This one is promising.  \\n\\nBetween my friend and I (2 peeps total), we knocked out  8 dim sum plates (approx $28 total).

The service was attentive and the hostess was very tactful.  We shared a table with others, but not even once did I feel we were left to dry.  \\n\\nThe steamed rice noodles felt lush and fresh.

I wasn't in the most forgiving mood and just wanted to go up to my room. When my husband booked our room we were given 2Q beds. Since we booked 3rd party I figured the front desk agent would attempt to charge me the difference if I asked to upgrade to a K room. To my surprise that's not what happened.\\n\\nNot only did Whitney Devaugn change my 2Qs to a K room, she did it without hesitation (and without the smile leaving her face). She was knowledgable of her hotel and took the time to find me the best room for me (Top Floor. Away from the elevators). She didn't act inconvenienced at all and something about her patience and demeanor changed my mood completely. The cherry on top was her professionalism, presenting me with her business card when I asked how to write her a review. \\n\\nNow, this hotel isn't super ritzy, but you can tell it's stocked with upgrades you'd want from a hotel stay (Sundry, Pool, Bar area, Breakfast, Fitness). The bedrooms are pretty standard, but the bath/kitchen/living area is very clean and well designed. The room gives you communal space outside of your sleeping area as well as an option for cooking a meal. Two big things about home you start to miss, especially if you've been away for awhile.

Firstly, I believe their atmosphere and theme to be silly and derivative, and secondly, I'd rather spend my money on an establishment where the money flows more directly into the community. With that said, I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory at the Perimeter Mall and it warrants a review, for reasons both good and not so good. \\n\\nTo begin with, the interior of the restaurant looks like something one would find at Disneyworld - this is to say somewhat cute, an obvious attempt to come across as attractive. I don't even know where to begin to describe the d√©cor or this place - it had fake columns reminiscent of the Classical world,  carved faces in the fashion of the Aztecs and Mayans, and painted ceilings resembling poor man's imitation of Michelangelo. Weird, but not outright unattractive. \\n\\nThe Cheesecake Factory is always busy and doesn't take reservations on weekend nights during peak  hours. This means you will wait for 15 - 30 minutes to be seated. That's not so bad, but even though the restaurant is quite large, it's also cramped and loud making conservation quite difficult. The service is definitely friendly. I was asked, \\"How are you tonight, sir?\\" multiple times (which I presume to be a dictat from on high to the staff) but it's not very snappy, either. This is to be expected and forgiven in such a busy establishment, though. That said, it's not somewhere I'd recommend you go out for a date night or an intimate and relaxing dinner. \\n\\nThe menu is very extensive, almost overwhelming. Personally, I prefer a restaurant that trims downs it menu and focuses on doing several things very well, but the Cheesecake Factory takes the opposite, broader approach.  Now, to the most important part - the food. It's nothing to write home about but I certainly didn't leave hungry, either. I had the fried macaroni balls for the appetizer - rich and filling, and chicken pot stickers for dinner. I've certainly had better pot stickers, but they were quite good, served with a slightly crispy shell, chicken and seasoned with ginger soy sauce. I cleaned my plate and have no real complaint to deliver about the fare, but no accolades, either. \\n\\nThe drinks are a bit on the pricey end of normal. The house wine is $8.00 and the Lemon Drop I ordered was $10. Not outrageous, but more than what one would pay at a similar corporate chain restaurant. \\n\\nFinally, the place is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. Numerous varieties of that delicious pastry are available and if you like them as much as do I, you won't be disappointed. Personally, the Red Velvet is my favorite, but I plan on trying the numerous other varieties over time.\\n\\nFinally, The Cheesecake Factory is a  restaurant that does what it does without having a unique experience and serves good, though not exceptional food. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat here, but if you know what you're getting into, and want to take home a delicious cheesecake for a midnight snack, give it a shot. \\n\\nPros: CHEESECAKES. Extensive menu means that even pick eaters will be able to find something they enjoy.\\n\\nCons: Not much to offer in terms of ambiance, and while the food food is nominally good, nothing stands.\\n\\nVerdict: Recommended IF someone else is paying, or a group can't decide what kind of good to eat that night."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the Plain Jane smoked brisket, cooked to perfection!

We arrived at what looked like an apartment building a few minutes before class started and were led into one of the coolest spaces I've ever seen. The cooking school was partial loft/partial museum of art and antiques. The walls and ceilings were completely covered with gorgeous paintings, photographs and random objects. It was pretty incredible!\\n\\nWe took the class with 4 other couples, and I have to admit, it was a bit quiet and awkward at first. No one was really talking and I was worried the next few hours were going to be filled with everyone trying to whisper among themselves. Luckily, the classes are BYOB, so as soon as the wine started flowing everyone became more comfortable.\\n\\nAll of the classes at ArtEpicure are taught by Mark DesLauriers, who has over 30 years of cooking and restaurant experience in the US and across the world. To start, Mark talked us through the menu and explained why he chose certain items. For the seafood class, he decides the menu based on what is the most fresh at the fish market that morning.\\n\\nTo get us going, Mark designated tasks to prep for each course, including chopping vegetables and herbs, creating the cake mix for dessert, cleaning mussels, cutting and searing fish, cooking rice and beans, and plating when everything was finished.\\n\\nAll of the prep took a couple of hours, so by the time the first course was ready I was starving! Our three course dinner consisted of:\\n\\n1. Mussels in a pesto sauce with toasted bread\\n2. Pan roasted hake served with giant Greek beans, basmati rice, and roasted asparagus\\n3. Molten chocolate cake topped with caramel sauce\\n\\nAll of the food was fantastic, and I was especially excited about the chocolate cake -- something I've been wanting to make for ages but have been too intimidated to try on my own.\\n\\nWhile I loved both the food and the atmosphere, I think calling the experience a \\"class\\" is a little misleading. We didn't get to participate in the cooking or prep as much as I would have liked, and there were times when I felt we could have been more involved or called upon to help with tasks. I did learn a couple of neat tips and tricks (the proper way to hold a chef's knife, for instance), but was expecting far more participation. This class had more people than Mark anticipated, so I'm not sure how much that contributed to the way the evening played out. Still, it was a great night and I would definitely give ArtEpicure another shot!"},{"name":"Haley House Bakery Caf√©","address":"12 Dade St","city":"Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"The chocolate chip cookies are the bomb.

My Fianc√© ordered the chicken Marsala and chicken noodle soup. I ordered a turkey BLT and broccoli cheddar soup, thinking that at a deli, it would be a safe choice. I was wrong, the bread was stale and the sandwich came without condiments. It was so dry I could barely eat it. I tried to put mustard on it to help, but there was no helping the dryness. The soup was fine, although I certainly have had better. In fact, Panera's broccoli and cheddar soup is better. My fianc√© chicken Marsala seemed to completely lack Marsala wine.

It might look like a place where you can get Happy Meals, but burgers actually cost around $5 a pop not including fries and drinks.  Oh, come to think of it, another surprise:  you get to eat peanuts.   I've ever only seen this at country stores and Texas Roadhouse before.  \\n\\nOf course, if it really was a great burger the price would have been a none-issue.

It's like I'm a school yard bully who picks on the new kid out of fear that his/her novelty might somehow threaten my status on the pecking order. Let me preface this by saying that unlike many of the previous reviewers, I have never been to Turkey, so I was not trying to relive some glorious experience. And you don't have to sell me on the fact that your travels to Turkey were spectacular, because I believe you, and Turkey has long been on my short list of destinations to visit before I die. And I completely understand how the local cuisine was an integral part of the enjoyment you experienced while you were there.

After all, I am so happy to see a thriving restaurant occupy a space that had previously housed a series of failed business ventures. And I'm not going to take a star away from the restaurant for a lack of air conditioning during one of this summer's epic heat waves. It was our decision to leave the comfort of our air conditioned home. And I'm certainly not going to fault the restaurant for running out of entrees early in the evening. Popularity has its price, and at Istanbul'lu, popularity limited us to either sandwiches or tapas.\\n\\nSince tapas is a far more interesting word than sandwiches, we ordered an assortment to sample. We started with hummus as a safe and familiar option. It was pureed chickpeas with tahini, lemon, and garlic, as expected. It was certainly delicious, but was lacking one important element -- a vehicle with which to consume it. No pita, no flatbread, no bread of any kind with which to scoop this delicious dip into our hungry mouths. Next, we sampled the patlican salad, which was essentially roasted eggplant that was mashed and seasoned. Again, this might make a wonderful spread, but when I think of the word tapas, I think of a dish that can stand on its own, rather than something that requires another food item to be enjoyed. For our third tapas, we ordered the patlican rulo, which was grilled eggplant rolled with saut√©ed vegetables and topped with a yogurt sauce. While this definitely fit better into my definition of what tapas should be, unfortunately, it was a bit under seasoned for my taste. Lastly, we finished with the dolma, which was stuffed grape leaves with a yogurt sauce. This was truly delicious, and the best example of tapas we tasted that evening.\\n\\nOn the bright side, the service at Istanbul'lu was friendly and efficient. Drink options were limited to either hot beverages or a few cold non-alcoholic bottled beverages and canned sodas. Overall, the d√©cor was cute, tidy, and the restaurant was quite clean, as should be expected from any newly-opened restaurant. As the fates did not seem to align that night for anything better than an average experience, I am eager to give Istanbul'lu another try -- maybe breakfast, maybe dinner entrees, but surely something more substantial that the small plates we sampled that night."},{"name":"Red House Restaurant","address":"24 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"I must be the only guy on Yelp who likes this place...

You have to work slowly through several layers to reach satisfaction. She is hard to get, distant until you can get a seat next to her. She is from Italy, Genoa to be exact, and dressed in flowing designer creations. \\n\\nThe other sister is the one who sadly, you turn to because Genoa is out of your league, or just has too many suitors to get a chance to sit with her. \\n\\nSo you sit near her, in another room, glancing beyond the curtains for a glimpse. You get up to go to the restroom closer to her, to get a peek at her beauty. But you return to Acconto, her sister. \\n\\nAccanto is the less beautiful sister. She isn't as refined as Genoa, but she tries hard, and gives you enough to believe she might really be the sister, not a poser. But not enough to stay in the leagues of, say, Chez Panisse's little sister, the less refined one that lives upstairs in Berkeley. \\n\\nThe consolation prize is that Accanto doesn't have the expensive tastes that her sister Genoa has. \\n\\nStarters: from $7 - $15 Arancini, Fritto Misto, for example, $9 each.\\n\\nSnacks and Sides: $3 - $5. Olives, Anchovies, Almonds, (all $3), etc. \\n\\nSandwiches: ( I told you she was less refined!) served until 5pm only. \\n\\nPlates: $13 - $20 I tried the Squid Ink Spaghetti ($15).

Reasonably satisfying. \\nAlso: Squash and Potato Gnocchi, Spinach Lasagna, Herb Paparadelle, Duck Breast, Crispy Pork Belly and Braised Short Ribs, or Wild Mushroom stuffed Trout. \\n\\nDesserts: All $7. Tiramisu, Apple Crostada, Chocolate Budino, Gelatos and Sorbetto. I tried the Affogato, which is vanilla gelato with espresso poured over it, with a large biscotti. \\n\\nThe place is casual, bistro style, well lit an unadorned. The food is decent. The portions are smaller than most, the flavors, like the ugly sister, trying a little too hard to please and not really getting your juices flowing. You don't run away, but you don't linger too long. \\n\\nThey do have a happy hour and reverse happy hour, and are open 7 days a week, and serve weekend brunch as well. \\n\\nThis sister was built more for fun, not beauty.

The service is... odd. \\n\\nI've been here twice: once with a partner, and once alone.\\n\\nWhen I went with a partner, we thought our food was good, but our service seemed excessively slow. It took a lot of time to get the attention of the waiters, and it wasn't like the restaurant was very busy at that time. Our food seemed to take longer than expected to arrive (they do not give you enough bread), but I'll chalk that up to everything being freshly made. Our waiter seemed a bit off. He was very friendly, seemed a bit awkward, and moved quite slowly. When we asked for a refill of the bread, he gave us a very hesitant yes, but never came back with more bread. \\n\\nWhen I went alone, I had a very different experience. I told them table for 1, and I think I got extra special attention because of it. They offered me a window seat with some nice sunlight coming though and they seemed very accommodating. They were very attentive to me, and I felt like I was getting almost too much attention, but it was very nice. I ordered, and sat there eating my bread. This time, I assumed that there was no refills on bread, so I sat there browsing on my phone waiting for my food. They noticed I had been waiting a while, so my waiter comes up to me and he actually says \\"Can I get you some more bread?\\". I love their bread so I enthusiastically said yes. Shortly afterwards, my food came, but that extra bread was no where to be found! This time, not only was I lied to, but it was when they OFFERED me more bread. \\n\\nThe food was high quality pasta; it is good enough to warrant them 3 stars to make up for the strange service I received. I think it's appropriately priced with the Scoutmob deal (50% off M-Th), but it seems way overpriced if I were paying full price.

She asked if we would like to order food, we said we would take the lettuce wraps, and she abruptly told us that was only during happy hour and we needed to order off of the regular menu. (We were not given a regular menu, sorry.) Then Courtney did not come back to check on us for 15 minutes, so we decided to order our drinks ourselves at the bar. She intercepted our order by telling us we needed to order through her. (Would have loved to order through her, had she come to take our oder in a timely manner.) From this point on I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant. At one point I think she heard us discussing our poor service and got in my face to ask \\"If I needed anything from her.\\" (really she just heard my complaints and wanted to make it known.)

The meat is cut to order as you place it, in my case going with the chopped beef brisket instead of sliced. All of the meats are seasoned and slow smoked in hickory wood burning pits on-site daily. They were loading slabs of ribs in the smoker as I worked my way down the line to score my sides, green beans with bacon and fried okra.\\n\\nGrabbing one of their Big Yellow Cups, I filled it up to the top with their house brewed sweet tea and found a small table to dig into my eats.

While they don't offer actual silverware here they do give you some quality plasticware that won't snap land break like some places offer.\\n\\nDigging into my plate made me realize why I love this BBQ chain so much, great deep flavoured meats and tasty sides at decent prices compared to some of the other local BBQ joints.

Anyway, we went ahead and picked the Smoked Trout Rillette Benny and Hippy Hash Bowl. Both dishes left a lot to be desired, both visually and taste-wise.\\n\\nBenny: There was barely any trout on the muffins; and the cold and soggy hash browns (see pic) were haphazardly strewn on the plate, with a third of the plate empty in a way to almost suggest part of the dish was missing.

I only realized this last point as I was writing this review; otherwise I would have brought it to their attention. The presentation of the Benny lacked any care or love and the taste was as bland as it gets.\\n\\nThe Hippy Hash:  This was no better.

I often have a seafood pasta as an entree.  The last time I visited, I had the smoked salmon linguini; a very common selection from any Italian restaurant, so it is always down to who preparers it the best.  Don Francesco's does a good job.  The pasta wasn't too salty, which is easy to do with this dish, and the cream was not too rich.  I also had a tomato burrata salad for an appetizer.  It was a very generous portion of burrata.

I would note that this place is not ideal if you are looking for a light meal - between the oils and yogurts used for many of the dishes, Istanbul'lu can certainly take a toll on your waistline if not visited in moderation (I oftentimes have trouble restraining myself).\\n\\nMy personal recommendations would be any dish with their mouth-watering kofte kebab (minced lamb), or fried eggplant (my favorite dish is the patlican sarma, which incorporates both). Their salads, cheeses, and dolma (stuffed grape leaves) are all fantastic as well, so I would encourage anyone to have fun exploring the menu. \\n\\nAs for dessert, you would be making a grave mistake by leaving before trying their kunefe - soft cheese pastry soaked in honey and topped with pistachios.

I've bowled here a couple of times and it is definitely a nice bowling alley. The lanes work well (no jamming or ball return issues) and there are tv screens all around to watch some sports while bowling. It's definitely more of a fun place to go, so if you are a serious bowler trying to practice for a league or something, then you would probably want something thats a little more calm and less distracting.\\n\\nAfter bowling this last time, we wandered over to the pool hall and decided to play for an hour. The tables are in decent condition, but they need to do a better job at not putting everyone at tables next to each other when there are plenty of other tables in the back not being used.\\n\\nThe food there is okay, nothing special but good enough to munch on while you play. I tasted some of my friend's sesame ginger chicken wings which didnt taste very flavorful and the dipping sauce was too spicy for me. But then I ordered potato skins and those were really good, so I recommend those if you want a cheap appetizer.\\n\\nThe main problem we had though was that the people who work there don't do much to enforce safety and stop chaos. We had a whole family that stayed on the lane together the entire time and the little girl kept hanging on the ball return and sticking her hand in. The waitress told them once that she needed to get off it, but she didnt even stay there to make sure the girl actually got off it...and of course the girl did not. \\n\\nI know the bowling alley's job isnt to teach good parenting, but they should be concerned about the safety of those playing. There were a few times where some of the kids would start to wander on our lane as we were actually bowling and we had to move out of the way and stop ourselves from knocking the kids over or pelting them with the bowling ball!!"},{"name":"Red Wraps","address":"1208 Chicon St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Hot fire.

Once inside though, things did not improve much.  I was happily greeted at the entrance by a sign: \\"Please Seat Yourself.\\"  No host.  It was a Friday night at 8pm, and after we made our way to the one open table, my dinner partner and I discovered we could barely hear each other.\\n\\nThe noise in this place was a bit overboard, something that could probably be tempered with the addition of just a little fabric somewhere, aside from the three meager curtains along the east side of the building.  To top it off, one patron, a frat boy type, apparently couldn't restrain some kind of victory scream halfway through dinner.\\n\\nThis brings me to my next point.  The whole atmosphere was just lame.  The decor was stripped right out of Urban Redevelopment Iz Us: new, plastic, and innocuous.  The air conditioning was cranked up to frigid, almost enough to convince my stomach it wasn't hungry after all.  This, combined with the absence of a host, the waitstaff with average age of 23, all wearing blue jeans and T-shirts, and the tacky table displays advertising happy hour and Primizie T-shirts, really cheapened the feel of this potentially classy restaurant.  \\n\\nBut it wasn't all bad.  Service was prompt and polite, if not a little detached, the wait on the food was long but still reasonable, and the food itself was respectable.  I tried the Insalata Mista, the Goat Cheese and Scallion Ravioli, and for dessert, the waitress's pick, Crostata di Mela.\\n\\nThe salad was made with high quality flavorful greens, had an interesting quickly grilled avocado half (done just for show I think), and was topped with a delicious red chili and olive vinaigrette with just the right amount of sweetness.  The portion was small but reasonable.\\n\\nThe ravioli dish was a winner with my dinner party, though those 6 lonely ravioli could have used some company on the plate.  The goat cheese and scallion was a delicious combination, though I'd recommend a higher ratio of scallion, and worked really well with the black olive butter sauce with sauteed spinach.  The ravioli was cooked perfectly: firm and slightly chewy. \\n\\nOur apple tart dessert was a little dry, but still enjoyable and nicely presented.  What was especially interesting about it was the brown butter gelato topping it.  I would have liked to try this flavor on its own, but it didn't stand out atop a dessert already composed with butter.\\n\\nWhat Primizie does have going for it is its attention to food; they use high quality ingredients and the dishes are competently executed.\\n\\nSadly, what it is lacking is atmosphere; it runs low on personality, comfort, and aesthetics.  This detracted enough from the value of my experience to make dining here not worth the price.  \\n\\nI don't think I will be back.  There is equally as good Italian food to be found elsewhere, where I'll enjoy a much more pleasant experience.\\n\\nCome on, east side, will you really not emit even a squeak under the boot of gentrification?"},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Pretty nice place!

You get what you give off. Period. The hostess was so friendly, seated us right away. After a personal greeting and handshake from the (owner/manager?) who thanked us for coming in, in no time at all, one of the many waiters was there for our cocktail order. I knew right away they knew exactly what they were doing. Dinner like this is not to be rushed. Cocktails, (they make a mean lemon drop) followed by soup or salad (a nice white or rose to accompany that) and your main (a nice hearty red) and desert and an aperitif. This is not high turnover, get you in and get you out but real dinning. If you want the manufactured experience, go next door to Joeys with food that comes off a truck and a server asking you every 5 minutes if the food is okay. This wonderful little place doesn't have to ask as they KNOW their food is great and have faith in their chef. That is the way it's supposed to be. \\nSilverware was changed for every course quickly and efficiently without our conversation being interrupted. Plates were removed quietly with a deft manner only found in very rare places. \\nEach new course was only brought when the last course was finished and not when it came off the line as we were not rushed. We felt as though we were treasured regulars even though we had never set a foot there until last night. \\nThe food was beyond expectations, try the lobster bisque, it is one of the best I've had.

I've received replies to less than stellar reviews before, but i always got the feeling they were just trying to appease me to get me to change my review and they actually didn't care about my satisfaction. Not the case with Salt & Straw. plus, it's not like a 3 star review warrants a response and offer to come in and try their ice cream again on them\\n\\nAnd in terms of my comment about their ice cream being too creamy - turns out that's what they're going for. They use dairy at 17% butter fat. That's very high - higher than I've heard of before. Typically even premium ice creams max out at 16%. I'll chalk this one up to preference. i don't like ice cream that creamy, but many do. I think ice cream that creamy is slimy, coats the mouth and leaves a slimy film.

We ordered for take out and by the time I got home 20 mins later the taco was falling apart and I couldn't pick it up. I wound up eating the inside of the taco with a fork and throwing out the tortillas but the meat WAS good. They give you a very large amount of chips and only one cup of \\"salsa\\" aka pico de gallo. Unless the girl made a mistake, the salsa and pico were the same exact thing. Still good though.

Top it with the crispy fried onions, and you will be in heaven.  The fries are Outstanding!  And, when you pair them with any of their dipping sauces, it puts them over the top.  My favorite, I think, is the Mohawk sauce, which is like a slightly spicy aioli, with a little garlic kick (but don't pass up trying any of the other 6 or 7 they offer - I haven't had a bad one. If you are a mustard lover, the Mustard Mohawk can't be beat). My wife had the mac and cheese, topped (if memory serves) with crispy onions, and loved it.\\n\\nThey're also doing breakfast, which we had to head back in the morning and try out (and considering the dearth of good breakfast joints around here [RIP Little Red Bike], this is a very welcome addition) and we were not disappointed.  The breakfast grilled cheese was stellar, with tempeh bacon and delicious thick-cut bread (tasted like Grand Central Bakery, but they were too busy to ask), fried egg, (Tillamook?) cheese, and some of that super tasty Mustard Mohawk sauce, it makes me start to drool just thinkin about it.  Be warned, though, both the breakfast sandwiches and the burgers are Huge, so bring a healthy appetite!\\n\\nRyan and Terri, who own and run the cart, are really nice and super friendly, and they said that not only can you sub tempeh bacon for the meaty variety on all of the breakfast dishes, you can also replace the eggs with tofu, and Ryan was *very* proud of his tofu skills, so I will have to give that a try soon, when I inevitably go back."},{"name":"Pied-√†-Terre","address":"3369 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Came here with some friends for a birthday celebration AND also for my first taste of Foie Gras!\\n\\nIt's definitely a good idea to make a reservation as this is a smaller restaurant with not a lot of seating. \\n\\nThe service was very good and the atmosphere cozy and classy.

On TV it looked great...a small intimate atmosphere with great food. \\n\\nDON'T BE FOOLED!!!  We had an absolutely terrible experience dealing with this restaurant.\\n\\nFor months after seeing the episode on TV we attempted to eat here.  Each time we learned how their process worked...or so we thought.  That is, that they promote the fact that they seat people on a first come, first serve basis...unless, you make a reservation of a party of 6 or more people.  Seems like something anyone can manage if you know in advance, right?  WRONG!!!!\\n\\nWe called Rino's last friday afternoon at 4:00pm and were told there was no wait at all, so we decided to go there to eat.  By the time we got there the woman seating people said there were \\"3 parties in front of us, and it wouldn't be a long wait at all\\".  So we decided to wait.  What we then watch play out in front of our eyes was anything but a short wait.\\n\\nBecause we waited right out in front of the restaurant we could see all the tables, just as if we were inside.  TWICE we watched as three tables opened up and they then pushed them together to accommodate groups that had reservations.  THEY NEVER TOLD US WE HAD TO WAIT BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO HAD RESERVATIONS.  So essentially, even though we were 3rd on a list of people signed in to get a table based on a first come, first serve basis we were behind all the booked reservations they already had.  This means, that becase they pushed three open tables together (a total of 6 open tables) to accommodate the reservations we were 'really' 9th on a list of open tables!!!!!!!!!!  AND THEY NEVER TOLD US THIS!!!\\n\\nWe ended up waiting over 90 minutes before we realized what they were doing and we left without eating.  And it seemed very apparent that they were accommodating locals from the neighborhood at our expense!!!  One hour and 45 minutes (Is this a short wait to you?) after signing in for a table they called us on our cell phone to inform us our table was ready.  When I asked the woman (Debbie) why she didn't inform us why we had to wait behind the groups who had reservations she had no answer.  Worse yet....she could care less that we had waited all that time!!!  She was so rude!!!!!\\n\\nSo the food is probably great...I have no idea!!!  What I do know for a 'fact' is that they're manipulative and have no idea what customer service means.

I honestly thought that we were being treated that way because the servers did not think we were going to tip them well. But it is not fair for someone to judge us before they even served us. We had to inform someone that we had not been seen. And even after we told the hostess we were still not seen. I had to ask for a manger to explain that we had been waiting for so long and it was not fair especially since all the surrounding restaurants were preparing to close.

I almost thought I had wondered in to the wrong building by mistake when I joined a friend here for dinner the other night. \\n\\nI'm a firm believer that no matter how good your food is, if the service is bad, you're out of luck as an establishment. After being seated, we waited more than 20 minutes for the waiter to come and take our drink order; this was after my patience finally wore thin and I had to call him over to the table. I asked him to recommend a good cocktail. He pointed out one on the menu and I accepted the recommendation. Later when he brought the drinks, he realized he had brought me the wrong one but because I had asked for a recommendation, I guess he felt at liberty to tell me, \\"Oh, you'll like this one too. It's good;\\" instead of going through the trouble of changing it.\\n\\nI ordered the coq au vin, quite a good dish. The coq was wonderfully tender, flavorful, and authentic. My friend ordered the beef short rib bourginon, also very tasty. \\n\\nWhen it came time for dessert, as the waiter was taking our order, I made the side comment, \\"I'm in the mood for chocolate.\\" The sort of thing you say to keep the waiter's attention while you debate between the profiteroles and the souffle. The waiter saw it as much more.He seized the opportunity; snatching the menu out of my hands, nearly pinching my fingers in the fold, and informing me, \\"I know the perfect thing. I'll surprise you. You'll love it.\\" I didn't ask for a surprise but had no time to protest as the waiter scurried off to the kitchen. Skeptical, I rather assumed the thing I would \\"love\\" would of course end up being the most expensive dessert item on the menu. I chided myself a bit for being so cynical. This is a pretty classy place, no? A waiter here would never pull such a cheap stunt. Wrong. Indeed, a few minutes later the gateau au chocolat petit robert arrived with a teetering milk chocolate Eiffel Tower figurine. Some comments: 1) This is indeed the most expensive item on the menu containing chocolate. 2) Presentation is important but I'm not one for these cheap gimmicks-- a milk chocolate Eiffel Tower? Is there any brasserie in Paris that would serve you something like that (other than those completely laden with tourists?)? 3) I've had better chocolate cake. \\n\\nIn summary, at Petit Robert Central you can get a solid meal in a pretty restaurant. Unfortunately, given my experience, I cannot recommend this place for its good table service. To their credit, they have not been open long at this locale and may still be working out the kinks. Who knows? Maybe the waiter I had isn't even there anymore...for your sake I hope he's not."},{"name":"Unity Vegan Kitchen","address":"1210 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"we visited this food truck twice on our weekend trip to austin because the food was so good. i had the chickun and waffles with peppery gravy and the cheese steak sandwich with curly fries. it was so delicious and the food truck area was really cute and relaxing. there is nothing like waking up to delicious chickun and waffles while eating with the warm texas sun on your face. i can't wait to come back!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I first stopped into Toro Bravo, same owner, and was told it'd be a 30 minute wait to be seated so they recommended I try Tasty n Sons.

I went through a spicy thai phase where I ordered variations of the same dish (drunken noodle) for three months straight. Each time the dish tasted the same, had about the same amount of meat(or tofu), noodles, vegetables, spice, etc. Once you understand their food, you can expect it to be a certain way all of the time. They've really perfected the flavors in some of their dishes, like the Tom Yum Soup, which makes me sweat every time. I really like how you can build your own meal.

Cute interior-- really clean and spare\\n2. Parking lot behind the building/row-- nice and convenient, especially in this burgeoning area\\n3. Polite waitstaff-- very pleasant folks\\n\\nHowever, there are some problems:\\n\\n1. SLOW service-- our server seemed harried and distracted, even though she was nice (this is what took this place from a three-star to a two star)-- there were two points during the meal I had an empty glass for well over 10 minutes\\n2. Loud room-- probably wouldn't have noticed if we hadn't been dying of thirst, but... we were, so I did\\n3. A bit crammed-- every time I turned to get up, I felt like I was joining the meal at the table next to us\\n\\nAnd here's some ambiguity:\\n\\n1. I had the \\"opportunity\\" to watch several people almost eat concrete before coming into the restaurant, due to the awkward arrangement of the sidewalk in front-- whether that is a plus or a minus depends on how much your personal sense of humor hinges upon schadenfreude.

The Fritto Misto was OUTSTANDING! Oh, my golly, it was good. Be sure to try one of the fried lemon slices-- I ate it for science this time around, but in the future it will be all about pleasure. The calamari was also quite fresh, and everything on the plate was flavorful. We also had a very nice cheese plate, with honey, fruit, and flatbread.\\n\\nFor my entree, I had the lasagna bolognese. It was only so-so. Not bad, just not great. Nothing to really distinguish it from frozen lasagna, beyond the presentation. The top layer, which I generally expect to be chewy, cheesy, and flavorful, was just rubbery.\\n\\nMy friend had the bistecca, which she seemed to enjoy. One of the nice things about this place is that they box your leftovers nicely when you leave, and she took part of hers home in a cute little box when we ended the meal.

We had the torta di limone, which is basically a lemon cheesecake. The filling and sauce had a nice flavor, but the crust was a bit... resistant.

We arrived at around 8pm and had to wait about 30 minutes, which actually wasn't so bad, considering we were a larger party.  We all got a drink at the bar, stood around, and were able to do some people watching, which is another favorite activity of mine.  People were hanging around decked out in costumes, which I learned was for a costume contest.  All the wait staff were dressed in costume too, which provided a cool, fun vibe.\\n\\nThere is a separate beer and cocktail menu, a special menu (written both on chalkboard wall and handed to you on a sheet of paper), and the dinner menu which was super appealing. The boyfriend and I ended up sharing the Spicy Coconut Curried Goat Stew ($18.95) which came with jasmine rice & fried sweet plantains, the special of the day which was a Grilled and Braised Short Rib over cheesy polenta, garlicy greens, and a cranberry mostarda ($20.95).  The flavors of both dishes were excellent: the short rib melted completely off the bone and the cranberry mostarda was like the icing on the cake.  The goat stew is something everyone has raved about, and we were not disappointed: It had rich flavors and tasted as if it were cooked for hours.\\n\\nWe were so impressed with the main courses that we decided to order the Warm Banana Bread Pudding ($7, with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce) for dessert.  The sauce was delicious but there was a lot of it; also, the vanilla ice cream melted against the warmth of the pudding, creating a soupy like mixture at the bottom of the bowl.  Either you love it or you hate it: I actually didn't mind too much.  FYI, if you do want more ice cream, they charge $2 per scoop.  \\n\\nIn reality, I'd probably downgrade the 4 stars to 3 and half for a few reasons: It's super loud in Highland Kitchen, making it impossible to flag down our waitress when two people in our party were missing their dessert.  That hiccup which happened toward the end of our meal, left a slightly sour impression on the group, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt and upgrade the review to a 4."},{"name":"Avenue Thai and Sushi","address":"525 S Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"The food was very good.

The chicken heart was honestly just kind of gross. It wasn't that they had prepared it badly it was just the idea of eating a heart. The hearts were vey chewy and slightly bitter. Even frying couldn't hide that. The shrimp tacos came with guacamole and cheese, but I felt that they lacked zest. Good, not great.

So first impression, I initially just tried the chicken, eh crispy but plain tasting. Didn't care for it. I then started eating the chicken and waffle with the syrup and it was alright. I was kind of disappointed at this point because I had such high expectations. BUT then I tried the chicken and waffles with the hot sauce and the syrup and I couldn't believe it, it tasted soo amazing!! I'm not a crazy fan of hot sauce and since the syrup was Fresno pepper-maple syrup I figured it would taste just as good without it, but I was wrong! Eat it with both and then just enjoy it. My chicken and waffles craving dismissed after that meal, I was so content! Oh and the chicken and waffles is pretty big, I split it with one other person, and that must be common because our waiter brought it out already split into 2 halves and with two pieces of chicken on each half for both of us. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come back again for the chicken and waffles or try something new on the menu."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Amazing place to play pool and bowling.

I brought some family whom were visiting from out of town and had previously read great reviews; however, I am simply unimpressed. There are some creative and ambitious takes on dishes that simply fell short for me.\\n\\nSwift's Attic has a wonderful ambiance, quirky style, and great service. Our server was animated and fun to talk to; however, the food simply does not hold a candle to the ambiance or whatever appeal this place offers. To start, the drinks: I ordered one of their Ice Ball Cocktails which sound like a good idea, but in practice are not. The idea behind these drinks is the mix for the drink is frozen into one large ball, then they pour the alcohol over it. Starts off with a kick, then gets smoother as you get further through it. While this seems like a great way to keep your drink cold without using ice, it is far from practical. The ice ball simply takes too long to melt, so you have two options:\\n\\n1. You can drink the drink and end up finishing the alcohol long before the drink melts (By the time my food came and I had finished eating it was still not melted).\\n2. You can crush up the ice ball, defeating the whole purpose of the drink.\\n\\nI would not recommend these drinks: they are an ambitious attempt that simply falls flat on its face. Order a normal drink and save yourself the hassle. Unless you want to have a non-alcoholic drink after your shot, whatever floats your boat.\\n\\nThe food on the other hand is hit or miss. Most people dining with me ordered the Braised Windy Hill Goat Shoulder, which was served with ricotta gnocchi, smoked fig-tomato ragout, and arugula pesto. This dish was enjoyable and made me regret my decision. I decided to order the Orange is the New Quail, which was an orange spiced quail with lardo, bok choy, fennel, black rice, and a black garlic vin. For a dish being called \\"Orange is the New Quail,\\" you would expect a strong orange flavor, wouldn't you? The orange flavor was not very prevalent in my dish, the quail was a little on the dry side, and overall the best thing about this dish is the name. The bok choy was good, but I would advise avoiding this dish altogether. \\n\\nFinally, a common sentiment everyone at the table shared was the portions were too small. After finishing our meals we were all still hungry and ended up getting a slice of pizza on 6th street after just to fill ourselves up. Between the disappointing drinks, hit-or-miss food, and small portions for the price, the value simply is not here. I reluctantly give this place 3 stars since there are some good dishes (like the goat shoulder) and the ambiance/service were great. However, I think Yelp says it best with 2 stars when I say \\"Meh.

The crostini was rye sandwich loaf that was lightly toasted. Sliced bread is not crostini and the rye spiked the who flavor balance. For entrees we had the mussels with salad and the snapper. The mussels were good, the salad was half wilted. The snapper selection needs to be better. The sauce and veggies were great but they need to change their fish source. Dessert was a complete bomb. We ordered key lime pie but we got a pastry tart 4 inches wide with a ricotta lime ish filling.

I also like that you can go whole hog with the menu and spend a ton, if you feel like it, or get some soup and a side and keep it reasonable. \\n\\nThough I'm not generally a big chain restaurant person, and don't often prefer the northern environs of Austin, I could definitely see myself going back.

For the first time in my life, I sent something back to the kitchen. \\n\\nMy friends all teased me that they would be spitting on my food but I work in a restaurant and know that when people send food back, usually it's not that big of a deal and if the kitchen has erred, they will make it right.  And I don't think anyone could have looked at my burger and classified it as rare/mid-rare.  They made me another burger -- this one was solidly mid-rare and could have been rarer, but that's ok.  It was delicious and they took it off the bill, which was a classy move.  \\n\\nThe cocktails are delicious and STRONG.  They have a good wine list, though the servers are not the most knowledgeable about it.  Love the karaoke on Wed. nights -- only complaint there is that it only lasts for 2 hours and they have a lot of regulars who sign up fast.  I wish HK had a 2 am liquor license, but I'm sure they would if they could and I blame Somerville, not them.\\n\\nDoes it bum me out when I have to wait for a table or the bar is mobbed 3 people deep?

Chicken ranges in price from $1-3 per piece, sides are $3 each, and they offer rolls, biscuits, sandwiches, drinks, and a variety of sauces. \\n\\nI love fried chicken! Like love it, love it! Good fried chicken is one of the ways to my heart. I judge fried chicken by the breading, seasoning, and crunch of skin to juicy interior contrast. With that being said, Hop's is good in my book. The chicken had a good combination of the above. I ordered a wing, drumstick and a side of macaroni and cheese. The meal ran me a little over $6. I tried a friends Nashville Hot Chicken and I wasn't a fan. The sauce was much different than the Hot Chicken I've tasted previously. \\n\\nIf I were visiting Ponce City Market in the future and wanted something inexpensive and quick, I'd stop at Hop's again."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"fresh roll is so good! their pho is def one of the best in town and they even say the simmer the broth for 24 hours ! it's super rich and beefy and delicious. also... their pork belly is delicious. super crispy on the skin side and deliciously fatty on the meat part. their ice tea drinks are also delicious and flavorful. the best deal pricewise here tho is the bahn mi which is huge for being only like 6.50. the other stuff is a couple dollars more expensive than I'd like it to be ($10-12 not including drink) but overall, definitely worth it. the place itself is also super clean, cute, and the workers are super nice."},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and I couldn't be happier that we did.

Nice that they have specials in the dining area too, but weird that it's different from the bar specials...at the bar cocktails were half off. Not sure if the waiter told us wrong... 2 girls ordered Sangria and suddenly the waiter started pushing sangria on everyone. \\"they're getting sangria, is that what you want too?\\"  And it wasn't said in a friendly way.  We soon ordered. He messed up the salad order, but fixed it right away, but then asked us whose order he should put the extra salad on.  Uhh, YOU messed up and brought an extra one, not us!  Luckily he dropped that one quick. \\nOne of the girls had to leave early and took the server receipt by mistake. The waiter noticed her error and was so mad. I understand his frustration, but his reaction  to it was so bizarre. He wanted us to call her, kept going on about it. If he would have just casually told us her mistake we would have given him her $2.50 tip.

We opted to leave, extremely upset, and we won't be returning.  It is one thing to be a known establishment with a reputation for delicious food, but driving away customers with rudeness is never the answer to continued success, in my opinion."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Another day and another brunch, this one before heading to the Pacific Coast, would see me visit Tasty and Sons; the small plates restaurant from the team behind Toro Bravo seemingly a perfect place to experience a large representative example of what the kitchen could do without being wasteful (or entering a food coma that would make it difficult to make the round trip to Seaside and back without pulling over for a nap.)  Warned by many of hour-plus waits even on weekdays and myself arriving at the Williams Avenue location just minutes before 9:00, having already stopped downtown for coffee and canele at Courier plus a box of Voodoo Doughnuts, I have to say I was still surprised - a small line of a dozen folks already waiting by the door and starting the procession inside as I parked the car.\\n\\nFitting the style I've come to realize is ubiquitous to much of Portland's dining scene - that being music that is slightly too loud, chairs that are a little too hard, cement floors, brick walls, and lots of reclaimed wood with open industrial ceilings - the first thing that struck me beyond the superficial aspects of Tasty n' Sons was something else I found common in Portland; friendly and attentive service that carried from the hostess stand to my server, a pleasant young woman at the bar where I'd requested to sit and being the only solo diner in the place for the first half hour the service offered was essentially one to one - plates arriving with impeccable timing and coffee (probably a gallon of Stumptown Hairbender when it was all said and done) refilled without hesitation.\\n\\nHaving again received a suggestion from service that I felt short sighted - specifically that I may have ordered 'too much' - without even knowing I'd already been to Courrier and Voodoo as I chuckled at a quote on the wall from Point stating \\"before judging a thin man one must get some information, perhaps he was once fat\\" my meal at Tasty n' Sons began with a pair of small snacks - the first a fluffy Chocolate Potato Doughnut resting in a thin pool of rich Cr√®me Anglaise and the second a Bacon Wrapped Date stuffed with an almond, griddled, and drizzled with Maple Syrup; both items signatures and both outstanding.\\n\\nProgressing next to heavier options, \\"Auntie Paula's French Toast\\" arrived next and although a decent version of my favorite breakfast item the caramelized and lightly singed brioche was simply too 'bready' on the interior to match my tastes for more custard laden options.  Offered as a dessert with ice cream and in my case served with pear infused maple and whipped cream there are simply far too many exemplary French Toasts in PDX to bother with this one - particularly when the following dish, a far more simple \\"Toast & Jam\\" was vastly more complex, a thin layer of Teleme Cheese melted on each slice while pear and pineapple preserves split time in adding light, natural sweetness.\\n\\nFor my 'main' course, if such a thing can be had at Tasty n' Sons, the Open Faced Monte Cristo would prove to be not only delicious, but also a veritable bargain with a substantial amount of thinly sliced ham perched atop bread what seemed to be the very same bread as featured in Paula's French Toast, but more most and certainly more saturated with flavor, in this case a sort of pimento pepper spiced maple syrup that was certainly spicy but not overwhelmingly so and a lovely compliment to the creamy cheese and savory pork.\\n\\nLast, and certainly not least, the team at Tasty n' Sons definitely went out on a high note with their off-menu special dessert, the \\"Griddled Rum Cake with Banana and Bacon\\" a sort of hybrid cross between the traditional French Baba with its golden yeasty crumb and a more pedestrian coffee cake with a streusel topping and thicker crust both infused with hefty notes of rum and drizzled with local honey.  Intense, flavorful, and topped with a strip of smoky bacon plus caramelized bananas this was the sort of dish that comes out of nowhere and steals the show in an otherwise entirely satisfying meal, pushing it to a whole different level - a level that ALMOST saw me visit the newly opened Tasty n' Adler a few days later before deciding to save it for another trip - a choice that, in retrospect, I regret because at least two (and more likely four) of my subsequent morning meals would have been better spent at one of John Gorham's Tasty locations."},{"name":"Dave & Buster's","address":"2215 D And B Dr SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"I came here as the first time ever being in a Dave an busters (been in Jillian though) and it was a lot to take in.

Winsor, I must have eaten here for at least ten times by now. This review is mainly for the dim sum menu, as I have not yet ventured too far into their entree menu.\\n\\nIf you want decent dim sum in Boston, the place I would recommend you is Winsor Dim Sum Cafe. As far as I know, they are the only restaurant that offers dim sum any day of the week from open to close. That said, there are a few of my favorites that are only available on the weekends. But if you want to avoid the wait, weekday lunches and dinners are better bets.\\n\\nSome people might not like the lack of push carts in Winsor. If you're looking for the push cart experience, then I'd recommend you to go to He Lai Moon instead. Personally, I prefer the quality of dim sum at Winsor more, and I like knowing that what I ordered is prepared (at least relatively) fresh.\\n\\nI have tried their XO BBQ buns, Beef Stomach, Preserved Egg and Pork Congee, Fake Shark Fin Dumplings, Turnip Cakes, and Fried Cullers Wrapped in Rice Noodles. My boyfriend and I often order the Choy Sum (a type of Chinese veggie) and Panfried Noodles. Everything's quite tasty. Out of all of those, I very rarely see the fried cullers in rice noodles dish at other dim sum places around Boston, and Winsor does it very well. So try it if you haven't yet!\\n\\nAs for service, I never have high expectations when I go to Chinatown restaurants, since you go for the food and not fancy treatment.

We flagged down the nearest person, which happened to be a manager, who had about as much grasp of the english language as our server did of the beer menu.

But there was no ketchup or hot sauce. I was starting to feel like a pain in the a** but I asked for them anyways (we had fries... it needs ketchup). When it was dropped of we were left with tobasco.

We signed our name to the list, and sat a spell outside perusing the menu. 15 minutes later, we were sat inside at a table so close to the other people we were pretty much in their conversations and could've eaten off their plates if we'd so desired. This is a common seating arrangement in small Portland places, so we shrugged.

Someone walked passed and dropped a small bowl of thimble-sized food we couldn't identify, we stared at it, puzzled, as it unceremoniously clunked on the table. With our servers explanation later,we discovered they were scone samples. Excited to try them, we quickly discovered they were dry and flavorless. Onward with the meal.\\nOur drinks came- the Orange cremsicle drink was literally the best part of the meal, it was light and delicious. The woman next to us had a blood orange mimosa, which she adored and it looked amazing (remember, I had a close up view of their meal too...). Our food came 1 hour later. Yes, you read that right. One hour. Our server was nice and apologetic, but we were hot and hungry at this point. When the food came, we'd wished we hadn't waited. The croque Monsieur had chewy meat, good cheese much of which had melted off the sandwich though, and a mustard that was far too spicy. The side salad was lettuce with dressing. My husbands sandwich was far better but still not great, and the potatoes were good. Overall, to have waited 1.5 hours in total for our meal, and for over $30, we left disappointed that'd we'd shelled out the time and money for potatoes and an orange drink essentially.

It's very easy to find, and lots of pretty views along the way.  We went on a Saturday afternoon, and while the business was steady it didn't seem too busy, maybe because of all the seating.  There's a bar inside along with plenty of tables and chairs, and additional seating on the back patio.  The patio is super nice, with a view of a farm that brings in the occasional cow visitor along the fence.  There's also a small stage outside, but unfortunately no live music the day we visited.  The menu consists of \\"craft\\" foods, we both had a burger with side of hushpuppies.  Flavorful, high quality meat, big portions. Amazing. You order at the window and they bring the food out to you, no waiters/waitresses.  The bar has a really great beer selection and also craft cocktails that I'm assuming change regularly as they're written on chalkboards.  They looked really good and I look forward to trying some in the future.

We did have a couple of nice apps, including the pumpkin tortellini with gorgonzola cream sauce; and the prosciutto-wrapped bosc pears slices. The entrees though, were nothing special. The proteins and veggies were under seasoned and lacking any interesting or especially complementary flavors. We found ourselves finishing our meals more out of obligation than enjoyment. Dessert, tiramisu, was adequate. For the money, we could have eaten a lot better in Beverly.\\n\\nDid Chianti just stop trying when the new restaurants came to Cabot Street? It certainly seems that way. The awning is an eyesore. The framed celebrity headshots in the window have been so sun-bleached that Bill Cosby and his variegated sweater are now as white as Kenny Rogers. The menu covers are as shredded as an old vinyl chair. It's easy to see that, once upon a time, Chianti was the place to eat for local suburbanites unwilling to trek into Boston, but with so many in-town options now, Chianti needs to decide if they want to participate in the restaurant renaissance or capitulate and fade away.\\n\\n*Update April 8, 2008:\\nWe returned to Chianti this evening and had a terrific four-course meal. The dilapidated menus had even been replaced. Did we just visit on an off night last time? Perhaps. Everything we tried tonight was delectable.

My personal favorites were the charred edamame (comes with a pop rock dip!), masa gnocchi, and squid fries. Each dish was a new gastronomical experience for me, combining unexpected items like lardo and strawberries or pork tacos and grilled grapefruit.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the meal was definitely the Strawberry Fields Ice Ball drink! Essentially, the mixer ingredients are frozen into a ball of ice and then combined with the alcohol in a glass. It naturally melts as you drink and after the first round you can top it off with additional shots, as it takes awhile for the ice ball to fully melt!\\n\\nOverall, it was a unique experience.

The biggest problem we had was the service. The server for our group was very inattentive. It took a long time for her to take our orders. We had to ask 3 times for her to bring bread and then she only brought one basket for a very large party. She never filled water glasses. We waited quite a while for the food.

The Thai garden salad was interesting with its array of eggs slices, cherry tomatoes, and green apple wedges, and it was also nicely portioned and well presented. The main dish, a spicy seafood in chili sauce with veggies, was somewhat small in portion for it's $18 price tag. The other entrees seemed highly priced, as well, and we were glad we came prepared with a restaurant.com certificate. I was also disappointed by catfish as the white fish used in their soups and main dishes - definitely a surprising choice for dishes with this price tag.\\n\\nService was alright.

Very friendly service. The menu is an extensive list of comfort food - just what you want from a diner - without being overbearing. They also don't put advertisements in the menu (I'm looking at you, North Ave Diner). \\n\\nThe best part is that they elevate the experience with things like fresh squeezed juice, real maple syrup, and locally-sourced ingredients. The end result is that it's an authentic diner experience, but you don't walk away feeling greasy and bloated. And I like that the servers' uniforms are local Wakefield sports teams. \\n\\nThere is a definite sense of class here (as far as diners go), with nice booths, lamps and overall decor - though a couple small aesthetic improvements would finish the job. For example, while I like the chalk diagram of massachusetts inside, it could be better drawn, and just feels a little dusty and sloppy. It's a great idea, but it would look even better in paint. (I do like the ever-changing chalkboard wall on the \\"waiting area\\" side - though I wouldn't want to brush up against it!). The interior lighting feels too bright and stark, dim those suckers and/or get softer bulbs! I also wish they'd get rid of the tacky backlit sign outside - something wood would be much nicer. \\n\\nAnyways, clearly I'm nitpicking, and probably being a snob. Certain restaurants (like Zuzu's, or The Porch on tuttle street) really go 110% and make the town a nicer place to be with great signage and curb appeal. Early Harvest Diner doesn't QUITE reach that point (hopefully they will with time as they become more established! Business seems to be booming). I am only even saying these things because, with their numerous other classy touches, you can tell the place WANTS to be at that level... it just needs a few hints for the finishing touches.\\n\\nBut hey, at least the food, service, and menu is great!

We had to wait for about 45 minutes, which I wasn't worried about at the time, but once the food came I was a little upset I had waited so long.  Now, admittedly at this point in my life I should know better than to order a steak at a chain restaurant and expect the world, but I had a big gift card so I figured what the hell.  And any chain establishment that's willing to charge $33 for a filet mignon had better mean business.  Well, suffice it to say the Cheesecake Factory does not mean business when it comes to the steaks.  The meat was just okay tasting.  Clearly not prime beef or anything close.  I guess I equated it to when you pay $33 for a steak at Ruth's Chris and the thing melts in your mouth and it's totally worth it.  Any establishment that can make meat melt is a-ok in my book, but there is no meat melting at the Cheesecake Factory people.  Let it be known.  The whole thing just tasted like a halfway decent piece of meat drenched in Worstershire sauce and a few spices.  Also, the fries I got were so bland and clearly frozen and that just sucks.  I mean, at this point if you're not doing fresh cut fries in your restaurant, I just do not understand what you are thinking.  They are such a crowd pleaser and not that difficult to make, but I digress.  I did not actually have the cheesecake, which was probably a mistake, but I was too full of mediocre steak at that point and was just ready to go home.  Highlight of the meal was the service, which was excellent.  Our waiter was very charming and was on top of our every need.  Also, the fried calamari appetizer was quite good.  Not chewy and overcooked like you get in most bigger chain joints.

I'm not talking a Ball cap or a lame fedora from target. I'm talking a VERY nice, custom, hand made beaver felt hat. I can understand having a no ball cap policy, but you're in Austin, Tx. When the second employee at the top of the stairs asks me to remove my hat, my fianc√© got involved and as he replies to her he grabs her arm (do not touch a patron). So here is the kicker that really got us, we see 3 women wearing t shirts, 3 men wearing shorts and one of these guys was wearing sandals. CMON!!!! If you're gonna have a dress code let's class it up a bit. If it would have been mine or my finances bday we would have gotten up and walked out. So the remainder of our experience there was ruined, not to mention the hair in our food (we understand mistakes happen). I highly suggest they change this dress code.

However the email was unanswered and the voice message and phone call was not returned. She asked if the bill was paid and when I advised her that it was she just said okay.

Only 8-9 people arrived sporadically after the booked time and less then the booked amount. Zero entrees and only 3 Orders of appetizers over a 3 hour span were ordered. No booking fees charged and minimal amount spend never met to utilize the space for that time frame. I am open to talking to you about you experience.

As a business owner yourself i would hope you can see the delicate balance that has to be preserved in order to have a successful planned event. Thank you for your feedback, Vivian Williams\\n\\nHence her ignorance in her response above.

And honestly, Highland Kitchen has earned my four stars. First off, it has a fun (if busy and crowded) but very pubby atmosphere. Its staff is very efficient, friendly, and generally enjoyable to be around, especially considering that crowded factor. The bartenders are fast and helpful, and keep an eye on you if you're looking for seating at the bar and the like. And there's the food, which is beyond good for what it is. \\n\\nSee, here's the thing. i just wrote about one burger and fry combo that didn't quite (quite) hold up to my good old-fashioned, meaty Midwestern expectations (though it came close). Their burger, for which you can select one of several cheeses and comes with grilled onions on the side (big plus) comes closer. It's a good burger, and it came cooked as requested. Besides that, we also shared a bowl of gumbo. Even though the bowl doesn't look huge, it will more than fill you up, and it's seriously good. We've also tried the chili, and the same goes. Their flavors of traditional foods are delicious and hearty, but also a little spicy and more interesting than one might expect. I also am a big fan of the whole Brussels sprouts craze (which seems to be fading in favor of the beet salad, but whatever), and we had to try their Buffalo Brussels sprouts. Yup, those were deep-fried and spicy and came with bleu cheesy sauce. They were almost too much, but ended up being flat out awesome. \\n\\nAlso, their drinks are very good, and more inventive than some pubby drinks might be. They use interesting combinations of things, including some St. Germaine-y cocktails that are delightful. And their beer list is pretty great, too, and all of it is decently priced.\\n\\nThere is one problem with Highland Kitchen, which is also, unfortunately, one of its attributes. It is small and always bustling. But this also means that anytime after 6 or 7 on a weeknight, and worse as you approach 8 and after, there will likely be a wait. That wait will be shorter if you can find a spot at the bar or if you're just with one other person, but there will likely still be one. So go on a night when you do want a drink before dinner, and look at the crazy jukebox, and enjoy it."},{"name":"Poompui Thai Food","address":"SW 4th Ave And Hall St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Portland!

We had a reservation for 6:30 but arrived a little early.  The restaurant was pretty empty but filled up by the time we left.  The bruschetta and bread that was brought at the beginning of the meal was delicious.  I had the house salad and my dining companion had the caesar.  Both were good but I think I liked the house salad better (although it did have too much dressing).  For entrees, I had the eggplant parmesan and my companion had the chicken parmesan.  Both were delicious!  Dessert was a cannoli and the chocolate cake- again, very good.  Overall, I would give the food 4 stars.  As some have commented, the service can be a little lacking.  Our waiter was very nice but we did wait a little longer than I would've liked for our food and for him to come by and box up our leftovers.

We arrived a bit late for our 8:00 reservation but everyone was delighted to see us. I like the space and unique decor a lot, the feel is definitely intimate and cozy. I would, however, welcome the addition of small candles on the table to add a little bit of warm light throughout the room. There were about 6 other tables seated that evening and the noise level was very low. I love the fact that Little Bacch shares the wine list with its big sister restaurant upstairs. We started with a half bottle of French chardonnay which went well with the oysters and the snapper crudo. Both were delicious and well balanced. I also appreciated that the bread was served warm. It always amazes me how many up-scale restaurants don't do this. Next we shared the shrimp cocktail and the salad for two. The shrimp was served in a massive, cooled soapstone bowl and while this was a unique touch, as was the composition of the cocktail, it turned the ingredients too cold which reduced the subtle flavors. The salad for two was good, very fresh and clean flavors that could, however, have benefited from a bit more seasoning, like the addition of a touch of tarragon or something equally distinctive. The addition of a small pepper grinder and a small dish of sea salt After I had ordered a bottle of the Calera Pinot Noir from California, the sommelier from upstairs came down to suggest a Burgundy. It was nice that he recalled my visit to Bacchanalia about 2 1/2 months ago and that the french Pinot that he suggested was actually 18 dollars less (at $72) than the Calera which was no longer available. While I generally stay away from red Burgundies because I often find them too acidic, this one was lush and smooth, very similar to the Calera Pinot. The wine glasses at little Bacch are of a more casual, stemless style, however, upon my request, the server was nice enough to run upstairs and fetch us a pair of proper Burgundy glasses. We concluded our meal with the escargot and the country pork terrine. Both were hardy and very tasty, although the snail shells were massive compared to their content. Well, at least the flavor if not the size of the snails matched! I often try a grouping of smaller courses on my first visit to a restaurant to check out the range. Although the menu is indeed small, it certainly offers a lot of variety and might change more frequently than one would find at other restaurants. Since I tend to check out a restaurant's menu online before dining there, the small menu wasn't a surprise and I look forward to trying some of the entrees next time around, as well as a cocktail. I have to say that the service was excellent and very attentive. I like everyone who came to our table, our waiter, the sommelier from upstairs, two servers bringing the dishes to the table and clueing them as well as the chef who came by at the end of our meal to see how we liked the food.

But this time, not so much.\\n\\nWe got the shrimp and fish filet congee (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Q4u7W5grwSKZy-suUKhtqw?select=5iP9GJvF9TfGba76Ae9bQg), bbq pork & soya chicken on rice (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Q4u7W5grwSKZy-suUKhtqw?select=bWVxpTKnTbyE0ApH1en0-g), and Shanghai-style braised chicken noodle soup (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Q4u7W5grwSKZy-suUKhtqw?select=lD5FVuvdbLj6PgjUXWVEXQ). The congee base was just ok. (It's great compared to SF standards but I've had better elsewhere in Vancouver.) There were tons of shrimp and fish but the shrimp was flavourless and didn't have that crunchy-softness - definitely not fresh. The bbq pork and soya chicken were both flavourful and tender. That dish wasn't amazing, but was still very satisfying. The braised chicken noodle soup had a milk-based broth. While it wasn't very authentic, the soup was still pretty tasty - really creamy and reminded me of Cantonese-style cream soups. The noodles were overcooked though.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the peanut butter & condensed milk toast (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Q4u7W5grwSKZy-suUKhtqw?select=pOWxxiRo9jJEkOkAKzkBoQ) and black sesame paste (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Q4u7W5grwSKZy-suUKhtqw?select=RxIRLJEBS0-k_laYpwJbXQ). The bread was toasted nicely and was loaded with peanut butter, but not quite enough condensed milk. The black sesame paste was a total fail though - lumpy, lacked black sesame flavour, and clearly made from a powder mix.\\n\\nService is what you'd expect from a typical Chinese restaurant - fast and efficient but not super friendly. Their huge menu can be a little overwhelming. I gotta commend them on their very helpful website though; it's got some pictures and a full menu - in both Chinese and English!"},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"First time was really good, the second was good, and the third was average and expensive.

I was informed there is a $7 minimum for credit cards and was quickly presented with a gift card which would be charged $7 and carry the balance of $1.40 +/-.

I love hot pot, and I often enjoy it in the summer as well.  However, most people are less than willing to join me, so I usually resort to personal sized hot pots.  One of our favourite hot pot places in Richmond is Claypot Hotpot on Alexandra.\\n\\nHot pot here is all-you-can-eat, at $19 per person.  Soup bases, like most places, are separate though and range from $7 to $10 per table.  We stuck to the parsley and century old egg due to my family's aversion to spicy.  Not my favourite, but I can deal with it.\\n\\nThe endless amount of nicely marbled beef is always a delight. I typically dump a lot into the pot to boil for a few seconds, whereas at home, I cook them slice by slice.  It's more efficient this way when it's unlimited beef.\\n\\nAnother great thing about AYCE hot pot is the small portions of large varieties of vegetables.  Leafy greens were served in tiny wok-like bowls.  I was pleased that the veggies, including shungiku, watercress, and Chinese lettuce, were quite fresh.\\n\\nThe first time around I ordered many more pieces of the stuff on the leftmost dish compared to what actually came.  Seven pieces of kabocha squash amounted to only two and same for the taro.  That was a bit frustrating.  The oysters though, were quite large and fresh.  Size is something that I find to vary wildly though, so be warned.  The various dumplings and wontons were (not surprisingly) of the frozen variety.\\n\\nThe second time around, although we were already getting a bit full, I ordered a few more pieces of the stuff that was short the first time.  They gave us way more than I had ordered.  I hate it when that happens.  Food-wise, the taro here is always a winner since it's pre-fried and will cook until it's soft.  I also love the squash (yay carbs!), but I found the corn here to be pretty bad.  I also tried ordering just enoki mushrooms but they gave the \\"assorted mushrooms\\" as per the menu.\\n\\nThe deep fried fish skin was not as good as Fatty Cow's since they were a tad thicker, but nonetheless had a good crunch to them.  I also really like the lamb shoulder slices which are quite a bit thinner than the beef slices.  I also love vermicelli and glass noodles (which are thicker) since they soak up quite a bit of the soup.\\n\\nAside from the discrepancies in the amount of food ordered and given, I still find meals at Claypot to be a treat.  Endless beef slices are just amazing."},{"name":"Atasca","address":"50 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I walked into Astaca Hampshire completely alone and with no experience in the realm of Portuguese cuisine. I traipsed in with my massive backpack and a very nice woman immediately came to me, ushering me into a nice cozy corner of the restaurant. There was pleasant music and the lighting complimented the ambiance with a comfortable haze of reddish glow. The waiter, in his equally warm Portuguese accent, greeted me and told me the specials. I told him that this was my first experience at a Portuguese restaurant and he immediately helped me out with a few options. I ended up choosing the Arroz de Marisco.\\n  It's basically a huge pile of traditional Portuguese rice cooked in a delicious tomato-based sauce and smothered in various types of shellfish and squid. Before I could stop myself, I ate the chunks of seafood before really digging into the rice portion of the meal. The mussels and clams were tender, the squid wasn't overly chewy, and the overall seafood essence laced in the sauce seemed to authenticate the entire experience for me. Despite a good baseline to compare this restaurant, I firmly believe that this is food is very traditional and untouched by the bland influences of America.

This is heaven reincarnated as food!! The steak is always seasoned & cooked perfectly, and the mouth watering corn cake that it comes on top of, I could probably eat five of them. You smear it with the incredible honey-jalape√±o butter that it comes with, and immediately realize that life is good.\\n\\nOne other thing that is very important: If you decide order the sweet biscuits, which you should, you should definitely get two orders.

If you are there solo, you could get away with one order, but I could honestly eat two myself.\\n\\nPretty much everything you order here is a home run in my opinion, except for the mac and cheese. I didn't really think it was that good, but everything else was so *Tasty that they still get 5 stars from me.\\n\\nNow there are a couple of things you need to know about this restaurant. First of all, don't ever go on a weekend, unless you have plenty of time and are ok with waiting. There will ALWAYS be a wait on the weekends, and the workers are busting their tail the entire time, so cut them some slack. I prefer to go on weekdays myself, to avoid all that nonsense, and usually get in within the first five minutes. It most likely will still be a packed house even on the weekdays, with quite a bit of noise, but nothing as crazy as the weekends.\\n\\nAnother thing to be aware of, the food comes out when it is done, piece by piece. Things come out one at a time and it is more of a family style restaurant, so it is all the more reason to get a few orders of the sweet biscuits. You'll thank me later.\\n\\nOne last thing I like to do here, now that I've been coming for awhile, is figure out what I want to eat before hand, by looking at the Yelp pictures. They are very accurate. It saves a ton of time here if you know what you want when you are getting your waters, just because there is so much going on.\\n\\nFinal thought: Eat here, but make sure you have plenty of time to soak in the whole experience."},{"name":"Milwaukie Cafe And Bottle Shop","address":"9401 SE 32nd Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice legit neighborhood brunchy breakfast place.

Someone from corporate needs to be made aware of the situation. They are the slowest. I have never seen anything like this and it's disappointing to say the least. I have been coming to this location for years, but this will be the last time. Even mobile ordering is slow. My daughter was late for school because the cashier couldn't find the order. I gave the order number and nothing could be located. Instead of alerting a manager immediately, the cashier left me to take another order, waited a bit, sent some food out then alerted the manager. The manger came up and found the order and started packing it up for me. The manager has a team for a reason so while she handled it...there was no urgency because the cashier never alerted her. So, there was no apology or anything. They rarely say my pleasure. And I can't tell you the number of times that I have had to pull up and wait some more after sitting in the drive thru for 15+ minutes on a good day. This is a single line drive thru location and heaven forbid if they ever decide to expand to two lanes. It's not just today, it's every single visit. Inside line, drive thru, mobile order...be prepared to wait. The customer service is lacking and this place is not up to the chick-fil-a standard! I hate to say it, but I never receive this type of service on the north side of Altanta. Come on now, we can do better than this.

You'll get a kick out of the large portraits of the Swifts.\\nThe Asian influenced happy hour menu was a nice break from the typical modern-American menus. Service was pleasant and quick in the early evening.\\nOur meal and comments, in order of arrival: \\nSun Salad - Very light on the dressing which allowed more of the delicate sunflower seed and sprout flavors to come through \\nNouc Cham Brussel Sprouts - This is the best version in town! I thought Uchiko did it well, but Swift's balances the sweet, sour, and bitter perfectly. The sprouts were evenly roasted so that the core is not hard and the leaves were not chewy. Not greasy or syrupy sweet.\\nSmoked Eggplant Bao - Awesome roasted flavor. The eggplant filling makes you not miss the typical pork filling for a bao. The toasting of the bun is a nice touch, because a plain steamed bun can sometimes get gummy when chewed.\\nSwift's Karaage - Panko fried chicken and battered oyster mushrooms. Tasty dark meat chicken with a nice, cripsy crust. The vinegary plum-like sauce balanced the fried flavor well.\\nCharred Edamame - We didn't read the detail for the dish and were surprised when a condiment that we dipped the edamame started popping in our mouth - pop rocks. Not sure if it really enhanced the already good grilled flavor, but it made it the experience interesting.\\nWe finished with a sweet potato based dessert topped with a small scoop of coffee ice cream.

If you want a burger with taste, you need to shell out $8+ per burger to add a bunch of toppings. There is always the sauce bar, but really if you have to add sauce to your meat, you shouldn't bother eating it.\\nTheir fries are the skinny fries, so you have to eat 3 or 4 at a time to make up 1 normal cut fry. Skinny fries are really great if you are using them as a mechanism to eat as much ketchup as you can, since their is more surface area per fry to coat. But, otherwise, they aren't OMG wow fries.

I am DONE with Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a Oreo cheesecake for a colleague's birthday with her name written on top. You have to pay extra for the name to be written on a special card to place on the cake. \\n\\nUpon picking up the cake from CF, the girl proceeded to tell us that they do not have anymore cards, and the name was not written on the cake for that reason. She was not apologetic by any means. She actually looked annoyed. How could you be annoyed? You're not the one that has to give a birthday cake to someone without their name on it. Personalizing a birthday cake is how people feel special on their birthday. This is a very important part, not to mention the fact that we are spending OVER $50 for this cake! Why didn't anyone call us!? Why is the girl behind the counter having an attitude? \\n\\nFinally the manager comes over, his name was Patrick. He was very nice and at least tried. He wrote the name on the cake. It was not the prettiest but he tried. I gave one star bc he tried. In the future, do not have an attitude with the customer, it isn't their fault that your inventory is not correct and we were not notified. Also if you're going to work in the bakery, and have an attitude, maybe you should work in the back. Bake the cookies, rather eat a cookie and have a smile! She needs a new job. She is lucky she didn't have her name tag on! Patrick thanks for trying... but after $50 that is ridiculous! To others just go to Publix and buy a cake.

I will post here the letter I wrote to the owner to which I never heard a reply, granted it was shortly after they first opened but ya know, if you are not ready then don't open!  This place is a total rip off and it makes me mad they get a good write up as well as good yelp reviews, totally discredits reality!!  from May 29, 2015.  I had to send this to their other restaurant as they didn't even have a mailbox set up for this dump.  \\nMr. Wolmark, \\n\\nI want to have a \\"come to Abraham\\" talk with you about your new restaurant Izzy and Mo's.  I have worked in the restaurant business for over thirty years and dining out I would consider a hobby.  You have to provide a balance of quality, quantity and value in order to succeed, along with ample parking.  A friend and I ate lunch at the restaurant this week.  I was looking forward to lunch as I had seen a write up of offerings.  We arrived and found the sparseness/primitiveness of the place rather shocking but easily overlooked as to the promise of a good lunch.  Menu review, need descriptions for everything, what's in your chicken salad? What was the daily blintz. I think the general Midwest population does not know what a knish is or a blintz. Use a chalk board! For lunch, I had the boring corned beef sandwich and a glass of herbal tea-$17.20!!! Perhaps you try and justify the cost by printing \\"grass fed\\" and \\"organic marbled rye\\"  but truth be told, I could care less about that and it sure did not make the product taste any more than generic corned beef and simple store bought rye.  The coleslaw was bland, simply tasteless and the Russian dressing-?  There was a smear of pink something that provided no enhancement at all.  The pickled radishes were a nice alternative to the ubiquitous pickle.  The tea was ok, but there was no sweetener available other than the simple syrup, also, I did not feel that there were refills offered and at $3.00, that's ridiculous. You had no diet drinks available, only the cola and root beer, so the only alternative for that was unsweetened herbal tea?  The open carafes of water on the tables outside, doesn't bother me but the health department is going to ding you on that. We would have maybe gotten a couple of the very few baked goods displayed to go but since we had already spent an exuberant amount on a sandwich and drink, we did not feel the need to spend anymore money.  As we ate lunch, we compared what a fabulous lunch we could have had for the same, if not less money than we spent at your place.  For example, I could have eaten at the Brown Bag deli in German Village ( I lived for a time across the street from them and ate there often) and had a huge, tasty sandwich, a side of their smoked potato salad, two deviled eggs and a drink for less than what I paid at your place.  We could have gone to the Katzinger's deli also in German Village where the joke is you have to take out a second mortgage to eat there but in reality, their sandwiches are comparable in price, larger offering, refills on certain items and all the pickles you can eat.  We could have had a really nice lunch at Lindy's or had a lovely buffet at Aab Indian, I could really go on and on.  You need to go to Brown Bag and Katzinger's to get an idea of what you can do to make it because your offerings now, not going to happen. You are located in the campus area and students are not going to pay your prices for what it is.  We will not back and what you also succeeded in doing because of this initial experience with Izzy and Mo's is we will not bother to try Till Dynamic Fare.  Parking is also going to be an issue for you. While I found parking a block away, come bad weather or winter you would be last place considered to eat at.  The nice looking gentleman behind the counter needs to take it down a notch, I place the order and he yells \\"order in\\" while the cook is standing right next to him!  He then comes out the door with the food as we are on the patio and yells our ticket numbers..we are the only two people on the patio!  Really!  \\n\\nWhile there are a couple of good reviews on Yelp there are also some bad ones and you need to use this tool to help you because it is everyday people like myself telling you how it is.  I chose to give you a review personally rather than post it on Yelp though take a look, there are similar observations posted.\\n\\nThank you for your time, best of luck to you."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So, I had Salt & Straw bookmarked LONG before it made its way to LA where I was able to try for the first time, so it was only right that I visit Salt & Straw in Portland too.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came mid afternoon and was pleased to find that the lines weren't crazy long.

It is tight so be prepared for your conversation to be overheard if you're going during peak hours.  Decor is nicely done. Simple, classy, not pretentious. Check! Been here twice so far. Tried the spicy beef noodle soup, pawn and crabmeat soup noodles, and papaya salad. \\n\\nSpicy beef noodle soup is tasty. Tasted like a mix of Vietnamese beef noodle soup with dried shrimp and spicy prawn paste. First of its kind in Vancouver I must say and for a moment, my taste buds were confused -was I having Vietnamese beef soup or Malaysian style prawn noodle soup (which is spicy and uses a lot of prawn paste) or 2-in-1? If I don't overthink it, it is quite tasty. Flavour is balanced and I like the fresh basil and bean sprouts. Noodle is of the rounded kind unlike the traditional flat'ish pho noodle. Still as tasty. Perfect on a cold day. \\n\\nPapaya salad came with what seem like a sweet soya sauce as its dressing. Papaya salad also had dried meat jerky shreds sprinkled at the top which was quite unique.  Added some chewiness to the salad. Like Thai papaya salad, ingredients were very similar. Salad had peanuts as well. It was flavourful but I actually prefer the Thai dressing better than this one. Though it was light, I enjoy the sourness of the Thai dressing better than this savoury style salad. \\n\\nI found the crabmeat and prawn noodle soup rather bland. It had a lot of coconut in the soup and the broth came out opaque. Didn't have the complex combination of flavours the spicy beef noodle soup had. I wouldn't order this one again.

I cannot tell a lie I was highly disappointed in the guacamole. It had no flavor to it. I had to wait forever for our server to show up so I could ask her for salt, pepper, and lime to doctor up this smushed avocado and red onions. I took some cilantro from my shrimp taco to add to the guac as well. \\nThe salsa was pretty good. I would suggest a little more heat n cilantro to both the guac and the salsa. As for the queso, it was the best amigo in this trio. \\nThe chips were fresh and crispy! \\nThe Mexican street corn came in its own side plate. Great presentation, loved that they chose to keep husk on as it gives you that true fair feel. This dish was flavored well. And the lime is not a garnish folks! Use it, it will make the flavor pop on this item! \\nEntrees included:\\nBraised brisket- this taco was fun. It tastes of a beautiful pot roast hot out of the oven. The pickled veggies on top gave a nice sneaky heat/spice. Word of advice, beware of the excessive broth...it will saturate your other tacos. \\nPork belly- this came with a very tasty sauce, grilled corn kernels and crispy chunks of pork belly. This was my favorite of them all. \\nShrimp taco- well my shrimp was burned. It was literally charred to the point that it tasted bitter. I love shrimp...but my heart sank with this one. \\nBeef taco- I decided not to order this as my thought was, if you've had one beef taco, you've had them all. Well not in this case. My friend decided to go for it and was highly disappointed. This taco lacked character. It was simply seasoned ground beef with an excessive amount of Cotija cheese. The taco was just salty. No garnish at all. \\nOh well. No love lost for me. They received three stars because some things were pretty good, however, there's always room for improvements.

The curry was loaded with wilted onions and carrots with only 3 potato pieces (I love potatoes) and had that funny aroma to it while being very flavourless at the same time; since it was neither spicy or salty. It seemed like the curry was suffering from an identity crisis and is puzzled as to what it should taste like. It became a huge chore to finish the painfully plentiful portion and I grew bored.

Great food, indifferent service.  Hostess was decidedly unenthused and more concerned with pushing drinks on us while we waited for our table and then going on her break.  She also asked us two very curious questions, the first being 'Ready?' when she wanted to take us to our table - isn't it usually the hostess's job to tell us the table is ready rather than ask us if we are?  We were obviously ready as we had been waiting 20 minutes with our drinks already.  And once we were seated she asked us if we had enough settings.  Again, correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it was the restaurant's responsibility to ensure that things like that were ok rather than to ask the diners to verify.  Our server took my order by scribbling down the items, but not offering any confirmation that she had heard each dish except for the first 'ok'.  I had to look at her for a couple of seconds after I ordered my second dish before she finally acknowledged it.  And without confirming all the items with me again, she got one of the dishes wrong.  Highlights of the dinner were the Pan-fried Potatoes (probably the best value on the menu and indeed tasty with those amazing lardons), Hush Puppies, Choucroute Royale, Fish Board, Spaghettini Carbonara and Pan-fried Flounder Burger.

Im not a big sausage guy so this was a gamble. I bit into a sweet sausage with a fine smokiness that went right up my nose. Win. Esp with a bit of chili sauce.\\n\\nNext came the congee, crispy wontons and scallions atop a creamy white soup, congee is another first for me. It looks like tapioca, and tastes like egg drop soup with the texture of grits. The lady says im \\"very adventurous\\" to try preserved egg and she explains why, tho its not as salty as she makes it out to be. In fact im not sure how much egg is really in it. I taste more of the white soup than anything else but its not bad, if you were expecting oatmeal. Still, this bowl is a bit large for one guy even with my appetite! Ask for an extra side of crispy wontons to make it more dynamic. \\n\\nThe sticky rice is here and i realize tea isnt enough to wash down whats become a very sticky meal all around so i ask for water which prob comes from the flouridated tap like every other restaurant. \\n\\nThe rice is perfectly sticky, and heavily influenced by the blanketing leaves which quickly conquer my small plate. Its filled with pork and sausage ends, i discard those as they look like cheap breakfast sausage not the Chinese spicy. The menu didnt warn me about the filling and suddenly i realize my whole meal is made of two things: pork, and sticky.

Maybe some people only feel like they're really eating out if they get treated as an afterthought by the wait staff, but not me.\\n\\nWe were there by 6:30, place was noisy but mostly people at the bar and a private party in one of the rooms (who were only drinking, not eating).  It was probably 10-15 minutes before our waiter even showed up, and he didn't even really ask if we wanted to start with drinks or an appetizer.  Just sort of stood there, so we ordered everything at once.  I'd say 10-15 minutes later, appetizers and drinks came at the same time.  Okay, the salad with goat cheese I will admit was good (although not something I would go out of my way for) and they do mix a good sidecar.\\n\\nDuring all this, though, our waiter--who seemed either quite harried or maybe just hapless--came back and said sorry, you ordered 3 scallops and only 2 are left.  Okay, it happens, although given that at this point it was still pretty early in the evening, it was a little surprising.  No matter, we ordered a substitution.\\n\\nA few minutes later, back he came: oh, we're out of the bluefish and two other dishes (I wasn't paying much attention since luckily my order wasn't affected).  But to be out of so many dishes already?\\n\\nAnyway, it was then probably 25-30 minutes between the appetizers and the entrees, and while our water glasses kept getting refilled, Mr. Hapless never came by to ask if anybody wanted more drinks.  Which we did.  And don't restaurants make an insane profit on drinks?\\n\\nFinally, after the entrees came, another drink order was taken.  I had the duck confit, and I could have *sworn* the menu also said something about sausage, but I don't think there was any around... oh well.  So my entree, I'd say, was good enough but at that point I was annoyed enough with the service that I didn't really enjoy it.\\n\\nSo I might go back there for a drink sometime, but I think I'll avoid it for dinner.

When I'm in Portland again this is where you'll find me. No other restaurant in my many years of dining brought me to the level that Beast did. With Six individual courses paired with six glasses of wine, it can only be described as epic! The way the menu was put together I didn't feel overly stuffed at the end.... I just had an incredibly satisfied smile on my face. \\n\\nIt's rare nowadays that I'll treat myself to a meal at this level. While on vacation though it's no holds barred. \\n\\nThe restaurant is small and adorable... she sits nestled between two buildings waiting patiently for the two seatings a night. There are two communal tables, and an open kitchen where you can see every ingredient carefully being placed on each plate. The walls, almost like one big chalkboard, are adorned with scribbled quotations and drawings. My favorite quote I read... \\"Vegetables are interesting but lack a sense of purpose when unaccompanied by a good cut of meat\\" \\n\\nWe sat at the smaller of the two communal tables that sat eight, the other holding 18. We met a great couple from the city and talked food the entire night. You could feel the anticipation of what was to come from everyone in the restaurant. \\n\\nHighlights of the evening: (because I'm not about to break down a six course meal) \\n\\nFoie-Gras Bon-Bon was impressive... earthy and smooth, but still packed an explosion of flavor in your mouth \\n\\nSteak Tartare & Quail Egg Toast: Some of the better Tartare I've had... when you get the raw quail egg though, and the way it bursts and percolates on your tongue wrapping itself around the tartare.... wow, it was heavenly! \\n\\nChicken Liver Mousse: \\"Mom... I ate chicken liver, and I'm in love. Be proud of me - Love, Your son\\" \\n\\nThe Duck from Sonoma Farms was the best duck breast I've ever had. Seared but still cooked perfectly, served with Sauteed local Zucchini tossed in Basil and Pine nuts.... Words can't describe... so they won't try. \\n\\nThe meal culminated with a Coffee Creme Brulee served with the most marvelous hand full of Cherries I've ever had. Fresh food like this should be outlawed if not available to everyone! I'm not used to these kinds of ingredients and the availability locally so each bite brought me closer to never wanting to leave the city. \\n\\nThe Chef as a parting gift provided Honey Maple Bacon dipped in Chocolate... since Bacon makes everything better it was a wonderful way to end the evening. \\n\\nAll in All I'd have to say it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Somethings brewing in Portland and if you haven't been you're missing out. Set a date, make a reservation, and arrive with a passion for great food, an appetite for destruction, and an open mind...

Ordered two of the Bad Ass Sandwich, one with bacon and the other with sausage, and the Not So Dismal.  I had the Bad Ass Sandwich and I was disappointed.  The sandwich is served between two thick slices of white toast.  That's cute, Toast serving toast.  It was so dry and the bread cut my mouth a little.  I ended up deconstructing my sandwich to make it palatable.  The sausage wasn't very flavorful and I was questioning if they forgot the goat milk cheese because I was expecting a tangy flavor.  Some acid or that tang was needed to break up the heaviness of all the components.  Overall, dry and needed some kind of sauce because the egg yolk was not enough moisture.  Potato Rosti was the opposite, oily and soggy.  \\n\\nI was talking to a co-worker about it and he commented \\"there is something off about it.\\"  I agree, the atmosphere and food wasn't quite there for me.

The fish fillet inside was thin and tiny. The fish tasted like cardboard. I do not recommend these! \\n\\nThe gordita was an improvement. It looked like a large waffle covered with pork and sauce. It could serve as a light lunch. \\n\\nService was awkward. When we got in no one was around, then a young guy yelled to sit wherever we want from across the room, as another server was seated eating lunch. It felt like an inconvenience to dine in. It would be nice to start with a better first impression like walking over to guests and greeting them face to face with a warm tone. The food took a while.

The menu, the patio, and the prices would lead you to believe that it's an upscale taco joint with food to match. Sadly that is not the case. First the good: they have a nice patio but they don't make much effort to clean the tables of leaves and other fallen debris. Their salsa is good but the chips are weirdly thick and greasy. The sweet tea is strong and sweet but has a strange aftertaste. My fiance and I ordered 3 tacos each: he had the tongue, the pork shoulder, and the brisket. The tongue was pretty tasty; I'd give it a 4 out of 5. The vegetables on the brisket were great but they couldn't compensate for the lackluster taste and texture of the brisket. The pork shoulder had picked carrots on it; the carrots by themselves were pretty alright but they clashed with the pork. I ordered the chicken hearts, the shrimp, and the skirt steak. The shrimp was alright; I enjoyed the guacamole on it more than the measly portion of shrimp. The skirt steak arrived in a puddle of grease and I wound up having it stricken from our bill because it was inedible. The hearts...I don't know if they were cooked poorly or if it was just me but they were incredibly off-putting and the taco was overstuffed with them. Overall it was a deeply unsatisfying lunch; if you're looking for a good taco you'd have much better luck at taqueria del sol, la perla, or Tijuana garage."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love this place, from the name to the menu and decor.

I think I saw on the way out, that the Corned Beef in the case was Boston Brisket Company. I don't know if the pastrami comes from there too. The corned beef was precooked and in cryovac. I know we got our corned beef from the now defunct American Kosher which we got uncooked in big barrels and cooked ourselves. We used the Pearl Provisions black pastrami and had a trick of adding sugar when we heated it. I am guessing there is not much choice in the Boston area anymore as kosher meat companies and delis have really struggled over the last 20 years. I know that in Albany, NY, Old World Provisions makes very good tasting corned beef.  \\nI asked for the hot fatty corned beef and it was very tough and chewy. Fatty usually melts in your mouth. My daughter got the Nova plate and they were very generous with the Nova and I tasted a small piece and it was delicious.

I'm a simple man, as you can tell by my simple tastes.\\n\\nAaanyway, 49th Parallel now has two of those covered, in the form of their newer  location (okay it's no longer new) and major rebranding on Main Street with Lucky's Donuts.  It's possibly more hipster than even this most hipster-est of neighborhoods both inside and out, but is that always such a bad thing?  As long as the food and service is good, it's all good.

It's fairly roasty without being too sour or bitter like some other places.

They make a pretty mean Americano, too, which is about the extent of my fancy coffee-drinking ways. Like I said, I like it simple.\\n\\nBut really, the coffee is not why I go here.  It's the donuts.  Maybe donuts should be higher on my priority than coffee?  It's hard to say.  While I generally question the concept of 'artisinal donuts', these are really darn good.  And they're interesting without being TOO off-the-wall with their flavor choices.

Last time I got a lemon-filled sugary one that almost spilled its contents all over me but it was too delicious for me to care.\\n\\nAnd that's what's important, deliciousness.  49th Parallel/Lucky's Donuts delivers in that aspect, and thus earns my enthusiastic thumbs-up."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been to the Brookline location before so when my girlfriend and I decided to go out for breakfast at lunch time on a Saturday, I thought this would be a good choice.

They only have a couple places to sit at the shop if you choose to dine in and it was super hot in there. 2. The free water cups are hilariously tiny. 3. A whole pie can be a bit pricey, which is why we visited the shop in person to get some slices as a taste test.\\n\\nThe good things far outweigh the bad though! Had the jerk chicken and pesto pizza (by the slice, reheated in the oven by staff) and OMG it was amazing! If you don't try a specialty slice or pie and settle for plain ol' pepperoni you are really missing out folks. \\n\\nThe greek salad was very fresh with plenty of feta and olives along with nice crispy greens. The balsamic vinegarette dressing tasted like it was made fresh that day. Upon inquiry I was told that all the salad dressing is hand made, nice! Sausage pizza was very good too but the flavor combo of the jerk chicken pesto was just so much more enjoyable. Not sure if kids would like it but adults, man, you gotta live a little and try the custom combinations. I will be back for more of the jerk chicken pizza.\\n\\nSaw a lot of folks coming in to grab slices to go. They wrap the slice in foil and will reheat it for you while you wait. I would recommend you reheat at home as the moisture will build up inside the foil or box and make it a bit soggy.\\n\\nAsked the staff and pretty much all of their dough and bread is made fresh each day. Did you know that Pizza Hut and others use frozen dough? No wonder they can't make a crust as good as this. Buy local and check this place out. Peppers and parmesan cheese packets are on your left as you exit, be sure to grab some.\\n\\nOn another occasion my friend brought home an entire pie and we reheated in the oven for a bit to make it crispy. It was amazingly good, we ate the whole thing LOL.\\n\\nStaff seemed pretty mellow and were definitely keeping it weird with tattoos, facial piercings, dyed hair, and other fashion things I would never personally do to my body.

I recently discovered Los Comales and am hooked.  The decor is small-town-Mexican-restaurant authentic; I felt like I could be in Falfurias or Sweetwater.  Bright colored cut-outs adorn the ceiling and there's even a pool table.  It's spacious and clean.  There's room for large parties.  My test for great Mex (not Tex-Mex) is the verde sauce, and Los Comales passes with flying colors.  The picquant tomatillo sauce, which I had with chicken enchiladas, was perfect.  Our server cheerfully tolerated our practicing some imperfect Spanish and even helped me with a word or two, never resorting to English. She re-filled my tea glass without my asking and, miralce of miracles, brought me a new lemon for the re-fill.  Even in the priciest places, they seem to not get it -- if you like lemon or lime with the first glass, then you like it with a refill.  My lunch companion got a combination plate of some kind and loved every bite. His came with a hard taco and the taco shell was home-made (!).  The salsa was delicious.  On another visit, I had fajitas and they were great too. I saw a caldo that I want to try next time.   Lunch specials filling and well under $10, with a drink.  I can't figure out Tabitha's negative review below, but maybe she just likes plastic chain food places (or just needs to go back to Dallas). Her nasty trashing of this nice place is unwarranted and the things she reports are not reflective of anything I experienced in two visits.

I asked for a unsweetened iced tea and was told that they only had sweetened (who doesn't have unsweetened iced tea?) I then ordered coffee which came out barely warm. We then ordered the Tile fish and a side of their grilled okra. It all came out not even as warm as my coffee. We sent it all back to be heated up. The server said they would be making a new order and not heating our current order. It came back out too quickly to be anything other than reheating our sent back meal. Although my fish tasted good my wife's was pink and looked undercooked. It was a thicker piece than mine. But this fish is not the type that you would want to eat undercooked like salmon or tuna. She sent hers back and they must have felt guilty since they decided to prepare her a new piece this time. It seemed like forever for her order to come out. I am a very slow eater and I was done before hers came out. When I asked for the check the server asked if we would like to order dessert, we declined and she said let me tell you about them since we would like to offer to comp you dessert for all your issues. Any other good restaurant would have had the manager over immediately offering apologies and at least offering to remake my wife's fish at their expense and probably would have if it as good a restaurant as people giving it 5 stars did.

In fact, it can be hard for non-pork eaters (or for that matter anyone who avoids certain foods for whatever reason)  to be able to dine here on a number of their weeks, as the menu is fixed for a week at a time.  Luckily, this week's menu had only a bit of pork and I was willing to miss a few specific items.  In fact, though I didn't ask, having read the website, they switched my soup base and I still got a delicious bowl of soup!\\nThe standout course, though all were nearly perfect, was an Iverian inspired braised lamb cheeks with finely cut braised carrots on a bed of romescu sauce (but made w hazelnut as opposed to the traditional almonds for extra amazing-ness) and some thin Spanish noodles. A nearly perfect dish-/ the lamb was finished in the oven with some lamb demi -glac√© that looked textbook perfect when ladled off the stove. \\nAll in all it was an amazing experience-- intimate, friendly, unbelievable food and wine but not pretentious or snobby.

Every plate returned to the kitchen clean. \\n\\nThe eclectic menu and small plate approach offered a variety of tastes for our party last night and pleased every palate. Each dish brought a new mini food adventure but our favorites of the evening were the duck wings - smoky deep flavor profile and the scallops, combined with a light sorbet -  the texture and flavors fused beautifully.\\n\\nBottom line?

Also an order of the 2 meat combo tacos of pork and brisket. We chose the beans and rice and fried yucca for the sides to that dish.\\n\\nThe hubs and I also asked for a couple recommendations on their IPA's. He likes something with a bit more bite while I'm still a newbie to beers and wanted something light and easy. The woman taking our order let us sample a couple different ones until we each found something we liked.\\n\\nAfter placing our order we wandered to a table outside as it was nice and cool. We noticed the restaurant was about half to two-thirds full. Pretty good for a Tuesday evening.\\n\\nThe seating area outside is nice considering it's right off a busy street. Great tunes from the seventies and eighties were playing which we enjoyed.\\n\\nOur beverages arrived a few minutes after we sat down and the food was only a couple minutes thereafter.\\n\\nHands down the ribs was the winning dish for us. A good dry rubbed rib with lots of meat. I usually find the St. Louis style rib to be more fatty than a baby back. These ribs felt like a bigger version of baby back ribs with less fat than I usually expect for St. Louis style. And the meat just pulled right off the bone. So good!!\\n\\nThe beef brisket was also very tasty and tender. The pork I thought was the only downer of the meal. It was very dry and a little tough. My husband commented that it tasted pretty good if you drowned it in one of the sauces that came with it. I like a little sauce, not a lot. If you have to cover it up with sauce then it's not that good to begin with.\\n\\nAll the sides were excellent. That was a very unexpected and pleasant discovery. Sides tend to get short shifted. However each one was well prepared with the best ingredients. I liked the fried yucca much more than I thought I would. It was lightly fried and not greasy at all. It was paired with a sauce that had a little kick to it. The grilled corn with it's lime, cilantro and sprinkling of cotija cheese will have you rethinking how to cook corn on the cob!! And I've never had beans and rice so flavorful. I didn't even know they could be so flavorful!! Usually that's something we take a couple bites and then leave it on the plate. We ate it all up though.\\n\\nWhat's great about this place is that we would bring our vegetarian friends here. All those sides would be great options for vegetarians. Plus there were more options that we didn't try and I'm sure they are just as good. \\n\\nCan't wait to return!!

But I just keep getting disappointed. \\n\\nPicture it, it was Boston 2017. It was a brisk fall night. A girl and her guy decided to bowl. \\n\\nWe get there and we were 2 ppl behind in line you would think this would move quickly. Nope stood in line for 17 mins. There were 4 ppl behind the counter but only one girl managing the register. We finally get to the front and guess what more waiting. They kept being distracted and just not getting it together. Then finally when we get serviced the experienced young lady had this other girl check us in and that took forever. \\n\\nGood deal though. Unlimited games for 10.99 if you're bowling it is 16 including shoe rental prices. \\n\\nSo we get to our lanes. My shoe laces keep untying, due to some knots they had in them. The pins kept getting stuck, our service was super slow. So half the time we waited around waiting on help. Funny thing is I thought it was a ploy to get ppl out of there. Get frustrated enough you will leave then you wont be taking up their lanes on unlimited games. Makes sense doesn't it. Anyway I ordered some sweet potato waffle fries covered in pulled pork. Oh yes that was good the only problem is we got it 45 min after I ordered it and it was partially cold. The place wasn't even that busy. But hey who knows maybe there was more going on then I could see. At the end we waited about 20mins just to pay our tab and that was after asking one of the staff if they could get us our check. We finally got up and walked to this bar to see if we can pay it there and then our server came. We got there bout 830 and didnt leave till about 1045. I would say 1:10 mins of that was spent waiting for them to either reset our game or waiting on other service. \\n\\nThis time my Kings trip was a bust. \\n\\nSo far my favorite one is Burlington.

Not to mention that i had a really rude response to my questions from the desk employee. I decided to go back to my car and call Hyatt Reservations..the woman assisting me from that side was excellent. She said she'd call and see if the manager would wave the fee.

After striking out at a Latin restaurant with a two-hour wait, we decided to try our alternate pick and rushed over to Accanto.  Walking in, the hostess asked if we had a reservation because there's going to be a wait and I thought to myself 'shit, strike two'...however, there were a few tables open so she checked with the manager and we were seated.  \\n\\nThe waiter had excellent serving skills from the moment that he greeted us.  He took our drink order after introducing himself.  They won me over for carrying 2 Town Ciderhouse!  We started out ordering the Antipasti (3 for $15): Deviled Eggs, Fried Oyster, and Foie Gras Butter.  He articulately told us the specials, which swayed my sister's from her initial pick on the menu--he had her at the Seared Scallops with blood orange on a bed of endives.  Her fiance got the Squid Ink Spaghetti, my other sister had the Smoked Half Chicken, and I am always sold on Lasagne.\\n\\nI was disappointed in the Antipasti plate.  The deviled eggs had too much horseradish in it because it had a kick at the end that masked the other flavors for me.  I have high expectations for Fried Oyster.  Since my visit to the Walrus and the Carpenter, it's forever ruined for me, because nowhere else seems to make it as good.  Personally, I am not a fan of Foie Gras--the taste is reminiscent of Monk Fish Liver and not palatable.  Pate is delicious, but I'll pass on the liver fat.  Had to order a side of bread and butter to cleanse my palate.  The main dishes made up for lack of impressive appetizers.  Larger portions than expected and that's always a plus.  The Lasagne was delicious, good flavors to the lamb meat that complimented the bitterness of the endives on top.  I had a bite of my sister's Smoked Half Chicken, what is that familiar spice I tasted--Chinese Five Spice or Star Anise??  It reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals.  My sister's fiance is picky when it comes to food and the fact that he enjoyed his dish says A LOT.  \\n\\nWe were considering heading to Pix for dessert when I remembered having their sensational Ricotta Doughnuts with the Lemon Curd at Feast Portland.

The other two chicken wraps were good, but both were just a bit too salty which I think is a product of soy sauce. The hummus was also very good! I was initially unsure about it being served warm, but it's clearly handmade and really nicely seasoned and now I think all hummus should past a temperature test. The bread it comes with was okay, but I wish it had been the bread that the wraps come on! I also so wish that the steak wrap that I've seen on some reviews had been available. I'm sure it would be fantastic.\\n\\nOne thing that really stood out to me was that each wrap was well constructed. I HATE when there is too much lettuce, or when a wrap is falling apart. It's a small thing that can be overlooked, but I think it's indicative of how much love and care goes into the food. Red Wraps shined here for me--perfectly lettuced and solid wrap build.

I've been here at all sorts of different hours - Sunday brunch time, Wednesday dinner time - and the wait has never been that long (maybe 10 minutes tops?). During \\"off hours\\" you can order off the menu, which I usually prefer to do so that the dimsum comes out piping hot (I hate it when they come off the carts luke warm!).  \\n\\nThe prices are reasonable (within dimsum standards).  I get the usual suspects here: shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, turnip cake, and shumai. I never really have much complaints.

When I saw him, I could tell he had been there for a LONG time. Bummer.  There's a quaint little bar across the street owned by the same people if you need a place to hang out and grab a drink during the wait. The place is typical of a down-home Italian restaurant with lots of large wooden tables and walls.  Service was also friendly and fast except for the hostess who seemed a bit cold and borderline mean.  \\n\\nWe finally sat down around 9 pm and had a fantastic meal. The homemade pasta was excellent, the sauces were great, and the portions were enormous. I like sauces on the heavier and stronger side so I really enjoyed the lobster ravioli which had large chunks of lobster in it. I was so excited to try one that the picture I took showed one ravioli missing and a happy me! Rino's special is not that appetizing to look at because it's just a monotonous brown but the 3 different types of meat were awesome! The braised pork with risotto was my favorite of the night. The pork literally fell off the bone and was super fatty and flavorful and the risotto was the best I've ever had. I thought the frutte di mari was good but not phenomenal like 2 of my friends thought but hey, everyone has different tastes.  We ended with 2 of their ice cream balls--cappuccino and truffle--which are basically large scoops of ice cream with a hard chocolate shell. What a great way to end an awesome feast!

Ah, the combination of hot and cold, sweet and salty, soft and crunchy is wonderful and very refreshing in summer.  Then I discovered the HU TIEU CHAY, a stir fry served with noodles instead of rice.  The noodles are amazing - flat noodles pressed into a cake and pan fried until they are crisp on the outside.

In terms of food, the pretzel is good. It's a better deal to get the large beer cheese for the pretzel than the small size. The baguette with butter is fresh and tasty. If you're a meat lover, I recommend the hot pastrami sandwich. Depending on your appetite, you can order the half or full version. When I'm in the mood for a sausage, I get the hatch chile chicken sausage.

It took me about 10 minutes to explain to the guy on the phone where I live (which is less than a mile away).  He couldn't figure it out.

Also, the toppings were good, but rather sparse.  There were a couple of slices with no broccoli on them at all, and there's not a lot of the other toppings, either.  The only difference between the Greek salad and the garden salad is the feta, which is a little off-putting, since they clearly have other vegetables they could use to make a more interesting garden salad.  And the cinna-balls are clearly just pizza dough rolled in cinnamon and sugar.  That means that they're too chewy, and there's a hint of salt in them.\\n\\nThe crust was good (all-natural), the sauce was good, and the cheese was good, but overall, I don't think what you get is worth the price.

They were served with a garlic sour creamish sauce, and they were perfectly crisp and delicious.\\n\\nMy tomato soup and grilled cheese was near-perfect. The grilled cheese was amazing; the cheeses, hint of caramelized onion, and excellent bread combined to create one of the best sammiches I've ever had (which is saying something). The tomato soup, while delicious, was topped with a basil cream sauce that I personally didn't love; however, it didn't take much from the overall combination. The boyfriend ordered the chopped salad, intrigued by the lardon (bacon-like) pieces, and he devoured it within minutes. Unfortunately, my unhappy stomach didn't permit us to try dessert.\\n\\nThe ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant was nice -- it wasn't overly hipster, and the wall and table d√©cor were all beautiful.
