The waiter came back and told us they were out of the gnocchi which we ordered 2, one for each of us for dinner. We decided on parapardelle instead. The grilled octopus was cold, pure rubber, and unappetizing. We couldn't even chew it. The lobster bisque soup was very good, that would be the only thing I recommend. The chicken papardelle was awful. The pasta was stuck together, the sauce tasted like something out of a can that was cold, and the chicken had no flavor.

I've been a loyalist at One Sushi since inception and continue to love it to this very day.  Katana on the other hand ...\\n\\nWe arrived 5 minutes before our 8:30pm reservation and were asked to wait at the bar until the space was available at the hibachi table.  We were happy to sit at the bar for a while and check out the scene until we ordered drinks and were promptly handed our bill in return for our order and told \\"when you're ready\\" ... before we even got our drinks!  Another couple sitting near us responded the same way we did when they were also handed their bill and told, \\"when you're ready\\" before the drinks came.  Well, I'm ready for my drink and I'm sorry but we aren't paying for anything until we have our drinks in hand and it's enjoyable especially when I'm told you're out of one of the main ingredients for my specialty cocktail (but promised it would still taste the same).  We waited nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks and our table still wasn't ready.  Our friends also ordered drinks and their order took so long they had to deliver them to the table about 15 minutes after we sat down.  Not exactly the best first impression!  \\n\\nAfter placing our orders, the food service seemed rushed but the drink orders continued to lag.  We had to place drink orders every time our server came around because it took at least 20 minutes for a drink to come.  The server forgot to deliver clean silverware so we asked the chef if he had a knife to cut our steak and was told that good quality steak doesn't need a knife.  Well this filet wasn't exactly cut in bite sized pieces and to avoid the embarrassment of eating like a caveman we kindly asked the chef again but he said we needed to see our server which was no where to be found.  We finally got our knives but the steak wasn't piping hot anymore. Disappointing. \\n\\nWe soon realized why the food service seemed rushed.  After approximately 35 minutes into our meal we were asked what we wanted from the bar for last call!  Needless to say, we were highly disappointed because we didn't even get seated until 30 minutes after our reservation.  When we went to order a dessert, we were told, \\"sorry we are no longer serving.\\"  I don't know many Buckhead restaurants that close their kitchen, more less their bar, at 10pm on a Saturday night!  Seems like a really bad business decision to me.  But on the other hand, they weren't exactly rushing the drinks to the table either...    \\n\\nThis is the second review I've ever written on yelp.  This place seems to be a hot spot with several affluent patrons (incl one of the Atlanta housewives that night) enjoying the ambiance, the food, and the experience.   I was incredibly disappointed with the service and the experience and quite frankly there are so many great dining options within a couple blocks of this place I'm not sure if I want to give it another chance.  More bar staff is needed so they don't seem so overwhelmed and drinks arrive timely. This would help patrons from getting frustrated when the bill arrives 15 minutes before the drinks do.  The food was pretty good but if you're seeking a later (8:30pm or later) dining experience to socialize with friends I would make reservations elsewhere so you don't feel rushed or like your inconveniencing the staff by being there."},{"name":"Black Creek Bistro","address":"51 Parsons Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is like a high end MCL cafeteria. \\n\\nThe duck gnocchi: dough balls with a weird, brown, soupy duck sauce.

They have valet parking which was nice especially since I would feel a bit nervous parking by myself and having to walk to the door. The whole place is surrounded by warehouse looking buildings and is very secluded which seems a bit sketchy. Inside, it's completely different however. The music is great and the vibe is very urban and hip. It is loud so if you're looking for a quiet dinner, this isn't the place for you. I had the lobster chip appetizer (if they still have it you MUST get it) and shared the steak with potatoes and chicken breast. Both were good but the chicken breast was by far the best of the two. I'm not sure what type of greens it came with but it was so tender and so juicy. I went with a large group so I didn't have much interaction with the servers except placing my order but I really didn't have many requests. They give you a large vase of water so I filled up my own glass which was nice. \\n\\nThe only complaint I would have is the wait time and area. Even though we had a reservation and all made it there on time, we still had to wait for about 20 minutes since our group was so large. There was no wait area so we stood awkwardly in between the tables and bars and had to rearrange ourselves everytime someone needed to pass by. We were also standing right next to people's tables which I know made them as uncomfortable as it made me.\\n\\nOverall it is a very trendy restaurant with good food and service that would be good for a group dinner.

Easy in the sense that the concept of it is simply flavorful broth and noodles.  Hard in the sense that it's difficult to get the depth of flavor and implement the right balance of noodle texture, condiment ratio, and broth consistency down to the point where it's enjoyable.  Traditionally, ramen shops in Japan, some of the purveyors and creators of this dish take years to master the craft of a good bowl of ramen.\\n\\nThat being said, Jinya is legit!!!\\n\\nI was craving ramen for a hot minute and was near the area and decided that this place was the best destination to satiate the fix.  And it's not ironic that I was watching a video of a food vlogger vlog about ramen places in NYC.\\n\\nUpon entering the place, there's a mixture of a ramen bar and traditional seating spaces.  The ambiance is of a dimly lit, quasi-Japanese feel to it.  The bowls are big but the flavors are bigger!  I order the Tonkatsu Black which is a pure pork broth based ramen dish.  The broth had a rich flavorful depth to it that was borderline bliss.  It definitely was rich which will sit heavy in your stomach but the flavor of it is the focus here people!\\n\\nThe noodles with this ramen is thin but there's a chewiness to the noodles that makes it work.  Plus, however they made the noodles, it was done in such a way that the noodles held onto the broth like whoa!  \\n\\nThe pork bits is literally a pot roast style meat because the meat dissolved!  Literally dissolved as I ate.  There wasn't a need to chew the meat.  That's how soft and tender it was!  And to add bliss to even more bliss, the egg was boiled enough to where it was hard boiled but the yolk was sily smooth and had a texture that only enriched the dish further.\\n\\nI also decided to order the added set which was an extra $4.50 on top of the 12.95 and with tip, dropped about $23 total.  Pretty expensive for ramen so that's the downside that one bowl of ramen with steam/fried dumplings would cost that much.  The additional set was the only downside to this.  The 4 dumplings were first steamed then pan fried on one side but they seemed like they were frozen, flash steamed, then pan fried as they came all stuck together and cooked at once.  The salad that was served with the set was a nice touch.  Although it was nothing more than spring mixed greens with a dressing of a garlic ginger mixture to it.  It was more garlic than ginger but satisfying nonetheless!\\n\\nAll in all, I recommend nixing the additional set and stick with the ramen and save yourself a few extra dollars.  Go here and enjoy the ramen because that'll that you need and you'll satisfied for sure!!!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Yup, I went to Voodoo for the first time this past Spring break and I honestly don't know what the hype is about.

We started off with the lobster soup, meh...good flavor/heavy, a couple scant pieces of lobster meat.  Asked for a basic salad and asked specifically for NO feta and dressing on the side.  I got a lot of feta and dressing tossed with my salad, awesome.  But I still picked at it, the dressing was pretty tasty.  My fiance got the same as me pretty much except for the entrees.

I like their meatball sub, they are legitimately homemade. Their sauce is nice as well, it has a subtle non-overpowering flavor and it's not chunky, I like it. Another plus about the meatballs, they give you like 5 or 6 FULL MEATBALLS, there is nothing worse than when a sub place takes a couple of meatballs and cuts them up.\\n\\nIt's a nice mom and pop style sub shop, a very nice family runs it.

Once they remember they're at work they can barely figure out how to do it and when they do it's with an attitude. \\n\\nI usually sit at the bar inside, but it was nice today so I grabbed a little table. After a spell the waiter rolls up and hands me a menu. I say, \\"I don't need one, thanks.\\" Before I can get on with it he looks at me and says, \\"you can't just sit here\\". NO SHIT, SHERLOCK. I come here everyday, I already know what I want. You cut me off before I could order. \\n\\nSo I order a grilled cheese with tomatoes and a black coffee. Oh, make sure you're writing this down Einstein, it's real hard. Even though he managed to scribble down the order after a few tries he still F'd it up. I ate it without comment. \\n\\nSo then the other servers are roaming about and I see this one dude. Tall with a huge honker. He's wearing possibly the dirtiest clothes I've ever seen on anyone outside of the hobo set. His hat is grimy with hippie hair grease and I've actually seen hobos with shorts cleaner than his. FILTHY. How about a dress code for the servers? Being cleaner than a Hells Angel's balls would be a good start.

Also there was a singer/guitarist performing outside, playing voodoo themed songs, like Eagles \\"Witchy Woman\\" which set the mood, I guess.\\n\\nWe finally made it inside and noticed how crazy and fun it was inside. There's a bunch of donut and voodoo themed art in the walls. There was glass stained windows, a huge doughnut sculpture, a rotating display of donuts, and my favorite... a picture of Joe Manganiello. We ordered a few donuts which were the voodoo doll doughnut, the ODB, and the dirt doughnut doughnut. I wasn't a fan of the voodoo doll v other than that it had the voodoo doll design. The dirt doughnut doughnut was a glazed doughnut with crushed oreos, and the ODB doughnut was the same as the dirt doughnut but had peanut butter. I super liked the ODB doughnut, because I love the PB and Oreo combo.\\n\\nAs you may have seen, the doughnuts here are very creative and tasty.

Nothing like sitting in the patio overlooking False Creek meanwhile sipping a nice cool glass of mango lassi and enjoying a plate of butter chicken, lol.  \\n\\nFor the decor, it's pretty much like any generic India restaurant.  A few India pictures and paraphernalia/decorations around the establishment.  There is a lot room for seating, so it's unlikely you'll be waiting for a table (although I have heard it's a bit packed for lunches).  \\n\\nThe review on the food.... I'm not much of a picky eater.  I would prefer quantity over quality.  That being said, this location seems to have a better variety and quality than other Indian restaurants.  Most other places only serve vegetarian choices, but for New India Buffet, they do have some meat options as well.  \\nI am a huge butter chicken guy, so they serving it.... AYCE.... it's perfect for me.  It's obviously not as tasty as when you order the individual set menu, but for a buffet, it's all about quantity.  The other choices are decent as well, the paneer dishes and some of those other curry ones (I'm not too familiar with the names).  There's also a salad bar (I dunno why anyone would waste space on it, but each there own).  Lastly, the desert section, I believe there's Jello (sure, why not?), but primarily those Gulab Jamun (?).  They're very sweet as it's basically just milk balls drenched in honey.... kinda hard to eat the first couple of times, but eventually you'll learn to love them.\\n\\nWhile the options are nice, it's not without it's problems.  Some selections aren't all that tasty.  The meat curry really tasted more like tomato pasta sauce (I guess some shared ingredients) and the chicken vindaloo are usually too dry.  \\n\\n3/5 stars because the price isn't too high and there's lots of flavours to choose from.  Not really for those who wants the most tastiest authentic Indian cuisine (actual menus available too), but for those who are interested in trying something different (international folks), it's a great place to go to.\\nAbout $16(?) plus there's also a coupon from the Entertainment book, it's not a bad deal overall."},{"name":"Ray's New York Pizza","address":"26 5th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Awesome place.

It's a great alternative from all the standard restaurants if you want a finer dining experience. I wouldn't even call it fusion Vietnamese cuisine. To me, it is homestyle Vietnamese food done using great cooking techniques, creativity, and care for flavours.

Must trys includes: Duck Confit Sliders, Frog Legs, Reconstructed Pho, Tamarind Chicken, Pork Belly and Anise, Cabernet Beef Shank (Bo Kho), Vietnamese Crepes, both ice cream desserts (Vietnamese Coffee and Avocado), Black Eyed Peas dessert.\\n\\nThe service was tremendous. I made a reservation at the restaurant for about 35 people on a Saturday night. I didn't book out the whole restaurant, as I didn't want to take away from the walk-ins. The service was prompt, accommodating, and the food came out very quickly for such a large party. We were there from 6pm - 8:30pm - that included seating, ordering, serving, and devouring.

I was in Boston with my wife and daughter for the weekend and wanted to show my daughter the view from the Skywalk (the observation deck from the 50th floor of the Prudential building.); however, it was closed due to a function. My wife was shopping and my daughter seemed so disappointed, so I decided I would take her to the restaurant and get a drink and let her get a peek. I thought they would let her in the bar area since it was an establishment that sold food. I was wrong, so I told the host the situation and told him I'd be willing to get a couple of drinks and an appetizer, but we were planning to have dinner later and had to meet my wife in 45 min. I waited about 3 min. (maybe less) and he found us a table by the window and I was told \\"Take your time\\".  This was a Saturday night around 6pm. The place was busy and not one table near the window was vacant. I was clearly under dressed for this place and no one said anything about spending $25 (like the other review mentioned). It was a hot day and going to the Red Sox game was a possibility when we left the hotel, so my attire was more for having dinner at a sports bar. My daughter and I were treated like we were regulars. I ordered an appetizer and I had a scotch and beer. I believe the bill was around $40 and I made sure to leave around 30% tip. My only regret was not getting the host's name because he was the best.

The experience with The Optimist actually started earlier in the day when I called from New York where I had been stuck because of airline delays for two days. I had dinner reservations to celebrate our anniversary and with the connections and returning home there was no way that we could make our reserved time. Without hesitation the staff member on the phone offered 7:00 or 7:30 or whatever else would work for us.\\n\\nWe arrived and everyone from the person who first greeted us to our wonderful waitress, Katie, we were treated like VIPs (although to be honest it appears that this is what they did for everyone). I spotted not far from our table another table where a noted Atlanta chef and restaurant owner was sitting with his party and the attention paid to them by the staff was no different than what we were treated to.\\n\\nThe cocktails were fabulous as was their beer and wine selection. One of our favorite cocktails was the MOTHER OF PEARL, a combination of Death's Door Gin, Fever Tree Tonic Water, Fee Brothers celery bitters, celery salt/black pepper, fennel frond and celery leaf. Our server did a wonderful job steering us not so much away from some dishes as to some truly outstanding ones. Going back to the staff again, as we have all experienced at one point or another - you have wonderful meal only to have the experience ruined by one or multiple staff members who are just bad or perhaps having a bad night. Dinner at The Optimist was like visiting the Apple Store if it were a restaurant  ... stay as long as you like ... talk to the staff ... meet your neighbor ....even play a little golf or Disney where the staff is always on since it is always someone's first time. \\n\\nThe design and atmosphere were awesome as you can easily transport yourself to the beach or anyplace near the water that you want to be.\\n\\nAs I said before, the food was perfect. Each dish came out hot, beautifully presented and delicious.  We had oysters, figs, halibut, striped bass, mushrooms, hush puppies and dessert. I can't really describe the food other than to say it was excellent -- you really need to experience it yourself.\\n\\nIn this day and age, especially with little kids (and having to pay a babysitter) no evening is inexpensive and when it's all said and done you hope that with all the money you spend that you have a great time ... we most certainly did here. Not only would I recommend The Optimist without reservation I would tell you just come and chat with anyone on the staff ... it will make you feel better about your day.

Many flavor choices and for buffalo hot they have 5 levels of hot 1st degree to 5th degree. \\n\\nLiz was quick to point out that the last guy she saw eat the hottest 5th degree he was in tears. So I went for the 4th degree (my usual choice at Roosters is \\"hot\\") 4th degree has great flavor but they are HOT, not painful hot, just very hot! Will get 3rd degree next time. \\n\\nWe had stuffed tots and wedge salad and both great. Prices are very reasonable as well.\\n\\nHope they expand their outdoor seating area for summertime. They have a unique beverage drive-thru attached to the the building where you can also pick up a take out order.\\n\\nCan't say will not go to Roosters again ( I am sure we will!) but Woodys is a great alternative and will no doubt give Roosters some competition!"},{"name":"Fogg 'n' Suds Restaurant & Beer Bar","address":"10720 Cambie Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"You can't beat them when it comes to wings Wednesday. 4 stars\\n\\nBreakfast ain't bad.

They looked like they were about to set sail with crispy triangles jutting into the air. The taste, however, was horrific. The scallops had none of the sweetness that I savor in scallops. The quinoa crust and slight overcooking killed that. The \\"cannelloni\\" were tiny (size of a kid's pinky finger) crepes and if they had crab filling, I'm not sure where, cuz I saw and tasted nothing in them. As if those flavors and the bland puree weren't bad enough, the duet of reductions tasted like tart & sweet runny jelly and made anything salvageable on the plate completely grotesque.

The place is very popular, so expect to wait in line. The cool thing is that they never close.

This is my favorite one.\\n\\nTriple Chocolate Penetration - chocolate cake doughnut with chocolate frosting and coco-puffs. If you love chocolate this is the one to get. The cake doughnut is very moist and has a nice consistency. The chocolate frosting brings a nice addition of moisture to the cake doughnut. The coco-puffs add a magnificent crunchy texture to the mix. Excellent!\\n\\nMemphis Mafia - Fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon sugar covered in a glaze with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips on top. Wow! this one is a sweetness overload. I really like the mix of textures in this one. It may be a little sweet for those that don't have the sweetest of sweet-tooths. I Like it!\\n\\nCock and Balls - Cock-n-balls shaped raised yeast doughnut triple filled with Bavarian cream and topped with chocolate frosting. It has \\"Bite Me!\\" iced on it, haha! This one is a picture favorite with the females. If you're here with a hot chick, make sure you take a picture of her suggestively eating it. Hopefully, if you're smooth enough it will be an idea of good things to come. Haha! Alright, enough of me being disgusting. This one is more visually special, but taste wise its pretty normal.

Typical cheese or mushroom enchiladas. But the secret to a great vegan meal at Elsi's is avoiding the vegetarian section of the menu entirely.\\n\\nElsi's makes the best veggie chorizo I've ever had, seasoned with chunks of pepper and onions. So far I've gotten enchiladas, tacos, burritos, and taco salad with veggie chorizo as the filling, and the wait staff never blinks an eye at my substitutions. I know restaurants don't have to be so flexible, so I really appreciate this. The taco salad is my favorite of all those (ask for black beans and no cheese or sour cream to get it fully vegan).

I'd love it to be a little less than $3 plus but it's definitely a once in a while treat to be had. What impressed me was the Decaf. In my mind you can tell a lot about a coffee shop with how they do their decaf. Why you ask? Because it's rarely ordered and not often even considered. So if they do their decaf right, then you know they are thinking of all the details. Now they didn't have \\"drip\\" decaf but they made me a decaf Americano. It was fantastic! The best I think I've had. \\n\\nTip - If you are in a decaf mood, spice it up! Add some cinnamon, or in my case about ten shakes of cinnamon, a package of natural sugar and milk. You might love it like I do. I have no clue how I came about this but it's the only way I have my Americano.\\n\\nThe Washroom is hipster modern and very clean. Another good sign that they are keeping the whole place clean and tidy. \\n\\nThe Staff are very, very professional and friendly. The cafe seems very busy even when there aren't a lot of customers.

King + Duke is decorated to resemble a library with bookshelves adorned with vintage books and leather accents. The service was top-notch and the food was to die for.  I don't think you could go wrong with anything you tried but I definitely found some don't miss items! One of the first dishes we tried was the Maine Crab Toast- it is offered as \\"Bites\\" on the menu and is a perfect appetizer to share. It was almost like a crab salsa with a kick and served with seasoned toast.  A great start to our meal and definitely got me excited for the dishes to come! For dinner I ordered the Bar Steak and Fries. It was the perfect way to experience the 24-foot wood fire grill that the restaurant is known for. I also lusted after the \\"The Duke\\" which Cason and Audra ordered and was a fine-looking burger! Last but definitely not least we ordered desserts to share; by far the best one I tried was the Baked Mousse. It included malted milk cake, ice cream, and Butterfinger bits ...sold! Sharing a bottle of wine and gossiping with my girlfriends at King + Duke was the perfect night out I was looking for!\\n\\nRead the full review here: http://sitwithusblog.com/kinganddukereview/\\n\\nWant to see more restaurant reviews?

We also split poached pears. All of it was good! I was not absolutely blown away by the food, but I was certainly not disappointed either. I thought it was good quality and fit the place and the price point well.

It was seasoned perfectly, and was tangy and delicious. Next, we got the grilled asparagus, which was tied in a bundle like a bouquet, and was seasoned to perfection. At the same time, we got a side of potatoes, which came with came interesting dips - think spicy red pepper sauce and a garlicy aioli.\\n\\nNext came my personal fav: the scallops. They came in a little pot, and tasted like they were caramelized in a french on onion soup. Foodie heaven. We finished our feast with a half order of lamb which was grilled  a perfect medium rare and came with a potato fritter stuffed with cheese and fried until it was crunchy.\\n\\nI was so stuffed, but had to try dessert, so we ordered the chocolate truffle since it is small.

Little did I know that ordering two eggs meant I was getting an entire second meal, complete with home fries, sausage, and toast! There goes my Paramount pro status. I'm officially a newb again. The way it was listed on the menu, I thought that I was merely getting two eggs as a side. Luckily, I was absolutely ravenous, and was able to do considerable damage to the two platefuls of grub.\\n\\nThere wasn't anything special about the food, but it was good. Eggs are eggs. Toast is toast. It's pretty hard to do breakfast food badly, at least in my experience. I loved the French toast with caramel and bananas.

Unfortunately, the water is nightmare-inducing. Under the glowing, magical lights, you can see every particle that's come off the bodies of your fellow soakers, and it's pretty horrific. We all stank noticeably after leaving the pool, and today I'm itchy and broken out. I loved the experience of sitting in the pool at night, but probably won't be returning anytime soon.\\n\\nThis is not to say that the Kennedy School doesn't have its charms.

The blackened shrimp was cooked to perfection, not chewy or rubbery. Not sure what kind of bread it was served on, but toasted and delicious. The ahi tuna again was cooked perfectly and delicious. Lastly the salmon finished out the trio. While my least favorite of the three, I would have no problems sharing it again. I had the pancetta and berry salad. I usually order my salads dry so that it's not drowned in dressing (not a fan of restaurants ruining meals with condiments). But I wanted to see what happened. It was a raspberry vinaigrette and was just the right amount for me. Great salad and I'll order it again. On my second visit, I again did the sliders (blackened shrimp only) and again perfect for me. I created my own burger this time. Just a good ol fashioned bacon cheeseburger.  Asked for medium, came medium. Full of flavor. Bacon was how I liked it and chewy not crispy. Had the homemade waffle chips as the side and what a great twist to make something original and your own. Served in a small basket just the right size to complete the burger and not to fill your belly! Lastly and most importantly. The key lime pie!  All desserts made in house. I'm usually not a fan of altering a recipe. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  But this crust had cinnamon or some spice added to it and it was a great surprise. The key lime was creamy and not overly tart. I'll order this every time. Make you wanna slap yo momma good!  My wife ordered the bread pudding.  Huge serving, not soggy!

They just put up a Christmas tree for the holidays too, really pretty! Also great location in the Short North!\\n\\nPrice: apps range from like $8-15, sandwiches/salads/pizzas are around $15, more upscale entrees are $20-28, cocktails ~$10. Overall affordable upscale modern dining imo, well worth the price. \\n\\nService: never had any issues with service, we were always seated promptly and waiters/waitresses took time to explain the menu and any specials. Food comes out pretty fast too.\\n\\nAnd of course, food: the menu rotates (maybe every 3-6 months), but all of the food I've gotten here is exceptional. My favorite was a short rib appetizer that is sadly no longer on the menu, but I remember the short ribs just melting in your mouth (please bring it back!). I also have gotten the pork sugo ($22) twice, which is pappardelle with shredded pork, in a buttery hazelnut sauce - very flavorful and filling. I've gotten the seafood of the day twice also - first time was an amazing crab tempura with sriracha glaze and second time was haddock with brussel sprouts and potatoes in a white wine sauce. \\n\\nOverall, one of my go-to restaurants in Columbus for special occasions and when outside friends are in town and I want to take them somewhere nice.

Just getting to the restaurant is a bristly experience.  If you get there when they open at 11:30, you can enter the elevator, and the doors will close, but you can't go up.  The button for the 52nd floor, where TotH is located, will not light.  The elevator might even take you to the basement of the building, as it did us, where you will sit and wonder what's gone wrong.  On the basement level, the door will not open.  There probably wasn't a good view down there anyway.\\n\\nAfter we were permitted to activate the 52nd floor button at 11:35, we were seated quickly at a nice table near the window.  The view was nice.  At that point, we were handed menus for a Prix Fixe Valentines Day brunch, for $55 per person, drinks not included.  I asked the waiter if they were serving the usual lunch menu items as well, and he said no, that they were instead serving a special Valentine's Day brunch, which he described as, \\"you know, for the romance\\".  He was not polite.  He was eager to argue over whether the menu was posted on the web site, and he wanted to enlist his manager in the argument.  I said no thank you and we left.  If they were trying for \\"romance\\", they could start with being polite and accommodating.\\n\\nWhen I went back to the web site after we left the restaurant, it *did* have a link at the bottom of the page that mentioned a special Prix Fixe Valentine's Weekend.  However, it did *not* mention that the VD menu would be the ONLY menu available.\\n\\nThe menu switcheroo was not a welcome surprise for several reasons.  First, there were mostly meaty dishes on TotH's VD menu, and we are vegetarians.  Second, the price of the VD Prix Fixe menu was over double the cost of the $22 Prix Fixe lunch option we saw online.  Third, the menu was standard brunch fare that I would consider ambitiously priced at $15/entree.  Fourth, Valentine's Day was 2 days ago, so I wouldn't have even imagined they would be doing a special menu on Saturday, to celebrate what came and went on Thursday.  In my opinion, it is also odd that they would open at 11:30 to serve brunch and offer no lunch options.\\n\\nI feel like what Top of the Hub is doing, substituting a $55 Prix Fixe menu, basically without warning, for the much less expensive lunch menu, is a scam.

The sliders were delish, I could have easily ordered more, and they had the perfect sauce base, rather than a vinegar base which I'm not a fan on. The pie was to die for.

The broccoli souffle is a classic southern broccoli casserole, and the mac and cheese was to die for. They also gave us a basket with cornbread, warm cinnamon rolls, and yeast rolls. The basket was my dad's favorite part because he loves big portions and free food. The portions were so large that we all had to take half of our food home.

I was really surprised by the size of the burger, especially the size of the turkey patty.  The patty was a little larger than a breakfast sausage patty.  So the burger was more like an appetizer or slider.  The french fries were a little bit undercooked or maybe tasted like they had been frozen.  I think you all know the taste.  Eventhough the burger was rather meager, it was full of flavor and delicious.  But, for the size versus the taste, the cost was not warrented.  My hipstress was charming, cute, nice and efficient!!

Needless to say, those things are great separately, but together, well, you can do that math.\\n\\nAs far as the entre√©s went, I tried The Jackalope. This was really adventurous for me, as I had never really eaten too many gamey foods. This Frank original was INCREDIBLE. As far as sausages go, it was juicy and oh so flavorful! It didn't taste gamey at all, but was a great experience trying antelope, especially for the first time!"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Woot woot!! While in Boston I hit the jackpot with this place. We went off of a recommendation of a local, and we figured going to the \\"nations oldest restaurant\\" would be a pretty cool place to dine. \\n\\nI ordered the lobster roll and it was out of this world!! Extremely fresh, doesn't have that fishy taste (being from NM, I wasn't aware the seafood wasn't supposed to taste like it was drug across the ocean floor haha) and a hearty portion with fries/slaw. My friend ordered the mussels and they were mind blowing. The butter-onion-garlic broth imparted a delicious flavor to the dish and once again, they didn't get lazy on the portions. My lobster roll was about $20 and had a beer for $6, so it isn't necessarily the place to go if you want to penny pinch while in Beantown. \\n\\nOur server was adorable and extremely personable, and definitely added to the experience.

Food is great and so are the portions. Chicken piccata and the Gnocchi with the braised beef are to die for. Most entree's come with a house salad which is a nice touch that most places don't do anymore. The dressings are fantastic, and I have never had a bad meal there. Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the service can sometimes be slow (albeit always friendly), but I also think thats because it can get busy and cramped. Overall though, place is awesome.

I know Portland is known for their lines, but Broder piles onto this by taking forever to clean up tables. I waited 45 minutes and then ate in 30, so there needs to be a change there. \\n\\nI had the Swedish Hash meal which came with two eggs and smoked fish.

Top of the Hub is a restaurant and bar 82 floors up in the Prudential Center, and a couple of floors above the Skywalk Observatory.  After spending some time in the observatory, we decided to come up here for a cocktail, and it was worth the trip.\\n\\nThe only drawback to Top of the Hub is that it wasn't designed as well as it could have been.  When you come up from the elevator, you will see that dining tables line the windows on all 4 sides.  There is a bar, but the bar is set back from the windows with tables behind it, so that if you just want to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink and the view, you cannot because the bar is there.  I understand why this was done - you want to give your tables the best view - but it would have been nice had they left a small section - maybe a wrap around bar - so that at least some of your happy hour patrons can also enjoy the view.  As it stands, there are signs everywhere advising guests that the dining area is not an observation deck and that you cannot stand around the tables.\\n\\nThey do have a small lounge area with couches where you can get a partial view.  However, the area by the windows is set aside for a stage for their lounge singer.  Again, a nice touch, but it seems like if you're not eating, you're not welcome to a premium view.\\n\\nThat said, the lounge area does offer you the opportunity to have a drink high above the city, listen to some music (the lounge singer was very good), and enjoy the view you can get.  After all, they are floor to ceiling windows, so even if you're not right up against them, you can still see large parts of the city.\\n\\nIt reminded me a bit of Atlanta - I think its the Westin Hotel, downtown, that has the rotating restaurant and lounge at the top floor.  There, too, the window seats are reserved for the dining guests, but bar patrons can get a good view, though set back a bit from the windows.  Similarly, here, you can have a wonderful drink (did I mention the drinks were excellent?  No?  The drinks were excellent) listen to some laid back music, and watch the city come alive at night far below."},{"name":"Lambert's Rainbow Market","address":"777 Morrissey Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4.5","text":"INEXPENSIVE meats.

Writing this around dinner time actually makes me want to go to there."},{"name":"Caf√© 47","address":"47 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The suggestion of sweet potato fries has an ability to lure me to restaurants I haven't been to before.  But, I do have to find something else interesting on the menu to actually step in through the door.  In the case of Cafe 47, it was their Eggplant Rollatini $8.\\n\\nOh, yeah, and was I satisfied with both picks!  The eggplant rolls were served two to an order of hot crispy cheeseyness in a good red sauce.  The pile of crispy light sweet potato fries $3.50 served with a tasty honey mustard that was remniscient (to me anyhow, and only in color) of the cheese sauce served on the side of nachos in the movie theater. \\n\\nNow that we have already eaten, enjoyed, and digested our meal, I realize that we had over-erred on the side of caution by ordering our Spinach & Bacon Pizza $14 with caramelized onions thrown in (At no extra charge!  Nice!) as a large, rather than as a small for $8.  This was served on a pan to keep it hot and crisp, and lifted off the table on a wire rack to save table space for our fries which we were still picking at.  Parmesan cheese and red pepper flake shakers were brought over without us needing to request them.  Since we had already tamed the edge of our appetites with the fries and eggplant, and I had my eye on a specific dessert that was listed first on their dessert blackboard by the bar, we could only manage to consume two slices of the pizza each, while plotting to take 2 slices home apiece.  The crust of our pie was the thin and crispy sort.\\n\\nOkay, dessert... Caramel Banana Cheesecake $5... doesn't that sound good?  Not quite like an eggroll, more like a thin pastry wrapped roll of melty creamy goodness, served beside a swirl of whipped cream.  Sweet, yet not too sweet.  Yum!  Too bad it isn't on their regular dessert menu - must have been a daily special.\\n\\nService was friendly and pleasant.  Bathrooms were individual ones per gender and found in the back left, similarly colored as with the rest of the establishment and plenty clean enough.

We usually get Chinese or Asian food at Talk and Wok, but once in a while we feel like trying something else.  We've ordered from Asian Thai probably 10 times total, and I would say 5 of those times, it was great---one or two of those extremely great.  The other 5 times, it was no good at all.  It seems like they have totally different chefs or recipes different days.  The good or bad doesn't seem to follow a pattern.  Sometimes the Tom Yum soup is delicious, and has both chicken and shrimp in it, sometimes it's terrible and has just one or the other.  Sometimes the Pad Thai is truly epic, and again, has lots of chicken AND shrimp, other times it's horrible and has one or the other, and very little of it.  Overall, I think the appetizer type foods are better than the entrees, but again, not consistent.  We  have always gotten takeout, so I can't speak to their delivery or eat-in.  The order takers are inconsistent also.  I don't think they've ever been rude, but sometimes they seem completely new at English and at order-taking in general, and it takes about 15 minutes to get them to take a simple order.  \\n\\nSo, if you're in the mood to gamble, give this place a try!

We took the one clean table for two.  (At least half the tables that needed to be bussed still needed to be bussed at the time we left, an agonizing 80 minutes later.)\\n\\nWhen we arrived, our waiter Karl handed us menus and then disappeared for about 5 minutes.  When he returned he took our order for an appetizer and a drink order for two slightly dirty vodka martinis.  Our appetizer arrived a short time later.  The deviled eggs and bacon wrapped dates were quite good.   Karl returned to take our remaining order.  I requested to salmon BLT to which Karl responded, \\"oh, I was hoping you wouldn't ask for salmon, we don't have any\\".   Seriously?   Rather than inform me up front that you were out, you were just \\"hoping\\" neither of us would select that?   Now our time deciding had been wasted because Karl hadn't supplied us with an accurate  representation of what he could provide.    We both ordered chicken wrap instead, and I ordered the Kale/Potato soup.   It would be 20 minutes before anyone returned to our table.  We had no water to sip after our appetizers, and finally, 20 minutes later two drinks were brought to our table in champagne coupe style glasses and the drinks were brown in color, similar to bourban or whiskey.   They were obviously not slightly dirty vodka martinis.  Frankly, what real bartender doesn't know how to add olive juice to vodka?   We didn't even try them, we simply sent them back.  So now we still have nothing to drink, not even water, and none of our food has come out.  We wait another 15 minutes.\\n\\nAt this point, the \\"bartender\\" is sitting with some guests at a table, her phone at the bar is ringing off the wall, and our waiter has all but disappeared, and we have been served no food since our appetizers 35 minutes earlier.    At this same time, Karl returns and gives a check to the man and his daughter sitting next to us.  The man immediately says, \\"can I please give you my credit card NOW, I can't wait anymore.\\"    But this fell on deaf ears as Karl walked away to disappear again.   We commiserated with this fellow patron on how poor the service was.   He finally gave up waiting and left cash, which he didn't want to do because it forced him to tip more than he wanted, but he didn't have time to wait.\\n\\nOur food eventually came, after complaining to the manager, and it was actually quite good.  In fact, the kale and potato soup was outstanding.   But certainly not worth the subpar and extremely slow service.\\n\\nPerhaps the management could be more concerned about training than they are with computerized waiter tablets."},{"name":"La Hacienda Mexican Restaurant","address":"2260 S Volusia Ave","city":"Orange City","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is hands down the best Mexican restaurant around.

The waitress checked on me by stealth: she would pass by my table, getting just past my peripheral vision, then she'd come back just behind my ear and startle me with her loud voice. I would have forgiven this if it had only happened one time, but she did this repeatedly.

It was a little bit noisy, but I think that owes to the small size of the place and the proximity of the kitchen to the dining area.  \\n\\nThe restaurant works on a \\"fresh-local-sustainable\\" model, creating dishes from ingredients sourced from the proprietor's farm in Canal Winchester and other local farmers and vendors.  Understanding this, I expected the food to be carefully prepared and very tasty, and I was not disappointed.  \\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer of hummus with warm pita and veggies, which I acknowledge is not really venturing out on a culinary limb.  Still, the hummus was fresh and flavorful, was not too garlicky, and was served with a nice spread of pita and sliced vegetables.  \\n\\nNext, we were served warm, dense bread from the Angry Baker.  It came with a side of strawberry mint butter, the flavors of which were so delicate they were unfortunately lost in the hearty bread.\\n\\nThe entrees were spectacular.  My mother-in-law and I both got the pumpkin ravioli, which paired a nicely spiced pumpkin filling with a cream sauce featuring mushrooms and walnuts.  Evoking feelings of fall, it was the perfect dish for a rainy Saturday afternoon.  My husband ordered the duck gnocchi.  Served with a garlic-cream sauce, cranberries, and goat cheese, it was so heavenly that I sneaked several tastes from his plate.  The duck, described as \\"slow-roasted\\" on the menu, was moist and flavorful.  Paired with the gnocchi, the dish was an elegant take on meat-and-potatoes.  My sister-in-law had the Risotto du Jour, which that day was a creamy but still light risotto with goat cheese and chives.  All of the dishes were full of complex flavors and well-executed.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can't say that the service blew me away as much as the food did.  I realize that any restaurant is not on its A-game at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  It's not prime time, it's grandma hour, and we were the only people in the restaurant when we walked in.  However, we waited a couple of minutes to be seated, several minutes to be greeted by our server, and a fair amount of time for each course to come out.  Considering that there were no other diners in the place at this point, that was a little frustrating.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive, but he came off just a bit snarky, mentioning a couple of times how much he was refilling my husband's water glass and making multiple comments on our table's professed enjoyment of goat cheese.  I think he was trying to make friendly banter with us, but some of it fell flat and made me feel like he was poking fun at us. \\n\\nOverall, I had a great meal at the Black Creek Bistro, and I'd definitely return.

Wow!  What an unexpected and marvelous discovery!!!\\n\\nI think I've been back about ten times since!  Not only is the food excellent, with some of my oldest NL favorites back to their original yumminess (or even better), the service is prompt and generally curteous - and the location is simply knock-out gorgeous.

Not a problem, it takes time to get comfortable in your environment. The ambience is a bit different, as the bar was quite busy but the table area was a bit sparse and quiet, maybe 1/3rd filled at 6:30pm. It's not in the busiest neighborhood, so you're definitely there to go to Townsman. More on ambience, the music was all over the place, from Jhene Aiko to Simon & Garfunkel, but whatever appeals to people.\\n\\nThe dinner got off to a very slow start, as I waited 10+ min for my first drink, an Orchard Collins. Didn't have quite the bite I'd expect for a Granny Smith apple and lemon mix, but I'd def order again. Friend got the old fashioned \\"on tap,\\" which was strange because it didn't really come much faster. That was good too, as was the Kingston Cup (I think? It was a spicy Pimm's cup), and then we got a celery juice cocktail which was on the good side of flavor profiles, but in comparison to another veggie-based drink, this beet syrup + tequila mix at Viale, it wasn't memorable. \\n\\nFood was good, but it didn't really come together for me. We got the crostini w/ middleneck clams & ham - that was amazing. Could have had 2 of those. Lamb crudo looked interesting on the menu but we've never had it before and probably wouldn't again, the texture and flavor were kind of bland. I enjoyed the curry crab and spinach dip, but it was more of a spinach dip than it had curry or coconut flavor, and had more of a crab smell than discernible pieces. Fun dish though with radishes and various flora toppings. More of a highlight were the octopus (whatever sauce they had on it was amazing and it had just the right crisp-on-the-outside, good-chewy texture) and the semolina bigoli (I love a doughy pasta, and for the best doughy pastas go to Giulia!). The merguez bits and tiny snails on the noodles were super flavorful.\\n\\nWe initially ordered the duck for an entree but got super full so they let us cancel it, which was nice. While a bit awkward at times, the staff was nothing but friendly. I came back to the table after a bathroom and break and found my napkin nearly folded.

Some of the dishes were good, some were too salty.  We started off with a soup with some green leafy vegetable and small beef pieces in it; decent enough to start off the rest of the meals.  My favorite was the sweet/sour porkchops. i didnt find the ginger scallion lobsters to be that much better than ones I've had elsewhere.   The fried tofu was nice and crispy, however, thought it tasted like it was cooked in \\"old oil\\".  The beef and greenbeans was tasty but quite salty.

Moving on, we had the grilled asparagus, the \\"Antichucho de Pollo\\" - chicken kebabs - and a Causa Morada. The Causa was particularly interesting, being a cake of purple potato with spicy chicken and a nice lime/pesto drizzle. After dinner, we had great coffee and a very affordably priced aged Madeira. Just what we were looking for, slightly late on a weeknight! \\n\\nOne more thing - we noticed three middle aged gentlemen having a very animated discussion at one of the tables when we walked in to the bar.

Considering we were the only people there, I think he could have been better. Maybe he was new? He didn't seem to know much about the cuisine, and added that the cooks spoke \\"African\\" and he had a hard time communicating any special requests to them. African? Really?\\n\\nAnd finally,  the food was bad. I had the Mixed Vegetables in Coconut Milk: Various fresh vegetables cooked with coconut milk. Served over white rice. It tasted like something I attempted to make at home. The sauce was simply coconut milk with yellow curry powder. The veggies were good, but the whole thing was flavorless. My boyfriend had the Thu Yap: Lamb with vegetables in mild alicha seasoning served with white rice or couscous. It tasted like stew. Nothing special. \\n\\nBasically bad food, with OK service, and awful atmosphere. It's always empty, so if you are looking for a quiet place to bring a group for a drink, this is it.

It seemed like an error as our appetizers hadn't even arrived but we were hungry so we didn't ask questions. But the pizza was cold and undercooked. No bueno.

He called a week and a half in advance to make reservations. My bday fell on a Saturday night so it worked out well. When we arrived it was very crowded, not surprisingly. Many tourists going up just for drinks and a view. We were greeted rather unenthusiastically and brought to our table a few minutes later.\\n\\nNow, this is where it all went wrong. From the moment we got there the customer service was pretty much nonexistent. Which I found surprising for such a nice place. Then we were seated at literally the smallest table I've ever been at for a dinner.  It was right near the entrance to the dining area. The table was right against the wall divider between the room and hallway everyone was walking down. We had one arm against the wall - not comfortable. Super crammed. I looked around and saw other tables with more space. Somehow we got the major shaft. It seemed like the restaurant added a row of tables, farthest from the window just to add more tables to squeeze as much business as they can out of the space. I honestly don't know how 2 entrees and drinks would fit on the table. Now, if we had just gone up for drinks and hadn't made reservations well in advance, I wouldn't complain. But I was shocked with the space and lack of atmosphere. My husband is also 6'3\\" and this table was extra uncomfortable for him. He politely went up to the hostess to see if they might possibly have another table. We really did want to stay awhile and just felt that space was not appropriate for a special dinner. Well, they had us stand up and wait over by the hostess area. No one really spoke to us. 5 minute went by then 10. I looked at my husband and said 'we can't spend our money here.' The prices are steep - and in my opinion if you're going to ask top dollar your service should match that. We left - no one said anything. We went to The Capital Grille instead. A place we love and a place with always excellent customer service. We learned our lesson with this one. Top of the Hub feels like a tourist trap now. Maybe good for drinks but I wouldn't spend my money on dinner there. Go to Capital Grill instead - if you are celebrating an occasion they roll out the red carpet. We always feel like our business is appreciated."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Used a OpenTable to make reservations and a LivingSocial deal which gave us two cocktails and two small plates. The atmosphere was lovely, except for one of the hostesses that seemed very under dressed. (Imagine Portland hipster submerged in Grace Kelly's world). \\n\\nThe cocktails were both good. I really enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum. The Mule Kick was spicy, but it was suppose to be. Smoky Chicken soup was unique and worth for sure worth $5. Risotto was technically well made but the flavor combination wasn't my favorite. The forest mushrooms were good, although I'm pretty sure I could have made the same thing by stopping at New Seasons, buying a variety of mushrooms, and grilling them with some butter in a pan. Also, they are served very hot, and it probably would have been best for the flavor to let them cool off a bit. Finally, the braised lamb. It was delicious and one of the best dishes I have had in Portland except...I found a small, sharp bone in the middle of it. Could have definitely caused an injury (this is what knocks them down from 4 stars to only 3). The server informed us that this dish did win an award at the Lamb Jam and the flavors were really wonderful. \\n\\nThe service was good and well timed. It seemed like as we finished one dish another was brought out. Check was processed quickly as well and we were able to have out parking validated (for up to two hours) at the front desk. \\n\\nThis place would be great for a date.

To remain \\"novo,\\" you have to keep things new.\\n\\nMy other issue is with the service. I'm 30 years old, younger than the typical patron here. On our last visit, or server seemed to disappear and was not very attentive. Her attitude was professional and hospitable, but the overall experience lacked the warmth I associate with superior performance. I may be young, but I top well for good service, and I take food seriously.\\n\\nWhile not a major issue, there's something people should know about the drinks here: they all lean heavily to the sweet end of the spectrum. The cocktail menu could be improved through the addition of some dry or bitter options. My pancreas can only handle so many citrus-sugar bombs at once.

But, the Union Oyster House experience was disappointing on so many levels.\\n\\nFor starters, we were in a group, and chose the place for its historic significance--being, I believe,the oldest continuous restaurant service in Boston, since 1826. That said, if they managed over that span like what we experienced, I can't imagine it still being there.\\n\\nWe had pre-arranged everything for a group of 30-ish. We did our part. All seemed well, but in order to have a private room, even with spending more than $2K, we were made to pay a room charge. Then, even though they boast a wonderful local menu, they deprived us of choosing from that menu, and offered our group only four menu selections, with no prices given to us, no menus to see, no checks delivered, and an attitude if we asked to see a menu that really we should be separated from the group if we wanted to order from the menu. That said, the entrees--at our table steak and haddock were both very tough, overcooked, with no specialness to them at all. I don't think they even asked if my husband wanted his steak well done. And both entrees were VERY pricey compared to other legendary eateries in town--about $10 per entree more. We were served dessert, without asking for it, but I am not sure whether that was added as an extra or not. When I check the menu online, it is $8.95 for a piece of cake--not equally sized among the party either. They were very unclear as to whether this was an extra charge. Our dessert was Boston cream pie, and it was so-so, for being their special local dessert fare.\\n\\nWe never got to see a check. For some reason, even though it seems each entree had a separate price (again, they were very unclear), they did not have checks for each member of the group. Instead, they seemed shocked we wanted to know how much our meal was. Our host finally asked them if it would be easier (for them) to just add it all up and split it evenly among us. They were very enthusiastic about that. It worked for them--not us. We ended up paying quite a bit more, unless the dessert and salad were extras, served with no choice, but charged. I am not as gracious as our host who was very kind to them. When two meals come out to $70 each, I expect excellence. This did not happen in quality of food, price, value, or presentation. And, certainly with these prices and the extremely noisy area, an extra room charge is outrageous.\\n\\nThe wait staff was very loud, and our \\"private\\" room was not buffered from constant noise of dishes clattering and staff shouting across rooms and from a P.A. We were trying to hear our speakers, and they almost had to say everything twice, or just stop talking to get their information out in between staff shoutings and dishes clanging.\\n\\nOur particular server was very nice and mostly kept an eye on our needs, except for water being refilled only once over about three hours. I am trying to find something postive to say. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place to try their best of local cuisine. Hopefully what we were served is not their best.

I gotta say, I think I'm getting sick of avo toast as I've ordered it quite abit in the past year. What I found strange about this one is they didn't butter the toast at all and didn't have salt or pepper on the table for seasoning.

My salmon was drier than the sand box, but it could have been worse.  Originally, I was going to order a steak and mango salad and luckily I asked about the ripeness of the mango.  The waitperson showed me a hard, whitish piece of plantlike material -- definitely not orange, definitely not juicy -- maybe it could have been mango.  My son had a burger -- on a brioche bun.  Brioche buns should be fresh and sweet and a little bit doughy -- this thing was stale and flavorless.  His fries weren't crispy or delicious.  Our vegetarian friend had a Grateful Veg which was served on a giant raft of white bread -- so every bite, all you tasted was bread.  \\n\\nStep it up, people!

I walked in expecting maybe rolls, or garlic bread, or even breadsticks. What I got was a quarter of a loaf of sliced, sesame-crusted, room temperature, untoasted white 'Italian' bread with cold butter pats that tore the bread when I tried to spread it. This is something I expect from the 'Italian' school lunch day, not a restaurant. Perhaps this is something others might pass over, but we were left with easily fifteen minutes between the appearance of bread and appearance of anything else on our table, including our drinks. My boyfriend remarked that they could have sold one or two of the pretty flat-screen TV's playing the games to afford to hire at least another waitress.\\n\\nNext: The Appetizer. For some reason, my boyfriend decided to tempt fate and try the half-order of Ultimate Nachos... at an Italian restaurant. Fate was not kind. As Alyssa S. found first, it was eight corn chips, buried underneath way too many toppings, including the hockey puck of ground beef buried in the middle like a node of lead inside the mountain of garnish.\\n\\nThe Main Course was next. We were looking for a light lunch, but Sunday was apparently dinner only, so we ordered an entree Caesar salad with the grilled chicken and a French-Onion soup. The soup was mediocre - a fantastic rich broth spoiled by huge chunks of onion, and the cheese was much too harsh. Our eyes, however, were fixated on the entree Caesar, served in what looked like a charger plate with a shallow dip in the middle, containing a tiny portion of dressed greens and croutons, one which would have been dismissed as a side salad at any other restaurant I'd been to, small enough that the skimpy grilled chicken cutlet entirely covered it.  Apparently the extra money was spent on a slice of cantaloupe, a piece of pineapple, a single strawberry and a 3oz plastic container of berry yogurt. I wasn't aware that \\"served with fresh fruit & yogurt\\" on a menu meant \\"sorry, we're going to stiff your portion for a sad fruit platter.\\" The waitress brought another bread basket along with the meal - apparently we were expected to fill up on that?! Or perhaps it was there to maintain the appearance of customer service, given the long waits for absolutely everything, including a refill and taking empty plates away.\\n\\nAbsolute waste of time and money."},{"name":"Armando's Pizzeria","address":"463 W New England Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"I have eaten here several times and my good friend talks very highly of this place however last night me and five of my girlfriends went out for a nice ladies night here and Armando the owner couldn't be more rude to us.

I was very excited to see a new Italian restaurant opened in Austin.  Let me start out by saying I would go back to Cherry St, I'm curious to try their pizza.  I had the calamari and thought the marinara sauce served with it was very good.  I also had the fresh mozzarella with beets and butternut squash.  I thought the freshly made mozzarella was very well done.  Not too dry, right amount of salt, very nice flavor.  So I'm assuming the pizza's there should be pretty good since I both enjoyed their sauce and cheese.  If it was not for my curiosity about the pizza, I wouldn't be going back.  The calamari was good, not the best I've had, but it definitely wasn't the worst.  The Spinach salad was bland, the butternut squash in both my mozzarella appetizer and salad has no flavor whatsoever.  I don't know if it was because it's still early in the season for them, but they were not crispy from being roasted and really had no flavor at all.  Usually roasted vegetables with the right seasonings are always sweeter.  The vinaigrette on the salad was nonexistent.  Also the candied walnuts were not \\"candied\\" at all, I love that nice crunch they should have, which these were lacking, it was more like they roasted walnuts and rolled them in a sugar mixture, NOT candied!  Needless to say I was not a fan of this salad.  The fresh mozzarella was the highlight for me, even though once again that flavorless butternut squash did nothing for that dish, the yellow beets were a nice mix.  I'm a HUGE fan of beets.  Never met a beet a didn't like.\\n\\nOn another note, the bench seats are very uncomfortable.  I'm not sure if anyone tested out that bench before they bought it, but its extremely uncomfortable!  My legs kept falling asleep while waiting for my food.  The bend in the wood is just SO uncomfortable!

We used to go to Gustav's on Sandy.  While not the best food, it was close, there was rarely a wait because it wasn't \\"cool\\", and they had a good German beer selection.  The restaurant was also a pretty decent place to hang.  But Gustav's closed, and it was a blessing in disguise.\\n\\nThere simply is no comparison.  Stammtisch's is absolutely fantastic all around.  The food is incredible, and I am a jaded Portlander with access to too many food options ;).  I had the Wienerschnitzel last time, with the most delicious carrot slaw and German potato salad to die for. I have also had the burger and the rabbit, and both were also fantastic.  The sausages are also on point.  The fries are great, and the pretzel is a nice appetizer if you find yourself famished upon arrival.\\n\\nThe beer selection consists exclusively of European beers (may even be all German, not 100% on that), and they are all severed perfectly in every way.  The restaurant itself is an inviting place reminiscent of a German pub, but more open and airy.  They also have outdoor seating on the sidewalk.  We have yet to wait more than a few minutes.  The pub is kid friendly, but be warned that there is not an extensive kids menu, so if you are feeding many kids, it could get expensive.  That being said there are a number of small, medium, and large plate options, so sharing works really well if your kids are a bit adventurous.  There is the Spatzle side if they are not.  I can't imagine going to another German place in town."},{"name":"Mediterranea","address":"332 Ormond St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I only had two dishes.

I can't think of any tub in town that compares for convenience and comfort.  I love sitting out under the stars, or even in the rain, enjoying the bubbles and warmth.  Usually it's not very full (10 or so other people...but the tub is HUGE...25+ feet long), and I am fairly confident the water doesn't contain any floaty ickiness.  There is a decent chance that there is hippy juice and some lotion mixed in the water, but I'm willing to take my chances.  Everyone I bring here becomes an instant addict.  Even filled with other soakers, the tub feels like your own oasis--the splashing of the jets drowns out most of the background noise, and people generally keep to themselves.  I would advise wearing flip flops in the changing room if you're like me and are afraid of foot cooties.  Bring a towel and enjoy.  PS-McMenamins food is nothing special--except the tots.  The school building itself is very cool, and I like the fact that you can eat, sleep, catch a movie, drink (5 bars), soak and watch a concert all in the same place."},{"name":"Mizu Teppanyaki and Sushi","address":"809 Cypress Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Been here a few times.

As most know, I'm a sucker for South East Asian food whether it's Singaporean, Malaysian and sometimes Thai. What drew me in was Khao Mun Ghai, the Thai variant on Hainan Chicken Rice, a rice dish with steamed chicken and wonderful sauces to compliment. \\n\\nI was a little disappointed though. The plate is listed as 14.99, but what was served was a decent serving of rice, but only five pieces of breast meat. Mind you, the breast wasn't dry and in fact was very lovely to eat, but the price point is what kills me a little. Everything tasted wonderfully and I was treated very well but to me for that price, it could've been more. \\n\\nThe other item I ordered was the Thai Green Curry chicken wings. I had 8 wings which was priced around 8$ and it was amazing. It was a very thick coating of curry that had all the wonderful components of heat, acidity and lots of ginger flavor. In hindsight, I probably should've ordered the wings entree which was a plate of wings and a fried rice or noodles entree that comes out to around 9-11$. I wish I had taken a picture, but I was just too hungry to not enjoy my meal. \\n\\nI have been jumping back and forth between giving this establishment a 4 or a 3 because the food tasted amazing.

Ordered some drinks and we put in our appetizer order, got the salmon chips since everyone raved about them, and they were right, they are delicious - a must have for sure!! We later put our food order in, wife got the Brisket, and i decided on the chicken. Once the plates came in we were quite surprised, the portions are huge, we both ended up taking half of both plates home since we just couldn't go through with that much food.

The baked potato I got with it was also delicious and it went well with the fish. It took a little bit for the food to come out but the sheer ambiance and authentic New England decor was enough to pass the time. My mother ordered the haddock and said it was the best she had ever had, my sister who is not a big seafood fan ordered the chicken and was very pleased.

Not because I had any experience with their food, but because my family is somewhat difficult to please in that regard. Additionally, I had shopped for weeks for a caterer who could accommodate our needs on the budget we had allocated for food and Reales had the most reasonable prices by far. \\n\\nNonetheless, the food was truly truly wonderful. Not to mention, I had them deliver it, and their staff was prompt, efficient, and friendly. The only issue I had, was that I had ordered food for 60 ppl and really didn't have enough for the 52 that actualized. I don't know if it was because their food portions are over-estimated or because the attendees came back for seconds and, in some cases, thirds! I enjoyed everything equally but heard repeated raves about their peppers and onions and their marinara sauce (for the party trays). I was asked, so frequently, for the caterers information that I ended up walking from table to table to give the information to the guests. To my surprise, people remarked just as frequently about the salad as they did about the pasta trays. \\n\\nOne suggestion however, if you do have them cater it, they don't provide the serving utensils with the platters.

The bottom ones were filled with broken shells and sand. \\n\\nGrit will be the recurring theme here. There was grit in the clam chowder. And at least 1/3 of my fried clam strips were gritty too. Not pleased at all. \\n\\nOther on entrees include lobster roll and boiled lobster which were both mediocre and overpriced. We have had way better elsewhere. \\n\\nWe complained about the gritty seafood and they took the clam strips off the bill. Still with 4 beers, the bill came to $200 for 4 people for lunch. \\n\\nWhether you're a tourist or local alike, come in and take a peek at the history, but unless they change things up in here, take your wallets and your stomachs elsewhere."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent doughnuts, no matter if during the day or 1:30 AM!!

They gave us sample cups of rice & beans, fried plantain, and fried yuca - all so yummy that we decided we had to have it all! The menu is kind of complicated, as there are so many different combo options you can do. There's a combo with 1/4 chicken plus 2 sides and a drink. I think that was probably the best value at $8 plus some change. The people there were all incredibly nice and accommodating. Now onto the food...\\n\\nThe chicken = Peruvian spiced & slow roasted, moist & tender - outside skin is so savory and good! Definitely heavily seasoned, so maybe a bit much for super sensitive palates, but if you don't like it then you just don't like what they're going for here. It. Is. Awesome. \\n\\nFried plantains = *drool* ...I usually find plantains a little too sweet but these paired great next to the savory spicy chicken. The fried outsides were perfectly caramelized and delicious. \\n\\nBlack beans and rice = Adequately seasoned but not overly so. A good neutral side to accompany the chicken, but not flavorless on it's own by any means. I would happily eat this by itself with some if their green hot sauce (I'll get to that later). \\n\\nMacaroni & cheese = Solid mac & cheese. Good flavor, good texture. I liked that it wasn't too thick and it didn't get pasty as it cooled like some other mac & cheese does.\\n\\nFried Yuca = A new kind of French fries... YUM! Caution, these are addictive. Perfect crispy outsides, dense fluffy insides, like a potato on crack. Sooo good! \\n\\nGreen hot sauce = I'm not sure how they make this stuff, but it is HOT! I love hot stuff, so it was great for me. I was dipping chicken and Yuca fries in it like there was no tomorrow. \\n\\nWhite dressing sauce = Not sure how they made this one either.

I'd been here before strictly for drinks with friends and loved the atmosphere but my first dining experience was less than stellar.\\n\\nHighlights and low lights:\\n\\n- Nice overall atmosphere. Good jazz/ blues live music; nice big open area; nice lighting; fun little patio area; good service\\n- Food: Had the signature smoked salmon chips appetizer. Those were good; had the calamari appetizer, really enjoyed that; had the scallops entree, really enjoyed that. (Actually had a few bites of a friends.) What I didn't like was the NY Strip that I ordered. For $30 I expected a much better product. For starters I ordered mine Med Rare and it came out Med Well. Yes yes I know I should have sent it back but we had already been there for awhile and I was ready to eat and had somewhere to go after. But anyway, this had to be one of the toughest strips I'd ever had. Now before you come at me about this steak, I know my steaks. And I know that it traditionally has a firm texture because of tight, even grain. And I ALSO know that if it had been dry aged versus wet aged (due to dry aging takes much longer) that it would have been more tender. But the bottom line is this was just simply a very tough cut for a strip. I don't know if TUL get's their steaks from the same distributor or if they have to switch it up from time to time, but whatever day mine came in and from whomever, they need to let these people know. This was Tues, July 15th at about 6:30 PM.\\n\\nThough the service from a general service perspective was very good, I felt that the server might had noticed that 60% of my steak was left and that it was obvious I had cut into different areas as I was searching for the Med Rare tenderness I had hoped for. \\n\\nFYI for those of you reading into things; I have 6 years experience working in a restaurant and know what to expect and not to expect. Furthermore, I never ever accept a free meal so that's not what I was looking for either. I just wanted simple acknowledgement that perhaps I wasn't satisfied with the entree so that they could relay the information to the Chef.\\n\\nEither way, the atmosphere, drinks and other items will make me want to go back, but I will not be ordering the NY Strip from them again.\\n\\nOh and I almost forgot, the seats are not too comfortable.

You won't get disappointed.  \\nOr worse, if you want to feel like an idiot,  suggest this place to some foodies and line up for a hour with them before a sad dinning experience.  You will feel like a winner. \\n\\nThat was story of my life with Ask for Luigi,  in July 2016. \\n\\nAfter reading all the excellent reviews, and seeing the photos of long line ups, I suggested this place to some international traveller- foodies. Mistake. \\n\\nThe house wine tasted off and sour. We had a average appetitzer, portion was not proportion to the price.  Duck ragu pasta was a disaster. The pasta was not al dente. The duck meat was tough and dry.  Salt is the only flavour I could remember.  Where is the supposedly homey flavour of well cooked tomato sauce aka sugo, delicate herbs or the tender succulent ground duck meat. Because of the flavour and the texture of the meat, I suspect that they did not give sufficient time to cook the duck ragu. Worse, I suspect they watered down the sugo.   Sad. \\n\\nThe vegetarian pasta was a disappointment.  The pasta tasted oddly tasteless and texture was strange. It was like the kitchen forgot to put salt in the boiling water when they cooked the pasta. The vegetable was soggy and mushy, without a hint of freshness. You would think this is a vegetarian dish, it is light so I should be able to smell the earthy aroma of good quality olive oil. No, sorry. I suspect they use canola oil. All in all, this dish is a kill joy, It looked and tasted like Asian leftover stir fry summer squash on a bed of short mediocre pasta. \\n\\nWe knew the dinner sucked.  I felt so embarrassed to have blindly believed the 5 stars reviews and recommended this place to my friends. Lesson learned. There is a big difference between hype and substance.  If it is a dicey pasta joint, you see mostly Anglo or Asian eating at the tables, then it is better to find another place. Or better, invite yourself to your italian friends' home for real pasta experience. \\n\\nI tried better, such as Tarrazza, Qusto di Quatro or Lombardo'. \\nI ate the real stuff too in Italy.

The Bianca came covered in a mound of arugula. It was like having a salad with your slice and a bit of an adventure to eat. Still, I liked the peppery taste of all that arugula. The Roasted Mushroom probably beat out the Bianca though just because I love mushrooms and they didn't skimp on them. \\n\\nFor dessert we tried out the banana tiramisu - it came in a very small mason jar - and the banana added a nice, new flavor. \\n\\nI must warn that the restaurant uses a lot of oil in their dishes so this isn't necessarily the healthiest.

There I was, in a somewhat shady part of town, fighting to get in on a Friday afternoon, and standing there with about a dozen people, some with cameras. The place is dark and messy, very unkempt. I guess with all the cash (and they ONLY take cash) they bring in for essentially junk food they couldnt be bothered with renovating the place, expanding the space, knocking down a wall or two, replace some windows, etc., well because  that would be too customer friendly and this place doesn't want to admit that it really has a following. And why would that be a bad thing?\\n\\nI mean, I am not really complaining. Clearly people are here because they want to see and have wicked donuts, not just because they want to eat donuts. They're here for the Captain Crunch ones, the ones with the pretzel stick sticking out of the chest (the Double Voodoo) that is also dipped in chocolate, or the other show-stopper, the one with bacon inside it. I suppose when people tire of this, they'll move on to the next fad.

They are even on a rotating glass display so you can point to what you want before you order. I wish the menu in black were not so hard to read, but again, let's file this under the \\"customer friendly\\" experience category. In any case, the donuts are leaden, heavy blocks of fried dough or course. There is little that is nutritious of course (duh), but the flavor just isn't there, or it isn't necessarily different.

This was a win.\\n-Mango guava jelly: fun salty tang on top paired with the unique guava jelly.

Being a native Bostonian, I avoid touristy places like it's my job, but my boyfriend recently moved to the city from Colorado and has this thing for going to the highest point in any given place, so we went to Top of the Hub so he could satisfy that urge and took some friends along with us.\\n\\nWe were dressed casually so mildly worried that we would be turned away, but no one seemed to care that I was in my t-shirt and jeans from work, and waited around for our waiter, who turned up about 10 minutes later. He was nice if appearing to be more interested in serving the table next to us. It wasn't enough to be bothersome, though. We ordered cocktails which struck me as overpriced but were tasty nonetheless. I didn't try my companions' drinks, but mine was the Hendrick's Gin Fizz, which I recommend trying unless you're not a fan of gin.\\n\\nThe calamari we shared was actually quite good, one of the better preparations I can recall having. I then had the Valrhona chocolate cake, which was sort of strange in that it would have been disappointing if not for the Valrhona milk chocolate. My companion said the clam chowder was pretty good, and the open-faced salmon sandwich was also tasty if slightly overdone. Very well seasoned, though, and the dill sauce was great.\\n\\nI suppose I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that Top of the Hub would be a three-star establishment if not for the incredible view. It's worth going once for that alone. Also - their food is not especially expensive nor is it especially good (though it's certainly not bad, just middle-of-the-road). We discussed it a bit over our drinks and came to the conclusion that Top of the Hub both relies on its view and reputation as well as makes its money on alcohol. The specialty cocktails are $13-15 apiece, and even a simple vodka cranberry will set you back $10. Where they truly make their money is the $600 bottles of wine and $75-per-serving Macallan 25 year. (Tip: you can get an entire bottle of Macallan 25 year for not too much more than Top of the Hub sells a single snifter for.)\\n\\nIn summary: if you're looking for a place that has incredible food, go somewhere else, but if you're looking for the view and are interested in ponying up for wine and liquor, you'll like it here."},{"name":"Pho 99","address":"99 Pleasant St","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"Delivery man is very rude.

Voodoo has very interesting choices (see all pictures by other yelpers for reference) I ended up bringing these back home for everyone to try since it was the more gifty one. 4 stars for creativity  and overall experience with these."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to top of the hub with my boyfriend for a last date before he goes to college and it was absolutely perfect!

They offered another wine list from the restaurant next store which was even more mundane then the first. Then they offered to have the Sommelier to come over to speak with me. What a joke, here I am just wanting to get on with our evening spending all this time just trying to figure out what they have or do not have on the wine list. Then they offer to send over the person who stocks the wine. Really? No thanks. It never should have gotten that far. A Sommelier or Manager (a good one perhaps) would have been at the table as soon as it was discover they didn't have that very first bottle. I ended up just ordering something as the food was coming. Can't remember what it was... it wasn't particularly good or bad. I do however remember the food, every dish we ordered was poorly conceived and badly executed. From flavor to textures it was just bad. As it turns out Leaf is actually a part of the Mexican place next store called Aji. We asked how is it they can offer the wine list from next store and we were told it (Leaf) is overflow and private dinning for the Mexican restaurant.

This is not a commentary on my drinking habits; rather I am simply expressing the fact that I have eaten here...a lot.  And with such a large number of visits comes a certain nostalgia that extends beyond the food itself.  I am going to try to be as objective as possible, but you should know up front that this is a 5-star pizza place in my book - and I think most Austin natives would agree.  \\n\\nHome Slice serves good, simple, greasy, New York-style pizza.  You won't be blown away by the specialty pies here - as much as I love the sausage, ricotta, and roasted red pepper pizza, it requires a fair amount of red pepper flakes and oregano to really spark the taste buds.  If you want to experience more eclectic toppings, I would recommend Mellow Mushroom or East Side Pies.\\n\\nOrder a large one-topping pizza (easily split 4 ways) and you will not be disappointed.  The sauce is the right blend of herbs and spices.  With each bite the cheese manages to pull away from the pizza without dragging the rest of the toppings along with it.  The crust remains crispy on bottom and at the ends.  What it lacks in innovation, Home Slice makes up for in basic execution.  And in my experience it has been surprisingly difficult to find a pizza place that consistently makes good pizza.\\n\\nOn a quick side note: If all the inside seating is taken, grab a few beers along with your pizza and take a seat on the curb out front - SoCo on Thursday night is probably the best people-watching in Austin."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Steve the GM was absolutely amazing!

I have not given it five stars because the inside seating is in a veritable echo chamber. When the place is crowded with energetic folks who don't think twice about talking and laughing at the top of their lungs, you cannot hear your waiter, you cannot hear the person across the small table from you, and you cannot hear yourself think.

For appetizers we got the beet ravioli which was very tasty, albeit very bit sized.\\n\\nA few things I would like to mention to hopefully help make the next visit a little better.  First, the bussers/server assistants were a little too quick on the draw as far as clearing the table.  For example, if my bread plate still has half a roll on it, don't just assume that I am done with it.  At least ask if it is ok to take my plate.  During appetizers/salad I had to be careful not to put down my fork because you very much got the sense that they would pounce to clear the table - even with nothing waiting in the window.\\n\\nLike, I get service, but situations need to be read a little better.  I had JUST buttered my roll, and placed it down on the little dish while our waitress was taking our order.  The guy just comes over and takes the plate right off the table as I am mid sentence ordering.  Like, no, I wasn't done. For a $200 meal for two people, should be a little better than that.\\n\\nI must say that I was not overly impressed with the sides.  The two we chose was the polenta along with the rosemary french fries.  I am a huge polenta fan, but this was unfortunately not edible.  It tasted as though someone dumped a whole container of salt into it.  Ocean water like.  So much that the salt was stronger than the truffle oil.  Took home leftovers, thinking the taste might settle, but still very overpowering, where I had to throw the side out.\\n\\nThe rosemary french fries were a bit misleading.  It was a bag of run of the mill fastfood-esque fries, with a little rosemary twig on top.  No special seasoning or anything to them really.\\n\\nDesert was a delicious banana foster sunday.\\n\\nSo overall, would definitely go back, just think that service aspect needs to be improved, as well as the sides could be stepped up."},{"name":"Anis Cafe & Bistro","address":"2974 Grandview Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers and everyone raved about their meals.

The onion rings were better than the fries, but they were too huge and the batter was too thick. The batter was very tasty at first, but after a couple, it got too salty. The onion rings were also drenched in oil - one ring soaked through 3 napkins. I know this is a burger place and I should not be surprised to see oil with fried food, but this was way too much.

The only reason they get 4 stars and not 5 (and it kills me to do it) is just because I think they've outgrown their location.

And so we fulfilled our civic duty. \\n\\n***BACON MAPLE BAR - Raised yeast doughnut with maple frosting and bacon on top\\n\\nStunningly average, just your standard maple bar with a strip of bacon on top. And not that crispy oily \\"I could bite the you into a million pieces\\" type, but a dull, flat, thick, & chewy variety. As if they gave each other high fives for barely fulfilling the quota to \\"Keep Portland Weird\\".\\n\\n***PORTLAND CREAM - Raised yeast doughnut filled with Bavarian cream with chocolate on the top and two eyeballs\\n\\nAllegedly the official doughnut of Portland, I couldn't have been more bored. This was just about the most nondescript doughnut ever, pedestrian dough, a bit of standard chocolate glaze on top, and filled with an odd, almost clear, water-soluble solution that cried \\"Contains no actual milk solids\\". \\n\\n***MEMPHIS MAFIA - Fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon sugar covered in a glaze with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips on top\\n\\nThis was the closest thing to approachable that we tried--I could taste a bit of banana essence in the dough, and the chocolate and peanut butter combo on top had potential, but in the end the heaviness of this beast became the millstone around its neck. \\n\\n***OLD DIRTY BASTARD - Raised yeast doughnut with chocolate frosting, Oreos, and peanut butter\\n\\nBasically the same as the above, but with no banana flavor, and Oreo chunks on top. \\n\\nALL IN ALL:\\n\\nThe very best experiences I've had with doughnuts have involved eating them fresh out of the oven--this seems to magnify the deliciousness of even the most average doughnut. Unfortunately this isn't the rule of law around Voodoo Doughnuts, where doughnuts are served slightly chilled. And as the prime marker of a doughnut is its unhealthiness, it becomes incumbent upon the chef to disguise her creations with a light fluffiness--this is where Voodoo fails, for the meatiness of half of one of its doughnuts could choke a cow. It's not something where you could gobble three or four down and feel guilty about it--two bites in and you're in the depths of hell, longing for a raw carrot and an enema."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"Stumbled across this gem on our way from the airport.

Please do yourself a favour and try to make it to a Panahar lunch buffet ASAP. That day, they had the chicken rezala, which is a Bengali dish similar to a chicken curry.

The oyster bar looked really cool though we opted for seated service in the main dining room.  The food here is as good as the reviews say it is.  The bread at the start, the hushpuppies (beignet-style), etc., it was all very good.  It gets a 3 because it's dramatically overpriced for what you get and nothing we had was \\"knock your socks off\\" good -- which could have potentially justified the steep prices.  Upwards of $3.50 per oyster is just way too much money.  Also, most of the fish dishes are served a la carte and although they are prepared simply and executed properly, the dishes don't have any \\"wow\\" aspects to them.  Again, it's very good food, but when you end up spending $9 for the gumbo or she-crab soup, or $9 each for one of their side dishes to accompany the a la carte fish, the bill adds up quickly and unnecessarily as compared to other quality seafood options out there.  If you're not serving side dishes with it, I can't possibly justify more than $18-$22 for a lone grilled piece of fish (rather than the $28 price tag of the swordfish).  A few dollars per dish doesn't seem like much, but that's 25% more than it should be and it adds up quick when you have to order multiple items to complete the meal!  If they bring their prices down by 20% or so, my rating would immediately jump.  Until then, I'll get my oyster fix at Steamhouse or Fontaines', and I'll buy my fish from the likes of Fresh Market and cook it myself.  \\n\\nSeveral tables positioned toward the middle of the restaurant, including ours, were packed too tightly together.

The fried chicken dish was good but nothing special. The lobster fried rice at $32 was disappointing. I'll grant that I was quite impressed by the freshness and choice of veggies that they used. And the portion is generous. But there was like no lobster flavor in this lobster fried rice! This despite the whole lobster tail that came with it. I couldn't detect any lobster flavor in the rice if there was any, and the way that the lobster tail was prepared, while it made for an interesting appearance, stripped the lobster of any of that delicious lobster taste one anticipates from eating lobster. (I'm from the Northeast, where we boil/steam our lobsters and that preserves the plumpness and mouth-watering lobster goodness. Even stir-frying, as many Asian restaurants tend to do, help to preserve the flavor.). Overall, the lobster fried rice is good, just not $32 good, especially since the eponymous lobster could barely be tasted.\\n\\nNow the surprising standout of the evening was ... the PHO COCKTAIL(!!!), which our server described as \\"tasting like pho but without the meat.\\" We were intrigued by the name, ingredients (gin, cilantro, spices, ginger), and our waitress's description, so we ordered one.

Two young gentlemen (employees) were bantering back and forth, not noticing us. So I said hello, we were asked if we wanted lunch or dinner, stated dinner, and were sent upstairs, where we were seated across from the Kennedy booth; cool, we had never seen it before despite having been here 3-4 times now. We were the only ones upstairs at that point in time.\\n\\nAfter that, we waited, and waited, a family got seated at the Kennedy booth (roughly 15 minutes later), and then finally a server came by (guessing we were forgotten, despite another server talking to the bartender which is right behind the Kennedy booth). No matter! It will be time to eat soon!\\n\\nWe waited, and waited, probably another good 30 minutes, until our food came. My wife got fish and chips and I got the seafood platter, so not sure what took so long. Fish and chips were fine, but my food was bland. It amounted to various different fish and shellfish all broiled with a lemon wedge and three red potatoes in about an inch of butter/water. Uh... this isn't the Union Oyster quality that I had experienced before... what gives? We didn't get a single refill, nor were we asked if our food was to our liking until the end.\\n\\nSo we finish our meal and are ready to just leave. We hand the server a $75 gift card, plus our credit card to add some tip (bill came out to $68 and change) and she comes back having run our credit for $44. Huh? Again, we wait, and wait, to flag her down, and she states the gift card was for $25. Honest mistake, right? So we tell her no, it was $75, she goes to check, and sure enough we are right. \\"So what do you want me to do?\\", she asks. Well, refund the money? Charge another $5 for tip? \\"Oh, we can only run $10 minimum\\"... Uh, ok, this is your screw up, the service was God Awful, and now I am forced to give you a higher tip? Whatever, just run it.\\n\\nAfter about three days the $44 was refunded and the $10 was withdrawn. Server got over a 20% tip for treating us slightly better than dirt, which is the thing that makes me the most upset about this experience.\\n\\nWill we be back? Yes. But if service starts out as bad as it did this day we are walking right out. I am not the kind of person that expects to be pampered at a restaurant, but when dropping $70+ on two plates of mediocre (it was only mediocre tonight, mind you) seafood, I do expect to have some contact with the server.

We tend to banter with our servers whenever we go out, and the two we've had were able to keep up with the conversation and didn't seem rushed to engage in a quick conversation, despite how busy their section was.\\n\\n- Details are important.

Although I've never been disappointed, Saturday things felt a bit off.\\nIt started with a waitress without a sense of humor.

Man, this shake is pretty yummy.  (I got the Very Berry, which is usually strawberry ice cream with absinthe. However, they were running a bit low on the absinthe, so they asked if I wanted raspberry vodka instead.  Yes please!  :)   \\n\\nThey don't cook their burgers to order.  All burgers are cooked at the medium level.  I usually like mine medium rare.  But no matter... The double cheeseburger I had was very juicy.

And I don't even like beets.  \\n\\nIn addition, the girls that worked the counter were splendid!!  Very friendly with enthusiastic smiles.  They even let me go behind their counter to wash my hands as I had been working out in Jamaica Pond Park, and being two notches below OCD level of washing my hands (but if I'm touching food with my fingers...) and as they don't have a bathroom, that was really appreciated.

It's clean and modern. \\n\\nMy friends and I hiked at El Dorado and were ready for a hearty lunch. We were walking around as I was looking at my Yelp app. I had read about Leaf before when my husband and I were in Boulder. I figured this was a perfect chance to try out a place I've been wanting to go to. I suggested it and both friends thought it sounded good. \\n\\nWe got a table back in the corner, so we had full view of the entire restaurant. Now came the hardest part: deciding what to eat. We all like to share food so we can try different dishes. The appetizers didn't jump out at us, but the Falafel Pita sounded like a great dish to share. Why not order a sandwich with the sweet potato fries so we can all try it? This was, by far, the best dish we ordered! I don't even know how to describe it. Well-seasoned. Creamy hummus. Crisp veggies. Warm, soft pita. The sweet potato fries are probably the best sweet potato fries I have ever eaten. \\n\\nFor our main dishes, here's what we ordered:\\n\\nVegan alfredo - loaded with veggies. Creamy sauce. It wasn't quite alfredo, but was a great alternative. I'm sure it was much healthier than regular alfredo sauce. This was a friend's dish, but I totally would order this for myself, if I'm in the mood for pasta.\\nMushroom Burger - my other friend ordered this. I wish I had ordered it though. I was expecting a giant portabello mushroom cap, but it was actually ground up and formed into a patty. I just loved it. \\nBlackened Tofu & Veggie Sandwich - this was the dish I ordered. I like tofu. It takes the flavor of whatever you put on it. It was actually pretty spicy (duh - blackened). I should have known when I bit into it that there would be a kick. I enjoyed it. Lots of crisp, fresh veggies. Whole wheat bread. I tried the soup of the day (can't remember what it was for the life of me). It was just ok though. I may have been getting full too. I left half of the cup. \\n\\nMy friends stayed with us for an entire week, so as a thank you gift, they bought us a $30 gift card so my husband and I can go back! What a pleasant surprise! Can't want to take my hubby there to experience the incredible vegetarian cuisine. And we might try one (or two) of their delectable-looking desserts.

My wife tried the chicken pot pie and I had their haddock Rockefeller.  Both were very good and very filling. The chicken in the pot pie was pulled-pork consistency and very flavorful ( I couldn't resist stealing a bite or two). The pastry pie on top was like a croissant.  \\n\\nThe haddock was also good, but could have used a touch less Gruyere. The cheese overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the fish. Also, I don't usually expect to have to skin my haddock filet when I eat it; I expect a perfectly filleted filet for the price I paid. In this case, there was about 3 square inches of skin left on the filet, so I don't think it was an intentional cooking decision. Having eaten haddock at places like the Barnacle in Marblehead, which is a far cheaper venue, I expect a fancy place like this to have at least the same standards as the barnacle. \\n\\nThe view: duh!...It's amazing.

Lol the asthetics of this cafe are very appealing to the eye; nice color scheme, interesting eye catching decor, and spacious. The selections of pastries are appetizing and visually appealing as well. Being I'm familiar with French pastries the uglier it is the better it tastes. The French don't use a lot of sugar in their pastries in my opinion. The guests, my bestie, and myself were waiting for the rest of the patrons of the party to arrive, yes our little birthday girl was fashionably late. But Amelie's offered a warm, welcoming, and asthetically pleasing enviroment so the wait wasn't a pain. We had tea and caught up on tea. I was on the fence of ordering gunpowder and Paris tea; I started off with Paris which was enveloped with notes vanilla, I used sugar in the raw and added a bit of cream. The tea was velvety and devine! I went back for a 2nd cup and tried the gun powder; it had undertones of citrus with a unfamiliar notes, it was very aromatic and tasty. Kind of like a milder earl gray. I also ordered the salted caramel brownie; it was small but very decadent!! I couldn't finish the whole thing, if you have a sweet tooth this place is diffinitely for you. The customer service was friendly and inviting; the young lady that helped me was very knowledgeable and explained the various teas to me. I tried her 2 suggestions and was pleased with both! My bestie had an issue with her hot chocolate but they happily exchanged it and she tried the gunpowder tea. She was happy with my suggestion. My bestie said the bathrooms were tidy and clean.

So I'm thinking for almost four times more for a half of bird this shit must be epic. Nope.  Unbelievable, nope. Outstanding not even close. The bird was not the word.  Does not hold a candle to EATS. I don't know how they cooked it. But after it was cooked it was drizzled with some kind of sweet sauce. But not to be  glaze... just as an afterthought. What I was tasting had me perplexed. Like why is my chicken wet and it not a wing? It just wasn't the business. In no shape or form. Now my wife loved her food. She did not go into the specifics of the meal. But by all accounts she was thoroughly satisfied. Me on the other hand, left the restaurant with a wet half a chicken and some cheese and mac. In that order. I would go back for a beer and the salmon chips. I feel the entries should be priced in the $12-17 range. A bit over price for what I consumed. Tab $122, I just don't feel like I got all money's worth."},{"name":"Mae Ploy Thai Cuisine","address":"2531 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Run of the mill Thai food.

I'm a big fan of the pretzel bun. One of the few places that actually cooks my burger the way I order it. I always order medium rare and at most places receive a burger that is well-done but that usually doesn't happen here. If you like cream cheese they have a few options for it and you should seriously try it. I don't know why it's not more common to put cream cheese on a burger because it is delicious! \\n\\nThe Truffle fries with red pepper aioli are phenomenal and you need to get them. On Wednesday nights they also have a happy hour list and I typically splurge on their $5 Dirty Martini. \\n\\nThe last time we went we also tried their pretzel bites. For $7 it basically came down to $1 a bite. They were small bites and the cheese sauce was runny and nothing special. Because we had so few bites we ended up with a huge bowl of watery cheese sauce that we couldn't use.

Mind you, as a purist, I'm reviewing only the plain cheese slice.\\n\\nThe part most places tend to botch is the crust.  This is the case with Little Deli up north.  In their case, its as though they're catering to market demands here in Austin, perhaps the complaint that a truly thin crust pizza is not filling enough, and so they don't have the guts to go super floppy thin, and while their sauce and cheese are decent, the crust ruins it.  But Home Slice is actually pretty accurate.  It gets the thin, charred crust just right, with a simple earthy sauce.  For anyone who has lived in the City, I believe it most closely resembles Joe's near 4th and Bleeker.

Colloquialisms aside, I too wanted to like this place, but found it lacking. Lacking in service and lacking in food quality. I go out to eat for three reasons: 1) I'm lazy and want to be served, 2) to visit with friends, 3) to eat something I cannot make at home. This place satisfied none of my restaurant needs. The waitress was cool, and brought my friend the wrong drink. Rather than apologize, she brought him his first choice, but charged him for both. Really? Strike one. Then, we ate outside, and there were bees everywhere because of the marmalade pots on each table. Now, having worked in an outdoor restaurant setting myself, I realize that a certain number of pests are unavoidable, but bees don't have to be one of them. Bees like sugar - take the sugar away, and the bees will seek it elsewhere. Would it really kill you to bring the marmalade out to each table and remove it once that table is finished? Or better yet, ASK the table whether they even WANT marmalade, and possibly save yourself the trip. As it was, we spent a good part of our meal fighting little flying buggars. \\nFinally, the food was disappointing. I had a mediocre waffle, while my friends had an assortment of bland bagels and wilty salad.This was the kiss of death for this place - I left as hungry as I had arrived.  Then to top it off, I thought the bill was pretty steep for bistro fare. The only reason they get two stars is the location is cool, and their coffee is good. I may try it again, but will definitely dine inside next time.\\n\\n::Update:: I think it's only fair that I let everyone know that someone from the Blue Dahlia contacted me about my review and told me about specific actions they're taking to improve their service. That shows good PR in my book. I appreciate restaurants that aren't too proud to admit they need improvement.

However, my dish, the kung pao tofu, was bland and the yellowtail sushi was not especially flavorful or appealing either.  To me, a fusion restaurant like this that has the diversity of Japanese, Chinese, and Thai dishes doesn't do any of them particularly well and can't be expected to be authentic.  That is kind of a prejudice, but I think R Rice bears it out.

The flavor of the dish was deep and rich, and there was just the right amount of spice (I can't eat spicy things, so it was the perfect amount that gives a nice kick but is not overwhelming). This is also large enough that one person could order it as a (very filling) entree. \\n\\nThe ahi tuna and the lobster mac were both very, very good. The foie gras and the kangaroo were nothing special. Neither of us had ever tried kangaroo, so we thought, \\"When in Rome...\\" I found it to be bland and chewy and feel no need to ever order kangaroo again. The foie gras was actually a bit disappointing.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Godiva dark chocolate terrine. Holy cow. Just imagine eating a hunk of dark chocolate ganache that's the size of a slice of meatloaf. And the best part was that there were TWO slices on the plate, so the boyfriend and I each got one and didn't feel as though we were sharing. \\n\\nOverall, we had an incredibly enjoyable visit. We're not from the area, but if we were, we would probably make this a regular date night spot."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Of the handful of times we have been here we have never had a bad meal.

Went to the place after moving to OR a month ago from San Diego, CA (where Mexican cuisine is a way of life!) after desperately searching yelp for a good Mexican food joint in Beaverton and ran across this place. It was better than I expected and bonus--- unlike that nasty ass Taco Time that runs rampant in the Northwest... this place actually has actual Mexican people in the kitchen & hosting-- my #1 cue that the food is going to be authentically delicious! (No offense Becky, Kim Ho or Kiesha but I only trust Maria when it comes to home made tortillas!) The ambiance :casual family dining with festive decor. The bean dip and salsa with chips... soo yum!! Was almost full of it before my dinner even came. The wait staff: very friendly and attentive. The hostess: to be honest she wasn't a 5 star chick. I give her maybe 3. She seemed a little hmmm overworked?? She was a little pushy with people, zero patience so much so it almost made you uncomfortable to watch her with customers but then you only have to deal with her for about 60 seconds before you are seated. But my 5 star is definitely for the food. The Tortilla Soup is soo good!! I was in Mexico just 6 weeks ago-- as I often was living in San Diego, and I am accustomed to eating the cuisine this one tasted homemade and the \\"small\\" in most places would be considered the \\"large\\". The chips, tortillas, beans guacamole--- just about every staple was excellent. Prices were good for a restaurant; not as good as a Mexican \\"taco shop\\" back home but you're paying for the table and wait staff. They have Americanized-- or shall I say Oregonized some things as most restaurants tend to do to accommodate a less than ethnic customer base but asking for items of choice in Spanish they understand and comply. The portions are awesome, I always go home with left overs and can eat 2-3 meals from any menu choice. There's a bar inside which I have not been in but often see a few people in enjoying beer and margaritas. They have a sign saying they have the Best Margaritas... I will be the judge of that soon enough! ;) Awesome place, I will be back many many times if for nothing else... the beans & tortilla soup."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh... \\n\\nVoodoo is all about the image.

The flavor profile on this dish was spectacular.  For the grilled octopus, the tenderness the chef achieved was the main point of praise.  It was as tender as shrimp.  The only technique I can think of would be poaching or sou vide, which are both high end techniques to achieve a certain texture in foods.  \\n\\nThe wait staff also deserves some praise for being very knowledgeable and professional.

I looked forward to coming here based on the yelp reviews but gotta admit I don't understand the great reviews or the packed dining room.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our table, we got off to a good start in the bar. I asked for two glasses of a dry red from a bottle that hadn't been sitting around too long, and the guy opens a new bottle for us... well done. But it was mostly downhill from there, unfortunately. I suspected trouble while perusing the menu, pointing out her chicken picatta dish came paired with a side of marinara pasta. WTF? Shouldn't the pasta alongside a picatta swim in the entree sauce? Likewise, my chosen veal Saltimbocca came with fettucine alfredo. She makes the wise choice of ordering plain pasta as a sub. I stick with the alfredo to see if our judgment isn't too hasty.\\n\\nIt wasn't. After wading through a caprese appetizer, which featured burnt toast, our entrees arrived on school cafeteria grade plates that reminded me that we were indeed dining at a family-style restaurant. Her picatta was actually pretty good, and the dry pasta that arrived in an institutional-style bowl was the best thing that could have happened to it. Mixing the picatta sauce with a side of marinara seems as much of a mismatch as pairing a grilled ribeye with a pinot grigio. My Veal Saltimbocca was perfectly okay, but was ultimately just a thin, flat piece of meat served on a cafeteria-sytle plate. I realize veal cut / pounded flat is to be expected in this type of dish, but memories of middle school lunch predominated, with only the wine helping quell that mental image. Again, the pasta should have been happy with the sauce from the entree, but that's not how they roll here. The alfredo was bland and clashed with the entree sauce only less mildly than I imagine a picatta/marinara combo would.\\n\\nI'm not sure why we ordered dessert, but we did. The cheesecake was completely and immediately forgettable but the cannoli was pretty good. Crap-tons of orange zest, or, more likely, some imitation orange zest flavoring (more pleasantly intense than orange liqueur would likely allow) made it seem pretty nice.\\n\\nThe cannoli was a hit but not enough to rescue the evening. I have no idea why this place is so popular. Except for the burnt toasted bread on the caprese, nothing was actively bad, but the odd menu pairings, the school cafeteria-style dishware and the family-style suburban crowd did nothing to endear. For me, there are other Italian comfort food options out there that cost at least a buck or two less per item and don't involve a wait to sit next to a table of noisy kids. The variety and quality may be a tiny notch less at other cheap Italian joints, but the menu pairings more sensible and the atmosphere less hustle-bustle and more intimate, relaxed and pleasant.\\n\\nBased on plenty of glowing reviews of Reale, though, your mileage may vary."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went there as part of the Portland Dining month.

This place is the REAL reason I can be found in Portland as often as I am (don't tell my boss).

Primary ingredients are habanero infused vodka and passion fruit and it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face\\n\\n- complimentary bread comes with three dipping sauces: a spicy green jalapeno based, medium passionfruit (I order extra of this one) and a mild peanut based.  Gluten-free substitute for the bread is available, we ordered this for the first time and it turned out to be deep-fried Yuca sticks.  I stuck with the bread, but if you mind gluten more than deep-fry, it is an option...\\n\\n- order a selection of tapas: we usually get 4-5 small ones to share for 2 which is plenty.  Recommend the crab stuffed avocado and the beef heart kabobs most of all, but we've been rotating through these and never had a bad selection.  We had a salmon sashimi special that was partly acid cooked in passion fruit juice (okay, so I have a thing for passion fruit) and came with a watermelon/cucumber salad that was delish!\\n\\n- Chocolate Andina will send chocolate lovers right over the top.

He was happy with the meal. \\n\\nOverall: food was good (not overly amazing), service was quick and friendly, prices a bit high, and portions were modest.

Don't hate me, but I think it was overhyped for me though! ): I really wanted to like it, but I just wasn't too impressed with it. I've had my fair share of bomb donut places in LA and I didn't really think it came close to it.  This is definitely a place that you try once just to say you've tried it, but I would not be a regular here if I lived here. Nice presentation of donuts displayed on spinning displays though! Really fun and cute!\\n\\nJust a note, CASH ONLY. \\n\\n\\nTEX-ASS CHALLENGE: This is a fun challenge. I came with friends and you know there's always that ONE friend that's willing to go for it haha! You have 80 seconds to finish this huge giant glazed donut. It's huge...pictures don't give it justice. It's equivalent to 6 regular sized donuts. If you eat it all by 80 seconds, it's free. If not, you'll have to pay for it haha. The lady who conducted the challenge didn't the most animated, but other servers did. They even rang a cowbell and shouted words of encouragement/ridicule to raise attention. Our guy friend almost gagged haha, but he only got through 2/3 of the donut. Fun thing to try though. \\n\\n\\nVOODOO DOZEN: Since I came with five others, we decided it was worth it to get this. The voodoo dozen is perfect for tourists (like us) that wanted to try 13 of their most popular donuts. I think it was about $24 dollars. Of the ones we bought, I was able to take bites from most of them and these are the ones I tried:\\n\\n-VOODOO DOLL: I was told that you're supposed to move the pretzel around and the raspberry filling inside the donut is supposed to ooze out. Didn't happen haha. Not a raspberry filling person, so this was a miss for me. \\n \\n-BACON MAPLE BAR: I love maple bacon bars!! So this one met my standards (: I'd get this again. \\n\\n-OLD DIRTY BASTARD: Loved this one! This donut came with chocolate frosting, crushed oreos, and peanut butter. If you love the traditional chocolate and peanut butter combo, this will win you over. I'd get this again, but definitely share because it's on the sweet side. \\n \\n-PORTLAND CREAM: A donut filled with Bavarian cream. The cream tasted like a light custard. It was whatevers to me. \\n\\n-CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN: Donut with an overly sweet frosting and stale captain crunch. No thanks. \\n\\n-TRIPLE CHOCOLATE PENETRATION: Chocolate donut with overly sweet frosting and stale coco puff cereal on top. No thanks again. \\n\\n-DIRT: Donut with an overly sweet vanilla and crushed oreos on top. SUPER sweet, but it tasted as I expected it to.\\n\\n-MARSHALL MATHERS: A very cake-y textured donut with vanilla frosting and covered with mini m&m's. Not my personal taste. \\n\\n-NEAPOLITAN: This chocolate cake-y textured donut with vanilla frosting, strawberry dust, and marshmallows.\\n\\nThe remaining one I didn't taste were GRAPE APE, DIABLOS REX, MAPLE BLAZER BLUNT, & MCMINNVILLE CREAM."},{"name":"Uncle Maddio's Pizza Joint","address":"1544 Piedmont Ave NE, Ste 219","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Service was TERRIBLE...

When I was there however, the bathrooms were not working and I had to wait 30 minutes just to use the restroom which was really inconvenient considering there were people everywhere still waiting to be seated. Sundays in my opinion are the worst days to go. Folks are getting out of church and going straight there for lunch. And then you have the brunch crowd and they're always hangry. Mary Mac's staff is kind of a hit or miss.

I haven't been there in person yet, so all I can say about the service is, they assembled our large order surprisingly quickly, and with no problems.\\n\\nThe baked garlic parmesan sweet potato fries were definitely good, and their crispiness survived nicely in the delivery container!\\n\\nUnfried buffalo chicken strips with farmhouse pickles - loved both! The chicken kept some nice crunch despite being coated in a tasty hot sauce, spicy and resembling Cholula but not that hot and with some sweet smokey notes. The pickles accompanied them nicely and I am always glad to find ways to get more fermented foods into my diet\\n\\nI enjoyed the balance of subtle flavors in their kale caesar salad. The bread crumbs are an interesting addition and really liked what they contributed to the overall texture. I only used about half of the cup of bread crumbs they gave us and it was plenty to play its role without being overwhelming.\\n\\nThe grass-fed steak and potatoes were quite enjoyable. The serving size was a sensibly healthy-sized serving and big enough to be satisfying (but small if you were expecting a huge steak). Perfectly cooked to order. The flavoring was very good, same goes for the potatoes, tomatoes and onions that came with it. \\n\\nMy partner got Art's Unfried Chicken with brussel sprouts. He is picky but finished all of this and enjoyed it, although he left behind the butternut squash and cranberries that were included.\\n\\nHe also got the Margherita flatbread which was really nice. If you were expecting the heartiness of an average pizza, you will find this a bit small but right on target for flavor. The thin crust had a good crunch with just the right amounts of sauce and cheese for its size, and the toppings were quite good. (At least I thought so. He picked off the cherry tomato halves and gave them to me because he likes very plain pizza. Lol)\\n\\nThe only item I was underwhelmed by was the house made corn tortilla chips with guac and salsa. The chips were a bit too hard and I thought the dips both needed some salt.\\n\\nLastly, and in my opinion, most importantly: The chia water.\\nI got the Ginger Mint Chia water. If there is anything I will absolutely insist you try from here, this is it. Everything else was really good but this stuff got me immediately hooked on chia water. The seeds seem to make water more satisfying. As I am sitting here I am sipping home-made chia-lemon-strawberry-ginger water (I didn't have lime or mint leaves). I can't stop drinking the stuff. Caution, trying this drink may result in finding yourself at the store checkout with a 2 lb bag of chia seeds under your arm...(not that it's a bad thing, really, they're super healthy!) Also I had no idea fruit infused water could have such a strong natural sweetness. Before this I always assumed infusing water with fruit would have a blander result, but now I know better! I will be using this trick all summer for refreshing sweet drinks without all the sugar of fruit juice. Also started using frozen strawberries for ice cubes.\\n\\nI am so grateful this place delivers.

They even serve up biscuits and gravy out of this place. The biscuits and gravy were good but not for me. I can't tell what sets the gravy apart from country gravy but there's something so not for me.\\nI did enjoy a slice of salted pecan pie.

My husband and our two littles and were in town visiting local family.  We got an earlier reservation hoping that our tired weary little ones would zone out and color.  I was pleased to see a kids menu though definitely was not expecting it.  Firstly, the place has such a laid back but upscale vibe.  It's foodie vegan food but without the pretentiousness.  The service was exemplary.  The waitress couldn't have been nicer or more interested in serving us.  As a vegan who avoids most gluten she easily walked me through several options and made outstanding recommendations.  My kids split a flatbread kids pizza ( that sans the cheese ) I would have ordered in a restaurant.  The crust was properly done and slightly crunchy.  My kids scarfed it down.  They brought us several baskets of bread as our party had a few beers first.  I chose the samosa cakes, kale salad, and Jamaican jerk tempeh.  The samosa cakes were delicate and I could each vegetable and herb as it was lightly fried and served in a heavenly sauce.  The kale salad was good enough as kale salads go.  The jerk tempeh was outstanding.  It sat on black rice with greens and this funky plantain sauce.  My husband ordered the quinoa polenta cakes which based on the one bite he gave me tasted like a unique twist on cornbread.  My cousin had the jackfruit enchiladas which he said were quite good.  I've been to a lot of the top 10 vegan/veg places in the US and has been wanting to try Leaf.  I think it rivals Millennium in Berkeley based on its ties to local produce, price/value, casual but upscale atmosphere and service.  I will definitely be coming back.

Fish was great, octopus was beyond tender.  I had the duck fat poached swordfish served with butternut squash and pork belly.  The swordfish was surprisingly dry but still very good and it actually worked with the super fatty pork belly to balance it out.  The brussels sprouts are amazing.  Not to be missed.  We also had the collard greens which were quite tasty but I honestly could have eaten another side of brussels instead.  We also had a \\"s'mores\\" ice cream sandwich for dessert.  It came with two whole ice cream sandwiches which is great for sharing but that wasn't explicit on the menu.  They were quite good.\\n\\nOverall I would definitely eat there again and recommend it to anyone for a nice romantic or power business dinner.  I would have given 4.5 stars because there were a few spots of waiting on our waiter and also their valet system is ridiculous.  It was in the low 40s and the heater wasn't turned on while waiting 5+ minutes for them to fetch the car from god knows where.

The rub they use is good, but it's too much - it overwhelms the beef rather than augment it  The king crab leg that comes with it is kind of unnecessary, in my opinion, and the potatoes it was served with were a waste of space.

By the time it was noon, there were plenty of people in the restaurant with some waiting for tables. \\n\\nI enjoyed their white sangria, which was very crisp and refreshing! It's different than the other white sangrias I've had because it wasn't overwhelmingly liquored up and sour. The fruits that were in it made the drink even more refreshing. \\n\\nWe ordered plenty of the small tapas dishes and then a couple of the larger dishes; all of these we were able to share amongst the three of us. \\n\\nYuca Rellena- it looks like a twinkie but it tastes SO MUCH BETTER! The croquetas with the cheese were a good mix and made the dish moist. What makes it even better is the sauce that is plated beneath it (huanca√≠na sauce). \\n\\nMixto Chorrillano- great tasting ceviche with shrimp, octopus, scallops, mussels, and fish were fresh and delicious! It comes with a large piece of sweet potato that was soft and went well with the juices of the seafood, and a piece of corn too. Overall, it was a great dish and I loved it!\\n\\nAnticucho de corazon- I'd never had beef hearts before and I was a little afraid of it, but this was pretty good; tasted just like steak. It wasn't tough or rubbery (as I feared) and it went really well with this salsa mix that looked like it was a sweet potato base (but I'm not sure). \\n\\nLomo saltado- DELICIOUS beef tenders! OMG, the meat was tender and juicy. The flavors were great and went well with the rice (although we had forgotten it was garlic rice because it didn't have the garlicky taste). The meat tenders were cut well and the dish portion itself was HUGE. My friend really enjoyed the fries on the side too!\\n\\nArroz con mariscos- YUMMY!!!! The seafood pieces were not scarce at all! Every bite had pieces of fish or mussels and the taste was just phenomenal! I highly recommend this dish. It's large portion too and we shared it among the three of us. \\n\\nOverall, this was a great experience. The atmosphere was wonderful and the service was great! They brought out a basket of fresh bread when we were low and were attentive to our needs. It's located in a great area too with plenty of street parking and other eateries and shops nearby.

My earlier childhood was spent in a little town outside of Atlanta where they had an Old Fashioned drug store with counter service (Like our Nau's) and I spent glorious days there just sitting at that counter.   Waffle Houses remind me of that drug store.  I learned most of what I know today about life and people, sitting at that lunch counter listening to old people shoot the shit all day long. \\n\\nWe had a waffle house too. There were days I ate breakfast AND lunch there with my grandparents.  \\n\\nEven though I only live four miles from this waffle house, I only remember it is there when I head east to Houston.  I get back to Austin, usually coming back on 71, and completely forget again the Waffle House is even there. \\n\\nSunday morning around 9AM, the IHOP looked too crowded, and suddenly the Waffle House popped into my brain. I'm so glad it did. \\n\\nThe parking lot was only about half full but it contained:\\n1. Three 18 wheelers. \\n2. An old beat up ford truck with three hunting dogs in a pen. \\n3. A 2007 Lime Green ford explorer with spinners and black tinted windows. \\n4. A 1971 Chevy Bel-Air with shag carpeting.\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bel_Air\\n5. A land rover\\n6. A new Porche Boxter\\n7. And now my wife's new Honda Fit. \\n\\nI don't usually focus on race, because I think it is the 21st century and that it shouldn't matter anymore because we are all mutts. But I couldn't help notice the staff included an African American head cook, a white hippie looking guy fry cook, an African American waitress, a Hispanic waitress, an older white waitress, and a young white waitress.  When I noticed that, I looked at the clientele. We ran the gamut, Asian, white, black, Hispanic. It was like a Benetton ad. \\n\\nWith all respect to Sasha C's review, and that priceless, priceless song. You always order the same thing at a waffle house:\\n\\nCoffee, water, and the two egg breakfast. It is two eggs cooked how ya want em, side of bacon or sausage, hash-browns or grits, and the buttered toast of the gods.  My wife and I both ordered this, the total was $14.32, plus tip.  I get my hash-browns scattered and capped. (Onions and mushrooms)\\n\\nFor two dollars and 55 cents more, you can add a waffle.  When we do, we usually split the waffle. \\n\\nAlso if you like Jelly on your toast be sure to tell them what flavor, otherwise you could end up with that mixed fruit crap. Its like Prison jelly. \\n\\nIf possible, we always sit at the counter, because I love sitting at counters(and bars!), and that way I can watch the cooks.  You can keep your Emirils, and Bobby Flays, for my money the best chefs in the world are experienced short order cooks at places like a Waffle House. \\n\\nFor those of you that have never seen it, here is how it works.  You give your order to the waitress, she calls it out verbally to the cooks. The hash-brown fry cook, plates the meal using some secret code with the positioning of condiments. The head cook has already started the eggs and meat for the plate.  The two cooks work their magic, if there is a waffle involved the waffle cook adds the waffle to the plate. The other two cooks meet in the middle one adds the eggs and the meat, the other the hash browns and BAM! There is your food. \\n\\nIt is like watching this wonderful greasy dance of greasy cook angels.  I like to find my plate and follow it through the whole process.  \\"Oooh here come my eggs, and there is the bacon.\\"  You can also bet amongst yourselves on who's plate will come out complete first.  \\n\\nIt is possible to have a bad experience at a Waffle House. I remember this one in Bridge City tried to kill me on the way to New Orleans. \\n\\nThe trick is to find a clean one with a great head cook.  Just based on this one visit, I've found one.  I can pretty much guarantee we will be there once a week from now till we go to Sacha's great Waffle House in the sky. I'll be sure to post updates. \\n\\nWe never had to use the juke box, motown was already playing."},{"name":"D'Amelio‚Äôs Restaurant","address":"306 Revere St","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Amazing pastas.

It's not that I don't appreciate a salad, but our assumption is usually that if food is served together on the same plate, the chef chose to put those dishes together for a reason.

As in flavorless.  After a few bites he wasn't even interested in finishing it.

I waited for 10 minutes for this thing, and it had mayonnaise on it. The only thing I asked them NOT to put on it. I hate mayonnaise.\\n\\nI hate mayonnaise in a passionate way in which it is impossible for me to ignore the mayonnaise residue on my sandwich after I wipe it off. As infrequently as I order there, McDonald's always gets my no mayo order correct.\\n\\nMy receipt clearly stated \\"NO mayo\\"--that was it. Everything BUT mayo. Gah.\\n\\nSo, yes, Five Guys was okay, but I don't really get what the fuss is about. If they had gotten my order correct, they might have earned one additional star, but I really can't see myself going back. It would be one thing if it was a great value, but it's not that much cheaper than the Vortex (considering there is no beer involved)."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"AWE~SOME  (she says in a sing-songy voice).  \\n\\nHubs and I had reservations for a Wednesday night at 5:30.  Weird, I know, but that's life with three kids.  You take a night out when you can get it.  Also, it was our 8th anniversary.  \\n\\nFood was amazing.  As has been mentioned, the menu is prix fixe, which didn't bother me at all.  I found the portions to be the perfect size.  I don't want a huge plate of food if I'm going to eat 3 courses.  I had a delightful glass of white wine from Hungary.  Didn't even know Hungary made wine!  Our server was courteous, knowledgeable, and attentive, but not annoying.  She didn't hover.  By the time we left just after 7, the place was packed!  I was surprised that it was so busy on a weeknight.  Of course, maybe it seemed busy because it's so tiny.  Reservations are a MUST!\\n\\nI only have two complaints and they are so very minor.  1.  The chairs were SOOOO uncomfortable.  We sat at a 2-top table, and our chairs were tall bar-stools, but they had no back.  You couldn't lean back and relax.  Both our backs were tired and achy after we left.  I could not sit through a meal here while pregnant.  So guys, keep that in mind if you're planning a romantic night our for your pregnant wife/girlfriend/whatever.  2.  Tiny parking lot~Since our reservation was at 5:30, we got a spot in their lot, but there were only 8 or so spaces, so a later reservation would have meant parking in the neighborhood and walking.  \\n\\nPLEASE go to Lenoir!  So delicious.  They even managed to prepare beets in a way that I liked (and I hate beets).  We need more places like this in Austin!"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Stumbled in during SXSW between shows around 5-6pm...

The location is a small converted house, with large formerly outdoor patio that's enclosed, a small bar with just a few barstools inside, and a dining room or two. The food was excellent (duck was tender and delicious. We had then had the the grouper, which was good too. Apparently, the mussels are to die for, though we didn't order them.) The wine list is good, and the service was unmatched. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, gave great wine recommendations. Will definitely, definitely return when next in Atlanta. Great restaurant!"},{"name":"Townsman","address":"120 Kingston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was very excited for the opening of this spot near my place of employment by the stellar team I admired down in Providence at Farmstead. When the opening was delayed a few weeks, my first visit almost didn't happen before I gave birth, which would have delayed my visit by a few months. Luckily for me, I was able to sneak in for dinner at 40ish weeks pregnant and enjoy the delicious brown bread and wonderful food. After my first visit I have enjoyed many a business lunch and the occasional happy hour here. \\n\\nThe Scene:\\nYou enter from Kingston St (thus the address) and have a cute waiting area and a long bar zone with comfy chair clusters if you are just looking for happy hour. On weekdays you may need to arrive early as it gets packed! You can order a limited menu in the bar area, but the small tables make it a bit difficult to balance any food. The cocktails and wine list are well chosen, though the narrow area is a bit awkward to navigate through. \\nThe restaurant area is steel design, more open and airy than the bar area. There is also a kitchen view row of seating, which I've never tried, but could be fun for a date. It gets a bit boisterous during both lunch and happy hour. \\n\\nThe Service:\\nAlways lovely and professional, my only complaint is sometimes the lunches drag too long with check-ins for coffee and dessert without having a check ready. Nit picky, but important to be a but speedier for lunch. \\n\\nThe Food:\\nTownsman's version of a Cuban and the country fried chicken are by far my favorite sandwiches. The potato chips are DELICIOUS as are the pickles. The sides are made and presented with as much care as all elements of the main dishes, allowing a symphony of tastiness on your plate. Also, red zen iced tea. Just do it. It's spicy and refreshing. The shellfish has always been good, though everything else is so delicious and creative here, I wouldn't come especially to order it. If it's to your taste, try to include a fish element in your order! Do I seem a bit disjointed in my recommendations it's because everything is SO GOOD. Even though I am a frequent guest, it takes me forever to make up my mind every time I come here!\\n\\nI highly recommend this gem for whatever type of mood you are in, as long as the mood includes hearty New England fare."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my first time here and it was for my husband's birthday. The experience was horrible. I ordered the fried chicken and it came out raw. There was blood dripping from inside the chicken which got into my mac n cheese. I immediately lost my appetite. Everyone at my table lost their appetite but tried their best to eat their dishes. I've heard so much good things about this place but it did not meet my expectations. The food was not worth the price and it's supposed to be Asian fusion but it tasted Americanize to the fullest. The waitress here is nice but forgetful.
