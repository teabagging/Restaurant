Lots of Italian lingo and wine bottles scattered across the store. There is tons of seating with most being tables. There are a few booths thou. The entire kitchen is super open. Only separating the dining room and kitchen is a waist high counter top. Very impressive and a bold move. But it is a good looking store and was clean. \\n\\nMenu - well it's an Italian place so it is all pizza, pastas and protein plates. I liked how the names were not normal. It was listed as spaghetti, fettuccine and so on. They had actu names which was nice. Not a very big menu but they did have lots of good looking food. The wine list is pretty varied and pretty extensive. Overall it is a pretty normal menu with all the key favorites and then some unique items as well\\n\\nService - the service was good overall. It was slightly confusing thou. At first we had a gentleman helping us but halfway thru we were being helped by a young lady. I dont mind if someone is helping the other but we didnt know where the tip was going. Who do I tip? Do I tip double? Lol, what is going on. They were both attentive and both very friendly. So I guess we got lucky and had 2 good servers? Lol. The service was good if just slightly strange and unusual \\n\\nFood - i got the rigatoni (something I cant pronounce) and the wife got the .... well it was fettuccine alfredo with shrimp.  My dish was a hearty pasta dish with a nice red sauce, good meats and large rigatoni. My dish was really good. Both dishes were also very generous portions. The noodles in mine were cooked well, not mushy or hard. The sauce was a pretty average red meat sauce but still had some good flavor. The meat thou was so good.  It was cooked well, nice and juicy and not dried out. The meats themselves also just had a great natural dead animal goodness. My dish was very enjoyable. Nice flavor, great meats and all around delicious. The wifes fettuccine was good just not made correctly in guess. And if that is the actual way then, that is disappointing. What made it seem incorrect is that is was super watery and the sauce very thin. It basically didnt stick to the pasta and just wound up pooling underneath the noodles. The sauce tasted fine but since it was so watery all we could taste was just noodles and a slight hint of sauce. The shrimp thou was cooked perfectly. Not overcooked and cooked just right to remove that overpowering ocean taste. The fettuccine was still pretty good but just kinda watery. We also both got a \\"side salad\\" that was very impressive. These salads huge.  Biggest side salads I have ever seen.\\n\\nOverall - despite some eccentricities, this was a really good visit. The service was good, the food was good and we had a good time. It was strange not knowing who our actual waiter was, or where the tip was going. And despite one of the dishes being kind of watery. They were both still really good dishes. We both had leftovers, which is always a bonus. Once we let the fettuccine hold in the fridge till later that night, the sauce congealed together to make it a better dish on the second round. But overall it was a solid meal."},{"name":"Taqueria La Fuente","address":"12198 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"I'm definitely a happy camper, I'm new in town was looking for some carne Asada fries, called them for an order, they stated it wasn't on their menu but was happy to make some for me and they were super friendly when I went to pick it up"},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place.

I ordered a fig and goat cheese sandwich, a side of fries with truffle oil and rosemary, and an unsweet tea. \\n\\nThe counter server who took my order wasn't particularly friendly--it was a very businesslike transaction with no smile or \\"how are you today?\\" (It wasn't super busy when I went and no one was behind me in line, so those small moments could have happened in my opinion.) Also, when ordering tea, it's usually helpful if someone points you in the direction of it--in this case, the tea's not easily visible behind a giant Freestyle Coke machine, so a quick \\"tea is around the corner\\" would have been nice, but oh well.\\n\\nMy food came quickly and everything was piping hot (I had to let stuff cool a bit first lest I burn my mouth on hot cheese). The goat cheese had melted nicely and there were some discernible moments of fig and slight sweetness from the honey as well. Basil was also supposed to be included but I only found one small wilted leaf at the end of one of my sandwich halves. I would have liked a more balanced mixture of fig and basil; I felt like the sandwich was a bit overwhelmingly cheese and not much else. (It was good cheese, and I know it's a grilled *cheese* place, but a little more of the other stuff on the sandwich is nice too...) The edges of the bread were a bit hard and I found the interior portions, which were nice and soft, more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe truffled rosemary fries? Meh. The first few were pretty good: crispy, I could taste the truffle oil, and definite pieces of fresh rosemary. But as I got further down in the pile, there was less of the truffle oil and it started tasting like just your average ordinary pile o' fries. I didn't finish the fries as there was enough there for a couple of people. A good bargain at $2.50 for a large amount of fries, but I wouldn't likely order again as I didn't find them anything special.\\n\\nI found it interesting that an older male went around to every table to ask how everything was, even talking with other tables of single diners eating by themselves--but I didn't get asked how my food was for whatever reason. Weird. \\n\\nOverall, I found Toasted's food to be fine.

I chose the tiramisu gelato which was so good and rich. You could taste the tiramisu flavor to it both the cream, coffee, and chocolate. I was actually impressed since most tiramisu ice cream I've tried is just too sweet or doesn't really even resemble tiramisu. The cannoli was the highlight. I loved the shell, it was crispy and it had a nice taste to it - not too sweet. The ricotta filling was incredible! It was sweet but not at all overbearing and it made the entire cannoli a must have.\\n\\nThe place - very unassuming spot. It is a bit dark on the inside but really great sitting if you can be by the open door/windows area. It is a great spot to chat as well as to people watch.

Oh hell yeah.   I have to admit, I know it's blasphemy but...  Dan's breakfast taco is my favorite breakfast taco in town.  The reason for this is HASH BROWNS.  As opposed to home-fries or cubed taters, these taters in these tacos are shredded and there are plenty of them.  The potato-to-egg ratio is way heavy on the tater and this I like.  To further the blasphemy, I usually use ketchup instead of hot-sauce.  What can I say, I like it mild in the morning.\\n\\n----\\n\\nBut breakfast is secondary - THIS IS THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN!  I swear by it.  Something so perfect about the way the buttery toasted bun melts in with the cheese and the chopped onions and the wilted shredded lettuce.  Succulent!  The flavor of this burger just kills me, literally.  I wouldn't even eat hamburgers anymore if Dan's weren't out there, tempting me with its deliciousness.\\n\\nThe folks who work there are always super nice (barring the frazzled swamped breakfast crew - not that they're not nice, just stressed out).  I've heard that Dan's treats their employees very well, and even vaguely recall hearing something about a tuition imbursement thing they do..  not 100% sure about that...  But I will say the crew seems happy and like they're having fun -- never miserable like so many employees so many other places all over the world....\\n\\nThe patrons at Dan's are varied and diverse, but one thing they all have in common is that they just seem very REAL.  Whatever that means..  (has nothing to do with \\"Real America\\")..  Dan's customers at any given time are some kind of beautiful rainbow  cross-section of the demographic.

I mean, it's not exactly pizza they serve here and with this new location, Cambridge 1 isn't exactly in Cambridge anymore. Nope, it's now in Fenway - confusing.\\n\\nSo instead of typical pizza, what you get here are tasty freshly-cooked flatbreads with enough toppings on them to just about warrant being called pizza. I suppose you could classify them as Californian-style... gourmet pizza topped with non-traditional ingredients, especially fresh produce (arugula is used a ton here). You can blame Wolfgang Puck for popularizing this style in the 80s and 90s.\\n\\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of Californian pizza - you get much smaller portions and you have to deal with some freaky shit like potato on your pizza - but these pizza-things were actually pretty tasty, and at $7 a go, I could be back here for lunch more often.\\n\\nWhere Cambridge 1 really excels though is style. Coming from the group that gave us Middlesex and Audubon, you get what's expected -  sleek interior and a great modern finish. They serve wine and beer and even have an outdoor area. Too many places in Boston fore-go their appearance and concentrate on the food.

The less busy counters there were no issues and every staff member I encountered was extremely courteous and friendly.\\n\\nWill definitely be going back to milk street cafe!"},{"name":"The Imperial","address":"726 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"It's sad since I've driven by The Imperial several times without noticing it, and it took ATL Burger Week to get me to check it out. \\n\\nMy friend and I went one weeknight, and the place was full of patrons. Not sure if this is typical or it was due to Burger Week. Since it was a mild evening, we lucked out and snagged a table on the patio after being told by a staffer we could sit anywhere. Like Brick Store, we didn't seem to have one dedicated server but a rotation of various people who were attending to us, some a little more outgoing than others.\\n\\nThe Damn Gouda burger wasn't bad on its own but paled a little in comparison to subsequent Burger Week burgers I consumed. But for $5, you can't complain. It certainly was a messy tower of beef, fried onions and pickles, plenty of bacon, and gouda cheese. The toasted bun was a nice touch. Because of all the burger in the bacon, it was a good thing we didn't add said item to the La Poutine de Georgia ($7.25) then. The poutine was my favorite aspect of the meal. I love pimento cheese so adding it to gravy-laden fries is brilliant. My friend and I happily noshed on the poutine while waiting for the burgers to arrive.\\n\\nParking: There is a free parking lot behind the restaurant, with spaces on the eastern side.

This place is located on the Boardwalk at Walt Disney World. The decor inside this large restaurant is tastefully done but also kind of boring. Besides the open kitchen there is nothing really special about Kouzzina's decor. \\n\\nKouzzina's dinner menu is mostly Greek inspired cuisine but their breakfast menu is more Americanized with bits of Greek ingredients. \\nTo start off we ordered their Kouzzina Breakfast Pastry Basket, which consisted of a mini blueberry muffin, a mini croissant, a honey roll and two slices of cinnamon crumb cake. The crumb cake was really good but the other three pastries were just OK, nothing to write home about. \\nThis is what my wife and I each ordered for our main entree's: \\n\\nMe- Stacked Kouzzina Breakfast- Two poached eggs, Kalamata olive toast, artichoke spread, sweet potato hash and bacon and also one blueberry orange granola pancake \\nWife- Classic Golden Waffle - Topped with whipped Mascarpone cheese, honey, and chopped pecans with a side of chicken sausage \\n\\nOut of everything we ordered, my wife's Waffle was by far the best dish. The waffle was light and fluffy and all the toppings (especially the Mascarpone cheese) gave this waffle a uniquely delicious taste. Her chicken sausage was good too. My pancake was just OK. The pancake itself was just a regular pancake, all the other ingredients were just placed on top instead of being baked into the batter like I was hoping they would have been. My stacked breakfast was really good. I liked that all the components are placed next to each other so you can make a sandwich out of everything if you choose to do so. My only complaint about this dish was the bacon was not crispy and was almost flavorless. \\n\\nNow I will tell you what got my wife and I so ticked off. We arrived at Kouzzina at about 8:30am. The restaurant at most was only 15% full. In fact, when they sat us in the back dining room we were the only guests in that particular room. Well, right when our main entree's were being brought out the hostess sat a family of 4 (Mom, Dad and 2 very young boys) at the table directly next to us. And when I say right next to us, I mean less than an arm lengths away. The mom and one of the young boys honestly had to squeeze by me to get to their seats. The first thing I noticed was the boy (age 3 at most) who squeezed past me was already whining that he wanted to go home, a bad sign right off the back. About 5 minutes after their arrival, that little boy was screaming, crying and throwing his silverware off the table. They placed this crying boy back in his stroller but after about 2 minutes they removed him because he was only get louder and rowdier. After taking him out the mother tried to squeeze both her and her son through the small space between our tables at the same time. Guess what happened? The crying boy started flailing and knocked over my drink. The mom never apologized or even offered to help us clean up the mess. All she said was \\"I see you guys don't have kids\\". Once we finally got a few extra napkins from our server to clean up the kids mess, the boy started another tantrum and kicked the corner of our table, knocking my fork and the pepper shaker to the floor. \\n\\nWhat aggravates me the most about this whole episode is not the bratty child or the god awful parents. What really angers me is the fact that the staff at Kouzzina sat them right next to us when there was at least 13-15 open tables around us. I still don't understand it. Were the employees expecting a huge rush where they felt they needed to pack us in close together to maximize space? Were they just doing it to be jerks? I don't know. All I know is I wanted to love this place because I have had such great experiences at other Iron Chefs restaurants (Bobby Flay & Mario Batali). Up until that point the service was great. Our server was a super friendly guy who told us all about their menu, Cat Cora and a bunch of other fun facts about Disney World. Neither our server nor any other members of the staff (a few of them witnessed what went on) ever apologized about what happened with that family and their bratty boy. And if you're wondering why we didn't asked to be moved, that is because we were almost done with our food once all this drama went down. And to top it off, our server knew we were there on our honeymoon. UGH! \\n\\nIn all honesty I was planning on returning to Kouzzina so I could try some of the intriguing sounding dishes on their dinner menu, like the cinnamon stewed chicken or the saffron pasta. After this incident though, I think I'll just go to one of the other many delicious restaurants that can be found throughout WDW.

The pimento cheese was okay, but nothing to write home about and the crackers and (soupy) pepper jelly that came with it weren't great either. The house made pickles were very good, but I felt like it was a waste of money and too small for sharing. We sat at the bar and though the bartender/server was nice, and to his credit, did keep our water glasses full at all times, he never really checked in with us even though the place was pretty dead. No asking if we wanted desert or suggesting anything at all, which I guess is fine, maybe he's just not into upselling.

For many years there was a single one (Samba), run by the same group that runs a series of Thai restaurants (go figure).  It is pretty awful, and eventually closed, so I was pretty excited when I saw a new churrascaria opening up here. \\n\\nI'm guessing this new location with a new name is a reincarnation of the old Samba.  I could swear some of the staff looked similar.  But I may just be imagining things.  Rodizio selections seems pretty similar too.  Hm......\\n\\nI popped in for lunch, and ordered the $15.95 lunch, which included salad bar, hot table as well as the table-side carved meats.  \\n\\nThe salad bar has a reasonably large selection of fresh product.  Some of the composed salads looked overly mayoed, but overall it was a decent selection.  I enjoyed my salad choices.  \\n\\nThe hot table was fairly subpar with a warmed over pasta dish, an overcooked fish, and some greasy sides.  I skipped most of the hot table as it is more of a distraction than a bonus.  \\n\\nOn to the main event - during lunch they serve a limited selection of rodizio meats tableside including:\\n\\n- Leg of Lamb - This was my favourite overall.  The lamb was tender, not overly gamey yet still full flavoured.  \\n\\n- Picanha (top sirloin cap) - This cut of beef was tender, served nice and rare, and was lightly salted with a coarse salt.  Nice cut.  \\n\\n- Contra filet (striploin) - This cut of beef was overcooked, served well done, and not enjoyable.\\n\\n- Pork - This was severely overcooked and VERY dry.  Skipable.  \\n\\n- Chicken - These were the worst meat by far.  It was all drumsticks, which in theory since it is dark meat should have been moist.  But they were entirely overcooked to the point of being so dry that they were almost inedible.  Believe it or not they made the pork look moist.  Definite skip.\\n\\n- Calabresa - These sausages had a nice level of seasoning, bordering on almost too much.  But they were full flavoured, yet still very juicy inside.  Overall a decent choice.\\n\\nSo the long and short of it is that I think Samba has reincarnated but slightly improved from my past experiences there.  The meats had some real failures, and a few that were decent.  \\n\\nBut overall I'm left with the same conclusion as with Samba - I doubt I'll be back anytime soon."},{"name":"Haiku Poetic Food & Art","address":"800 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Used to be great.

The signs all emphasize this. While they have a menu, they tend to discourage using it, ESPECIALLY during lunch hours, when they are focused on the buffet which constitutes most of their business. The amount of negative reviews by those with unrealistic expectations of a BUFFET is staggering. \\n\\nTo the person who said \\"Indian places usually ask if you want white or brown rice\\" -- no, they don't. This is not a Japanese restaurant. Japan and India are in fact different countries with wildly different cuisines.\\n\\nWith that in mind, the quality of buffet here is adequate. People seem to think that a $10 all-you-can-eat deal should include the highest quality Indian food available -- it doesn't. This is a buffet. By the very nature of buffet eating, you're not getting the most delicately-prepared food. You're getting something that can be made and served in bulk. If you are expecting the finest Rogan Josh or Chicken 65 in Atlanta, you will not find it here. Because this is an AYCE buffet.\\n\\nThat said, I have always enjoyed the options here -- the dal is always consistent, there are usually 2-3 great vegetable sides: spiced greens, broccoli, a potato dish...occasionally more exotic stuff like arum and bok choy. The curry fish is always tender and good. Several meat options, the requisite naan, rice, salad, chutney and rice pudding/carrot dessert.\\n\\nI'm guessing I've been here between 50-75 times in the last several years, and this place serves totally acceptable bulk Indian food for around $10 a head.

San Francisco has lots of extremely expensive eateries, in no small part because commercial real estate rents are insanely high. Not sure what the justification is for prices in Racion that can be calculated in multiples of three or four in comparison to prices at a pricey tapas bar in SF. But perhaps rent and cost of doing business in Portland is truly four times as high as SF. Then again, perhaps not.\\n\\nSuppose I went to a tapas restaurant that was only twice as expensive as Zarzuela. For such prices, I would expect perfection (spoiler alert: Our meal at Racion was very good, but it was not flawless). When prices are three to four times the cost of Zarzuela (with portions that require a scanning electron microscope), even culinary perfection would not transcend the bad taste left in one's mouth from the sense that one's wallet is being taken for a fairly pretentious ride.\\n\\nI gave Racion three stars, despite the prices, because the food was very good, and the service was excellent. We also really enjoyed the cocktails we chose (Dutch Master Duo, if memory serves). A couple of the dishes were, in fact, delicious (the poached egg dish was excellent, and the thimbleful of soup was a superb combination of flavors in nice presentation.\\n\\nBut the rest of the dishes were either almost overpowered by salt, or were insipid and under-seasoned. The dessert, a supposedly pine-infused custard, was very pretty to see, but neither of us detected any pine flavors, and instead the dish had a noticeable overtone of an earthy flavor, akin to Stilton or perhaps a goat cheese.\\n\\nClearly, the owners and executive chefs of Racion have an ambitious and imaginative agenda. I wish them success because of their verve and originality.

To say we ordered too much would be an understatement.  Bruschetta was good, clam chowder good, but not notable.  The steak was cooked to order and everyone at the table received their steak as they had requested it cooked - mine, medium rare.  The cut of steak wasn't the same grade as Ruth's or Fleming's, but it's not really fair to compare.  It was good and I ate it all!\\n\\nFor dessert I went halves in on a baked alaska (I had never had it before) and it was yummy, but on a full stomach I couldn't manage too much.\\n\\nSteak Night Three?  While it's not in the same realm as Ruth's or Fleming's, it doesn't need to be.  Frank's is a great deal for the money with an enjoyable waitstaff, a comfortable dining room, complete with Keno and an entertaining drink menu.  I mean, whaddya want?

Of the local coffee shops, so far they have the best coffee that I've tried.  Making me walk through their shop with all their bags of coffee and different flavored syrups for sale before I get to the coffee shop itself is ingenious.  I'm drooling before I even order a coffee or see a pastry because I was gawking at the stuff and inhaling the scent of fresh coffee beans.  \\n\\nDuring my first years in Columbus, Stauf's was this legendary place that I'd hear a good friend of mine weave stories of bygone days of frequenting the place.  Then one day I was brought to this place and experienced the wonder for myself.  But since I didn't know my way around Columbus and wasn't driving, it still seemed somewhat mysterious because I had no idea how to get to it!  After I'd been in Columbus a while and then moved to Grandview, Stauf's was no longer a story but within a short bike ride.\\n\\nThough Stauf's Coffee Roasters is in conjunction with Cup o' Joe, it doesn't seem to me like they are the same.  I like Stauf's coffee and pastries better than Cup o' Joe.  Stauf's hot coffee is great, but a wonderful summertime drink that I've found on their menu is a brewed iced coffee, toddy style.  The muffins aren't bad, either.  I've had a chocolate chip banana and a blueberry muffin, of course.  The chocolate chip banana was pretty good.  Surprisingly, I liked the combination of banana nut muffin minus the nuts and plus chocolate, as I'm not a big fan of chocolate chip muffins.  The blueberry muffin was about average.  It was pretty sweet, but not to the point of sickening.  A dessert item that will keep you up for those all nighters is the espresso brownie.  I suggest having it by itself or with something not sweet at all because it's pretty rich.\\n\\nAbout the only downfall with Stauf's is their Wi-Fi.  My computer said the connection was excellent but it was running slower than molasses and would often up and quit all together.  And all I was doing was checking my e-mail.  I thought maybe it was my computer, so I went down the street to Panera to test it out and there the connection was running just fine.  If you're looking for a good Wi-Fi caf√©, I'm sorry to say Stauf's is not your best bet.

If you're not good with heat, try the Chengdu hot dry chicken... similar taste but not quite as many chili's..."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good food and great atmosphere.

Well, the owner thinks otherwise. I dropped in today for a simple lunch and was treated like dried tortillas used for chicken feed. The owner insisted I had to order from a menu that was not in use anymore, the logic being that when the groupon was bought, that's what I had to order from. I insisted that essentially my groupon was like having the $10 bucks I paid for. He was having nothing of it. What I was served was 2 scrambled eggs with diced up Chorizo, and a spatulas worth of beans, with a half ounce of some sauce from a bottle. Oh ya, and a coffee I did not order. No tortillas to scoop it up with? Right, like I said, I was the dried tortilla fool who walked into this place.

From the introduction until the ending interaction with the waiting staff. When my colleague and I were seated for breakfast the waiter immediately started in with, \\"What do you want?\\" I looked at my colleague and I believe we shared a moment of wanting to get the heck out of here based on the to the point question that begged us to ask if we were an inconvenience to the waitress. However, it was a working lunch and we did not have much time so we decided to still eat there. She got our drinks ordered and following that our food order. I just want to say the rapport building stage where you introduce yourself to a diner in a restaurant or a customer in any business was completely absent. If someone asked me, who helped you, I would only be able to give a physical description as she wore no name badge and did not even bother to introduce herself. Also I put in a to go order for a guy back at the office and that took forever even though we ordered it from the start. Also to top it all off, I asked for an itemized receipt as this was a business lunch and I have to provide my company with a itemized receipt to get reimbursed. Guess what? She failed to provide one. So I had to wait another ten minutes to ask her for one only to have her tell me it would take another ten minutes to generate one. It seems like a simple request especially when I asked for one at the beginning. The food was your classic diner table fare. Nothing special and nothing worthy of making this poor service interaction more than a one star rating. I would say from a service perspective, you need to get back to the basics and hold your people to a higher standard or you will continue to loss customers like myself based on this interaction."},{"name":"JazzTastings","address":"164 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"Great experience for a group of 6. \\nMy wife and some friends visited Jazz Tastings on a Friday night  08-21/2015.

The food, drinks, service and the band were all great. The band had many years of experience between them with a resume that runs through the elite in the entertainment industry.

I had no beverage -- just water. Cost for JUST this one plate of food, with nothing else, was $27.50 BEFORE tax & tip! [Big Cheeks platter is normally $26 with 1 hot + 1 cold side, but they upcharge you $1.50 to get 2 hot sides instead of 1 hot + 1 cold -- pretty classy .... NOT!]\\n\\nMy 3 meats were ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. They gave me 4 TINY ribs, which were definitely tasty, with a nice, smoky flavor. They were cooked well, too -- neither overdone nor underdone.  The brisket was dry and unremarkable, and the top of it was super salty to the point of being inedible. [Note: the top layer is about 1\\" of pure fat, which is normal. I don't eat that -- I think it's gross -- but I have friends who do.] The pulled pork was the best meat of the bunch. Add some North Carolina (vinegar-based) sauce to the pulled pork, put it between the 2 white bread slices they give you, add the pickle & onion garnish that's on your plate, and you end up with a tasty sandwich!\\n\\nMy 2 hot sides were mac & cheese and baked beans. Portions were generous (they're served in small coffee cups). The mac & cheese was REALLY good! It was almost as good as Soul Fire's mac & cheese. The baked beans, however, were unquestionably the WORST baked beans I've ever had at any bbq place. They were devoid of flavor and so wrong in so many other ways, too -- hard to believe they'd serve these beasties to the public. Avoid them!\\n\\nService was fine -- pretty much as expected -- though I was there when they weren't crowded and there were plenty of open tables.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the pulled pork and the mac & cheese were my \\"high points\\" (if you can call them that, at these prices).\\n\\nAs far as local (Boston/Cambridge/Somerville) BBQ places go, I prefer either Blue Ribbon (even though they've gotten worse in the last few years) and Soul Fire (consistently pretty good, for New England!) to Sweet Cheeks. Redbones used to be at the bottom of my list, but I think I'd even go to Redbones over Sweet Cheeks at this point.\\n\\nI know Sweet Cheeks is pretty new. Hopefully, in time, their prices will go down and their quality will improve. I'd try it again if that happens. I just can't believe I paid $34 ($27.50 plus tax and tip) for just the one plate of so-so food described above (with no cornbread, no beverage, and no dessert, but did include a $1.50 upcharge to substitute a hot side for a cold side)!"},{"name":"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot","address":"2400 Seton Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"A few months ago, a friend and I decided to try this place out because of a groupon we found, a 2 for $20 deal.

I'll have to give it another try to give a better review on the flavor profile.\\n\\nOur dinner combo included two types of meat (we chose beef and chicken) plus vegetables.  We also added potato noodles (super slippery but delightfully chewy!) and Mongolian kimchi to our order.  That was definitely a pleasant surprise, and the standout of the meal! Unlike Korean kimchi, it's not fermented and has more of a sweet flavor. All of the veggies were wonderfully crunchy, and it provided a nice contrast to the savory warmth of the hot pot.  \\n\\nSince it's getting colder these days, I'll definitely be back here soon for more fabulous food!"},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Summary: Great food with amazing management and servers.

The answer?  \\"No.\\"   Not, \\"I'm sorry, but we really can't do that.\\"  Just a short, unfriendly, \\"No.\\"   So we paid about a billion bucks for two GIANT pancakes that the child took one bite of....Oh, but Harlow got their MONEY!   That seemed to be the only interest they had.  Customer service did not appear to be high on the list at all.    \\n\\nThe heavily tattooed woman with the black hair that brought our food to the table was also very rude, just sort of slapping it down in front of us without a kind word for anyone....no smile...no, \\"Enjoy your meal!\\"  Nuthin.  Rude. Rude. Rude!  This is a first for Portland, a city noted for its friendliness. \\n\\nThe only friendly person in the whole place was a young-ish man with black hair (very handsome) who took the time to ask us how we liked our food. The food, as I said, was delicious.  However, what difference does that make when the staff is so unfriendly, discourteous and unhelpful?    We dine out a lot and we would have ended up spending a lot of money in this place eventually....but they were so rude that we will NEVER return.  Not EVER.  There is NO excuse for that kind of behavior....especially not in a city as friendly as Portland.  Harlow has no business being here with that attitude.   I prefer to spend future money at Portobello on the corner of Division and 11th.

It had been 35 years since I last had dinner here but little has changed. While I loved the experience I think a few improvements would make this a real five star experience.\\n\\n1. The interior is dark with wood and heavy red leather like banquets and chairs. There are no windows in the dinning area which is the antithesis of current design. I found it very comfortable and welcoming once I got past the massive doors that my poor 85 year old mother would never have opened on her own. \\n\\n2. The make an excellent martini. Drinks in general are generously poured by a somewhat gruff but attentive bartender. \\n\\n3. Service is interesting and here is where I believe they need to do some work. You are met by again a somewhat gruff hostess who is not the most welcoming She asked my name, said \\"I need a minute to get your table\\" then arrives 2 minutes later shouting my name even though I am standing 5 feet from her and there is only one other couple waiting. Very strange. Our waiter was very prompt;  too much so during the entire night. It seems they are intent on turning tables at such a rapid rate you feel like you as you eat the devil is one step behind you. We were not occupying a table for hours on end but it seems like they want to turn a table in under an hour. Slow down folks. The waiter forgot to bring us our salad showing up with our dinners without having brought the salads. I know exactly why he forgot. We simply threw him off his rapid fire pace. The push to get you in and out is very off putting. \\n\\n4. The food is excellent with varied menu but with an old school slant. Their pop overs are incredible as were all the small hors d'oeuvres they bring you before dinner. All were terrific. You need to pace yourself or you will not need dinner. The prime is excellent and substantial. The lobster pie was delicious; much lighter than the usual heavy cream version. Blueberrry cheese cake was wonderful. \\n\\nPrices are more than reasonable for what you receive.  Well worth the visit....just slow down the pace and let your guests enjoy the experience; and fix the doors. The average age of a diner last night was 2 years younger than God; I suspect many struggle opening the two sets of massive doors that lead into the main dinning area."},{"name":"Epicerie Cafe & Grocery","address":"2307 Hancock Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"All I can say is YUM.

Not quite as flashy as Izziban and not quite the quality of Korea House, but a pretty decent alternative in a more convenient area for those on the east of Orlando near UCF, Waterford, Avalon...etc. \\n\\nContext:\\nI tried out the KBBQ for their Wednesday night special (~$23 vs normal $28). I haven't tried out their other Hot Pot & Sushi options. \\n\\nService (5/5):\\nService was really good. We had our waitress check in on us a lot, always providing whatever we needed. She made a lot of super good suggestions and brought us a sample plate in the beginning. In addition, our original host checked in on us whenever our waitress was busy with other tables. There was never a time where we were waiting on the waitress for food, drink, check...etc.\\n\\nMeat Quality (4.5/5):\\nTheir meat is sliced super thin, which makes it a lot easier to cook and a unique texture compared to a lot of the other KBBQ in Orlando. The Kalbi is something you usually don't see at a lot of other places, especially for the price point during their specials. If nothing else, the Kalbi made the experience worth it. In addition, the beef tongue was super good and cut similar to the brisket. The hanger steak was pretty decent, but hard to cook without it getting too tough. The bulgogi wasn't quite my favorite here, but definitely still pretty good.\\n\\nSauce & Flavor (4/5): The marinade was missing a certain kick that you usually expect from Korean BBQ (umami perhaps?). In addition, although they have a pretty expansive sauce collection, their sauce just didn't feel quite on par with places like Izziban. \\n\\nSetting (4/5): The building used to be a Hooters, so taking that into account the environment is pretty nice. There's a lot of decently private booths, but the overall layout of the restaurant feels a little awkward.

It was not my decision to come here, nor did i even know this place existed, but it was only 1 shop up the street from my fav northern noodle joint on Fraser. Lets get this flavour train on the road! First off, dont let the shabby exterior and the blurred out windows deceive you, inside is magnificently renovated. Nice cushioned chairs, big tables, not pretentious decor, and busy! You are limited to street parking, so get lookin~ and prep your change purse.\\n\\nLets get to some food shall we?~ My family ordered some kind of Ginger pork feet which is kinda meh, it wasn't too sour or gingery but it certainly wasn't my cup of tea. not much meat, only cartilage, fat and skin. The main event had to be the wok fried curry crab, yes you heard me...CURRY CRAB! It smelled like curry, looked like curry, and boy did it taste like curry. Great flavour, great spices, but is only as good as the crab you chose/buy. Bigger is better here folks, but it does get pricy. \\n\\nWhile I was too busy tearing apart my crab legs, the half soy chicken arrived. I was given a piece and it was very nicely cooked, still moist but nice baked crispy soy flavoured skin. Mmmmhmmm good~ So, While im still chugging away at my 3rd crab leg, our soup arrived. It was a hot & sour soup. The soup's consistancy was just right, and the amount of ingredents floating around was just right aswell. Some shrimp, shredded chicken, tofu, onions, chilis. all the good stuff you'd expect from a good hot & sour soup. \\n\\nAt this point, I FINALLY finished the crab, soup, chicken, and w.e was on the table, wiped my hands on a wet nap and waited for the next thing. Promptly arriving was a stir fry seafood and Vegetable dish, served in its own wok! now thats hot! nice chunks of scallops, squid, shrimp, tofu, onions, cabbage, etc. It sure beats the hell out of those low end places with scallops, peas, and candied walnuts, that's so last year right? For our vegetarian friends, we have a lovely fried egg tofu with bok choi and shrooms. Yummy right? I was quite good, nicely seasoned, al dante cook on the bok choi, and very good portion size. There was also a honey garlic porkchop, which i might add was not overly sweet, overly hard like candy, and quite pleasing to eat. Soft porkchop with a simple honey garlic glaze, mmm mmm good~\\n\\nTo top off the evening, we had some KILLER CLAMS! and some scallop egg rice. Boy those clams were killer alright, huge, packed lots of flavour, and there were alot of them!! Not super spicy, just enough seasoning to make them irresistible like a bag of good olde Thunder Crunch. =( The rice was anti-climactic but it did have seasoning, which is better than most places.\\n\\nAll and all, it was a very good night. Walking around the restaurant on my way to the washroom, I saw some huge ass steamed scallops w/ toppings, and the table across from us had golden sand crab with rice cakes. I mean, If you're Chinese and dont think those sound good, your insane!!! The only blemish to this review is the fact that their POS system was down, so only cash was accepted...BOOOOOOOO! And some shabby service at times due to the full house, but the food was delievered at a breakneck speed, fresh from the wok. Conflicted? Yes.

They have the typical rice bowl type dish with a wide variations between them as well as pho and vermicelli bowls.  You can get nearly all of the rice bowls and vermicelli bowls vegetarian (they put the fish sauce on the side so you don't have to use it).  The rice bowl exceptions are the ones done with oyster sauce.  Also you can choose what meat (or lack of meat) you want in anything.\\n\\nThe best part of this place is that they have a Happy Hour between 2 and 4 where meals come with a free drink!  They also have a lunch special where all of their rice bowls are about $1.50 cheaper with any meat.  It's a smaller portion, but they're still filling.\\n\\nOh yeah, speaking of portions, you get a lot of food for your money.  The normal portions are big and certainly good if you want to eat half of it there and take the rest home.\\n\\nAgain, I give it a 5/5 because it is the best out of all other similar types of restaurants, in my opinion.  They get your food out within 5 minutes of ordering it, the front staff are always friendly and most of the time they wish you a good day/night when you leave if they aren't busy.  They offer a good variety for a fast food place and it is made fresh to order.  The spicy food is actually spicy and I enjoy eating there whenever I go.\\n\\nDefinitely try it at least twice!"},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Been here three times and never been disappointed.

We called at about 8:20 to let them know we would be running about 5 minutes late.  The hostess said that would be fine and thanked us for calling to let her know.  We walk in at 8:35 and are told that they are running behind and that it would take about 20-30 minutes before we could be seated.  The hostess apologized that they were running behind but we didn't have time to wait 30 minutes - why bother with a reservation?  So we left rather unhappy, as you might imagine.  We were polite to the hostess and left saying we would be back tomorrow when it wasn't so busy.\\n\\nOn our way home, we called to make a reservation for the next evening but also wanted to let them know that they should have been more upfront with the wait when we called on the phone.  Dan, the owner, then got on the phone and told us it was OUR fault that we didn't get seated because we came 5 minutes late.  In the most rude way possible, he says \\"this is like an airline, if you're not here on the dot, we leave without you\\".  He didn't seem to care about the fact that THEY were running behind and then took our spot in order to try and catch up.  And on top of it, he goes out of his way to insult us?  No, sorry, we won't be returning to this place.  If you're having a rough night, maybe you shouldn't get on the phone and attempt customer service after you messed up.  After looking at the owner's responses to other negative reviews, I can see that it wasn't just the result of a stressful evening.  He regularly insults people who had a bad experience - saying they would only be welcome back if they \\"traded in their boyfriend\\", called the reviewers liars in no uncertain terms, and generally treats them with condescension and sarcasm while saying he can't fit any more awards on his walls.  Really Dan?\\n\\nBottom line, from the owner himself, Tasca is run like an airline business.  They run behind and then steal your reservation in order to catch up.  If you're 5 minutes late, even after calling to inform them and being told it would be absolutely fine, your reservation will not be honored and you will have the owner get on the phone to insult you to boot.

I would have liked to see a little bit more bread with this \\"sandwich\\",but still I found it to be very flavorful tasty.\\n\\nBJ's also has a huge selection of their own brews, and they even do seasonals as well.

The baked crab dip was amazing; toasts were a little hard though, even scratched the ceiling of my mouth. I've had a lot of calamari but the calamari here tasted better somehow. It was crispy and the tartar sauce also complimented the crispness. The highlight was the the seared scallop over pancakes drizzled in maple syrup topped with pecan. It was just as delicious as it sounds. I'm definitely gonna order this again when I go back. The last dish was a fusion pork belly rice soup with veggies, poached eggs, and lots of red beans. Would've been better if there was no red beans. The pork belly, pray the lord, was so crispy and for me who's not even a fan of that fatty part, the fat just melted right in your mouth in the most literal sense. I don't how they made it like that but this gotta be one of the best pork belly meat I've ever tasted. Everything was almost perfect and then came the chocolate crepe cake. This is the only thing I don't recommend here.

This has pretty much ruined me for all but the most basic Mexican food you can get in America. Barring basic tacos (hard to mess up) I just haven't been able to find the flavor profiles and intensity that I got used to, plus some produce is just more difficult to source up here, plain and simple. \\n\\nMy partner went there for a happy hour event after work and was tentatively impressed, but knew my standards are a little different. Still, we went there for brunch and immediately when I looked at the menu I was hopeful things would be different. Mexican cheeses! Traditional chiles! Mole! Yucca! It was clearly fusion fare (eggs benedict aren't a thing down south), but it had promise to be GOOD fusion fare. \\n\\nI got the centro cazuela entree, which draws heavily from southern Mexico's cuisine. The yucca and plantain were cooked to perfection, and the mole was gentle enough for an American audience, but still drew on all the important flavors. The textures were also perfectly cohesive. My partner got the pork belly benedict, which was definitely more American than Mexican, but still perfectly prepared and delicious with little nods to Mexican flavors and preparations in the hollandaise and pork belly. My partner also got a pomegranate mimosa, and I got the hibiscus agua fresca (aka jamaica). The mimosa was delicious, and my one gripe about the whole meal was the jamaica. I suspect it was prepared the way it was to make it a little more palatable to American tastes, but the tart flavor of hibuscus was mellowed out considerably and sweetened past the point where I usually enjoy my jamaica. Still, I haven't been able to find dried hibiscus to make my own anywhere, so I can't complain too much. \\n\\nAlso, it's too bad people have had bad experiences with service- our waitress was sweet and attentive throughout our meal.

The establishment itself is very cramped and small. It is in a very busy shopping center which lacks parking. I felt a little claustrophobic in that little place. The fountain drink machine is a little over the top for the little space. However, I do love the novelty. \\n\\nWould I eat here again?

Also rather than normal butter they give you those peel-open butter packs, which is what I'd expect in a cafeteria, not a higher end coffee shop and cafe.

First off, it's housed in the Baldwin Mansion, a large, pretty colonial home in Woburn.  Unfortunately, it's also right off Rte 128 / I-95, which contributes a fair bit of traffic noise.  However, the old home provides a variety of small dining rooms, and there is a decent-looking, well-stocked bar on one side.  \\n\\nSo far, we've only tried 4 dishes, but they were all good.  I had hot and sour soup, which was very good, and my husband had crab rangoon to start, which were lovely and crisp.  Then, being in the mood for something \\"traditional\\" (read:  traditional American Chinese takeout), I ordered Kung Pao chicken, while my husband tried something off the Chef's Signature list, Stir Fried Prawns in some sort of sauce.  I have to say, the Kung Pao was just fine, but the prawns (shrimp to us Yanks) were delicious- next time I'm definitely going for a \\"Signature\\" dish!\\n\\nI didn't peruse the wines available but the beer selection was limited mainly to basic American stuff (Budweiser, Sam Adams) and Tsingtao.  There were some cocktails at reasonable prices, and I tried a Manhattan, which was pretty awful.\\n\\nPrices were reasonable; some items were more expensive than you may be used to seeing in the average take-away joint, but I'm gonna hedge my bets and say the quality is probably a lot better.  I'll update my post if we try more dishes!\\n\\nI think it would be a good place to bring a large group, you could take over one of the rooms.  We'll have to try their take-out, but I think part of what made the food extra-good was the piping hot temperature and crispiness of the fried appetizer.\\n\\n*4/3/07 We have since tried a few more dishes, including Chengdu Wonton in Broth (very nice, and they gave us a HUGE takeout portion), Chef's Ma Paul Tofu (more on the liquid sauce-y side, spicy and good), Sauted String Beans with Chengdu City Spices (good, a wee bit greasy), and another shrimp dish (think it was  Sauted Prawns with Spicy Garlic Sauce- excellent).

Not wanting to deal with the craziness of the Ale House every night, I wandered into Kobe.\\n\\nWhat's nice about the place is that it's not just teppanyaki, there's a very small and very ignored little side building tacked onto the main restaurant -- that's where you'll find the sushi bar and some cozy, intimate seating (booths! Yay!) away from the chaos. If you don't want to deal with the loud craziness of the group tables but still like the food, this is an ideal place for it.\\n\\nAs to the food, it's pretty good. You can get Wagyu beef here if you're so inclined, just be prepared to pay the price for it. They treat it like it's a tiny slice of heaven and cook it just perfectly, I've never had it overdone, it's always exact shade of pink it needs to be to tell you it's a little patch of happiness waiting to be devoured.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is great, classy enough for business meetings with clients, and the chefs (if you're sitting at a table) are amusing enough. I've been there so many times I generally know the younger guy's routines, but the old dudes just seem to make stuff up on the fly and can sometimes be pretty hilarious with the right crowd. \\n\\nEither way, given the location (it's literally right across the street from Universal Studios) I'm surprised at the quality of the food here and the nice atmosphere. You get a lot of tourists, but you don't really get that vibe once you're seated. For being so close to a major attraction, it manages to avoid the cuts in quality you so often see at such places, and it's a decent price for what you're getting.\\n\\nAlso, one last tip: ASK FOR WHITE SAUCE. Demand it. They'll offer you something else along with it, just say \\"Double white sauce, please\\" and they will GIVE IT TO YOU. If you love it, they even sell bottles of it to take home. The white sauce, it is king of all things here. It is the warm center of the world, and you can put it in your mouth.

I feel like this place was just on the verge of three stars and, with just a little effort, could be a solid four, but based on my brunch experience, I have to go with a two. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, the service didn't start things off well. We were told that the hostess screwed up and didn't assign the table. Really? You don't split the dining room up into zones? Whatever. \\n\\nA waitress looked right at us sitting there and walked away. A waiter seemed intent on not looking at us. I was ready to walk out when somebody finally acknowledged that we might be ready to get something other than water. \\n\\nThe house cocktails were pricey, and not quite good enough to justify the price. Not bad, but more like 7 dollar drinks rather than the 10 dollar price. \\n\\nGenerally the food was a bit underseasoned. The Butternut Squash  and apples soup lacked depth that emerged when table salt was added,however, a little more salt in the cooking process, a touch of sugar and a bit of acid would have nailed it. These are basics, people.  This is the first time I have added table salt to a meal in the last 20 years. Seriously. I'll add pepper now and then, but the salt shaker felt foreign in my hand. \\n\\nThe breakfast was better. Eggs were cooked well. I would have liked a little crispiness on the potatoes, and some prime rib that was a bit more on the rare side.  The other dish had short rib on it that was almost criminally under-seasoned.  It was good, but definitely not great and a with touch less salt it would have been Kal Kal. Just a little more salt in the braise and you've got it.  Again, this is cooking 101. Come on. \\n\\nHere's what I don't get. Toast is ala carte for two bucks. What the hell, man? I've got egg yolks and bearnaise to mop up. Give a brother some complimentary toast. I mean, I spent almost 70 bucks, is it too much to ask to give each of us two slices of toasted bread? IT'S BREAKFAST, DAMMIT!\\n\\nThe space is really hip and cool. I think every table wobbles like a mofo, and the rustic planks are uneven and can result in spilled drinks if you slide something from one side of the table to the other. I mean, you can pick it up like a man, but I have a feeling a lot of drinks get knocked over here. This place is also too pretty for waiters to be stuffing napkins under the legs. The GM needs to hustle his fat ass over to the hardware store and get some adhesive leveling pads. I'm not kidding. I'm cool with a wobbly table at a dive bar, but you have to come stronger than that at a place like Copius.\\n\\nI'm definitely not going back for brunch. I mean, it's not horrible but Columbus is a brunch/breakfast mecca. Around here you either deliver classic greasy spoon diner fare, or you come strong like Wolf's Ridge, or Skillet.  I might give these cats a shot for dinner some time, but I hope the service is a little less detached. Copious reminds me of myself in school. I could have pulled straight A's, but I always settled for C's. \\n\\nThe dude who bussed our tables actually stopped me from leaving a shity tip. He was pleasant, seemed happy, and was responsive.

I've had better on both counts, but not at this price level.\\n\\nThe fries are excellent, and they deserve their own paragraph.  These are probably the best fries I've had at any price, and each order is massive.  The fries are very simple in concept, very perfect in execution:  hand cut potatoes, neither too thin nor too thick, deep-fried in peanut oil until the outside is a crisp golden-brown, and the inside is still hot and fluffy.  They are served in an overflowing styrofoam cup, inside a paper bag.  Each bite is sublime simplicity, and there are about 1.5*10^14 bites in each order of fries.\\n\\nInterestingly, Five Guys often displays the origin of the doomed potatoes, using a big sign that prominently states which bumfuck town in Idaho the potatoes came from that day.

The first time was in 2008 and would have been a 3-star review if I'd known about Yelp at the time.  My wife is Korean and I'd just returned from living in Korea for 5 years.  We had a mean craving and brought some friends along to introduce them to the experience.  The table-grilled bbq was okay, but the service was terrible.  After half an hour of grilling, we asked for a clean grill and the waitress looked at us like we'd slapped her.  We let it go, thinking maybe it was unfair to compare the service to what we'd see in Korea.  That was 4 years ago and I wouldn't have held it against them if it hadn't been for our experience last weekend.\\n\\nThis most recent visit: $35 for spicy chicken kalbi (ddalk galbi) that looked and smelled like some kind of chicken curry soup.  The chicken was already cooked when they brought it out and put it on the table to cook some more.  I thought they'd gotten the order wrong and when we asked what it was, the waitress assured us that it was ddalk galbi.  It looked nothing like ddalk galbi.  It was just awful.  Really really bad.  And no spice at all.\\n\\nImagine you're at home wondering what you should make with all these leftover veggie scraps.  You decide to chop up some chicken and throw it into a stewpot with your veggies and some curry powder.  That's what they brought us.  That's fine if you're at home and want some stewed chicken and veggie curry, but you don't call it ddalk galbi and charge someone 35 bucks for it.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that my empty water glass sat on the table for the 45 minutes it took them to boil the shit out of our chicken *before* it got to our table.\\n\\nMy wife wanted the typical steamed egg casserole side dish (gaeran jjim), but they actually charge extra for it so we skipped it.  Go to any other Korean restaurant and it's part of your meal at no extra charge.  Not this place.\\n\\nWe also ordered the seafood pancake (haemul pajeon), which is the only reason this review isn't 1 star.  It was delicious, but way too small for its $9.00 price tag.\\n\\nIf they charged what other Korean restaurants charge, this would be a 3-star review (or no review at all, which is more my style), but being charged $45 for such bad food and service is insulting.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that a real Korean place will open up in Portland.  Until then, we'll stick with Nakwon in Beaverton and stay far far away from this place."},{"name":"St. Honor√© Boulangerie","address":"2335 NW Thurman St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very disappointed.

The same went for the calamari itself since the batter was bland, but the aioli served with it was the worst sauce we've ever had.  It basically tasted like ketchup, vinegar, and mayonnaise blended together.  And it practically covered the bottom of the plate, sopping the slightly chewy calamari.  Yuck.  The pork loin was quite dry and had a flat, \\"dirty\\" flavor, and the white bean sauce was just OK.  And, lastly, the goat cheese empanadas were more like goat cheese wonton dumplings.  They should be served at an Asian fusion joint, NOT a Spanish tapas restaurant.  And the relish was sweet, flat, and did not suit the \\"empanadas.\\"  The sangria was ok, but it was too sweet, and had a strange opaque quality to it (is sangria supposed to look like that?).\\n\\nThe decor and paintings on the walls were a thoughtful touch, and suited the dim, warm lighting.  But the tables were really crammed together, and made it difficult to maintain the cozy, intimate ambience I think the restaurant owners were going for.\\n\\nOne last thing:  I was surprised that the waitress was a bit squirrely and barely welcomed us to the restaurant.  Typically, at most tapas restaurants, the server will kindly introduce themselves and inquire whether you have been to their venue before, or if you are familiar with what \\"tapas\\" is and how it works.  Our waitress tonight didn't do that - she only came up to our table asking if we wanted something to drink.  She brought the tapas out very sporadically (they mostly took very long to arrive) and she never really checked back to see if we were enjoying our food, if we needed anything else, or even to refill our waters.  Honestly, it was pretty bad service.  I've had much better than that at many places that charge less."},{"name":"Maggiano's Little Italy","address":"1601 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Phenomenal experience here.

I ordered the reba nira itame (garlic chives, bean sprouts, and liver stir fry) and the mini katsu-don.\\n\\nThe cooking took a while (maybe 15 minutes?); the kitchen was still quite busy. But as soon as the stir fry came out, it was obvious that it was worth the wait: the sprouts were still crunchy, the chives just wilted enough, great sear and caramelization of the soy sauce (great wok hei); the only downside is that the liver was just slightly overcooked, but liver is almost impossible to cook right anyway.\\n\\nWhile I paced myself with the stir fry, the katsu-don came out a few minutes later: it was so... homely? Can something you've never had be a comfort food? Sweet and savory, lightly crunchy onions, crispy (but slightly moistened and softened) tonkatsu, soft poached eggs, a few strands of chives. Warm and comforting.\\n\\nOverall impressions:\\nGreat service, though food takes a while to come out.

But the experience was not as magical as I expected.  The dining room is cavernous to say the least which lends to the feeling of being in a giant cafeteria in Reno or Las Vegas.  I had expected a more intimate and luxurious space.  In addition, the acoustics were awful.  It was so loud in there, we just stopped talking to eachother.  \\n\\nI had dinner there which I would not recommend because it is relatively expensive and the food is only so-so.  Coming from California, I have eaten a lot of Greek food and there was no resemblance.  Cat makes her lemon chicken soup with orzo which just does not give it the same delicate texture that rice offers.  And I found the soup on the gamey side.  I am Chinese, I can eat gamey, but it did not hit the bullseye with me. \\n\\nFor my entree, I had the appetizer sampler because there was nothing on the menu calling out to me.  I figured with a sampler, there had to be something I liked.  Unfortunately, the only thing I liked was the grilled shrimp that came with it.  Otherwise, the pita was toasted so much, it was hard as cardboard.  The hummus and tzatziki were very thick and grainy, much more like a bagel spread than the dips I am used to, so I didn't like those either.  On the plate were the same olives that they provided for free with the bread, which was rather disappointing because one would hope the restaurant would at least think to give you a variety to try.  The best thing that evening was the free bread.  It was warm and soft on the inside with a nice crust that had a slight crunch on the outside touched with a hint of salt and some seeds accompanied by a really good olive oil for dipping.\\n\\nIn the spirit of full disclosure, I will admit that despite my dinner experience, I came for breakfast the next morning.  Since I was staying at a nearby hotel, I came again because I heard there was a pastry I needed to try since I love phyllo and custard.  It was quite tasty but I ordered a side of thin crispy bacon to go with it in order to get a savory item, too. I would probably go back for breakfast because the prices were more reasonable and it wasn't half bad, but I would skip dinner here.\\n\\nThe service was pleasant but a little on the slow side.  If you go, make a reservation, because walk-ins have to wait a pretty long time, if they can get in at all."},{"name":"Upper Crust Pizzeria","address":"683 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The pizza is good, often over seasoned though. I would give them a much higher score if not for their staff!!! Whenever I go in person to get pizza they are helpful enough and I have no problems. Every time I have phone called them I have been yelled at on the phone and treated rudely. First time ordering pizza via phone we asked if they had bread sticks, which I was thoroughly reprimanded for even asking if they sell something other than pizza. My friends have been yelled at by them on the phone for a question as well. Tonight I had mis-read my groupon, the delivery man had me call the store so I could get YELLED AT by them that it is not valid on delivery, he said he called me twice to tell me(Which he most certainly had not) and he just kept yelling at me till I hung up on him.\\nI don't think I will order delivery from them again, walking by to get a slice- fine.

This is a huge turnoff for me.  Having been a host and a server I know how important it is that guests feel welcome when they come to your restaurant.  She was also dressed, at least in my opinion, a little inappropriately for Haiku, which I've been lead to believe is one of the nicer establishments in Columbus.

Having said that, Amelia's doesn't deserve to call itself a restaurant, and if I could give it zero stars I would. I first dined at Amelia's in February 2009, and I remember the food and service to be acceptable. Perhaps it was because the owner was present that evening trying to impress his friends? My recent experience with Amelia's could only be worse if the food made me ill. We arrived at 7:00 PM and the waitress told us to sit anywhere, and that she would be with us when she could \\"find the time\\". There were two other tables occupied (parties of two and three), and all had their food. It took her 10 minutes to take our drink order, and then another 10 minutes to deliver them. Oh, and she forgot the glasses of water we requested. She dropped off a basket of stale bread, without offering olive oil or butter to moisten the carboard-like texture. We placed an order for the aranccini appetizer. Meanwhile, the other patrons were trying desperately to get the waitress' attention to pay their bills. The waitress appeared completely frazzled and in the weeds, despite the fact that the only order in the kitchen at that time was our aranccini! The owner/manager popped in during this time, talking very loudly on his bluetooth earbud. He seemed more concerned about his conversation than the fact that the restaurant was in complete shambles, and he left within minutes of his arrival. At this point, we were almost an hour into our dining experience, we were the only couple in the restaurant, our drinks were empty without any offer of a refill, and we were still waiting for our aranccini! An hour for an appetizer!? Not wanting to prolong the agony, I placed money on the table for our drinks. The waitress took this as a cue to check with the kitchen on our aranccini, and she returned with a cold baseball-sized ball of baked rice. I cut into it, and saw that it was made with Goya yellow rice. Despite my look of disbelief, she asked if we were ready to order our entrees. I said no thanks, just the check, which took another 5 minutes to calculate. To be fair, it was clear that the waitress had not been trained and had little-to-no serving experience. Having said that, if a restaurant is not staffed to provide its customers both quality food and service, it should not open its doors. In my honest opinion, Amelia's should be closed until they can resolve their very serious problems, and I urge all Yelp readers to avoid this place. On a side note, after we left Amelia's, we went to Theo's (about a block away) and were served our food in about 10 minutes."},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"This place is extra sillypants!

As I noted, they have a cheese and meat program in the cold case, and the limited cheese selection boasts some character. My petite cantal was not only affordable, but also extremely fresh, still boasting much of the pungency that is so easily lost. Their baked goods are nothing to overlook either. The little shortbread packs a very buttery punch, what with its crumbly texture and rich flavor.\\n\\nThe epicerie brings yet another fun dynamic to the dining of the Rosedale/Allandale area, and I can see this joint exploding with long waits, dinner events, and the fulfillment of all sorts of foodie fantasies."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for a texas style barbecue sandwich.

Sitting at the bar, I got the usual (sushi lunch combo). Service was okay. I asked if I could pay a couple extra bucks and order another roll than the standard combo fare, and received a very sharp \\"no,\\" almost like a mom would say to a kid trying to smuggle candy into the shopping cart.

Nothing jumped out, but not bad by any means.\\n\\nI asked for the check and, after sliding my card into the holder, was told that it was a minimum of $20 for credit cards. No sign, no mention on the menu, nothing to alert me to that fact. I can't stand restaurants that do this to begin with, but at least put a sign up. While it looks like Gari is all about discounted sushi now, their prices were pretty high when they opened. I tend to assume that I can charge it if my food is over $10. \\n\\nSo I tell the waitress that I have to go to the bank and, after exchanging a few words with the hostess and a few glares at me, am told that they'll run it because \\"I already ate and I might not come back.\\" Really?

He confirmed that it was, so I ordered it. Upon the food coming, I go to stir the soup and find what looked to be meat in it. The two others that I was dining with tried it, and they had no doubt that it was definitely meat in the soup. When the waiter stopped by, I asked if it was for sure vegetarian, to which he continued to insist that it was. He said that he confirmed it with multiple members of the waitstaff that the soup was vegetarian, so we asked to speak to a manager. When she came over and I showed her what was obviously meat, she confirmed that it was. \\n\\nThe manager offered to replace it with something else, but by this point, because of the waiter incorrectly insisting that the soup was vegetarian, the other members of my party were close to finishing so I declined it to be replaced. \\n\\nWhen the waiter brought out our bills, guess what, he still charged me for the soup. I went straight to the manager this time to fix the issue, and she comped the soup and the appetizers. However, when the waiter then ran our cards, he AGAIN charged us for the soup. \\n\\nNeedless to say, this terrible experience will certainly mean that we will not be coming back, and I urge anybody that is trying to get Mexican food in the boulder area to go to one of the many other great restaurants (T/aco, bartaco, etc.)"},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Where here before the Atlanta Symphony and had a fantastic dinner!

I was hoping that 11:00 would be too late for breakfast and too early to be busy for lunch so I could make a quick turnaround and be on the road again.\\n\\nThe ordering process is disorganized.  I saw between three and four people taking food orders in a somewhat random sequence.  Since there were so many people taking food orders, you would think that the process would work smoothly, but they somehow achieved the exact opposite.\\n\\nIt was helpful that the young lady taking my order immediately informed me that they were out of sourdough.  I should have seen this as a precursor to the unfortunate rest of my meal.  How do you run out of bread at 11:00 AM?  Complete disorganization is how.\\n\\nI ordered five sandwiches to take with me.  The sandwiches I ordered were all options that were listed on the menu, so this should not be complicated.  Thirty minutes after I placed my order, the staff informed me that they needed to take the sandwiches off plates, and then wrap them to go.  Also they forgot to make one sandwich.  Also they forgot to cut the last sandwich they made.  Also one sandwich I ordered was left off the order and another was duplicated.\\n\\nFurther, in the thirty minutes I waited, I watched as only two orders left the kitchen before mine.  So they were averaging one order every ten minutes.  The store was not understaffed, just completely mismanaged and unorganized.\\n\\nOverall, none of the sandwiches were something I would order again.  The food was good, but not great.

HBH can be a more sedate place to eat and drink if you choose the patio or the dining room upstairs (which we were told is music-free). The big oaken tables seat about 10-12; smaller tables and the bar are available for singles or pairs.\\n\\nFood: It's German. It's pork. And more. Portions were fairly large with prices to match; HBH is not a cheap meal. The wursts were tame; although they did offer a jalapeno cheese one, I didn't want that as my sole protein for the night. I saw others ordering the pork shank which was darned big, looked good. Saw a couple salads which were also large. Soft pretzels and beer cheese are a nice starter; would have liked some real German mustard for those, but only Gulden's was on our table. And that poor sauerkraut... lol. I expect just a bit more life left in my kraut, but the stuff on the plate at HBH was cooked to death. \\n\\nBeer: HBH serves their own beer. Period. The 4 standard drafts are light lager, regular lager (labeled \\"premium\\" on the menu, but it's your standard 5 percenter), hefeweizen and a dunkel. Our group liked all but the dunkel, which lacked character. There is also a monthly brew; June's urbrau was a nice red Marzen-ish beer. Didn't see anyone try a 'boot' glass but the shot ski, which groups 4 drink shots together, was in use. Liquor seen behind the bar appeared to be typical offerings.\\n\\nLocation: At the front corner of Grandview Yard. Parking is easy enough; even some covered space as part of the property (not physically connected to HBH). Patio seating, upstairs non-beerhall seating. Saw a wide variety of people there just getting their dinner on, so you don't have to party hard to enjoy HBH. Stein lockers available for those who like that sort of thing. Minimal TV presence, this is not really a place to watch the game.

She wanted Chinese buffet food and she got it. Maybe my culinary experiences have been limited but if there is one word that comes to my mind when I think about Chinese buffets that's cheap. And yes, Great Mandarin was cheap at $8.95 a person. And that's about the only good thing I have to say about it.\\n\\nIn terms of the selection of items, it was fine though less than the average Chinese buffet I have been to. Fortunately none of us were vegetarians but if we were, we would be in a hard spot. Something which was surprising was that there were absolutely no desserts. It is hard for me to think of the time that I have been to a buffet (Indian / Chinese/ American) where not even a single dessert was on the menu.\\n\\nThe taste of the items was very average. Perhaps the only thing that I remember in a somewhat favorable light were the crab rangoons. In what I think is the best commentary on the authenticity and quality of the food, we did not see a single person who appeared Chinese  among the guests. It was a bunch of elderly Indians but mostly Caucasians who were lapping up what was being offered. Service was fine in that our waters were refilled quite promptly. We also found the wait staff replenishing the dishes that were running low quite regularly. \\n\\nAll in all, my mother wanted (cheap?) Chinese buffet food and she got it here - nothing much to complain about other than maybe the lack of desserts.

Chix Fings, Motzy Stix, French fries, poppers...they are all delicious.\\n\\nThe calzones are really good too, but for some reason they are afraid to put sauce inside of them...it comes with the sauce on the side, which at first was alittle weird, but ive grown accustomed to it. \\n\\nThe pizzas are hit or miss. They can be really delicious, but lately i feel like they are very busy, and rush the pizzas. Sometimes they are undercooked, and I usually have to pop it in my oven for about 10 minutes when I get it home..other than that this place is awesome. \\n\\nOne thing to avoid...chicken on a pizza. Im always expecting cut up chicken fingers on top of the pizza, which of course would be delicious, but they chop up grilled chicken...sometimes 2 or 3 breasts worth, and pile it on there. its gross. hopefully they'll read this and start topping their pizzas with their delicious chicken fingers instead. \\n\\nThey also sell 2 liter bottles of Grape Soda, which for me, earns them huge bonus points"},{"name":"Edamame Sushi & Grill","address":"3946 Morse Crossing","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"We always go here when we are shopping at Easton and need a yummy sushi fix.

I really was not a fan; wanted to like it, but just could not.  Let me discuss why:\\n\\nAtmosphere:  By far the best thing this place has going for it.  As you walk in, the courtyard area is very nice and makes the place seem nice and exclusive.  The interior is cool and trendy.  Unfortunately, I came for dinner and drinks and not just the atmosphere...\\n\\nFood/Drinks:  Had several appetizers, including the warm mozzarella, meat and cheese plate, and seafood fritto misto.  Main entree was risotto di mare (seafood risotto).  The names are cool, but you can put lipstick on a pig all you want--it's still a pig.  The food was rather boring, you get very small portions, and the price is FAR too high.  The risotto di mare was actually kind of gross--way too chewy, which is not how well-prepared calamari is supposed to come out.  The drink situation is the same:  a bunch of fancy sounding wines that are overpriced for what they are and a paltry selection of beers.  Since the food is what you're coming for, don't pay this place the price of a nice meal for something terrible.  Save yourself the heartache and go to La Traviata instead!\\n\\nService:  Horrible.  The waiter seemed genuinely disinterested in serving us and came around to the table about 5 times over the course of our 3 hours there.  The other problem is that IT TOOK 3 HOURS TO EAT HERE!  Too slow and far too unenthusiastic for what you are paying.\\n\\nPrice:  Just wanted to reiterate what I have said in the last two paragraphs:  this place is extremely overpriced.  The price is a red herring:  it's that high to make you think you are getting a great meal, but the substance to actually back up that price simply is not there.  \\n\\ntl;dr:  DON'T GO HERE.

So, if you're there past the time they stop charging a cover-head inside. You can order your pizza slice there too and it's warm!

They have two bars and the second one is in a smaller room with a pool table and extra tables. That smaller room isn't exactly separated from the big room by anything besides a few columns and the wall of booze for the bar.

So you won't see your run of the mill (but still very tasty) channa masala, palak paneer, aloo mutter, etc., here.  They have a broad selection, with lots of vegetarian dishes, but always a few meat options to please those who can't bear the thought of a totally veg meal.

I saw profiteroles and had to have some. Hungry Man saw the cannoli shells and was confused. Why were the shells empty? Caffe Paradiso fills them upon order. They are fresh! We opted for table service and Caffe Paradiso was more than accommodating. The friendly service and relaxing atmosphere was perfect after conquering Bunker Hill.\\n\\nI was going to order two chocolate dipped cannoli when Hungry Man interjected and said we should get one plain and one chocolate instead. We would be sharing everything anyway. Hungry Man share? I wish there was someone else there we knew to witness this monumental moment. Luckily Yelp is here to immortalize it. \\n\\nThe cannolis were divine! Much better than Mike's Pastry. I've actually never had a plain cannolo before and the one at Caffe Paradiso was excellent. It was simple with powdered sugar and the filling was smooth. The shells were strong. I had to hold them down while I cut them in half with my fork. I didn't want a Pretty Woman moment and have half a cannolo catapult across the room. The chocolate connolo shell was dipped inside and out with chocolate. Even better than the plain. As for the profiteroles, they should have stayed in the glass case. Plated, they looked like blobs with a sad attempt of whipped cream. The profiteroles weren't filled. They were just okay and salvaged by the mousse-y exterior. Skip this if you ever go to Caffe Paradiso. \\n\\nI washed everything down with an iced coffee. Iced coffee at cafes are really growing on me and the coffee at Caffe Paradiso is pretty good. It's strong without being too bitter and they give you a really tall glass.\\n\\nCaffe Paradiso is decorated with flags everywhere. I thought it was just for the World Cup but I think this is just their thing. I've heard of futbol bars before, but futbol caffes? There are some nice tvs throughout so you can enjoy your cannolo while watching a sports game. I don't know why more people don't go to Caffe Paradiso but I'm glad it hasn't been taken over by the crowds. \\n\\nThanks to Dan C for telling me about this place.

The salsa is tomatillo based, great spicy finish but it's a bit on the thin side.\\n\\nThe average items I had were the burrito where the rice tasted like par-boiled rice.  The al pastor tacos were ok. The al pastor is more like a mole sauce.  I am used to having my al pastor tacos cooked in a rotisserie (shawarma style) and having little strips of crunchy roasted pork with a hint of pineapple sweetness.\\n\\nIf they want to earn five stars from me they would have to improve 3 areas.  First, their salsa needs to be a bit thicker so your tacos don't get soggy. Second, they really need to add more cilantro and onions to every taco. Lastly they need to source their tortillas better, these tortillas are basic store bought products that don't hold up well to being wrapped in foil.\\n\\nI will update my review as I try more of their products but for now make sure you get carnitas tacos or asada tacos for sure."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"I'm ashamed to say that today was my first time to visit since I moved to Dripping from North Austin back in October.

He then stated that people had been calling saying they got the wrong pizza so they could get it for free. \\n\\nI asked to speak to the highest ranking manager that was on site and John said that would be him.

Yes, I said AND not OR. First the brought out crispy Chinese crackers and have three dipping sauces on the table- duck sauce, mustard, and super spicy looking stuff. \\nI had the egg drop soup which was hot and yolky. It was not overly salty and had a nice flavor. My son had the wonton which was a clear broth with a single wonton. The soup was hot and also not too salty. It was missing veggies but that is fine. \\nThe egg rolls were huge and fried nicely just like the chicken wing. Neither was dripping in oil. For the entrees, my son had chicken lo mein. They make theirs with super skinny noodles. There were huge pieces of chicken and veggies included. I had the veggie fried rice which had huge pieces of freshly cut veggies, not the frozen cubes. \\nBoth portions were HUGE!  By the time we left, the place was packed with a lunch crowd. \\nWe took leftovers home on both and there was enough for our family of 4 to have for dinner. \\nI highly recommend this place!!"},{"name":"Extreme Pita","address":"515 Congress, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Uh-oh.

Well I hate to do it but if I can give an honest good review for my FAVORITE spot then I have got to be honest and tell you when my FAVORITE spot has fallen well below their usual standards. I would have given them a 1 Star this time. But once we got the right orders the food was delicious as always.....So here we go:\\n\\nI arrived at about 11:32 for an 11:30 appointment. My friend Monica was there at 11:20 so it's okay we didn't miss the appointment. As soon as I walked in we were seated to the right of the hostess area. We were seated and already knew what we wanted. Yep the Classic Pasta deal! One you eat there and another one you get to take home.  I used Open Table again, and left our FOOD ALLERGY issues in the \\"Special Notes\\" or something like that section. I always do this to inform the restaurant ahead of time that I can't have certain types of food.\\n\\nWe again tell the lovely waitress what has already been mentioned when I made our reservations. She says okay and goes to get bread for us. About 15 minutes later she comes back and I ask her if she could bring the bread. She comes back in about 5 minutes with Tea and shortly after that a young man brings the bread. Another 10 minutes pass and there is a young man placing a bowl in front of me. I quickly say to Monica, WTF this looks like Shrimp to me???? Are they trying to kill me? As we both look at our bowls in awe because they are both so wrong that we couldn't even swap them with one another. Sooooooo the waitress comes over and we explain that I will stop breathing from just smelling the bowl that was placed in front of me. She quickly takes them both and 10-15 minutes later brings two more bowls that guess what, are still wrong! But this time we could at least switch them out and poor Monica just had to pull out what she couldn't eat. By this time I was frustrated and really didn't want to finish my meal. Luckily my Fried Zucchini was perfect. As the waitress, whom by the way was very apologetic, started to pack up our bags we had her do everything individually in order that we would not get the wrong meals. Our \\"To Go\\" meals came and I guess it was my \\"Test your F'ing Patience Day\\" because my To Go order was wrong as hell. So now I am praying that Little Baby Jesus and Big Jesus would send someone down to hold my damn mule! Another 15 minutes goes by and my To Go order comes out and it's correct. \\n\\nI get the check and put my card in and ask the waitress to make sure to take off the B'Day coupon. She begins to have a 2-3 minute discussion with me about she can't take if off until I am ready to pay.  By this time I am well past my limit and I give her the check, I mean I literally put it in her hand about 3 times before I finally say \\"I AM READY take the check! And she opens it up and goes \\"Oh I didn't see your card in here!\\"......WooooooSaaaaaa.  I never leave a tip on my CC and I start looking for some cash and realize I have left it at home. Now even though her service sucked azz, I understand having a bad day. And who's to say the issue was not with the kitchen instead of her. But we didn't leave a tip because neither of us had cash. If I ever go back here and see her I will leave her a double tip. \\n\\nHOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE.......Maybe not because when I got home my perfectly Fried Zucchini was packed without the sauce. Now what kind of sense does that make!  The food did taste good as usual but there were only two of us at our table. \\"No Shrimp. No Marinara Sauce. No Parsley\\". should not end up in 5 dishes having to go back. I think we spent a good 40-60 minutes just waiting on the proper dishes. I am so freaking happy I like her azz!

I've tried quite a few, (Radicle Juice, Juice Truck, Glory Juice Company), and none of them remotely compare - most are lacking in acai flavour, or cut with too many other ingredients. So far, The Anchor Eatery wins. Pros: the acai had a deep purple colour, which means more real acai was blended in the smoothie. The smoothie had a rich, fresh flavour, and wasn't watery or overpowered by other fruits. The granola was yummy and had almonds in it, which added a good texture. LOVE the bee pollen on top. Cons: my serving was considerably smaller than my friend's order, as though mine was a rushed afterthought and there wasn't enough left in the blender, (for $10, I expect a full serving), and the strawberries were thrown in on top of the granola, whereas my friends was perfectly aligned in a row. (Not a big deal, but presentation is a nice touch!)

My husband had the Vegetable Bridie and we both truly enjoyed the texture and flavor of the crust.\\n\\nAlthough not a vegetarian, since it was a hot day, I tried the Gardener's Pie as my main course.

The malt vinegar added just the right seasoning.

I am not against spending big money- but I expect something back for it.\\nNorthstar is not exactly big money, but always leaves me feeling like I'm on the losing end of the negotiation if you know what I mean.  \\n\\nThe food ranges from pretty tasty to really underwhelming.  The hamburger is good.  The toppings unique, crunchy and fresh.  Something I would order again- especially if it were $3-4 cheaper.  The pizzas/flatbreads are nice as well- good snap and flavor.\\nThe burritos and bowls are really underwhelming to me.  The only way I can see people rave about these is if they never cook for themselves.  Take some brown rice, put some grilled chicken or tofu on top, cover with steamed (very lightly-almost raw) (or microwaved) veggies- and pour on some sauce.  That's what you get.  There's very little cooking going on- it feels like assembly to me.  The flavors are fresh, but there's no art to it.  I go out to get food I can't (or wouldn't) make.   I've eaten so much food like that in my life that came out of my own kitchen it's hard to get excited for.  \\n\\nI continue to go to Northstar (about 2-3x a year?).  Sometimes you want to go somewhere clean and nice, somewhere where you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent, and that's good.   But for the prices they charge, I need a little more than consistency to make me a more regular customer. \\n\\nNotes:\\n-An entr√©e and a beer, $20~.  Limited waitressing, order at a counter, fight for a table.  Going with my wife, I'm dropping $35 easy.  There are a lot of other options in town in the $20/person range.  \\n\\n-Where's the creativity with the menu?  Does it ever change?  For an \\"organic-leaning\\" kind of place, you'd think they'd have weekly/daily specialties that reflect what produce they are able to get.  There is nothing like that.  At least that I've noticed.  Do they have chefs on site?\\n\\n-It almost strikes me as a concept restaurant secretly created by a fast food chain.  How can we get people to order $15 burgers from a counter rather than $3 burgers?  Magazine rack!\\n\\n-Personally, 2 1/2.  Money is no object rating is 3.  The 'Columbus is still limited in it's options for this kind of fresh, clean, not-gut-busting but filling, semi-organic, modern offerings rating is 4 (Hence all the high ratings the place does get.)"},{"name":"Piada Italian Street Food","address":"1315 W Lane Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I really like Piada and they execute the fast, casual experience very well.

Had I read previous reviews more carefully, I would have known not to order it.  The description read that an egg would be included and that the noodles were Japanese style wavy noodles.  The noodles were not standard ramen noodles - they were white and had almost a spaghetti-like texture/width to them.  AND NO EGG.  I'm sorry, but egg is a MUST when I eat ramen - it's part of the reason I want it in the first place.  So I asked the waitress if the ramen was supposed to come with egg, she said, \\"No\\" and I told her the menu included it in the description, to which she responded that they needed to change it.  It should have been clarified when I ordered it that there wouldn't be an egg, but more importantly, how difficult is it to buy some eggs in a restaurant?  I was beyond annoyed at this point and lost my appetite for my very bland ramen (the Tonkatsu pieces were also bland, remedied by dousing it in soy sauce).\\n\\nThe rest of the time was spent watching the staff very poorly manage and seat incoming customers.

Here their clam bellies were so good. I figured they do seafood really well so I sprang for the bakes halibut $20. It was melt in you mouth delicious. It was cooked to perfection with a nice crunchy crust and served with lemon and two sides. Even the sides were good. The spring vegetables were not over cooked like they usually are in other places. It tasted fresh and was cooked just enough to be tender. The rice pilaf was nicely flavored as well. There isn't much to say about pilaf. Most seafood restaurants don't do it right. It's usually under done or bland. But this pilaf was nicely and delicious. I was very happy with my dish. \\n\\nMy friend ordered a burger and onion rings. But he got a burger and fries.

What's important is that this burger was a big departure from the traditional Mozza Burger. There was no mozza sauce, lettuce, tomato,  or bacon to speak of in this similarly-priced burger, so you'll want to keep note of the meat-source count if that's important to you. While this wasn't a bad burger, I think the name is a little misleading given what customers have been accustomed to when they order a traditional Mozza Burger. \\n\\nThe Onion Rings here were a little oilier than what I was accustomed to.

The carrot and raisin salad was fantastic. Shredded carrots, raisins, blue cheese and walnuts in a vinaigrette. The farmers salad was equally as delicious.

The seafood pizza wasn't as good as we remembered. My partner said it was very salty and it just didn't seem to shine like last time. The desserts were probably the best. The sorbet was very good and the spike root beer float was tasty. If we didn't use the Groupon, we'd probably pretty upset at spending $50 on that meal.

It was amazing, but I definitely could not finish it.  Each plate comes with home fries and toast, with a side of this amazing jelly/hot sauce I have only had at Brookline.  The coffee is nice and strong, and the service is quick and friendly.

The recipe has gone through many iterations, but I think they're getting close to where they want it. I also recommend the fried artichoke if you're with a group who wants to nibble on things. The artichoke is fried to a point where it's entirely crispy, and it's served with a decent aioli, which creates a very tasty ordeal.\\n\\nThere is a daily crostini which is featured on the special menu.

We wait and watch all the servers start from the big table to the right and end up bringing nothing on our side because it's done by that round!!! After half an hour we decided to let our server know that meat is coming a little late- he turns to the server talking in Portuguese ( foreign language). The server starts to explaining why he didn't bring food till now and then he goes to the next table to continue talking in Portuguese to tell them how we have complained !!! Wow- Wish they knew two things - 1. No one goes to rio and pays $31 to enjoy your shitty buffet , they are there to eat the meat if you didn't know so distributing it evenly would work well 2.  Other people who don't look like Brazilians may also know how to speak Portuguese.

My boyfriend & I witnessed every display of poor customer service in one sitting. We went to this location last night. When we pulled up the drive through line was wrapped around the building so, being a Saturday night we just assumed they were busy so we went inside to eat. At first I was displeased with the monotone, unfriendly vibe I got from the girl behind the counter when we ordered our food but after this horrible experience I ended up feeling bad for the girl because she was basically running the whole place by herself. We ordered or food at 8:54 PM & our fries were brought out after 5 minutes. They have one of those fancy pop machines with the 100 different flavors but none of the flavors were actually available & the pop tasted weird. 15 minutes passed and we were still waiting on our sandwiches. Meanwhile, there were 3 employees standing by the drive thru window not doing a single thing! One of the girls was staring off into space with her HANDS DOWN HER SHIRT, SCRATCHING HER BOOB! The kid who was making the sandwiches was moving at a snails pace & I watched it take him 5 minutes to make a small cheeseburger for the drive thru. Then he WIPED SWEAT OFF HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HAND & CONTINUED TO MAKE THE DRIVE THRU FOOD! (Luckily he did not make our food & i watched like a hawk while they made our food later) While this is all going on, a manager walks up to another employee & starts talking bad about a man in the drive thru who was upset because he got over charged for his food! IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS! Calling the guy crazy & this & that. Instead of doing his job as a manager & addressing the issue he continued to run his mouth about this man. At this point the line was wrapped around the building for both the drive thru & inside. 25 minutes had passed & we still did not get our sandwiches. The girl who took our order noticed and SHE had to say something to the MANAGER! He then rolled his eyes & gave nothing but attitude about having to do his job. No apology from him, just from the clerk. The 3 other employees were still standing back there doing absolutely nothing. When we FINALLY got our food & sat down to eat our fries were freezing cold, my chicken sandwich was extremely dry & unappetizing, my boyfriend's burger was not cooked through (lucky for them he likes a little pink in the middle but it's still not normal for Wendy's)  before we left my boyfriend went to the restroom & when he came back he looked extremely mad & grossed when I asked what was wrong he said the bathrooms were absolutely DISGUSTING. We left & went to the movies & when we drove back from the movies at 12:45 AM, the line for the drive thru was STILL wrapped around the building. I just am in shock & awe over what we experienced at this location. It is a very convenient location, being right by our house but now we don't know if we ever even want to go back to this store.

The hostess walked to a table that was in the middle of the room that seats 4. I asked if we could be seated at the table with the booth seat that also seated four. She stated they like to save that table for larger parties; it is the same size table, it was also set for four. I'm not sure what the real reason was, but it was definitely annoying.  We ordered the Crunchy Ringo Roll, the Blind Date roll, The lemongrass soup with shrimp and the shiitake mushroom miso soup. The lemongrass soup came out with chicken, rather than shrimp. The waitress was apologetic and took it back, only to return with another bowl of chicken soup.  She was appropriately mortified and offered yet a third bowl of soup which I politely declined.  We just asked for the check because it had taken so long for our food to come the first time we really didn't want to be there any longer.  She did end up bringing over a basic salad and a bowl of miso, complementary.  The food we had was delicious, and the waitress was doing her best given she was the only server and several other tables arrived while we were there.

I am not as much of a fan of the pesto chicken salad as I was of the previous chicken salad (which is available at Bloc 11, so no complaints).

The beer that i had was amazing though. It was an amazing sour beer called the devil because of the 6.66 alcohol content. They also had many types of pumpkin beer which i thought was pretty original. Another aspect that i really loved about the place was that most if not all of their food is sourced locally which is always a plus.

The lousy acoustics in the small restaurant make it so that even when the restaurant is not full, the sound level is extremely loud. The wait staff, while not rude, are just plain terrible.

When he delivered the food, he mis-identified the items he was delivering, and made us wait 10 minutes after the food was delivered to get any rice. This was as we watched other servers go by with bowls of rice to be delivered to tables *with* their entrees. After the rice was finally delivered, we didn't see our waiter again. Period. The hostess ended up delivering our check after we were done with the meal. It would have been nice if the server asked how our food was, because one of my friends got food that was so spicy she couldn't eat it (even though the item, chicken tikka masala, was not indicated as being spicy on the menu). My item, on the other hand, I explicitly ordered as medium spicy, and it came out mild.\\n\\nTo summarize, the food is decent, the atmosphere is bad, the service is atrocious, and I think the only reason this place is so busy is because it's the only sit-down Indian restaurant in the area."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It's not fancy.

Based on better info., I understand that the Old Town location has completely different ramens thanks SE.  And that the restaurant is more of an experimental ramen bar and less an itzikaya bar.  I've now upped the review to 4 stars.  I still believe they have some kinks to work out in the new store, but I intend to continue to support what is arguably the best of the ramen joints in town.  I will say that if you want traditional ramen, def go to the SE location.\\n\\nOld review: I was totally stoked to see Afuri open their second store near Old Town/SW.  The interior is open and lovely with long community tables.  The menu is more limited than the SE store, yet it still includes the wonderful ramens, gyotza and other plates along with popular drinks (try the house made ginger ale).  \\n\\nSo why three stars? I've never complained about portion size - ever.  I leave that nonsense to the unhealthy amongst us.  But in the case of Afuri on SW3rd I must make an exception. \\n\\nOn a recent visit, I ordered my fave shoyu ramen with all the fixins including, of course, pork belly chasyu.  Normally I expect several, slices of reasonably robust pork belly.  In this visit, I got three small slices that were maybe half as thick as normal.  If it totaled an ounce, I'd be very surprised. \\n\\nWhy would Afuri short customers in a new store?  It just doesn't make sense.

I can't even rate the food because we were so repulsed we got up and left after speaking to a manager.\\n\\nMy wife and I live in Oviedo and we thought since she's never been to Celebration that we would take the drive to check out the town. After checking out the farmer's market we started searching for a place to eat a late lunch and happened upon the Market Street Cafe. It was about 2:30 pm so the restaurant wasn't terribly busy but nevertheless we had to wait awhile before we were seated because the hostess said they had to clean a table. Finally we were shown a booth and while the table was indeed clean, the seats had food on them - both sides. In front of the hostess, my wife cleaned her seat while I sat down. I then looked closer at my seat and noticed it was covered in salt, food crumbs, and I was actually sitting on a piece of lettuce. I got up and sat with my wife with the hope that I could get one of the wait staff to clean the seat. We waited. And waited some more. We observed the reason why there was food on our seats. There was someone cleaning the tables but instead of wiping the food into a container he was simply wiping it off the table on to the floor and seats - neglecting to wipe the seats as well. Looking closely we both observed that the floors were caked with food crumbs. This was the beginning of our feeling repulsed by this place. In the process of waiting we could see 4 wait staff in the corner chatting with each other. Finally our hostess went over and said something to them while pointing in our direction. A waiter came over and took our drink order and after I asked, cleaned the seat. While waiting for our drink order to come I got up to use the men's room. Before leaving I tried one soap dispenser. It was empty. Then I tried another and when I tried to turn on the hot water to wash my hands I discovered that the faucet was broken. I then tried another faucet and after waiting a couple of minutes for hot water none came out. This after observing an employee use the bathroom and wash his hands in the same sink. In other words, employees were washing their hands without the benefit of hot water. At this point I was seriously considering leaving the restaurant, but decided to withhold my reservations from my wife in favor of trying to enjoy our lunch together. When I returned to my seat my wife told me that she observed our waiter in the corner eating food with his fingers and then bringing our drinks to the table without washing his hands first. I didn't say anything and instead, took the wrapper off the straw and put it in my drink to take a sip. It was at that moment that I saw what looked like cake frosting on the rim of the glass. Since it was a plastic cup I thought maybe that the plastic was discolored so I wiped it with my finger and it indeed was food on my glass. At this point we had enough. I flagged down a wait staff and asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and we recounted our experience up to this point. She apologized but seemed more focused on hot water in the men's bathroom than anything else we said. The apology was delivered half-heartedly so we both got up and bid our farewell. I'm writing review a day later but I still feel as disgusted this morning as I felt yesterday. To say I'm repulsed is an understatement. NEVER AGAIN!!\\n\\nOh, my wife reminded me to mention the condition of the outdoor seating. When we arrived we noticed that many of the tables had not been cleaned. This factored in our decision to eat indoors despite the gorgeous outside weather. After we left and dined elsewhere we happened to walk by the Market Street Cafe on our way back to the car and noticed that more than half the outside tables had still not been cleaned. In fact, there was a bin full of dirty dishes sitting on one table and no employee to be seen anywhere.

Some of the staff are pros from the other stores so despite the recent opening they seemed to be on top of things.\\n\\nAt this location I have had the Peachy Green and the Tiger Lily. The Peachy Green was nice and cold that I decided to enjoy it on the patio. It is filled with spinach, kale, apple and chunks of frozen peaches. I added ginger to the Tiger Lily to give it a kick. The Tiger Lily has cucumber, celery, kale, spinach, parsley and wheatgrass. Super healthy and easier to drink than some other \\"green\\" juices. I plan to order the mango habanero aqua fresca the next time I stop in.\\n\\nThey have a cooler with vegan and/or raw items.  I love the flavor of the Feast In the Middle East (flax oil, hummus, quinoa tabouli) and they go great with black bean Beanitos.\\n\\nThe quality of the juices are spot on, most of the veggies are organic and some of the fruits are organic. My only beef is if you add ingredients a juice could easily rack up in price."},{"name":"Papa Gino's Pizzeria","address":"1018 Lexington St.","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"Just decided to place an order (after a 6 month break from them after a last disastrous order) because I got a flyer in the mail with some crazy deals on it.

The pasta was over cooked and mushy on BOTH dishes. The meatballs were formless undercooked meat chunks that tasted a bit old.

We ordered the scallion pancakes which had enough crispiness and the tom yum soup with shrimp which had plenty of shrimp pieces and plenty of flavor. I ordered the eggplant with tofu, one friend ordered pad thai with shrimp and another friend the seafood salad. Side note, each plate came with some beautiful, ornate radish garnish piece which I seriously thought about taking home because they were all different and looked like they took some time and serious knife skillls to carve. We were all pleased with the seasoning and spices-perhaps up there as being some of the best Thai we have had so far. For dessert, we got the fried banana and fried ice cream. I loved the crispy outside of the fried banana and there was plenty of fried iced cream to share among 3 people. \\n\\nThe decor is also absolutely beautiful.

Yes its small but it seems to be full of space. There is plenty of seating and yet it is intimate. Maybe not for a big group but if you are lucky and get the big table then yes for your big group. I dont think a date date but a lunch date place for sure. The food is all on display. You choose what you want and if need be it is heated up and brought to your table. Very speedy service and and friendly. Alwasys seems to be something happening back there. As it should be because the place is usually busy but it is not always full. How can that be you say? \\nWell the star of the show are the desserts and the bread. Most of which is either pre ordered or selected and taken out of the place. I have yet to really have a bad dessert. I think there is something there for everyone. Mostly bread centric but also not. I suggest you select a couple and split them with your friend so you each get a taste. Its the only way to make sure you havent missed something that delights the tastebuds. The breads are well something outstanding. They seem to have the ability to make a wholesome bread without all the air typically found in the Portland area. A crust a real crust that is crunchy and soft. A full bodied bread inside that could hold your topping of choice without dripping through the air holes. A real slice of bread in the European tradition. \\nIts intimate its perfect to meet a friend and have a great meal and feel as though you are the only ones in the restaurant. The meals are very good and very creative. Everything is freshly made and the menu seems to change as the seasons and the availablity change. There are some standing favorites that are always there. They make the best Croque Monseiur IMHO. Seem to be the only ones that get the cheese mixture correct. Melty but not too much a little poignancy but not over powering enough of a sauce to let you know its there but not enough to dominate the taste. \\nSo, you may be asking why not the coveted 5th star? Well as others have stated in their reviews the prices are just a little over expensive. When I say this I mean the portions are small well smaller than most restaurants and yet the prices are the same if not more. I would put their prices at even a dollar or two more than what they should be. Of course, I dont know the economics and I can say if it is because of the staff then the investment is there. All the employees seem happy and they are dancing in the background in a sort of production waltz always choreographed and always prouducing something wonderful for you to enjoy. I cant see you eating here every day. Maybe not even once a month. However, every so often its great to see how the other half eats.

It was unfortunately a stark comparison to the high quality, top notch service you experience w/in Disney property as it clearly showed Disney Corporation had 'left the building.' \\n\\nCelebration is in need of a fresh coat of paint and power wash and the service here at this location was either slammed by the holidays or just not totally invested.

Like, hard-packed, carelessly. By the time I got back to the office, it was all in a soupy, gross mess of pieces -- broken apart and swimming in juice. This seems to be the MO.

You don't come here looking for anything fancy or particularly impressive; you come here because it is simple and delicious.\\n\\nTheir brunch is popular.  I showed up once with the fam and once on my lonesome.  With the fam I ordered some sandwich.  Obviously it was not memorable.  On my own, I ordered *the* sandwich.  Now I could never eat this on a regular basis.  I would explode to the size of a whale shark (but they're super cool, so maybe that's fine).  However, it was worth the splurge.  If there is a special that involves a roll, two over easy eggs, swiss, avocado, and homemade hot sauce just trust me and order it.  Yeahhhhhhh it was amazing.  The oven potatoes on the side were fantastic.  The coffee was delicious but I did find myself wishing I had ordered one of the many mimosas on offer.\\n\\nI tend to go for dinner.  There is a special about every night of the week ranging from wings to pitchers to scorpion bowls to $5 burgers (Tuesdays).  These monstrosities are unfortunately delicious considering how close I live.  The marathon burger with avocado and sprouts is my favorite loaded with hot sauce.  If you can't decide between fries and onion rings, these guys won't make you.  50/50 is an acceptable answer.  I have also gone the healthy route and ordered a salad.  It was delicious and required zero effort on my part, so I can't really complain.  Prices are fair on non-special night, hovering around $10 for each item.  On special nights they are an absurd value.\\n\\nThe staff is also great.  They never flinch when I want a table instead of the bar, have a perfect sense of chat with/leave alone when I am at the bar, and are quick to tend to anything.  They also handle everything incredibly well.  Being near Fenway, I have over heard some absurd things (my favorite was when someone complained that the singular omelette the ordered for two had too much toast. the waitress agreed it was a lot and finally just said \\"here, now it's less\\" as she took some away after the complaining continued for an absurd amount of time; they thanked her).\\n\\nSo while I may say that Thorntons is not a destination location, I think that is what I like it most.

The server will take our orders and some other person will be running it out to us. A different person for drinks, a different person for appetizers, a different person for our meals. I don't know if this is normal but it's a pain in the ass. I can't find my server for anything because they don't bring me anything, and when I ask the person who brings me something, most of the time I can tell they sure as hell don't want to bring it to me. Or they drop something off and run away so fast I can't ask anyways.

The server stopped by right after I had cut into the eggs (which were overcooked) to ask how everything was, but left before we could answer. When the food runner came back with my boyfriend's pancake, I asked him if he could reorder my eggs, because the yolks were hard. The server came back five minutes later, after my boyfriend was almost done with his breakfast, and asked me where my plate was. When I told her, her demeanor turned very warm and she apologized profusely and went to check the kitchen for my reorder. It came back almost immediately and was cooked perfectly.

The first thing to come out was some Irish nachos, we had to ask for napkins and silverware, out of the 6 of us nobody cares for the nachos...so we moved on to the pizzas, they gave us 3 individuals to substitute for a large. The pizza was alright...I noticed at one point, someone who I thought looked like the manager standing at a table with what appeared to be his girlfriend hugging on him and he was eating food off their table.

I was a server for over 10 years and have managed bars and I would have done so many things differently; inform the manager so they could talk with the table, apologize for being out of items, just be more attentive if you can tell someone isn't happy.

It came with cooked salmon, chicken, veggie and shrimp tempura, nigiri and sushi rolls, potato salad, regular salad and miso soup. \\n\\nI only took one star off because of the service. While it wasn't terrible - it could have been better. We waited a long time for things like the check, wine, our order to be taken. Also, my meal came with miso soup and a salad which I was very eagerly awaiting because I was starving, but they did not arrive! When the entrees finally arrived I inquired about my soup/salad and the server told me I was wrong , that my meal didn't come with soup/salad. When my boyfriend reiterated that the menu said my meal did indeed include soup/salad, she said she would check and two seconds later came back with my soup/salad and no apology. Oh well the miso soup was pretty standard and the salad while mostly lettuce does come with some really good ginger dressing - and I'm not usually a fan of ginger dressing. \\n\\nDespite the less than perfect service, I can say that all the employees we encountered were very friendly. \\n\\nOverall, I definitely recommend it. Fresh fish, huge selection of cooked entrees, sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi and no need to dress up or wait an hour to be seated!"},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"2860 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 1630","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"My son and I came in to watch the Atlanta United game it started off with poor service.15 minutes to get service once we were seated another10 minutes to change the t.v.

This has become one of my favorite spots to hang out as of lately.  Hell I even choose it as location for a first date a few weeks ago. \\n\\nI do most of my partying at lounges and clubs during the weekdays (its cheaper and more relaxed that way), and usually its free to get in this place with free parking.

(Some folks bomb...but hey it's free entertainment)\\n    But that's not the only thing on a Wed.  From 7pm -9pm the Class Act Steppers are there teaching beginners ballroom Chicago stepping (no partner required), then from 9pm till about 10:30pm there is mixed freestyle dancing along with a small beginners Line dancing instruction.  \\n\\nOn Thursdays it's Karaoke with the sassy D.J. known as Cha-Cha, and you can catch a little line dancing in there on this day too (along with regular dancing).

When I am alone I usually just belly up to the bar which I did.  I looked around for a place at the bar that wasn't dirty and took a seat.  That was no easy task because most of the bar was dirty.  It took the bartender about 5 min to even say hello and when I asked what was on tap she asked if I could see the taps? Are you serious? They were on the other end of the bar and no I couldn't see them.  Once she noticed I couldn't see them she reluctantly started to name the taps.  She asked me if I wanted the 16oz or 22oz and I said 22.  What came 7 minutes later...I kid you not...was a 16oz.  She quickly disappeared and I had to wait another 5 minutes to order my wings.  I ordered 10 hot and what I got was 10 mild.  There was no heat to them at all and they tasted like cheap butter.  I was too hungry to wait to get the right wings so I just ate them, paid and left.  I am a huge fan of Rooster's wings but this location is not the quality I am used to at other locations.  The staff seemed uninterested in working and I felt bad for the guy who sat a few seats down from me because he waited roughly 15 minutes before being greeted.  I was shocked he waited so long.

For me though, what I really like it the amount of spice you can have with a dish.  Noodle box is one of the few places in the lower mainland that I've been to, that when you ask for hot, it is hot.  Now, to be on the safe side, Noodle box has broken down the spice into about 8 levels.  When you start getting to levels 7 or 8, there is punch!  At the top level, they use Naga Bhut Jolokia peppers (aka Ghost peppers).  A ghost pepper has about 1 million scoville units (a unit for measuring spice).  A jalapeno has about 10000 scoville units.  So, it will be hot!  For me, I like the 2nd or 3rd hottest levels, as there's heat, but you can still taste a lot of the flavours too!\\n\\nMost dishes are around the $11.99 price point (and you thought I wasn't going to incorporate the square root of 143.7601 anywhere).  This may sound a bit high, but I've found I've always been able to get two meals out of one box.  Additionally, with the food being as customizable, fast, fresh and tasty, I find it's priced alright.\\n\\nIf you're on 4th ave and have a desire for some stir fry or curry in a hurry, I would definitely recommend you check out Noodle Box!"},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Kitchen","address":"462 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"3","text":"We used to love this place, now we hate it..

Thus, this is your chance.  I guarantee that within six months, they'll be booked solidly for weeks into the future at any given time, because this place makes the best damn sushi you'll ever have.  They fixed me an alligator roll that made me weak in the knees, and if you're willing to trust their sushi chefs, they have a couple of \\"chef's choice\\" dinner options that won't disappoint: they made me fatty tuna nigiri in which the tuna literally melted in my mouth.  I'd always heard that term thrown around, and never understood what the hell people were talking about using it to describe fish until I ate a piece of this.\\n\\nThese folks can be a bit pricey, depending on what you get, but if you're hellbent on eating on the cheap, it's entirely possible--they have lunch specials that are completely reasonable ($11 or so for 3 rolls off a list of 15 or 20, and it comes with miso soup), and they have combo dinner entres that run you $16 or so for a lot of food.  That compares favorably with Fugakyu or Oishii, and I maintain that it's better grub.  Some of their a la carte fare is expensive, but goddamn, will you ever be happy you splurged.  Seriously.  The alligator roll and dragon roll are your friends.  I can't vouch for anything else on the menu, though my dining companions spoke highly of the tempura, the miso soup, and one of the noodle dishes.  Hell, even their dessert fare is great: it's a small menu (mousse cake [of the chocolate or green tea variety] and creme brulee), but I was quite taken with all three--nothing overpoweringly sweet, and the green tea cake is a great finisher to a sushi meal.\\n\\nI love the atmosphere in this place--it's a very small restaurant (seats 20 or so), crammed in between a laundromat and a dentist's office on Harvard Street, but they've decorated very well, and the ambiance is nice.  The soundtrack is a little weird, but I think that's pretty much de rigeur for a fusion place.  Since they're so new, they're still working out a few kinks: the sushi chefs can take a little while to get your food out to you (but you get to watch them make it, since the sushi bar is in the middle of the restaurant), but the waitstaff is attentive and helpful, and their bathroom is awesome.  (Is that a legitimate accolade?  I don't know.  I was impressed.)\\n\\nSo, summarily: you should eat here.  The place opened five days ago, and my roommates and I have been there three times.  It's a spectacular place, which is still under the radar, and if you find yourself out by Coolidge Corner, it's about the best you'll do for dinner."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"2700 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"The food is good, but the service is absolutely the worst. 4 different groups consisting of 9 people waited almost 10 minutes standing by the wait to be seated sign before anyone would even acknowledge that we were waiting to be seated.

In particular, we tried the dark charcoal broth and shio broth ramens for around $12 each. The decoration both inside and out was pretty cool, with lots of dark wood that gave a contrasted small Japanese shop compared to the neighboring restaurants.\\n\\nThe dark charcoal broth (miso) ramen was indeed unique, with a dark coloured presentation that had a feel of smokiness. Reminded me of the garlic oil / squid ink ramen in Toronto. A little creamy? The overall taste of the broth was ok, a little on the salty side. The shio ramen was also a little on the salty side at first, but after a few spoons, felt more salty, and was halfway towards being almost inedible. Typically I love shio's light saltiness, but this was too much.\\n\\nThe noodles were standard, the egg was also standard half-cooked, and the pork meat was thin and small. Basically finished it by the time I was halfway through the noodle. The only good thing about the bowl was the thick and juicy bamboo shoots.

Eggs/pancakes/french toast/and crepes (if you want to get exotic).  Not mind blowing.

I had their margherita as well as the double pepperoni. Both were very salty, but especially the pepperoni (which should be hard to mess up). The crust was decent, but the cheese wasn't quite right. It just sat like a blob on top of the crust, instead of melting into cheesy pools like it should. If you want better Neapolitan pizza, check out Antico in Home Park or Ribalta in Midtown instead. We also ordered an Italian cream soda and a housemixed lemonade. They were okay but not worth the money. There's lots of seating, and it was reasonably quiet when we went for dinner.

I had a margarita in a mason jar, and as another patron observed, drinking anything out of a mason jar makes it better, so they've got that going for them. Good pour and not too sweet. I had a ginger beer today which was not my favorite. Other friends like the tea and the beer seems to be ok. Almost got a pbr, but if it's not ice cold it's undrinkable, so I didn't want to take the chance!\\nWhen we went for dinner, my friend and I both had brisket. It's a big slab of meat. I like getting BBQ with the sauce on it---I never got dry BBQ before, certainly not in TX or cali places. Their sauce is mild, tomato based---good not great. The vinegar sauce is pretty good, but again, I've had better. And the hot hot is like a mexican habanero  hot sauce, just a few drops'll do you. Sides: biscuits are amazing, but fill you up fast. A good meal would be a biscuit and the greens and no meat! Greens are pretty good, with a  nice liquor, but salty. Mac and cheese is greasy with soggy bread crumbs. Cole slaw is like chunks of cabbage with a watery dressing that is not sweet enough. The pulled pork again felt like it should be served sauced. It's also very salty. It's good, but I've definitely had better, many times. The ribs were good. Still waiting to have the chicken. we did not do desserts. \\nIt's a homey feeling place, but quite loud and we were seated at a communal table, which was probably a drag for the two people who weren't in our silly loud party. Service was excellent, fast, informative, friendly without being up in our business. I think it's a little too trendy, spendy and maybe kind of a slightly, \\"oh, aren't we cool, we're into SOUTHERN STUFF\\" vibe. Self-conscious and not authentic.

We came back here for dinner last Friday night, and I must say, it was completely night-and-day from the prior experience. My husband and I walked out in agreement that this will be our go-to place in the neighborhood moving forward.\\n\\nWe were immediately greeted with smiling faces when we walked through the door- I've never come across such genuinely happy hostesses.\\n\\nOur server, Christin (sp?) was PHENOMENAL. She was extremely friendly, attentive, and had the best recommendations. The gentleman who was working along side her filling up waters was on his game as well. If you get seated in Christin's section, you're going to have a great time.\\n\\nWe started off with the popovers, which were delectable- like an upgrade to a croissant with a melt-in-your-mouth texture to it.\\n\\nPer Christin's recommendation, we got the tuna tartare appetizer- I'm not joking, this might be  the best tuna tartare I've ever had in my life- I'm not exaggerating. Get the tuna tartare, you won't regret it.\\n\\nFor our main entrees, I got the 101 double stack burger, and my husband got the bone-in ribeye (per Christin's recommendation as well). I'm confident in saying that this was the best burger that I've had in a while, and my husband was on CLOUD 9 with his Ribeye. He was raving about it the rest of the night.\\n\\nBecause we're both gluttons, we HAD to get dessert. I decided to try the cheesecake because it was made in-house, and my husband got the seasonal sorbet, which was mango, which again, Christin recommended. The mango sorbet legitimately tasted like mango in ice cream form- we probably could've downed a tub of this stuff on the spot. The cheesecake was delicious as well, but for those of you that might be used to a more dense cheesecake, this one has a more whipped quality to it. \\n\\nWhile we were finishing up with dinner, David, the general manager, stopped by to see how we were enjoying our meal- he was extremely congenial and genuinely sought our feedback and the feedback of the other diners that were there that night. \\n\\nWe both walked out with huge smiles on our faces-I hope this place keeps doing what it's doing, because I think this will be our go-to place for weekday cocktails/happy hour, and weekend dinner to celebrate special occasions and to indulge ourselves via some amazing food.

It's one of those \\"Only in Austin\\" kind of places.  The first time we had dinner there, we were on our first-ever visit to the Lone Star State.  I think it was in September, a UT Football weekend, and there were plenty of burnt-orange-clad peeps drinking margaritas out front.  I knew I had found the right place!\\n\\nThe food is about average for Austin Tex-Mex.  Definitely not in the class of Curra's or Maudie's in my book, but it's good enough.  For the money though, it's a great value.  You do get plenty to eat and it won't break the bank.   Their margaritas are downright yummy--not too sweet, right amount of booze...I never miss a chance to have one when we eat there.  Chips and salsa are tasty--thin, crispy chips and their salsa is smoky and fresh.  Yum.  Fajitas are good, enchiladas are good....you won't be blown away, but it's decent.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is so fun.  There are two open-air patio areas--one with TVs on a deck, and the other is a covered stone patio.  There is indoor seating too with TVs.  You can bring dogs to the stone patio.\\n\\nOne downside to the Ditch is the parking situation.  West 5th has changed 100% in the time we've been eating there, and the parking situation has gotten tight.  They do have space to park to the right of the restaurant on west 5th, and behind it.

They were set to meet us at the restaurant at around 6:30; my date and I got there at 6:00 after doing some shopping around Polaris.  We were seated rather quickly and put in our requests for drinks.  These came out pretty quick, and at this point it was probably around 6:05.  We didn't see our waiter again for at least 20 minutes, which was unfortunate was we wanted to put in an order for an appetizer.  The waiter finally came back around 6:30 and we placed an order for the calamari, along with ordering drinks for my sister and date as they were close.  The drinks came out quick, and the calamari shortly after they arrived. Sidenote: Calamari was awesome...hot and fresh, melt in your mouth tender. Again, it was about 20-25 minutes until the waiter came back to take our dinner orders.\\n\\nEventually we ordered.  I should mention that the table behind us (group of 6) and the table on the other side of us (group of 4) were seated right before we placed our dinner orders, and both tables received their food at least ten minutes before we received ours.  Now, what about the food?  \\n\\nMy sister ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, and it came out looking just like the menu photo.  She said it was delicious.  Her date ordered the Mediterranean chicken pitas and he said they were tasty as well.  My fiancee got the Jambalaya and she enjoyed it.  Probably worth mentioning that this was a huge portion size and she was happy to have the leftovers later in the evening.  I was trying to decide between the cherry chipotle salmon and the Hawaiian mahi mahi and ended up going with the mahi mahi.  I regretted this decision almost immediately.  While the veggies/rice that accompanied the fish were great (scarfed down with no regrets!), the fish itself was extremely bland.  There was no seasoning on it whatsoever, and definitely no glaze of any kind as the menu indicated.  It seemed to take forever after this to get our check, and we didn't end up getting out of there until a little after 8:00 PM.\\n\\nThe waiter we had was extremely polite and courteous; I feel as though he may have simply forgot about us a few times.

No peppers, no guac, no rice, no beans, none of the extras. Called up, the manager said they would remake my order if I came back. Okay, I drive back and ask to speak to the manager. I don't know who I spoke to, but the offer of remade food was NOT honored. I got sent home to cold chicken and cold tortillas, gee thanks. I did get rice and beans to eat with the chicken I had to reheat because no, they won't remake my order after all. The lesson is: Don't go back to let them fix your order, because they won't? Maybe don't go through the drive in, they won't get your order right. How about this: Save yourself the hassle and just don't go to Taco Cabana on Manchaca and Slaughter.

Nothing mind-blowing, but nothing awful, either. The sangria was delicious, though. I enjoyed the lobster croquettes, albondigas, and the patatas bravas. I like richer, spicer bravas sauces, but Tasca's milder sauce was still good and worked nicely with the aioli. The gambas a la plancha were simple, as was the grilled brie and Spanish tortilla. My least favorite plate that we tried was the filet. The meat was cooked to a perfect temperature, but there was so much sauce that it kind of drowned out the meat. I can't even remember some of the other items we tried, but nothing was horrible...especially when you factor in their reasonable prices. Menu offerings and vibe aside, one of the most Spanish things about Tasca was their realistic tapas prices.\\n\\nOverall, Tasca is definitely worth checking out. It's great spot for sharing a sampling of a wide variety of tapas at a fair price...all in a welcoming atmosphere. My only real complaint is that I wish they'd serve or offer pan con tomate as a stand-alone plate.

Thankfully a ramp with a swirling highway below keeps me from walking to the other side of Lavista where there is even more temptation.\\n\\nAfter a three hour bus trip for work I arrive in Tucker. Once I get here I am very hungry. If I fail to bring a small breakfast I usually end up getting something from Waffle House or Ihop. The Ihop around here is good but too expensive and I am tired of spending ten bucks on breakfast, the Waffle House has roaches so I eventually had to try Old Hickory House.\\n\\nI've heard some people call this place the Hick House because it is full of red necks, with the black folk in the kitchen. I wondered if I would walk in there and someone would say \\" Dese are white only pies \\" but when I came in yesterday the staff were very friendly and she waited patiently as I browsed over the menu to see what I wanted. I eventually decided to get the bacon breakfast which consisted of two huge biscuits, three pieces of crispy bacon, a small bowl of grits and scrambled eggs and cheese. I paid about 7 bucks for everything.\\n\\nThe biscuits were probably the best biscuits I have ever tasted. Don't second guess yourself on the biscuit, just get it. It is light and fluffy and big and you just have to get one!  Unfortunately they don't offer anything like homemade jam or apple butter.\\n\\nThe grits tasted tasted over cooked and I don't know what type of butter they put in it but it left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\nThe bacon was delicious. Very crispy, but not burnt.\\n\\nThe scrambled eggs did not taste like real egg. It tasted like egg substitute but they say they use real eggs so I didn't understand. Maybe its that cheap butter again. Or bad cheese.\\n\\nSo overall I was delighted about the biscuits mostly and took my girlfriend there today to eat biscuits and she loved them. I will say that I tried their hashbrowns today and I was disgusted that there hash browns were fries chopped up with onions on top.

Some of the worst service ever.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago we went to Sweet Cheeks for dinner on a Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday (he had been craving some Q). We had a 9:15pm reservation. We arrived a bit early but they were able to seat us immediately because they didn't seem super busy. The birthday boy was very surprised when the menus (paper) came to the table and \\"Happy Birthday, Justin!\\" was stamped on them all. Everyone thought it was a nice touch and pretty sweet!\\n\\nWe were all starving and decided to order drinks as soon as possible. Our waitress took our order and proceeded to tell us that she and another waitress would be taking care of us. So far , so good. Then 15 minutes went by with zero contact from the waitstaff. Again, had it been busy we would have understood but it was pretty dead, there was plenty of waitstaff, and they knew we were there to celebrate. My husband could see our drinks sitting on the bar for at least 10 of the 15 minutes. And then our waitress finally went to get them at the bar...and proceeded to talk to another waitress as she took another SEVEN MINUTES to casually garnish them. You'd think these drinks each had a ton of garnish...they didn't. Again, having waitressed I would have totally understood had she gotten to the table and apologized but the woman didn't even acknowledge the wait. She tried to walk away from the table without taking our order and I loudly said, \\"WE'RE READY TO ORDER.\\"  Our drinks, by the way, Fenway Fizz for me (strong but awesome, not too sweet), brutal juice (which might have been our favorite), bbc steel rail, and the Federale (which was, unfortunately, too spicy for the birthday boy...though he refused to send it back which is totally on him).\\n\\nNow for the good stuff.  We've started with bucket o' biscuits - these things are huge and absolutely delicious and the honey butter they're served with is perfect. We all order our own meal but shared most of it. The fried chicken was very tasty, though the hot shake was pretty one dimensional - glad we got a side of the spicy honey to drizzle on lightly. Everything from the smoker was on point - Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chopped Brisket, Pork Ribs - all with the right amount of smoke, the right texture, and just simply delicious.  \\n\\nThe sides were a bit of a mixed bag. All of the cold sides were fantastic - farm stand salad is a nice change of pace from the usual bbq sides and both the coleslaw and the potato salad were fresh and bright. The mac-n-cheese, black eyed peas, and baked beans were all fine but not anything to write home about. \\n\\nWe again sat there for about 10 minutes when we were all done waiting to order dessert and have some stuff packet up. When the waitress finally came over and folks asked that things be wrapped up, I made sure to ask that they be put in different bags as they weren't headed to the same home. Our waitress, of course, brought one bag. \\n\\nAnyhoo - dessert - We ordered the Banana Mess and the Nutter Butter. Though a few of us found the Banana Mess a bit too sweet (the marshmallow sauce might have been overkill) it still hit the spot for the birthday boy. The HUGE Nutter Butter on the other hand could have used that marshmallow sauce - it was dry and there was zero flavor difference between the cookie and the (very minimal amount) of filling. I'd strongly suggest that they revisit that recipe to balance it out a little more.\\n\\nThe proteins, drinks, and biscuit get 5 stars. \\nThe sides, as they were a mixed but overall good bag, get 4 stars.\\nThe service, however, gets a 1 star. I have never had service so clueless as to how bag they were or how long they made us wait for everything. Beyond disappointed with this visit solely for the service. It was actually to the point that I'm really no longer interested in trying Tiger Mama as they have the same chef/owner.\\n\\nWe'll definitely return but ONLY for take out."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I think someone poured heavy whipping cream and clams into a food processor and let my clam chowder have it.

In college my girlfriends and I used to frequent this place and of course we would have, ok I would have, a little more sangria than necessary and hit on the waiters in the form or ridiculous banter and racy comment cards.

However, as the meal went on and the sangria kept magically disappearing, and awkwardness quickly disappeared.  I will spare you details as to why I ultimately felt I needed the break, but I did and took one for quite sometime.  I have since moved, though, and literally live right across the street. My parents had been there before and loved it so I recently revisited the place I had always loved but had no choice other than to excuse myself for a leave of absence.  But the return was uneventful, time has healed all wounds, and now I'm back as more of a regular.  Thankfully there was some major turnover...I haven't recognized any waitstaff there! (Sadly, though, they are now currently lacking in eye candy).  This is definately my first choice for family dinners when relatives are in town and both my immediate and extended family have all been impressed on numerous occassions.  It's also a great place to grab a drink and light snack after a movie or mid week and I think they are pretty reasonably priced.  You also have a lot of control over how much you spend here.  I'm usually fine with 2 tapas but order 3 and end up taking one home.  If you have a huge appetite, however, you'll end up spending some more....like my cousin who insists on ordering 5 every time we go out (he didn't finish this last time, though). \\n\\nP.S. if you used to work at Tasca, call me! ;) (see, that was sangria-free!)"},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Came around 7:30 on a Wednesday night, 20 minute wait for a table outside but worth it!

Unfortunately no, the tomato chutney is actually literally a chutney with apples and cinnamon, therefore making the whole sandwich taste like applesauce with spinach and mushrooms, totally nasty. I reordered the vegan truffle grilled cheese, with arugula and truffle oil, and when I bit into it I realized the problem with the sandwiches wasn't their toppings, but their vegan cheese. I asked what brand they used, as Daiya is very common at vegan food joints, and they told me they make their own soy based vegan cheese. If you've ever had Daiya you know that it's stringy, chewy, and salty, just like real cheese, but Toasted's vegan cheese is comparable to uncooked egg yolks. The texture is completely liquid and the flavor is barely there. \\n   \\n   Having been vegan for quite some time and trying many food substitutes, this is by far the worst substitute I've ever had. The worst part about all of this is that I spent ten dollars on a grilled cheese sandwich that I could have made better at home.

Not great for having a cheers before the meal. We ordered the Pork Chop and it came out rare (visible blood). The restaurant was understanding when we sent the dish back and cancelled it.

The inside is filled with velvet couches, large mirrors, and an overall \\"chic\\" feel of decor.\\n\\nNow as for the food... it was good.  The event had mostly appetizers in the form of pigs-in-a-blanket, mini-burgers, egg rolls,cheese, meats, and two types of pasta.  The first three were all pretty good, they did a decent job of making \\"elegant\\" such homey foods.  The cheese and meats left a bit to be desired.  The meats were dry and the types of cheeses they had were very basic and had probably been out for a bit.  The deserts were pretty good.  The chocolate covered strawberries were a little old.  The strawberries had the taste as if they had been made then chilled an evening or two before.\\n\\nThe DJ would probably have to be my least favorite part of the evening.  I realize he was to play TOP 40's but he had the tendency of throwing in songs that, although popular, I don't think were ever meant to be danced too.  I'm not sure if he was a house DJ, or just recommended by the establishment, but I wasn't a huge fan.\\n\\nOverall it was a nice locale to rent out for parties.

Motomachi was one of the first ramen shops established in what had become ramen central. This was my go to restaurant whenever I was craving ramen before the recent boom. Now, having eaten at most the new shops, I still think Motomachi is one of the best.\\n\\nThe noodles and organic chicken broth is always consistent. Plus their charcoal black miso ramen is a pretty original menu item. Though over the years, they have changed the way that they served their chashu and gyoza. On this visit, I was happy that they are grilling the chashu again. I only wish that they brought back their gyoza from years ago. It used to be much juicier than it is now and was an elongated shape that was not common which made me believe it was housemade. Their gyoza now tastes kinda generic.\\n\\nMotomachi has a steady flow of regular customers, but the lines are not crazy long like other popular ramen shops in Vancouver."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"A friend took me here for dinner and I was impressed with their food.

There's only 1 size to the charcoal ramen.  It's enough for me, but I would think most guys would need to have an appetizer or add-on.  The egg was perfectly done.
