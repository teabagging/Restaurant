However, the food was only mediocre. \\n\\nThis is not your typical dim sum restaurant. You will not find the oh so loud and hungry crowd of patrons that normally accompany your meal when you eat dim sum at restaurants such as China Pearl or Hei La Moon and you will not find Chinese ladies bustling carts full of steaming deliciousness all about an open dining area. If you are looking for a more subdued dim sum dining experience, first timers to dim sum, then this place would be a great first step before the \\"real deal.\\" \\n\\nYou will find a more tolerable noise volume here as opposed to the deafening noise level of a larger dim sum restaurant . NOT that there is anything wrong with loud crowds! I mean, loud is what I expect at a dim sum restaurant even on a Monday. If it wasn't then I would have reason to be concerned. \\n\\nSo, I found myself in a small, petite I dare say, restaurant with a capacity of approximately six or maybe even seven tables. And although we be a party of three on a Monday morning, dad, myself, and the boyfriend, we found ourselves sharing a table. Pleasant company none the less. \\n\\nWe were given a pictorial menu, accompanied by two checklists for ordering, and also given a more extensive lunch menu. Put a check mark here next to this, oh no wait, wrong! Put numbers instead, 1 for 1 order and 2 for 2 orders. I think we ordered like 14 dishes in total. Done. Handed our checklists to the waiter and waited for our food to be brought out. \\n\\nI was waiting to be impressed. I expected to see the food piping hot with steams evaporating before my eyes and all of the goodness that ought be coming from food served straight from the kitchen. But no, there was no steam coming from the food. Felt like my food traveled a long distance or there be a space in time before it landed on my table. \\n\\nI mean, I had a very positive dining experience. We were greeted and seated right away. The menu and checklists were easy to read and to order from. The waiters were sufficient in providing us with our tea, taking our orders, and bringing our dishes and then clearing the finished items throughout the meal. We even sat with great company, polite conversations exchanged, the noise level was tolerable, the food good. *Sigh*\\n\\nI suppose if the food had wowed me then I would be writing a different review. My father hadn't eaten dim sum in a long time since he disliked driving into Chinatown so I wanted to treat him to dim sum today. But by the end of the meal, not even, more like after the first few dishes, I wished I had taken him across the street to China Pearl instead. It's hard to say comment on the food when I am constantly comparing it to what I would get at China Pearl. Every dish I had here, China Pearl makes it better (according to my taste of course). I am sad to say I might have disappointed the old man. :(\\n\\n*Edit* Even my father said the food was mediocre. *Sigh*"},{"name":"Ping","address":"102 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for some casual eats and a drink.  \\n\\nThe food here is supposed to mimic Asian street food and thus is an eclectic mix of skewers, buns, soups, and noodles.  I have personally had the duck leg in broth, the pork bun, the baby octopus skewers, the quail egg/bacon skewers,  the salted duck egg salad, and the toast with coconut spread on it.  I found everything to be very good.  The octopus skewers were tounge-numbingly spicy and the duck egg salad was SALTY and spicy (interesting flavor combo).  My favorite things were the quail egg skewers, the duck leg, and the pork bun.  The duck leg meat falls off the bone and it's presented in a rich broth with a tea egg--YUM.\\n\\nThe decor is casual/Asian/eclectic and is in a nice, bright space.  My servers have been very friendly, so no problems on that end.  The prices have been complained about by some but, in reality, are reasonable for interesting food of good quality.

Not sure if it's gone downhill or what, but I'll come back and hopefully bump up my review. Here's why I'm concerned, based on my last visit:\\n\\n- Weird service. Not the typical helpfulness. I walked up to the counter and at least three employees looked at me without a greeting or offer to help. Was just about to walk away, when I finally got some assistance, which was flat and minimal at best.\\n\\n- I asked how much of a certain ravioli would be good for 2 people as a side. She suggested 4 - 5 pieces each (this particular type was huge). That seemed a bit large, but I went ahead with it. When I opened my package at home, there were 13 pieces in there, which is not what she recommended nor what I thought I was getting. Considering the bill was over $13, I should have been aware. $13 for a side dish for two. I know ravioli is a labor of love to make, and I'm willing to pay for that. But, I was a little bummed to be over-portioned and therefore over-charged.\\n\\n- Also when I got the ravioli home, quite a few of them were broken. I know they're delicate, but still.\\n\\n- I got the applewood bacon and spinach ravioli. I could not taste (or see) the bacon at all. It seemed mostly like ricotta and spinach.

The lamb sausage taco was slightly spicy with a chopped tomatoes and onions. This was one of my favorites as the seasoning was just perfect. The fried chicken came in a different batter than the fish tacos, with more of a salty peppery kick. These tacos came with pickled spicy peppers that cut through the richness of the fried chicken.

Good hotdog. Great idea.  Great packaging. They almost have the right idea. BUT... $7 for just a hotdog is not worth it (no drink or chips) At all. The packaging is a square box which is great for to-go food, but for all dogs. It's not sustainable, yes they say they sort through the trash, but you can have the same brand with a reusable baskets and wax paper. There is something about wanting a hotdog that I expect a little \\"grit\\" if they are going for a sausagery I would have never got it if I didn't go in.

There were many highlights to take away, but overall I am very disappointed at the way in which my party was handled.  I brought in 14 people for a birthday celebration.  We asked for three separate checks, which led to the food being ordered and delivered in an inconsistent and inappropriate manner.  The server indicated that she could not put the food in together due to the three separate checks, so we did not all eat together.  The food runners approached the table yelling out dish items without seat numbers or ideas of who had ordered what.  The last check's meals came out one hour later than the first, which was disappointing.  Next, I asked the server to bring the cake out at 9:00pm, and at 9:40, the cake was brought out half melted as if it had sat under the heating lamps for too long.  The server did not acknowledge the fact that it was melted.  Not only did we dish out soupy ice cream cake to our guests, but we also held up guests that would have liked to have left the restaurant well before 9:30 (we had a toddler).  At the end of the night, I received the bill, tipped the waitress 20%, as I am in the restaurant business and do not want to jeopardize her income. However, I called the store manager the next day to deliver some of my concerns. I was told that I would receive a call later that afternoon after the manager looked into the matter, however I have not heard from him in over a week.

They gave us two (pushed together) tables but still had to put some chairs in a tight squeeze on the end, fine. Before the waitress (Carla) took our order, I asked for our end of the table, five of us, to be on our own tab because we were splitting a bottle of wine. She told us she couldn't do it now and to remind her at the end. The food was great! Although the waitress never came around to check on us. Eventually she came by to clear our plates and drop a $960(ish) bill on the table and walked away. She proceeded to sit and fold utensils and napkins and expected us to split the bill between the 23 of us sitting at divided tables? We eventually called her over and reminded her about the bill splitting and she made another two bills, one for us five and another for the remaining party only to disappear again. When some other groups asked for further splitting she told them that she couldn't split it any more. Long story short, figuring out the tab and getting her to split it more was like pulling teeth even though she got full gratuity already included. I just wish we weren't abandoned the way we were and treated with such a poor attitude just because we didn't want to figure out almost a thousand dollar bill between 23 people on two separate tables. Also, if you're bringing your own cake be aware there is a $2 charge per slice, everyone got a slice and extras were scattered along the tables. I would come back for a dinner for two and hope the waitress I get is in a better mood, but never again with a group.

I have had the wings and thighs and both were crispy outside yet juicy inside and not too greasy. \\nThe Chef's Special Sandwich had a nice amount of heat if you like spicy food, but it needed more of their \\"frim fram\\" sauce and/or slaw, as it was just a tad on the dry side. \\nThe Original is like your traditional Chick-Fil-A sandwich, but homemade and a tad more gourmet with the B & B pickles. \\nAs for the sides, I have tried the fries, mac and cheese, and the collard greens. Fries were hand-cut, skin-on and cooked perfectly. They were served with a delicious homemade ketchup. \\nI thought the mac and cheese was good, but to be fair, I am not a huge fan of macaroni and cheese so I am not the best one to pass judgement here. \\nThe collard greens were a little on the tough side, in an effort for full disclosure, I had them just before noon, so perhaps they simply needed to cook longer.

They were very fatty and also undercooked.  The meat wasn't pink, but they were soft and not even crispy.  The hot sauce was bland and tasted like it came from the dollar store.  They didn't even come with dipping sauce.   We went home disappointed and tried to cook the pizza, our oven couldn't save it either.  What a waste of 20 dollars.  I don't understand how someone can work at a food place and serve food that they know is terrible and undercooked.  They pizza was cooked until the cheese was partly melted and then covered in raw toppings that made it even worse.  Not sure how this place stays in business if this is what they call food.  Of note, while we were sitting there eating our food, two different people came in to pick up orders that they had called in, and were told that the order was \\"lost\\" or mixed up.  The clerk then gave those people the pizzas that were intended for other orders, so I can imagine how many people were also unsatisfied with their experience.  Never again."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is amazing!

All of the dishes are also served alongside a paper slip of quotes... Guess it's a good way to start your day with some grub and inspiration.

Our waiter was somewhat friendly. As he was taking our order at first we felt rushed, and he was not that enthusiastic with us. I am not saying the guy should be laughing with us and jumping around, but a little more hospitality would help make the customer feel a little more comfortable to be there. Anyways no big deal. We took our first order and the food was mediocre.... I do not expect anything crazy from a buffet anyways to be honest. Beef teriyaki didn't taste like your average beef yaki, but more bland. My chicken pad thai was filled with strings of red onion and carrots other than the actual noodles, and maybe a few pieces of chicken. The calamari were very small, typical frozen pieces and were cooked to crisp...too crisp. I had a couple other things but I won't continue with those. Although I did have the sushi and I can say I enjoyed that the most. The sushi actually tasted the the typical sushi so it made you feel like you're finally getting your moneys worth. By the way, when your waiter takes your order, order enough because you probably won't see him for awhile. Technique I'm sure they use so people can get full  quicker. And don't worry about asking for the bill...the server will get you it before you know it. Stopping you early, whether you ate a lot or not...but mostly if you're eating \\"a lot\\", obviously. Look, the concept of a buffet is great but if you're going to run a buffet, do it right. Consumers want to eat as much as they want when they want at a buffet. Long wait and the feeling of being rushed at the end to pay is the last thing you should deal with...at a buffet. Thats why I think a server serving at a buffet concept plays a big factor in the buffet experience. If you're going to have servers, then there should be a new system created. I'm in the business and being honest about this review. I respect the work behind the scenes but this really should be done right."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Deeeeeelicious...........

On 6/19/15 at 3:02 pm my husband visited this restaurant to grab some to-go meals. The total for his meals was $85.32. The Bartender charged him, the original $85.32, and additional $85.32, $75.80, $81.94. These additional charges locked the MasterCard and a fraud alert was sent to us this afternoon. When we called the restaurant (after we call the credit card company), when I spoke to the manager he stated that he could not take my word for it and I need to talk to the bartender that made all the additional charges to the card. This should give you an idea how important your card security is at this restaurant.  I informed him that MasterCard was reversing the charges and this was a courtesy call. He wanted me to drive 30 min into the city to give them the original copy of the bill. I had a restaurant overcharge a card before and never had this much of a problem.  My husband took the phone and talk to the bartender, when he asked to speak to the manager again, this time a lady answered the phone.

I am not a vegan but I have friends who are and they would never take toppings from a container next to bacon. I was also a little taken aback at the crushed oreos and m&m's. Why use the big name full of GMO product when you could say chocolate sandwich cookie and chocolate drops. Ingredients listed would also be really helpful for those who are more then gluten intolerant. I found the entire experience underwhelming. I was hopeful that my kid would be able to delight in froyo but it was a swing and a miss. I was told that is the near future the dairy flavors will be corn free. Maybe we will try again when that happens."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"After several years of drooling over reviews of this restaurant, we finally made it for my birthday dinner.   \\n\\nATMOSPHERE:  Beast is located in a small storefront in an older building, nestled between Yakuza and Cocette restaurants.   Both are great places to grab drinks if you arrive early or the first seating is running late.  The latter happened last night, and Naomi came outside to encourage us to grab a drink and come back in 20 minutes, along with a promise to not start without us (something she kept to).   Entering you see two communal tables, black chalkboard walls with amusing quotes or recipes scrawled across them, and a small but highly efficient kitchen in one corner.   Generally  I'm not a fan of the open kitchen due to the noise and showmanship you often see.  In this case the restaurant exuded an almost zen calmness as all five staff members quietly went about their work with almost no conversation between them....one big advantage of the set menu for both patron and staff. As for the communal tables, ours was filled with numerous couples and all of us found space to be with each other, though as the dinner wound down we all engaged in a bit of friendly small talk.  \\n\\nSERVICE:   These guys are pros and really know how to make a patron feel welcome.  Every dish was presented with a description of both the food and wine.  My water glass never ran empty, and staff made us feel neither rushed nor ignored.  \\n\\nFOOD:  As others have discussed there is a set menu with no choices and no substitutions.  Some might find it annoying, like the vegetarian who sat across from me, but it's really the core of the restaurants operating philosophy so check out the menu ahead of time (posted every wednesday on their website).    The sequencing was good and my wife really enjoys her salad after the main course, such as occurs here.  All in all the quality was very high in regards to the ingredients, their cooking, and presentation.   Our pork turned out to be a little dry, but the remainder of the meal more than made up for it.  \\n\\nDRINK:  There is a beer and wine menu, but my recommendation is to go with the pairings.  Of the six we had, three were okay and three felt inspired.    You could order a single wine, or beer to go with the meal, but the courses are so diverse you might get some odd flavor combinations.  \\n\\nPRICE:  You're gonna pay for it.  This isn't a cheap meal, but we like to splurge now and then and we didn't feel overcharged for what we received over the yummy hours.\\n\\nADVICE:   Check this place out, but review their website beforehand so you know what you're getting yourself into.  =)"},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Tons of great beers to choose from.\\nI got one of the \\"boards\\" to eat, with sausages, cheeses, meats, bread, and all that kind of goodness, very pleased.  \\nThe service was fine, and the servers seemed knowledgeable about the beers they served.\\nLots of seating both inside and out.\\nI didn't try a pretzel but wish I would have.\\nThe sandwiches were huge and looked really tasty. \\nI'd come back if I was nearby but I wouldn't trek here for any special reason."},{"name":"Pho Hoa Noodle Soup","address":"1011 W 49th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"Stopped in to get some tea while waiting for my daughter's new ice skates to be assembled.

The waitress told us maybe it just wasn't their palette, which could be true but I told her that maybe the restaurant might appreciate customer feedback. In my background I would have told my manager and maybe seeing if they could do something about it. In the end, my friends ended up ordering a different drink and still tipping the waitress 20%.

It's kind of a strange setup since you don't walk in and sit down and be handed menus to order. You're directed up a side passage way to the register where you order, pay first, and get a number on a stick to take back to your table. On the way the menu is on the wall on the side above the passage, so in order to read it you have to pretty much block half the passage way, but luckily I was able to take my time since no one was behind me. Maybe I could have handed them a credit card to bill me after ordering since I was planning on getting some beers also, but nobody working there suggested that or much of anything so I sat down with my number. I'd ordered a Busco (or some Italian sounding) brisket sandwich with fries on daily special that was still the highest priced sandwich on the menu save for the \\"Big Floyd\\", so it seemed like a good choice. The brisket is shredded in a tomato BBQ sauce mixture and is advertised with fried onions for some reason since they're just sliced in there as usual with the brisket, and is basically the same as you'll find in the BBQ chains. The sandwich comes on a four or five inch torpedo type bun and isn't exactly brimming over with brisket so it was pretty underwhelming, but the fries were crisp and cooked correctly. Not too greasy or mushy. I did see some platters being brought out that looked more promising, so I'd suggest any of them on the menu over at least this particular brisket sandwich. As for the service, they do bring the food out but after that the staff sort of half waits on tables with no one in particular looking after yours. And since as mentioned no one went out of their way to suggest or really even say anything you have to figure out subtleties like getting up to ask for the BBQ sauce from behind the counter if you can't flag someone down. Floyd's does have craft beer on draft, so the afternoon's mirth and merriment was salvaged, but if they're going sell craft beer at craft beer prices they really ought to break down and pour pints instead of 12oz Ball glass jars. I may get back some day to try a platter, but maybe not. There's other BBQ around to explore."},{"name":"Buccieri's Pizzeria","address":"106 4th St","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"Tasty pizza in Boston's Chelsea neighborhood.

We were impressed immediately with the warm and tastefully appointed ambiance, and the graciousness of the hostesses at the front desk - I had made an online reservation, so there was no no wait - and the comfy cushioned chairs.  I don't see why others are crabbing about this place being overpriced - we found everything on the menu to be not only comparable in price to other favorites, but more interesting and well-prepared than any recent meals at Legal Seafoods.  The complimentary cornbread was served with soft butter - a nice way to start our meal on a snowy winter night.  I enjoyed a cup (small bowl, actually - $4.50) of the spicy Bermuda stew to start.  This is  a dish I've prepared at home and it was exactly as I expected it to be - thick, loaded with fish, and spicy.  Following that hearty appetizer, the crab cakes with cole slaw appetizer  ($12) was a sufficient entree for me.  My son started with a plate of PEI oysters ($2.25/apiece) - and then both he and my husband had the surf & turf  ($24) - a succulent, tender marinated skirt steak, about 8 ounces, served with Rock shrimp and french fries.  I tasted theirs and agreed that everything on the plate was flavorful, moist, and cooked to perfection.  We capped our meal with large mugs of rich dark coffee, and split two desserts - the pecan pie, loaded with pecans and not cloyingly sweet, and the ice cream sundae.

However, after our main course, a table across the restaurant with 3 girls started squealing about, guess what, ANOTHER cockroach under their table. After that the waiter came and told her manager who then proceeded to go outside and look behind the pillows and then close the doors. Didn't come over and apologize or anything.

I ordered the saag with lamb and some samosas. Finally, it was SPICY! Yay! Samosas were good!\\n\\nSo today, I went later on in the day. Instead of ordering their \\"lunch special\\" like before, I ordered a regular item on the menu that had to be cooked to order (I don't believe their lunch specials are cooked to order, that may be part of why I didn't like it before, and why it was so bland and spiceless). This time I was asked how spicy I wanted it. No, it still wasn't GREAT.... nothing to write home about... but definitely good! \\n\\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\\nI've tried all the Indian food carts downtown, including this one. Most of the experiences were either one or two star-ers...\\n\\nI just don't understand why these keep receiving such high scores.\\n\\nEvery time I order something, the main problem is that it's just NOT SPICY. Now, granted I like spicy (spicy-hot) food a lot, but that's not even what I'm referring to: I'm referring to the blend of numerous spices blended together to make that wonderful savory flavor that distinguishes Indian cuisine.\\n\\nOne might say \\"well it's just a food cart, do you really expect a bunch of gourmet spices?\\"  ---- to which I'd say: No, I wouldn't. But these are not \\"gourmet,\\" they're basic Indian, and it shouldn't be hard or expensive to accomplish, especially since the cooks in these carts are all (or appear to be) Indian themselves. They know better. It seems like even the really westernized brick-and-mortar restaurants do a much better job at flavoring the food than these carts.\\n\\nThe only saving grace is the price: HUGE amount of food for very little money. Maybe for some people, the value aspect is enough. But personally, I'd rather have a meal half the size that's properly made.\\n\\nI must come across here as a foodie-snob.

Building on what someone else here said, you definitely don't want to go there around noon, but that's to be expected downtown at lunch hour.\\n\\nMy beef with this location is the way they handle everything. Whether they're shouting across the room to get your order to get everyone's sandwiches started (just to have you repeat it a few moments later when you actually reach the counter) or messing up what actually goes on the sandwich, they can't seem to get things right. In the several months I've been going to this location, I have not *once* left with my correct order. Ever.\\n\\nHere are some of the more interesting foibles I've decided I will put up with in the name of cheap lunch fare: I always ask for everything but olives and cucumbers. I rarely if ever leave the store without olives on my sandwich. I will receive mayo or honey mustard nearly every time I request brown/spicy mustard. They toast my sandwich half the time when I say no (when they ask). (I order an item that normally comes toasted, and I think they only half pay attention when they ask.) The list goes on endlessly.\\n\\nThey get two stars instead of one though for one reason: they're actually really nice and apologetic when you point out their sandwich-making errors. I've never once had to ask them to remake a sandwich when they've messed it up beyond repair - they just do it instinctively.

With 18 kids it was a small fortune which was ok because, of course, I knew that going in. But this place didn't really get the birthday party / group experience. I would expect that they would get things rolling, literally! They quickly and politely got us shoes and then...well nothing!  I would have expected someone to help set up the lanes for the kids or come over and explain as time is a ticking and we were all anxious to get started, it was chaos!  I tried to set them up, one of the kids somewhat knew what to do and I was finally able to flag down the waitress to help us, very stressful.  Also I was informed when I got there that there would be no party favor bags that I ordered a month earlier as they had run out, nice! To be fair we had some last minute add-ons to our party but that didn't seem to be the issue, just didn't have them. Our waitress was nice the food was good and of course bowling is fun and bottom line my son came over in the middle and thanked me, which means he was having a good time and that is really all I care about. For some reason they didn't bring the ice cream out with the cake another discombobulation. And there was never a trophy for the birthday boy something that was part of the package I paid for and no explanation as to why he didn't receive it. If you are coming here for a party with kids I would recommend doing the cheaper option with only an hour and a half of bowling, they all seemed to lose focus after that so I wouldn't waste my $$$ on more time and you can order anything else you want to eat off the menu."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This is now my new favorite southern food spot.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a fast food restaurant, but we weren't up for waiting in line at the tourist destinations people rave about (since we waited earlier that day for brunch already). The decor inside is pretty fresh and clean with hints of green, I guess to match their name! There is a decent sized dining room with a good number of tables. Service was very friendly and attentive.\\n\\nI got a banh mi sandwich with crispy pork belly and my boyfriend got a noodle plate (vermicelli noodles) with pork. The sandwich was delicious and the bread was spot on. There was a lot of crunch going on with the pork belly and the crispy bread, but it was actually a fantastic combination. It felt like a modern take on traditional Vietnamese flavors and everything definitely tasted fresh. They even serve complimentary hot tea!

We ordered the family dinner, which advertised as coming with rolls, 2 sides, 2 handpies, and all four sauces. We ordered coleslaw & hashbrown potatoes as our sides, and the employee didn't even ask what sauces we wanted. At first, I was told that they didn't do hashbrown potatoes for the family dinner so I told them to switch it to mac & cheese instead. What we actually got was mac & cheese and a stick of hashbrowns. No sauces. No coleslaw. Not a single thing about our order was right. Luckily, the chicken was pretty decent, but definitely not all the hype that other reviewers have been talking about. I enjoyed the breading! The mac & cheese was completely bland and hardly cheesy. I didn't even taste the hashbrown potato stick they gave us because it was literally the size of a small granola bar so how can three people split that... the rolls were SO gross. They were rock hard! I was so disappointed, and I wish they had given us biscuits instead. The only sauce worth getting is the ranch - the others are kinda gross. \\n\\nThe best part of the meal? The hand pies. They didn't let us choose the flavor, so we were automatically given blueberry. The crust was flaky, buttery, and warm.

They have Virgil's cream soda (one of my favorites) amount others. Now to the food! \\n\\nI pretty much always get the Cuban sandwich from here because it's huge! Trust me, my friends always look at my tray and ask what I got and why I got so much (lol). It's really good and it's probably one of my top recommendations. \\n\\nThe sides is where I believe that this place really shines. All the sides I have tried from here have been great. I recommend the corn and Mac and cheese. Also the bacon wrapped jalape√±os are a must! They're not really spicy and they're delicious without being overly greasy. \\n\\nThey have this really amazing bakery on the inside near the back that is most probably my favorite part of coming here (and I'm not a sweets person). They cupcakes are all amazing, the peanut butter cup and birthday cake are my favorites! \\n\\nThey also make an amazing cupcake drop shake in which they mix a cupcake of your choice with vanilla or chocolate ice-cream. It's amazing and it will change your life. The shake is great, just imagine having little pieces of a delicious cupcake in a shake. I'm craving one as I write this review right now! I personally like the birthday cake cupcake with vanilla ice cream. \\n\\nOverall, if you haven't visited this place yet I suggest that you do! It's definitely worth the try and they even have a great bakery with tons of cupcakes and cakes."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What a wonderful mix of super hip vibe, very well stocked bar, and vegan dishes that excite the senses.

It turns out it has its ups and downs (like every place?) and is not the \\"greatest place in the universe\\" as so many people proclaim.  Of course I imagine that on a week to week basis or even on a seating to seating basis things may change.  So your mileage may vary.\\n\\nWe had second seating (8:45pm) and were the first to leave at 11:30pm.  Nice, leisurely meal.  I like this arrangement but it must be hell on the bottom line/business model for a restaurant. Service was very good, just nice, well informed/spoken servers who were glad to answer questions and were not overbearing in the least bit.  Kind of refreshing not to be upsold all night long or feel forced into small talk with a server.\\n\\nOf our 7 (?) courses (or was it 6?) they were all very unique and absolutely delicious EXCEPT for two of them... the salad was the most incredibly un-noteworthy I have ever had, I typically have the same or better at home every night.  This could be a function of season?  It was completely over dressing-ed (if that is even a word) and was so uterly lacking in anything to spruce it up - I mean, really, two pieces of goat cheese to try to set it off?  And then the ultimate disappointment was the dessert, bland as all get out... which is too bad because that is always the dish that really makes the evening despite all the deliciousness of the previous courses.  Like I said, all the other courses from the cheeses to the pate and everything in between was fantastic.\\n\\nThe only other major issue besides going 5/7 on the courses was they appear to have machinery like I dishwasher/sanitizer running very frequently.  Maybe you only notice it when you are sitting near it, but I found it incredibly annoying to have to raise my voice every 10-15 minutes for a long period to overcome it.  I would really recommend sitting away from it if you have a choice (which i don't think you do) or they should relocate it in back or outside or something.  It distracted the party of 4 I was in the entire 3 hours.  If you are going to go so high end on the food and price then have a place that is quiet.\\n\\nI eat at communal dining quite often so it certainly isn't an issue for me or anyone in our party.  However, if you are uncomfortable with it then don't go.  however, I noticed two people sitting at the butcher block bar/kitchen counter and the place was not full at our seating so if you don't want to rub elbows then that may be an option for you, however, you should call to inquire because I don't know the rules about it.  Of course since it is closer to the equipment it is probably noisier.\\n\\nSummary: in reality this place is probably a 4* however, after hearing so many people talk about how it is a 5* I really need to balance it out.  I recently ate at Robuchon (in Vegas even, not Tokyo, HK, or Paris) and that is 5* so I think people should really adjust their perceptions or not listen to the media/TV."},{"name":"Beijing Wok","address":"8106 Brodie Ln, Ste 109","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I loved the food here.

Also, the golden triangle appetizer, while not like usual Thai golden-whatevers-that-contain-chicken-and-are-served-w-chili-dipping-sauce in the sense that they're so simple, are awesome. You can eat about 20 of them and feel no remorse! Steamed veggie dumplings are delicious too, and again, no remorse. Those are only two of the great appetizers that NS offers. Food is A+. \\n\\nNow, onto the fun part. Noodle St 's menu is ridiculously convoluted, in the best way imaginable. The Engrish gracing the billions of awkwardly-hewn pages is more than enough to erase the effects of a bad day or a rough test. The dish names are ridiculous- everything is listed under a \\"street\\"- \\"Starter Street\\", \\"Fried Rice Street\\", etc and have many random additions of \\"XXX\\" or \\"Zzzzz\\" to the ends of the names, sometimes implying spiciness, sometimes not. All over the restaurant are lightboxes of silhouettes of little men (of pedestrian crossing sign fame) holding noodle bowls in various incantations- in a wheelchair, doing a headstand, lying down, and many others. It's insane, and I certainly wish I had them in my own home to provide me with endless amusement. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Noodle Street is a badass place. They have their own methodology and style that is worth experiencing many, many times.

The menu is designed to be shared \\"family style,\\" so we ordered a few appetizers and mains to share. The escargots and accompanying toast were light but flavorful. The Summerland Farm Salad is also a must-try. I especially enjoyed the gulf red snapper baked in parchment with a lovely lobster and caper sauce.\\n\\nService:\\nService was impeccable - helpful with suggestions but not at all overbearing, present and timely but unobtrusive. I was impressed. \\n\\nAmbiance:\\nThe restaurant is located below Bacchanalia and Star Provisions with access through a breezeway into between Star Provisions and Jeni's Ice Cream. The dining room itself has an intimate (almost speakeasy like) feel with dark woods and leather seating, though the lightning was a bit too dark and dimly lit for my tastes. The restaurant was half empty (in comparison to completely full JCT Kitchen and Cooks & Soldiers nearby), so I wonder if the location detracts from the crowds. \\n\\nPrice:\\nPricey but not terribly so (cough*Marcel*cough). Considering that the dishes are meant to be shared \\"family style\\" and not as singular entrees, the prices seemed fair.

Service was good."},{"name":"Cotters Restaurant","address":"200 W Nationwide Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"1.5","text":"My in-laws were in town from Florida and we were looking for a place to go before heading to the gallery hop in the Short North. Despite a bad review or two, we decided on Cotters because my husband had been there awhile ago with a good experience on a business lunch and we knew it would be easier to get a table there than some more popular places around town. What a mistake. It would have been worth the hour wait to go somewhere (ANYWHERE) else. \\n\\nFirst of all, the restaurant was nearly empty, there was ONE other table at 7:30 on a Saturday night...not a good sign. \\n\\nAfter we were seated, the incredibly awkward server took our drink orders and then brought them out one at a time, each a few minutes apart. He started by telling us there were four items on the menu that were not available. Please keep in mind, this is not a large menu. He told us about the lemon chicken special and explained to us that he and and the chef had to \\"throw it together last minute\\" because the original special was supposed to be ribeye but they were suddenly out of that too which is strange considering the place was empty. \\n\\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer and it was very good, although quite small. We then ordered our entrees: NY strip for me, filet for my husband and his mom and saltimbocca for her husband. We waited quite awhile and about the time we would have expected our entrees to arrive, a different server came to our table to deliver some news: the filets that my husband and MIL ordered were not available....HOWEVER the ribeyes (which we were the \\"sold out\\" special) would be offered to them at the same price as the filets. This other server told us it was a miscommunication. At this point I was mortified and having no other option, my husband and MIL agreed to the ribeye. So, to reiterate: we had waited a considerable amount of time hoping to get our entrees, were approached by some other random waiter, only to find out that at that point or orders hadn't even been submitted to the kitchen. \\n\\nOur meals arrived and I will say that mine was good. The steak and mashed potatoes were nothing to write home about but my steak was cooked to order and it was tender. I think my other family members enjoyed theirs although the saltimbocca was mostly uneaten so I wonder if our guests were just being polite and not complaining. \\n\\nI was still upset and totally embarrassed about the whole experience and was prepared to have a private conversation with a manager to discuss our service and the availability of the food. Thankfully, our original server came out and gave us two $25 gift cards which calmed me down a little. Before we even began eating, my husband's parents insisted on paying the bill so I offered them the gift cards which they turned down saying that we should use them another time. Then I went to use the restroom and after seeing the toilet tissue dispensers empty and the paper towel dispenser broken with a roll of towel sitting on the counter, it occurred to me that this place is probably on the verge of going under. With that feeling, it seemed clear that the gift cards we were given might not be of any use in in the future. \\n\\nAfter receiving our $178.00 bill, I was happy to have been able to convince my in-laws to use the gift cards toward the bill. With all the charming and delicious little restaurants around Columbus, I'm so sorry we took our family to this ridiculous place.

My name was called as soon as it hit the 45 minute wait mark. \\n\\nWe were seated at the bar. Not our favorite location, but we don't like to make a fuss. That is until I noticed what was happening on the other side of the 6 inch wall that separated us from the kitchen. Raw meat. Yes, raw meat was being cut into and stacked into bowls. Now, this may not be an issue for lots of people (especially meat lovers and Anthony Bourdain type people) however, although I like meat, I have an issue with seeing raw meat (or handling it for long) seeing the fat cut off and slices being thrown into bowls I was beginning to lose my appetite as I thought of the possibility of raw meat particles flying into my water cup. After sitting there for about 10-15 minutes I decided that I couldn't just power through it, so we asked the hostess if we could be moved down a few seats. (Thankfully there were some open!) \\n\\nShe was VERY friendly and understanding and asked if there was something wrong with the seat and I explained everything to her.

It's a catering company that expanded the front into a little eatery.  I attended a South American wine tasting at Tiny Bistro (also hosted by Hop City--see separate review) and got to sample some of Figs & Honey Catering's creations to go along with the wines.  Robert (chef/owner) came out and told us about each prepared dish and how it was going to complement each wine.  He put alot of research into the food that he prepared and also gave it subtle Italian and Spanish twists.\\n\\nI've never had this much food at a wine tasting before--we were actually stuffed when we left.  Our table of 4 shared plates of nuts & fruit, warm cheesy herb bread, bruschetta, thinly sliced churrascaria-style meats, and dessert.  The bruschetta was one of the best things I've put in my mouth.  It had arugula, prosciutto, ricotta, and the namesake fig and honey.  Lots of pleasing flavors and textures going on.  My second favorite was the huge plate of meat and smoked sausage with churrascaria sauce.  We couldn't believe the portion size.  Everything was really fresh.  I thought the meat was the last food pairing, but Robert came out with dessert as well!  They were these little ice cream sandwich cookies.  \\n\\nOverall a very pleasant evening talking with the staff of Tiny Bistro and of Hop City.

I've found the quality of their food to be pretty comparable to the other places in Chinatown, so definitely nothing too special, but will certainly be enough to satisfy any dim sum cravings! I have noticed the last time I was here that the skin used to wrap the dim sum is extremely thin and easily breakable - that's the only reason why I'm giving this review 3 instead of 4 stars.

This was the first time I've experienced the puffy tortilla.  I don't know if it's a Texas thing, but it was tasty.  My wife opted for the braised goat.

Before I comment on the food I did have, I would have liked a few more options on the menu.  As it was just myself for lunch and I do not eat much rice, noodles or fried stuff, I felt a little limited.   A small appetizer sashimi plate 7-10 pieces instead of 20+ would be a nice addition.  Another appetizer that would be great is a Tako Poke or Tako Su. I am also a fan of salmon skin and this was not on the menu at all. \\n\\nOK, so I ordered miso soup, Unagi nigiri and the Tuna Kobachi.   The miso soup was tasty with a good balance of tofu and nori but maybe a little heavy on the miso paste. I dont like my soup too heavy or cloudy.

But when our Serradura came and they were paying they complimented us on our choice of dishes.  They said it looked like we knew what to order and seemed jealous.  We said we really didn't know and just guessed at what sounded good.  I didn't have the heart to tell them that if they thought the chicken satay was \\"too spicy\\" they probably wouldn't have enjoyed what we ordered any better than their own meals.  I've never considered the Sam and myself being adventurous eaters, but I guess we are open to trying new things.\\n\\nThe Serradura is actually not that adventurous of a dish once you know what's in it, so don't be turned off by the American translation of the name: \\"sawdust pudding.\\"  I encourage you to order it and hope you will love it was much as I did!"},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Tried this place for the first time with some friends and I wasn't too impressed with their food. They are very over priced for what they serve you. Their R√∂sti I have got to say was horrible. It didn't even deserve to be called R√∂sti because it is supposed to be thin and crispy. This was a hash brown cake that was really mushy in the middle which did not taste good. The plate I ordered was the \\"benny\\" eggs Benedict. The main course was ok but for Benedict's and hash browns it was not worth the $15 dollars that it cost. The only really good thing about this place is their drinks.

One of the most inventive brunches I've had in a while. I loved the variety of their brunch menu, which included some favorites from their dinner menu. We came around 10:30 on a Saturday morning, and it was a 45 minute wait so we decided to drive to Lovejoy Bakery and kill some time. However, 20 minutes in, they called us and let us know a table was ready! Lesson learned- don't stray too far from Tasty n Sons, as we had to wait another 10 minutes for a table when we got back. We ordered:\\n\\n-Cup of Stumptown Coffee ($2): Definitely worth the cost, especially since you can pour yourself a cup while you're waiting for your table. Unlimited refills, and you can ask for soy milk for your creamer.\\n-Chocolate Potato Doughnut (w/Cr√®me Anglaise, $1.50/ea, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=dudsiZlyPutc4g3SKisoBw#dudsiZlyPutc4g3SKisoBw): Yum! You can't taste the potato aside from this doughnut's denseness, but the chocolate flavor was really good. Recommended!\\n-Griddled Bacon Wrapped Date (w/Maple Syrup & Almond, $2/ea, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=dudsiZlyPutc4g3SKisoBw#jFA5mUbsqTJeHWGRW6KQ-A): Eh, nothing special. The date was huge, but it was too sugary sweet for me. Skip!\\n-Polenta & Sausage Ragu (w/Mozzarella & Over Easy Egg, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=dudsiZlyPutc4g3SKisoBw#_TkWD5OjGpMsHhPwCImaTA): If you enjoy polenta, you'll like this dish. I'm not a huge fan of polenta, so I thought this dish was just ok. The polenta was nice and creamy, but I didn't like it combined with the sausage ragu (a bit on the salty side), and I thought the additions of mozzarella and egg were a bit strange. I wouldn't order this again but my two friends LOVED it.\\n-Fried Egg & Cheddar Biscuit (w/Fried Chicken, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=dudsiZlyPutc4g3SKisoBw#x2nUTGBj4iWlQTwaeGvYLA): We chose fried chicken for the biscuit, but you can also choose either smoked guanciale or sausage. This dish was super disappointing. The biscuit was dry, and it needed more sauce or something. The fried chicken was good, but not amazing. Skip!\\n-Burmese Red Pork Stew (w/Short Grain Rice & Eggs Two Ways, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=dudsiZlyPutc4g3SKisoBw#1lICIxEWXwzpnJl3lqF0uw): SUPER DELICIOUS, and a must order! This is one of their specialities, and it's amazing. The red pork was melt in your mouth tender, and the sauce was the perfect combination of salty sweet. I could've just eaten this and been happy. Next time I'm ordering my own bowl!\\n\\nThis was a lot of food for three girls and we were barely able to finish everything, but we were stuffed at the end. The total for everything was less than $40, which is a steal compared to prices in California! This space is pretty small, so it's highly recommended that you come early for brunch, otherwise you'll be waiting for a while. Parking in this area was tough, but there was street parking available a couple blocks away. However, the difficult parking and wait time was worth it- don't miss out on eating here!

My girlfriend got the pastrami sandwich, which has kraut and swiss on rye bread. Really great as well. Thick cut pastrami that was well seasoned. Capped everything off with a cappuccino.

We went on a random Wednesday at 6 pm- not crowded and the service was good. As we left, the place started to fill up. I think those of you writing bad reviews of this place must have either gotten the wrong item on the menu or dined at a very crowded time. \\n\\nAll five of us at our table LOVED our dishes. We ordered the burrata to start...I don't know of any places in this city that have this amazing cheese on their menu. Try it! You will not regret it! When a restaurant has burrata on the menu, that is how you know you are at a true authentic Italian restaurant. Having been to Little Italy in Providence, RI and New York City, this place comes closest to those authentic Italian restaurants. Atlanta is not known for its Italian culture like northern cities are, so to see a place in this city cooking amazing authentic Italian dishes, it makes me so very happy. \\n\\nMy mom ordered the eggplant Parmesan. She said it was the best she had ever had! It is nice that they give you good bruschetta at no charge!

They're a method to allow self-service on tastings when every bottle has a different price.

My only complaints are minor - mainly that they didn't have the fans on outside even though it was hot and that they bring you extra boats and napkins without asking if you need them.

Let's put it this way: If we were ordering from an unpriced menu, and/or if it was expensed, but if we showed some restraint and avoided gluttony, it probably would have been $30/head.

This was a first for both of us and we were presently surprised. I can see how parking could be an issue since we only found street parking but we lucked out in finding one not far from the restaurant at all. From the outside to even when you first walk in, you would think it's small restaurant...Looks can be deceiving because when were being seated we saw how big it really was. Plenty of seating in the back! We were seated withing 5 minutes ( and it was busy). The hostess and our server were sooo friendly..even the regular customers who were seated next to us were friendly. It was an overall friendly family oriented, small-town feel, environment. My sister and I were starving and wasn't sure in what to order, or how much to order. Luckily, we were seated next to this lovely elderly couple who warned us that the portions were big so we wouldn't have to order too much because we most likely wont be able to eat it all. They definitely were right. My meal came with 2 huge perfectly fluffy pancakes ( which i split with my sister), home fries, fried eggs,wheat toast, bacon and sausages. My sister ordered a cheese omelet with bacon and home fries. I still cant believe that this all came up to $22 ( coffee included). We both had plenty of leftovers to take home.

Instead of the delicious artisan bread we were served at first, they brought two baskets of what looked like mini hamburger buns opened up and heated flat. They weren't toasted, but slightly warm.

This is problematic because it appeared it was contaminated with wheat flour noodles. I actually ended up getting pretty sick from it, as I have an allergy... Sure they have a disclaimer for no gfree kitchen, but I don't understand how other noodles ended up in my pasta. My suspicion is they cook noodles together. That was a big negative to me! Their cocktails are delicious, and I did have a nice evening.. Other than the aftermath. Probably won't return, unless I get another gift card / they improve their menu. Or next time just go for drinks!"},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I have lived on the block here for going on five years. I loved Devlin's with all my heart, though it was much like described above. It was a dive, that knew it was a dive and it had six dollar cheeseburgers (awesome ones) and 2 dollar pabst when you didn't have the cash to spring for something better. I was saddened when it was gone. After it came a truly horrible place called \\"Madison's on the Avenue\\" and I could fill four pages telling you what was wrong with it. I was excited when I saw a new place was coming after it close.\\n\\nI have just returned from Highland Kitchen and I can't tell you how excited I am to have a place like this in the neighborhood. I met my girlfriend there for a drink after work ( a drink that turned into an unplanned dinner).\\n\\nEverything about the ambiance in the place works. It it, first an foremost, a pub (in terms of feel and atmosphere, anyway-- non-drinkers rejoice, it is still very much a restaurant). The colors are muted, the decoration well thought out but not over the top in the least. I sat at the bar and found a good selection on tap (the Smuttynose Seasonal and Victory Pilsner being the two I ended up drinking while there). Even the jukebox seems well planned-- blues from very early on up and through the 1960s (you'll find Leadbelly and Junior Wells), along with some great classic country (Hank and Mr. Cash, of course) with the occasional much appreciated curve ball thrown in including Tom Waits and Steely Dan.\\n\\nThe bartender was friendly sure (this may be an understatement-- since the bar wasn't busy, he went out back and MADE fresh hot chocolate for my girl after she inquired if they had any-- coming out with a pot of hot milk and whisking the chocolate in until it was right), but more importantly knew what he was doing. When we ordered a margarita, fresh limes were squeezed-- there was no sno-cone concession or horribly thick sour mix anywhere to be found.\\n\\nThe menu, especially, shows that they've taken the neighborhood into consideration. Crowd pleasers like cheeseburgers, pulled pork sandwiches and fried fish share billing with stuffed pork and mahi-mahi. And the prices work, too. While nothing is over 20 bucks anyway, you could still get a large bowl of soup or gumbo for five bucks, or one of the many old style bar snackies (like deviled eggs) for even cheaper than that. I went with a braised short-rib that was on special and was not disappointed. The texture was amazing (cooked all day fall off the bone), the collards greens and potatoes that came with it were spot on. My girlfriend had the cheeseburger and it was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nAnyway, this is not just a good neighborhood place. This is a good place, period. It maybe out of the way for many of you, but the 88 bus trip from Lechemere or Davis would be well worth it (or a simple 15 minutes walk from Davis when the weather is good). I hope people come out to support it cause it deserves to live."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"7913 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Wow, what great food and Brittany, what great service!!

I had a VERY HARD TIME rating this place.  It shines in the kitchen department, but they really need to fire at least some of their wait staff.  \\n\\nRino's is very small -- they can only seat 12-15 tables.  They do not take reservations except for parties over 6.  Now that they're famous, they are busier than ever.  Do not expect an easy time getting in.  We arrived at about 8:15, and were seated around 9:30.  Rino's is supposed to close at 9, so we felt lucky to get in.  I think we were the last party to be seated.  We started eating around 10ish.\\n\\nFirst of all, the food:  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  We had the famous lobster ravioli, and I fear I will never be able to eat lobster ravioli anywhere else.  Each big homemade ravioli was stuffed full of sizable lobster chunks and cheese.  The sauce also had large lobster chunks in it.  All told, there had to be about 1/4 to 1/3 pound of lobster on my plate, which is amazing in and of itself, especially for the price!  We looked around at what everyone else was eating, and everything looked amazing.  Huge portions, too.  My advice:  don't get any appetizers unless you plan to take most of your entree home.  You'll probably take some home anyway; even though we tried very hard to eat all of our ravioli, there was just no way.  Dessert was out of the question.\\n\\nNow for the service:  BAD.  The service deserves 2 stars, and that might even be a bit too kind.  I should be fair:  the hostess who took our name and got us on the list was nice enough, but I've had better waitresses pretty much everywhere else -- even in bad restaurants.  When our name was called, we were shown our table, but I couldn't sit down across from my husband as I wanted.  Why?  Because our waitress was standing where the chair was, and she was talking to her gal pals at the next table.  This is a small place, so it's not like she didn't know I was there.  I stood there for a while, thinking \\"she'll be done in a minute\\".  But no....  I felt kinda stupid standing there, so I ended up sitting next to my husband, which was fine.  The waitress came to serve us, and she was kind enough when she had a moment to talk to us, but neglected to refill our drinks as needed and check in on us.  She spent quite a lot of time at the next table talking to her friends.  I don't know if it was because we were the last people seated and they wanted to get out of there (we were not the last people to leave), or what.  The point is that our waitress seemed like she could care less.  I've noticed that other reviewers feel the same way about the service.  Perhaps they think that because they're famous and business is booming, service doesn't matter?  It's sad, because the food is awesome.  We are not gutsy enough to leave bad tips (we left the minimum 15%), but perhaps others will follow the advice of a friend of mine and \\"Leave 'em 5 cents so that they get the message!\\".  \\n\\nOther notes:  If you are wheelchair-bound, you will likely not be able to eat here.  Only a few steps into the restaurant, but the restroom is small and it's tough to navigate through the kitchen to get there.\\n\\nThere is a bar across the street where you can wait for your table.

Service was slow and flaky. We had to ask our waiters twice for our drinks- and considering that we ordered a bottle of wine for the table (good selection though), the task shouldn't have been too difficult. After about 30 minutes after we got our drinks, she finally got around to taking our orders. \\n\\nThe food was cold, tasteless, and simple requests for salt and ketchup took too long.

I should've taken a photo with you but there WILL be a next time lol. \\n\\nFriday is date night ! This Friday We set a reservation and missed it so we decided to not bother making a stink about it and chose to wait. They asked if we wanted to be inside or outside. We chose to sit outside. It was the perfect warm night so why not? We had a nice corner. We enjoy people watching so it was a really good spot. There were some Christmas lights on the trees which added to the Boston ambiance. \\n\\nNow on to the food....\\n\\nDrumroll  \\n\\nAMAZING!!! The kind of southern comfort food you need.\\n\\nIt was so hard for me to come here cause I am married to another southern restaurant (not even going to mention the name right now) but I cheated with Southern Kin House and I don't know if I can go back to the other place. I might be willing to divorce the other southern place. (Don't mind my weird lingo, I'm sure you understand what I'm getting at) \\n\\nThe fried okra, WAS AMAZING. It was crunchy but had a delightful sweetness when you bite into it. The ribs fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. (I have some left over and I'm gonna heat it up soon in like the next two minutes lol. ) The chicken had a delicious maple taste and the perfect crunch. My boyfriend hates corn, I've never seen him eat it in our 6 years together, so I was shocked to see him eat it here.?The macaroni and cheese, although a little watery, was phenomenal. Each macaroni was cooked perfectly and had the perfect chewy and creamy taste. \\n\\nWe got the bourbon pecan pie sooooo delicious. Jennyfer was kind enough to bring us different flavored ice cream to taste (Can you tell how much I love her?). From my understanding the ice cream comes from a place in Greenfield, MA. The ice cream was so creamy. I enjoyed the salted caramel the most. \\n\\nNow the Rose Sangria Pitcher...I cannot say enough of about it!! People walking by kept asking us what it was cause they were so amazed. We told them how great it was and each time said come back for it. It was sweet but the whiskey added a pleasant cinnamon after taste that just brought it to the next level. \\n\\nA place that gets 5 stars is a place that truly embodies delicious food and service and this place has all of it and then some.

I was ready to be taken to my Maker after sharing TWO (yes, I said two) flights of ice cream tasters here.  We walked in, asked the server to pick the flavors we should try and we went to town.  The server was delighted that we were ready to try anything.  He was giddy that we would trust him with our palettes.  And when we went to go sit down, he looked at us with envy... even saying he was jealous.  This was the way to do Salt and Straw for the first time!\\n\\nThe flavors my girlfriend and I tried:\\n\\n- Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons\\n- Strawberry honey balsamic with black pepper\\n- Mint chip\\n- Pear blue cheese\\n- Honey lemon with ricotta walnut cookies\\n- Almond brittle with salted ganache\\n- Cinnamon snickerdoodle\\n- Banana with spicy monkey caramel and walnuts\\n\\nLet me just say that ALL the flavors had REAL ingredients and flavorings in them.  The mint tasted like real mint.  The banana, real banana.  None of the weird banana type flavors you find in candy these days.  It was surprising and delightful.  Everything was amazing but I had my top 2 favorites.  Since Salted Caramel was what I was after originally, the Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons was on the top of my list.  It delivered.  But the Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper was an eye popping party in my mouth.  Every time I took a bite I fell in love a little bit more.  The 2 most surprising flavors were the Mint Chip and Pear Blue Cheese.  Both delicious.  And both different than what I thought they were going to be.\\n\\nYou can bet I will be back to try more flavors in the future!  Sure, the ice cream might seem on the pricey side.

The Atmosphere was nice, the bartender was sweet, the Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread was good, but when we ordered the $38 Seafood Platter for Two and 5 of the 12 pieces were bad, that's when we had a problem. They took the foul seafood away and offered us more. Why would we want more rancid seafood? The worst part is, is that the owner had made his presence known when they first brought out the seafood platter and he was excited for us to try his new seafood crackers that are these cheap, molded red plastic claws themselves, but as soon as he found out the seafood was bad, he didn't come over to us again, not even to apologize...Instead he enjoyed his dinner, 3 seats down from us at the bar, with a friend. BUT, we were offered FREE dessert to compensate for the bite I had taken of the bad seafood, how tacky is that? Then 49 Social proceeded to charge us for the $38 seafood platter that we only had a few things of off. We decided to pay our bill in full without saying anything, while I prepared my thoughts for this review.

I had the ravioli of the day, which was pumpkin ravioli (YUM!!!!! with brown butter, sage, dried cranberries, toasted pumpkin seeds and cranberry reduction) and he had the Ravioli Di Funghi.

I had a good time but the setup was very different than any other brewery tours I have been on. Think packed outdoor Austin festival. Here are things you should know:\\n\\nYou will be outside pretty much the entire time you are there. The only indoor spaces are the brewery itself which you will only go in during the tour portion and the small tasting room that has just enough space for the queue to get your beer. There's nothing wrong with the outdoor setup, they have picnic tables and nice scenery for you to enjoy. Just make sure you come prepared with your sun screen, comfortable shoes, and weather appropriate clothing. \\n\\nIt's easy to drive past the entrance on the long country road. Watch for a small sign low to the ground that will direct you to the parking area. We missed the entrance and saw this when we turned around. I don't think the sign actually said \\"Jester King,\\" it said something about parking for the pizza service they have, so look for that.\\n\\nThe pizza is ok. We ordered the Beatrice and I felt like it kind of lacked in flavor for the price. But when your drinking and have been outside for a few hours, you'll be hungry and will cough up the $14, everyone does. It took about an hour for our order to be ready which caused us to miss our tour. Make sure you have already gone on the tour or have over an hour before the tour starts when you place your order.\\n\\nThe beers Jester makes are very unique and they had a lot of sour brews. Be ready to taste some stuff you probably haven't tried before that may or may not be your thing. Even if you don't end up liking their beers, you'll leave with a pretty awesome glass that is worth the $10 to go on the tasting.\\n\\n\\nI think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew it was going to be a crowded outdoor thing before I went.

Why a 2? Service is slow, and unfriendly. Expect to wait 30 mins if you want to sit down. The menu is huge but the prices are downright ridiculous. For takeout we ordered 2 sandwiches and a drink and it was $30+. Place is always packed so some people aren't bothered by the price. I just think there are plenty of other options for sandwiches that charge almost half as much.\\n\\n(EDIT: Last time I was in here (Although I've sworn off the place, I was waiting for my car at Town Fair, check out that review) I had a pretty negative experienced. My husband met up with me for brunch and I ordered an open faced BLT. It sounded amazing - challah, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, topped with a poached egg. I am a big fan of runny yolks, but when I dug my fork into the egg it was completely raw - even the whites. I honestly have no idea how the eggs made it from the griddle to the dish without breaking they were so raw. I sent it back, explaining the issue, and a few minutes later they brought back my food). They did not replate it or remake the toast/bacon/lettuce/tomato which had all been covered in whites. So they were not only covered in raw egg white, but completely cold. And here's the kicker - they took the same egg that had been on top of the dish and recooked it, broken yolk and all, to a brown rubbery mess. I sent it back and the manager came over and offered me something else... At that point I declined, and the manager was extremely nice and apologetic about it and took it off the bill. I was bummed to leave hungry but without asking she gave us 2 black and white cookies, which were amazingly delicious. So, props to the manager for trying to make it right, but boo to the kitchen who failed twice)."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I feel bad giving this place only 3 stars, because the food itself was divine, but the portion sizes were just not cutting it, especially for those prices, and our waitress that night was 100% disinterested in us.

We were seated outside on a Saturday night as the hostess said we'd be seated quicker (we had a reservation). In retrospect we should've just waited because Megan, one of the 2 outdoor servers, was literally the worst person in the entire universe. For measure, I glanced at the table adjacent to us but inside the restaurant and I saw their server about 55 more times than I saw ours, a total of 4 times. Detailed below.\\n\\n1st time - We were seated for about 10 minutes before Megan stopped by. By then we already knew what we wanted to eat and order so it was quick and easy. To Megan's benefit she did help with ordering a drink.\\n\\n2nd time - She brought out our drinks. 2 of which were of the bottomless refill type (lemonade & sweet tea)\\n\\n3rd time - After someone brought out our food, she asked to see if the food was good. My drink was fill at this point so no refill was needed but it would've been nice to see her face again and to have more water & sweet tea & lemonade. The service definitely didn't fit the price point of the food.\\n\\n4th time - We finished eating and literally sat for 20 minutes and she still didn't show up. Also gave up on receiving a refill. Someone had to be flagged down and we asked them to alert Megan, however, Megan was no where to be found until eventually she walked over to the table to give us the bill.\\n\\nSo, in sum, god awful service, however because the food was really good I'd return.

I'm heading in a direction of flavorful eating, and you, well, you don't seem to want to keep up with these changing tides.\\n\\nThere was a day when I looked to you for that New Orleans comfort that I used to find in a shrimp or oyster po-boy. Your bread was close to that soft french bread from the Saintly city, and your sea critters tasted straight from the boat fresh. Only now, I notice that you've lost that flavor. Or maybe? Maybe you just never had it, but I was too blind to notice.\\n\\nShoal Creek, I've met someone else, and his name is Gene. His shrimp have a snappy coating that's obviously been hit with some Tony's Creole Seasoning or something like it. His catfish? Well, there's just no better on this planet. His bread is just as good, if not better than yours and at the end of the day, he doesn't charge me $10 for it all.\\n\\nWe had some good times Shoal Creek, but sometimes, you just have to move on.

Maybe that is just subjective on my part (isn't every review?) but I did not walk away at all impressed.  In fact, by the end of the night, I had come into a deep suspicion that the only reason why they present this food at all on small plates is so that they can charge you more for it.  For example, one of my dishes involved south asian influenced chicken wings that cost a pretty penny and left me gnawing at their bones (most embarrassing for a more upscale restaurant) because the meat was sparse and not tender.  \\n\\nThe drinks were better than the food.

Five guys is one of those chains that are really only get their fame from the hype. I ate at this location a few years back but never wrote a review. I've been to the 185th location twice and I decided to try this location again. I was not impressed. Maybe its because I've found another place that serves much better burgers. I don't know... but I do know I wasn't impressed with five guys.\\n\\nAs with any five guys, you walk in and choose what burger you want. Either a hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon or bacon cheese and what to have on it from the usual toppings and sauces. No special sauce here. Only ketchup, mayo and mustard. Same goes for the condiments. Want fry sauce or ranch for those fries? sorry. Only ketchup is found here. I guess thats fine, but in 2014 there should be more then just ketchup for fries....\\n\\nThe meat is cook their way so don't try to ask for the meat to be cooked a special way. They will refuse to do it. The only thing separating the main burgers from the \\"small\\" are the number of patties. \\n\\nThey have boxes of peanuts with small cardboard boats that you can scoop the peanuts in to and eat before your meal comes and during. People seem to love to toss the shells all over the ground when all they really need to do is toss the shells in another cardboard boat and toss in the trash when done. . They ask people not to take peanuts home with them as it can cause an allergic reaction. As if the allergic reaction can't happen in the restaurant. Go figure.\\n\\nWhen I got my food, it wasn't anything special. Burger tasted very bland, even with mayo, lettuce, onion tomato, cheese and bacon on it.  Its like they don't season the meat at all. The fries were the only good thing that I liked. Fries are fried in peanut oil and are crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. \\n\\nIf you really want a good burger, head over to Washington square and go to Fresh Grill.

But there was absolutely nothing good about my first experience.\\n\\nAfter reading over the menu I decided to try the chicken sandwich. The less than friendly woman behind the counter quickly told me that they were out of chicken sandwiches. Really? The restaurant serves 3 entrees: chicken sandwich, chicken biscuit and fried chicken. And they're out of chicken sandwiches? Shut down or send someone to Kroger for whatever you're out of! How pathetic for a new restaurant.\\n\\nI settled on the Chicken Biscuit and a side of Mac and Cheese. The decor incorporates bags of White Lily flour so I had high hopes about the biscuits coming of their kitchen. But. The biscuits were disgusting. The flour hadn't been sifted properly when they were made and the result left a less than desirable biscuit. Also... they were several, several hours (maybe a day or two) old. Don't get me wrong. I love old biscuits. Especially to make dressing or stuffing. But for a chicken biscuit? No.\\n\\nThe chicken inside the biscuit was cold and I couldn't taste any seasoning. Pepper and salt would do wonders. Are they using any of the hot sauce they've got in their window display in the chicken batter? It could use some. \\n\\nNow let's discuss the worst part of the meal. The Mac and Cheese. Kraft out of a box would've been better than this! If it wasn't two or three days old I will eat my hat. The Mac and Cheese had been sitting in the wax covered paper bowl it was served in for so long that the oil from the Mac and Cheese was seeing through the sides of the bowl. That doesn't happen in 30 minutes or even an hour. That Mac and Cheese had been sitting for a long time and it sure had a taste to match. It was absolutely gross. \\n\\nOh, and the sweet tea? Dear little baby Jesus. There was enough sugar in that tea to cause instant diabetes. The tea was so sugary it was thick. \\n\\nThis is a simple concept. It's fried chicken. It shouldn't be hard to execute. But the grumpy employees here have managed to make comfort food as gross as possible. \\n\\nUpdate: I brought a friend to the PCM and she picked Hop's for lunch. I was weary but didn't say anything as she apparently really liked it. My experience this time was better than last time. The chicken was fresh, hot and well cooked. But once again the sides were incredibly disappointing. And the price is still incredibly high when compared to the prices at neighboring restaurants.  It's also quite a bit higher than chick-fil-A but not any better.\\n\\nThese are merely my opinions.

First, let me me start by saying that I am a Southerner. I was raised in the South and I know how to make most of the foods that inspired the chefs at Southern Kin. It kind of 'is what it says it is'... the place is named Southern 'Kin'... not Southerners. That might be the thing. They are making food that is 'kind of like' real Southern food. The cornbread was more like a dense and sweet corn muffin; thick and mealy. Real cornbread is fluffier. The sweet tea was good, but whatever sugar product they used to sweeten it did not taste like real sugar. It was almost like a sugar syrup. The grits were cheesy, just as described, but they were bland. They should have salted the water before cooking them. The sausage gravy, on the other hand, was too salty. The biscuits were good and one of my two eggs was cooked perfectly. All in all, it was a pretty good effort, but they really need to get some subject experts in there to help them make the food taste a little more authentic. Our server was over-the-top sweet and friendly. I couldn't tell if she was really that nice or if she was trying to play the part of a Southerner.

Ok...sounds great..we ordered the lemon and Porto flan and the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce along with a couple glasses of wine.   The flan was good as was the wine. Unfortunately, the cake wasn't very good, it was quite dry and the sauce bitter.  We didn't finish the cake and the server asked if wanted to take it home - no thanks and we explained why. Again, she apologized and soon returned with the check.       \\n\\nThe server didn't make any adjustments to the bill for the questionable app's and dessert.  I spoke with manager and she asked 'what do you want ME to do...take it off the bill?' Uh, yeah,  when you serve raw meat and dry cake I expect some type of consideration. I kindly explained that server had not even offered to make things right and she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  \\n\\nMy GF needed to get her coat as the hostess took it when when entered the restaurant.  She was guided into a back room by the hostess who told to find her own coat...not very professional or helpful especially since we just spent more than $120 in their establishment.

The food is great, the place is not as noisy or crowded since it's very small, and there's no angry ladies pushing carts! It's very convenient to simply check off the items listed on the menu instead of having to wait for the right cart, reject the food that you're not interested in, wait some more, reject some more, and so on! They even have a menu with pictures to show you what the food looks like, for the dim sum virgins. The food is made fresh to order and comes out very quick.\\n\\nNow I'm not going to go into detail about all of the food here because it will span into an essay, but it's real solid dim sum food that you can't really find in Boston nowadays. I go out of my way to have the delicious chicken feet and sparerib rice and the shrimp rice noodle here, but everything else is also very tasty. \\nI have to note that the Sticky Rice on Lotus Leaf was frozen and re-heated, so it wasn't all that fresh. The portions are small on some dishes, not that I'm complaining because it still tastes good. \\n\\nI have never ordered from the 'non-dim sum' menu and I don't think I ever will, just like I would never order steak at an Italian restaurant. Don't quote me on this, but the items on that menu simply does not seem appealing, I could be wrong.\\n\\nThere is often a wait involved on weekends around the peak dim sum time (12-3pm). Consider sharing a table if you don't mind, it will shorten the wait time! Just pray that you don't get stuck with obnoxious preteens because it will definitely ruin the Winsor experience, I always take the risk simply because I get into a bad habit of waiting until I'm hungry to eat here!\\n\\nThe service can be very slow and the wait staff can be rude/indifferent at times, but then again, it's Chinatown, so who cares?"},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Really cute place with outdoor seating as well.

We were very warmly greeted by two young ladies/hostesses at the hostess stand and immediately felt welcomed by them. Restaurateurs should take notes on the friendliness of the ladies that work here ~ 5 stars for them!  One quickly led us to a table by the window facing the closed brick street/walkway (great seat for people watching).  The only negative, it seemed to be near the wall that the AC return flow circulated so it was a bit chilly. Our waiter came over fairly quickly and offered water as we reviewed the menu. Then he came back to review the specials and take our drink/app order.  We opted for water and ordered two starters:  the summer salad to share and a basket of onion strings.  Our starters came at the same time in a fair amount of time.  The onion strings were thin, crispy and came with a great dipping sauce that had a nice zing.  The summer salad was delicious, mixed greens, fresh blueberries, spiced pecans, goat cheese with a honey lemon vinaigrette dressing.  Complimentary warm rolls came shortly after the starters arrived.  For our entrees, I ordered the baked seafood medley (scrod/haddock, scallops and shrimp) with light breadcrumbs and two sides:  cole slaw and summer vegetables (sauteed yellow and green zucchini, peppers and onions).  The hubby, the fried scrod/haddock with two sides: cole slaw and sauteed spinach in garlic.  Our entrees arrived in a fair amount of time as well.  My seafood medley was a fair size for the price but wasn't as hot as most \\"seafood casseroles\\" as I have had at other establishments, possibly due to the fact that it isn't served in a casserole dish.  The seafood was cooked perfectly, not drowned in butter or bread crumbs.   The dressing on the cole slaw is very light and is somewhat bland.  The summer vegetables were perfect.  Hubby's fried scrod was piping hot and batter was crunchy. Ample amount of sauteed spinach which was cooked perfectly. Our waiter was attentive but not obtrusive and a manager did stop by during our dinner to check in with us.  Overall, a very good first experience with service and food.

I tried the pulled pork and it was served with tortillas and now after eating it that way I prefer it to a bun any day. The BBQ sauces are very unconventional too but a nice change from the traditional BBQ sauce. The smoke on the meat was slight and I didn't spot a pit anywhere. As we left I noticed behind a high fence one of those stainless steel wood pellet type\\nSmokers but since we are not talking southern traditional BBQ we will let them slide on that one. My beautiful wife sampled a trio of tacos that consisted of a pork belly taco with peanuts and pickled slaw with dragon sauce, a buttered chicken taco with tikka sauce and finally a chicken al Pastor taco all very delicious. Now the only downside is two fold and one of them may just be a personal pet peeve is put the sauces on the table. You ask for sauce and they bring you a tiny tablespoon cup and it's only half full. BBQ is about the sauce in most cases don't deny your customers access to the sauce. A lot of restaurateurs treat condiments as if they were gold!  Secondly don't punish the customer for want something substituted on the menu. I wanted to try the chicken and the pulled pork but the options offered were pulled pork and brisket option for 14.99 or or chicken and ribs for 17.99. If I wanted pulled pork and chicken I had to get the more expensive chicken and ribs platter and trade my ribs for Pulled pork. Can you say downgrade for more money? No thanks.

As I entered the store looking for supplies I needed, I confronted a clerk who was stocking merchandise. He took us all over the store, to help me find the 'must haves' in Sushi making.  I thought he was very helpful and had so much patience, since I had a ton of questions.\\n\\nThat night, I impressed myself in making my very first Sushi, that even the chefs from Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen are put to shame!  No training. It was hubby's first taste of  Sushi!  He wouldn't have eaten them, but he made sure what I was putting in are the foods he like to eat.\\n\\nI'm giving them 3 stars, because in the past, I bought something I think it was a young coconut and when I opened it, it didn't smell right.\\n\\nUpdate: I'm keeping my 3 stars. We went back again, 2012, because we were in the area. We always try to stop here when we're by there, anyways.  This time, we bought egg rolls, and the last slices from the letchun - roast pork Filipino style.  The letchun, well that's to be expected and I'm not complaining about it, it is the last slices left!  But the egg rolls?  It was leathery!  I took one bite and gave the rest to hubby!  This is a reason why I won't just buy ANY egg rolls from now on, no matter how much I'm craving for one.\\n\\nWe made some real Filipino Lumpias for New Years, hubby & I - our 3rd attempt, and we could own a restaurant selling just those.  Yeah, it was THAT good, and we won't buy anything ANYWHERE ELSE AGAIN."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It's taken me a little while to return to Rino's because I don't feel like waiting around for two hours before I get to eat. I ended up going back when my in-laws were in town and wanted to try the place my husband and I raved about. \\n\\nA couple of things irritated me this time around and I don't think I'll be heading back to Rino's any time soon. \\n\\nFirst, (and I've left a tip on Yelp about this) the refills on soda are not free. They don't tell you this ahead of time, and if you're like me you assume refills are on the house because that's how they are EVERYWHERE. Not here. They tally it up on the back of your check (out of sight out of mind I guess? either way I thought that was misleading) and never say a peep about getting charged for each refill. If I'm paying for a soda and need to drink it in moderation it might be nice if they at least warn you ahead of time. For a table for four people, each of us getting a refill or two over the course of appetizers and a meal, it adds up quickly.\\n\\nThat brings me to the service. Awful. The people working there treat the customers as if they should be happy to have gotten in for dinner, not the other way around. I get that they're busy and are popular, and people obviously go back so maybe it doesn't matter to them if they lose a few customers who aren't regulars. But I was annoyed that it took forever to get anything when it seemed that the regulars, or people the waitstaff were familiar with, got the royal treatment. \\n\\nNow, onto the problems with the food. My husband ordered the lobster ravioli, and it had shells in it. By this time the waitress was MIA so we just called it a day and got the check when she happened to come back over to check on us from chit chatting with another table. It just wasn't worth it to us to say something and we got the impression that it wouldn't have mattered much anyway.\\n\\nOverall, pretty annoying experience. I'd be willing to trade a bit of quality for improved customer service any day. And luckily we just found Fiorella's in Newton so we don't have to trade quality at all and the customer service there is impeccable."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went here on a lark (get it?) with some coworkers in town from San Francisco.

Salt & Straw in Portland has distinct differences than the ones in LA, one of which is the space-- Portland gives much more space to sit and enjoy your ice cream without being hustled and bustled out of the limited spacing LA's Salt & Straw chains provide. Still pricey ice cream because it is fancy ice cream. By fancy, I mean, just take a quick read on their flavors! Some will definitely surprise you with ingredients versus others. \\n\\nBecause my Portland takeover trip was around March (2016), I only felt it was suiting to get their limited edition Pot Of Gold.

It was horseradishy and good!\\n\\nNext, the ricotta doughnuts which are a must try.  Crispy, fresh to order, soft on the inside, lovely lemon curd to dip in.  So yummy.\\n\\nI ordered the biscuit with wild boar gravy, which did not taste gamey at all and not unlike just regular sausage gravy.. it was delicious though, the eggs were perfectly sunny and not underdone, and the kale on the side was a nice addition to what could have been a very heavy meal.\\n\\nMy friend got the famous duck hash which was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nWe ate it all and were perfectly full.  Service was decent - not too present and honestly we had no complaints and didn't need anything so a super-present server wasn't necessary anyway.  Everything was great.  No complaints.

I enjoyed it but I wish (and this might be pushing it) there were more options for someone who hated cilantro or items that can be made with or without cilantro. I hate when I can't get any salsa, but it happens.

The potato must've been the key to making the texture of this super dense & moist, while allowing it to have a thicker harder outside. The cream was sweet and went well, though was a bit thin/watery, making it logistically harder to deal with.\\n\\n* Erin's Sweet Biscuits (w/ huckleberries & whipped cream. $6) - 4.5 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=HKPzcSk52LgaQ2DYlHqapw#e7gS1hjECbSsdtBL2thwAg\\nVery nice!

This was very unique in that you didn't need maple syrup, but came perfectly with everything to complete the dish. The pear-maple & whipped cream weren't overly sweet, and the bread had a delicately thin layer of crisp to it, wrapped around a moist inside.\\n\\n* Moroccan Chicken Hash (w/ harissa cream & over easy egg. $14) - 4 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=HKPzcSk52LgaQ2DYlHqapw#kyBsEiV4WHD1Cu3JeJQg5Q\\npost egg-breaking: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland?select=HKPzcSk52LgaQ2DYlHqapw#T2ek9elOAcJXO9kHReTtEg\\nNot the most visually pleasing dish, but I was pleasantly surprised! The chicken looks blas√© but was actually pretty moist. This had a bit of a kick of extra flavor, and the potatoes were nicely crisped.\\n\\nPersonal self-note on the dishes we really wanted to order but weren't available: Shakshuka, Steak Cheddar n Eggs, & North African Sausage.

A lot of crab! and not excessively filled with bread crumbs like many other crab cakes I have tried. Lobster raviolli did live up to expectations. Packed with lobster, and huge pieces of lobster in the sauce! Sauce was delicious!\\n\\nCons: SERVICE. This service was just horrible. Everyone there is absolutely rude. The owner (i believe) even came up to us, out of the blue, and started complaining about elderly people! There were clearly elderly people seated all around us. Very unprofessional, I just hope they didnt hear him!\\nAnd  trying to call Rino's, they are the most rude people over the phone, there is absolutely no costumer serivce and they don't seem to be in the business of pleasing their costumers in anyway outside of preparing and delivering their food to them.\\nMy salad came and my brother's salad didnt come from about 10 minutes later.  It was very strage. And the waitress made a comment along the lines of  \\"this came right from them kitchen\\" when she dropped my brothers salad off. Okay? Then were did my salad come from?\\nThe fried mozzarella appetizer was honestly the worst I have ever had. And I am a good judge on this because I order this appetizer EVERYWHERE. They obviously did not drain the mozzarella before frying it. It was discustingly watery. A dissappointing waste of $11!!!\\nThe dinners came a full 30 minutes after we had finished our salads. The waitress said it was because they had so many appetizer orders they wanted to get those prepared and served first. Umm okay???? I mean I dont know restaurant practice or what the norm is, but that just seemed like a strange idea to me. \\n\\nAnyway after finally getting to dine at Rino's after numerous attempts to get in, but being rudely rejected because of a ridiculous wait time, I would have to say it was a dissapointment.

The biscuits and corn bread were delicious!  The portion sizes are large and filling. Then to top it off, the pastry/pie chef came over with 6 different slices of each pie that are made fresh at 4am every morning.

Well, the daily specials are now not so special - they are always the same (they're now enshrined on the printed menu). The dessert menu didn't ever get improved either, it's the same three poor items. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and (biggest crime of all) we got the \\"SORRY NO SUBSTITUTES\\" line when I asked for cheese fries instead of the bland crappy fries they have. Poor Form.\\n\\nDisappointed that they are already going downhill. Won't be back in a long while now.\\n\\n======= ======= =======\\n\\n\\nI go on the 2nd night and I'm already the 3rd to review? Damn! They should've especially opened for me last Saturday when I stood outside disappointed at the coming soon sign and trying to think of new options for my meal. Drat! I guess the buzz is due to the Gastropub theme being so successful at B-Side and Green St, combined with the location being just about the only place to eat and drink between Davis Sq and The McGrath Hwy. It certainly got me.\\n\\nSo here's the deal - it's an open-plan pub / diner with cleaned-up decor, a decent beer, wine and cocktails menu and a reasonably cool menu of comfort foods and southern classics. And, true to the Gastropub idiom, there were daily specials on a chalkboard which is exactly what we hit up.\\n\\nFYI our starters were the scallops in celery root sauce and the chili cheese fries and our mains were the shortcut rib on mash with collards, the mahi mahi tuna and the roast chicken with turnip mash. Our deserts were chocolate cake, apple crisp and banana bread pudding - each coming with a scoop of ice cream.\\n\\nThe food was all good, but nothing was outstanding in the way that it beats the competition hands down. eg. I loved the chili cheese fries, but B-Side's blue cheese fries is a notch up. I was a disappointed with the desert choices but as they gave us those on the house (YAY!!) I'll hazard a guess and say they are working on that.\\n\\nOur server was fantastic; telling us about the refit, letting us know the choices and generally being a charming dude. All the staff here were great, seems like they're all very excited with their new jobs. And why not? They're at the heart of the new dining movement - fine food in a comfort setting - and that's what I love about this place.\\n\\nFor now, four stars. Great that we have another Gastrodiner, but to compete with B-Side and Green St they will need to add more experimentation to the menu and more character to the bar."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great place...cant really say anything bad.

How have I not discovered you sooner? \\n\\nLast night we had a fabulous meal at Ava Cucina. As I write this, I am eating my leftover Linguine with Clam Sauce for lunch and it is just as delicious as it was last night. I went with two of my girlfriends; 2 of us started with red wine (delicious!) and the other got the Stella Artois on tap. We sat at the bar, where we were promptly greeted with a warm welcome and hot rolls. For appetizers we got their fried calamari and the special of the evening, mushroom ravioli. Both dishes were superb, and the bartender was even kind enough to bring extra bread to sop up the phenomenal mushroom cream sauce from the raviolis. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, I ordered the linguine with a white clam sauce for my entr√©e and it was fantastic. My mom makes an awesome linguine with clam sauce and this rivaled hers, with lots of fresh herbs, pasta cooked to perfection, a surplus of clams--whole in the shell and chopped!  I tried both my friends' dishes, Chicken Parmesan and the evening special, Eggplant Napoleon. Both were served over pasta with Ava's homemade tomato sauce which was excellent. I forgot to mention that before our dishes arrived we were served a complimentary garden salad that was fresh and flavorful. I love when restaurants do this. \\n\\nDespite our full bellies, the bartender sold us on one of their filled-to-order canolis. The shell was crisp and super fresh and the ricotta filling reminded me of Mike's in the North End.

Both dishes are excellent and bring together two distinct  flavors and traditions from the Far East and the Mediterranean.

I decided on the seafood linguine (chopped prawns, Dungeness crab, olive oil, garlic, chilies, lemon zest, tomato and fresh tarragon).  First, the dish was huge. I mean, it was so huge that three people could've shared it and felt pleasantly stuffed. I barely ate half, which seemed like a waste but I just had no room. Secondly, it was bland. The dish didn't really taste anything, which was disappointing. Lastly, I've decided that chopped prawns don't work for me. The dish would have been visually more appealing if the prawn were served whole. Also, I had to dig through my pasta to actually find prawn bits. I would give this place another shot, but try something else. \\n\\nI did make room for the local berries and balsamic + whipped marscarpone and mint. It was nice and refreshing.

It wasn't terrible, but a restaurant with a 4.5 star rating and almost 400 reviews should be phenomenal. I'd say our meal was mediocre.\\n\\nIt started with the host. We came in around 6:45 PM, and they said our wait would be 1.5 hours. We were happy to go walk around in the meantime, but they texted us within 30 minutes to say our table was ready. It was a welcome surprise, but the degree of miscalculation was a little strange.\\n\\nThen there was our waiter. It took awhile for him to greet us and take our oyster order. After that we ate our oysters and then sat and waited, and waited, and waited. After awhile we were so hungry we had to actively search for him and flag him down to come take our order. He wasn't particularly apologetic about the delay.\\n\\nThen there was the food. We had the calamari appetizer - it was tasty but nothing special. I also had the \\"award-winning\\" lobster bisque. It literally tasted like a bowl of heavy cream with a handful of small pieces of dry lobster. I tried to just fish out the lobster pieces since I couldn't bring myself to drink down the cream.\\n\\nAt our table, we also had the salmon and sole entrees. The salmon was dry, and the sauce didn't match. It came with a side of brussel sprouts drenched in sweet sauce and an overly fried risotto cake. Everything that came with the sole entree was overly buttery. \\n\\nIn sum, a mediocre meal not at all befitting of a 4.5 star restaurant. On the plus side, the decor is nice.

I found it interesting that yje vegetable quesadilla had brocolli, carrots, and cauliflower as I was expecting more of a peppers vegetable quesadilla, but it was still good. The kids portion was very good. All the food came out hot. My husband had the el pablo and he thought it was okay. He wishes it had more steak and it had a lot of onions on the plate.

We frequent this restaurant often. The service has always been quite slow. I am willing to over look that for a quality meal. Tonight, we came early (knowing you would be busy with Father's Day). At 5:15 you were on a 1.5 hour wait while I could count seven empty tables within eyesight. You had two and four tops open. We were a party of 5. We would have gladly say at a four top with a chair on the end. Your hostesses were ARGUING with another customer about his 'reservation/wait'. Your hostesses seemed clueless and argumentative. When I inquired about all the empty tables and lots of people waiting the answer was because you had several large parties. Shouldn't that be expected on a holiday? Shouldn't you have been staffed to accommodate the needs of your customers? I have overlooked slow service in the past. With so many dining options in the Pickerington/Reynoldsburg area, you shouldn't be trying to alienate your customers. We headed on over to Longhorns (who was much busier) and waited 15 minutes.

The buns are dry too. I think Costco hot dogs have better soft buns. Clutch hot dog comes in a fancy box but hard to eat, just a simple tin foil would be better. $9 for a box of kale salad! which didn't taste that good is boo :(...  ($4 for the raw veggie and maybe $5 for the cost of the fancy box). They are expensive. $36 lunch (two hot dogs; 1 salad, 1 bag of chips, and 1 can of beer)  - is way too pricey!  if they had made it like the Oregonian Live review article said like Otto Sausage on SE Woodstock with a fun grill - the restaurant would have been more well received here in Cedar Mill... this is a former lumber mill town.. we like fast, cheap, good food that's family friendly.

Located a few blocks from the hub of the Winter Park bourgeois is this charming restaurant.  It had been on my epicurean sonar for quite some time running silent, until my necessity to sate my appetite for great food sent a single ping and this establishment responded back in kind. \\n\\nBe attentive when looking for this spot as it is a free standing building that can be a bit tough to see due to its muted signage at night.  There is a private lot to serve its patrons with complimentary valet service.  The restaurant does 'psych' you out initially by having a large arrow pointing to another entrance hanging at the double doors which face the lot and sit right under the awning with the name \\"Cask & Larder.\\"\\n\\nA cute little 'bush' garden (no Tampa theme park pun intended) runs around the building until you arrive at the 'real' entrance.  \\n\\nThe interior is split into two sections; bar and main dining room.  From the looks of it there is also an available private area that fits within the confines of its brewery section, where one can dine while surrounded by 'wanna-be' Wizard of Oz tin-man look-a-likes that instead of looking for a heart, they just brew you some beer, fooled once more by the charlatan, Oz.\\n\\nThe bar area is spacious and accommodative with high tops, booths, and seating is available at the bar itself (see my pictures).  Unique specialty drink options are available here that you may only find in select bars scattered around town.  Should one choose to do so, they may opt to dine in the bar area instead of waiting for a table in the main dining area.  If you're lucky enough you may be able to get yourself a nice little romantic round table by the front windows.\\n\\nThe main dining area is well lit and set up.  Not dim to the point of needing night vision goggles, or looking like they are a few months behind on their power bills.  It is decorated much like I would envision a farmer's market should one ever be assembled into a restaurant.  \\n\\nThe server although a bit overbearing in letting us know what she enjoyed the most, was courteous and did a fine job.  There is a large board mounted on the wall near the kitchen area which lists the fresh options of the day, you know, that fancy fish that flew in first class, up in the sky, pop the champagne, living the life in the fast lane...wow, I'm going to stop here.  You get the idea.\\n\\nI'm a big fan of their 'quality over quantity' menu; unlike the T.G.I.Friday's bible that comes with a study guide to help you find and select your entr√©e.  Creative divine choices are available to please your palates.   One tip:  since these are specialty dishes with unique pairings, substitutions are hard to come by with regard to sides and garnishes.\\n\\nIn my pictures you will see my plate of choice, the Veal Brisket accompanied with potato gratin, an apple-brussel slaw garnish, and jus.  The protein's taste was fantastic and the texture was soft like a recently 'snuggle' washed towel.  I was not a big fan of the amount of under cooked fat, but since it is an imperative part of the overall flavor, I quickly overlooked it.  The potato was so good it could pass for a faux mozzarella stick that just left a fancy cocktail party.  I'm no fan of any slaw, but this one was on my 'edible' list, so a definite plus.\\n\\nDesserts were also ordered and much to our financial contentment, they were graciously covered by management due to our long period of time waiting for them to come out, almost as long as Ricky Martin.  The S'more Pie (see my picture) was an amazing combination of flavors, as if a campfire memory had suddenly bonded with a formal event and an episode of Top Chef focused on desserts and this was the result.\\n\\nOverall, this ranks up there with The Ravenous Pig (see my review) as one of the gems in the area I've come to affectively call SOPA; south of Park.  Go here and definitely check them out!!\\n\\nCheers!"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My new favorite place in Austin.

I ordered my meal offline, (no complaints there) and showed up about 20 minutes later to pick up my order. Upon entering the establishment I immediately noted the filthy floor, windows, and the door handle which was covered in a buttery grease. (for the love of all that is holy PLEASE clean the front of your store!) Right then and there i should've just walked out.... but my pizza cravings were strong. I waited patiently in line behind another lady who was placing her order, only to hear the counter attendant arguing with her saying that she needed to call in and place an order or order online and that she couldn't order from the counter?! (never heard of that rule, doubt it exists)  After further arguing for about 5 minutes he proceeded to tell her \\" this could get me fired, but ill act like you called in and ill take your order, after all I'm here for the tips\\". EXTREMELY RUDE. While they were exchanging her order a secondary employee who was quite unclean looking proceeded to come up to the counter and complain to myself and the other patron about how she hates taking pone orders from \\"bratty kids\\"... and it's \\"so annoying\\". \\n  Moving on to when I get to the counter, I tell the attendant i know im a little early but im here to pay for my order and i tell him my name. He doesn't greet me, or anything, he just stares blankly at me until i hand him the cash... where i he proceeds to tell me \\"I cant take that\\" (i had tried to pay with a $100.00 bill.)I asked why and he proceeded to tell me its company policy that he cant accept 100.00 or 50.00 bills because i could have made counterfeit money. So i end up having to walk next door to chipotle to break my hundred (very nice crew of young gentleman, it was no problem for them.) I return to the store to pick up my food. he takes my cash, hands puts a stack of boxes in front of me and walks away. I stood there waiting for my change for a few minutes before i finally shouted towards the back for someone.... the attendant re appeared and when i inquired about my 14 dollars in change he proceeded to say \\"oh i thought that was my tip\\". \\n\\nFood:\\nAfter returning home, my pizza and sides were cold, toppings incorrect and just thrown in a disarray. \\n\\nMoral of the review, I feel no need to write to corporate about this store... beings that even if they did try to correct the issue i would still not return.

It wasn't THAT bad, but I've certainly had better, and seeing how its basically on the outskirts of the North End, you certainly don't have to go far to find it. I guess if you're comparing quality to price, us patrons are certainly getting the short end of the stick here. \\n\\nThe decor? Yeah, it kinda looks like it probably did when it established itself back in the day. But I can let that slide; you can't judge a book by its cover, and the same goes for a restaurant. \\n\\nThe service? This is when my sense of humor came in handy. We basically had a honey badger of a waitress: she really didn't give a $h*t!! Smacked her gum the entire time. Laughed at her mistakes and lack of professionalism. Had no idea what dish she brought out and had to take it back to ask the kitchen. Disappeared when we needed a water refill or the check. Offered items she didn't even have. Thank god my table was able to just laugh about it and enjoy each other's company. \\n\\nHoney badger would be a great waitress at Dick's Last Resort. They should recruit her.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in the position I was, having no choice but to go here, just eat a sandwich before you arrive and go with your expectations set reallllly low.

The place is pretty much the same as other salad places I've been to (except I don't think this place does delivery). \\n\\nThe downside is that they didn't have as many choices that I would have hoped for. I.e. not enough veggie add ons (the avocado was only a spread instead of fresh chopped avocado)\\n, not as many dressing choices as I hoped for and not a large variety of meats. \\n\\nThe upside was that the meats were freshly cooked (the ham was grilled just before adding it to the salad), there was a decent variety of choices and portions were great. \\n\\nIt's a great healthier alternative to subway.

No joke: you can fill up on a lot of food here EASILY for under $6. The menu is authentic, filled with things like chile relleno, tomales, burros, tacos, and home-made fruit juices and lemonade. The tacos are traditional, made with two corn tortillas filled with whatever meat you want (one of which is chorizo with potatos) and topped with (marianated?) tomatoes. You can add hot salsa, which is available at the counter if you want to turn it up a notch. The people behind the counter are quite friendly, and they make good use of their small space by filling it with large tables for friends and family to sit. My only complaint would be that I felt the tomatoes weren't exactly fresh, they had that harder quality to them that you get when you buy the tomatoes at Shaws that were delivered that morning, and I prefer the inside of the tacos with the traditional cilantro and onion, not tomatoes. Also, the tomales were good, but I've had better (although not in Massachusetts). Since you're looking here and interested in Latin American food, try out Tacos Lupita as well - another great place also in Somerville.

The shellfish were mighty plump, tender, and tasty, with nary a speck of sand.  For $5, this was a total steal.

They have self serve coffee for you while you wait - something I always appreciate. Our wait was modest, only about 20 minutes I want to say, not too shabby! We were seated at the bar, which I often enjoy because you get watch the magic in the kitchen happen. \\n\\nI ordered the Americanized Croque Monsieur - which is basically a Croque Madame. My friend got the Go Home Thomas - a fancy version of the classic breakfast sandwich. The Croque Monsier was stellar!! It also came accompanied with a yummy green salad. Everything was executed to perfection: the ham was thinly sliced and stacked, the gruyere was melted perfectly, eggs perfectly sunny side up, and the mornay sauce was thick and decedent! My friend loved her sandwich which featured two scrambled eggs, house ground sausage, a house made English muffin, and greens!  On the side was what they call a potato rosti - which seemed like a cross between hash browns and a latke. She loved it! \\n\\nI really enjoy and appreciate when a place takes the extra effort to make most of their stuff in house and uses local ingredients too. Toast is a shinning star in a city full of delectable brunch places. I will say it is a bit pricey, but I will gladly pay a higher price tag for high quality delicious food.

There was no one to greet us so we just signed our name. \\n\\nAn awkward exchange ensued with the person behind the counter, who wasn't a bartender, but if you serve alcohol as an establishment, you should be ready to serve them to the people waiting. There was confusion as whether it was okay for us to ask for drinks and the person behind the counter, moderately unoccupied, seemed to laugh at the fact that we might ask. \\n\\nThrough some assuming we followed the crowd and took coffee. What ensued was an hour and ten minute wait. An hour and ten minutes. It's fine, if your food is good and its the height of the brunch hour, I can wait. \\n\\nAfter being seated we were seemingly rushed into making a decision as to what to eat. The waitress was less than accommodating. She told us what they were out of and wasn't really helpful in helping us determine what we wanted.  \\n\\nWhat began as a pleasant breakfast became less than desirable. The waitress assumed we weren't going to want coffee because we got drinks. She asked me if I wanted cream with my coffee and then I had to ask her to bring it to me. She didn't refill our water. \\n\\nThe food was okay. It really wasn't as good as some people here make it out to be. The toast was burned. The eggs were too warm (not hot) and made me queasy. I needed the coffee, which was also not that hot, to keep me from losing it. The only good thing from my meal was the potatoes of which there were too many. \\n\\nPerhaps the most egregious part of the meal, another person from the wait staff comes over and asks \\"are you almost leaving? It's just that we have a lot of other people waiting.\\" We waited an hour and ten minutes for our table, too much time for our food and threw down $75. They can wait.

We have been a devoted follower of Kelly's for the longest time but over the years it has become more and more mass-marketed rather than that hidden gem it use to be. So naturally we go on yelp and search up roast beef and fried clams in the boston area. Royal stood out since all the reviewers seem to know Kelly's. Excited and hungry we drove to Royal. \\n\\nWe were feeling a little lost as we drove down this residential street with houses on both sides then we saw the lighted sign. There are a few parking spots in front of the shop and on the side. The place was completely empty but it was 11 PM on a Saturday night. The menu was crazy extensive with everything from subs to baklava. We knew exactly what we wanted, I got the regular, my date got the super (on onion roll) with bbq sauce and a large order of fried clams. \\n\\nWe sat in front of the counter drooling, waiting for our food. It was kind of weird when they actually have people bring the food to you instead of just calling you over to grab it like Kelly's. The first turn off was definitely the size and the wrapping. My regular looked like a McDonald's hamburger. It was completely flat. If that's the regular, I can't imagine what the junior looks like. The super wasn't that much better. The diameter of the bun is bigger but it was just as flat. We looked at each other and took our first bites. The bun was nice and toasted but that's about all that was good. The bbq sauce tasted very artificial, like someone tried way too hard to make it bbq-y, the beef was dry and tasteless. The super was about the same. The first few bites we convinced ourselves that it was just because the edges of the roast beef is always more well done so the rare parts in the center should be better...nope...just the same dry tasteless weird bbq stuff. We finished it anyway since we haven't eaten anything since 3 in the afternoon. \\n\\nAt this point we were really really looking forward to the fried clams since the sandwiches left little be to desired. The wait was a little awkward, since it was a good 10 mins after the sandwich when the clams came. We giddily ripped open the bag to the smell of greasy clams.  Emphasis on the greasy part...the little things (they really were smaller than usual) were practically glistening in oil.  I stabbed one out with my fork and looked at it for a second before throwing it in my mouth.  Bite...crunch...grittiness...ewwww...it's sand-y.\\n\\nOk, maybe it's just the first one since my date is just munching away.

It seemed like the perfect spot to grab a quick bite, and it most definitely satiated.\\n\\nThe spot is small, but by no means tiny (beyond the 2-car parking lot). After you scan the options on the chalkboard wall, order at the register and grab your meal to go or nab one of the tables in the decently sized bright pink dining area off of the main room. They've got 6 or 7 sandwiches and salads for you to choose from along with a bevy of sides: some in the regular rotation with others serving as specials. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken salad on a grilled croissant and it was mighty tasty. There was absolutely zero indication that the croissant was grilled, but it was nonetheless flaky and delicious. The chicken salad was also good, complete with craisins, pears, and all sorts of yummy goodies inside. Certainly a solid sandwich. \\n\\nThe prices are a bit high, as you'd expect to get a side included with the  sandwich when you're paying close to $10 after tax. Add in a drink and you've got a pretty pricey meal, far above and beyond what you'd expect for a sandwich shop.

It was pretty expensive...topping out close to $20.\\n\\nChicken was overcooked and a little dry, though It had good flavor...I had to bathe the meat in tziziki sauce to make it edible. Accompanying rice is thoroughly unseasoned and oily.  Accompanying salad was some sad lettuce, 1 tiny wedge of tomato, and a small amount of feta sprinkles.  The mark of a good Greek/mediterranean salad is their dressing...what i got was another container of the same tziziki sauce I got with the kabobs and falafel.  The falafel was also overfried to death...dark brown and very dry.  It was a good thing I asked for extra tziziki sauce...I needed it to make the food edible.\\n\\nAt the risk of sounding a bit Grinch-like, I also had to put up with a few drunk Midtown bros and their catty girlfriends while waiting for my order. I know Agora can't help who their clientele is, but they also could have prepared my order faster, but it was quite the opposite...it took at least 20 minutes. The manager tried to make it up by offering shots of bourbon to everyone waiting for their food...um, no...I would just like my order so I can get out of there away from you people.

My gamebird pate en croute was very nice and the Pork Rillette I ordered was quite good.  The steaks that followed these up were excellent.  Really excellent.  Cooked, and seasoned, perfectly.\\n\\nBut again, I have to go back to my original comment: it's way too popular for the size and it's very expensive.  As to the first of these, it's not their fault and you've been warned so don't expect anything less than a long wait.  As to the second, it does seem overpriced.  But I've seen other places with prices almost as expensive, where the quality wasn't even half as good.  It's still overpriced, but at least we got quality for the price.\\n\\nSo I guess the point is that while I hated waiting that long, and the bill was horrifying for three people, there isn't anything about The Butcher Shop that I shouldn't have expected, and nothing that's really their fault.

For our table of four, we received two baskets - each with one scone and one piece of bread. They told us the bread is sweet so butter is not required. Well, I love sweet bread and this was the driest bread I have been served! Normally baked goods come with an assortment - as the Beehive does - but this was not assorted and also not good! I could not eat it. Then we received the wrong drinks. The waitress tried to tell us they were correct, but we know the difference between Champagne and wine! We had one child who wished to order off the adult menu. He selected one first course and then for the second course requested one of the main courses from the much cheaper child's menu. He was told he could not combine, even if we were paying the adult price of $35 instead of the child price of $15.It just could not be done. The main courses were nicely prepared and with interesting flavors. But when the meal starts with a no choice stale bread and wrong drinks, and you can't get what you want to eat even if you are willing to pay a lot extra, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

I ordered the CLT (Candied Chicken, Lettuce, Tomato) and the apple arugula salad, fries with garlic aioli, and a glass of the Avery White.  \\n\\nThe first 5 bites of the CLT were amazing, but then it became too much- which is saying a lot b/c my lunch companion and I split the sandwich.  My lunch partner realized pretty quickly that the \\"C\\" was crispy chicken skin.  The thing about crispy skin is, you always want it, but you never want much of it.  When you carve the turkey on Thanksgiving, you eat a mouth or two full, bu then you're good...  So five bites in, I just took the \\"C\\" out.  The rest of the sandwich was perfectly done and a great marriage of flavor.  \\n\\nThe fries were obsenely amazing, especially dipped in the garlic aioli.  5 stars for that.\\n\\nThe apple and arugula sald was 90% apple.  I think I saw three to four leafs of arugula.  So understand you are ordering an apple salad.  It had grilled cheese that was cold, which I couldn't figure out, but overall it was light and a good palette cleanser.\\n\\nThe waitress was attentive, knowledgable and pleasant.\\n\\nThe ambiance was masculine and had a really rich, almost mahogany vibe...

The previous restaurant was small, but had this really warm, amazing atmosphere. Eating meals there always felt as if I stumbled on a great secret. It was always packed, but accommodating. Now, I don't harbor those same fuzzy feelings for this restaurant, especially with all the other Brazilian restaurants in the area. The food has really taken a turn for the worse (compared to what is used to be) in the last year and a half. It's just not as flavorful. I don't know if management has shifted, but it's not the same. I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because of how good it USED to be, and I'm hoping that it will get better one day sooner rather than later. I will say that the smoothies are good there, so I don't feel as bad now about giving it 3 stars.

I poured myself some coffee from the counter and noticed the only sugar option was a green packet of a sugar substitute from the raw sugar I'm used to having.  I shrugged and tried it: tasted like barkdust yuck.  My friend agreed it had a bitter after taste.   \\n\\nOur name was on top of the list but something was a little off.  Other people came in and would get seated promptly.  After a while, we finally got seated in the back room.  Service was 50/50 - consistent at times and other times we waited before coffee and water refills would take place.  The items on the menu looked interesting so we all ordered various plates.  The food arrived in a timely manner and they did look pretty impressive by its presentation alone.  The portions are not huge however and the price is a little higher than other brunch spots.  The flavors of each plate was alright, a little bland at times, and just average.  The pork belly was pretty small considering the price tag and my friend was still hungry after that.\\n\\nThis spot is definitely one of my top choices for brunch.  It seems the place was better a few years ago based on earlier reviews.  The service is much left to be desired and definitley could leave room for improvement.

I am comfortable enough to say I am a fan of this place! It is a great lunch place and good for quick dinners. \\n\\nI'm a brisket girl. The fattiest piece off that cap fat is mine. It fat make its oh so juicy and tender at the same time protecting all the meat from the heat. It is extremely tender but I'm warning you the seasoning on the outside layer could sky rocket your blood pressure through the roof because of the sodium level. However, I still dig it. The rest of the meat variety are okay. My next fave would probably be the prime rib but sandwich style. The dinner style has it sliced pretty thin and I think that is such a waste of a good lookin steak. I only like sliced pork very thin. (I know i'm picky!!)\\n\\nOn to the sides, my current faves are their jalapeno sweet corn bread, roasted corn and cole slaw. In my opinion the corn bread wins miles over their biscuit. It is sweet, moist, light on the top but gets denser toward the bottom and has a kick from the jalapeno. The biscuit recipe could use a little tweaking because its often kind of dry and not warm. The sad thing is that adding butter to it doesn't help much. Bummer. Any ways, back to my other faves. The roasted corn is smokey and delicious and the cole slaw is refreshing against all the warm offerings. \\n\\nI think the best idea is to get a dinner plate (~10-17 dollars) and split it into 2 meals. I promise there will be plenty if you can control yourself and not eat the whole thing in one sitting. \\n\\nThe Sweet Shop is here too but I can't comment on that cause I honestly don't remember how I felt about it since I haven't ordered in awhile. \\n\\nLunch around this area is getting pretty popping.

Unable to contain our excitement, we arrived promptly for our reservation and were told that our table would be ready in a few minutes. 30 minutes later, there was no table and the hostess did not check in with us at all. To make matters worse, a couple who had a later reservation was seated ahead of us. The Butcher Shop tried to squeeze as much seating as possible in its small space that there was no typical \\"podium\\" where the host usually stands. We had trouble flagging down the hostess on duty that night simply to ask about the status of our table. \\n\\nThe hostess, when we finally caught her attention, made little effort to improve the situation especially consider that the Butcher Shop was a higher end steakhouse and a part of a well-know restaurant group. I could have easily pictured the steakhouse up the street comp us with a drink or similar by the time the diners had to wait 30 minutes for a reservation. What was equally unacceptable was that the hostess essentially told us that there was nothing she could do and without prompting, told us we wouldn't want to be the diner forced to leave. We found this comment rather presumptuous as we have never asked anyone to be removed from the restaurant for us to be seated. \\n\\nLet's just say we left the restaurant without eating and went to another well-known steakhouse about 10 minutes away.

I wasn't overly impressed. \\n\\nThere were approximately a dozen wait staff standing around the bar while we were waiting to get drinks (we had special arrangements for drink tickets through out organization and had to order some of our drinks from the bar) but only two bartenders. They have a large selection of higher-end  and craft beer and liquor, which is great, but I felt lost trying to pick something because they have no descriptions of any of the drinks. That, combined with only two bartenders, meant it took awhile for everyone in our group to get a drink.\\n\\nWhen we had table service later we had multiple issues. The first waiter we had didn't want to split tabs--he made that very clear in a very passive agressive manner. His shift ended and another member of the staff took over. She seemed confused multiple times about who was ordering what and who was paying for who and it wasn't that complicated. \\n\\nWe had cheese and bread plates, which were generally excellent. The excption was whatever the pickled vegetable thing was on the tray. It was flavorless and mushy and gross.

For our main course, it took a while to decide what to get as there are so many great choices on the menu.  We were unoriginal and each of us got the same dish - French onion soup with the salad platter.  It was raining outside and this really hit the spot!

For those like me, who like to replicate experiences, this may be a disadvantage because the next time you come around, they may not have that dish that you really liked on your last visit. Then again, it may not matter at all, because Cask & Larder has complete control of what comes out of the kitchen and will most likely provide another pleasant dish.\\n\\nI think that the best way to experience this place is to definitively pair a drink (beer or cocktail) with a dish. On my latest visit with friends, I ordered a Larder Lager (beer), some Jerk Ribs, and the Nashville Hot Chicken. Since the menu rotates, these dishes may not be available anymore, but to your benefit, pairing will allow you to enjoying Cask & Larder to the max.\\n\\nThe Larder Lager got to the table before the meal, obviously, and it looked like any ordinary beer. It had good aroma, I didn't find that outstanding, but very promising. The taste, on the other hand, was incredible. The beer had three distinct herbs present in the taste, which I can't remember now, but something like Belgian yeast and rosemary or sage. It was a very flavorful beer, not the type beer drinkers like, but very \\"gourmet\\", very well made, and a little bit thicker than usual.\\n\\nI paired this with the Jerk Ribs first. The ribs were extremely aromatic. They were not very hot, but they were a bit spicy. The jerk rub was like a glaze on top of the ribs, and the ribs were a vehicle transporting the aroma of cloves and thyme. The aroma and the taste of the jerk rub was very present. \\n\\nSecondly, I had the Nashville Hot Chicken. Again, chicken in a rub. This time, the rub was more aggressive and very dry, and a bit spicy, containing maybe paprika, maybe cumin, maybe cayenne pepper. And again, the aromas and the taste of each spice were very defined. The mac and cheese that accompanied the chicken was good but the cornbread was a bit dry. This was also a very generous dish.\\n\\nWhile I was eating, I was being transported to a spice market somewhere in India, Morocco or Peru. Cask & Larder knows how to extract the aromas and flavors of the spices they use. They have simply mastered that aspect of cooking. And that is why you need to pair your food with a drink, because the drinks will only elevate your experience to the next level, whereas a soda or water will only calm your taste buds. \\n\\nFor dessert we shared a fig cobbler, it was pretty good also. I did get a clean taste of the fig, which was great. I don't know how they are able to control each flavor in such way, but basically, Cask & Larder has managed to extract the essence of every fruit or spice they use on the menu. \\n\\nIf this place keeps coming up with more and more imaginative dishes, there is no doubt it will become one of the must stops for out-of-towners. It is hard not to see why. They seem to have perfect command in the use of aromatic spices. In my eyes, they are flavor and aroma traders, and they infuse those on meats and fruits everywhere. In other words, simply genius."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Always delighted by a smooth process and high quality.

Not to mention consistently gut-busting. I consider myself as much a burger connoisseur as the next American, and I know a good burger from a mediocre one or so I like to think. And I think that Burger 21 knows how to make a satisfying and tasty burger if nothing else. \\n\\nAlright, let me break it down for you..\\n\\nBurgers:\\n\\nSo, the main feature. It's in the name so they'd better get this part right! And they have. Burger 21 offers a solid variety of different burger topping combinations on the menu in addition to having turkey burgers,  black bean burgers, and even seafood burgers so anyone should be able to find something they enjoy. \\n\\nI've eaten the Black & Bleu and the Tex-Mex Haystack and each time my burger was cooked just as I'd asked (they ask if you want it medium-well, but I like mine medium), the meat juicy and flavorful, and the ingredients all tasted fresh. The Black & Bleu comes with bacon, bleu cheese, lettuce and tomato, and is my favorite of the two. The tang of the cheese is delicious with the salty bacon and sweet tomato. I like to put BBQ sauce on it too because I'm a fiend for putting BBQ sauce on everything. \\n\\nI've also tried a bit of the Buffalo Chicken sandwich ordered by my boyfriend, and was impressed. I rarely order chicken sandwiches of any kind because I find the texture to generally be off-putting and lacking flavor, but this chicken burger was legit. A good crisp outside and juicy inside; it really made me intrigued to try their other chicken menu items.\\n\\nFries:\\n\\nI've tasted both the regular french fries and the sweet potato fries. They're decent, but nothing to write home about for me, at least. I prefer thicker fries and the portion feels a bit small, but that's the greedy, gluttonous American in me talking. They're an extra cost, but I can't imagine a burger without some fries, so I always get them anyway. There's plenty of sauces to choose from their sauce bar. I did try the toasted marshmallow sauce with the sweet potato fries as was suggested and it was a tasty combination. \\n\\nMilkshakes:\\n\\nThe next best part of the meal after the burger are the shakes. And it really is a close second. So far I've had the Creme Brulee, Chocolate Peanut Butter, and Key Lime shake and I've regretted nothing. They were all amazing and I highly recommend one if you can find the tummy room for one. Creamy and smooth made with the superb Blue Bell Ice Cream, they are pretty heavenly. The creme brulee shake was unique and quite delicious. It really did incorporate that caramelized sugar flavor, although it may be too sweet for some folks - not me ;) . The chocolate peanut butter was wonderful as well, and tasted as it should like a Reese's Cup. The Key Lime shake delivered what it promised with my favorite part being the topping of graham cracker crumbs.\\n\\nAtmosphere/Service:\\n\\nThe whole place has a nice, modern feel to it with its simplistic and sleek design. The milkshake bar area has a retro feel to it though that I enjoy. The first two times I went the place was pretty crowded since it was lunch, but the service was terrific. Really, I think this place has some of the friendliest and most attentive servers I've seen. I like the sauce bar option, although I haven't really utilized it that much. There's a hand washing station that's next to it that I think is pretty cool, although I feel a little weird standing there washing my hands next to the soda machine.\\n\\nThe last thing I'll comment on is the price. The price is not so bad, considering the food you get. I do always find it a bit irksome about these places that don't give you fries with your burger, but that's just the cheap, broke ass college student talking. The shakes are a bit pricey too with you plunking down $5 if you want something other than chocolate or vanilla. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say they're totally worth the price, but I always end up getting one anyway so who am I to talk?\\n\\nSo, to sum up this long ramble: Great burgers, great drinks, great staff, and a great experience overall. I'll certainly be back and bringing everyone along with me. Even if it doesn't end up being your favorite, I don't think you'll regret giving it a try."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The burger was delectable - and I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers. Mostly I'm picky about how it's cooked. I like it when it's medium rare. Although this burger could have been a little rarer - it was so ultra juicy and tender that I hardly noticed it's minimal pink-ness. That's probably because (as the waiter told me) they use steak and grind the meat there... that apparently makes for one delicious steak. It came with a little side salad, and it was on toast (go figure), with some mustard, mayo, and grilled onions. Yum. The price ran me $9.50 - which is a touch pricey, but I guess that that's the going rate there days for a good burger. And good it was.\\n\\nI was also eying the blueberry muffins, and scones.

You are my favorite bar ever; I moved in around the corner from you this past September, and have been seriously crushing on you ever since.  Why?  Let me count the ways:\\n\\n1. Fantastic staff. Let's face it: Rumors of a cool scene, fancy drinks, and a long beer list may lure you to a new spot, but the reason you become a regular at a bar has very little to do with the booze and almost everything to do with the bartenders. The entire staff here is great, but I'm going to focus in on the bartenders.  They're all chill, relatively friendly guys that know what they're doing.  Bar manager Joe leads the pack in being extraordinarily personable - he introduces himself to customers he doesn't know, shakes their hand, and remembers their names.  \\n\\nAlso, the male bartenders are all manly and sh*t: flannel shirts, tattoos, facial scruff...yeah.  I appreciate it.\\n\\n2. Weekly specials: Monday is Tiki Drink and Fried Chicken Night, the first Tuesday of every month is a Spelling Bee, and Wednesday is karaoke night....I could go on.  Last Wednesday was (now former) bartender Russell's last night on the bar,  and when my friends and I swung by around 10 pm to pay our respects, we could barely get in the door: the combo of a beloved HK bartender leaving  and karaoke had drawn in seemingly the whole neighborhood.

Whether you want a beer, a shot, or a schmancy cocktail, you can get your fix here.  Check the board for specialty drinks (Mark & Stormy, El Splendido, so many more).\\n\\n5. The food.  The menu is well-curated, and ranges from cheap (pulled pork sandwich, $7.95) to not so cheap (spicy goat stew, $18.95), but it's all done right and priced appropriately.

We went for dinner and were the last people to be seated because they were apparently closing (I think it was about 8pm on a Saturday night).  I gave the waiter our voucher [good for 1 app, 2 entrees, 1 desserts] and we ordered 2 drinks. He came back after a while and we ordered the food and the waiter disappeared into the kitchen. After about 15 minutes he came back with our app. We ate the whole thing and waited another 15 or so. When he finally returned, we asked about our dinks and he said, \\"Oh, I will have to go to the bar to check for those...\\" So that's over a half hour just to get our drinks! [1 beer, 1 soda]  \\n\\n   We knew things were going to be bad at this point, but they got worse. After another 30 minutes, our entrees finally came out. The waiter asked if we needed anything and we asked for: 1 plate (we had 0), 1 steak knife (I ordered the STEAK Frites) and some ketchup. 15 mins later after eating off a serving plank, and cutting with a butter knife, I had to ask some other employee (looked like a manager?) for those 3 items. You would have thought that I asked for everything listed in \\"Green Eggs and Ham.\\" She repeated what we needed 4 to 5 times to us and was still saying it as she walked into the kitchen. To her credit, she did appear relatively quickly and had all 3 correct items.\\n\\n  We finished our meal and sat for another half hour for the waiter to appear. We ordered our dessert TO GO (3 tiny desserts rather then the one large listed in the travel zoo deal, but whatever...) and gave my credit card to him right away in an attempt to speed up the process in any way possible. I feel like that helped, because it only took him 10 minutes to run my single credit card... As soon as the card a hit my table I signed it and we were out of there! \\n\\n  So it took 2.5+ hours to get an appetizer, 2 drinks, and 2 entrees. If you are thinking it was busy and we got lost in the shuffle, we were one of THREE tables! And there were 3 employees! The other 2 tables looked very angry as well.  \\n\\n  In all fairness, the atmosphere was very unique and rather interesting. I liked to cooking shows on the TV's that got your moth watering for your meal, if you are willing to wait long enough for it to make it to your table...

After last night, I won't ever go back. Ever. Nothing in the world could convince me.\\n\\nWhy? Well, let's start with how a once-exciting menu has been turned into one side of one piece of laminated paper. Basically, there's nothing to eat at this restaurant! You could get an 11 dollar bowl of noodles in broth (??), or ... one kind of curry. That's right folks: Elephant Hut doesn't actually serve curry anymore. They make one kind per day, so you're screwed if, for example, the curry of the day is yellow, and you wanted to go out and eat a delicious bowl of green curry. \\n\\nOn to the rest of the menu. When we went, the owner handed us a photocopy of the laminated menu (!?) with red sharpie crossing out everything they were out of. Which was basically everything. Again, there's no food at this restaurant. They charge you an arm and a leg to go sit in their atmosphere for an hour, I guess. And the atmosphere, admittedly, is pretty nice except for the weird TV showing the dvd menu of what looked like a recording of boat races? What?\\n\\nEven after this weirdness, my husband and I, perhaps in a fit of madness, decided to stay and eat. They did have drunken noodles and Pad Thai on the menu. They (allegedly) weren't out of that.  \\n\\nHahaha. Well, the drunken noodles were okay. Barely. The veggies weren't particularly fresh and the sauce was too salty. But it was five-star gourmet cuisine compared to my Pad Thai. My dish of Pad Thai was an insult to Pad Thai. Pad Thai is not a greasy plate of noodles and mushy tofu with two tablespoons of chopped peanuts on the side. There was no garnish--no bean sprouts, no green onions, not a single leaf of cilantro. There wasn't even a slice of lime on the side. That's not Pad Thai: That is what college kids make when they're hard up for cash. Rice noodles are maybe a dollar at any Asian market; half a block of tofu runs you 75 cents. So how, HOW can any place in good faith charge someone 11 dollars for noodles and tofu? Unless they secretly make their Pad Thai sauce with gold leaf, this pricing is beyond insane. \\n\\nIt was our anniversary, so my husband and I thought we'd treat ourselves to a fancy meal. Well, fool me once, shame on you, Elephant Hut. It shan't happen again.

It has a purposefully made rustic look and serves up a good cup of coffee... actually, it's a darn fine cup of coffee. With being on Main street, there is plenty of action and opportunities to people watch and/or enjoy the sights and sounds of the area.  Additionally, you'll be able to get fresh hand-made donuts due Lucky's donuts being part of this location. However, be warned, you will be subjected to a slew of hipsters and donuts which are simply ok making them severely overpriced.\\n\\nAs far as coffee goes, I find the roasts at the 49th Parallel are pretty great. I personally find it to be one of my favourite coffees you can find in Vancouver, and perhaps one of the top coffees I have had (and I lived in San Francisco for 2 years where they take their coffee very seriously).  The 49th Parallel roasts their beans locally after traveling the world to the farms regions where they get their beans from. This may sound unnecessary and a little extravagant, but the selective choosing the owners and master roaster have made with the beans, make for a great cup of coffee.  With this said, you can grab a drip or espresso based coffee and hang out in the rustic designed location, take a cup to go on your way, or pick up a bag of beans ready to be ground and enjoyed at home. The coffee prices are standard for a coffee shop ranging from about $2 to $5 depending on the size and type of coffee (i.e. small drip coffee vs. large extra foam vanilla latte).\\n\\nOne item that impressed me about this location was, on my first visit, there was a long line of about 15 people; however, in less than 3 minutes, and I was ordering my coffee and donuts.  Even more impressive, less than 2 minutes later I had my coffee in hand. One may think they have given me another person's drink, and I would have thought that too, but I saw them make my latte and call my name as they were passing the cup over to the counter.  The efficiency of the barista's was certainly welcomed. All the times I have been to the 49th Parallel so far, the cashiers and baristas have been consistently quick and the drinks have all be made/poured/mixed wonderfully.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the items that enticed me to visit this location was Lucky's hand-made donuts is also on site.  Lucky's hook is they make fresh hand-made donuts on-site with standard and \\"premium\\" flavours such as bacon-apple fritter, salted caramel, dark cocoa, peanut butter and jelly, and others.  The donuts are fresh and use natural ingredients, making them better than a chain or \\"big-box\\" store donuts.  However, I wouldn't say the donuts were phenomenal, which I found disappointing.  Part of my negative attitude towards the donuts may stem from each donut being $2 to $4 each.  That's right... each!  A plain glazed donut will cost you $2, while something with filling or a fritter will set you back $3.50 to $4.  I do realize the donuts are fresh and made in-house, but it really should be a great donut to warrant such a hefty price.  With other hand-made shops such as Lee's Donuts on Granville Island or Duffin's Donuts on the corner of 41st and Knight, where you can get a dozen donuts for ~$12 and ~$8 respectfully, it seems out of place for charging $12 for 3 or 4 donuts.  With that said, every time I've gone, people are buying the donuts like there were going out of style and the bakers are continuously working to get more fresh donuts out. It will be interesting to see if this trend lasts as the store becomes more established.\\n\\nAlthough I really like the coffee, the expertise of the baristas, the friendliness of all the staff and the actual look of the 49th Parallel, I have been left a little let down at how crowded it can get.  Yes, it is a coffee shop with good coffee and good baristas, so it will pull in the coffee aficionados.  However, even with lots of space, almost every time I've gone all the tables are filled with people on their Macbooks, working on sketches, writing something in a notebook, or in a larger group having a chat. This wouldn't be so bad, but twice I've been told they were holding 2 or 3 empty chairs since they were having friends coming or it's a good place to hold their bags.  This is by no means the fault of the 49th Parallel, but the it is something to consider if you're planning on going for a cup of coffee and want to have a chat with someone.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the 49th parallel serves a great cup of coffee. But, the high price for ok donuts and seating which can be a bit hard to find, I would recommend to stop in and grab a cup to go.  3.5 stars"},{"name":"Olive Branch","address":"115 W 3rd Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"We've been here 3-4 times and it's always been a pleasant experience.

One thing we did not enjoy was the service. The server did make a great effort to recommend items from the menu and was attentive. He also didn't let us go before he recommended some upcoming shows, which was a nice touch. However, other staff showed no accommodation to us. For example, we booked a table for 2, and noted in the reservation that 2 more people will be joining us for drinks once we finished dinner. Since it was a mid-week night, the place was half empty and there were plenty of tables for 4 open. Strict to their guidelines though, were told only diners can sit and therefore we will have to get up once we finished dinner and wanted to have drinks with our friends. Wrong approach. Also- when my friend (who happens to be particular about wine, since she works in the upscale restaurant industry for years) asked to taste a couple of wines before she chooses, she was told they bring out no tastings. Wrong approach again.

As a quick aside, if you haven't had a chance to go to any of the sister restaurants (Arro, Italic or 24 Diner), you should check them out as they are all absolutely amazing. The overall feel of Easy Tiger is casual yet quality. You shouldn't be afraid to show up as you are, but you should expect amazing food and a fantastic, ever changing beer selection. \\n\\nSECRET:\\nSo Easy Tiger has this thing called the Mug Club. Idea is, you give them some money, and they give you a Mug Club card, an awesome Easy Tiger mug and a T-shirt. Now, every time you show up, you hand them your Mug Club card and all your beers are upgraded to huge mug beers for the same price! Even if you are only going to come a handful of times, the club quickly pays for itself, and that is without considering the value of the stylin' shirt and mug.\\n\\nFood (4.5):\\nEasy Tiger's food is consistently awesome. The beer cheese (I know it sounds weird) is a must order, paired with a fresh made pretzel from the bakery upstairs. I have become particularly partial to their beef sausage served with stone ground mustard in a pretzel bun, but Juliet can't bring herself to stop ordering the pastrami sandwich. I can safely say that I have never ordered something that I didn't like.\\n\\nDrink (5.0):\\nIn my opinion, Easy Tiger has one of the most interesting tap lists in the city. Not only do they always have fun, small run craft brews, but their tap list is constantly rolling over, so no matter how often you show up, there will likely be something new to try. I would like to be able to give some information about their spirit or wine selections, but I have yet to show up and not see a beer that I really want to try instead haha. \\n\\nService (4.5):\\nUnlike a lot of other places I review, Easy Tiger is a casual, and yet chaotic atmosphere, so my usual qualities for this category are a bit useless. What I will say, is everyone is always super nice, amazingly knowledgeable and willing to bend over backwards to make sure you have the best time possible."},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We are always craving Texas BBQ, so we try to stop by 4 Rivers when we can.

I was just going to leave but she said that we could eat in the bar. We got to the bar and found a table immediately. I am not old, but this place made me feel that way with the extremely loud games on. Everyone in the bar was yelling over one another. When someone is sitting 2 feet away from you, you shouldn't have to yell so loud to hold a conversation that you leave with a sore throat. Our server came immediately to us, took our drink and appetizer order. The waiter was really helpful in guiding me in what was too hot and not. Everything came pretty quickly. The reason for only 2 stars is that the food was so salty (and I mean everything... we had the tailgating sampler, a black and bleu cheese burger, and grilled chicken buffalitos) that most of it was inedible. Even the bacon was coated in salt. I give the stars for the service, but I won't be back.

Parking is for PCM is in the lot to the right of the building when facing it from Ponce, in the internal courtyard (good luck there) or in the underground deck. Parking is fairly expensive and really unwarranted - my biggest complaint of PCM - with a very tight and messed-up parking deck to boot. You may be better off parking somewhere it's free to park and walking to the market.\\n\\nI met some of my Yelper friend's at Ponce City Market to sample some of the restaurants' offerings - this was hosted by Tuong Vi P (https://www.yelp.com/events/atlanta-uye-lets-do-saturday-lunch-ponce-city-market) - the idea is that we would all order a few items and meat to dine together. I went with Praveen R and Miles and hit Hop's Chicken - this is a \\"bucket of chicken\\" place that offers up homemade sides and \\"Nashville style Hot Chicken.\\" We also sampled the double-burger from H&F and a few other items and sat together at one of the long-tall tables upstairs.\\n\\nHop's Chicken is a fast-casual chicken stand where you order at the counter and when your food is ready they call out. The primary menu is a board to the right of the ordering window - they have a simple menu that's pretty much chicken cut-up into pieces, biscuits, a few sides and sauces. They also serve some local craft beer which always makes things better. I enjoyed a can of Terrapin Hi-5 while waiting for my food to arrive.\\n\\nThe food is served in paper containers bagged in a cute Hop's Chicken bag. We wanted to try the Nashville style Hot Chicken so ordered a whole chicken - and were told it would be about 20 minutes. It was actually more like 30-45 - it took quite a long time to get our bucket and yes, served in a white bucket much like the classic KFC. For sides we ordered the Mac&Cheese, Cole Slaw and Limas&Corn (some type of succotash wantabee).\\n\\nThe verdict - the chicken was a bit soggy from the \\"hot\\" application and I must say that it wasn't quite what you would get in one of the classic Nashville locations. That being said, it was still quite tasty if a bit greasy. Just good spicy fried chicken (a bit more like a hot chicken wing with breading). The sides were all so-so and could use some pumping up, but the star of this show is the chicken. While I didn't think it was true \\"Nashville Hot\\" it was still good in it's own right - I give it 4 stars. I think it will taste terrific on a biscuit and I hope they offer it up that way (wasn't offered at this date). I do think that the wait was unreasonable, the price a bit expensive and the sides mediocre so cranking down my rating to 3/5 stars.\\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite spots !!!!!

The calamari was cooked just right and the breading was crispy and not too greasy.  My fiance (now hubby!) ordered the Pork Rosemarino entree for dinner\\n(Tenderloin medallions coated in Dijon mustard and rosemary infused breadcrumbs saut√©ed and topped with an herb and roasted red pepper sauce) and I opted for the Lobster Ravioli.  The servings are pretty generous, but  I finished every bite of my ravioli because it was divine.

I loved the shiitake mushrooms, which complemented the lobster filling well and that way I didn't have to choose between Mushroom or Lobster Ravioli.
