Come back once you've secured your spot. \\n\\nThis place was amazing. The food was incredible first of all, but for the quality of the meal you're going to have, you can't beat the cost. Tons of generic, mediocre steakhouses will run you twice the bill you'll spend here for food that's kind of revelatory.\\n\\nI'm going to talk about the reservation system as I understand it via experience. So apparently there's only one a night, at the very beginning of the dinner seating, for groups of 8 or more. We booked ours for 12 on a weeknight about 3 weeks ahead I want to say? And they treated us so kindly. Now as far as I know there are no brunch reservations, and I hear brunch is the big attraction here, but do not feel like you're getting shortchanged taking the dinner experience. It seems easier to get in for dinner, and it's still such good food. \\n\\nThey serve the food--or at least the sides/appetizers?--in a kind of nebulously explained family style? I'm still not really sure how it was different than normal? Basically the sides are big enough for sharing, and everyone gets a \\"Can we get an extra plate to share\\" dish without asking. I didn't really get how it was different but it worked just fine anyway. We shared literally everything we ordered around the table--the sides equally and everyone got a taste of all the individual entrees--and we all left plenty full. The wait staff will tell you that some of the entrees are big enough for sharing, but check to make sure before you count on it. The pork chop is basically the size of a human face but there are some pretty small cuts of steak. \\n\\nI'm sure part of the reason the lines get so long is how small this place is but the size makes for a much more pleasant dining experience. No one's bumping into your chair walking by or getting up, and it's a very pleasant volume--still quiet enough to talk which I appreciated. It's a kind of intimate space, and between the size of the room and the open kitchen you kind of feel like you're at a friend's house mixed with a summer camp? Weird comparison but that's where I ended up. The friend's house thing may also have something to do with how nice our waitress was. She seemed happy to have us, and not in a hope-I-get-a-big-tip way. \\n\\nReally, don't hesitate. Just go.

As we entered, our eyes immediately went to the glass display case where large selection of cheeses were on display; they made we feel like we were in one of the little local cheese shops in Europe.  Behind the Cheese Bar was the owner, Steve Jones.  In addition to large selection of gourmet cheeses, the Cheese Bar has sizable selection of bottled beers and domestic/imported wine by glasses or bottles.  \\n\\nAs we sat down the owner came by our table with menus.  We ordered the surprise cheese board and cold meat board of the day for $9.50 each to share among the five of us.  We also had dessert and wine by the glasses.  The cheese board came with four different type of cheeses and a small dish of fruit relish.  I was very surprised by the sizable of cheese slices we got for $9.50, imported blue cheese, dutch cheese, gouda and Gruyere.  The meat board came with three different type of imported cold meats, slices of salame, thinly slices of Prosciutto and slices of capocollo and a small dish of pickled vegetable: cauliflower, red pepper, onion...The owner took great pride in explaining to us where the cheeses and meat came from, their ingredients, their names and how they were made.  He also suggested wines to pair with the cheeses and cold meats; the imported white wine was more sour than the Oregon's white wine; however, it was great when pairing with the cheeses.  Between the meat board and cheese board, I enjoyed the cheese board more and thought it was better bargain of the two.  I even had a little left over of the cheeses to take home.  We had two small sliced crusty french baguettes with our cheeses and cold meats.   The baguettes were fresh and crusty.  They were good compliment with the cheeses and cold meats.  We had cheese cake and bread putting for dessert.  The cheese cake was individual baked portion.  It was good but on the dry side.  \\n\\nOur experience at Cheese Bar was very good.  We learned and had different type of imported cheeses, cold meats and wines.  The type of cheeses and meats we had are not offered widely, probably only in specialty cheese and cold meat shops online, and only for ordering large quantity.   We are very lucky to have such unique cheese bar in Portland and especially so close to where I live.  At the Cheese Bar,  we can get small portion of cheeses to go and try out different type of cheeses and cold meats from the daily cheese and cold meat boards and enjoy them in an intimate, casual and relaxing environment.

The sauce that came with it is unnecessary bc friend plantains are so good! The goulash on sp√§tzle was good.\\n\\nThe real star of the show though is the chicken paprikash. Great flavor. Tender chicken. Delicious sp√§tzle- the most authentic I've seen in a restaurant.

A tiny piece of breaded chicken hiding inside a soft roll that was closer to a roll at Subway than what your mind conjures up when you hear the word \\"baguette\\" - Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and TASTY.  What we had served to us instead was a soft roll that came out of a bag.  No attempt to warm it or toast it.

Can we get the rest of the menu to follow suit??\\n\\nFunny, another reviewer that visited the same day, also thought the biscuits were bad.  Maybe it was an off day?

They also offer dim sum, but my group was not really in the mood, since we usually prefer the larger Chinese restaurants that specialize in it or Winsor Dim Sum Cafe. \\n\\nI got the Beef Rendang, and I thought the beef was a little rough and not amazing, but somewhat tasty. Sauce was also okay, and tasted good with the rice and the cold cucumbers that came with it. The presentation was good, but that was about it. Overall, I would say it was a decent meal, but more like decent as in adequate.  \\n\\nOne person in my party ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice and she was willing to share some in my party. I had a few pieces of chicken, and I thought the meat was tasty, but bony. While the presentation of the dish looks good, it did not look something that I would order if I was really hungry mainly because the portions look meager to my eyes. \\n\\nAnother person in my party ordered the Beef Fried Rice. She could not finish it, so I helped her out. I thought it was the tastiest dish out of the three, and it appeared to be the most filling. Beef strips were flavorful, nice and chewy, but the rice was just okay. \\n\\nThe decor and interior was really nice, with large windows, so it's probably not a bad choice to do a little people-watching on Beach Street in Chinatown if you are into that sort of thing. Another decent advantage is that place had a couple of flat screen TVs. We were able to catch a 2010 World Cup match featuring England vs. Germany live, which of course, looked awesome (minus the disallowed English Frank Lampard goal). Service was somewhat decent, we got our food in about 15 minutes. \\n\\nOverall, the restaurant is at a good location with a nice interior, and it's not a bad choice to get some okay Malaysian Chinese food, but I prefer to go to Penang if I am really in the mood for it."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"One of the best brunches I have ever eaten.

Best pizza in town, and I'm not just talking about Arlington (that would be too easy).

The onion sauce on the 'forager' is especially tasty, and a great change of pace from other 'white' pizzas out there. I'm also a big fan of the beet salad - very flavorful, nice complement to pizza with the lemony dressing, and a decent portion-size too, share this and a pizza and you have a perfect meal for two. \\n\\nI'll also recommend the chocolate croissants.

We were there recently with a party of 4 (including a 3 year old). There weren't any 4 tops open when we arrived, but the waitress / hostess let us know that some folks at a 2 top were finishing up, and that we could have their table and the adjacent empty 2 top when they were done. They put a little reserved sign on the adjacent 2 top. And, so, rather than hover over these tables we went outside to wait. So, eventually those folks finish eating and leave and we're still outside waiting for the table to be cleared off. Meanwhile another group has come in and wants to sit at the now-vacated table. We go inside and say to them, \\"we've been waiting outside for these tables before you came along.\\" Other group says \\"but it's first come first served\\", which would seem to support our claim to the tables, but the look on the other guy's face makes me worried that I'm now in the ridiculous situation of having to put down my 3 year old to defend myself in a pizza restaurant. In any case it sounds like there was some miscommunication between the staff and this other group about the availability of the tables. They may not have seen us waiting outside. The waitress / hostess comes over to defuse and confirms we were there first, and the other group leaves in a huff. I think the staff handled the situation with a great deal of tact and aplomb. Our meal was excellent.\\n\\nIn the other group's defense, this really is pizza worth fighting for. I'd encourage them to give Commune Kitchen another try and not let this one experience mean they never get to eat such amazing food. \\n\\nDear Commune Kitchen, please keep doing what you do. \\n\\nlove, \\nAdam"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is yummy and a lot of fun.

That is precisely what happened.  There was one lil ole Christmas tree lollipop left, and it was placed in the trembling paw of my child.  Oh happy day!  (For her).  And as it turns out, I'm not the devil- I let her indulge.  I opened it and half of the thing crumbled onto the table, so I gave her what was left and clinging to the stick.  It smelled like... minty death barf.  But whatever, have at it, kid.  And she did.  She calmly devoured this hard candy piece of gross until... SNAP!

I ordered take-out last month, and parts of my order were missing, and the food I received was not great. I emailed the restaurant to explain the specific issues, and they responded (after a couple attempts at contacting) with an apology and a gift card. \\n\\nMy wife and I returned this weekend for a late afternoon lunch around 2pm, when the restaurant was mostly empty. We ordered two pulled chicken plates and a side of cole slaw. Our newborn baby was with us, so we were in a hurry to eat quickly, so we did not say anything when the two pulled pork plates arrived. We also did not want to waste the food that had been brought to us in error. We were one of the only people dining in the restaurant at the time, and we ordered the identical plates, so there is no excuse for bringing the wrong food, especially because we were visiting to make up for a prior wrong order. \\n\\nWhen leaving, we asked to bring our leftovers in to-go packaging, and instead of packaging the food for us, the waiter/bartender left us with a couple containers, which took us a while to pack cleanly and eventually got grease and sauce all over the place. I needed to wash my hands before leaving, but in the bathroom, after letting the hot water run for over 2 minutes, the sink still had no hot water, and I assume this is a health code violation if the cooks and waitstaff are washing in the same sinks? \\n\\nI understand and accept the occasional misstep, but this appears to be the norm based on my last couple experiences. The review gets 3 stars because the food is still decent and the prices make it one of the best bargains in town, if you can get past the inattentive service.\\n\\nFollow-Up: Management again reached out and expressed concern and apology for our experience, and they invited us back to the restaurant for an improved experience. Updated rating to 4-stars for proactively addressing our experience."},{"name":"Mantra Restaurant","address":"52 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Much better than the current average rating would suggest--though that's largely due to the fact that Mantra as a restaurant is far different from Mantra as a nightclub.\\n\\nWent with the girlfriend using a Groupon (paid $20 for $50 in food) on a Friday night. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, and was perfectly attentive (we didn't have to wait around forever for her, and she didn't hover over us). The ambiance is great, and although the tables are all right in the middle of an open space, we never felt awkward or self-conscious. There was just enough separation for comfortable conversation with the noise of other tables and music from the overhead speakers.\\n\\nOne IMPORTANT note: Mantra has two menus. One is a \\"traditional\\" Indian menu (which, as some have noted, is generally cheaper), and the other is the Indian-French fusion menu. This isn't something that's immediately obvious--they hand you the fusion menu when you sit down, while the Indian menu is already on the table in a plastic casing.\\n\\nWe ordered the naan trio and chutney from the fusion menu, and pistachio shake, duck jhalfrezi, and thali combination dinner from the Indian menu. Everything was delicious, but the roasted garlic and spinach naan, garlic and green onion chutney, and pistachio shake really stood out. The thali combination dinner was a surprisingly good deal, and very well prepared--it included a samosa, lentil soup, coffee/tea (or latte/espresso/cappuccino), poori and rice, raita, small portions of malai kofta and some other vegetable curry-type dish, and a choice of three desserts (kheer, rasmalai, or gulab jamun) for ~$20.\\n\\nThe prices are a little steep, but not completely unreasonable (roughly $68 for a LOT of food before discount, tax, etc.). The place itself is pretty nice, and the service was great. The only thing holding me back from a higer rating is the fact that a number of somewhat upscale Indian restaurants (notably The Kebab Factory in Somerville) provide experiences of similar caliber for lower prices.\\n\\nCaveat: we did not order appetizers aside from the naan, and we ordered our entrees off of the traditional Indian menu. Their appetizers and fusion dishes all sounded fantastic, and we'll be sure to try them if/when we make another trip.\\n\\nOh, and by the way--the men's bathroom is truly an experience unto itself. I highly recommend checking it out."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool place, I've been here before by chance before knowing anything about how famous it is.

It was packed but for such a circumstance, they were pretty quick with preparing the food and the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered the malai kofta while my boyfriend ordered the kadahi lamb. The portions were fairly sized and decent. The quality of the food is amazing and can be compared to Clay Pit with the advantage that NOTHING on the menu is more than $9.99.

The low-lit bar area features a fairly small bar ringed with a number of small banquettes bordering the windows. The bar menu features a number of beverages and a small number of food options.

I've been to the Antico by Georgia Tech a few times but this was my first visit to this new outpost.\\n\\nIntroduced some friends to Antico too, and they seemed really content with their pizza. They shared the Margherita DOP ($20). Antico doesn't allow changes to the preselected pie toppings, but they do allow you to add toppings to this particular pizza. \\n\\nTwo of us split the San Gennaro ($22). It's probably my fave, and I'm a fan of the red/rosso pizzas just a hair more than the white/bianche pizzas. The San Gennaro comes with sausage, sweet red peppers, little onions, and bufala mozzarella. The crust is thin and comes slightly burnt.\\n\\nThe cashier was on the surly side and seemed really impatient as I fumbled for my wallet. He should lighten up. The runners who brought over the pizzas seemed less grumpy at least. Water is available off to the side, on a table with additional accoutrements (olive oil, peppers, garlic, and so on). Nab spots at a communal table. Memorize your order number and listen carefully for it over the din. \\n\\nAntico stays open later if there are events going on. They were closing up shop around 11 PM. I was worried initially, but they also seem to have more dough on hand. If you've ever gone to the GT location later in the evening, you definitely run the risk of being pizza-less.

Maybe the 'responder' is not in the human resources department.\\n\\nAnywho, fun to read none-the-less.  I actually thought the service was stellar, but it was lunch and I think my waitress didn't have any other tables so makes it tough to have any long delays there, right?  (I think her name was Magadalena if you want to give her employee of the month).   Odd thing was there were about 5 tables of guests in there and everyone had a different server.  Perhaps the rush was 'right around the corner'.  The waitress at the table next to me was quite enthusiastic.  She starts ripping off the 'daily specials' ... not the specials of the day, mind you, but the two dollar tacos on Viernes (come on people, learn your days of the week), mimosas on the weekend type of specials.  She must have went on over a minute firing these things off.  I looked at the two dudes she was 'Boiler Room'ing this towards and I'm pretty sure they didn't remember a one of them when she was done by the looks on their faces.  She certainly was passionate though (tell me you don't like my %^&*ing necktie, but don't tell me you can't piece together 20 bucks for some magarita specials!!!).\\n\\nWhen the five servers weren't at their particular table, they were all sitting at one table having lunch.  Apparently Willie Degel from Restaurant Stakeout on the Food Network hasn't stopped by Garrido's yet.  I'm pretty sure he was ripping one restaurant manager a new one for this very thing.  Maybe they'll replay that episode at some point ...\\n\\nI started off with the Shrimp Cocktail Acapulco.  Avocado, cucumber, and cilantro are teaming up with the shrimp for this one.  Since I don't have time to drive the 1167 miles from Garrido's to Acapulco, I'll take their word on it that this is the style.  Yes, I'll wait a few seconds while you type that into the google maps to see if that's the actual mileage.  Yes, I am prone to hyperbole every now and then to bolster a point, but I actually did the leg work on that 1167.  Also, most of the recipes on the internet seem to back up the ingredients here (quick side note -- you know how I love my side stories -- go check out any recipe site and read the comments below on any recipe -- how come EVERY SINGLE PERSON changes something about the recipe?  Cracks me up!)  On top of this cocktail, there's a big meaty shrimp and I'm thinking looks like the leadoff man is getting on base.  That's a fine start to this meal.  As you know from my review on Turf and Surf Po Boy, I dig me some big shrimp!  Unfortunately all the shrimp under the top one was cut up.  Pretty tasty all in all until I got to the bottom where the cilantro was.  I seriously could not tell if it was cilantro or lettuce as it tasted like neither and was a good day or two passed 'feeding it to the dogs' stage.  I realize it must be difficult in ordering food from the vendors and keeping everything fresh, but that's not my problem :)  .  That cilantro was OLD.\\n\\nI ordered the Coffee Marinated Steak Taco plate (as it sounded delicious and more tasty than steak marinated coffee).  I call bull$%^& on this one.  Couldn't taste even a hint of coffee on it.  Maybe the cook was drinking coffee when he put the dish together.  I know, I know, the 'responder' is going to come on here and tell me those tacos are imported from the backyard of Juan Valdez himself!  I actually can't remember anything about the beans, but the rice was my least favorite in the history of cuisine in my lifetime.  I am pretty darn lenient on rice (as long as the doneness is in the ballpark), and I honestly can't remember the last time I thought, 'wow, I'm actually not going to take the rest of this rice with me'.  It tasted like a chicken bouillon cube was dissolved in lemon-lime gatorade and then poured over the rice.  I apologize if I posted the actual secret recipe on the internet.\\n\\nWould I go again?

And before you judge me for my decision to use restaurants like this to impress ladies, let me point out that when it comes to assuring one's date has a good time, a man must use every trick in his arsenal.

Honestly, this is one of my first few times eating Indian food, but I really enjoyed it. The tomato and potato really came out, and the spice level was spot on. (For me, the spiceness was about medium - not overpowering and really enjoyable.) The lamb was tender, and the dish was pretty flavorful overall. I tried my friend's chicken tikki masala, and it was nice and creamy, acting as a great accompaniment to the vindaloo. \\n\\nYour order comes with one cup of rice and one cup of your entree - it looks a little small, but it's fairly filling. If you're coming with a group, I'd suggest splitting the entrees and ordering naan - it's pretty tasty and will help fill you up. (It also acts as a mop to clean out your entree bowl!) You should also consider getting a Teji's special - it's take-out only, but it looks so worth the money. \\n\\nI'm definitely coming back, and I'm looking forward to it. The staff are friendly, but I'm hoping to service will improve as they acclimate to the amount of business they're getting. I expect it to improve, but the waitstaff were definitely stretched thin and the food took some time to come out (over 25-30 minutes); however, it's totally worth a shot right now.

After hearing chatter of Redbones around town and wading through the 1,300 plus reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try.  As an appetizer we ordered the BUFFALO SCRIMP w/ BLUE CHEESE.  Although the order was small (7 scrimp i believe) they were crispy, packed with flavor and delicious.  For the main course I ordered the PULLED PORK SANDWICH, 1/4 BABY BACK RACK, POTATO SALAD, and FRENCH FRIES.  My accomplice Shannon went with the BRISKET SANDWICH, MASHED POTATOES, and MAC AND CHEESE.  We bit in, looked each other in the eye, and gave a single direct off axis head nod.

No regrets! \\n\\nThe Juggernaut Waffle is exactly as they advertised, and the combination of ingredients really enhanced the flavor. Plus, the fried chicken piece is huge! And perfectly crispy! The red waffle was also adorable, and just the right fluffiness. \\n\\nThe OG Pancake Platter is a great option, especially for first-timers, because it lets you try all four types of pancakes, and each pancake is pretty much a standard size of pancake order, but you pay less than $3 more than for any single order of pancake! Moreover, each pancake order was just an explosion of deliciousness, especially the Red Velvet Pancake. I was skeptical of the cream cheese topping, but it ended up really adding to the dish. The Apple Caramel Pancake, despite sounding fairly ordinary, was actually much tastier than expected and probably my second favorite of the four. The Baked Alaskan Banana Pudding Pancake was pretty solid (exactly what you'd expect), and the Reese Cup Pancake is an overload of peanut butter flavor. When they say peanut butter layered between each cake, they basically mean they added a pancake-thick layer of peanut butter between each pancake. I ended up having to scrape off some of the peanut butter because it was just too much for me, but I'm also not a huge fan of peanut butter, so take that with a grain of salt. \\n\\nCan't wait to come back!"},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a really cool little food truck thing located in the backyard of the vortex bar.

They have been extremely offensive and paid no heed to our concerns.\\n\\nMy friend ordered Chicken Tikka Masala after falling in love with it from her first experience at Teji's. She ordered it to eat in the restaurant and was asked 2 times \\"here or to go?\\" And properly replied both times she was eating in the restaurant. However, the waiter returned with not only her food in a to-go bag, but also with the WRONG ORDER. \\n\\nBeing Indian myself, I personally know the difference between Chicken Tikka Masala and her order, and she most definitely received Butter Chicken instead. I have tried both of these dishes multiple times at Teji's as a dedicated customer, so I know it was the wrong order. \\n\\nI went back to the cashier (who is also supposedly the manager) and expressed my concern that we received the wrong order. I did not even make any comment that they gave us a to-go box. However, the cashier completely disregarded my comment and did not even taste or check if our dish was incorrect. He just said that there should have been no mistake with our order. \\n\\nBeing the respectful person I am, I did not wish to further push the subject so we ate our meal as-is. However, another friend joined us afterwards and also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala.\\n\\nI was curious as to whether or not our order and my friend's tasted the same. When her order arrived, not only was her dish a different color, it indeed tasted different! \\n\\nAlthough our dish was already finished, I still only wished to express to the cashier that our order was indeed incorrect, and a simple apology would have sufficed. However, the cashier responded indignantly that they were not wrong, as to even question my own taste as an Indian. I asked if there was anything he could do, but he replied that we had already eaten the dish. I responded that of course we know we already ate the dish, but we had come up to him previously stating the dish was incorrect. \\n\\nThe cashier paid no heed, saying that he does not provide refunds and we left a bit frustrated.\\n\\nI apologize for this long statement, but I would ultimately just wish to express that the customer service I received today was HORRIBLE. It is common courtesy that if a customer says a dish is incorrect, that the customer is correct. However, he did not even try to check if our dish was different. \\n\\nI am angry with the way I was treated today, and I would never come back again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT  ANYONE COME  TO TEJI'S IF THEY WISH TO BE TREATED LIKE AN ACTUAL CUSTOMER.

But since I love garridos so much I tried to go again last Friday.  Showed up at 6:30, pretty early for a Friday I think, but again was quoted a 2 hour wait time.  Why? Because they were accommodating a party of around 56 so had to save every table in the main dining room for it.  Now that is just poor management.

It was crazy to be met with such a disrespectful, unaware, and unconcerned service that we will not be ever coming back. We then looked on google to see if there were nuts and received that most masala and curries have nuts. So clearly their assistant manager doesn't know anything!!! And was rude and inconsiderate when dealing with a question about a food allergy which could've caused a drastic effect to my friend who had to leave immediately and receive medical treatment."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Just want to give a quick review for Joey D's.

Some of the reason I like it:\\n- I can find 98% of the brands I like\\n- Although always packed, it's always clean\\n- It can be a \\"one time\\" shopping stop: groceries, large seafood section, butcher, liquor, \\"house items\\", prepared meals, eat-in food section, etc.\\n- Their employees understand customer service, and are always happy to help.\\n\\nThings I dislike:\\n- Their organic section is limited, and EXTREMELY, ridiculously expensive. To give you an example: organic bell peppers cost $3.79 each. Market Basket sells them at $2.99/lb! At Wegmans, 3 bell peppers would cost me approx. $11.37 vs. $5.38 at Market Basket\\n- Their produce aisles seem chaotic. They're not well organized. Even Market Basket, which has less space than Wegmans, has less chaos happening in that section\\n\\nDespite the things I dislike, I still shop at Wegmans because I can find almost everything there, and it eliminates me having to go to different stores looking for the brands I like."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"39 John F Kennedy St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Honestly, I probably eat here more often than I should be.

Never had anything like it, and you never will unless you go to Thailand.  The chicken is really good, love the lemon and dill broth, the flavors are phenomenal and very smooth, I get it all the time.  \\n\\nThe Pad Kapow is a real hit, another go-to dish of mine, so flavorful and fresh.  I love the pork mixed with the rice and just the right seasoning, there's cukes in there along with a fried egg that really mixes well and hits the spot and cleanses your palate.  It's also a unique dish and like nothing you've ever had, I can't get enough of that Pad Kapow.  I do have their Thai Tea on occasion which I find to be very robust and flavorful - I highly recommend. \\n\\nMoo Ping - oh my - so damn tasty.  I can't get just 2, gotta get four of these tasty BBQ skewers of marinated meat.  Wonderful food on the go.  The Mango with Sticky Rice absolutely ROCKS!  I love this dessert! They give you tons of mango slices, very fresh, and there's sweet coconut milk layered all over and it's on a bed of sticky rice.  So fresh, so quality good.  I would call it a very refreshing and tasty dessert.  I've had the Laab Moo too - it's very good, lots veggies, but very spicy.  It's so good that I make myself deal with it.  The Tofu Stir Fry which is next on my list as it gets lots of rave reviews.  \\n\\nBut what keeps me coming back here is really simple - - the couple that owns this trailer are first class and extremely nice.  They are eager to please and are always accommodating no matter how busy they get.  The consistency and execution here is flawless - - I always get the same quality and quantity no matter what time of the day, it's always fresh and tastes great.  There are no inconsistencies here, no issues, no breakdowns - - they've got a good thing going here and they do a great job running this trailer.

Hanover Street seems to be teeming with Italian cuisine and we already had our taste of that. We still wanted seafood and have yet to try a good lobster roll. So, our guide recommended Neptune Oyster. We were told that the place is small and if we had not made any reservation, chances are we will be waiting for a table from 2 to 3 hours. Boy, he was to kidding! We came at around 600 PM and the place was already packed. There was already a list going and the wait was for 3 hours. We still put in our name, thinking that most would cancel. We went around the neighborhood and in 1-1/2 hours we already got a call for our table. There was only my cousin and myself and we shared a table with 5 other ladies. That is how small the place is and if you're particular with your personal space, this is not a place for you. They have a special every day and for that day, it was soft shell crab. It was about 745 PM when we got seated and by that the time, they were already out of the special. We got the lobster roll and the spanish octopus salad, instead. We were not disappointed. The octopus was tender and the hazelnut romesco sauce took the fishy smell and taste away. It was light and perfect for a late night meal. The lobster roll, on the other hand, was served plain in a toasted roll, with a generous portion of french fries. It was cooked just right and was also tender. Without any dressing such as mayonnaise, one can easily taste the sweet and salty flavor of the lobster. I'd say it was worth the wait! They also serve this burger that is topped with fried oysters. We could have tried that but reserved that for our next trip."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is very good, a little bit pricey.\\n\\nOne star for the waiting, you need to prepare for at least two hours."},{"name":"Tommy Want Wingy","address":"94 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wings are the bomb!

The garlic bread has a lot of oil on it but flavor is really good. Surprisingly the salad was my favorite. The cannolis were chocolate covered which were okay.

Seriously who made the decision that the classic lobster roll should be cold and smothered in mayo! That was the OLD GENERATION OF LOBSTER ROLLS in the golden age of mayo. Mayo is out, aioli is in. In this case Neptune keeps it simple and classic with butter. \\nThe lobster roll was stuffed to the brim with lobster on a toasted roll that was somewhat like a thick slice of grilled bread (made a tad soggy by butter). It was notable in the quality of lobster and the quantity BUT not in the uniqueness of flavor or inventiveness of translation or skill of the chef. There is seriously nothing special about this lobster roll- someone extracted the lobster meat after boiling the lobster and drenched it in butter and (maybe?) put it through one more quick heat round. That's not to say it wasn't delicious, it was! Completely! But if you're going to wait in line for a crazy amount of time my advice would to be get something singular and intricate. I could easily make that lobster roll at home, you know, if I felt like boiling a lobster and extracting all the meat, which I guess I don't...\\n\\nAnd the fries! Delicious! They reminded me of beach fries... like thrashers (Maryland peeps out there?) or a better version of five guys fries.

Several minutes later I finally got a call from the manager. After some discussion, he contacted UberEats and we had a phone conversation with them to figure out the best way to resolve the issues. Terrel, the manager, thought I hung up the phone when he proceeded to tell the UberEats representative that he has 3 people working, and though the customer has to be right, it's highly unlikely I was telling the truth about my order being messed up twice.

Just honest food that is accurately described on the menu, and prepared correctly every time. I have never once detected a lack of freshness. The food comes out quick, but not \\"this has been waiting for you to order it all day\\" quick, if ya dig.\\n\\nThe menu is nice. Organized somewhat awkwardly, but it's easy enough to navigate. Any dish that is inherently hot and spicy is marked as such. \\n\\nSpiciness is where Anmol really shines. Whether you are timid about hotness or want the chef to make you cry, Anmol can do it. For any type of curry-based dish, they serve it mild, medium, or hot. Mild is seasoned, but not hot. Medium is seasoned and somewhat spicy, but nothing crazy. Hot is what it sounds like: a nice kick and a great reason to order an extra beer or cocktail to wash it down.\\n\\nService at Anmol is adequate. The staff seats you immediately and brings over water, papadum, and three different sauces for the papadum. Honestly, someone with a small stomach could probably fill up just on what Anmol gives you for free. Water comes steady, which is always nice. The only downside here is that the waiters sometimes do hover. Also, one of them looks like he should have Indiana Jones' still-beating heart in his hand. Jokes aside, there is nothing rude or unprofessional about the waiters at Anmol. \\n\\nThe bar is solid. I'm not a wine guy, so I can't speak on what they have. Beer selection is slightly above average. Guinness, Harpoon, UFO, Sam, Sam Seasonal, PBR ($2!) and others are on tap. They have some Indian-type beers and most standards in bottles. Not a destination spot for beer, but not a place void of anything drinkable. Mixed drinks are fine, but the fancier you get, the more likely you are to strike out. Jack and Coke? No problem. Chocolate martini? Maybe not...\\n\\nAesthetics. Simple design. A dozen or so booths and another large dining room with many tables. The lighting is on the dim side, but not too dark at all. The whole joint is very clean. Drive by some time at 10 AM and you're likely to see the waitstaff outside manicuring the grounds. This same cleanliness is present indoors too.\\n\\nAll in all, there isn't a long wrong with Anmol. I have had their naan, garlic naan, chicken pakora, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, chicken vindaloo and other dishes. I hardly have a favorite because it is all so good. Anmol taught me that I like Indian food.

Parking isn't too rough; though it always looks like there is a huge crowd; but there was no wait for a table when we went inside.\\n\\nThe ambience can seem a bit deceptive.  The way I'd describe it is \\"casual upscale meets dive bar meets sports bar.\\"  At least the inside looks more on the \\"upscale-ish\\" side, but when going outside to either of the pattios, you definitely have the sports bar vibe.  Speaking of \\"sports bar,\\" there's ZERO shortage of TVs, which means any sporting event that's on, you should have free roam of whatever event you want to watch.\\n\\nIt was between 4-8 so there's plenty of app specials during the week and we tried the brisket quesidillas which were pretty good.  Definiately worth it at the $5 special, but at the normal price of $10, I feel it's a bit on the pricy side (at least @ $10).\\n\\nWe also ordered 12 BBQ wings and a Pepperoni pizza.  The wings were really good, and not overly greasy which was a very nice touch.  The wings also had a nice smoky flavor that my g/f and I were very fond of.  As for the pizza, the crust was absolutely perfect.  Normally I'm a thin crust eater but this crust was among the best I've eaten in a VERY long time.  \\n\\nThe only thing is there were smokers outside; and it seems a bit close within the distance of the door for it to be allowed.

When I put the sesame seeds need my place mat anticipating to use it for my noodles, she came by and put it back on the tray. Ridiculous and unnecessarily bad customer service.

A couple of us from the cast heard about it and headed over. \\nWhen you get inside, the vibe is instantly great. There's a big dining room upstairs, an adjoining bar, and then to top it off, a really awesome basement lounge and bar to boot. \\nThat said, everyone at the table were BBQ fiends. When our stuff arrived, it all looked terrific and we had some glorious Maker's Mark Ice Tea concoctions to wash it down with. But once we dug beneath the surface, the food was seriously just so-so. The meat was dry and chewy, the cornbread...maybe the driest and blandest I've had anywhere, and just overall not awesome.\\nI've been back several times since then. My sister now lives in Somerville and I get up from NYC once a month or so to hang out and we always inevitably end up pulling up a seat at the bar in the basement when I do. The food is still just so-so. I had the \\"chili\\" last week and I am not kidding when I say that it was basically beef broth with three biggish chunks of cubed steak in it. No beans. No onions. No tomatoes. The broth was tasty and the meat was good....but chili, it wasn't.\\nNow all of that said...I still really like Redbones. I like the staff. Everyone's friendly and cool. The bartenders are great and nice and fun. I LOVE the decor. Redbones had the great sense to hire a local artist (and a great one!) to draw murals all over the walls and create sculptures for the doors and ceilings. The result is a one of a kind feel that makes you feel someplace special. It has that \\"There's only ONE Redbones!\\" vibe that rocks. The basement bar is dim, relaxed, and chill and the beer and spirit list is long and affordable. The last time I was up there, they had some awesome NY micro-brews (ala Six Points) and a sick Bourbon list. \\nAll in all I would say that I would highly recommend hitting Redbones as a pre-cursor to dinner and night out elsewhere or as a great place for a night cap. I think that a little exploration in the kitchen to yield juicier, moister, and more flavorful BBQ options would slide this place easily into 5 star land.\\nIn the meantime, I kind of feel like a regular and hope I haven't made any enemies by yelping my mind. It's just my opinion...and growing up in Kansas, when it comes to BBQ, I know that there are some heated ones about it! But I got lots of love for Redbones and everyone there.

The muffins were sturdy while still being fluffy, and the bacon was gloriously thick and savory. \\n\\nWe really enjoyed the cinnamon roll, but it's definitely different than your typical yeast cinnamon roll. It was a little crumblier, but in a pleasant way, and the frosting ratio was just right (meaning there was lots of it pooling in and around the roll). \\n\\nWe always love trying a chef's special and ours was quite good though probably not the star of the meal.

Orders are regularly wrong, the attitude of the help is truly un-customer friendly. The owners, who have several locations, should invest the time in training the staff.

After reading their review and a few of the others on Yelp, we decided to give this trendy restaurant a try.\\n\\nThe restaurant was fully booked for the weekend we wanted to go so we opted for Monday on Halloween. We arrived to small restaurant. It is quaint and feels like an old country farmhouse. There is a real fireplace in the waiting area. \\n\\nWe were trying to keep our expectations low despite all of the rave reviews. The food lived up to our lowered expectations. The breads, although interesting, were not ground-breaking in flavor. The 9grain was the best tasting one, followed by a pumpkin and gruyere brioche (whose name sounds utterly delicious but tastewise was utterly disappointing, not much flavor at all) and then the sea bread.\\n\\nWe shared a pumpkin soup that was very good. The cheese they used to top it was strong, which was definitely a pro. It was rich and creamy and therefore a nice winter soup.\\n\\nWe ordered four half dishes. A squash tart which was the most enjoyable, the scallops which were good but not particularly memorable as others seem to suggest. Our final two dishes were the buckwheat rigatoni, which was rather plain and served tepid, and the chicken breast that although tasty and tender did not surpass any expectation or provide any groundbreaking flavor.\\n\\nOur desserts were rather disappointing. We had the cheese platter that came with one slice of cheese. It was a nice strong goat's milk cheese however the dish itself was rather plain. The apple trifle that we also ordered was too sweet for either of our tastes.\\n\\nThe service was very good and our waiter was very attentive. By no means is Bondir a bad place, it is simply not exceptional, at least for us. Also, while it is a nice touch to change the menu daily, the one we had was particularly limited for someone who doesn't eat pork and wants something heartier than chicken. The only options that night were two ham dishes, two chicken dishes and scallops. The lack in protein options also influenced our restaurant review.

In addition, the fried egg atop my biscuit did not have the runny, custardy yolk that is characteristic of perfect fried eggs. Instead, it was a fried flat of scrambled egg, which contributed little to my biscuit sandwich. \\n\\nAside from that, the grits (stone-ground corn with cream and lots of butter) were delicious in that special, artery-clogging way, as were the bacon & green onion filled hush puppies (even better when dipped in a side of Texas Pete hot sauce.) I love PSB's eclectic selection of sodas, which includes Cheerwine, NuGrape and BubbleUp. The restaurant's layout is cozy, and the decor (woodsy, industrial, with open windows streaming the occasional ray of sun, and hanging mason jar lights) is informal and relaxing. \\n\\nI would probably give PSB another try, in hopes of nomming down the perfect biscuit with some delicious-sounding sides (spicy collard greens, fried green tomatoes, hash browns, hot apples, etc.) ... but only if someone else insisted on dining there."},{"name":"Refuge Cafe","address":"155 Brighton Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Had a delicious BLT yesterday.

I prayed to the restaurant gods, \\"Please let the food live up to the atmosphere\\", and thankfully, it did. So did the service.\\n\\nI've only been to Barcelona once (will fix that), but it was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Columbus. I went with a friend for lunch and we split several small dishes and ordered larger individual dishes for ourselves - we pigged out to be quite frank, but she was visiting from out of town, and I was avoiding work, so it was one of those perfect afternoons during which pigging out is entirely called for. \\n\\nWe split a cheese plate and the calamari, and the calamari was not your average calamari, which is oftentimes underwhelming at most restaurants. Not at Barcelona. The calamari here is perfection - fresh, \\"meaty\\" and lightly-breaded, tasting just barely fried so all the calamari flavor comes through. It's served with a rich aioli and a bright tomato vinaigrette. All the cheeses were outstanding - a manchego stands out in my memory as particularly indulgent.\\n\\nI enjoyed a brief affair with a lobster grilled cheese as my individual large plate It was brief because I devoured every last bite and barely resisted the urge to lick my plate. I'm a tough audience when it comes to lobster, and I almost passed on this assuming that the lobster would be sup-bar or overcooked since it would be hidden among melty cheese and between crusty bread (also cheese + seafood = usually a bad sign). I'm glad I took the chance because the lobster was perfect on its own, sweet, buttery, and perfectly cooked. The cheese was distributed lightly enough to let the lobster shine and the griddled bread added the perfect amount of crunch to send this sandwich right out of this world. It doesn't appear to be on the current menu, but for the love of sandwiches, keep your eyes peeled for its hopefully eventual return.\\n\\nLike the food and interior, the service was superb.

My coworker and I went on lunch, and she politely asked for more guacamole and the woman (who is notorious for the skimpy portions in particular) told her she'd have to charge her for guacamole twice. Unbelievable- We now choose to go to the chipotle in UA or on main campus to avoid the skimpy portions.

Drinks are on the pricey side, DJ that night sucked - seriously my 10 y.o. nephew can be better at that, club's stuff was really rude. We got all our drinks and set at the table when 15 minutes later we were told the table was reserved and we had to move all our shit somewhere else. Mantra lady said it exactly like this: \\"Table was reserved. Move NOW!\\" So we did move after a big debate, however we lost 2 umbrellas, 1 scarf and one hat as a result of it. If I was not with my friends I would have shown that lady my middle finger and left the club right away. I had to stick around for another 1,5 hours - what a waste of my time!

For my meal, I had the breakfast burger, and while I've had breakfast burger selections at a variety of restaurants, I think the one at Kraft House might be my favorite.

There's so much cheese in it that the cheesy goodness overpowers anything else!\\n\\nI ordered a classic shrimp, andouille sausage & grits for my entree and I was not disappointed! The dish had a great kick to it, but wasn't too spicy. The shrimp and sausage were plentiful and the grits were cooked just the way they should be. I wasn't particularly fond of the gravy it was served with, so I might ask for that on the side or ask for less of it. Two at our table ordered the chicken rita, with a lemon-type sauce, and I thought that tasted incredible.\\n\\nWe couldn't complete our jazzy jaunt without ordering some beignets, and they did not disappoint.

Growing up, we had nearly ALL of our family weddings here. Well, it was either at House of Louie or across the street when Great Wall use to be there and then there was always the legendary Lung Fung (which later turned into Legin).

My cousin and I believe they still have \\"business\\" in that back banquet room, but it's away from the public eye. Anyway - pardon the tangent - back the food. There isn't much to say.

Plus I do like the ambiance which is quite unlike China Town. Much more lighting, very old school decor, quite a few different kinds of seating options, less noisy. Very few places in China Town meet those simple requirements of a simple dining experience with a touch of sophistication.\\n\\nWe were in the mood for noodles. So we stayed with 2 straight forward options. Both were quite different yet very good. \\n\\nFirst was Singapore Rice noodles. I totally love rice noodles. And the Singapore style is probably on my top 5 favorites list. This preparation was done right. Not oily at all, the combination of spices was near perfection. Predominent were the flavors of Turmeric and Cinnamon, and possibly chinese five spices. The dish was not overpowered with an excess of anything. A good balance of proteins in the form of sauteed shrimp and strips of pork, and some fried egg. Onions, red and green peppers rounded up the veggies. Very satisfying dish indeed.\\n\\nNext was a very contrasting Seafood Egg noodles dish with the XO sauce. Now I honestly don't know what does XO sauce consists of, but it has a very complex set of flavors - in a very good way. My guess would be a concoction of soy sauce, fish sauce, and much more. The dish had a kick since we asked for spicy. The egg noodles were soft and very well cooked. The pieces of sea food were abundant but like the rice noodle dish, not overpowering and overtaking from the flavors of the XO sauce. Yet, everything was fresh and tasted yummy!\\n\\nThe host, and our waiter - both were really nice.

I arrived late morning on a Saturday to put my name on the list for 3 people, there was ruffly an hour wait at the time. The time went by fast and our 3rd person had to run a quick errand and was just parking when my name was called to be seated. She asked if my whole party is there and I replied, \\" Yes, he's just parking,\\" She replied \\" I'll get you a table once your 3rd person is here.\\"..I paused and said, \\"Ok. So help understand why you won't seat me until my whole party is here.\\" She began to explain that they don't have to time to wait for people who say someone's parking but in reality people aren't showing up for an hour or two and the server is stuck with a table that has people coming and going. Blah, blah, blah, and if I don't like it than there's plenty of other places to go get breakfast.  Because she's just doing her job and that it's not her policy but the restaurants policy...... Then this sweet lady came up and waived her away to continue hosting and asked if everything is ok. I explained what happened and that I understand the business side of making sure the whole party is there when they are seated, however, I disliked the attitude the host was displaying. The lady basically said sorry and here's your table....\\n\\nWhen you tell a customer to go some place else if they don't like it, you're telling them that they don't matter because there's someone else that will come here regardless if you do or not.

Remember you're in business because of your customers. Remember that customer service includes communication and interacting with people.

Have more class people!\\n\\nI will not be going back to Jam. You've lost me a customer because what you've portrayed to me is that me coming to your establishment means nothing.

First off, it is a little tricky finding the actual restaurant since it is located on the basement of a building (apartment complex). They have a free valet service and the valets direct you to where the actual restaurant is located so at least that helped. I came here on a Friday night and it was absolutely packed so that is generally a good thing. Luckily I had made a reservation in advance so there was no need to wait. The ambience was very classy with everyone dining there dressed up in suits and dresses which clearly portrayed the fine dining aspect of the Italian restaurant. \\n\\nOur server promptly brought us water and explained the specials and highlights of the menu. A few minutes later another server came and gave us the exact same speech that the first one did so that was a little repetitive. I think there might have been some confusion between the servers at first but our original server was our only server for the rest of the dinner. Our bread got brought out relatively late and our server also took a while to take our orders as people from other tables that arrived after us got their service faster than us. \\n\\nWe ordered some fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil to start off and it was delicious. For the main courses, we ordered a marinated chicken dish and a risotto dish. Both were just average, nothing special about them. We never got our bread refilled so that was a disappointment, but our water was constantly refilled by the drink servers so at least that wasn't an issue. Then came dessert time which is my favorite part of the meal. We got the chocolate mousse cake which just didn't meet my expectations for a nice Italian restaurant. \\n\\nMy expectations were pretty high for La Grotta after hearing such good things about it but it did not even come close to what I expected. I don't know if it was just one flawed outing but I don't agree that this is one of the top Italian spots in Atlanta. I probably will go to it at again to give it another chance but there are better, less expensive fine dining Italian establishments in Atlanta."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped here on my way up to Seattle.

The appetizers consisted of tuna stuffed peppers, goat cheese stuffed avocados, olives, and Marcona almonds.

Very straight forward tomato flavor finished with an excellent olive oil, cucumber slices and sliced red grapes. Wonderfully refreshing. \\n\\nFor the entrees we had a paella, a surf and turf, lamb chops, and crab cakes. Of the 4 the filet and half lobster tail was good, but was clearly overshadowed by the other entrees. 2 double cut lamb chops served exactly medium rare over sweet potato fries and a small arugula salad may have been the best lamb chops I have ever eaten.

It was salted perfectly (lamb is almost always under salted) and had just enough fat to keep it moist without that sometimes fatty greasy mouth feel. \\n\\nThe paella contained short ribs cut from the bone, scallops, and brussels sprouts. A weird sounding combination that came together perfectly. The fattiness of the meat, the sweetness of the scallops, and the bitterness of the sprouts was a wonderful combination. \\n\\nAs for the crab cakes, pure crab flavor, Not the filler with some crab thrown in for flavoring.

Now mind you, they have numerous other offerings, such has hot dishes, soups, oysters, crab legs, etc.  So....why the 3 stars?\\n\\nI would rank this as a pretty solid buffet, and for 30 bucks a person for dinner, with all of the vast offerings, that isn't bad.  BUT this is more of a lunch place, or go with your family/group of friends.

They were more than accommodating but I felt like an assclown.  I am giving as accurate review as I can based on what I had, the sushi wasn't amazing, but for a buffet, it's pretty darn good.

I think they got reviewed by a bunch of hillbillies who have never encountered an escalator before. The restaurant is in the upstairs part of a building in downtown Atlanta where space is limited for obvious reasons and yes, you have the option of walking up regular stairs, getting on an escalator, or getting in an elevator. It makes sense to me but I didn't just fall off of a turnip truck.\\n\\nAnyway, this is not your typical cookie cutter Mexican restaurant that most people are used to. It is a Latin fusion type of restaurant. What that means is that the rice and beans are going to be different and the salsa is going to taste a lot better. \\n\\nThe food is a little pricy. You can't show up and expect to order from a lunch menu and pay about $5 for a plate of food that could feed a family of 4 like you can at some Mexican restaurants. I don't count this against them because their prices are competitive with everything else surrounding them and the food is actually worth it. I have spent more money on worse food in this area of town several times.\\n\\nI got pineapple chicken tacos and my friend got steak tacos for lunch here. We both thought they were great and we left there feeling stuffed. I would certainly go back. They have really good outdoor seating where you can sit there and stare at Peachtree St from above. We got good service too.

When I got my first prescription there, they also gave me a $20 gift card.\\n-I've heard that their prepared food is pretty good, although I haven't eaten it.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Prices have gone up since they opened and generally are higher than a competing grocery store such as Market Basket.  They had some cheap promotions to generate buzz at the beginning, like $1 5 pound bags of flour and $1 5 pound potatoes which don't exist anymore.  There are some cheaper items still, especially if you buy the larger family packs, but it's generally more than Market Basket.\\n-Meat in particular seems more expensive here than other places\\n-Many staff are new/inexperienced since this is a new store.

Flat iron steak n fries were also good but could've used more flavor in the bernaise sauce. Total cost for 4 apps, 2 mojitos, and a glass of Pinot gris....58$ plus a 12 dollar tip.

I could probably have saved half of or for lunch the next day, but I just couldn't resist finishing the whole thing. It was so good, I demolished the lobster roll in record time! One of my friends also got two oysters, and she thought they were really good. They offer oysters from all around, and you could eat an oyster from Rhode Island, or Massachusetts, and I think they even had one from California!\\n\\nThe service was really good! They were super attentive, great about refilling our water and clearing off the tables. The service, combined with the food gives makes this a 5 star place. Yes, it's a little crowded.

They heap a sizeable chunk of creamy goat cheese onto your salad along with a deliciously flavorful tomato chutney. The lamb is sliced like deli meat and doesn't taste strongly of lamb (it also has a roast beef consistency). I like this salad with balsamic. Another fave is the curried tuna as a salad (not bad as a sandwich either). I used to get these items 3-4 times a week when I worked in the area a few years ago. Recently got the lamb and it's still satisfying! Prices are about the same as any other place in the area and the flavors are generally better! I'm also amazed that the consistency and quality of the food has remained the same for the past 4-5 years, hence the 5 star review. \\n\\nIced coffee is smooth and they have liquid sweetener if you want to avoid grainy sugar cubes in your iced beverages. \\n\\nTake home goodies include many baked treats and snacks - granola is tasty, although on the pricier side at $10; their bag of biscotti is yummy and more reasonable. \\n\\nBaked goodies are delicious (yum savory scones!) and beautifully displayed. \\n\\nStaff are friendly.

I defiantly recommend the drinks and maybe a snack!"},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I've always wanted to go here because the idea of mini burgers and martini's sounds like an interesting night out. Their website says they are \\"unpretentious with a hip vibe\\"; I'd have to disagree on the unpretentious part. And before I forget, I'm sorry Hyatt that I went without you! I didn't enjoy it and I'm sure it would have been much better if you were there with me.... with that said...\\nThe decor was interesting, very clean and had an original look to it. Also, all of the male companions in our party pointed out the fact that the waitresses were HOTT. They all had a skimpy very stylish uniform look to them which was fine, but doesn't help me feel better about paying $6 for one itty bitty burger and  $9 for a sub-standard lobster bisque in an itty bitty cup that they tried to pass off as a bowl. The only reason this place gets three stars from me is because my Mango Shizzle Martini was pretty shizzle-tastic. For $13 it better be, but I'm pretty sure I could get it anywhere else. I'd like to say I'm just cheap, but I really don't have a problem spending good money on good food. I get it, their whole concept is little burgers with good martini's, which I guess if you want to hit it up for appetizers before going somewhere else wouldn't be a bad idea. I don't need a massive mound of food on my plate, but if it's going to be pricey, it better be pretty darn tasty. With that said, the burgers weren't anything special. Granted, you can choose from a cheeseburger or a lobster burger or lamb burger and even a veggie burger. Points for variety, but nothing we had really knocked our socks off. My only other problem with Match was that our group of 10 called a day ahead, made reservations and were forced to sit 8 at a table and put two of our friends at a table \\"near\\" by. We were told that there was a party of 50 in the bar area, and a party of 20 coming in shortly. There was definitely not 50 people occupying the bar area the whole time we were there, and the party of 20 (actually another 10 like ourselves) didn't show up until we were leaving almost 2hrs later. I wouldn't call it a bad night out, but nothing about this place makes me want to come rushing back anytime soon."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Neptune is awesome.

No air conditioning, which will be a problem if it's above 70 degrees outside, especially since it's packed most nights with hour plus wait times on the weekends.

They dry rub all their meat before they cook it and it's not gluten free. Here's the thing. It's outrageously easy to make a GF rub or convert a rub to GF. Cornstarch will replace flour quite easily. So, why don't they just keep some unseasoned meat aside for those with dietary restrictions or allergies? Because they don't give a damn. I spoke directly with the manager and they just don't see it as worthwhile making an effort. They have an allergy sheet listing the gluten free foods, which would be great if you were a vegetarian, but if you are..... what the hell are you doing at a BBQ place that's neon sign virtually screams \\"meat, meat, meat?\\" If you ask, they'll bring you \\"the book.\\" This is the allergen guide all restaurants are required by law to provide.

The tricky thing with getting mild is that most places won't put any spices in their mild one but if I get medium it is way too spicy. Their mild had just enough to let you know that it was still there but not overpowering. Again, perfect for me probably not everybody. An added bonus was the preparation of the noodles right in front of you. By this I mean they literally stretch and spin the noodles (probably not the most technically accurate description but I'm no expert).

The waitress was friendly, attentive, and very down to earth.  We had the pork quesadillas, shrimp tostadas, and queso.  The queso was just ok--nothing special at all.  I really liked the shrimp tostadas, the sauce wasn't too overpowering and the shells were crispy and fresh.  The pork quesadillas were the biggest hit--very tasty!

I went on a weekday as it was my friends birthday and I wanted to treat her. I made reservations and specifically stated that it's her birthday. Upon our arrival we were not even greeted by the hostess as she asked if we had reservations. \\nOnce we were seated at our table our waiter arrived shortly after to ask about drinks. I asked him which wines were the most popular. As he was in the middle of giving me a few to choose from he left mid conversation to help someone else. HOW RUDE! I was a bit shocked as the other table simply asked for more cheese and personally that could have waited for him to assist with after he was done helping me. \\nHe never came back to finish assisting me in selecting a bottle of wine! After I picked the wine based on Googling the wine selection I continued with my evening. He then came over to ask about our food choices. After we selected the pasta platter for two he said, \\" are you sure that's it.. It's not a lot\\". I'm sorry what? I've had the pasta platter and it's way more than enough to for two people. \\n\\nThe pasta platter was delicious. Lots of flavour and variety. That's the only reason I'm giving 2/5 stars is because of the food. The truffle spaghetti is amazing, but you need to be a fan of truffle oil! The meat balls were Devine as well. The pasta platter is the best option if you want to try a bit of everything and share it. It's a good bang for your buck in my humble opinion. \\n\\nAfter we were finished with our meal we asked to have it packed. ( side note the waiter didn't once check up on us and ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything) \\nWhen he came back to have our wine bottle removed from the table he accidentally hit me in the head with it and INSTEAD of saying sorry like any normal human being would do he said , \\" um excuse Me\\" and walked away. At this point dessert wasn't even an option I was so PISSED OFF! \\nI still left15% of a tip but only because the gentlemen who packed my food and served it were lovely.

It's a food cart, so there's just outdoor seating, but there are tarps/tents overhead so you can eat under cover when it's raining.\\n\\nI got here about 30 minutes after they opened, on an overcast day with only a few people in the lot.  Before I even ordered, I was told it'd be a 45 minute wait.  WTF?  But okay, maybe they had a ton of orders before me.  Got two items, a wrap and a sandwich.  Both turned out to be good, albeit simple, and the wrap was better (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, portobellos).  Not the greatest items I've ever had, but nicely put together and a decent breakfast.\\n\\nBut the WAIT.  I honestly do not understand why there was such a long wait.  I waited at least 45 minutes for my order and noticed that they called out only one order (with 1-2 items) every 5-10 minutes.  There clearly hadn't been some large order before mine, they were just THAT SLOW.  I don't know if they made one single item/order, cleaned up everything, and then began prepping for the next.  It was ridiculous.  These are egg sandwiches.  SIMPLE egg sandwiches, all with the same basic ingredients.  How does it taken 45 minutes to put it together???  By the time I finally got my food, I had taken a stroll down the entire length of Mississippi Ave (even stopping in to get donuts at Blue Star because I was hungry), window shopped, gotten coffee at another food cart, drank my coffee, and then sat some more watching orders slooooowly be filled by the Big Egg.  And while the food was good, it wasn't 45-minutes-or-more-of-wait-time good.  Again, it was an egg sandwich/wrap.  Without complicated or special ingredients.  And a small menu.  Their menu featured items that they could have (they SHOULD have) put together in like 10 minutes.  Maybe 15 minutes or, if I'm being generous and they're swamped, 20 minutes at MOST.  \\n\\nI don't understand why the food takes so long to come out of this cart.  Seriously, WHY?  Especially first thing in the morning, when they've first opened.  And especially when there is no indoor seating or things to otherwise entertain you while you wait.  \\n\\nI won't be going back.

I got the red beans and rice, which came with a spicy beef sausage. The dish was very flavorful and well presented. My husband got the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach, all of which I tasted. The temperature on the steak was done correctly, and the meat was tender and well seasoned. He devoured the mashed potatoes; they were super rich and creamy. The spinach was lightly sauteed, a good mild counterpoint to the other strong flavors. \\n\\nWe finished with beignets and cafe au lait, which were quite yummy. I prefer my beignets more squishy and dense, but these light, fluffy critters were actually pretty awesome. Cafe au lait was dee-lish too!! \\n\\nThe biggest thing they need to do is improve on the atmosphere. I do understand the restaurant is very new, and they seem to have done a good job on a tight budget, but the place felt a little sterile to me. There were some nice details, just not enough of them. The thing is that the ceilings are extremely high, and there just isn't enough on the walls (sorry, but the little clusters of mardi gras masks just don't work for me). Take a tip from the other locally owned places in town and put up a bunch of local art for sale.

The atmosphere is fine it's more like a high class pub with TVs playing sports. The wait wasn't long as it was only a Tuesday night. The kids menu was easy and more to the point than the regular adult menu which has way too much food and too confusing.  I ordered the calamari as my main course with a side salad, my youngest child had the corn dogs with a side of Caesar side salad, and my teenager had the chicken alfredo pasta my husband had the chicken wings.  The server forgot to bring my husband lemons for his drink three times as she passed by. She offered my son a side salad with his meal but failed to tell us that it was not part of the meal but it was an additional $3.50.  When the salads came out they had the wrong salad for my small child and were confused as to why we ordered a Caesar salad and why the waitress had approved it. Needless to say we did end up getting his salad. No big deal I could have gotten a better salad from a bag.\\nOnce the meals arrived, the food wasn't hot it was lukewarm. The wings were soggy not crispy, not great and the vegetables look like someone dropped them around hot sauce and they were messy. The corn dogs for some reason were served with dipping Caesar dressing instead of ketchup or any other kid friendly dipping sauce. My son did not like them as they were too sweet. The calamari was not great, I expected much better and I could have gotten the same out of a frozen bag of calamari fried at home. The best tasting was the chicken alfredo pasta even though it needed a bit of salt and it was over priced at $15. The waitress failed to come back to check on us a couple of times and my husband was given samples of beer and she forgot to come and ask him if he wanted an order of either one of them until it was way too late.

Regardless, they recently opened a location off of Guadalupe (the Drag) and I swung by to check it out.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Okay I'm not going to lie, I would never want to be taken here on a first date. The decor is what you'd expect from something on the Drag. It's kind of bare and warehouse like and the tables are slightly sporadically placed, but it does mainly cater to the UT crowd which consists of tons of undergrads so I can't really complain.\\n\\nService: I actually knocked off one star because of service. Long story short, the kitchen somehow lost my order ticket so while my friend got his food, I was left waiting... for 15 minutes. The good thing is that once I mentioned my missing order they immediately tried to fix things by first giving me a free order of samosas and then rushing out a duplicate of my original order. The ordering system itself can be confusing. You have the option of sitting down and ordering via the waiters/waitresses or going up to the counter and ordering yourself. We weren't sure of exactly how we should order so we actually went to the counter and then sat down. My recommendation is that if you're definitely eating there, sit at a table and wait for someone to take your order. Of course if you're getting your food to go, the counter is where it's at.\\n\\nFood: I really liked the food here. It redeemed the restaurant back into 4 stars for me even after the snafu with my missing order. The samosas were good, not too oily, but the ratio of peas to potato was definitely different from any other samosa I've ever had. They weren't very spicy which is something I like, but may be a problem for others. I got the egg curry combo with an extra order of potato naan. The combos are definitely a great deal if you like one of the combo items, however there's only 5 options as a combo so I can see myself just ordering a la carte next time. I chose the egg curry because I've never had egg curry and I wanted to give it a shot. The combos come with the curry you selected, an extra order of vegetable curry, naan, basmati rice, and rice pudding. It's a decent amount of food. \\n\\nI personally really liked their curries but I also don't like my curries spicy (contradiction I know because I love Sichuan hotpot). However I found them to be flavorful and complimented both the rice and naan well. The rice is basic basmati, nothing special. The naan is pretty good. It's nice and fluffy and has slight char marks. The rice pudding was very good and I'd probably get an extra order of this by itself next time.\\n\\nOverall I'd definitely recommend Teji's. It's a great alternative on the Drag and the food is actually good. Plus it's super cheap and pretty quick.

The atmosphere is comfortable.\\n\\nThen comes getting to know each other a little more. Service is ok. It's a little slow, but she's cheerful when she's around. Chips and salsa were superb and disappeared into our stomachs quickly. The chicken enchiladas with habanero cream sauce were pretty good. I especially like the dollop of guacamole on top and the surprise potato chunks in the enchiladas. (Were they supposed to be there?) And, my friend and I jumped on the valet deal posted and got a free dessert - the chocolate tres leches cake with chocolate whipped cream, which was a huge slice, but the edges of the cake were dry.\\n\\nIt was a fun time, but at the end, I wavered between 3 and 4 stars because I had wanted it to be great, but it just felt like something, that spark, was missing.

The staff is so welcoming and they make such a positive impact on one's dining experience. I started my lunch off with the smoked mackerel. I love smoked mackerel, & the way they paired it with goat cheese, crispy potato & pickled onions...magnifique! The pur√©ed lovage has this celery flavor that made for interesting flavor combinations. \\n\\nI then had the duck confit. It was delicious, but on the dryer side. I kind of wished there were more cherries to add more acidity to the dish. \\n\\nAnd finally I had the Ille flottante. A perfect way to end the meal. It was absolutely divine. The toasted meringue and peanut combination with the creme anglaise... Absolutely genius. Both my waitress & host/server explained to me how the name of the dish means floating island. Made the experience feel very whimsy. \\n\\nI also got a glass of the Arterberry Pinot noir & a glass of the graves Bordeaux. The glass of Bordeaux brought me back to my trip to Bordeaux.

The place is small and quaint like all the other eateries in the North End.  There was a wait, but not as long as Giacomo's.  My friend and I had the oysters.  I loved that they had a list describing the type of taste of the oyster.  I didn't know that oysters had distinctive flavors...some can be saltier, briney, or buttery.  They were all excellent and made up for the dehydrated oysters at Union Oyster House.  I had the Lobster Roll with the meat hot and my friend had the sturgeon.  Both were excellent and the lobster roll was extremely tasty.  The bread appeared to be fresh, was very soft and buttery and the lobster was moist and soft and full of flavor.

Well, perhaps not the plague. Maybe I avoid the North End like the flu, as I do head there occasionally. But the point is that the hordes of tourists and the restaurants that get by serving their unknowing patrons lackluster, and often, inauthentic cuisine, prevent me from staying too long. It's no surprise that my favorite place in the North End, Neptune Oyster, is a seafood restaurant with an emphasis on shellfish.\\n\\nI have been meaning to try the lobster rolls at Neptune for, I kid you not, four years or so.  I needed to know if a roll in a sit down restaurant with a $25 price tag really did trump all of those served up at seaside shacks. So, I clearly took my dad here for Father's Day out of loving daughterly devotion and not at all out of the need to satisfy my own selfish shellfish affinity...\\n\\nThe tiny spot, with its nautical tiling and window full of fresh oysters, clams, and shrimp, probably only seats forty, three-quarters of them with lobster roll in hand. For one who tries to avoid tourist traps, I may have come to the wrong place. In fact, while waiting to be seated, one family on the street told us they were from Maryland and had tried on two other trips to Boston to get in.\\n\\nBut trap Neptune was not. The restaurant satisfies both CT-style lobster lovers and everyone else by offering its rolls hot with butter or cold with mayo. I told my father that there were rules to our outing: We were to each order a lobster roll. One had to be buttered, one had to be mayoed. We were to split these evenly. We were to eat the buttered one first so as to enjoy it while warm. Again, I stress the daughterly devotion. \\n\\nRules and regulations, though, went out the window, because both of us had strong preferences. My dad only had eyes for the cold lobster roll, but I did steal a bite or two and was impressed. Both rolls featured only whole pieces of claw, knuckle, and tail meat which were substantial and weighty, yet not at all chewy. The brioche bun certainly tipped its hat to the traditional hot dog roll and its light sweetness heightened the extreme sweetness of the lobster. This was not, however, a refined experience. Whole pieces of lobster means a whole lotta mess. The soft bun perfectly encased the cold lobster but quickly split when topped with, no saturated by, the buttered lobster, which sent streams of fat down my arms. \\n\\nAlthough, \\"streams of fat\\" may not sound particularly appetizing, I definitely have to declare the lobster roll with butter the winning sandwich. The sweet butter gave the lobster such depth and richness while allowing what we paid $25 dollars for to shine. I would certainly also order the cold roll again. The coating of mayonnaise was so very light and added a sexy silkiness to the experience. It also gives you the option of forgoing the knife and fork if you simply want to hunker down and eat the lobster roll as it was meant to be eaten.\\n\\nAs for the sides, the roll is served with a heaping pile of fries, which I expected to only be a forgettable requisite but which were instead well-seasoned and nicely browned. I opted for some mixed greens, which were woefully overdressed. I've heard great things about other menu offerings and the raw bar, which I would love to try, but as I said, there were rules to this trip.\\n\\nJust as you sometimes feel the need to get the burger from Radius, I guess there's a time and a place for a good $25 lobster roll."},{"name":"Ichiza Kitchen & Tea House","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Have been wanting to check out Ichiza for quite a while.

I also label them as such to distinguish them from fried chicken subs you might order at your local supermarket or sandwich fast food chain. \\n\\nChicken schnitzel, which is the staple item of Seven Hens, is served in either baguettes or wraps.  The standard \\"build your own\\" schnitzel is $5.99 (+ tax) and includes an assortment of free toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, mayo, BBQ sauce, or the \\"SH\\" spicy sauce).  Premium sauces and toppings (chipotle aioli, fried egg, dill-caper sauce) are available for $0.50 to $1.00 per sauce or topping.  There are also signature schnitzels, which are custom combinations that can be purchased as sandwiches, platters, or salads.\\n\\nThe vegetables are very fresh.  The chicken schnitzel is definitely way better than the standard chicken tender usually served on a fried chicken sandwich.   The breading is thin but crunchy.  Also, the meat is juicy.  Whole pieces of chicken are cut into pieces immediately before addition to your sandwich.  The SH sauce is only slightly spicy, but there is a little, pleasant kick to the sauce.\\n\\nMy baguette was good, but if Seven Hens tweaked the bread to make it a little better, I'd be inclined to add an extra star.  Parking at this Seven Hens location requires patience.  To maximize space, there isn't any room to navigate between the aisles of the parking lot - so you'll be turning in and out of Clairmont Road/North Decatur Road.  Best bet- start searching for spaces in the aisle further away from the storefront."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Love it!

Expectations were met and left as a happy camper. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Luke's trio (which comes with 1/2 a lobster roll, crab roll and shrimp roll) and a small cup of clam chowder to snack on before we head over to the Red Sox game. The consistency of the lobster roll and clam chowder were just like the ones in New York. The chowder was creamy but not thick or chunky, and the rolls were a mouthful and delicious at every bite. The price was slightly higher at this location as oppose to the ones in New York (which I find odd) but nonetheless it's definitely a must try if you're into lobster rolls & clam chowders."},{"name":"Mantra Restaurant","address":"52 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Horrible.

Unfortunately I previously set the bar a little high by doing a lamb roast with veggies in a slow cooker for an entire day...  I contemplated doing my family's 'amazing rib recipe' with potatoes and veggies but it's a 1 hour+ affair and I couldn't really think of anything else that I both wanted to cook, and/or felt inspired to cook.  And then I remembered Indish... I had walked past their old stall at Granville Market in the Fall and dually noted their amazing idea for future needs- just like this one.\\n\\nI checked out their website which (note: which was up to date with their current seasonal options) was very helpful in describing the differences between Chef, Heat or Micro-to-serve, the meal options, and the prep times.  I called them up and they were very friendly- answering my many questions regarding the detail and idiot-proofness of the instructions, prep time, portion sizes etc- even running over to the chef to ask him a few things.\\n\\nI stopped by to pick up my 'Chef in a bag' meal and was delighted to see they also have a very impressive lunch menu and decided to sit down and enjoy their 'gourmet grilled cheese sandwich' with either free cookie or free side salad.  I went with the salad (knowing if I ate and liked the cookie that I'd end up leaving with a dozen of those, too).  Both delicious.\\n\\nI also noticed their 'heat and serve' cooler which included \\"Herb Encrusted Chicken Breast with Mushroom Risotto\\" in a frozen-lunch style tray/lid... oops that just ended up in my pile as well.  (Haven't eaten it yet- will advise!)\\n\\nI made the meal that same night (last night) but was advised it could be stored up to 4 days.  Each ingredient was portioned out in a little bag (or foil) with a handy little ID label.  The cooking instructions were perfect- giving that little bit more details that you often find yourself wishing for in many recipes.  The plating instructions were a nice added touch, as well.  Everything cooked as directed (although I admit I seared my tuna a bit longer, we like it a bit firmer).  \\n\\nThe result: It really did take only half an hour to make + plate.  It looked amazing.  And- it tasted AMAZING.  There was so much flavor in the tuna from the marinade, the tuna itself must have been incredibly fresh because the tuna flavor was very subtle without even a hint of fishiness.  It was by far the best that either of us have had and I only just started eating tuna- having had it for the first time in Hawaii.  Every single drop was good- the potatoes, the sauces to drizzle, the reduction, the beet- amazing.  And the portion was right too- my date ate all of his and I had a bit of potato left over.  Full but not food-baby full.  Perfect!\\n\\nThe best part is I got to make something I hadn't otherwise tried before (searing tuna, baking a beat, sauce reduction, etc.) and I now know what kind of potatoes I'm going to be making from now on!  The recipes aren't impossible to repeat but- as is their edge- you would spend less buying their 'meal in a bag' than if you tried to repeat it all at the grocery store (since obviously some items would come in larger portions than you need for one meal).  \\n\\nBrilliant business idea, amazing flavor, delicious food, and I learned something new!

First, I LOVE tater tots... I LOVE ranch dressing... They use the 'ranch on fire' seasoning on the tots and have AMAZING ranch dressing (in house made I assume). I've been back several times since my first and each time the staff is super kind and polite and the wings are made to order, hot and perfectly cooked. This is a great place to take someone who hasn't had wings or dosen't like digging in as the 'chicken lollypops' are very easy to eat. The 'ranch on fire' is pretty spicy but VERY salty so if you're not a sodium fan, go with sometime like the sweet chili. The garlic parmesan are SUPER good and low on the spice meter. I can't say enough that these wings are THE BEST IN AUSTIN, hands down IMHO. I haven't tried the hottest wings as I'm not a fan of the 'so hot you can't taste them' but a good friend of mine is and swears by them.

I recently went for Saturday brunch with a friend who is a big eater, but whose idea of brunch didn't extend far beyond the likes of Waffle House.  As the bruncher that I am, I felt like it was my duty to introduce him to the world of fine brunches and I knew Murphy's was the place for that.  Murphy's does not take reservations during brunch.  We arrived around 1pm and waited maybe 10 minutes for a table.\\n\\nOk favorite part about Murphy's- the sweet tea. It comes unsweetened with a lemon and a spoon.  Then they bring you this little silver cup of sweetened water or syrup (who knows what it actually is) but you add it to taste and BAM, best sweet tea in this town. Of course for brunch they have your standard mimosa or bloody mary but I shall forever more choose the sweet tea. \\n\\nBefore your food comes out, you will be treated with a basket of goodies.  Ours contained a cheese biscuit served with mixed berry jam and house honey butter as well as a mixed berry muffin.  The biscuits were flaky and buttery and everything you should expect from a delicious Southern biscuit.  One could probably eat the honey butter with a spoon if they wanted. Its good stuff. Also, before you are totally distracted by your food, take in the incredibly charming atmosphere.  The open and airy setting makes me feel so relaxed. The warm colors and comfortable seating just boost it's homey feel that much more. \\n\\nFor my meal I ordered the Eggs T. Murphy with grits which are basically eggs Benedict and my friend ordered the pork hash with a side of hash-browns. Ok- my one complaint. I don't LOVE their hollandaise sauce and my eggs weren't exactly hot.  They were more room temperature as if they had been sitting for a little bit.  My meal was still delicious and the grits were AHHHMAZING.

I order this dish every single time and I never get bored of it! I also tried the XL Beef Noodle Soup #12 which I could never finish and the soup base and various cuts of meat are Delicious! As for appetizers, you never go wrong ordering the the fresh or fried spring roll ! I also love their avocado shake-oh-so creamy and sweet! During busy hours, your lunch or dinner get expedited quickly as well as you being rushed by waiters because it's a very popular place and they want to serve as many customers as possible so don't expect to lounge around during busy time. Highly recommend it! I'm a repeat customer for years! Lucky for me, my work is a 10 min walk away for a quick healthy lunch!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I was in Boston for the weekend. I enjoy good Lobster rolls. I saw that Neptune Oyster appeared on many \\"Best Lobster Rolls\\" and best places to eat. Based on the 1000+ reviews on Yelp, I had high expectations\\n\\nFirst thing to know is the wait:\\n\\nI arrived at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. This place is packed and there is a 2+ hour wait for parties 2 or more. As I was traveling solo, I was able to get a seat at the bar within 15 minutes. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself has limited seating and the waitstaff does a great job of trying to manage it. They will take your name and number and will call you as your table is getting close. If you aren't a patient person, I would recommend you skip this place.\\n\\nThey have both a warm and cold lobster roll. The server I had seemed to push for the warm lobster roll which is done with butter. \\n\\nThe food came out in about 10 minutes. The bun had simple grill marks, the lobster itself was nicely cooked. For $25, the portion size was small. It was served with fries which were nice."},{"name":"American Craft","address":"1700 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"All right I really enjoyed drinking and eating at American Craft the other day.

The crust was dry and airy like pizza that is not a chain restaurant-but, left overnight the next day. For dominos you can leave overnight. But, the flying saucer is a good restaurant that has pizza you can eat right away that is good. Like it is specialty. But, if left over the next day the dough taste weird.  Which is why I know it was left over from the day before. I ordered cheese pizza. N the emulsion on the cheese was soggy and oily. When I brought it up, they said changes were made in Janurary about two months ago and this is how it has been with a salt and pepper on the crust. it wasn't salt and pepper. It was left over pizza. somebody that doesn't know what they are doing gave directions to a really good individual culinary pizza chain.  The result is dominoes standards in a boutique pizza restaurant.  and the worker there said it is just the peppers and salt changed.  no manager since he stepped out.

Being a local, I continue to be excited about this new opening on Southie's west side. It is an extremely welcomed addition to a neighborhood overly crowded with pizza places and quick marts, and since it opened has become my go-to for dinner or drinks in the area.\\n\\nThat being said, I've found that there is inconsistency in both service and in menu pricing. The service has ranged from fantastic to less than average, but I have tend to have an overall positive experience. As for the pricing, the menu takes some navigating and analyzing. Why is the very weak and limited Bibb salad as much as the delicious, ginormous burger and fries? How come you can get a [reasonably sized] side portion of french toast for $4, but the regular portion is $12? There are some issues there, but it just takes some figuring out in the end.\\n\\nAnd now onto the food. I am very impressed by most of the food offered at Lincoln. On opening night I ordered the short rib over truffle mac n' cheese which was great, but not perfect. I expect this has gotten better since opening night. I am a huge fan of the burger and suggest it to everyone who goes to Lincoln. This thing is made with high-quality meat, piled with sauteed onions, and smothered with cheese and bacon aioli. Amazing. Other highlights include the meatball and polenta appetizer (seriously good) and the seared tuna steak. On the other end of the spectrum, I was very disappointed with the Bibb salad and thought the chicken sandwich was just okay.\\n\\nOverall I LOVE the space & atmosphere (huge area, lots of seating, long bar, good music, lots of TVs during game time), am very happy with the food thus far, and especially like that the restaurant is just steps from my apartment. Yay!"},{"name":"Gaslight Lynnfield","address":"1100 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"Great meal.

Hands down, best. Why did I give this only 3 stars then? Well, a restaurant's reputation doesn't live by food reputation alone. I also work in a restaurant on the side - so that kinda colors my vision as well.\\n\\nI read some really good things about Neptune Oyster and its food and was pretty excited to eat there. Being from San Francisco, I'm fairly spoiled for food quality when I go out. I really enjoy a good meal and I was excited to try some great seafood. \\n\\nSo I walked in and saw it busy - an AWESOME sign of a good place. I saw people were busy, so I figured I'd give it a few. Good things come to those who wait, right? Then a Bostonian comes in and started asking me if I went to the back and talked to the waitress about getting on the list yet. Huh? You mean it's ok to barge into a restaurant and pile on more work to the already busy waitstaff? From what I learned, this is pretty standard as a practice in the area. I was a little horrified and I didn't see this as a service - I saw this as the restaurant not setting boundaries on their customers. Walking in to give a reservation to a busy waitress (most likely in the middle of another task) would be like going into the kitchen to ask where your food order is (and kitchens typically don't like that). Let people do their jobs. \\n\\nAnyway, the waitress came over to take my number, which was fine. It got weird when I asked if I could have a glass of wine while I waited. I mean, I'm a single diner and based on the area code, obviously from out of town and not sure where to go. All I got in response was that I couldn't have a drink and wait (only drinking while dining at the bar, which is fine) - but no suggestions as to where to go. Odd. I know from working where I do, if we had to tell someone to wait somewhere else, we'd give a suggestion at least.\\n\\nSo I started walking around the block and then my phone rang with a number I didn't recognize. I figured it must have been the restaurant. My phone rang twice and that was it. I hurried back to wait some more (again, they were busy - I could appreciate that). When the waitress finally got to talk to me, my seat was given away. She claimed she called me a few times (entirely possible even though my phone said once) and put me back on the list. But then I got to thinking - what if I went somewhere for a drink and had to potty. Unless I'm very rude - who answers a phone while going potty? - that's kinda gross. Maybe if the people there left a message? Not sure why they don't.\\n\\nAnyway, moving on. After a few minutes I got a seat - mission accomplished. I then ordered some oysters, mussels (awesome) and a salad (awesome). After close to 30 minutes, there were still no oysters. WTH! Apparently they had a new shucker for the night. Again, it's fine if someone is new, but obviously, this person wasn't trained right or still needed to shadow someone to get more up to speed. I finally got the oysters, 30 minutes after ordering - but apparently there were people waiting longer than me!\\n\\nI guess my experience there was laden with management problems - which really colored my vision of the place being great and wanting to come back (good food alone is not enough). I don't blame any of the waitstaff or the oyster shucker. It's a busy place and people need to be enabled to do their jobs. Again, I also have my view because I work in a restaurant as well.\\n\\nMy suggestions to management:\\n--have a self-managed list for people to signup for a table. We do this all over the place in San Francisco - people signup and put a phone number or whatever. It takes the burden off of the staff to manage a list. People can write down a name and wait or walk. They get it.\\n\\n--have a voicemail left when a table is ready. Maybe tell someone you have 5-10 minutes to show or else your table is gone. What if the person is in the bathroom or indisposed somehow? To lose your table over that is just - well - kinda uncool.\\n\\n--don't allow customers to come in and interrupt waitstaff. People can wait - and make that clear. The interruption these new customers provide doesn't give anyone any better service. Except getting themselves on the list - see item 1.\\n\\n--If someone is new - help them to succeed and not throw them into the fire. They waited WAY too long to get the poor new guy help. I mean - it's obvious he's not ready. Maybe he needs more training during the day. Sure he did get help - but after being 30 minutes behind? Really?\\n\\nThis place is really great foodwise....I just fear that over time, there will be somewhere new with equally good food and the business here will die off. I hope next time I visit Boston I can swing by with less aggravation and have a more relaxed time. It's a great place, it really is....just these side issues make the entire experience less than stellar."},{"name":"Asian House","address":"407 Cheney Hwy","city":"Titusville","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing.

When we were seated they already had toddler appropriate utensils and a cup at the table ready for our little one and they seated us near the play area.\\n\\nThe food was also incredible and let's be honest, that is the real reason you go to a restaurant. Not only was it delicious, but the menu has multiple options for folks who are vegetarian, vegan and/or gluten free. I switched to a mostly plant based diet nearly a year ago and one of the foods I have missed is biscuits and gravy.  Wow, was I impressed with the vegetarian biscuits and gravy here!!!!! It absolutely satisfied the craving and the flavor was on point. I never would have guessed by the flavor or texture that this was a vegetarian version. I also had the florentine eggs Benedict which comes with a side of hash browns.

It's already a place we feel confident walking into any time and knowing we'll get a nice meal in a very pleasant place with exceptionally nice servers.\\n\\nThe first was just after Christmas around 2 pm and overdue on lunch.  We had a small sampling of some smaller plates (given we had a family dinner that night): tuna tacos, chicken wings, b-sprouts.  All were cooked/prepared appropriately and a nice balance of flavors/textures/temperatures.  We ordered a couple of cocktails, then followed with a draft.  Other than the cocktails takinga bit too long to prepare (maybe too bar-chef-y than they needed to be) but good overall flavor with enough alcohol but not overpowering.  Good value for the whole meal.\\n\\nThe second visit was on a Sunday evening for dinner.  We ordered a couple of cocktails (came out much faster than the first trip) which were nicely balanced and flavorful.  Instead of apps or starters we ordered the mussles/fries to split and the Sunday chicken dinner to split as well.  This was not a low-cal meal by any stretch, and despite both being heavy on fats (blue cheese and fries w/ the mussles and of course...fried chicken with Old Bay mac & cheese (Baltimore in the house!) and spicy green beens) neither were greasy nor left you with hint of a coating in the mouth that you can get from a dish prepared with old/low quality frying oil.  A pairing of a couple of glasses of Prosecco were the right match to cut through the fat/salt/heat of the dishes.  I wouldn't have minded a few more green beans on the plate but they were indeed cooked perfectly and the chiles gave a nice heat.\\n\\nBoth times we had very pleasant servers that were attentive, contributed to our selections, and specifically thanked us for coming in.

This is the second time I have been here and the first time was decent so I decided to splurge ($26 for a pizza is not uncommon here) and come back again when some family and i were looking to get some good pizza. We got a margarita pizza, which they call the serenity and add spinach, a pepper and onion with pepperoni on half, and a cheese pizza.\\n\\n          The crust was decent. We went with the wheat dough because when I had it the first time i came here it was crispy and chewy like it should be, unlike most wheat dough that is just thick and spongy. This time the dough was exactly what I didn't want it to be. It was a super thick crust which tells me the dough was not properly spread out. it was close to half an inch thick. If i wanted greek pizza I could have paid ten bucks per pizza. This dough could not have been freshly made if it was the same recipe they used the last time I was there. \\n\\n           On the serenity/margarita pizza we opted for red sauce instead of the garlic olive oil sauce. Let me just say now that all the pizzas had so much sauce that they were almost not edible. The sauce was thick and pasty like they used straight tomato paste and added way too much italian spice blend. On this pizza it was especially unappetizing because they basically layer the entire pizza with basil, spinach, and 11 small slices of tomato. Then they say on the menu that they use fresh mozzarella on this pizza which they did not. They sprinkled regular shredded mozzarella on a margarita pizza that cost me $23 because they charged me for the red sauce as a topping. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and rarely eats cheese and would normally love something like this as she gets it almost every time we get pizza and even she said it was not good. Hard to mess up a margarita pizza but they did it at the flying saucer on this night.\\n\\n           The pepper onion and pepperoni pizza was much more of the same. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!! The pizza cost me $21 because it was $2 per topping. I didn't count but every slice did not have pepper and onion on it and the half with pepperoni probably had 6 to 8 pepperoni's on it. If you are gonna charge me this much for a pizza give me some toppings please. they probably used less than a quarter of a pepper and an onion on this pizza and were super skimpy on the cheese. Now let me say the good pizza shouldn't have tons of cheese but when you have a half inch of spongy gross crust and an ocean of thick, pasty sauce as I mentioned earlier, it makes it hard to eat a pizza with light cheese and no toppings.\\nthis is my favorite combination on pizza and it is simple. Total disaster. \\n\\n           Now cheese is impossible to mess up. Not at Flying Saucer. All things I already said were the issues. Pools of sauce by the crust, thick crust made with old dough, and not enough cheese. Cover the pizza with cheese if your charging $15 for it. There is no reason for charging that much for a cheese pizza. If you are not buying imported cheese, growing the tomatoes out back, and grinding the wheat daily to make the flour for the dough your just ripping people off. None of this is happening here. Add that to the fact that they told us 35 mins for pickup and the pizza was definitely sitting for a while and it was just a bad experience. \\n\\n           I do not care about paying for quality because I believe that fresh, high quality ingredients make a huge difference when making any dish but when I pay $60 for three pizzas I expect some seriously good pizza. This was not good pizza. If I had not ordered it so late I would have returned it. I still have 1.5 pizzas worth of  slices sitting in the fridge because no one liked the pizza. Good pizza would have been gone in this house. \\n\\n            This place should practice what they preach on the website. This was not New York style pizza, it was not fresh high quality ingredients, and it was not gourmet. It actually will probably end up being garbage because I don't think anyone is eating those extra slices."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my second time coming here and the breakfast was incredible!

It seemed the pasta was just a bit overdone, and was falling apart before the dish was even put together. The alfredo was very blah. It was hard to tell if it was tasty over the overall greasiness of the food. The bits of chicken were actually chicken, and not pieces of chicken patty, but were also overdone. The broccoli was ok, and chopped nicely into smaller pieces, but it wasn't enough to save the dish.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half after, the guy came back with my coffee and soda.

You're coming here for crispy juicy tasty chicken tenders.  Everything else is just a side to the chicken.\\n\\nThe \\"Eats meets West\\" is held true here from the fried chicken standpoint.  After that it's the sides and seasonings that are the \\"Eatsern\\" flair.\\n\\nHere is what we ordered:\\n\\nSalad with Ponko Chicken Ponko Spicy Sauce and Sweet Sesame Dressing on the side:  basically their Ponko (Panko) chicken tenders cut up and placed on top of a salad.  The spicy Ponko sauce was just the right amount of heat.  Probably a medium buffalo style sauce.  Chicken had a nice crunchy outside and juicy/tender inside.  Panko does that, retains crunch.\\n\\nPlate with Ponko Chicken, Ponko Sauce, Ponko Fries, and Potato Salad:  \\nPonko Sauce is basically a mirin and shoyu (soy sauce) base.  Definitely a Japanese flavor staple.  Close to teriyaki sauce.  \\n\\nPonko Fries were pretty good.  Seems to be fried with some Panko as well and seasoned with a blend of sesame, roasted seaweed, etc.  Really good.  \\nPotato salad tastes very much 'classic Japanese' taste.\\n\\nLast was a Kids menu item which you can get grilled or 'Ponko' chicken tenders (choice of sauce as well).  Rice (Japanese style sticky rice), Fries, or something else can't remember.  Comes with a juice box or other drink and baby carrots with ranch.\\n\\nLastly, there is currently only limited bench type seating inside with more tables outside.  They do appear in the process of expanding for more indoor dining.  They also serve beer here too.\\n\\nIf I'm ever in the mood for some fried chicken tenders again, I could see myself stopping by to pick some up."},{"name":"Pi Pizza","address":"409 N Hwy 17/92","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"This place is a hole in the wall place but is great you get 2 free beers with your pizza!!!

It's a hidden gem in the downtown Vancouver area, just outside of the Yaletown core. It has easily become one of my favourite Japanese places to dine at.\\n\\nIt's a smaller place, but it's quite cozy and there's cool artwork to look at. If you are there for the first time, they explain to you how to go through their menu. They add new items from time to time so there's an additional sheet they give you. With daily drink specials, you can't help but come back on different days of the week! Oh, and there is one flat screen TV by the bar. They will usually play Canucks games upon request.\\n\\nThe drinks and food are reasonably priced, and the quality of the food is never sub par. A few items I would recommend trying are the Tuna Garlic Pepper, Ebi Mayo (or Ebi Mayo Japon - looks like they use panko in their batter), and the Alpha's Taco Rice. The seared albacore tuna is unlike anything I've ever had. I am sometimes hesitant to order Ebi Mayo from places I'm not familiar with, simply because they can be over-battered, or the batter can taste really soggy. But the Ebi Mayo here is perfectly battered, and the ebi are a decent size. My favourite dish of all here is the Alpha's Taco Rice. Yes, it is exactly what you would imagine it to be. Surprisingly though, it's not fusion, and the dish is quite popular in Okinawa, Japan. Their sauce is what binds all the ingredients together. Before serving, remember to mix everything together so the sauce is evenly incorporated.\\n\\nIn addition to the food/drink selection and prices, the service is also quite impressive.

My biggest suggestion is to avoid this tourist trap: in the same amount of wasting time you can see a part of the city and enjoy other places that are definitely better than this joke."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm in love with the pho-bowl--I get it for the low-low! I absolutely adoooore Pho Pasteur Boston. I'm on the edge of giving 5 stars, because I am literally addicted, but their pho migrates from between pretty good and really freaking great. Granted, pho broth is an evolving concoction, so the flavor changes based on how long it has been simmering. It usually takes several hours (or overnight) to create, so depending on where you land in the lifespan of the particular batch you are served, it is just expected to have slight variations in taste. My personal favorite seems to be when I come dine anytime before noon on any given day. But even later in the evening, I've still been satisfied. \\n\\nOther items I've tried: fresh spring rolls (some consider these non-fried rolls to be summer rolls, but no, they're spring rolls).  I prefer the rolls from other parts of the country (I know, I'm always comparing Boston and Dallas, but sorry!) Dallas is home to the 2nd largest Vietnamese community in the US (2nd to Houston) and their spring rolls have an added flavor that I haven't found here in Boston. Boston spring rolls have shredded iceberg lettuce instead of basil. Fried egg rolls (some places call these fried spring rolls) always a pleasant delight when I'm in the mood for their crispy yumminess. BBQ Pork Chop with fried egg is also very flavorful, though a little dry/tough and a huge portion.  Not so dry to stop me from ordering again though, and they offer brown rice!  Definitely big enough to take home half for a 2nd full sized meal. Also, they give a complimentary cup of hot green tea, sometimes without asking, or sometimes you have to ask. Sometimes they also bring ice water right away without asking too. Their coffee with condensed milk (ca fe da, or ca phe da) is not served like you will find elsewhere, which is traditionally brewed at your table with a cup-sized coffee press.  Rather, here you will find it already mixed, so I'm assuming it's mass-brewed in the back.\\n\\nSince I live downtown, I go on kicks and find myself dining here 4 days in a row some weeks. With the weather getting colder I will definitely be stopping by more than I do in the summer when the weather is too muggy to want a hot bowl of anything. \\n\\nService is about standard for a Vietnamese restaurant. Some may call it rude, but I just call it efficient! None of the ritual courtesies expected of American waitstaff like having the server introduce oneself and offer to walk first-time diners through the menu. For those who are unfamiliar, keep your service expectations light and if you don't speak Vietnamese, your experience may vary if you have a specific question about a menu item. Also, the standards for politeness are different in Vietnam than they are here. Many times your entree may arrive before your appetizer. This can be prevented by ordering the appetizer, waiting a bit, then flagging down a server to order your entree. I know, I know, this is uncalled for by American standards, but the food is so good I can't say anything bad about this place! \\n\\nThey're open long hours, 9am-11pm. Lunch rush and dinner rush can be hectic.  Solo diners keep in mind, they do have \\"communal tables\\" (set up like picnic table style, but with regular chairs) so you may be seated with people you don't know. ONCE I did have an interesting seating arrangement where I walked in alone and another guy also walked in alone and they sat us together at a 2-top table. It was like being on the most awkward blind date ever where we both avoided eye contact and he read a newspaper while I played on my phone the entire time. Hey, it's a downtown Boston Vietnamese restaurant. Space is limited when crowds are plentiful, and service standards are... different. Again, all is pho-given when their food is so good."},{"name":"101 Beer Kitchen","address":"817 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Westerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Draft beer selection were okay, not great.

I had never heard of the place, so, as is standard for me, I looked up the menu online. I experienced a slight tingle of fear as I noted one meat filled dish after another. I briefly considered ditching vegetarianism after reading through several of the tasty sounding concoctions and viewing corresponding Yelp photos. But, ultimately, I found a few veggie-friendly pizza options and two sans-chicken salads to choose from.\\n\\nI set off with visions of blue cheese pizza dancing in my head. The wait was long - super long. We left the office at 11:30a and were seated around 1:00p. Granted, we were a 5 top. My blue cheese pizza wasn't on the menu, but I asked the waiter, and he said it was still available. We waited about another half hour before getting our food. The wait was so long that my boss actually had to leave before we even ate so that he could make it to a meeting.\\n\\nBut the food was really, really good. My pizza was crispy, the cheese was succulently sour (in a fermented sense), and the onions were carmelized and sweet. The basket of fries we shared was humongous. The fries were thick-cut, slightly blackened, and accompanied by salt, vinegar, and ketchup. Everyone else at the table got burgers. Thurman's mythically big, big burgers were big, but not as Paul Bunyan big as I had imagined. \\n\\nI agree with whoever said the table fell silent when the food arrived. In fact, it was awkwardly silent. The jukebox had been blaring beforehand, but as soon as our food came out, the songs stopped, and no one was talking because we were all stuffing our faces. Everyone agreed the food was good - heart stopping good. Grease haters, beware.\\n\\nI didn't mind the wait since I'll take any excuse to get out of the office for a while. But there was a pair of flies that incessantly buzzed around our table and repeatedly landed on our heads; that was annoying.\\n\\nThe decor reminds me of a beach dive bar. Everything is makeshift, lots of old wood, TONS of dollar bills taped all over every inch of space and hanging like tassels from the bar rafters. Even the ceiling is painted with old, cardboard Budweiser boxes. \\n\\nThe waitress said the dollar bill thing started when a guy who had been to another dough decked restaurant out of state came in and taped a buck to the wall. Everyone else followed suit, many writing messages or drawing pictures on the green papers. The original restaurant touted $35,000 in dollar bill decorations. I asked the bartender how much they thought was hanging around in Thurman's, she said she didn't know but invited me back to count it sometime. What I kept wondering was what keeps people from untaping the bills from the walls and stuffing them into their pockets?"},{"name":"Greenhills Traditional Irish Bakery","address":"780 Adams St","city":"Dorchester Center","stars":"4","text":"This place is absolute heaven.

We managed to get dinner reservations and were seated pretty promptly after arriving.\\n\\nTwo friends and I shared the pasta platter which includes the kobe meatballs with spaghetti, spicy penne, and canneloni.  Others had the meatballs/spaghetti on their own, and the gnocchi.\\n\\nThe kobe meatballs were very tasty but a little bit dry, as were the cannelonis.  The spicy penne available on the combination pasta platter was probably my favourite, it was cooked just right and had nice bright flavours.\\n\\nWhat was an interesting touch was that they gave an amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal.  The night we went it was a cheesy risotto.  The cheese flavour was very good (not overpowering but still flavourful) but the risotto was a little on the crunchy side.  I don't really eat a lot of risotto so it's hard for me to judge.  I guess the Asian part of me just doesn't really like crunchy rice.\\n\\nI would give them a second try, maybe to try the gnocchi?\\n\\nService, as others have mentioned, was excellent throughout the night.\\n\\nA side note: as a trendy place it's very noisy!  I had to go outside to take a phone call because I had no hope of making out what the other person was saying and was accosted by a passerby who lurched towards me with a \\"Wanna talk to me??!?!!!\\"  and then shouted \\"Fine then run away!!!!\\" when I scurried away from his advances back towards the door of the restaurant.

Of course, it was much longer than that so by the time they beeped us, we had already secured our spot at the bar and had ordered some food.

He worked alone (he obviously needed no wingman), dropped names like they were hot, impressed us with both his former professional athleticism (which may have been BS because all my Google searches have come up empty) as well as his business acumen, shamed our attempts at style by mentioning that he had to have his shirts custom-made and that he was just at Hermes earlier in the day, and complained about how difficult it was for him now because he was still just so damn big and muscular despite only doing \\"casual\\" workouts.  It got to be fun - I could openly ask questions like what car did he drive, how much money did he make, which top shelf liquor did he prefer the most.  But then he made the critical and miscalculated error of inviting both of us back to his place to \\"hang out\\" resulting in a cold rebuff, which meant that he had to move on and try to impress someone else.

It's been around for a long time, I think approaching a decade.  Traffic in the area can suck, especially during peak times, but it's a not a bad a place to stop for a quick bite to eat.  The meals are usually fresh, filling, and can be healthy depending on what you order.\\n\\nChipotle is known for its burritos and competes locally against the likes of Moe's and Willy's.  I personally like Willy's the best for a variety of reasons.  Among them are better tasting burritos and chips and I'm a fan of their salsa bar.  However, Chipotle is fine and I like their use of all-natural ingredients.\\n\\nThe beef, pork, and chicken are sourced from farms that naturally raise their livestock and don't use antibiotics or hormones.  Despite the higher quality meats, Chipotle's burritos are still priced competitively, between $6-7 each.  I do think Moe's and Willy's burritos are bigger, but bigger isn't always necessarily better.  Sometimes, I think Moe's burritos are too big.\\n\\nChipotle's menu is simple, but highly customizable.  Like the other burrito joints, the kitchen and ingredients are laid out before the customers in an assembly-line format.  You can pick and choose the ingredients go into your burrito, burrito bowl, tacos, or salad, and watch your meal come together.  I usually spring for a burrito or burrito bowl.  Burrito bowls are exactly like burritos except without the tortilla.  Same ingredients and same price.\\n\\nThe burrito tortillas are made of flour.  My favorite meats are steak and barbacoa (spicy beef).  I've tried the carnitas (pork) and it's okay -- the batch I had at this location probably wasn't seasoned enough.  I'd be willing to try it again.  The steak and barbacoa are usually pretty tender, particularly the barbacoa, which is shredded.  Both have a smoky flavor and the barbacoa is mildly spicy.  Nothing the red chili salsa can't fix.\\n\\nDifferent rice and bean options are available.  Brown rice is there for those who want to eat healthy.  I think the pinto beans, cooked with bacon, taste better than the black beans.  For about $2 and change, you can get extra meat, but I've tried this before and don't think it's worth it.  Also, chips cost extra, which is whack.  The chips at Moe's and Willy's are free.\\n\\nService is usually fast and efficient and is reasonable during peak times.  The store is clean and spacious and there's sufficient parking."},{"name":"Cafe Allegro","address":"12386 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"This is not the first time we have been here, nor will it be the last.   This particular trip was precipitated by our wedding anniversary combined with a Living Social voucher that was about to expire.   \\n\\nI called in advance to ask if they took reservations and they said only for parties of six or more.   We arrived shortly after 7pm and were seated about 20 minutes later.   For a Saturday night, that is pretty typical in the area.    As we walked through the entire restaurant (in the ten years I have been dining here I don't think I have ever been seated so far back in the restaurant) we noticed that while they were busy, they had quite a few empty tables and surmised that the wait was due to the fact that they didn't have enough employees working to seat people more quickly.   \\n\\nOnce we were seated, the service was good.   Water was brought promptly and the person who brought the water barely had time to finish telling us that our waitress would be with us shortly, before she had arrived.  Our food was served promptly and well timed.    We were checked back on a few times, but were left to linger quite a while after the check came before they came to cash us out.  \\n\\nI admit that I almost always order the same thing when I eat here, so I made a cursory review of the menu to make sure there wasn't something new I needed to try before settling on my standard jalapeno shrimp linguine.   (When we started eating here is was jalapeno shrimp tri-linguine, but alas, the noodles are now all one color).   I also had a Caesar salad as a starter.   My husband ordered the exact same thing.\\n\\nNow, i say we ordered the exact same thing, but they didn't necessarily appear the same.    My salad had exactly half of a crouton on it, while his had a good handful of them.  This was not really an issue, as I am not a big fan of croutons, but it was noticeable.   The same was true of the linguine.   I rarely, if ever, add salt to my food but I noticed that my husband kept reaching for the salt shaker.   I looked at his plate and noticed that his linguine seemed to be swimming in sauce while mine had just taken a nice bath in it.   Noticing this himself, he asked if he could take a taste of mine and he said that mine tasted different than his did.   They were both jalapeno shrimp, but it did appear that they had been sauced from different sources.

We got there right before it began to fill up. My dad picked this restaurant. We were seated very quickly and the tea came almost immediately after. Within a 10 minute time frame, we were asked three separate times if we were ready to order. We ordered a sashimi plate, BBQ squid, BBQ mackerel, a few rolls and an ikura nigiri (dad's fave) once we were ready.\\n\\nThe server brought out a different sashimi plate than we had originally ordered. I didn't realize until we were a few pieces in. We didn't relay this information back to the servers because the restaurant was gradually filling up and they looked rather busy. The sashimi was fresh. I'm actually glad we got the sashimi plate we didn't origanally order because the other one wouldn't have filled us. Everything was good but my dad noted the ikura was saltier than it should be. \\n\\nThe service is very prompt and servers are friendly.

I've now had it 3 times in one month and it has exceeded my expectations each time.  It's in the center of Chinatown amongst a million other restaurants but I can't imagine that this one isn't one of the best in the area.  The atmosphere is strange, a lot of bamboo and other hokey decorations, but most importantly it is very clean and the kitchen is open and in plain view.   The food tastes incredibly fresh and is not greasy.  The service was very good each time- even during a weekday lunch when it was very busy.  They have a ton of fun drinks such as fruit smoothies, (try the mango-amazing) milk teas, and delicious homemade lemonade.  Enough of that let's get to the food.  It's so good.  It is my personal belief that you can tell rat hole from a delectable restaurant by trying the fried rice.  The fried rice from here is so amazing.  They use only fresh vegetables, seafood and meat and everything was flavorful and light.  My personal favorite main dish on the menu is the Thai Basil chicken, which comes in a brown sauce with red and green pepper, sliced white meat chicken, sweet thai basil, and chili.  It's somewhat spicy but didn't burn my mouth off.  The lemongrass chicken is also a good one.  Also, you must try the white rice here.  It's not just any white rice.  It's infused with jasmine and it is so light, fluffy and buttery you can eat it plain.  After my 3rd visit in short succession I'm convinced this place can do no wrong.  \\n\\nThis place is almost too good to be true.  Amazing food, affordable prices, and decent service.  It's new and owned by the same people who own Bao' Bao's Bakery across the street (another great spot might I add).

We ordered the Fry Toupee and Sergeant Pepper burgers on their summer menu (it was also BOGO 50% off for burgers bc it was a Wednesday), and I upgraded for $2 to a side of mac and my boyfriend got the vampire fries for an additional $1.\\n\\nBoth burgers were pretty large and cooked exactly the way we wanted them. They were a bit messy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (maybe just not first date-esque)! The vampire fries were definitely not worth the extra dollar, and to be honest I have no idea what made them different than the regular fries other than the light amount of garlic added to them. The mac and cheese was nothing extraordinary but still tasty and I added hot sauce to it (per usual).\\n\\nWe both had two beers one of which was the Barefoot Wit. This is a super light beer and personally I usually order lighter beers but this one almost didn't taste like beer at all. I enjoyed my second beer more but seem to forget which one it was!\\n\\nWe sat on the bar side that was outdoors, and the bartender serving us was really friendly and helpful with recommendations which is always a plus for me because I'm so indecisive when it comes to new restaurants. My only complaint was that it took awhile to receive our food, and the sides to the burgers were very average.

Everyone was really nice to us it is a family run business and has been around 50yrs or more.  The menu is very impressive and the prices are really not bad for what they are giving you.  We decided to try the crazy Thurmanator just so we could say we tried it.  If you look through all the pictures on here you can see why I call this burger crazy as it is basically two of their burgers (the Thurman burger and the Western burger to be exact) that are put together between 1 bun.  I tell you this we had them cut it in half for us and I couldn't even eat half of my half of the burger and you can't pick it up you have to use a knife and fork, but you can pick up the bottom half and have some of that and then the top half, lol.  I expected their fries to be better as they look similar to the ones I make at home.  The fries were not that good and I hope it is just the batch we got this time because I assure you we will be going back to this awesome little bar.  The menu is crazy big with so many burgers to choose from and I saw a lot of people getting just normal burgers and those are huge enough.

I think I died and went to Heaven!  Just to add some credibility to my review, my love affair with pizza started as a child and has only grown with time.  When I was little I ate so much of it that my mom warned me that I was going to turn into a piece of pizza.  Not to be discouraged, I pressed on throughout adulthood to patron as many wonderful pizza establishments as I could, and here I am, reviewing the latest on the Portland scene.  Admittedly, I never made it to the beloved Lovely Hula Hands (RIP), but when I heard the business was trying their hand at a new pizza place, I was more than thrilled!  \\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nThe Mississippi Area is one of the coolest neighborhoods in Portland, and Lovely's is located here, directly next store to the old Lovely Hula Hands building (which I heard they still own and will be leasing to a new restaurant...what will it be?).  The interior of Lovely's has clean lines and all wooden furniture, with a very relaxed, \\"zen\\" vibe.  It felt warm and cozy.  Diner style seating, with booths on one side and smaller tables on the other.  They had a good crowd for a rainy Sunday evening, but we were able to grab a table back by the \\"kitchen,\\" an open area where you can watch your order be prepared (pizza is hand-tossed).  Bathrooms are located next door, so you have to get a key and walk outside to get there, which is kind of a pain.  \\n\\nFood/Wine:\\nThe salad options are sprawling and have some great combinations.  We started with the \\"Gene's beets with grapefruit, avocado, cilantro & calabrian chilies.\\"  While the dish was light and refreshing, the portion size was lacking for $8.  There was probably one beet cut into ten pieces and  1/2 an avocado in thin slices...disappointing.  \\n\\nThe pizza options are also well crafted, and we splurged and tried two different pies.  First was the red chard, rapini & fennel sausage, and second was the wild nettles with salumi pancetta.  Neither stuck out as better than the other, so I will speak in more general terms.  The greens were a bit too charred for my taste, but the meat on both pizzas was delicious.  Perfectly juicy sausage and salty, thinly sliced salumi pancetta.  The crust was nicely browned and had great consistency, but lacked any sort of flavor.\\n\\nI enjoyed the smaller size of the pizzas (perfect for a light meal for two people), but at $15, they should be larger.\\n\\nNice selection of wines, however we could not find anything under $25.  Our bottle of Chianti was the perfect accompaniment to this meal, but I do wish they had at least a couple of $20 options.\\n\\nIce Cream:\\nFrom what I can tell, the flavors change pretty frequently because they are homemade.  We split the two-scoop bowl for $5, and we chose the Malted Milk Ball and Mint Stracciatella.  Both were creamy and flavorful, with perfect texture.  My only complaint was that the portions were small, tiny  1/2 cup servings of each.\\n\\nPricing/Service:\\nAs you can tell, I thought Lovely's Fifty-Fifty was overpriced.  When you compare it to the outstanding pizza establishments in Portland (namely Ken's, Apizza Scholls, Dove Vivi) it definitely doesn't give the most bang for the buck.  Prices are higher and portions are noticeably smaller.  \\n\\nService was friendly and attentive.  In chatting with the waitress they seem happy to be in their new space, and business sounded like it was going well.\\n\\nOverall, this is a place any pizza lover would enjoy, to be sure.

The mignonette served on the side add's such a refreshing bite that really compliments the sweet and briny nature of the oyster. \\n\\nFor our entree's, I ordered the tuna ribbons salad, similar to a nicoise. This salad is so incredibly fresh and delicious I cant even begin to explain. If you like fresh raw tuna, this salad is where its at. The aioli style dressing included on the dish adds such a depth to all the ingredients, tying the eggs, greens, haricot vert, , capers and tuna together perfectly. He ordered the vitello tonnato, a sandwich of epic proportion. Holy sandwich. The bread is a texas toast style, toasted perfectly and stuffed with the most luscious tuna tartare and layered with roasted veal. Its then topped with a crunchy cucumber salad and mustard sauce to boot. The play on the classic italian dish, traditionally served as a veal cutlet topped with a tuna sauce, is phenominal to say the least. If my friend wasn't going to order the sandwich this time, you better believe that I would have gladly done so. The contrast in flavors and textures is enough to make my mouth water but the execution of this sandwich is flawless. I highly recommend trying it.

This place has a cool, artsy vibe. When you come in, you're welcomed by a spacious open dining area and high ceilings with plenty of bar seating. The walls displayed local artists' works, which I was informed changes quarterly. There were music videos being projected on the walls for some ambience music, and the place was packed with patrons who seemed to really be enjoying the food and company. \\nThe waitstaff was very welcoming and helpful in making suggestions for a first-timer. Being a vegetarian, I was worried I wouldn't have too many options, but the owner personally came by and made recommendations which turned out to be amazing. The owner/chef was very personable, welcoming, and took the time to chat.  \\nI ordered the vegetable boil which had a spicy garlic sauce and was the right amount of spicy and savory. I had a red wine which was really smooth - I don't even know what it was but it agreed with my palate. We also ordered the Mac and cheese w/o crawfish (although I hear it's amazing for those non-vegetarians) and it was a pretty darn good mac and cheese. I also couldn't stop nibbling on the sweet potato fries, which are cut very skinny so it's perfectly crispy. Salad was a good combination of textures and flavors.\\nWith the Boil dishes, a bib clip and vinyl gloves with alcohol wipes are provided to allow you to eat in true Louisiana style. All the meals seem perfect for sharing, as I saw the tables around me doing. People stayed for awhile, enjoying their meal.\\nLast but not least, the dessert: we chose the banana fosters beignet, which came with a scoop of ice cream. Omg, so good. Must order. \\nI was so full, but the food was so good that I wanted to take all the leftovers home to enjoy again later.\\nI immediately made plans to get some friends to plan for their weekend brunch - I hear they have the only souffl√© pancake in town. \\nSo overall, it was a great dining experience and I would definitely recommend to friends."},{"name":"Violette Gluten Free Bakery","address":"1786 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I are quite perplexed by the high ratings this place has received. We had a pretty sub-par experience there a few weeks ago. From the staff to the execution, we left the place pretty annoyed and regretting our decision to set foot in this place to begin with.\\n\\nWe went there on a weekday, in the middle of the afternoon after finding street parking a block or two away and walked over. It took us a second to find the entrance, which happens to be below street level, under a yoga studio. We proceeded inside and found a fairly busy place. They were a few people scattered in front of the counter and a few other sitting at various tables by the window. \\n\\nWe proceeded to get into what seemed like a line but quickly realized that there isn't such a thing there. It's complete chaos, and there's a complete lack of organization from the staff. They were overwhelmed, slow and not all that friendly. There was only one woman behind the counter, and there were about 5-6 people in front of us. It took nearly 25 minutes for us to be able to finally get to select our treats. \\n\\nSpeaking of treats, their disorganized counter also has a self-serve portion where they'll have the patrons to stick their hands into the various glass cake domes to select our treats. Not very sanitary all things considered... \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our turn in the incredibly slow line, another staff member was pulling one of those wheeled carts and rammed it right into me. They came from behind me and pretty much never said 'excuse me' or anything else and just decided to sneak up and I'm guessing assumed I was going to move over even though I had no idea where they were going or that they were behind me. I almost fell over and heard no apology. This almost happened again a few minutes later, but they, this time around, muttered a 'coming through' sentence which was barely audible. I was baffled...\\n\\nEventually our turn came, and the very slow, nonchalant and unapologetic staff member took care of my wife's order. We asked for recommendations and when asked if they had anything that they were famous for or that would be a highlight the said that 'everything was good'. How helpful. We settled on getting 4-5 items including a congo bar, a couple of cupcakes and a few other things and paid. \\n\\n\\nThe layout of the counter, which is awkwardly packed with items, makes it very hard to easily dodge people and pay, while trying not to knock over anything. We eventually managed and left. Upon getting to the car, we broke open our box and tried a couple of things and saved the rest for later. Everything we had was very forgettable and borderline dry. We were far from impressed and liked the items over at Glutenus Minimus in Belmont much better. We would be hard pressed to return here as the quality of the customer service and the baked good were both very underwhelming. Especially the former.

The bun, bacon, and toppings were very good.\\n\\nIt came with a side; I chose salad, and it was a very good fresh green salad, with my chosen honey mustard dressing being the star: tasted like homemade.

My friend had the North End Ciopinno - lots of fish and seafood, in a very tasty and somewhat spicy broth.  We'd highly recommend all of the dishes.  Neptune has a pretty good drink list, and you'll likely be able to find something that pairs well with whatever you decide to eat. \\n\\nSo with all of the positive things out of the way, here are a few things to be aware of: \\n\\n- Get there early or pick an off-peak time to visit.  The day we were able to successfully get a seat we still waited two hours.  \\n- The restaurant is tiny and you must be comfortable sitting in close proximity to others.  Do not expect any privacy.

Decided to change it last night and setup a reservation. Desperately needed to try something new in this city.\\n\\nMy core impressions on the food and the service were overall positive. It was very traditional and unique, I loved that about the establishment. There is a sense of stepping into another world. It felt like a family establishment. The lamb shank was quite tasty, meat quality was about average, but preparation was great. The appetizers were delicious, especially the eggplant spread. The bread served with the food wasn't as fresh as I hoped for it to be, but fine. The chicken kebab was on the dry side, but good. People were simply wonderful here. \\n\\nNow, these are the reasons why I am not likely to return. The prices are exorbitant for no reason. It's simple, good traditional food, charging this much money for it is just nuts. The price is comparable to a gastronomic restaurant, which incurs extremely high expenses on equipment and time to revolutionize understanding of food. This was traditional, well prepared dishes at Imperial Fez, so price is just insane. \\n\\nThe drinks, both quality and options are not good either. Moscow mule was basically simple syrup and vodka, didn't even finish it, only took a sip. That is not how a Moscow mule is made. No good wine options either. Seriously, not a single good wine on the menu. The bottles that were there were up charged about 3-4 times, which is ridiculous for a restaurant. Concrete example, selling Coppola for around $45 bucks. It's a $10-13 bottle of wine at a store! These elements were frustrating. Basically, cant have a good drink here.\\n\\nLastly, no hookah in the restaurant area is a bit disappointing, although I can understand that some would complain. \\n\\nI will come back to my main point, I loved the people here. They were extremely kind and made some wonderful food, even staying late while we finished. I can't say I will return here given the pricing and drinks, but I do wish them luck and hopefully this feedback is helpful."},{"name":"Culinary Delights","address":"229 N Main St","city":"Natick","stars":"4.5","text":"The best Chicago dogs eat of the windy city.

When I went to Le Pigeon I couldn't bring myself to make one of the courses the burger so I vowed to come back. From what I hear, the burger at Little Bird is supposed to be identical to the Le Pigeon burger. Since this place is larger and more convenient, I opted to eat it here. Little Bird is still quite small, but probably twice the size of its parent. There are three seating options, main floor, bar, and upstairs. I was surprised when the host asked if we had a reservation for lunch, this was a first in Portland. Luckily it wasn't very crowded and the two of us were sat immediately.  \\n\\nI found the seating situation at Little Bird to be much better than Le Pigeon. It didn't have the cool open kitchen with bar seats, but it also didn't have that cramped communal table that required the outside seats to get up every time someone wanted to got o the bathroom. I found the service to be just as good as Le Pigeon. Drinks were filled promptly, my napkin was folded when I went to the bathroom, and the staff all wore matching, but not identical, clothing that complimented the feel of the restaurant. \\n\\nBoth my partner and I ordered just the burger so this review is only covering that one item. He got his medium and I ordered mine rare. Both burgers came out in a timely manner and were served with a side of fries, house made katsup, and a knife to cut the burger with. The burger was a good size and topped with over-sized lettuce, griddled onions and peppers, blue cheese, house sauce, and was on a toasted brioche bun.  Both our burgers were cooked to the preparedness we requested, however my bottom bun was burned on one side. The griddled onions and peppers were sublime. They soaked up all the flavor of the meat and just melted into my mouth with every bite. The blue cheese was strong and pungent, but neither overwhelmed the meat nor was overwhelmed by the meat. Too often there is too little or too much cheese, this was just perfect. The lettuce was a bit much though. It was just so large and sauce slathered, it made eating the burger a messy ordeal.  The fries were also pretty disappointing. They came with no salt so I had to flag a waiter to get some. They were also cold and a bit soggy. Not sure if they were sitting out while the burger was being made or what. Call me a philistine, but I'll take Heinz over the house ketchup next time.\\n\\nAt $12 for a burger and fries at one of the fanciest restaurants in Portland, this is a great deal .

Both are star attractions, with a special mention to the Foie Gras br√ªl√©e on the board being creamy, sweet and salty perfection.

Being a New Englander, I have to admit that we have pretty high expectations when it comes to our seafood. Maybe it is my fault that I decide to order a fried oyster appetizer, but lesson learned.\\n\\nPrice is certainly decent on the ribs and most of the items we ordered with the exceptions of the Fried Oyster.

The inattentive service and very slow delivery of our food made for one of the poorer dining experiences I have had in a while. Once the food was delivered it was not exactly what I would call spectacular. It was not bad, but I was scratching my head wondering what everyone was raving about?\\n\\nWe were lucky enough to get a table without waiting by showing up early on a Saturday night, and the initial impressions were positive, with a warm greeting and a nice feel inside once you get past the strange industrial park location. The prices are reasonable and they have a good selection of dishes. Chips and salsa promptly delivered to our table to tide us over until our waitress came. The salsa was more authentic Mexican style, and thus on the watery side. It was good, but I like my salsa more solid and chunky. \\n\\nThe slowness problems started with our waitress, who was clearly overworked servicing too many tables. It took her a while to get to us to take our order and then she did not come around once until our food came. And since the food delivery took a very long time, this was pretty unacceptable. So much so that I was getting annoyed and I was a bit miffed that two tables seated after us got their orders before us. Even then it took a while before we got our food after those other tables. It was almost like our order got lost. The guacamole that we intended to have as an appetizer never made it, even with our meal, and since our waitress never came by there was no chance to ask for it. I tracked her down to request it and she promptly rectified it but there was no apology for her mistake. \\n\\nI ordered a combination with two chicken enchiladas and tamale. When the food finally did arrive, the presentation was unimpressive, with no garnishment of any kind, and this particular combo did not include rice and beans that is pretty standard at any other Mexican restaurant. The enchiladas were stuffed with nothing but chicken, with no other apparent spices or ingredients, with the tastes only coming from the overly generous smothering of ranchero sauce, which did not quite work, and the tamale was not very flavorful and had an overly hard texture."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is somewhere between a 3.5 and a 4.25; great food, terrible wait.\\n\\nThis location is busy, and busy often.

We ordered:\\n\\n- Burger\\n- Apple brined pork chop\\n\\nThe pork chop was ok, nothing special, but the burger was delicious. The caveat: the burger was expensive (I can't remember exactly, but I want to say $18, which is crazy for a burger). Even with that price tag hanging over my head, I really enjoyed the burger. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, everything about it was spot on. Even with the wait, tight space and price, I would still consider going back for that burger it was that good.\\n\\nGood for stopping in once and maybe more than once if you find an off time to go.

I was surprised at the knowledge of our waitress and she helped me pick out some great choices.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal my friend and I still had a full beer to finish off but we had to get going.

So off we went!\\n\\nI love this place. Do not be like me and skip it because it seems like something you can get at home. The menu is delicious, service is outstanding and dining outside by the water was peaceful, relaxing and beautiful.\\n\\nMy one recommendation is to use caution when dining with children inside the pub. Outside on the deck was no issue. But when I dined at night I took a walk around the inside of the restaurant by the pub and it was a pretty rowdy bar scene in there.
