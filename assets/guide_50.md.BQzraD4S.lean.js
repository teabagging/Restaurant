Pot likker is a real treat, they give you a small sampling of the broth off the turnip greens with corn bread cracklins. It leaves you wanting more so we order a side of turnip greens with our meal. I doubt there is any selection you could go wrong with. We loved the chicken and dumplings, pork roast, and couldn't pass up the fried chicken. You must try the fried chicken!

The sauces are unique but pretty good. But I don't like their bread for they were not hot and crispy. \\n- 1/2 dozen oysters: 3 different kinds from West Coast, East Coast. They also came with 3 different additions of chalaquita, rabano-mango and nikkei salsas to pair with the oyster. The mango salsa was my favorite. \\n- Choros A La Chalaca - mussels cooked i white wine topped with corn & tomato salsa. Mussels were very fresh. I like it. \\n- Palta Rellena De Cangrejo - avocado stuffed with crab, topped with a poached prawn. I thought this dish was a perfect combination. OMG. Everything comes together so well. Genius! \\n- Conchas A La Parrilla - grilled scallop with tamari-brown sugar butter sauce and crispy onions. The scallop was huge and perfectly grilled with a very nice touch of brown sugar butter. It was absolutely delicious! \\n- A La Chalaca - Sashimi -style fresh fish served with corn salsa. The fish came out in thick cut, very fresh and high quality. Of course, these are not quite the sashimi that you would have from a Japanese restaurant. This dish has its uniqueness and again very quality. But I have always been a fan of Japanese sashimi, so I wasn't very impressed with this. \\n- Fish Ceviche - this is claimed to be their iconic dish. So of course, this is a must-have dish. Again, I thought the fish was very fresh and high quality. \\n- Coderito De Los Andes - double rack of lamb with Peruvian potato. The server knew we were sharing everything, so he had the kitchen split the dish into 2 plates. It was very thoughtful of him! The 2 plates were brought out as if we had ordered 2 entrees. The lamb was perfectly grilled to medium (or medium well). The meat was still very juicy and a lil bit pink inside. The sauce complimented very well with the meat and Peruvian potato.

A delicious, deceptively adequately proportioned, and might I add, very healthy meal. \\n\\nWhat I thought:\\nThe presentation was totally cute, square ( I love square presentation ) but looked small. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food. This turned out to be a very unrealistic fear. \\n\\nTo start, the food was absolutely amazing. The flavor of the baked scramble was so strong and perfect. The trout was fresh and flavorful and the toast was full of delicious grains. The potato pancakes were the icing on the cake though. A very subtle flavor with the right a mount of seasoning made this little starch a perfect lunch / breakfast treat. Not only was it filling, it was also super tasty. It's also pretty yummy with some Chalula Hot Sauce, though I only ate one bite this way.\\n\\nThe overall is, This place is cozy, small, square, and delicious. The wait staff is mega friendly, the cooks are too. They have sugar cubes for your coffee convenience and the atmosphere is dim and relaxing.

Considering all the standing around it surprised us that it took us so long to be greeted but once we were the server was very polite and competent. He did not even give us a hard time with the Groupon (which always blows my mind as the goal should be to wow us into being repeat guests instead of treating us as an annoyance) and explained that we could combine the included value for alcohol toward anything we liked.\\n\\nSo we ordered the Sangria pitcher and it was very good. The bread was also very enjoyable with the oil and garlic dip. The appetizer we ordered, the bruchetta caprese, was good but not great.  The bread was a little soggy when it should have been crispy and the cheese was lacking. The dishes came from the kitchen at a fairly good speed. The big winner entree was the ravioli terracina which was good but the sauce was less creamy that it could have been. The ahi tuna was just an ok tuna steak that didn't seem to go with the pasta but it seemed out of place on the menu anyway.\\n\\nThe one thing the server did not do was tell us that an automatic gratuity was being applied. The Groupon does not specify that, only stating the generic reminder to tip based on the pre discount amount.

What's really cool is that they give you a sheet to write down your order, which makes life way easier.\\n\\nChicken Fried Chicken: love their breading. I regret ordering it almost immediately because the portion was so big and also it was a little dry. Nevertheless, it was still good. \\n\\nFour Piece Chicken: this was probably the best dish and my boyfriend got this one. It was perfectly breaded, juicy, and it was to die for. It came with a thigh, a wing, a breast, and a drumstick. \\n\\nMac & cheese: unlike any others that I've had. Very, very cheesy but addicting.\\n\\nWhipped potatoes: very bland. Not a huge fan.\\n\\nSweet corn: tasty! May be a little too sweet for others. \\n\\nVegetable medley: steamed perfectly. Could use a little seasoning though. \\n\\nOverall, the experience was great. The service was outstanding. I'll probably come back the next time I'm in town again. Don't forget to get the brownie sundae before you leave! :)"},{"name":"Tre'za","address":"804 Town Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Pizza is okay, not anywhere as good as Antico or Tartufo, though in fairness it is a lower price point than those places.  For me, the crust is not anything special.  I think the toppings are good.  Gelato is very good.  We have had some issues with Treza getting our order wrong or delaying in making the pizza.  The staff has always been friendly and well-intentioned, but there seem to be more mistakes than there should be (I've been there about 6 times, so a decent sample size).  I also do not recall seeing anyone there who looks like a manager.

I felt really bad but I didn't want to pay for a meal that I wasn't going to eat (it was that bad) so I sent it back.  Not 30 seconds later the owner came bustling up to my table holding my dish demanding an explanation.  I was very respectful and apologized for the inconvenience but stated that it was of very poor quality.  She and the other waitress got very angry and started yelling at me, in front of the entire restaurant, saying that I was wrong.  I then told them that I would tell all my friends not to go there and this really set them off.  As soon as they brought the check back they yelled for us to leave and never return.  I made it quite clear that leaving and never returning would be no problem.  They also made fun of me to other customers...sooo unprofessional and rude.  I was completely humiliated.  So to sum it up: the food was awful, the service disgusting, and the over-all experience abysmal.  Please, if you have any sense DO NOT GO TO THAI NOODLE HOUSE.

Well, the cooks managed to accomplish the impossible. They put the beef on a slice of bread drenched in some kind of oil and fat, it was just absolutely horrible. You should probably get your heart checked after eating this and your mind checked if you get this twice in a row.\\n\\n- DUCK - they didn't ask how I want my duck cooked and made the assumption that I will want it extra rare. The duck breast that was brought out was completely red, I mean, you couldn't have cooked it less. For those who are frequent duck eaters, you will know that it's not the most tender of meats, but highly flavorful. Given the very rare preparation (I am tempted to say \\"raw\\"), I couldn't even eat it because it was so hard to chew. Sure, id love to thank the chef for a jaw workout, but unfortunately I didn't sign up for one.\\n\\n- SLOW SERVICE was the last strand. The service was courteous and attentive, but took a very long time for the food to come out. You'd think the way they cooked that duck, it would only take a few minutes to get that thing from farm to table.\\n\\n- VALET - not only did I have to wait for a while to get the car parked due to a long line, but I had to pay $2? Are you guys kidding? I mean, what kind of joke is this that I have to be nickel and dimed when coming to a nice restaurant. Absolutely ridiculous and really says a lot about the restaurant. Given that the tab per person with alcohol can easily come out to $100, they should be able to absorb a $2 valet cost without looking like I am parking my car at a cheap motel."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places for ramen in Boston!

I told the waitress I couldn't eat the meal and the waitress responded \\"So you just don't want the food touching?\\" And I had to explain, for about the third time that I don't eat pork. The staff proceeded to take the meal from the table to behind the counter, take the ham out and put the turkey bacon I had ordered into the meal.

Gracie's came highly recommended online so we thought we'd give it a try. 2 stars are purely for service (5star service, 0 Star food), food at Taco Bell would have been better. \\n\\nOur waitress was excellent and so was front of house, unfortunately the C team must have been working the kitchens since the A team probably got the holiday off. \\n\\nStarted off dinner with the pumpkin soup, which was excellent. However when the main , lamb rack, came out things went downhill quickly. As you can see from the attached photo 2/3 of my meal was fat. I spent a good 35m trying to take fat off my lamb. I believed they forgot to fully French the lamb, and a huge layer of fat started off on top of the rack. From there it was layer after layer of fat with a mouthful of hard won lamb in between.  My boyfriend got the prime rib, which was better, but again looking at the photo a good portion of that was fat. I don't know if it was because of the late dinner time, but it felt like no care was taken with selecting the pieces of meat nor was there quality control. \\n\\nDessert was a bit more successful, or I was so hungry from the lack of an entree you could have given me wheatgrass juice and I would have thought that was excellent  so got the sticky toffee pudding and devoured it as I was so hungry. I believe it was decent quality, but nothing special. My boyfriend got the pavlova. This was much less successful. The meringue was overly sweet and was piped on quite thickly. The blood orange custard was an artificial orange color and also overly sweet. If you've never had pavlova before or you're fond of super sweet desserts, this was passable.\\n\\nAll in all, I was not impressed. At $75 per person you'd expect quality, but instead got meat that was lower quality than select grade meat at Walmart.

I actually had been reflecting the other day that Hall Street needed to step up their game if they wanted to stay competitive. And boy did they!\\n\\nMy first visit to Hall Street Grill was probably about six years ago. It was a fancy, yet merely \\"OK\\" dinner for us. The wife to be was (at the time,) in a hardcore vegan mood so the meal was less then enjoyable for both of us. Her choices on the menu were not only limited, they were pretty much non-existent and took a bit of modification at the kitchen level. Mine were technically more numerous, but in some ways just as limited as I'm not a seafood fan.\\n\\nAfter that, we ended up using Hall Street as an OK happy hour destination for the next four years or so. While not ideal, it was still a better choice then other places only a few blocks away. We avoided the dinner menu and would stick to the tempura fried green beans, the prime rib coyotas, and the hummus. \\n\\nSo after eating our fill of the tempura friend green beans, we gave Hall Street Grill a bit of a rest for a couple of years. The other night we decided to revisit our old friend and try again. \\n\\nThe new menu has really blown us away. While the vegan and vegetarian options are still limited, there is enough on the menu otherwise to make up for it. Not to say a vegan dish or two would not be remiss here considering that this is still the Portland area after all.\\n\\nSo in order of things to try:\\nWild Boar Scrapple - I have had scrapple before, and it was nothing like this. This was possibly one of the most amazing dishes I have had in years, and will become a new standard for appetizers.\\n\\nCountry Ham Wrapped Peaches - Ham? Peaches? grilled? Awesome!\\n\\nPork Chop and Belly - Another amazing dish. And I HATE pork chops! \\n\\nAnd there are still several more items on the menu just begging to be tried!

Friends I met inside the club told me there would be plenty of food trucks just outside, but I wanted a sit down place to get out of the cool night,  if I could locate one open. It did not take me long to see Frank and the lights on.\\n\\nAwesome looking sign with a glow of bright yellow, outlined with red lettering of FRANK.  I peaked in and it looked like they may be closed even though the lights were on. I swung open the door and someone did approach me to find seating. I was in love with the historic building that had all the bells and whistles of exposed brick and concrete floors in keeping with a gritty downtown Austin vibe. The ceilings and lighting were more modern which was a slight disappointment. \\n\\nI really did not care what I was drinking, or eating and just told the waitress a recommendation was fine. She brought me a water and a bottle of beer from a local brewery that was tasty. The waitress was friendly the entire time and warned me they would be closing in around 30 minutes. I ordered a hot dog with cheese.\\n\\nMy food came out within 15 minutes. The bun was soft, the hot dog hot and the cheese gooey and delish. Three dipping sauces also accompanied the meal. I don't recall the names, but told they were house and I enjoyed. Washed down with a cold beer and I was loving life and happy with the selection. \\n\\nMy waitress checked on me once and at that time I decided to put in an order for one more item quickly before I was cut off. She recommended a Bratwurst and I said go for it although I have never had one and the thought of sauerkraut grossed me out. It now took less than 10 minutes as the small crowd had cleared and I was almost the last customer left. The kraut dog looked awesome and was full of goodies. The smell was definitely kraut. Although I was not crazy over it, just not my cup of tea I guess I ate every bit.\\n\\nI took a look around as I walked to the restroom. There is also a second floor, but I did not go upstairs. The facilities in the men's room was clean and no issues.\\n\\nCheckout easy and not to pricey.

We could not have been more disappointed. Please make sure to read this review of our experience before you head in.\\n\\nWe found a nice spot on their lovely patio and reviewed some appealing options on the French-inspired menu. We had some initial thoughts about what to order, but at the very moment our server arrived, a faint aroma of warming waffle drifted across our table and seduced us into making a last-second decision to order the \\"Sweet Vanilla Belgian Waffles.\\" This was a huge mistake. My usual benchmark for whether a place has pancakes or waffles worth trying is whether they bother with real maple syrup. This simple test has rarely failed me. I reason that if they understand the difference between real maple syrup and Aunt Jemima's corn-starch-diabetes-breakfast-syrup, they probably appreciate the merits of fresh waffles and pancakes made from scratch. Blue Dahlia passed this test, and the availability of real maple syrup helped support my hasty decision. But today I was fooled. The maple syrup on the menu at Blue Dahlia is 100% pure Vermont window-dressing.\\n\\nI could not immediately place it, but as soon as the waffles arrived, I noticed they looked somehow familiar. After a few bites, I was sure I had eaten this recipe before, and finally, after biting into a whole sugar crystal, I suddenly recognized the frozen waffle brand: Julian's. I asked my server if the waffles were Julian's. He declined to answer and brought the manager, who said they were a \\"French\\" brand, but could not remember the name. I politely insisted she check. She returned after a few minutes: \\"yes, Julian's.\\"\\n\\nSo I will concede that Julian's is my favorite brand of frozen waffle. Julian's makes a heck of a frozen waffle. Julian's is way better than Eggos, and if you haven't tried Julians and you like waffles, you might want to buy some Julian's next time you find yourself at the frozen food isle of an HEB. And yet, when I go out to a nice breakfast place, I am going specifically because I want a meal that can't be popped out of a plastic bag, tossed into the toaster for 2 minutes, and plopped onto a plate with fruit and syrup to disguise its unwholesome identity.\\n\\nWhen it came time to settle up, our server asked how everything was, which was a surprising question, given the revelation mere moments before that our meal came out of a box nearly as-is for a ~400% markup. After all, a box of Julian's with 4 frozen waffles is $4, so at $1 per waffle this plate of 2 frozen waffles really should've cost $2 retail instead of $8.50 before tax and tip. I kept the math to myself and just answered that I was surprised and disappointed at having been served frozen waffles. The manager took 50% off the waffles but offered no apology.\\n\\nI get it. They're not breaking any rules serving frozen waffles and it doesn't specifically say on the menu that they're made fresh. Heck, they even picked a great brand. But I think most of us expect fresh food when we choose to eat at a place that looks like Blue Dahlia instead of Denny's, so serving frozen waffles here feels pretty deceptive in this context. What bothers me most is that I probably would never have known the difference if I wasn't a big fan of waffles in general and Julian's in particular, which begs the question: what else at Blue Dahlia just comes out of a bag?"},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"As soon as you walk in very friendly staff.

The staff was friendly and helpful, recommending wines and providing insight on our dinner choices. I had one of the prix fixe options and while it was tasty, my seared scallops entr√©e contained only medium-large scallops with a tiny pile of saut√©ed vegetable garnish in the middle while the red meat entr√©es selected by my friends were piled high with food and a hearty starch side. While I was full by the end of the meal, I felt a little cheated since at least one of my friends had chosen the same prix fixe option so our meals were the same price. However, the scallops were very good and I have no real complaints about the meal as a whole aside from my \\"perceived value\\" of it compared to the options my friends chose.\\n\\nThe view was fantastic, of course, and the ambiance was perfect for us to relax, chat over the meal, and enjoy the view.

There are lots of burgers and American fare to choose from, but I thought this place was Italian cuisine. Mom ordered lasagna and I ordered a combo, which included eggplant parmigiana, veal parmigiana and pasta. Everything arrived slightly warm, almost cold. The pasta was so over cooked that it was \\"bloated\\" looking. The sauce tasted like it had a lot of sugar added. The eggplant was okay, and the veal was dry, tough and both were very small portioned for the price. The same goes for the lasagna.

The food, though very, very good, did not blow me away.  The flavours are asian inspired, lots of curry, ginger, scallions, etc.  Other than probably Chinois in Santa Monica, I find it very difficult to be blown away by Asian inspired dishes.

Huge chunks of paneer (cheese cubes) sat in the concoction. Al-Amin's version is much lighter than Indian restaurants -- I wonder if this is typical of Bangladeshi palak paneer? I loved the cheese, it actually had flavor on its own. Great dish. FYI, the dish does not come with rice, I assume that is something extra you must order. But if you order a biryani, there is no need to order rice because it comes with PLENTY. Yes, the plate of chicken biryani we received was probably enough for two huge meals or three small meals.

The first time was on a Saturday night in the fall of 2010 and it was a fantastic experience.  There were three of us, we were seated in the back (thus out of the way), and our waiter was phenomenal.  He was from Italy (as are most of the staff) and I honestly felt as though I was in Italy for the evening.  The service was excellent, relaxed, unhurried.  He was attentive and delightful, making some wonderful food suggestions.  At the end of the evening, we had to actually ask for the bill.  The host told us that they do not bring the bill until you ask for it, as is done in Italy.  What a refreshing change from the rush-rush feeling you often get in restaurants!  On the way out, we were complimenting the host and our waiter rushed over, asking if everything was okay -- he must have thought we were complaining!\\n\\nWent again a few months later with the same companions; said waiter was no longer there, we were seated next to the door (ugh!) on a freezing cold Saturday night of a long weekend.  It was horrible.  There's no place to wait, so people stood there, staring at us.  We were jammed in cheek to jowl.  Service was rushed, food was so-so, plates weren't cleared, and oh yes, they presented us with the bill this time with no prompting.  It might have been an off-night, so I probably would try them again, but I won't rush.  It's not cheap and there isn't a full bar, FYI.

The interior atmosphere was super relaxed, with lots of big tables and a nice looking bar. there were also board games on a shelf, and they even had dominion.\\n\\nThe menu was not too expensive, with about 3 different bagel sandwiches as well as some scrambles and a few sweet items on the menu. I went with the Wesley bagel sandwich which had bacon, kale, cream cheese, and sriracha. I got this on the cheddar Serrano bagel which gave it a little extra kick. Most of the rest of my group got the Eisenhower bagel which was also delicious and had prosciutto,  egg, cream cheese, and a few other things on it. The Eisenhower bagel was very good, but I thought the Wesley was even better. It was definitely the best bagel sandwich I've had in Portland and probably one of the best I've ever had . The bagels are very light and airy on the inside but crispy on the outside, unlike Bowery bagels which are a bit doughy but still good. They also have 5 day-old bagels for 4 bucks , which one of my friends sad were really good.\\n\\nThe coffee they serve there is also worth mentioning, although I'm not sure what brand it was it was very good.

Since my friend loves JINYA, I wanted to give the place another try, especially since I had only been when they had just opened.  Unfortunately, I still don't love JINYA's ramen.\\n\\nParking gets crazy in the evenings, so just be aware that you may need to give yourself extra time to find a spot if you're meeting someone there.  Or, you'll have to valet your car, which I think is ridiculous... But I digress.\\n\\nThe restaurant is pretty small, so be prepared for a wait - even on a weeknight.  I think I arrived a little before 6:30 pm on a Tuesday and was quoted a 15 to 20-minute wait, but my friend and I actually waited more than 30 minutes for a table for 2 to open up.\\n\\nSince I typically order the tonkotsu at ramen joints, I ordered JINYA's Tonkotsu Black ramen both times.  I was hoping my second bowl would be better than it was during the first visit.\\n\\n| JINYA Tonkotsu Black |\\n\\nTheir signature version of tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen includes pork chashu, kikurage (wood ear mushroom), green onions, nori (dried seaweed), seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, spicy sauce, and thin noodles.  When you first receive your bowl, you look into it and think the portion looks small.  However, I think it's just an illusion since one bowl is plenty for me - and I can eat a lot.  If you want more noodles, however, you'll have to take tiny sips of your broth to save some because you don't get a lot in a bowl.  \\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the various toppings in the ramen, the consistency of JINYA's tonkotsu broth is thicker than I'm accustomed to having with ramen.  I thought the \\"thickness\\" of the broth was due to it sitting in the pot for too long as when I had it the first week of their opening, but at my second visit, I realized that it's made/meant to be thick.  Not only was the broth too thick for my taste, it just wasn't as tasty as the tonkotsu broth that I enjoy at my favorite ramen joints.  But that's just my opinion, and obviously there are many who love it.\\n\\nOverall, JINYA Ramen Bar gets 3 stars since I think their ramen is \\"A-OK.\\"  Service here has been fine both times, but I personally don't think their ramen is worth the trouble of looking for a parking spot for more than 10 minutes or waiting over 30 minutes for a table on a weeknight.  I probably won't go out of my way to give JINYA a third try."},{"name":"Antolino's Pizza","address":"3183 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Pizza arrived good and Hott.

Yeah, its not winchells where you can get donuts for $1-2, but we got a Capt Crunch, a Pothole, and a \\"large\\" coffee for under $6 so I was actually surprised at how affordable it was.  We hit it up around 8AM on a Friday and there were only 4 or 5 people in front of us.  The donuts are in two separate display cases and the menu above doesnt list what is in all of them (or else I didnt notice as the place is trippy) so I wish they had menus.  I can see being really stressed if there are 45 people behind you and after 30 minutes in line you just wanna make sure and order something good and have a few questions.  The capt crunch was tasty...simple but tasty.  I got the pothole so I could try their famous bavarian cream, which was pretty good once I got to it but cream occupied MAYBE 20% of the inside which was severely disappointing.  Speaking of head scratchers, being a DONUT place...in raining PORTLAND no less...can I please get a LARGE cup of coffee?  It wasnt that good either and the coffee station was out of most everything.  Act like you been there before and station one person in line while the other gets coffee across the alley, on the other side of the patioo seating. :) One size which was a standard small-medium cup and as the line built up I wasnt waiting in line for a refill. Anyways, donuts were tasty but nothing earth shattering.  They do use yeast so you get a thick, more hearty donut which personally I enjoyed. A few notes...parking is street.  Avoid the lot across the street if possible.  My total was $2.50 and dude didnt have ANY coin change.  I had 40 cents, so $2.40 and he wouldnt take it. He refused to give me my keys until I went somewhere to get coins...or overpaid.  Shrugged at me like \\"hey, what are you going to do clown, I got your keys.\\" UNREAL.

I have to say, while the original spot has a lot more in a compact space, Voodoo Too was a lot easier and less crowded. If you're in the east side, you're better off going to Voodoo too. But then again, you'd be missing out on the original home. \\n\\nThe doughnuts.. My voodoo doll wasn't nearly as detailed here as it was at Voodoo too. The lack of the face.. I dunno, something about that just didn't excite me as much. I guess I'm just one morbid mofo who likes to bite the heads off his gummy bears but the fact that voodoo too has more time to draw in the face as well as include a little horror filled face onto their voodoo doll doughnuts wins points for me. \\n\\nBut when it comes to the classic bacon maple doughnut, you're not going to go wrong here. Holy hell, that was a delicious little doughnut. Something about Bacon on a doughnut may make you feel terribly wrong, but don't worry, it's so terribly right in every possible way. \\n\\nThe line could be an issue as well. Like I said, the too location had no wait and this one had about a 10 person wait ahead of me. Add to that the folks didn't know what the hell they wanted.

Let me tell you, such horrible waste of the efforts of all the people who work hard to make that bowl of food enjoyable. Cold pork stock looses the silky decadent flavor and just tastes heavy, salty and dirty.\\nThank you, Pablo for a memorable experience.

This place is iconic to Portland and if I had a dollar every time I heard someone say that they should go to Voodoo when they're here I'd have enough to buy several dozen far superior doughnuts. This place is overrated, period. I have several gripes, concerning both locations, starting with the most obvious one- GET ANOTHER CASHIER. Seriously, waiting in line for 30-60 minutes for mediocre doughnuts is just not the business. If you're at the downtown location anytime at night, expect a throng of drunk people trying like hell to figure what they're going to order, which only slows down the process. Sure, while you wait you can stare at the totally, like, kitschy gaudy decoration and marvel how quirky this doughnut shop is but then after the first 20 minutes of waiting you realize you could be doing much better things with your life like making a sandwich, watching E! News Network or I dunno, getting a doughnut somewhere else. Just some ideas. The doughnuts themselves? Not even that good. They've never tasted fresh and they are definitely NOT worth the wait. If you want to do a typical thing while visiting or living in Portland, sure go here. Knock yourself out. You're basically paying for the Voodoo brand and there's a whole bevy of great pastry and doughnut shops here."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite ramen places in Atlanta.

I used to think that it was expensive here, but in all actuality, it is not; $11 for steak and eggs is totally reasonable.  The husband and I used to order the re-builder, which is 3 eggs, steak, potatoes and toast.  There have been occasions where the husband, being the super picky chef guy, has returned the steak for being over cooked.  They have always comped the meal when that has occurred and sent us back a fresh, correctly cooked meal.  We went back this morning after not having been for at least  a year.  I had the NoPo scramble, which is pepper bacon, sausage, cheese all mixed up in scrambled eggs.  I added avocado for a nice touch.  The husband had one of the breakfast sammies, his choice being the Tara's Craving: proscuitto, bacon, eggs and cheese on ciabatta bread.  Very good!!  The husband also had a cappucino, and the bill came to $21.  Not bad!  We had prompt, courteous and attentive service, and the food is fresh, well prepared, and all at a decent price.    We originally planned to go there this morning, but I decided we should try Miss Delta's.  Not open til 5.  Then, we thought we might try Gravy (never been), but the tables were all full and there were at least 4 folks waiting.  I don't like to wait anywhere, so we headed right back to Equinox.

I would like to say that the correct sandwich and drinks were delicious, but the sandwich was overly crunchy with next to no fillings and tasted strongly of overly sweet mayonnaise. They were out of boba and the avocado for one of the drinks was underripe and it did not taste good. They were also playing loud music with very heavy base and they didn't seem to have any air conditioning, which gave us a headache.

Come on, those hot, crispy, salty, fun shaped pieces of heaven called Waffle Fries...?Forget about it! So Good! \\n\\nAs an avid CFA lover, what a treat it was to finally visit the original Chick-fil-A! This location is right around the corner from my house and I've patronized the drive-thru but never got to go inside until this week. \\n\\nEstablished in 1946, this Chick-Fil-A is cool because it is the ORIGINAL Chick-Fil-A therefore it serves as kind of a mini museum. Besides the life sized statue of Truett Cathy sitting on a bench outside the restaurant, there are photos and plaques on the inside that tell you all about how CFA got its start and how the restaurant actually got its name. You also see pictures of the original building and can compare it to how it looks now. The little red Dwarf door is just the cutest thing ever, am I right?! My wife and I had to crawl through it because...I mean, who could resist? Honorable mention for sheer adorableness: The moving snow white and the seven dwarfs frame picture on the back wall of the restaurant...neat!\\n\\nThe restaurant was impeccably clean with comfy booths and ample seating but my favorite part of the whole experience was the service! It felt like we were in an ole-timey diner where the wait staff was so super courteous, sweet and attentive and everything out of their mouths was, \\"it's my pleasure ma'am.\\" I LOVED IT! I saw on Andrea A's review that the servers' length of service is listed on their badges and some of them have been there for 15+ years! Wow I wish I'd known, that's pretty cool. Next time I'll be sure to look out for that. \\n\\nYou will also find menu items here that you won't find at just any CFA--such as fried okra and carrot-raisin salad. And for dessert apple turnovers and chocolate icebox pie! I tried the carrot raisin salad and it was okayyy but I probably wouldn't order it again--the carrots were pretty mushy. \\n\\n Overall, this is a very fun location to eat at and every ATLien should visit at least once because it's one of those rare Atlanta gems that just makes you feel like you've had a special experience.\\n\\n Since we ate here for lunch, I'd love to come back to try breakfast."},{"name":"New India Buffet","address":"901 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Authentic Delicious Indian Style food. \\n\\nMy favourites here are the Butter Chicken, the Lamb Curry, Naan Bread and the Gulab Jamun. \\n\\nWhile dining you get a great view of the Downtown core and of our beautiful North Shore Mountains. \\n\\nSomething funny and not so funny at the same time ... the bench seats that are seemingly bolted to the floor ... are NOT!

I can only imagine how busy they were that evening, so I appreciated how attentive and friendly the entire staff was. \\n\\nSadly, the food just wasn't up to par for the prices.

Even those not inclined to eat vegetarian dishes would be content with the myriad of meat-imitation dishes at Garden Cafe. \\n\\nThe servers are always friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. Don't let the somewhat sketchy location of this place turn you off. The chefs know how to work magic with their dishes, and it is certainly a favorite of mine. The only complaint I have is that they do not serve alcohol. If you're looking to have a drink with your dinner, I suggest you just drink before and after, because the food will surely make up for the lack of alcohol!"},{"name":"Inka Chicken","address":"1707 Wells Branch Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great roast chicken. I've been anxious to try this place on Wells Branch near 35 ever since I noticed the signs, but rush hour traffic makes it impossible to turn if you're travelling westbound, and Wells Branch is a must-avoid east-bound.\\n\\nSo when I finally got to Inka, I was hit by the Peruvian aromatics of the roast chicken. I had a half chicken, 2 sides combo for $12.  Someone else has post on Yelp the economic comparison of this place, but for juicy, nicely roasted chicken, I'd rather eat at Inka than score the dry, mummified $5.99 chickens you get at HEB.  FYI - a whole chicken at Inka is $10.99.\\n\\nInka Chicken is set-up like fast food (with a drive-thru window as well) but tastes like gourmet.  I was reminded of El Pollo Loco in California and Swiss Chalet in Canada -  awesome roast chicken places. I ordered the basmati rice and vegetables and enjoyed the sampler of yucca and plantains.  The chicken, though, was the best part with sharp citrusy spices.  My pieces were a little too blackened (didn't look a thing like the photos!) but it was flavorful and moist.  You get side sauces - hot and mild - that are both pretty good.\\n\\nThe staff is very friendly and eager to answer questions about the unique menu.\\n\\nGuessing by the traffic, Inka is off to a good start.  A must have, if you love roast chicken and want a taste alternative from fried or BBQ chickens.  I hope Inka fares better than Micca Pichu the Peruvian restaurant that opened and closed just on the other side of 35."},{"name":"Highland Bakery Midtown","address":"1180 Peachtree St NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Wonderful vegetarian options, nice staff, and reasonably priced."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wow this place is so cool !

I had a Carnitas Burrito which the waitress told me had lots of carnitas in it, and she was sure telling the truth! It was loaded and very tasty!\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were good, although we like hotter salsa and may ask next time to see if they have a spicier offering.\\n\\nThe margaritas were good and you could taste that they contained alcohol, which is nice, but seemed somewhat small.

I say \\"tried\\" because my friend called for a reservation for two people and was told they don't do reservations for two, but it's first come, first served for outdoor seating. That was important to us, because the interior of the restaurant is always so loud, it is almost impossible to have a conversation. There were plenty of tables available outside when we showed up at 6:15 but the man at the door (not the owner) told us he would only seat us inside because we were two. We explained what we had been told on the phone and that the inside is always so loud you can't converse, but he just repeated \\"inside\\" and asked one of his waiters who was standing there how many tables he had available outside. Confused, I asked if he was checking for us, and he angrily said, \\"No, I told you only inside.\\" I said, \\"well, thanks for trying\\" and he sarcastically replied \\"you're welcome\\" and asked the people behind us how many in their party. We ended up at Hannibal's next door having an amazing evening, but just thought people should be warned if they dare show up with only two people! I don't know if it was because we were two women and they assumed they wouldn't make much off us (btw the wine we purchased at Hannibal's alone was $150) but I wonder if a man and woman wishing to sit outside for a romantic Saturday night date would have been treated the same way.

The old woman came back and looked at my friend's tip (it was only a small portion of the total).  She then said, \\"You need to tip 15%.  This is only 10%!\\". The old lady never even bothered to look at I and my other friend's part of tip.  My other friend pointed this out and the dragon lady yelled, \\"What we do wrong? You need to tip more!\\".

I loved it, it was like a different take on a s'more.\\n\\nI have tried just about every doughnut on the menu and can narrow it down to a top three: The Memphis Mafia, Miami Vice and McMinnville Cream.\\n\\nVooDoo wins for fun and comfort.\\n\\nI am not a fan of the super sweet frosting and topping overload but it keeps me from overeating!  These doughnuts are soft, moist and made fresh.  A plus in my book! They also provide a vegan selection.\\n\\nA must when traveling with young adults and the young at heart!\\n\\nTIPS:\\n- Open 24 Hours\\n- Street Parking\\n- Cash Only (ATM inside)\\n- Long Lines\\n- Selection is limited in the evenings.\\n- Bring a Camera"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Tourist trap...BEWARE!!!!

We waited quite some time for our waiter to greet our table.  Once he did, we ordered 2 appetizers which came out in the blink of an eye.  So fast that we actually asked him to wait a few minutes to place our entree orders, we didn't want to rush.  That seemed to bother him...nevertheless, he did it.  For apps we had shrimp cocktail and oysters, and I got a clam chowder. The shellfish was the best and only good part of the meal.  The clam chowder was lukewarm, tasteless and completely lacked flavor. We saw other tables with bread so asked our waiter for it, twice might I add, before getting it.\\n2 of us got salmon, which the waiter said the chef recommended medium rare.  1 of us ordered it that way, the other wanted it well done.  The other 2 diners got filet, both ordered medium rare.  We shared mushrooms and asparagus for the table.  Both sides were good, but all entrees were just OK at best.  Both steaks were overcooked, more like medium-well instead of medium rare; and both salmons were VERY well done. Portion sizes on the salmon were ridiculously small, with mine being so small and flat that I wondered if they plated it accidentally and it was something else. The waiter didn't check on us, or I would have told him.  I meant to call, actually, to speak with a Manager because it was that bad, but never got around to it.  I would easily go to L'Andana or Capital Grille over this place any day.  The portion sizes were small, it was more expensive than necessary and the service was absolutely not worth the price.

The building is hard to miss as \\"KILLER BURGERS\\" is plastered along all the front.\\n\\nThis is my first visit to Grindhouse after passing it many times, usually to visit Fat Matt's Rib Shack. I finally decided to swing by on the way home from an afternoon event in L5P. I was by myself on a rainy, cold weekday evening and the restaurant was about 30% full. As you enter you'll see a fairly large enclosed patio - empty this evening probably due to the cold. You walk up to the counter to order - there are menus but the convenient boards provide your options.\\n\\nThe bar in this restaurant is really fantastic - great robot mural by Eric Joyner and similar motifs abound. I loved the vibe of this place and could see it as a regular hangout if I lived closer. The place also has an exceptional craft beer menu and happened to have cans of my favorite local, Creature Comforts Tropicalia so how could I resist?\\n\\nFor my meal I ordered a fairly basic double cheese burger with sweet potato fries - holy $#!T this is an amazing burger!  Some of my friends argue about burgers and there seems to be two schools of thought - there's the classic thick-meat style which I'm a huge fan of - Farmburger comes to mind. Then there's the double-thin-meat style popularized by Holeman and Finch and others. To tell the truth, while the H&F burger is awesome, the burger at Grindhouse to me is as good if not better. This is a perfect combination of oozy-cheese, delicious bread, succulent meat and delicious toppings. Wow.\\n\\nI also liked the sweet-potato fries quite a bit - these are wavy cut, on the thick side with crisp outsides, more like steak fries than potato sticks. Delicious.\\n\\nTonight one of my favorite movies, David Lynch's Dune is projected on the wall - you can't get much better than this.\\n\\nThe service was good with a helpful person at the counter and a fairly quick delivery.

This landmark restaurant in the city of Atlanta provides hearty, comfort southern cuisine. The food is fantastic and the service has always been professional and kind. This is a family style restaurant that is great for groups of all sizes. My faves are the baked chicken breast over cornbread dressing with gravy, grilled catfish and fried chicken! Another random fav is the complimentary bread basket composed of yeast rolls, cornbread and cinnamon rolls. The menu offers a plethora of delicious dishes. Which is a great excuse to return again and again. The ambiance is old school and somewhat appears formal based upon the white linen tablecloths. But don't be fooled, attire is casual. The walls are draped with countless frames offering a visual history of the many that have dined. It really does feel like home. My minuses are the parking and the wait. Be forewarned patience and understanding are needed for both. The restaurant attracts hoards of people so be mindful of visiting during peak times, specifically weekends which can be down right madness unless you come within the first few hours of opening. Although the restaurant offers a private parking lot, spaces are still limited and fill up fast. Be prepared for street parking and be mindful exactly where you do so (tickets, paid park, etc.). I definitely recommend Mary Mac's Tea Room to be added to everyone's \\"To-Dine List\\"."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Two Urban Licks was a great experience.

We each tried a three course combo off of the week's price fixe menu. Although I'm unsure that these items hit the regular menu, they're worth mentioning:\\n\\nHighlights that we fought over included a lamb-apricot stew served in half butternut squash, caramel pudding with candied pecans, and a black eyed pea cake as an appetizer. I can't say enough about each of the dishes - so I'll just say this: try them if you have the opportunity.\\n\\nLowlights included a creole beef dish with grits. Though the precise name of the dish has escaped me, I was disappointed with the flavor as it got lost in the texture of the ultra-creamy (basically soupy) grits. I grew up on this Southern staple, so it's possible I'm just spoiled, but the texture threw me for a loop, not to mention the fact that really complex (and delicious might I add) flavor of the beef was just drowned out by the pool of grits it swam in. What we could rescue, we loved, and while I wasn't enthralled with the cheesy grits, they did temporarily satisfy my taste for them until our next trip back to grit-motherland.\\n\\nI appreciated the fact that the food was really well thought out:  presentation, ingredient quality, and originality were all pretty fantastic. After becoming accustomed to a new restaurant every 50 ft while living in Manhattan, I naively had low expectations for the Columbus restaurant scene. How wrong I was!  Though there's lots of good eats around, I've still found that this tri-fecta is pretty hard to come by.\\n\\nThe restaurant was surprisingly empty, although it was a weeknight. The service was prompt if not overbearing - however, I'm sure that this is also attributable to the relatively empty dining room. Our waiter, though I think he was attempting to be friendly, largely came off as condescending. If the lamb apricot stew were less tasty, I might have minded his bad humor more, however, he stands between Black Creek Bistro and my fifth star."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So, my wife and I stopped by a couple weeks ago for dinner.

We used to get these by the bag in the old days down in Duxbury and stand around the sink cracking them open and drinking Champagne.  Then they won that best of 50 oysters blind tasting, Per Se starting serving them for their signature dish, and the rest is history...\\n\\nNow that they've opened a 2nd location in the 'burbs (across from Tuscan Kitchen, behind Burlington Mall), one would hope it might become slightly easier to get in.  But no, you definitely need a reservation, which for us was only available at 9PM on a Friday night.\\n\\nThe interior is reminiscent of the Kenmore Square location, but seems a bit more spacious and less crowded, although it was definitely packed with eager oyster slurpers (strangely, a back room wasn't being used).  The seating was VERY comfortable, and although we didn't sit at the long bar or the kitchen counter, they look very cushy too.  Importantly, the restaurant is a lot quieter than the notoriously loud original, which I greatly appreciated.\\n\\nAs expected, great oysters.  We tried 3 different East Coasts and one West Coast, and as usual preferred the Island Creeks (from a total selection of 9 different oysters).  They also serve a \\"Row 34\\" from Island Creek, which was described as \\"more elegant\\", but I can't say I could immediately tell the difference.  You won't go wrong with the selection and serving of oysters here.\\n\\nI've always ICOB is more about the oysters than the other fish dishes (although they also serve steak and a burger!).  Not that the other dishes are not generally good or even excellent, but you just can't beat the perfection of a fresher than fresh oyster and a nice glass of wine.  And I still feel that way.\\n\\nThe famous CRISPY OYSTER SLIDERS (on a brioche roll, with lime chile a√Øoli), each for $4.00, was much better than the failed version I last had at Kenmore Sq (seem my Yelp review).  But I'm still not really enamored with this dish.  A bit to oily and rich, and not sufficiently counterbalance by the acid (YMMV).\\n\\nThe Rhode Island-style WARM BUTTERED LOBSTER ROLL (served on a rosemary roll, with cole slaw, kettle chips) for $26 was delicious.  However, I thought the hefty brioche bun was a bit too much for the amount of lobster and tended to dominate each bite.  50% more lobster or 50% less roll would have helped.  The liberal bowl of slaw was excellent.  As good chips as I've had.\\n\\nCocktails were delicious, and a nice glass of white burgundy went well with the lobster.\\n\\nAll in all, it's exciting to have a second location a bit closer to home.  One can hope that when the excitement cools, it might be a bit easier to get into at the last minute, but since it's definitely one of the best restaurants in the Burlington area, that may just be a daydream."},{"name":"Pannullo's Italian Restaurant","address":"216 S Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh!

This is the latest outpost of a Japanese ramen shop chain.  It is a convenient 5 min. walk from the Harvard Square T stop.  \\n\\nI ordered the Tokusen Toroniku with pork cheek meat, shio flavored.  The broth, which is pork based, has excellent flavor and aroma.  It has a rich pork flavor that comes through clearly and is not overwhelmed by miso or soy sauce.  I will try the other flavors at a later date.  The ramen itself is fairly standard,  with a good texture and taste.  Not as outstanding as yume wo katare, which has unique noodles, but very good. Pork cheek slices are very good, though not as exceptional as yume wo katare, nor as good as the charred pork at totto ramen.  Generous number of slices and still tasty.  I ordered my ramen with a soft-boiled egg, which could have been cooked a little less, but nonetheless, had good flavor.  I also added nori and extra noodles.  They give you a generous helping of scallions which was tasty, and mushrooms and bamboo shoots.  Would have liked more mushrooms.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very civilized.  Clean, airy, neat, they also accept credit cards.  It is a modern restaurant unlike Sapporo ramen (which is a hole in the wall) or yume (which is cramped and feels like a classroom).  staff is very professional and helpful.  So if you're looking for a very good execution of the local branch of a chain of ramen shops, here it is.

The crust around the edge was nicely cooked and tasted yeasty, like bread... not flat, like cardboard.

I drove back to my job and discovered that there was NO tarter sauce in either bag just cocktail sauce. So I called her and told her the matter and she stated that she forgot I was getting shrimp and they only put cocktail sauce in with shrimp and since I didn't get fish that they didn't put it in... Wait, what? But I asked for it, for one, and both condiments go with SEAFOOD. The clerk then told me to bring some of the cocktail sauce back to the store and she would be happy to exchange it. smh. Did she just tell me to bring condiments back for an exchange??? Yes she did. and I would have to pay extra for tarter sauce. I was livid to say the least.

My first visit my boyfriend had the Shrimp Etoufee which I was shocked he choose but my taste buds and tummy thanked him later it was surprisingly good and only needed a drop of Tabasco ( me like it hot and spicy). I had the Fried Chili Seafood Fry it was a platter of calamari, scallops and shrimp deep fried with an Asian Chili sauce doused through it was just as delicious. My boyfriend of course attacked my plate and partook of the seafood menagerie before me. Meanwhile, the couple next to us ordered a two pound seafood boil that looked awesome and upset us that we didn't see it first. I bet you have already guessed what we had on the second visit following....that's right The 4lb. Seafood Boil which had steamed red potatoes, corn, crab legs, shrimp, clams and mussels.

I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time, but it just never seemed to be the right time to give it a shot; I'm glad that is no longer the case. \\n\\nMy fianc√© and I arrived at the small (cozy?) restaurant and were quickly greeted by the owner who just so happened to be manning the register. Their menu is a large poster on the wall which was great because each item was accompanied by its photo which was helpful. \\n\\nWe settled on 3 Pork Tamales, 2 Quesatacos, 2 Gorditas and Chips & Salsa as an appetizer. I don't think the chips were made in-house but that salsa definitely was; it had such a deep and fresh taste to it, I loved it. The quesatacos, while somewhat small in my opinion, had a very nice taste. The meat had a nice grilled taste and the tortillas added a slightly sweet touch which worked perfectly with the sauces that were left on the table. Up to this point, my meal was very good but the gorditas (as well as the extremely friendly and social owner) were pretty much what ensured my return. \\n\\nSadly, it was my first taste of authentic gorditas but it was worth the wait because they were great. The slightly doughy texture along with the crispy exterior just created the perfect pocket for the awesome fillings. The seasoned beef, crisp lettuce and cream sauce were exactly what I wanted. The chicken version didn't taste as great, I believe the chicken was a bit bland, but I'll ensure I order many more gorditas on my next visit. \\n\\nGreat sauces, great food and truly great service that gave it a family vibe are all part of why we'll definitely be returning here."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Longest line and not really worth the hype.

I also ordered onion rings because the first time I got the onion rings they were very crispy but this time they were partially cooked and not crispy at all. I am very disappointed in the Old Bag of Nails Pub because I know they can do better.  When I called in to order appetizers, I was told that they were half price during happy hour. When I got to the restaurant to pick up my order , they only took $2 off. I had a car full of people that can vouch that the employee who answered the phone told me that the appetizers were half price until 7 p.m. I am very unhappy.

Food usually comes out fairly quickly. \\n\\nTheir burgers are made from smaller patties and lighter buns, so I don't feel like I ate a brick once I've finished my meal. I can't bring myself to order any of their specialty burgers because I can be picky like a 5-year-old. Instead, I normally order a junior burger with pimento cheese. The burgers taste fresh and juicy, and are hard to put down. As a side note-  a few years ago I \\"gave up\\" burgers after learning how much saturated fat is in one. I really wanted to get away from those humongous, near flavorless save for the toppings burgers that sports bars serve. Now I only eat a few burgers a year now, and most of those are from Grindhouse. \\n\\nThe majorly tempting item on the menu here are their boozy milkshakes. I'm a HUGE Whynatte fan, so I love their Stimulus Package - whynatte, creme de menthe, and oreos. I wish they had various sizes because I'd definitely be good with half of their normal size ( and my diet would thank me, too). \\n\\nI've never been a huge fan of any of their sides, particularly because you have to pay more money on top of the burger price for some fries. I've never thought their fries were that great so I usually opt for onion rings - which are also good, but not excellent. \\n\\nI sat next to someone once at the bar who ordered a salad. The salad looked fantastic and I was so tempted to get it but... really, salad at a burger place?!? I just couldn't bear to do it. Maybe if friends had dragged me here and I really didn't want a burger.  \\n\\nI really like the vibe of Grindhouse - but it's usually quite busy and louder than I prefer. The staff is a weird mix. Most of them seem to have a friendly disposition but appear to be so busy that if you try to interrupt them or ask for something, they appear annoyed, or worse, I've seen employees ignore customers trying to get their attention for several minutes. I wonder if they are under-staffed, and overall customer service might be a little better if they had one or two more employees working per shift. \\n\\nIt should also be noted that this isn't the most family friendly environment all of the time- for example on Monday nights when they host adult trivia. WARNING - do not read the rest of this paragraph if you are sensitive to non-PC adult conversations. This past Monday during our visit, the tiebreaker question was \\"What three things could you purchase from a Walmart that would freak out the cash register employee the most?\\" which was followed up by answers like a pregnancy test, a coat hanger, and a tarp (!!!!!!!) - with all of this being piped in throughout the entire restaurant The folks playing appeared to be having a good time but fair warning about Monday nights. \\n\\nThe sound system is pretty loud- which as a dedicated trivia player in my past life, I can appreciate - but it made it next to impossible for us to enjoy our meal in peace. I think we just maybe hit it at the wrong time. \\n\\nI'll keep coming back because I love the burgers and milkshakes- but there are plenty of other choices for friendlier staff, non-stressful seating, and easy conversation."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hip little hang out in the Virginia Highlands area of Atlanta.

They are popping up all over the place (La Buca, Grub, Crave, Jules, Bin 941), and they are doing very well. Speaking of Bin 941/942, La Brasserie has chefs and staff from these two popular tapas bars. Clearly, they have brought their passion and creativity with them to La Brasserie.\\n\\nLa Brasserie has a small, well-rounded menu based on southern German and classic French dishes, and an emphasis is placed upon weekly specials: Wednesday, for example, is Bouillabaisse, Thursday is pork schnitzel and Sunday the house takes a diversion to England (whathehuh?) for a traditional roast. \\n\\nWhen I ate there last week, the place (all ten tables) was packed, so me and my peeps sat at the bar. Not only did we not mind sitting at the bar, but we would recommend it...especially if you are by yourself or a party of two. We nursed pints of draft Kronenberg 1664 while we watched the three chefs create almost every dish on the menu. I selected the schnitzel - based on what I saw coming out of that teeny, tiny kitchen - and it was amazing.\\n\\nI would like to take this opportunity to comment upon the famed La Brasserie onion tart. Many reviewers from sites such as Martini Boys and Dine Here have been raving about the onion tart starter. I ordered this as an appy, and I was impressed, but it is not life altering. The $10 duck confit starter, which a member of my group ordered, seemed to be a better value and quality.\\n\\nI do love this restaurant though.

In doing research we actually never stumbled upon it but a local told us about it and we had to check it out.\\n\\nThe concept is they took an old school and converted it into several bars and a hotel. Different rooms have different bars which are different types and themes. For example, the honors room is an elevated cocktail bar. Detention, is a whiskey bar. They have a rum bar which plays Jamaican themed music. The list goes on and on including an old theater that plays old movies. The school has stayed true to the old pictures hanging on the wall, bathrooms, and all the details which makes this place super unique and fun to just walk through and explore. \\n\\nThe property itself is beautiful and there's places to sit outside or inside these bars. The hotel has a sitting pool and while I didn't stay there I can imagine the rooms are as unique as the school itself. We found an old bar called the boiler room where we got cocktails and had a shuffleboard table and darts that we played.

We made reservations for a Friday night and parked in a parallel spot on the street (we got lucky!). We were sat pretty quickly, but experiences super slow service throughout the meal. Though the service was not fantastic, the food certainly was. \\n\\nFor appetizers we ordered: the pimento cheese hush puppies and the beef tartar. The hush puppies were AMAZING!!!! They come perfectly fried (crispy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside) paired with the most delicious pimento cheese spread and a red pepper jelly. This app usually comes with ham, but we opted for it without. The hush puppies actually came out second, but we wished we ordered 2 of these instead of 2 different appetizers. That's not to say the beef tartare wasn't delicious--it was! The perfect balance of flavoring on little crustinis. Definitely recommend both! \\n\\nFor dinner, we shared The Duke (burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions) and the Springer Mountain Chicken. The Duke was delicious, but there was a bit too much blue cheese on it. The blue cheese was overwhelming, and it felt like there was more of it than actual meat. Once we scraped some off, the blue cheese became the perfect complement. It comes with a heap of fries (ya know, in case you really want to add to the heart attack ;)). The Springer Mountain chicken was my least favorite of the two. Though it was fresh and the chicken was perfectly cooked, there was wayyyyy too much white wine. It felt like my chicken was drunk. Which was particularly odd since there was no mention of white wine in the description of the dish. \\n\\nFor dessert: GET THE BREAD PUDDING. Holy crap, it was the highlight of the dinner! Remember when I talked about the hush puppies? Well, this was even better! It's swimming in this caramel sauce that I just want to drink, it's so good. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend giving King + Duke a try. It would be good to note that majority of people sitting outside were just there for drinks and apps rather than actual meals, but don't let that deter you from trying their delicious, unique menu.

I liked it and was excited for our meal.  Water is served in mason jars, obvi.  And the drink menu is EXTENSIVE.  I want to return to Frank's in order to try an adult beverage.  For this lunch time meal, i just stuck with water.  I ordered the min-corn dogs and we split a basket of plain waffle fries.  The dipping sauces were sriacha aioli and bacon ranch.  The sauces were NICE.  Pretty great actually.  The food arrived quickly.  The little smokie corn dogs were good-they were accurate in their description:)  The batter was crisp and warm, and the lil smokies were served on a stick-always fun.  The fries-waffle fries to be exact-were just okay.  I LOVE waffle fries.  But these were a little overly crisp...and seemed to be just frozen fries? The sauce into which I dipped the fries was so nice-the aioli especially was just a flavor dream.  But the fries were okay at best.

The sheer number of choices of cuisine is great when you're thinking about what you want to eat, and if you go with a group everyone can find something they'll like. Unfortunately, none of it is particularly good, and Buddachen is up against some fierce competition in the Coolidge to Kenmore area for Chinese, Korean, and especially Thai and Japanese cuisine. That being said, both of us enjoyed our food. The sushi was tasty and fresh and the hot plate chicken was hot and delicious.

I do know that parking and getting around Downtown Atlanta can be a hassle, but they will validate parking if you park in the back of the building on Peachtree Pl.  I decided to come by for lunch to get a feel for what it is like to dine at one of Atlanta's most talked about restaurants.  I simply walked in and was greeted by one of the servers.  I decided to sit at the tables instead of the bar.  The inside was elegant and the seats were comfortable.  I ordered the Buffalo Fried Oysters along with the 925 sweet yams.  As with many high end restaurants, you cannot expect large portions.  The yams were delicious and the fried oysters covered in buffalo sauce with lettuce and bleu cheese were a treat to die for.  Despite the bad reviews I was surprised.  The server Jaz did his job and provided excellent service.  I know Scales 925 has the potential to be greater than what most people say about it.

They have an excellent pickle plate that usually contains a wide variety of pickles. The brisket can be excellent and is worth the flip of a coin.  I also like the duck salad when the duck is crispy, which appears to be two thirds of the time. The potato/pasta salad is awful.  The potatoes are consistently undercooked and it is very bland with mostly just mayo and lacks the bite or a good mustard and salt and pepper; avoid it.  The short-rib chili on brisket is good as is the regular chili.  This place is okay. The door is open for \\"ventilation\\" supposedly buy they bring it almost closed and achieve the same thing or just prop the small for open. The staff moving around doesn't find it as cold as the patrons. On a truly cold day the door is closed and smoke fills the place from the kitchen. At other times the road noise and passing trains keep the place from ever being quiet. The staff is almost always helpful and polite.

The d√©cor is minimal and modern.  It's softly lit and makes use of open space, communal wood tables, and touches of brightly colored, fresh vegetation.  It's a welcome breath of fresh air in the O4W and Georgia, in general.  I am a firm believer in supporting local farmers, small businesses, and sustainable practices.  The entire concept behind Dynamic Dish appeals to me on multiple levels and I frequent restaurants with similar practices and objectives on the West Coast.\\n\\nThat said, two things about Dynamic Dish struck me as incongruous to the friendly neighborhood destination it seeks to be.\\n\\n1. It's not friendly.  That totally goes against the friendly neighborhood thing.  There's a palpable air of eco-pretension.  I just made that word up, but you know what I mean.  It's very earthy and if you're not wearing your hand-dyed hemp clothes and winter beard, you barely receive any acknowledgment.  We dined on a weekday at 6:30 pm. There were only two other people there and we were asked if we had a reservation.  We admitted [quizzically] that we didn't and looked around the empty room and at each other. Some of the unoccupied tables had small reservation cards that read \\"8:00 pm.\\"  Others said nothing. We were then offered seating at the \\"bar.\\"  The bar is actually the table where the cash register is housed.  It suited us just fine because we aren't averse to bar seating and we had plans in the not so distant evening to tend to.  We left at 7:15 pm, walking by still unoccupied tables.\\n\\nService wasn't particularly attentive nor dismissive; just fine. This wasn't the case for other patrons, who were gregariously welcomed and greeted. I certainly wasn't looking for a hug or an orgasm, but some warmth or personality in a purported thoughtful and conscientious establishment seems appropriate.   \\n\\n\\n2. The prices aren't justified, no matter how precious the produce may be.  We shared two small bowls of soup and a sandwich [the entr√©e wasn't anything that interested us] and the bill totaled almost $40 [eta 2/23/09: checked my receipt after being blasted by a DD employee and it turns out my bill was $35, not $40.  My bad, but the point remains the same].  Granted, $40 is not a lot for dinner - if you actually consumed an entr√©e and/or find yourself sated.  But to spend almost $40 only to have to go find a real meal elsewhere only a half hour later, it makes less sense.  The two soups that evening were beet with horseradish and cr√®me fraiche [it was fine, but I've had much better at Russian dives] and a winter stew with lentils and spelt berries that sounded positively divine.  It wasn't. It tasted like grass and Seasonal Affective Disorder.\\n\\nThe sandwich was arugula, granny smith apples, and cheese [a very potent, yummy cheese whose name currently escapes me].  Anyhow, that too was $10.  It wasn't on particularly robust or enthralling bread.  It didn't possess any butters, dressings or spices. It was simply an apple and cheese sandwich. Tasty and healthy, sure.  Deserving of ten dollars? Not if I can help it.\\n\\nIt's prohibitively expensive for the average person and makes vegetables seem a luxury.  Organic foods are more expensive, yes, but the end product simply doesn't warrant the price point, no matter your noble intentions. At some point, you're simply ripping people off in a very environmentally sound way.  \\n\\n\\nOur communities are starving for unprocessed foods and healthier options.  I haven't written it off completely because I want to believe in them and have them succeed.  Their menu changes every day and it's statistically improbable that I won't find something that delivers in every way imaginable.  I will probably give DD another opportunity, but it suffices to say my first experience was wildly underwhelming."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place represents the quintessential Bengali/ Bangladeshi cuisine, with all its subtleties. I love the lamb dhansag here. The dish is made with meat cooked in pureed pulses. The fish dopiyaaza is delicious, too. It is quite unlike what Indians would expect from a \\"dopiyaaza\\", but the Panahar chef's rendition of this dish deserves accolades. This dish is close to what Bengalis would call \\"butterfry\\" at home.

Their selection of sweet doughy oddities is excellent. They even have rotating displays of all their donuts for those who are indecisive - which is a big reason for the perpetual lineup. There was a family in front of me buying 3 boxes who decided on having a summit meeting before picking each donut. They also offer pre-selected dozens in the hope to expedite things but to little avail.\\n\\nI ended up with only 9 donuts (split 5 ways) due to their sheer size and my fear of developing diabetes. We still ended up having sone for breakfast. Most fancy ones range from $1.25-$1.75 with a few  exceptions. The notables were the Fruit Loop, Captain crunch, and No-name (rice crispies, chocolate, and caramel) donuts. I also grabbed a plain powdered for comparison - it was good but not spectacular.  \\n\\nThe store is tiny and looks like it was decorated by Willy Wonka.

In fact, a few people tried to buy the box off me once I had walked a few blocks away.\\n\\nIf you're visiting the city for the first time this is a must stop.

Not sitting in front of a busy street is a bonus, although if you like people watching, the front patio can also be fun. Inside the restaurant always seems to be fairly crowded, but I have never seen the front patio full, so for a small group you're not likely to have a long wait. \\n\\nThe food is somewhat hit or miss. I've had a couple of the tartines and really like the goat cheese with olive tapenade. The tapenade is intense and you'll have to spread it out as it is just a dollop in the middle of the sandwich. It's rich and bursting with flavor, and a nice complement to the goat cheese. I was not very impressed with the ricotta and fig tartine. The ricotta was bland and after one slice I was pretty bored with it. The goat cheese salad with pine nuts it's quite enjoyable. (I have a thing for goat cheese, did you notice?) It's also quite a decent portion. I think ordering a salad and tartine and splitting it with someone is definitely the way to go. If you're feeling a little more adventurous than a salad and sandwich, the mussels are delicious. A hefty serving in a delicious white wine sauce. \\n\\nThe service is fine.

Although this bowl of soup left us both feeling quite satisfied, we both ordered the shrimp and grits as entrees. Needless to say, we both had enough left over for another meal.

The place has the perfect divey atmosphere for a pizza joint, with ANOTHER location right next door that seems mostly take-out. Home Slice cares so much about the customer experiencing the best pizza possible, they don't serve slices between 6:30-9:30, likely because this is when things get slow and it's more likely you'll get a slice that isn't as fresh as they like (one theory anyway).

Sunday brunch. Arrive. 20 minute wait. No prob. Order drinks and wait. Get a table up front, and settle in. Had a chance to peruse the menu waiting, but hadn't made decisions. Waitguy shows up, we order the sausage flight-four sausage patties, biscuits, butter and jam, according to the menu, should make a great starter. He tells us that everything will come out at once, so we ought to just go ahead and order everything. (Feeling rushed) Sorry, we're not ready. Okay, I'll put the first in. Walks away, turns around, comes back and says flight comes with eggs, how do you want them? Thinking shit, that's a whole meal, more than we bargained for. Again feeling rushed, scrambled. He walks off. SO says we should've ordered over-easy. Catch waiter and ask for change. Already turned in, but I'll see. Waitguy returns for order says egg order changed. Feeling like the starter was going to be too much food and a little miffed about being rushed earlier, I decline to order more. SO orders Texas Benedict. Sausage arrives. Server can't tell us what the sausages are. Waitguy comes by and can identify two, but has to go back to the kitchen to find out the others. Two patties good(? or just spicier and therefore more memorable), the other two-meh. Cheddar biscuits fine. Begin wait for other entr√©e (the one that was going to come out at the same time, remember?). And wait. Waitguy comes out to apologize and says it will be 2-3 more minutes. So we wait. And wait. And wait. Waitguy comes back to comp drinks for wait. I just want to go home. Benedict arrives. It's all really bland. No noticeable spice to the JALAPENO Hollandaise. Pulled pork dry and flavorless. Cheddar biscuit fine. \\n\\nI've been to Frank several times-both for brunch and dining and had good experiences. So I bought two Groupons for the restaurant a couple of weeks ago. Now, I'll never go back for brunch, and I'm not all that thrilled about returning for anything else, so that Groupon deal doesn't look like so much of one, now. The waitguy realized about a third of the way through the meal that I wasn't pleased, and, to his credit he tried to make up, but it was really too late. IMO, part of successful dining out is the experience, and this was not the experience I paid for.\\n\\nThe one positive to come out of this was the perspective it provided. I think the perceptions of my initial experiences at Frank possibly led me to give their food more credit than it was due; frankly, I've purchased far better sausages and meats from local artisan vendors at local farmers markets. The critical view this trip allowed made me realize that a niche approach can only carry you so far if your food (and/or service) isn't up to snuff."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I never heard of this place until i was headed to Portland, then all my friends freaked out about Voodoo Doughnuts.

It was like $5-6 (pre-tax and tip) on top of what was already a pretty expensive meal, and the cake was tiny.

The citrus dressing on the micro greens salad is a good accompaniment for the fish and adds a little bit of acid.

There was a fair amount of foie gras on the plate, and when everything was paired with the cauliflower puree, it was divine.

Both went awesome together.\\n\\nMy only two complaints was the time to get my food and the prices. The first might have been due to me sitting outside but basically it took 30 mins or so to finally get my food (two Chicago dogs and a basket of waffle fries). About 8 mins for someone to finally take my order and another 15-17 mins to get my order. Don't really know if it was my seating location. I might have been better attended inside. Next time I will try their service inside. Also I went there during lunch. Maybe they were short staffed.\\n\\nThe other was the price. $5.25 for a Chicago style hot dog I think was a little too much. Then another $5.95 for the waffle fries. Again, way too much.

So armed with great expectations and a sweet tooth that make Yogi Bear proud my friend and I buy into it and wait in the long line. 20 minutes later we bought several doughnuts including voodoo, peach fritter, fruit loop, ODB, bacon maple, maple custard, and oreo so we could be fair that if there was one we didn't like there were other options. First, the counter service girl had the personality of a wall. Not friendly, no smile, no personality, and act like we should be honored to have her wait on us. This seems to happen a lot when employees work at a \\"tourist hot spot\\" and think they are rockstars and service never gets better since they know people will still show up. Second, the actual product... overrated. Voodoo filling was subpar, frosting had a weird flavor, and seemed too doughy. Bacon maple to me had a burnt piece of bacon which took away from the flavor although in concept it should have worked. This was probably my friends best doughnut out of the bunch since she said she likes more crispy bacon, which I countered no there is \\"creole\\" and there is burnt. Fruit loop was disgusting. Imagine leaving fruit loops out on the counter for 2 weeks then put  on a doughnut with frosting and letting them get soggy. Peach fritter in my opinion had the most potential but had so much frosting it became gross to eat. You had to scrap off 90% just for it to be eatable but once you do it was probably the only doughnut that was decent to me. Maple custard was \\"ok\\" but not worth the hype. After eating just those doughnuts we had enough and tossed the rest in the trash. \\n\\nOverall, this place is not going anywhere since its a tourist place and has some devoted fans but in my opinion this place calling card is more about being weird and a \\"i've been there\\" kind of place and not so much for quality of doughnuts. I would never come back since I've had better doughnuts without the hype or the weird combinations that with us at least failed on a massive scale. End result... we tossed about $20 worth of doughnuts in the trash and actually all agreed that there are several lesser hyped places heck even Krispy Kreme that make better quality doughnuts without having to be weird just to \\"keep portland weird\\"."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've wanted to try this place for years but have been turned off by the wait.

They feature a HUGE array of sandwiches on your choices of fresh breads, plus two homemade soups each day, salads, and fresh cookies.  As it turns out, I had had their food many times when they catered events at the State Bar of Georgia.  The exposed brick and ductwork and high ceilings give a funky urban edge to the attractive, spotless decor.  The employees are courteous and helpful.  The line gets long and pretty slow if you don't come early for lunch.\\n\\nSo far, I have tried the chunky chicken salad and the Cadillac chicken.  The chunky chicken salad comes as advertised, with giant chunks that could make some bread choices awkward and messy.  I had it on sliced honey wheat, which worked well.  It had maybe a touch more mayo than I'd prefer, but it worked its way into the bread and fresh tomato and romaine lettuce enough that i didn't mind.  The Cadillac chicken came out hot and tasty, and the bacon and honey mustard were welcome additions.  The jambalaya bisque was mild, and a bit bland, but some salt, pepper and Tabasco remedied that in short order.  The chocolate chip cookies are very satisfying and easily shared, even by someone like me that gets territorial about their food.\\n\\nMany pluses - attractive and comfortable, close to work (for me), high quality sandwich ingredients, MANY enticing selections, Miss Vickie's chips, free refills and no pressure to tip.  The minuses are the circus atmosphere when the lunch crowd picks up, and the prices are too high to eat this every day.  My recommendation is to come early and take your time before you order.

So when this one opened I expected the same service and quality. Well I guess I expected too much. \\n\\nI went with several co-workers for lunch pretty soon after they opened. We got there at 11:40 to beat the crowd. We were seated right away and then tried to place out drink and food orders together - and our waitress said I can only take drinks first. OK fine, but we are on an hour lunch break - we were hoping to be quick. \\n\\nShe then goes off and takes the orders of what seems like 10 other tables (the restaurant is packed now). Finally we get to put our orders in. When they bring them out they don't bring them all out at once - they do it one at a time so there are folks without food for several minutes (like 15 - too long). \\n\\nThe waitress then comes over and informs the one guy still without food that they dropped his pizza on the ground and have to remake it. At this point he asks them to put it in a to-go box because he's got a 1pm meeting (it's been 1:15 hours). We had to take the pizza back for him because he had to leave for the meeting and they still hadn't brought it out. We didn't get back to work until 1:30 or so (and we worked across the street). Two hours when we were the first people in the restaurant that day? Unacceptable. \\n\\nSubsequent visits have gone slightly better than the first, but not by much. \\n\\nFood can be hit or miss - there are some really decent things on the menu and I usually enjoy the specials, but I've definitely had a few bland things here too. I feel like they just don't have the same level of quality I got used to at the Needham location.

The atmosphere is nice and can be a little noisy, but this just let's the patrons know it's alright to enjoy yourself and have a good time.\\n\\nAs for the pizza, it's delicious. Thin crust with just enough sauce and always comes out super hot. Add some red pepper and you are ready to go. I generally go for the less is more attitude when it comes to toppings. I haven't disliked any of the combinations that I've tried so far. Last time I had the pepperoni and mushroom and it was great.\\n\\nIf you're not in the mood for pizza, the sandwiches here are awesome. I picked up the Italian sandwich for lunch one day and it was pretty amazing. The only problem I had was that the bread got a little soggy from the oil&vinegar...but I think that was my own fault because I had the bag turned upright during the car ride back to work.  I haven't had it, but I hear the Meatball Sub is pretty amazing too. I've seen it being prepared...after the meaballs are put into the bread, they cover it with cheese and put it into the oven to get it extra hot. I gotta try it.\\n\\nWhat else... ah, the salads. I usually stick with the house salad and it hasn't ever treated me wrong. If you have a group of three or four and you all want salad, they offer a Family Style which is a big bowl that everyone can share. It's enough for everyone and saves you some $$. My friend got the Caesar and I tried the dressing and did not like it. I think that might be the one thing from here I've tried and didn't like.\\n\\nFor dessert, try getting curb-stomped into one of the giant rice crispy treats they have. \\n\\nOk, well, this review is long, but really, you could have just trusted me and stopped reading after the first line.

Just the right amount of crunch with the right amount of chew.  I've had Home Slice dozens of times over the years, but I must post something.  Located in the now touristy/trendy South Congress area, Home Slice is anything but a touristy restaurant.  It's a thin New York style pizza with a traditional Neapolitan crust, and it's done right.  In Austin, only Backspace, Frank & Angie's, and Bufalina can truly rival Home Slice for a traditional Neapolitan pizza, but it really is the standard by which any new entrant to the scene should be measured because they are unquestionably the best.\\n\\nStaff are always delightful, and they will remember you after just a couple visits.  Nice little touch: If you order take away, they will even make your pizza so it will be ready at a specific time...to the minute!  That way, you can go grab your beer or cokes at HEB first and know exactly how long you have to get there before it's in the window.  That means, for example, that if at 8:20 you realize you will be a few minutes late, you can call up and ask them to make it 8:40 instead of 8:35.  Who else does that, and why the hell not???  \\n\\nTonight, we had a Greek salad and a large pizza with pepperoni, hot peppers, basil, fresh tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella.  Delicious as always!  I've never encountered a negative of any kind at Home Slice, and I highly doubt I ever will.  They use the freshest, highest quality ingredients available.  The sauce, toppings, and crust all compliment one another perfectly, and the result is simply wonderful!  If you want a great pizza in Austin and you haven't yet tried Home Slice, you've already screwed up.  Get your $h*t together.

It literally takes it's name quite seriously as the place is a small tavern location and feels like a dive bar.  However, the end result is a pleasant surprise.  \\n\\nWe got the truffle fries out of all the praise it got on Yelp.  Surprisingly enough, although it wasn't a taste that was different from the norm, it was addicting from the first bite to the last.  A unique ketchup would push the appetizer over the edge.  For the entrees, I got the potato gnocchi.  Although I'm not a huge fan of gnocchi in marinara sauce, they utilized a short beef rib marinara variation that was pretty darn tasty.  The gnocchi was also not too small and flavorful as well.  My friends got the chicken Parmesan which was solid as well but nothing too mind-blowing.  The meal was also pretty cheap - for a bottle of white wine, two entrees and an appetizer, it was about $50.  They also gave us bread and a salad.  The bread sauce was quite unique - peppers mixed with olive oil and garlic.  A bit spicy and scrumptious.  \\n\\nAnchovies is a highly surprising little location.

This was followed by a glass of champagne and duck confit. Then came the best scallop dish I've ever had in my life. Two seared scallops served with fresh yellow tomatoes, capers, and a delightful citrus cream sauce. I can't wait to try something like this myself. Thank goodness the food was a tasting portion (though generous) because I really had reached a satisfying fullness by the fourth dish! and there was more! By the time they brought out the filet of beef accompanied with a puff pastry crusted gratin potato and spear of grilled asparagus, I had reached capacity! The wine kept coming, the flavors grew in complexity, and the experience was gluttonously amazing. The wine pairings were incredibly tasteful. The only surprise came in getting a cold beet salad as the last course. Unexpected but also delicious. \\n\\nMy recommendation is to go on a very empty stomach and get ready for the meal of a lifetime.

Great for dipping the leftover crust! \\nMargherita - My favorite, Only because they didn't skimp on the olive oil but it wasn't a slick fest either. Tomatoes were juicy and fresh and mozzarella gooey! \\n\\nThe only reason I docked one star is because I've had better and out slices came out luke-warm.

The first time we went there, we went sort of on a whim when heading to another place.  One of the stipulations for lunch on that particular day was that we were going to be bringing back food for a colleague.  Turns out, that is a a no-no at Pizzeria Locale, as is getting a pizza precut, or sliced.  This was an irritant, as without us bring back food, he was not going to eat.  After explaining this to our waiter, he brought over a manager who explained their policy of no togo and no slicing, to which we had to reexplain our situation.  Eventually they relented, and gave us a pizza togo, but that was annoying.  In the realm o f other weird service experiences at Locale, there was another time I was there and in delivering a try of beverages, our water spilled the remainder of a bottle of beer on the back of an associate of mine.  Instead of really trying to rectify the situation, the service there got embarrassed and really wasn't much help.  Poor indecent management indeed.  \\n\\nNow with those things in mind, when it comes to the pizza itself, it truly is top notch.  I have had several of the offerings on the menu, and have loved everything I have tasted.  This truly is a gourmet pizza experience, if your idea of good pizza is from Pizza Hut, this is not your place.  If you are one of those people that think either New York or Chicago style is the only way to have a pizza, this also is not your place.   If you are someone that truly recognizes and appreciates quality ingredients served in a traditionally delicious manner, you must give this place a try.  As said before, i have tasted several, and loved all I have tasted, but my favorite is certainly the maize pizza, it is fantastic.  \\n\\nBeing attached to frascas, the wine selection is extraordinary as well.  A very robust bottle and glass list. \\n\\nOn a whole, I am a fan of this place and aside from the weird service issues I listed above, I have had pretty great experiences here, I highly recommend it, and while you should vacate thoughts of a typical pizza place when you walk it, you should also try it."},{"name":"Crispy Cr√™pes Cafe","address":"714 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have to say that Paris Creperie is a bit better over in Coolidge corner.

Besides the usual rice, beans, and veggies, they also have mac-n-cheese, fried plantains, and these things called yucca fries. I asked what a yucca is and apparently it's like a healthier version of a potato. Whether that's true or not, it's a must-try item. It's a little drier and starchier than regular potato fries but if they served these at other fast food places, I would definitely get them. If it's your first time, they'll also give you a sample cup of their side items to try.\\n\\nThere are several combo options to structure you meal. A whole chicken with 2 sides are quite enough for 2 people. They even have a drive-thru window b/c their services are fast enough to accommodate for the speed.

He also made it clear that with the extensive menu, he could help alot if we had to choose among several items. For our appetizer we chose the celeriac gnocchi, made from sage butter, sweet potato cream, saut√©ed kale, candied pecans. It was so good, my husband and I polished it off in about a minute flat and could have probably licked the bowl clean.\\n\\nFor our main course, I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Tempeh and my husband ordered the Reuben, which is also made with tempeh.  My meal was nice and jerk-spicy and he praised the full flavor of his sandwich.  Throughout our meal, Devin was very attentive, making sure we had plenty of water and he seemed pleased that we really enjoyed our food.\\n\\nI was still recovering from a moderate bout of acute mountain sickness, having just descended earlier that morning from the Rocky Mountains. Devin heard me talking about how much better I was feeling at the lower elevation and recommended that I continue to drink plenty of water and get some vitamin C or other antioxidants. But then, he brought out a large (and complimentary!) cup of rooibos tea,  which he recommended would help with the congestion I was still experiencing. It was such a sweet gesture.\\n\\nWe probably didn't need dessert especially after that sweet and delicious gnocchi, but we ended up going with the chocolate peanut butter tart.

Four of my church member and I went to Mary Macs yesterday for dinner and a meeting and had a seemingly good waiter that made an honest mistake but wouldn't own up to it. One order for the table was not pushed through and our friend had to sit and watch us eat our entire meal before her shrimp and grits were brought out. At that point she was so hurt at the disregard she declined the meal. She was so upset the food off our plates we offered her couldn't console her. She didn't want to make a fuss so I asked could her meal simple be boxed to go so she could enjoy it at home and her meal comped since her dinning experience was ruined. That was denied and we were told the meal had to be accounted for so she would be charged. A \\"small\\" discount was offered. She declined it all because of the principle of the matter. The waiter lied and told her he sent her meal back when he saw it up because he didn't think it would be to her liking. The manager said the order actually was on hold and never pushed through because he came back to clear up someone else's order and forgot to complete hers. Not our problem! I am fairly certain we looked as if we just wanted a handout and they are used to people asking for their meals to be comped but the truth of the matter is my friend was wronged. I'm a physician and all of us are business owners and executives in our positions. We could pay for the whole rooms meals without batting an eyelash. We were not looking for a handout rather a wrong to be made right and an apology. I have never been to a restaurant that is as busy as Mary Mac's is and had a policy that they could not comp meals.

I couldn't pass it up. We got two glasses of wine, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert all for like $65. It was an awesome deal.\\n\\nWe get here and the place looks amazing. There are several different types of chairs and candles and they're all spread throughout the place. It looks very eclectic and I liked it. \\n\\nThe appetizer we chose was the P.E.I. Mussels (Spicy Sausage, Tomato, Garlic, Parmesan-Truffle Broth). This was the bomb. The mussels were perfectly cooked, and the cooking liquid that it was served in was fantastic. The parmesan-truffle broth was beyond delicious, and the spicy sausage pieces throughout were yummy, too. All the flavor from it jumped into the mussels, and wow. It was served with bread so we could dip, and, in fact, if I had a spoon, I might have eaten the whole dang bowl as if it were soup. Not sure that's how you're supposed to do it, though..\\n\\nAnywho, the entrees we chose were both the Porcini Dusted Filet Mignon (Smoked Mushroom Duxelle, Oven Roasted Roma Tomatoes, Horseradish Aioli, Blistered Asparagus). We didn't want to share a dish that sounded like that, so we both got one. \\nThe filet itself was cooked perfectly at a medium rare all the way through, and the sear on it was nice, too. Salt and pepper on point. The chef knew what he was doing with this.\\nI had no idea what mushroom duxelle was when I ordered this, but image a mushroom puree and go check out my picture of it. It was yum. It was like a sauce-ish, but that was pure mushroom. Omg good.\\nThere was one tomato on my plate, and it wasn't roasted to the level I would have liked.\\nThe aioli was great, too. I avoid horseradish like the plague. It's too harsh, but this aioli was flavored with it, but not too much. It was super buttery and it was slathered on the steak, so it was unavoidable, but I didn't want to avoid it. Yum.\\nAnd the \\"blistered\\" asparagus was not blistered. It was barely roasted. \\nIn addition to the menu items, there was a red, super sweet sauce on the plate, too, that was a great addition. Everything mixed together was awesome.\\nDefinitely not the best steak I've ever had in my life, but this was hands down the best steak dish I've ever had in my life. The only things that let me down just a little were the side veggies, but that's ok. I still fell in love that night.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the Macallan 12 Yr Butterscotch Pudding (chantilly cream, sea salt chocolate toffee). The toffee piece on top was delish. I love sea salted sweets. The pudding itself was very butterscotch-y. Like a super Worther's Original, but in pudding form. There was also legit vanilla bean inside the pudding that added a great amount of texture. The dessert was good. It was served in a tiny little cute mason jar, too. Good way to end the meal.\\n\\nOverall, this meal was awesome. Well worth the price of the Groupon, so be on the lookout for another one. I would say that it was worth the price outright, but I'm not in that tax bracket as of now. Either way, yes, come here.

You also smell every bite as it passes by on its way to your mouth- playing a big role in your overall taste experience.\\n \\nAnd man, oh man, did the food at Poor Calvin's smell (and taste) DIVINE!\\n \\nBASIL ROLLS: Perhaps the most disappointing- and not even bad. Just very simple and fresh tasting.\\n \\nGRILLED LAMB RACK: By far and away, the BEST lamb dish I've ever had. The rack was cooked to perfection- tender and juicy- and the flavor was killer! The curry sauce had fantastic flavor that complimented the meat perfectly. I highly recommend this dish if you plan on visiting any time soon.\\n \\nFRIED CHICKEN: I ordered this for me alone, but it could've easily fed two people. The chicken pieces were huge, and they did not skimp on the lobster mac n' cheese! Once again, good flavor- none of that nacho cheese junk- and a wonderful texture on the chicken.\\n \\nRED VELVET CAKE: What's that phrase, again.... I CAN'T EVEN! This was so good. Like I would fight rush hour Atlanta traffic, pay $10 to park downtown, and trudge through these awful 20-degree temperatures just to get a piece-good. Two medium-size layers of red velvet cake sandwich a HUGE layer of sweet ricotta filling with mango tapioca balls and a delicious green (yes, green) caramel sauce on top. And it's HUGE! Yet, between four of us, it was still gone in like 30 seconds flat. And the aftertaste it leaves is surprisingly pleasant. I was happily licking my lips all the way home.\\nAnd the other dessert options sounded just as good- Don't skip dessert here!\\n \\nUnfortunately, I was not as impressed with the space as I was the food. The venue is small, which is fine, but also very cramped. I know they are trying to meet demand, but we were almost back-to-back with the table next to us.\\nAlso, it was SO DARK. Mood lighting is nice, but I could barely see my plate.\\n \\nNOTE: Mondays are a fantastic night to go- plenty of parking, no waiting for a table, and HALF PRICE WINE BOTTLES!

Never had this experience at any chipotle when ordering in person, and because this has happened twice with online orders, I can only conclude that they think they can get away with this because the customer is not watching them make the food.

But that's ok, the bar is a huge wrap-around with plenty of room to not only drink but eat.\\n\\nThe hostess was welcoming and the waitress was helpful and attentive all night and pointed out the delicious Happy Hour special of a $4 Angry Bird.

It's a struggle to find a non-spicy or non-Southwestern black bean burger in the veggie world but this was the perfect substitute for a juicy burger and combined with red pepper sauce, fresh tomato, and spinach on soft-yet-crispy foccacia - I died. I'm afraid of how close I live - I'm going to be ordering carry-out every day.

This never-ending barrage of deliciously-new-and-improved takes on classic-but-uninspired bar food? NO. No, it's not. They were tempura green beans, nice and light flaky breading around tender bean and amazing sweet sauce. And here comes the melt-in-your-mouth buttery pretzels with chive dipping sauce. Oh and on your left you will see the Apple Pie burger and your friends practically inhaling it's goodness.\\n\\nYou can build your own burger but I would leave that up to the professionals and try every single innovative, taste-bud-exploding, burger on the menu first. Only when you've tried every single one of them would I build my own, which was tempting with such a great list of toppings, breads, and sauces.\\n\\nAtmosphere: sports bar but WAY better. I'm typically not a huge sports bar fan, but this didn't feel like one at all, at least not in the traditional sense. There were screens, but they were limited to over the bar instead of plastered on every wall. The ceilings were more than \\"vaulted\\" - they were sky high so there was an amazing open-feel to the whole place. In general, it was huge, not only compared to typical places in Grandview but Columbus in general. The lights were low and the place had a comfortable, warm feel. The stage area looked great and I know it would be really fun to see music there. I really can't wait to visit the patio in nicer weather.\\n\\nOverall: I'm coming back AND SOON.

I'd try to go two other times, but the wait was just too long. Now with Faveroo in hand on a Tuesday evening, we actually got immediately seated.\\n\\nOur server was wonderful. She was a highlight of the evening. Efficient, friendly, considerate, and overall cool. \\n\\nThe food was not a good as I hoped. I had over hyped it. Items that shined were the seasonal salad, a panzenella which was amazing, bread, parm, tomatoes, onions, and an orange vinaigrette that really made the dish. I wish the Ohio tomatoes had more flavor this year. Every Ohio tomato I've had so far this season's been bland, no matter where I've gotten them from. It's a shame. The other winner was the pepperoni pizza we ordered. Nice chewy thin crust, flavorful sauce, right amount of cheese and toppings. Good work. The burger and fries were a real fail. Obviously a problem with execution in the kitchen, the burger was over charred and the burnt flavor over powered the sandwich and the fries were soggy and seemed like they weren't double cooked. The aioli lacked a brightness I expected from lemon and fresh herbs. Overall a disappointment. \\n\\nThe bill for a beer, iced tea, and items mentioned above was$42 before tip. Not bad, but all the prices were about $3 higher than their online menu has them listed and the burger was not a $12 burger. \\n\\nLast thing to speak of is the ambiance and I just wasn't feeling it.

I had the papardelle with chicken livers, and my friends had the spaghetti with tomato sauce, gluten-free tagliatelle with duck ragu (my fave of them all...the best gluten-free pasta I've ever had, for sure!), and tagliatelle with mussels.

As our food is being placed on our table, the restaurant manager approaches us and informs us that dogs are not allowed in the courtyard. We told her that we had called to make sure and brought a dog several times before, and that the other staff didn't seem to have an issue with it but she insisted dogs had never been allowed here and that we either had to leave or move to the front patio (uncovered and no heat). We told her we would either stay and eat with our dog where we were under cover and heat or leave without paying. She offered then to grab a tray and move us all to the front patio so e decided that our business would be suitable elsewhere where we were not given contradicting information and confronted by such a rude manager.

When he suggested Thai food....my answer was Duh??  My co-worker asked around about some places and Typhoon Thai came highly recommended.  So we headed out for a late dinner.  Took awhile to get there simply because parking in the NW district of Portland proved difficult.  But the area pops with activity and teems with multiple business, restaurants, and specialty stores, so be prepared for traffic and parking spot hunting.  \\n\\nOnce we found parking, we walked to the restaurant and chose to eat on the small make shift patio.  The larger tree covered patio had no room, so we made do where we sat.  The patio borders their small parking lot, so car fumes and bad drivers may be a risk, but the food is worth it.\\n\\nWe started off with the duck filled fried Spring Rolls.  The kitchen cooked these exactly the way a friend wrapped roll should be fried.  The wrapping looked golden brown, and the texture balanced between crispiness, just a bit of grease, and salt.  The stuffing of moist and rich tasting duck meat mingled with the crisp vegetables inside to create a nice symphony of flavors.  The sweet sauce condiment added a bit of sweetness, however, I had hoped for something more spicy.  Overall, a great appetizer to start.\\n\\nFor the main course, my co-worker ordered a special fish dish, wrapped in a banana leaf, and steamed to tenderness.  The fish dish came with a garlic, lime, cilantro sauce, which I rank Okay by my standards.  The sauce proved a nice compliment for the fish.  The fish tasted moist and tasted flaky, with a mild sprinkle of salt and spices.  The banana leaf did not infuse as much fragrance or flavor as expected, but we found the dish delicious and unique.  \\n\\nMy main course:  Green Curry Chicken.  The curry dish hit the spot, but I admit I ordered a safe standard and refrained from Typhoon's specialty items.  The curry had ample veggies and meat.  The dish tasted a bit sweet for my liking, but still served to massage my taste buds to joyful bliss.  The chicken slices soaked up the flavor of the coconut milk and curry very well, and I drenched my steam rice with the curried milk.  Each bite prompted another. \\n\\nWe ate everything, and we left satisfied.\\n\\nFor dessert I ordered a coconut drink.  A sweet summer beverage bursting with coconut flavor, filled with huge chunks of coconut meat, and lots and lots of sugar.

There was a lot of use of fresh fruit used in the rolls, which I actually found to be a good combo. \\n\\nMy biggest gripe with them (and the reason they didn't get 5 stars) is that they tend to over-sear their food.  The tuna tartare came almost cooked through...as did the seafood eggplant cheese dish and some other rolls.

My family choose J Liu for a 30-40 person celebration of life after my moms funeral. We had family coming in from all over and wanted to have a place to gather and celebrate her life. Saturday from 12:30-2:30 was our reserved spot room was set for 30 and I told them it could grow to 40. This is where the \\"only problems with no solutions\\" started to take place from the manager at J Liu. As our party grew to 35 mind you 4 of those were kids I was told that the room was only set for 30 and that the additional parties members would not be allowed to sit in the room and would have to order off the restaurant menu. I had picked a limited menu for are guest to choose from but keep in mind everything i picked was on the current restaurant menu so not sure why it made any difference. Also we had ordered and paid for are own servers and bar tender as part of our guaranteed minimum for booking the room. Again there was absolutely nobody else in the restaurant or bar and we were the only clients.  After much deliberation and key family members saying they would be willing to sit in a booth outside the curtain that separated the room the family decided we could added some extra chairs to tables and moved some of the kids to a booth that was inside the designated space. Management was not happy with this and again said that the additional customers would not be served and reminded me we had a strict 2:30 end time. Off course when I booked the room we had all the time in the world just that the bartender was only booked for the 2 hours even though I had to pay for a 3 hour minimum which I agreed to. They servers in the room who by the way were great agreed to set some place settings for the kids and the 4 additional chairs. The food was ordered around 1:30 served around 1:50 and we ate and drank all the time watching the OHIO State Michigan State game that was on the tv in the room we reserved. At promptly 2:30 a manager came in gave us our bill and turned the TV off we had not even finished our desserts yet, which cost us an additional $6 per person but the servers acted as if it was included in the meal. As we were shuffled out as if the restaurant was closing? Not asked if we would like to gather in the bar or hang around for some drinks just shuffled out. We now had to invite people to our home which was exactly what were were trying to avoid in the first place! $1600 bill and treated with complete disrespect. When I asked to talk to the manager in private to express some of my displeasure with the way she handled us her response to me was I do not have time for you! Well that was certainly true and I now completely understand how there was nobody in your restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.

So, he brought the pizzas, I asked to see the wine list again since he scurried it away so quickly after just ordering 2 glasses..I would have asked for the wine list again way before then so we could have enjoyed wine with out pizza..but like I said I couldn't get his attention for anything. He acted as condescending and gave a strange look when we ordered a bottle of red with our pizzas, as if we couldn't afford it, which I see why there's other snobby remarks referring to this restaurant with the service.\\n    The pizzas: were tasty, but taken out of the oven too quickly and soggy bottom crust. Also, am I the only one who noticed \\"where's the sausage?!\\" on any of the pizza selections? Other tables pizza variations looked good though, so they may have been..but yea ours was just mediocre. So as we finished our pizzas I sneaked off to ask the waiter for simple little desert with a candle for my partner's birthday..and after discussing it with him he basically told me in other words, \\"don't worry it won't cost that much\\"..I had, had with the waiter at that point..I am very well traveled and wasn't really worried about the cost, and never once even brought the cost up, and also considering it was a special occasion dinner, one tends to spend a bit more without usually getting frowned at or questioned.  I still gave him a decent tip because I've worked in the restaurant bizz and know that everyone can have their bad days. BUT, the desert, the pudding, was friggen fantastic!! So the whole thing wasn't a drag..good apps, good wine, mediocre pizza, and good desert...awful awful service. I would probably only come back to this place if it was for lunch or something when it's not too crowded and ask for the pizza to be left in the oven a little bit longer!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is a old Portland food landmark.

We originally planned on attending a cookout on a base ball field there in East Point but it was way too congested with no parking so, we decided to have some fish as North of Atlanta has limited places to get this type of fish I usually eat here when I'm on this side of town. Bad move. 2 hours after I finished eating, my stomach started feeling weird. I was not surprised since my fish was not cooked on the inside to temperature. The outside was very crispy but the inside was soft and mushy like they dropped the fish in hot grease and it cooked too fast. I also had the shrimp and the inside still had raw batter.  I was totally disappointed. My stomach still feels off today. My Mom called to ask how my stomach felt because she had diarrhea all night.  I gave 2 stars because the restaurant is in it's new location and it's really nice with outside seating. The prices remained the same which is good. I don't like that they charge 4% to pay with credit or debit, luckily, my mom had cash. The coleslaw is always good. I think the problem is the young cooks preparing the food and may need some additional training on food handling and cooking food to proper temperature. I have to add that I have patronized this restaurant for many years while living in the area and even the last few years, driving from Norcross.  I probably won't be eating here again since the last few times were not great either. I'll probably drive over to Yasins on Old National Hwy when I'm craving fish again where they offer  sweet potato fries as a side option and don't charge 4% to use a Debit card."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"2100 Henderson Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"This location is not on par with other Paneras.

On the weekends, they offer brunch and dinner and during the week they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. \\n\\nWe easily found parking behind the relatively small group of storefronts that also houses its sister restaurant, Wisteria. The crowd was relatively large and the host accurately predicted about a 40-minute wait. They do not offer reservations. \\n\\nThe place has a vibrant and warm feeling with decorations that align with its name. There's seating at the counter and lots of wooden, yet still comfy, booths puzzled into the relatively small space. It's an eclectic crowd with lots of twenty something's, young families, couples and others who clearly enjoy having a neighborhood destination.\\n\\nThe friendly wait staff immediately greeted us and took our drink orders. There are good selections of beers, wine, craft sodas and craft cocktails as well as the usual coffee, teas, juices and milks. The \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is a refreshing mix of vodka, strawberry jam, apple bitters and ginger. It is one of those cocktails that will sneak up on you and end any afternoon plans you might have that don't involve a nap. The Bloody Mary was good but suffered from a heavy hand with the Worcestershire and citrus. \\n\\nThe basket of small muffins was a nice brunch starter. They were moist and flavorful and didn't the need sides of housemade jam we had also ordered. They charge 25 cents apiece for their jams which is a very small amount but one would think could be factored into a $5.99 charge for 8 smallish muffins or even included as condiments on the table. \\n\\nMany of the varied Brunch dishes were good. Some were just a little off on execution. \\n\\nThe roasted pork Verde contained well-seasoned roasted pork just too little of it. The black beans and onions overpowered the dish and were missing in the menu description. The shrimp and grits with fried egg had cooked a little too long making the shrimp rubbery. The Steak Sammy's ingredients of thinly sliced ribeye steak, mushrooms, peppers and provolone needed to marry their flavors perhaps benefitting from a little longer stay on the flattop. The accompanying \\"flattop mac & cheese\\" was very good with nice crusty edges.\\n\\nThe tofu-fried hash was a m√©lange of tofu squares, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, potatoes and peppers blended with a basil pesto. It was a hardy dish with good flavor. The Angus burger was also a hit. The hand formed patty can be ordered as a double (7 oz.), triple (10 oz.) and a quad (13 oz.). There's a large choice of cheeses and other toppings. The purist at our table simply ordered it medium with American cheese and he was delighted at the result. The hand-cut fries were crisp and properly salted.\\n\\nThe lobster roll special was especially disappointing. It got the buttered, toasted, top-sliced bun replete with lettuce and tomato right but the lobster was stringy, mealy and contained many smaller pieces with very few of the large tail and claw chunks that are endemic of a properly prepared roll. Moreover the lobster was coated in a pink sauce that masked much of its flavor. Lobster rolls should be garnished with butter or perhaps a small amount of good mayonnaise... nothing more.\\n\\nFolk Art has set its course on a difficult task. While obviously not a diner, it has thrown its fate into a precarious lot that demands perfection on a variety of levels. It should be lauded for its effort and forgiven for its sometimes-spotty execution."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I want to like Frank, I really do.

As we started saying what we wanted, the bartender threw up his hands and told us to slow down; he couldn't take a big order.  He then walked away for a solid five minutes.  Problem No. 2.  Finally we get our drinks (my iced tea was in a high ball glass...gone in two sips).\\n\\nAgain, there were only five of us, and three of us were standing.  We were only taking up two stools.

We came here on a fall trip to Portland and even though it was pretty cold outside, people lined up outside to get V.D. The queue moves quickly, but as I neared the till I almost felt a building anxiety to quickly decide on what to order because we could NOT hold up the line. You don't get much of a chance to be a tourist and take pictures at this landmark because you basically move like an assembly line: order-pay-leave with your pink box. The selection of doughnuts goes around two rotating display cases with very dull looking glass, so if you're not quick enough to see through a coke bottle at doughnuts turning in a circle in front of you, you'll miss the bacon maple or penis shaped doughnuts. Not the kind of place where you can stand at the counter in an indecisive \\"Umm... Maybe one of those?\\" state. There is no place to sit and eat a doughnut or think about what you'd like to try. Come to think of it, I don't think there was a place to sit - period. This might as well have been a drive-through.\\n\\nThe doughnuts were not great. The one with fruit loops looks interesting but the fruit loops were so stale it was hard to eat it. Then there were a couple of \\"fruity\\" glazes which were so sickeningly sweet it was hard to enjoy. The doughnut itself before the glaze was no big deal, even dry, really, if I had to describe it. The best ones we tried were the oreo doughnut and the classic old fashioned glazed. The infamous maple bacon tasted good - if you like congealed bacon on a maple glazed doughnut. I think we paid more for the novelty of the place, with its quirky bumper stickers and tacky decor."},{"name":"La Brasserie","address":"1091 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I have been to La Brasserie maybe 20 times now.

Evidently (according to the history on the wall) this was considered efficient in 1937.  I love history but we've learned a lot about efficiency since then.

My fiancee had a waffle which was rather good as was the fruit salad.  Overall though, unless one is a college kid with a hangover, this is far from a culinary experience.\\n\\nSo back to the sanitary part.  We ordered a fresh carrot juice and a sangria.

Immediately, my friend burst out with his suggestion \\"Leaf!\\". Yep, got it, going.\\n\\nI managed to find free parking in the Boulder jungle (go me!). Leaf was quiet before 5pm which meant prompt service. Leaf has a superb happy hour selection ranging from drinks (draft beers, well drinks, cocktails and martinis, $3.5-6) and food (small plates, sandwiches, and salads, mostly $4.5 except for sandwiches). \\n\\nMy favorite dish was the gnocchi which my friend ordered. It was a generous serving filled with strawberry red gnocchi. Those delicious tasting things looked like strawberries and seemed well paired with walnuts and orange slices. I did start with the mizuna asian salad. Fresh bitter greens, snap peas, seaweed, all things green, seemed like a good way to start off my meal. I also enjoyed their crostini with macadamia nut \\"cheese\\" and figs. It was creative, colorful, well presented, and tasty. Finally, I finished with the pimento cheese poppers with jalapeno peach jelly. It was a great mix of soft, crunchy, and spicy. \\n\\nLeaf thoroughly filled me as I toured most their small plates.

It had a very silky cream sauce with small chunks of lobster. The ravioli was perfect. Homemade pasta shell with a good amount of sweet lobster. My wife and Son had the special which was lobster baked in a bread crumb butter and sherry sauce. This was a dish worth driving from New York to Boston for. It had extremely large pieces of lobster in every bite. It was a market priced dish at $38.00 and I would have paid more for it.

The Colonnade is my favorite restaurant.  So what am I doing eating at Mary Mac's?  Some might say I'm a traitor, others might say they're two peas in a pod.  But, each one has its own personality and living south of Ponce I can't always get up to Cheshire Bridge.\\n\\nMary Mac's scene is cinnamon rolls, walls covered with photos of famous people, celebrities and a who's who of Georgia politicians that have dined there, Jo Carter, a long time waitress who's now the Goodwill Ambassador, administering little massages served up with a deep Southern drawl and pot likker.\\n\\nThe Colonnade's scene is yeast rolls, a crowd that's gay or gray or both, gayer than a gay bar on Friday night, the strongest drinks in town, a longtime patron whose white hair is teased to the heavens and held in place by a can of hairspray (the crowd collectively held its breath when she'd light up a cigarette, before smokers were banished outside) and fried chicken.\\n\\nI prefer the food at the Colonnade and it's less expensive.  I'd say the food is healthier, too, in a nod to Mary Mac's southern cooking.  Chefs have worked to update the menu at the Colonnade, holding onto favorites while introducing specials like lobster, pasta and even the occasional exotic item like kangaroo or alligator, while Mary Mac's has stayed true to its Southern roots and offers a more extensive menu.\\n\\nFor fried chicken, tomato aspic, grilled pork chops and cream of chicken soup, I head to the Colonnade.  For turkey and dressing, pot likker, Brunswick stew and pickled beets, I head to Mary Mac's.

So we started with a small bowl of pot likker and cornbread. At first, I was not sold on pot likker. Collard green water? Sounds ... unappetizing. But it's actually really tasty. It was a bit on the greasy side for my taste, but the flavors were really rich and reminded me of a vegetarian version of chicken and mustard green soup my mom makes. I wasn't a fan of the cornbread, but I am not a big of cornbread in general. It runs a little grittier than I prefer. The rolls, however, were DELICIOUS. They were soft and warm, and with a smear of butter.. ugh, I could eat so many of these.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the chicken pot pie with fried green tomatoes and creamed corn. First of all, I'm a HUGE fan of creamed corn and this definitely did not disappoint. It had the natural corn sweetness and I'm sure a helping serving of melted butter. The fried green tomatoes were good, but not the best I ever had. I prefer the breading to be airy and flakier, whereas these breadcumbs were more dense. The chicken pot pie was great. I would have liked less gravy, given that it was really salty, and definitely makes the pastry dough soggier.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  As a heads up, there is construction happening in the parking lot of the restaurant. You have to make a pretty sharp turn into the lot, which can be hard to see at night. Please don't let that deter you, as there is valet parking which is $2. Once you get past the construction, the restaurant itself is unassuming on the outside. When the weather heats up, there is patio style seating in the courtyard. Once inside, the atmosphere is always very cool. There is an oyster bar as you walk in and a large, open dining room. Service has always been outstanding and our last waiter (Chris from NY) was phenomenal in making our dinner experience amazing! \\n\\nHere are some tips:\\n1) Come Hungry--I guarantee you that there is not 1 bad thing on the menu...you just might be tempted to overeat, maybe :-). Also, they provide buttered, salted dinner rolls that have to be the best in the history of the world, possibly (hope you're not low carb). \\n2) Try the Starters--there are numerous Starters that will knock your socks off e.g. Mussels in green curry coconut broth, she-crab soup, charred octopus...to name a few. These will give you a nice variety to taste and share. Plus, portions are appropriately sized. \\n3) Corn Milk Hushpuppies--enough said\\n4) Leave Happy--the Fish & Chips and the Duck Fat Poached Swordfish were total standouts.

We also were informed that our entire party had to be on time for our reservation in order to be seated. Our party was present for our 6:30 reservation, however we were not seated until 7:25. The dining room was empty for almost an hour as our party was scattered around the bar and neighboring tables until our table was \\"ready\\". The table I was waiting at had a menu with mac and cheese from a previous diner stuck to it. I looked over the soiled menu to choose what I would order. When we finally were seated, the menu was different from the one I looked at on the dirty table! The prices were higher. Our server: She stopped by to get our drink orders and returned twice during the entire dinner. I guess when your gratuity is automatically included, you don't have to put much effort into the service. I hope she shared her tip with her nice and attentive co-workers. The food: The oysters and the empinadas were good. The chicken, not so much. Apparently they changed the recipe and forgot to add the seasoning. Everyone in our party complained that it lacked flavor. Someone in our party ordered the steak and complained that it was bland also. I was highly disappointed due to the hype over this place. Someone I know warned me that the food wasn't good, but I wanted to see for myself. Not only was the food lack luster, but the service was also. The view from our table was beautiful though!

Even at full price, I would say that the burgers are worth it.  Grindhouse Killer Burgers is a fun bar that serves both burgers and hot dogs.  You have a choice between beef, turkey and veggie burgers.  Burgers are cooked either medium or well with a large choice of toppings. For the indecisive, there are several recommended burger styles which include the Grindhouse (American cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, and Grindhouse sauce), the Euro (Swiss cheese, mushrooms, lettuce, mustard, and mayonnaise), and the Dixie (pimento cheese, fried green tomato, cole slaw, and chipotle ranch).\\n\\nPick between one (the junior) or two patties (the double). I ordered the Grindhouse double burger with a side of the crinkle fries.  The burger was quite tasty - when cooked medium, the burgers are juicy.  Also, there is a generous portion of both cheese and sauce on the burger.  The regular crinkle cut fries are well seasoned with salt - I also tried the sweet potato fries and can say the same about them too.\\n\\nYou can sit inside or outside, either in a covered patio or in the sun.  The parking lot doesn't have a huge capacity.  Enter from Piedmont to get access to all of the parking - the entrance on the side street only allows you to reach half the spots because the driveway is one way.  The wait can be long to order at the counter, but the burgers are brought out in a reasonable time after ordering to your table.\\n\\nAs a bonus, trivia night on Monday is fun.

We personally do not care for the mushroom bacon, its dry and doesn't really taste bacony-idk it just doesn't do it for me. If you like a mushroom crouton type thing, then give it a try. The meatballs on the meatball sub are SO GUD I think you could fool any meat eater with those bad boys. The bun was a little dry and compared to the bbq sandwich, it isn't high on my list.

You can pay a bit more to get a larger size of the food. Even though shiyake ikura gohan is said to come with grilled salmon, it doesn't taste the grill flavor, just very fishy. I was in fact thinking of the salmon canned food when I ate it. The noodles and the egg are good. The broth is deep. For the ramen itself, I will give it 4 stars. My friend tried the toro-niku (pork cheek meat).

The waiter was patient to explain everything to us. I know they are busy with a lot of people waiting outside on Friday night to get in, but I really don't like the feeling that they were trying to kick us out. My friend finished her ramen earlier than me. While she hasn't even finished the broth, they asked to take her bowl away. After they took away her bowls and while I still had 1/3 to finish, they put the bill on our desk. Then again, when I haven't even finished my broth, they asked to take it away. I feel like they kept pushing us to leave early because people were waiting outside. But the broth is their signature broth and they don't even want us to enjoy it, what kind of restaurant it is? In NY, there's a super popular ramen restaurant with more than 1 hour wait in general. They never ever did that to me. But for this one, the wait is way less than 30 minutes based on my estimation of the people waiting. Just thinking of this, I don't want to come back here anymore.

The Mexican street corn is my favorite, served off the cob, the Togarashi (a Japanese chili pepper) gave it a nice kick. I also loved the brussel sprouts with yogurt - those two could be a meal for me. The burger didn't do it for me -- too ambitious in concept, the flavor felt off and the bacon spring roll toppers were cute but felt too busy and made for a greasy dish.

For months now this is the only restaurant I've heard people talking about, tried a few times to get reservations, finally had to make one weeks and weeks in advance.  It is a beautiful space- not unique or original but big and open and clean.  Of course the place was packed with hipsters on a Saturday night.  The one thing that was excellent was our server.  Unfortunately I don't remember her name but she had brown hair and cool glasses- had kind of a quirky look to her.  She was great!  Food however was just okay.  I did not get oysters, as much as I love them, I just can't bring myself to spend $3-$3.50 per oyster, especially when I know of a great place in Marietta where you can get a dozen for $9.  The she crab \\"froth\\" was just she crab soup- was good but nothing special.  I'm not sure what I was expecting with the fried smelt, but I think I was hoping for something really salty like anchovies and it just tasted like greasy fried fish with some kind of aioli for dipping.  I wanted to love the octopus- heard it was great- it was spicy and really flavorful but seemed overcooked and something about the flavors was just off to me- I wish it had something sweet in there to balance out the flavors.  I ordered the duck fat poached swordfish because it sounded amazing.  It too was just okay- seemed a bit dry even.  The best thing we had was the short rib- it was absolutely fabulous.  I thought it strange that the best thing was this considering it is a FISH restaurant.  Mexican hot chocolate for dessert was delicious but was only luke warm.  Overall, it just seemed that everything was so HEAVY.  I don't expect that when it comes to seafood.  I want lighter dishes- maybe in the spring they will offer some of those.  I would go back- for lunch or if someone else is paying- my husband and I spent $150- we can't afford to do that often.  I don't mind spending that much on an amazingly memorable meal (like we had at Tomo in Buckhead) but for just an average dinner that is way too much.  For seafood, I actually have had better meals and cocktails at Lure and as far as Rocket Farm restaurants I prefer JCT Kitchen over the Optimist.  The Sunday night dinner we had at JCT recently (at only $24) was much better than the meal we had here, and I didn't leave there feeling broke."},{"name":"Cherry Street","address":"1612 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Driving north on Lavaca, my wife and I passed by the new iteration of what was once Hog Island Deli.

The standard wine pour is always 6 or more ounces.  We have a feeling they are trying to get six glasses out of a bottle as opposed to four, a great way to improve profitability and a terrible way to start a first impression with a first time customer.\\n\\nWe had the calamari and it was pretty decent, the red sauce was marinara.  As for the soppraseta, mushroom, and fontina pizza, it was smaller than the size of a dinner plate, burned, and lacking any recognizable amount of fontina cheese.\\n\\nWe paid for the overpriced table wine and the calamari and left.  I bought a Bola Pizza from Fresh Plus and finished dinner at home.\\n\\nTo the owners, I am most saddened not by this terrible experience but rather knowing that Hog Island was a better restaurant with better food.

Service although friendly was a 2 Star.   They forgot drinks, and were beyond slow with wine and cocktails.   Appetizers were great but my entree which the server raved about was nothing special and not how it was described.   It was a pork with chorizo.  I thought it was a thick chop with subtle thin sliced chorizo for flavor.   What it was ended up as thin sliced pork surrounded by what looked and tasted like bratwurst.   \\n\\nNothing I expected or wanted.   \\n\\nNice setting but sorry to say, I can't say anyone should go here...."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"Although I feel the food has not been at the same standard as it was a few years ago, my review is based more on the way I was treated by the business owner after I left a negative review on the restaurant's facebook page. I was called heartless, rude, and accused of trying to destroy people's lives for simply stating a fact about an experience we had. My review came after we had gone in and were refused service because they were \\"closing a little early\\" on NYE, even though it was not posted on their website or facebook page, no sign on the door, and the door was open. It was 9:40PM when we walked in and the website says they were supposed to be open till midnight. Maybe we should have called first, but a simple I'm sorry would've been appropriate. Instead I was attacked for trying to make others aware that the hours posted may not be accurate. I also stated in my review that the food quality seemed to have gone downhill, and was insulted for that because they apparently have many likes and shares on social media and are well liked at local events and since I didn't agree, I'm a horrible person trying to destroy a small business and the lives of good people. (And although the back and forth is currently still on their facebook page, if the owner ever decides to try and delete his comments I have them saved to protect myself and provide proof of the unprofessional way I was treated)"},{"name":"Bistro Verde","address":"799 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a lovely concept to have a bar in a shopping mall. We are all better shoppers with a drink in us! The wait for a table can be quite long as it's still quite a new place in town and people are still flocking to check this place out. We even had to wait for a bar seat. They send you a text when your table is ready so you can shop while you wait, at least. \\n\\nI was here for a weekday drink and again for a weekend lunch/brunch. There isn't really a brunch menu but they make the lunch menu work on weekends. Drinks were quite pricey, as expected. The glazed ham sandwich was decently tasty. Fries were the thinner kind and well done. Sauce on the sandwich was tasty and mm-mmm that dip for the fries... Yum.\\n\\nI have not explored the drink menu extensively but the Malbec was fine. From the sounds of it, the coffee was OK as well. \\n\\nService was apt. We had a nice, young lady serving our table that day.\\n\\nI won't say I'm looking forward to come back but I certainly wouldn't mind dining here again!"},{"name":"Bar 145","address":"955 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"When I read that \\"Chucks, Whiskey and Burgers\\" was their theme, I thought this was a place created from my dreams. But if you take any Arena District bar and move it to Grandview...add a kitchen, a 2nd floor, a stage and a never-ending stream of early 90's rock, you'll get Bar 145. \\n\\nWe ordered the loaded truffle fries, Balsamic Bleu Burger (w/ truffle fries), and the Simpleton Burger (w/ onion fries). Our loaded fries was served with some sort of aoli. I really couldn't tell what kind of aoli it was because the flavor of mayonnaise was just way too overpowering. The fries would have been good if it wasn't drowning in bland gravy (literally, drowning, it was gravy soup topped with a side of fries). BF's balsamic bleu burger was way too heavy on the bleu, but otherwise tasty. His fries may have been the most tasty and flavorful item we had that night. My simpleton burger was waaaay too heavy on the cream cheese, unfortunately negating every other flavor in the burger. The onion fries that came with it.....5 \\"petals\\" of fried onion, laid on a pool of aoli and served with a side of some kind of sweet balsamic sauce. Our entire was a costly $50 or so, and for that price, I may as well head to Barrel44 for better burgers and whiskey. \\n\\nI think this place would be awesome for happy hour (Mon-Fri, 4-7pm), otherwise I wouldn't add this place to my list of burger joints.

Around 3pm I was able to get right in. Plus they were still making fresh doughnuts.\\nVegan Paradise, they make real donuts for vegans. Like real maple bars and specialty flavors. They don't play with those weak chalky imitations deprived vegans call donuts. \\nYour children will be exposed to the world. This includes sexually suggestive shapes and dark magic themed foods.

Then came the pizzas of all varieties.  They made a special gluten free pizza that was delicious. (I'm the one who ate that.) The person who had the vegan pizza loved it!
