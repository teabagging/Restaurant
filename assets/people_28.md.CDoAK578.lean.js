It was a perfect accompaniment to the complimentary bread.  For our meals, we went with the veal parmesan and the lobster ravioli.  Both dishes were excellent.  The veal was flavorful and tender.

Waiting or requesting an area in the main stage area is the best bet.\\n\\nThe waitstaff is super-friendly (probably expected at a Disney property) and will happily make recommendations. One touch I like is that they explicitly state what the prices of the specials are when presenting them.\\n\\nThe atmosphere feels like a traditional pub but, as they will tell you if you ask, its authentic \\"modern\\" irish food -- meaning the stuff people actually eat today in Ireland versus pure folk tradition food.\\n\\nI've enjoyed almost everything I've had there, but a few honorable mentions are their updated take on Shepherd's Pie (\\"Our Pie to Try\\") and the braised lamb shank (\\"Lambo\\") and their take on Bangers and Mash (\\"Banger and Booz\\").

I guess I've been spoiled by chain pizza establishments where I can get multiple topping choices on my pizza and so I was not thrilled about paying $26 for a pizza that I could only have one meat, either pepperoni or sausage, on it. Also, it is one size fits all. You can not choose small or medium, only large. The seating is quite limited which makes the communal style, catch as catch can seating and eating a bit cumbersome, especially if you come with a group. The pizza comes to your table via a large silver pan. There are NO plates and the cups and cutlery are plastic. Also, when I asked for some water I was directed to the sink that was off to the side of the room. Now, on a great note, it is BYOB! That is a major plus!! So, you will see people bringing in bottles of wine among other things. Lastly, I loved that the kitchen was open so we got to see the chefs tossing the dough and preparing each pizza by hand.

When we pointed this out, our server offered to replace our food, (and seemed really annoyed about it- she didn't apologize) but it was so late at that point we just decided to eat it. I had to avoid my pork, and just ate around it, which was difficult because the broth was thin and greasy. My boyfriend had to ask the server for his beer again, because she never brought it.

Fear not, a crowded restaurant is typically a good thing (unless you are trying to hit up IHOP at 2 am). \\n\\nThe overwhelming crowd inside was lively. They really pack the tables in and we jokingly invited the guests next to us to close the two inch gap between our tables and join us...they declined. Damn. I think they were more interested in the table headed by the guy yelling, \\"BRING THE KING HIS FOOD!\\" Touch√©. \\n\\nWe ordered the arancini and scarfed them down quickly. They were crispy on the outside and oozing with a mild bolognese and pea concoction inside. The bread served before the meal was a little disappointing. We expected it to be more homemade tasting  but it could be likened to a loaf of .99 cent Italian bread from stop and shop. The spread served with the bread was unique though. Our guess was that it was made of ricotta and plum tomato which was a wildcard for the premeal bread served at Italian places since all of us have only had been served olive oil. \\n\\nThe entrees were sizable and very filling. The gnocchi was dense and the tomato sauce was savory. We also tried the popular baked sausage rigatoni served with ricotta - YUM. Barely ate half of it because it was so hearty. \\n\\nI should also mention that we ordered the pomegranate sparklers. Though delish, a tiny fluted champagne glass was not a satisfying portion for the price. I think I took a shot at Dick's Last Resort later in the evening that was larger than this drink. \\n\\nOverall - there's a reason this place has a line out the door.

You can choose your milk tea to be hot or cold too.\\n\\nAnd you don't have to worry if you're hungry. Many bubbletea places don't offer a large food menu, but Estea is not one of them. They serve hot food like noodle soup, dumplings, green onion cakes, sandwiches, and various toasts. If you like sweet stuff, try the condensed milk toast -- so good! The toast is nice and thick, toasted just on the top and crusts but soft and chewy on the inside.

We had the prime short ribs and the chicken and they both were excellent, although next time I'd just go for the beef.\\n\\nYasu is great for large groups which I don't think is so common for many asian eateries (a kid was actually having a birthday party with a group of friends and family).\\n\\nThe cherry on top was when our waiter split our check five ways, with both cards and cash.

I'd have to say, Salt Lick is probably the best BBQ I've ever had.  So why the 4 stars?  There's always over restaurants out there that may be better :) I've been to many so-cal BBQ joints and none of them can be labeled legitimate.  Salt Lick has real deal meats that have been smoked for hours and you can really tell the difference by visual inspection of the smoke ring and deep smokey flavor! For those that love Phil's BBQ, all I can really say is the two are different.  Phil's popular for their tender pork ribs.  Salt's version is a little more tough but they house a different taste.  I'd give the pork ribs to Phils but it's a shame they do not have brisket!  Salt lick's brisket is so good I ate two entire plates full of it! For $19.99, you get unlimited meat and sides - what a steal!!  I'd definitely come back to Salt Lick if i'm ever visiting Texas again... too bad that may never happen!"},{"name":"Famas Pizza and Pasta","address":"5474 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Oops, I had meant to review this as the last of my Orlando trip reviews. I was feeling like some pasta on our last night, so I went on Yelp and found Famas. I was a little confused because I found two different addresses (same street but different number). Turns out Famas has a pizza take-out side and then a restaurant side. So pick either address, you will be fine. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is cozy and welcoming, with a cute little wine bar at the back. The owner and his wife were present, and joked around with us all night. One of my friends asked for a recommendation on what to order, and the owner replied, \\"Everything. Everything is good here.\\" Not too helpful for my friend, but he was speaking the truth. In the end, everyone was really happy with their dishes.\\n\\nI ordered my usual choice when eating Italian, which is the white clam linguine. It was seriously the BEST white clam linguine I've ever had. The clams were plentiful, the white wine sauce deliciously garlicky. I cleaned my plate, which NEVER happens!\\n\\nWe ordered the tiramisu after the owner mentioned that everything is made in-house, even the Caesar dressing. You can really tell they put a lot of thought and care into their food.

You can stumble into the gutter and you may hit your face on a bottle of High Life.  What you get here is beer, and the selection is even bigger and better than Brick Store Pub.  Of the beers that they both have on tap now that I compared prices of, TPBB averaged out cheaper (they have a few beers much cheaper like Brooklyn Black to a few beers slightly more than BSP like Aventitus).  TPBB has 30 taps, and none seem wasted on lame beers, while I think BSP has 27 taps, and a few are always pretty uninspired.  BSP seems a little more serious in the presentation of the beers though so I don't want to call one better than the other.\\n\\nThe one time I ate here the burger was fine, while my girlfriend much prefered the vegetarian burger at The Vortex.

If you tire of it, the Honey Crispy Chicken is equally good but trades spice for sweetness.\\n\\nBit expensive, and pretty \\"low quality\\", but absolutely delicious when it hits the spot.  3 stars for doing a few favorite dishes with a new and delicious twist.  \\n\\nWARNING: DO NOT GET THE MALA CHICKEN, ONLY THE CRISPY MALA CHICKEN.  The normal mala chicken is AWFUL, entirely unrelated to this delicious meal."},{"name":"Beijing Cafe","address":"728 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I know that this place hasn't gotten the best reviews based on its dungeon-like interior and whatnot but honestly, this place is no different from any other hole-in-the-wall cheap Chinese food places.

They're open until 11pm every day and I randomly went in to satisfy a craving I've been having. I've lived in Warren for 2 years and never went inside until tonight. The staff was nice and I couldn't find the dumplings I liked in English so I asked for them in Chinese and they were very sweet about it. $5 for a plate of home-style dumplings is okay any day in my book."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We have always loved Ruth's Chris, it has great sizzling steak and expensive crab cakes but are definitely worth the $20.

THis was our first time to the Boston Ruth's Chris, it is in the old city hall, very nice entrance, it has a good bar area which you can also get food at. The place is big and has two-three floors. The hostess directed us downstairs to a nice brickly basement with spacious tables. We got a few glasses of wine (noticed that the bottle is more expensive than glasses of wine combined for 5 of us), they have a really good and expansive wine list. Jason and I got a crabtini for appetizer, it had good chunks of crab meat marinated in spicy mayo, they also put some salad in it which we won't too crazy about it. We also got the special $40 for 5oz lobster with crab cake stuffing and a 6oz filet, very delicious. They definitely came out sizzling and smelling very delicious. Jason and I all got medium rare, and came out exactly that, but our friend Lindsay also ordered medium rare, but got medium, so she was a little disappointed.

Curry?\\n\\nIt's their comfort food.  Like biscuits and gravy to us Yankees.  And they've made it their own.\\n\\nIt's not a fiery Indian curry.  It's not an exotic Thai curry of varied colors.  It's not even something you would call Japanese if you didn't know it. Yet, it IS Japanese if you know how they think.  But it is good.  \\n\\nSimply put, Japanese curry is GRAVY.\\n\\nWhy the name Kale (pronounced kuh-lay)?  It's how the Japanese pronounce \\"curry\\".  That cracks me up.\\n\\nOn to the curry:  Kale does it very well. It is dark and dense and subtle.  Yes, you can even call it complex. Expect no heat. I think it's delicious and comforting.  Kale is the only place in Portland that makes it a specialty.  Yes, you can find the occasional Katsu curry at some of the J restaurants in PDX, but it is only one dish among many and not THIS dish.  Just talk to the friendly owner.  This brew takes some serious time to develop.  He has great pride in his creation.\\n\\nKale only does three dishes, which has probably kept people out of the restaurant in fear of a lack of variety.  Fear not.  Try it.  The Original Kale is Japanese curry gravy, nothing else.  Served over white rice.  The Kale Beef has small shreds of tender beef. No big chunks here.  Finally, the Kale Doria is beef curry with Mozarella or Cheddar broiled on top. My favorite. The cheese is carmelized into a crust that, despite your mistrust of cheese and curry, complements the tasty gravy below.   All dishes come with a sprinkling of  Japanese pickles called fujin zuke, which add a nice, lively crunch to the dish.  You can get a few beers or some soda to drink and that's it.  I don't need more because I come for the curry.\\n\\nI think if this restaurant expands its offerings it would bring in greater crowds.  I talked to the owner and he is expanding cautiously.  It's a Japanese thing, I guess.  How 'bout a Tonkatsu curry?  If Kale did this, I guarantee it would outclass anything in PDX and impress the local Japanese ex-pats.  How 'bout a chicken version?  Or a chunky stew with spuds, carrots, peas and large chunks of beef.

The restaurant decor is sparse.  The restaurant is filled with tables and a small bar that upon recollection seats no more than 6.  We were greeted upon entering and sat immediately in what was a very full room abuzz.  \\n\\nWe had the house Margarita made with freshly squeezed limes and a generous pouring of tequila.  Instead of ordering entrees, we opted for a selection of appetizers.  We started with Sopas Surtidos (Potato and Mexican chorizo, Mexican style shredded chicken and cactus salad with cotija cheese).

Next out was the Ceviche, which is my all time favorite, however Acitron makes theirs with Tilapia and while I am not a fan of Tilapia, I had to try it.  The Ceviche (Prepared with Fresh Tilapia, red pepper, cilantro, red mangoes, red onions and lime juice) was the Hidden Jewel ~ UNBELIEVABLE....the flavors were exquisite, each one complimenting the other perfectly!  Last up were the Tostadas De Tinga (Crisp golden baked tortillas topped with stewed chicken, garnished with green cabbage and chipotle sour cream).  Let me say that this was not one of my selections this evening...as I'm not normally a fan of  stewed chicken.  But I of course had to try everything we ordered.

How indulgent, but perfect for a celebration! We savored each bite ..Of course, we couldn't leave without at least sampling and sharing  dessert (although we were stuffed). Since Dad is a chocoholic we chose the warm chocolate tamale; what an interesting combination of flavors - warm, decadent chocolate and masa, superb vanilla bean ice cream and lucious cinnamon cream. And the coffee with warmed milk was a perfect ending to the meal! It was wonderful to see other families enjoying the food and each other as well (there was even a kids brunch menu!) \\n\\nBut this is not fast food Tex Mex cooking.

I got the steak, and my husband ended up ordering the wreckfish out of curiosity.

Our group was treated nicely by the hostesses (despite our trickling in) and bartenders, and our waitress was super attentive and patient, given that we were a group of people who hadn't met each other before, and we spent a lovely long time chatting before we were finally ready to order.\\n\\nAmbiance:  We were on the second floor, within view of the coveted outdoor deck seating (it was rainy, so we didn't really want to be out there, anyway).

It's amazing out loud it gets up there, even when there aren't a whole lot of people around.\\n\\nFood: The risotto was criminally sad.  Risotto should be creamy, velvety, soft, and lovely.  This risotto felt starchy and half hard, like it had been \\nmade yesterday and reheated in the microwave without any liquid added.  The only saving grace were the delicious mushrooms, which tasted like they had been seasoned and sauteed before being added.  The pork chop that came with was cooked to perfection, but really fatty, which I couldn't really see under the sea of too much bbq sauce (tasty, but too much) and the really, really low lighting.  I paid $18 for that? Srsly?  My original plan was to order the portabello salad, but for the price compared to what you get, I'm glad I didn't.\\n\\nConclusions: I was a little wary of going here after reading the reviews, but the plan for the group to meet there was made by someone else long before I was invited, so I figured if nothing else, I'd have lovely company (and I had *awesome* company).  I think if I had to meet a group there again, I'd be sure to grab a large snack beforehand, and stick to the appetizer menu, since it's super pricey for what they offer.

During peak periods you get one of those handheld vibrating gizmos to let you know when seating is available. In the interim, you wait outside in a very pleasant outdoor area (often with live music). Ironically, the problems start when the gizmoo goes off. Instead of being seated, more often than not you end up waiting at the front of the dining area. At this point, you get the distinct sense that no one is steering the boat - a bit of a free-for-all with lots of people standing around. For a place as well-established as Salt Lick, I really can't see an excuse for the bottleneck. \\n\\n2) The sides: The potato salad appears to be an attempt at German-style, but basically looks and tastes like someone knocked a potato around.

They don't skimp on the fish either ;) \\n\\nMy first impression when I walked in was that I wasn't at the right place - given the hh specials. The wait staff is dressed in traditional Japanese attire and you really feel like you're in an authentic Japanese restaurant. Even though we only tried the hh special, everything was delicious and fresh! You can totally walk out of there with a full meal under $15 - always a great thing in my book for good sushi :)\\n\\nNote - try to order everything before 6:30 because the computer switches over from the hh special!"},{"name":"Northwest Liquid Gold","address":"11202 NE Fourth Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great taplist, friendly people, good bottle selection, close to home.

So one day, I asked for chili and they brought me the vinegar & chili, I mixed up a dipping sauce on a plate with the soy sauce on the table, and voila, tasty results.\\n\\nI saw a lot of folks eating the noodle bowls too, so I tried that out.

The restaurant is located in Old City Hall in a location that was a French restaurant for years.  There is a lot of wood and the main dining room has high ceilings and tall windows.  Even the basement seating areas are very nice; one of the rooms is an old vault.\\n\\nService has been top notch on all but one of my visits.  On several visits we have been served by a server named Iouna (not 100% positive of the spelling.  She clearly seems happy to have you there and does her best to anticipate your needs.  She is not pushy but is always available.  If you are in the mood of a night to eat and leave she can accommodate with prompt service.  If you are more in the mood to linger and talk she can accommodate as well.\\n\\nThe starters at Ruth's are decent but not usually the highlight.  You cannot go wrong with the Shrimp Cocktail, Caesar Salad or BBQ Shrimp.\\n\\nThe steaks are perfectly done and come out sizzling due to the heat of the plates coupled with the butter they drizzle on the plate when they place the steak on it.  I have had an upset stomach later due to the butter and usually request no butter but find that I still enjoy it.\\n\\nAt one point they had a Bone-in Sirloin that was large and full of flavor however that was a special and I have not seen it in a while.  I usually go for either s trip or a filet and enjoy either.  A colleague loves the Cowboy Rib eye (a bone-in Rib eye) but I am just not a fan of Rib eye so I usually don't get it.\\n\\nI hate the sides.  Not because they are not good, but because they are out of this world and I need to choose between them.  The sweet potato casserole is sweet and has a crunchy topping and could double for a desert.  The hand cut fries are perfectly fried and the creamed spinach has an outstanding flavor.\\n\\nFor desert, if I have room, I enjoy the Cr√®me Brule.\\n\\nRuth's is not inexpensive (although some of their $39.95 - 3 course specials are a bargain) but, when you walk out of Ruth's you will have enjoyed the meal."},{"name":"House Special","address":"1269 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Having walked by several times, thought I should try their pho sometime..\\nOrdered on Uber Eats the House Special pho a week ago so I can't share about the service or atmosphere but will make some comments on the food.\\n\\nThe pho is reasonably good.

Make sure you get here early if you want to guarantee you have a seat when they first open. My friend and I got here 15 minutes before they opened on a Friday and there was already a short line. Otherwise, you should wait until 12:30pm or so to avoid the initial rush, but it can be difficult to find seating. Most of the seating is communal style with large tables and benches, so you'll likely end up sitting next to strangers.  \\n\\nThere is only one size of pizza available, but different options for the toppings. You can also order calzones and they have cannolis or sfogliatelle for dessert options. We opted to try the highly recommended San Gennaro (Salsiccia, Sweet Red Pepper, Bufala, Cipolline, $22, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Z4z_o0WpVEmWY2UORKsIeQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg), which was delicious!! The crust was SO good, with a crispy exterior but soft and chewy interior. It was airy and fluffy, and didn't sink to the bottom of your stomach like a leaden weight after eating it. The topping combination was also perfect, and the tomato sauce nicely flavorful. We were able to finish this pizza as two girls, since it was difficult to stop eating although we were definitely full at the end. We also loved the Sides for the pizza: Parmesan Cheese, Marinated Peppers, Red Pepper Flakes, Chili Paste (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zVapoDHnwAnUOpKq82Lyvg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg), especially the marinated peppers and red pepper flakes. \\n\\nI would definitely come back here for more pizza if I'm back in the Atlanta area- I can see why they've been profiled for Food Network!!

If I'm not mistaken, you can catch every NFL game here on Sundays, and I imagine a good amount of college games on Saturdays. They have tables, booths, a long bar, and even some comfy faux leather couches with coffee tables if you just want to chill out. I laid back with a Widmer Hefe (my new favorite brew), ate a pretty good turkey sandwich, and enjoyed a little free Wifi while I was at it.

I couldn't pin point what the exact taste was. Confused whether to call it straight coffee or to call it hot chocolate. It was really rich and milky. Awesome start to my day!! \\n\\nI was torn between the Paella and Friscasee. In my mind I was already decided on the Paella but not sure why last minute I chose the Friscasee. Would definitely NOT say it was a regret, as it was a great dish but I wish I would have picked the Paella instead. This is not Chambars fault but I despise dried fruits and did not realize there would be raisins or some sort of dried fruit in here... I suppose it contributes to the flavour but I felt it was a waste to the dish as I had to weave through everything to avoid them :( The sauce the beef was braised in was very salty. Great with the potatoes and the foccacia but it made it difficult to eat whilst focusing on my conversation with my friend. The beef literally melts on your tongue and was VERY tender. I just think the sauce tasted too much like I was eating at a backyard bbq. \\n\\nI didn't drive here but I would assume parking here may be difficult to find but luckily it is close to vcc and presumably near a skytrain station. There is a huge patio area and a great restaurant to bring a date. Patio patrons beware of no umbrellas outside so you're left mingling in the sun for the duration of your meal. Servers are very tentative and check up enough to make sure you're comfortable but never intrusive.

They just stared at us as if we were aliens. We received confirmation that the restaurant was open. Fleeing from their unwanted gazes we headed up the stairs hoping to be seated. Upon entering the top floor into the greenhouse dining room, being welcomed by yet again confused stares from 3 waitresses (?). At this point we as customers were now very confused as to why we have yet to be spoken to or seated after 2 minutes of  wandering around this restaurant!? When the staring contest was finally broken by one of the waitresses with the prize winning inquiry - \\"Wasn't there someone to seat you?\\". Now personal injection here- ah doesn't matter if that is someone else's job, when you have customers that obviously did not get stopped by anyone downstairs to be seated that is probably not the best way to greet a customer.\\n\\n5 minutes of our lives wasted. We were seated! Whoo hoo right? \\n\\nNEGATORY!!\\n\\nPrepared to not let the first impressions define our experience, we sat down in a cozy corner. Unfortunately they continued their roll of inexcusable service in an EMPTY RESTAURANT.  We then wasted another 10 minutes sitting here waiting for a waitress (there were 3?!). All of us were on a timeline,  so we decided to flag down a waitress. The first verbal \\"Excuse me\\" was fallen on deaf ears. The second \\"Excuse me\\" was ignored. Oh did I mention the restaurant  was EMPTY? Finally, one of us got up     and walked over to the 3 waitresses (2 were seated and 1 was actually busy) to request service. Mind you that is the first time I had to ever physically wander over to waitress to request for service. What was the kicker was that too was ignored! Another personal insert- I think it's pretty hard to ignore a physical human there, but these 3 waitresses... \\n\\nSo 20 minutes we ended up with a belly of water and made a unanimous decision to leave. I have never left a restaurant with such disdain.  No one even tried to stop us, not apologize for the lack of service.\\n\\nIf there was an option to rate a 0 on yelp - today's experience would have been the definition to use."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"We have visited the Salt Lick many times in the last decade....excellent.

The food was good but service was slow,  not on point,  and our waiter was completely disengaged.  I don't expect to be treated like I'm at a four-star  but the waiter should at least act like he cares that we're happy.  He would rush and run constantly while attending all if his time at the table next to us.  We got the appetizer with the spicy capicola, prosciutto,  and cheese with some candied walnuts (which I think are just the bourbon-candied pecans from the Whole Foods nearby), but there were only three small thin pieces of crostini (about 1\\"x3\\") to go with the meats (several thin slices of capicola and several of prosciutto),  and they didn't bring our bread until after we asked after our appetizer finally arrived (an appetizer that requires no effort but grabbing stuff and putting it on a wood block). The bread had three small slices and I joked with my spouse that of all if the things to skimp on bread and crostini are poor choices because they're the cheapest thing there!   The place has lost its charm for us,  even though the food is good.  It's not worth $33 for a filet. We didn't bother to get dessert because we were tired of being disappointed by our waiter.  We wanted to know what kind of pinot (what year,  etc.)  because he took the menus before taking our order by stopping, taking our menus as if taking our order (although that's weird because sometimes people need to see the menu to point their choice out),  and then rushing to the table next to us and completely ignoring us. It felt like he was taking our menus away for taking too long to choose. When I said I'd love to know more information about the wine,  (and he dropped our ticket off so quickly without giving us a chance to stop him - the way he was the entire time),  he commented that he's just a guy who moves fast. He didn't say anything like \\"What can I help you with\\" but was just really cold. \\nI am not extremely picky, and I dislike prima donna reviews that aren't objective, but I expect service to support this price point, and I get better service at Waffle House on a sleepy Sunday morning when I don't want to go anywhere.  Another weird thing happened when he was talking once again forever to the people behind us.  They asked what \\"Cibo e Beve\\" means and he answered \\"food and dance\\" which made me chuckle, because anyone remotely familiar with Italian knows that \\"Beve\\" shares the same root as the word \\"beverage.\\"  We acted like decent people and still gave a decent tip (20%) but he could have gotten much better.  Two entrees,  a skimpy appetizer plate, and one glass of wine later we were over $90 before including the tip. We paid for a pleasant experience, and got a waiter that belongs at Golden Corral.  He was tall,  dark,  with short cropped hair and glasses.  Oh,  and he told the table behind us that he's been there for five years,  but when I asked for a favorite I got just a couple of years ago he says he didn't remember them every second it although at the time it was extremely popular for several months.\\nI'm very disappointed that a place we used to love has slipped and is now pretentious.\\nThere are very limited parking spaces in front, so it's better to park in back if you feel safe behind the building.  There's still not enough parking during a busy time, and the spaces in front of the restaurant are very narrow as if made only for compact cars and not SUVs."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Wine was good but expensive.

Chef Chris Yeo has partnered with Ludacris to bring his popular SF-based Malaysian concept to Midtown in the space previously occupied by Spice, and at first it may seem like an off pairing. I mean, Yeo has been wowing Bay Area foodies for years with his take on Singaporean cuisine, and Luda (yes, we are that tight, he calls me Steak) gets people grooving to \\"Move Get Out the Way\\" (at least, that's what I think the song is called- my only exposure to it was that they used to play it at Falcons games when TJ Duckett plowed through the line.) I'll give them both credit, though. Ludacris partnered with a seasoned chef that brings something different to the Atlanta market, and Yeo partnered with someone who will bring in the customers. I was sort of hoping that one of them would be in the restaurant that night, but Yeo had just left town, and if Luda shows up, supposedly it's usually after midnight. But heck, I was there, so I am sure that made someone's night.\\n\\nWhen I first walked in at 7pm, the place was mostly empty. Sitting at the bar sipping on a Kirin, Tears for Fears was playing (somewhat loudly) over the sound system, and I was thinking to myself \\"Would Luda approve of this?\\" It was a nice tune, however, reminding me of my days as the \\"guy on the scene\\" in 1985 (I was that hip, even at 17!). The bartender was quick to tell me that not only would it pick up, but the kitchen would likely be open until 2am that night. Why, I asked. \\"Because it's Tuesday.\\" (Of course, silly question). There are also upscale private rooms both upstairs and downstairs for those looking to take their groove to a higher level. One day.\\n\\nAs the night went on, the place filled up, the music got louder, and let's just say, more contemporary. So on to the food. The menu is filled with many small plates and you are encouraged to share everything. Even the entr√©e's are quite small, so the two of us easily devoured two appetizers and two entrees. Their signature appetizer is the Kung Pao Lollipops, and these rock. They are chicken wing drums (prepared more like a \\"General Tso\\" style, than Kung Pao- but Kung Pao sounds better), covered with minced peanuts and jalapenos. I could have eaten 10 of these (you only get 4 per plate).\\n\\nFor the main course, we had the Tamarind Beef and the Origami Sea bass. The Tamarind Beef was served with a delicious black pepper oyster sauce. Unfortunately, the beef was slightly overcooked and not very tender for a filet. Also, this was one of the rare dishes that suffered from not enough sauce. I found myself using the beef to mop up any residual sauce on the bottom of the plate. The Sea bass was outstanding. It was cooked and served in something like a parchment covered box which kept the fish hot and moist. Flavor exploded from each bite. And given that there were quite a few mushrooms (Steakhead's big food aversion), I still cobbled up my share.\\n\\nAs I look at Straits, I could definitely see myself going back for drinks and grazing on the small plates. There were so many that caught my eye (like the Crispy Wontons, Sambal Udang, and Straits Spareribs to name a few).

What a find! Located on a narrow street with old style buildings in the North Side it has a great vibe. Sitting down was a bit tough in the restaurant as I'm tall and it was a bit of a squeeze. But it was worth it. As soon as we ordered wine from their great selection I forgot all about the tight seating. I had trouble deciding between a couple of the menu items but the server recommended the chicken and boy am I glad I went with his recommendation.

Yes, it's small and the line can be long (but it tends to move), but the service isn't breathing down your neck trying to rush you either. I usually can't pass up the calamari appetizer--the breading is light and crispy, the squid is never rubbery, and the peppers are a good balance of spicy with a hint of sweet.\\n\\nFor entrees, I have had better luck with the prepared plates. You *can* design your own dish--choose a pasta, choose a protein, choose a sauce--but I've found that you can mess this up and get something merely good where you could have had a meal that you find yourself daydreaming about a few months later. For me, those memorable dishes include the fusilli with lobster, the peas/prosciutto combo, and the butternut squash ravioli. One prepared dish that I don't like: the filling in the lobster ravioli is too fine for my taste--I prefer lobster pieces, which are available (and great) on other dishes.\\n\\nBut the good food here is so good that I can't bring myself to give it anything other than five stars."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best cuban in Portland.

Orlando doesn't really have any true French bistros, with the possible exception of  Chefs de France at Epcot, which isn't exactly convenient--or cheap.\\n\\nI had some doubts when we arrived at Jean Pierre's for dinner, because the place was deserted, and quite brightly lit, more like what you'd expect from a bakery or a sandwich shop--both of which it is, during the daytime. So it wasn't exactly the ambiance I was hoping for from an evening bistro. But the food was everything I'd hoped for.\\n\\nWe started with the house made pat√©, a cheese plate, smoked salmon, and a salad with traditional French vinaigrette. All were excellent, especially the pate (really a terrine), which was fresh, flavorful, and had a wonderful mixture of spices on the outside. We could have used some soft, stinky cheeses, but I understand why American tastes run to firmer, less fragrant ones, and the half dozen choices were all very flavorful. The salmon was fresh and very smokey, with just the right accompaniments, and the salad was perfect, just like in Paris.\\n\\nOur main courses were Beef Bourguignon and Chicken in a mushroom and madeira sauce. Both sauces were excellent, and each was accompanied by a rich, creamy dish of scalloped potatoes. A particular highlight was the fresh baked French baguette, which was plentiful and very authentic. As parting gifts the owner bestowed upon us glasses of Muscat and a fresh loaf of this wonderful bread to take with us.\\n\\nI was impressed that the owner, with little assistance, could turn out such a diverse offering in so little time; and there were at least twenty other dishes we could have chosen. Prices are very reasonable, and the wine list has a couple of nice choices at good prices. It's too bad his location isn't higher profile, and that his website is fairly poor, because this is just the sort of French bistro Orlando needs."},{"name":"Pinocchio Village Haus","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Like most cafeteria style options inside Disney, this is just another place to grab a bite to eat in order to satisfy your hunger and keep conquering attractions you paid so much to see.\\n\\nThe Pinocchio Village Haus has a variety of sub sandwiches and a few flatbread pizza options.

Here is what we ordered:\\n\\nKorean-style Scallion Pancake\\nTwo orders of BBQ Combo 1. This combo consists of kalbi, bulgolgi, pork bulgogi, chicken bulgolgi, with mushroom and vegetable. \\n\\nThe scallion pancake was pretty tasty. Not crispy, but warm and chewy. The sauce was also decent and made the pancake slightly tastier. We got some Korean style banchan. I thought the kimchi and various pickled vegetables were decently good. I also liked the tofu as well.\\n\\nAs for the BBQ combo, they serve it by pouring the raw marinated meats and vegetables onto an electric burner that is on your table. I thought some of the meats were okay and some of the meats were tasty. I did like the pork bulgolgi and the kalbi the most. I really liked the barbecue flavor and the meat was fairly tender and chewy. The beef was a little rough and tasted slightly bland but the dipping sauce made it tastier. I also liked the lettuce, thought it was fairly crisp and fresh. Chicken was a little dry, but I guess it was because we left it on the burners for a while. Vegetables were also decently good despite some of them being slightly burned. Rice was also good, they serve it fairly small bowls. \\n\\nOrdering two BBQ combos for two people is definitely more than enough to get four people's stomachs full. However, the price might be a little steep, about $42 for one combo. As for service, I thought the staff was fairly nice. Interior looked more like a Japanese restaurant, but this is supposedly a fusion Japanese/Korean restaurant and also serves Japanese dishes such as sushi and katsu. \\n\\nOverall, this is a pretty good choice to splurge and pig out on some decent Korean barbecue and I would not mind coming back here again as long as I have a wallet filled with cash."},{"name":"Jollyville Bar & Grill","address":"11835 Jollyville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Ahhh... too many negative things to say.... I don't want to be Miss Negativity but I feel so strongly about my dining experience this morning I couldn't even wait to write about it.  So here we go: \\n- Firstly, who ARE you?  Austin Diner or Jollyville Bar & Grill or Tex Mex Bar & Grill or whatever the sign outside says that does not match the menu in front of us or the website we saw online with the same exact address???  Apparently they parted ways with Austin Diner two weeks ago, but have yet to update anything and will not honor the 10% off coupon found online at the Austin Diner AND the Jollyville Bar & Grill website.  HUH??  Already off to a bad start with your identity crisis.  \\n- Morning drink specials:  $5 bloody mary's, $2.50 mimosas, plus a complimentary mimosa with breakfast.  (The comp mimosa was OJ with maybe a splash of champagne, but it was free so I'm not going to say anything else about that.)\\n- Breakfast menu looked promising with big portions and average prices.  My friend ordered the Big time: 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 1 sausage patty, home fries and 2 light wheat pancakes for 8.49 and I ordered the Homestyle Breakfast: 2 eggs, 2 sausage patties, with 2 open-faced biscuits covered with homemade gravy, served with home fries for 7.99.  We both subbed hash browns for home fries.  When my food came out, the eggs and sausage were covered in gravy on top of the biscuits.  All of it.  Gravy-covered eggs, ew.  They were salvageable but let's just say the most enjoyable part of my breakfast was the hash browns.  I tried my friend's pancakes and they were pretty good but needed butter (none came with them and we didn't feel like asking for any).  \\n- It looked like our waitress only had about 3 tables, and the service was SO SLOW.  It took FOREVER to get our tickets and pay.  I don't even want to name names but she is either inexperienced, new or just not good at her job.  We weren't even demanding, and were very patient.  I even stirred my coffee with my knife so I wouldn't have to wait on her to get me something else that should have already been brought (such as sweeteners and condiments).  \\n- There was another table at the bar with a couple who was seated after us and when their food came out, we heard multiple apologies and then the couple got up and left without eating their food.  That can't be good.  After a while, I watched the bartender take both plates back to the kitchen (wouldn't let the busser take the plates), I'm sure to show them something that was wrong with them.  I don't even want to know what, especially since I finished my food.   \\n- When we paid our tabs, my friend's total was 9.19.  She paid with a $20 bill and was given $10 back, and shorted the .81, which is more than enough to just ignore.  Well crap, 20% on 9.19 is 1.83, so that would have been half of your tip, but where did it go?  \\n\\nI wish I had something nicer to say, so the 1 star is for a good playlist (I was happy hearing Otis Redding and Ryan Adams during my breakfast) and good hash browns.

When we arrived we received another version, so I'll lay it all out here. \\n\\nHH specials from 4-7pm: bar and bar top tables only: $1 off premium margaritas.\\n\\nAfter 7PM, Taco Tuesday special in the bar: $5 house margs, $15 house marg pitchers and $3 mexican beers. \\n\\nAfter 7PM Taco Tuesday: All you can eat tacos for $14.99 in restaurant or bar. \\n\\nAlrighty, now that we have that straight, we enjoyed a nice early night at the bar but I wish we had arrived *after* 7pm to get the better drink specials. Christian, the bartender, took great care of us and we enjoyed our time. We started out with the chips and salsa, which were great. The housemade chips were not greasy and spiced nicely and the salsa while not spicy, was very fresh and flavorful. The house margaritas were a good balance of juice and tequila, somewhat strong and worth a taste.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the Chile Rellenos, the Cobb Salad and the California Fish Tacos. My friend and I split the Chile Rellenos and California Fish Tacos, so I can attest to their yumminess. The only thing that could be changed, was the Chiles being cooked a bit longer. The shredded cheese in the creamy filling wasn't quite melted in several areas on my pepper, but it was a tasty dish. The California Fish Tacos are made with a nice portion of Mahi that can be fried, grilled or blackened and served on either corn or flour soft tortillas. We tried the order of 3 tacos with a mix of grilled and blackened. When sampling the fish on it's own- the blacked easily won for favorite. Tasty, flaky and cooked perfectly. When sampling the fish in the tacos, when you add all of the other flavors, surprisingly there wasn't a decernable difference between the blackened and the grilled mahi. Both were great. The black beans on the side are veggie friendly and very tasty. \\n\\nOur other friend was very happy with her Cobb, it's was chocked full of fresh ingredients and enough for my friend to enjoy dinner and save 1/2 for lunch. A nice option- they do offer this salad in a 1/2 portion if leftovers aren't your thing.\\n\\nThe decor is eclectic and funky, large chandeliers are sprinkled throughout the restaurant and dominate the bar area.

It was a beautiful day out, so I asked for a table out on the lakefront patio and was told the wait would be about ten minutes. We were quickly sat, given menus and our server made a quick appearance to greet us and tell us that he'd be right back with some water for us. So far, so good.\\n\\nAfter asking our server for drink recommendations, I picked the \\"Partida Rita\\" off the margarita list on the beverage menu. Made with Partida Blanco tequila, agave nectar, and fresh squeezed lime juice, it tasted both sweet and tart. The subtle tequila taste made it easy to drink and refreshing.\\n\\nWhile placing the drink order, we killed two birds with one stone and went ahead and ordered our appetizers as well. As a cheese lover, I went the \\"Queso Fundido with Carne Molida\\" route, chihuahua and cheddar cheeses, sliced chile, and ground beef baked in a cast iron skillet served with flour tortillas. The appetizer came slowly after the drinks and we dove right in since we were starving. This appetizer is good for sharing, but I don't necessarily recommend it to those hoping for a cheese fondue. It was overwhelmingly spicy since it was mostly ground beef and chile peppers with a layer of cheese on top. The ground beef was well seasoned, but I wish it had more cheese and less meat for my taste. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable and sharable starter. My friends decided to order the \\"Guacamole made Tableside\\" and it was awesome to say the least. You can choose between mild, medium, or hot which makes it a great customizable appetizer that can be personalized to cater to anyone who enjoys a good guacamole. They brought over a cart with all the guacamole fixings and prepared the guacamole right in front of us. This was a great dinner and a show option, and we liked the fact that we could see them make it right before our eyes. They set it down on the middle of the table and we went for it. It was creamy, but still chunky with the slightest taste of cilantro. Since it was made to order, it tasted both fresh and delicious. I would say that both of our starters were perfect options for those looking to share.\\n\\nI went with the \\"Mole Poblano Enchiladas\\" as my entr√©e of choice. Two corn tortillas rolled in sauce, baked with chihuahua cheese and served with refried beans and yellow rice sounded like absolute heaven. I had my entr√©e forced onto me while I was still halfway through my appetizer, so I sent my food back to the kitchen to keep warm while I finished my queso fundido. With every bite I took from the enchiladas, it brought me back to the day I tried mole for the first time. It was slightly bland, but still good in taste. The portion was pretty good for the price and everything on the plate made the entire dish well balanced. The creaminess from the refried beans paired well with the crunchiness from the enchiladas' hard corn tortilla shells. The yellow rice was probably my least favorite since it tasted nothing like traditional Mexican rice and was overpowering in taste, but the slow roasted chicken in mole sauce was still hitting the spot.\\n\\nFor our dessert choice, we opted for a traditional Mexican favorite, \\"Tres Leches Cake\\". This decadent dessert course was delightfully sweet and the fresh cut strawberries and bananas served with it added a touch of freshness that was necessary. Unlike traditional tres leches which is iced with whipped cream, Rocco's Tacos puts its own twist on this dessert by topping it off with meringue that is lightly toasted until golden brown. It was fluffy and airy which was a pleasant change since the tres leches was already so rich and had me begging for a glass of water (in a good way).\\n\\nI've visited Rocco's Tacos a couple of times before and had enjoyed myself on both occasions. This time around, the food was good and definitely worth praising up to a certain extent, but the service was dreadful. Our server Jay Jay was the furthest thing from personable and attentive. To start, my margarita was served in a chipped glass, and he barely stopped by the table and when he did, it wasn't long enough for us to express any concerns. He paid more attention to larger parties and intentionally didn't care for us since we were probably his table with the youngest guests. Little did he know that we work in the restaurant industry and had full intentions to tip him well. We would've understood if he was busy and, in the weeds, but that wasn't the case on this Thursday afterrnoon. He let our empty, dirty entr√©e plates sit on the table for fifteen minutes while he took care of his other parties, knowing that we were done. At that point, I called over Hanna, one of the managers on duty to explain my frustrations.

Yes, pretty river, gorgeous houses, scenic limestone. What's that you say, rumbly stomach? When in Texas, where my barbecue at? Yes indeed.\\n\\nEnough of the sightseeing, I firmly told my cousin. I wanted meat, and lots of it. So he took us out to the boonies (his words)- a nice drive through rolling hills, past the Hindu temple (we mentally apologized in advance for the amount of red meat we were about to consume), and into the dusty parking lot. Saturday 3PM arrival meant about a 15-minute wait, but we spent the time enjoying the universe's best freshly squeezed lemonade and reading the Salt Lick's history/cookery text.\\n\\nMy cousin handled the food order (also, the bill, so I'm not sure about the $$). When we realized later that we ate 4 kinds of meat, 3 kinds of sides, and 2 kinds of dessert, we felt a little embarrassed. But not really. The food is that damn good.\\n\\nFor real, not-imaginary-foofery health reasons, I can't eat red meat, but my husband and my cousin did sure seem to appreciate the ribs and the brisket.

That is, of course, unless you live near by the Salt Lick, in which case you are lucky enough to enjoy the tender and smoky turkey on a regular basis.\\n\\nBut you should still probably order the chicken. Or, per husband, brisket.\\n\\nBaked beans were aite. Potato salad was tasty. Cole slaw was quite nice- tangy and refreshing, not cloying with sauce. Even the pickles were great- none of that interesting something-something you get from a jar.\\n\\nDessert was the half peach/half blackberry cobbler, which we all found too sweet, but I gluttonously finished anyway. Well, I was determined to go all out on my first ever experience with a full Texas bbq meal, down to the last drop of vanilla ice cream.\\n\\nLovely memory. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Austin.\\n\\nLanded in SF today, and my boss asked how the weekend went. I told him I had barbecue at the Salt Lick, and he smiled knowingly.

They fried up the bacon, peppers, and onions right there while we waited, but the scrambled eggs were already made...which I guess is ok...actually the jury is still out on pre-made scrambled eggs....when were they made?  I wanna know.  Anyway I wanted salsa but they aren't serving it because of the salmonella outbreak (I thought that was over with...?) so they gave me some ancho chipotle on the side.  It was really good and had a little kick that reminded me of Texas.  It was a little smaller than the sandwich pita I had last time, and I struggled to finish the last few bites I was sooo full.  Plus I just now had a little snack (chips and salsa...haha) and it has been 7 hours since the pita!  Usually I eat every 3 or 4 hrs so that's a big, filling meal.  Oh and they serve breakfast all day.\\n\\nEarlier this week I had the gyro but didn't listen to the yelper below and get double meat - next time I will.  It still made for lunch AND dinner.

Since it was Restaurant Week, we were able to make a reservation for a Thursday night at 9:30 pm, but the Chef's Whim is usually only on Sundays, I think. It was REALLY late for us to be eating dinner, but our schedule was bonkers anyways, since we were jetlagged a bit from traveling.\\n\\nWe arrived a little early and were seated right away. However, the service was a bit spotty as throughout the evening we found our eyes rolling about the restaurant trying to locate our server and waiting for what would come next. We went with the 6-course menu, but in hindsight, we were so stuffed by the time we hit the 5th course with some courses being rather mediocre that I don't think it's a huge step up to go 6 over 4. For moderate eaters like me, I would just go with the 4-course menu so you can thoroughly savor and enjoy each course and not be SUPER stuffed by the end of the night.\\n\\nDefinitely appreciated how they were trying to tailor their courses to their diners... newbies seemed to be getting the specials while repeat customers looked to be getting some other dishes, but it actually made me a little sad thinking that maybe we weren't getting special treatment and might be missing out on something stellar someone else received. I appreciate the concept of a slow meaningful meal, but there were points at which we were waiting 30-40 minutes between finishing the last bite of one course and starting the next one. It made the flow of our dinner a bit choppy, since we wavered between excitement at seeing what would come next and grumpiness that we were having to wait for so long to see what it would be.\\n\\nThat said, there were a few highlights among the variety of food we enjoyed.\\nGOOD:\\nAmuse bouche - poached & chilled Maine mussel over funnel cream (something light and savory to get the meal going)\\n1st - sashimi kona kampachi on sesame seeds/citrus coulis with mustard seeds\\n2nd [BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT!] - slow-roased monkfish with curred spinach, split pea puree and crab & maine shrimp - some of the freshest and impeccably well-cooked seafood I ever had... the firm texture and surprisingly harmonious flavors were perfection itself. It was all downhill from that apex of fine dining.\\nMEH (everything else):\\n3rd - asparagus over golden raisins with a poached egg\\n4th - chicken. It wasn't that memorable.\\n5th - Meyer lemon sorbet with candied Meyer lemon peel\\n6th - Dessert (Orange blossom beignet with orange marmalade & creme anglais / Spearmint affogato)\\n\\nMaybe it was the late hour. Maybe it was the packed house. The 2nd course was the absolute star, so it was disappointing for the rest of the meal to not live up to that early highlight. I wouldn't give the main dining room another try, BUT I'm very intrigued by all the hype about the burger at the bar. It was highly recommended by our server."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Great food.

We had the sampler platter that had 6 mini fried sausages, 3 fried scallops, some ribs and some chicken wings. It was delicious, except for the fried scallops.

I think I would have been fine with just that, but I ordered the gnocchi sea, gnocci do for an entree. BF had the fish and chips. So I had two more scallops on my gnocci dish, along with crispy pork belly pieces and pillowy potato gnoochi! Delicious. As if that wasn't already enough, we had to try the bread pudding since it was such a popular dessert offering amongst fellow yelpers. It was pretty ridiculous. Our waite,r Logan, was already really surprised that we were going to get dessert! We did not regret it, and tried our best to polish it off but we only made it about a 1/4 of the way through (the best part is the top anyway).

This place is run by a bunch of discriminatory, rude individuals who have no idea how to run a professional business and are comfortable humiliating clients in front of other patrons. \\n\\nI stumbled upon this bar with my sisters and our significant others when celebrating my graduation. We were all in the back room keeping to ourselves, being quiet and respectful, and genuinely trying to have a good time when the manager on duty, Lizzie, took it upon herself to be incredibly rude to my boyfriend. She claimed he was drinking behind her back after they declined his ID for no reason other than it was Mexican and they couldn't tell it was real since they didn't have a scanner. Because he is a nice guy, he apologized although he had done absolutely nothing wrong. She continued to yell at him in front of other patrons and then threatened to kick him out of the bar. When my sister and I asked for an apology for this unfair treatment we were attacked by both Lizzie and the blonde bartender. Even though the bartender was the only one on duty, she left her customers to create drama, and the manager took us to the most public part of the restaurant to discuss this so everyone could witness this event (incredibly professional, right?). It was completely unnecessary, not at all what should be done, and uncalled for. \\n\\nA simple apology, that's all we asked for. Yet they refused, most likely because my boyfriend is Mexican, because he clearly looks over 21, we were all in our late twenties and early thirties, and based on the other reviews of this bar having racist and discriminatory vibes, I have reason to believe that isn't the first time they have pulled a stunt like this. \\n\\nWe contacted the general manager after this horrible experience and apart from not apologizing for his employees' clear discrimination, he also didn't even apologize for his employees' behavior, acknowledge that they shouldn't have brought the drama to disrupt the other clients, or even that the bartender was wrong to give me the middle finger and talk about us to the other people at the bar. The GM only refunded the money for our drinks after profusely trying to get across how completely unacceptable this behavior is. Long story short, if they had to refuse my boyfriends ID because they couldn't tell if it was real, they should have said upfront that he couldn't be in the bar because if they claim he could be a minor (even though he is 6'2\\", has a full on beard, was dressed professionally and in no way looked underage) then they would have been harboring a minor in a bar when they weren't even serving food and there was no reason he would be there other than to drink. No wonder the bar was almost completely empty on the weekend. Avoid this place at all costs. \\n\\nIf you think this review doesn't reflect any reasons why you should avoid it, here are a few more:\\n1. There wasn't even music playing. \\n2. This place was dead apart from what appeared to be a couple of regulars at the bar\\n3. The cocktails were definitely below average\\n4. The staff clearly did not care about looking professional. Both had their hair in a messy bun, had oversized T-shirts on, and no makeup \\n5. The patio wasn't even open on a summer day to play the \\"lawn games\\" and \\"giant jenga\\" that are advertised online nor is there a live DJ.\\n6. The service was slow (probably because they had to pick a fight with other customers)\\n7. There are plenty of bars even just in union square that won't treat you terribly and are just generally better in every way.

I'll be honest, I've been here a couple times before and each time, the customer service was always very brash to say the least. However, this time it was taken to a whole other level.\\n\\nFirst, the restaurant is cash only, doesn't take reservations, and takes customers via the first-come, first-serve line outside the restaurant - or at least it is supposed to.\\n\\nWe showed up at around 5:30 on a weekday so the line wasn't too long. There were a couple of 4-person parties ahead of us and we had a party of 2 (Honestly, the food is average for the North End and totally not worth the wait but my wife enjoys one of the dishes so I didn't mind going back).\\n\\nThere's an older woman from the restaurant who takes down the numbers in each party and manages the line, letting you know when your table is ready. My wife told her we had two people. After about 15 minutes, the old lady comes back out and asks me how many people. I hold up 2 fingers. She proceeds to ask the couple in line behind us how many people. They say 2 and she quickly says \\"Come with me,\\" completely skipping us in line. Puzzling right?\\n\\nWhen she comes back out, I tell her \\"We have two people as well.\\" She answers \\"I know.\\" So for a restaurant that takes no reservations, there really is no reason to skip a party of 2 to sit another party of 2 that is farther back in the line. We tried not to make a big deal about it but when we finally got a table about 15 minutes later, we ask the old lady why she skipped us. Her response, \\"There's no reason. I'm sorry.\\" But by the tone of her voice, she wasn't sorry. She simply could care less. \\n\\nRegarding the food, we live in the area and eat in the North End often. I will honestly tell you there are MANY RESTAURANTS EVEN ON HANOVER THAT HAVE LESS OF A WAIT, BETTER FOOD, AND MUCH BETTER SERVICE.

In fact, the orders were combined so the food would come out at the same time but the payments were broken up. Brilliant!\\n\\nI chose the Potato side and the Pistachio Toast. The potatoes were cooked well but weren't what I expected. They were diced instead of large chunks. Still good.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Matija Breads. I took a focaccia class with the owner and the bread I had that night can only be described as life-changing. The pistachio toast did not disappoint. The bread was chewy but not hard.

We ended up getting three orders of everything because they had no idea what they were doing, and then they charged us for all of it! They charged us for 3 chocolate cakes that nobody ordered, and a coffee that they told us they didn't even have. When we tried to get our bill adjusted the manager was being extremely rude and aggressive and then added a $150 tip to our bill, even though we only saw our waitress about three times in the 2 and a half hours we were there.

Also love the BYOB\\n\\nThe Cuisine:  The San Genero is a favorite.  Perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Fresh basil, basil and other toppings are available by the handful.  The crust resembles that in Italy in thickness but not in crispiness.  The dough is probably more like that of a quality NY pizza, but the sauce and toppings are far more unique, and can't be found anywhere in Atlanta.\\n\\nThe Venue: European style dining at long tables with other guests.  The majority of the seating is in a large space shared by the actual kitchen with food fire ovens.  I always love when you can see the kitchen and how they make the food.  The lack of plates makes for a fun, picnic style dining.  The ovens make it rather hot, even in the winter.\\n\\nThe Good: Top of the line pizza.  BYOB. Parking is pretty easy for a midtown location.\\n\\nThe Bad:  Often hard to find seating for a large group (5 or more).

Ambiente great, service excellent!!!!!!!"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I took my mom to the Salt Lick for Mother's Day.  She'd never been before (she said she tried to go once in the 70s but the line was too long ... my husband and I went a couple of times 5+ years ago but I didn't get family style at the time).  We made sure to arrive early so that we wouldn't have to wait.  Got there at around 10:45 and were probably the 5th table seated (yes, they seated us 10 minutes or so before the place officially opened).  \\n\\nWe all ordered the \\"family style.\\"  We also decided to try the special Sunday sides (Au Gratin Potatoes and Green Bean Casserole) so we ordered one of each for the table.  \\n\\nOverall, it was much, much better than Snow's, and narrowly missed being a 5-star experience.  Here's a breakdown:\\n\\nGreen bean casserole: better than most of the canned Christmas stuff.  Mild and just the right amount of creaminess.\\n\\nAu gratin potatoes: very cheesy, maybe a bit too Velveeta-like though, potatoes perhaps needed to be a bit more done.\\n\\nPotato salad/Coleslaw: I don't like these so didn't eat them.  My mom and my husband ate them and said they were good back-to-basics type versions of these standards.\\n\\nBeans:  Much better than the beans at most barbecue places.  Not an afterthought at all ... salty and smoky just like we like them.\\n\\nSauce: I'm a fan.  Sweet and smoky, not too peppery or vinegar-y.  Went really well with the brisket. \\n\\nPork Ribs:  Interesting.  I don't usually eat pork ribs (a lot of work for a little payoff), but decided to try these.  They had a hard lacquer-ish coating that was very flavorful (reminded me of Asian-style ribs) and were tender on the inside.  I only ate like 1.5 of them because the second one I tried had more fat and some cartilagelike bits that I didn't enjoy.  But my mom and my husband (who are much more into ribs) had no trouble polishing off several more.  \\n\\nSausage:  We all thought we were brought too much sausage in proportion to the other meats.  Nevertheless, the sausage was quite good.  Not too spicy or greasy, and it tasted great.  Also got a couple of slightly-burnt slices that I really enjoyed.  \\n\\nBrisket: What we all came for, and it mostly didn't disappoint.  Our first two \\"rounds\\" of brisket were perfect: moist/tender, smoky, great bark/smoke ring, etc.  Prettymuch the best thing ever.  We asked for \\"thirds\\" on only that one meat, and what we were brought out was fattier and tougher, perhaps with more connective tissue.  It was still tasty, but not as much as our first two helpings, so we stopped eating at that point since we were getting quite full.\\n\\nEverything else:  Service was pretty good.  Our waiter was attentive and often anticipated our needs.  He also brought us a to-go box at the end of our meal, which is surprising since to-go is supposedly not allowed for family style.  The tea and water were pretty bad:  tea was super-weak and only available in unsweetened, and the water must have had too many minerals in it or something.  Also, I wore a skirt to the restaurant and I guess the bench we sat on made the back of one of my legs all black, which wasn't all that great since we had errands to run post-lunch.  Oh well, I knew it wasn't a fancy place since I'd been before ....\\n\\nI had been worried that the Salt Lick was slipping based on recent reviews, but I think it's still really great!  Definitely not a place I want to go to often (sooo much meat!), but maybe we'll move it up to once-a-year status or something (maybe even twice-a-year) ...."},{"name":"Island Fin Pok√© Company","address":"7004 Tavistock Lakes Blvd, Ste 148","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Went for the first time today and LOVED it.

The hostess was pretty clueless, didn't write any names down, just kept walking around the waiting people asking how many in their party (even though she'd already asked them 3-4 times).

The crust beneath the tomato sauce was thin while the edges of the pie were fat.  The sauce was a bit wet and made for a floppy slice, yet it was sufficiently tasty.\\n\\nService was satisfactory.  Though I was not asked how I liked my lunch as I was consuming it, my water glass was filled and refilled by both the hostess and the bartender while my server was the sole fellow handling the rest of the lunchtime crowd."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Awesome Neapolitan pizza.

Just to clarify this is Texas BBQ (duh!), so it's going to be different from Eastern Carolina, Carolina, Memphis, KC, etc...There's your BBQ 101.\\n\\nI'm guessing one of the huge draws is that you can BYOB, since it's in a dry county.  That was definitely cool, but it's definitely off the beaten path being out in Driftwood...so depending on where you are it can be a good haul.\\n\\nSince we had 4 people, we were advised that buying by the pound would be our most economical way to try a little bit of everything (a tip from the waiter I certainly appreciated).  So, we tried the chicken, brisket, sausage, ribs, and turkey.  We also tried the beans and potato salad.  No cole slaw lovers amongst us.\\n\\nThere really was nothing special about the chicken or turkey, so if you're looking for run of the mill...well you've got it.  As a whole, I really didn't think the brisket was that great either.  It wasn't dry, but it wasn't particularly juicy either.  The potato salad and baked beans were good and I'm glad we got them.\\n\\nThe place has a giant parking lot and a winery adjacent (weird...how do they get around the dry county thing?), but as a whole, I wouldn't suggest you make a special trip to go to this place.

There was no where to park out front and of course I parked next door, but my friend was like you should move you should move and after reading numerous signs about not parking next door... I moved... But not before I put my name on the waiting list cuz this place was PACKED...  \\n\\nAfter I parked across the street and walked back, we finally found a spot to lean up against the wall in the smallest waiting area known to mankind.  I think we waited about 15-20 minutes.  From being packed in the waiting area like sardines, I wasn't quite sure we'd made the best decision of eating there....but we were hungry and quite curious to see what we'd gotten in to.  \\n\\nWhen the host called my name, I went woo hoo and ran over like 3 people to get inside... We were sat in a table closer to the back and started to check out appetizers.  The only vegetarian Thai app I saw was the fried tofu... So I ended up ordering the vegetable egg rolls from the Chinese food section.  My friend ordered the potstickers... (Man who do I have to kill for some vegetarian dumplings)...   It didn't take long to get our apps and they came out hot and delicious.  I only ordered 2 egg rolls but I'm sure I could've eaten 5.  They weren't greasy, the vegetables were still crisp inside the rolls and seasoned well... They were great.  \\n\\nNext our entrees came out.  My friend ordered the Bangkok Chicken, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao no meat...  The Pad Kee Mao wasn't listed under the vegetarian section, but I didn't care... I'm allowed to be an irresponsible vegetarian and I finally ordered what the hell I wanted to without asking 20 questions of what's in the sauce... I didn't care I wanted to try something different and good and I was not disappointed.  \\n\\nFrom first bite, the Pad Kee Mao had me hooked...  It was flavorful, well cooked, and spicy as hell.  I already have big lips, but they got bigger from swelling from the spicy heaty goodness.  It was delicious, I let my friend try some and she said it was good.  The only thing I didn't care for were the tomatoes, but they didn't slow me down... I kept trying to pick up every single noodle on the plate, but there was nothing left... I think I entered into some form of after dinner depression when the meal was all gone... I even asked my friend how were people leaving with togo boxes... Our plates were clean...  \\n\\nMan all I can say is... will we be back??? damn skippy.  Only natural disasters better keep me away.  So glad my friend lives in the Buckhead area or I never would've suggested we stop by this place.  I hope this first try was no fluke and they hit me with their best shot the next time I go back...

The Scallops appetizer was seared beautifully and served with delicious savoury jams and crispy papadum. It is not a plate to share! My main course, the Lamb Shank, was equally scrumptious. The flavours of the night was elevated only by the bold Italian wine, glimmering in my glass. My dinner companion had high praises for the Sable Fish, as well. Now I wish we had had dessert. \\n\\nAfter dinner, we collected our coats from their complimentary coat check service and left for the Ballet.

We had tried to secure a 6:00 PM reservation, but was told that they were fully booked. The only option we had was to take the 5:00 PM sitting. Our reservation was for 2.5 hours, but will only be held if we sat at 5:00 PM. I didn't mind it as much, but it caused my dinner companion some inconvenience. She spoke with one of the employees and they defended their company policy, which angered my dinner companion even more. I thought it could have been handled better. Otherwise, the night was lovely, and I won't doubt our return."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We went to Craigie on Main for my graduation dinner. Initially, we were seated in the dining room, but after learning that the famous Craigie burger could only be ordered in the bar room (kind of a weird, nitpicky restriction, but maybe burger is bar food?), we asked if there were any available tables in the bar room, and there was - so we moved to a table there.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful - attentive, but not overly attentive. Our waiter was very gracious and attended to all the details of our meals. He also gave us great recommendations when we asked what the most popular/delicious dishes were.\\n\\nIf you are in the camp that believes that a restaurant's bread and butter are reflective of the quality of a restaurant's food (as I am), then Craigie on Main will not let you down. Craigie on Main serves a basket of bread pulled from a pain d'epi. The crust is crisp but not brittle, and the insides reveal a delightful crumb, with large air holes. Sour, soft, and slightly chewy, the bread is served with a high-quality, rich butter, the kind of sweet European butter that is rarely matched in America.\\n\\nWe started out with:\\n(1) Fried Pig's Tails - the most popular first course. Met our expectations - crispy, sweet and salty. Tony Maws is the master of the pig, as the logo of the restaurant suggests.\\n(2) Octopus - most succulent octopus flesh I've ever tasted. Very impressive.\\n(3) Ragout of boudin noir with farm fresh egg - boudin noir is black pudding. The ragout was a overly salty (a pattern I found with several of their dishes), but the farm fresh egg was cooked perfectly. I wish the incorporation of the fiddlehead ferns was more apparent, as the showcasing of that vegetable could have enhanced the meal even more. Plating was quite beautiful though.\\n(4) Bone Marrow (side order) - It's hard to be disappointed by bone marrow, especially with the thick slabs of crispy toast and large grains of sea salt that were served alongside, but in my opinion, the fatty creaminess of marrow is even more delicious when balanced out by the tang of a parsley/caper/garlic salad.\\n\\nOur main dishes were:\\n(1) Craigie on Main Burger - the medium-rare burger was perfectly cooked, with a touch of red at the center - so flavorful, juicy, and thick. More meat and less bun, which is how burgers should be served. We went without bacon, but that would have been a nice addition. This bougie burger is made more bougie by the accompaniments: housemade ketchup, celery root sauerkraut, and housemade pickles - but who can complain? Also served with fries that are tasty but not stellar.\\n(2) Pork three ways - Some Asian influences going on here. Meat was fall-off-the-bones tender. No complaints here.\\n(3) Glacee of Early Spring Vegetables - a mix of glaceed vegetables, including fiddlehead ferns, purple cauliflower, and turnips. This was actually a bit heavier than I would have liked, especially since such fresh vegetables are so beautiful, fresh, and tasty on their own that they seem weighed down by the excess oil. I love that the plating of the smoky, sweet mushrooms was a play on ribs/marrow. The grain pilaf was a nice mix of quinoa, wild rice, and farro, but I thought that the glaze that held them together was a bit thick and syrupy.\\n(4) Halibut with crab on top - a great pairing. The halibut was tender and flaky, which is impressive, given that halibut is usually a tougher fish.\\n\\nDessert:\\n(1) We all split the Banana Millefeuille (we went to Toscanini's afterwards - I would highly suggest doing the same! The best ice cream in all of Cambridge) - which was such a delightful dessert. The caramelized banana and crunchy caramel pieces are apt bitter accents to the moist (but not cloyingly sweet) banana cake - which is fluffy and light. A few dabs of foamed cream are delicious as well.\\n\\nThe cooking and service are superb here. The dishes were all salty, oily, and a bit on the heavier side, but Tony Maws has certainly perfected the art of cooking meat, and the care with which he treats food is readily apparent. Highly recommended, especially for a special occasion meal."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"No, no, no, no....\\nMy husband and gays were so amped to try this restaurant with me, and it was so incredibly disappointing. \\n\\n*The menu is a blippin' Sudoku puzzle, much like Get Sum Dim Sum, and it took us way too long to figure out how shiz was even organized.

We ordered a Diavola. This one has pepperoni and some sort of small spicy red chili peppers. All the pizzas come in one size so no need to decide how much you can eat. :) They wrote a number on your receipt and later, they'll find you based on that number. The seating is done in a communal way. The have a couple of bar like seating and a couple of large cafeteria style seating.

After four hours in a windowless room listening to a rather tedious lecture, we were given a one hour break for lunch. I wandered with two colleagues down to the airport food court but could not bring myself to eat there so I wandered back to the hotel. After a bit of wandering, I found McCoy's Bar & Grill. \\n\\nMcCoy's looks like a hotel restaurant, especially a Florida hotel restaurant. I don't know how to describe that look but it seems that every hotel I visit in this state, the restaurants all look alike. Is that a problem? No. Nevertheless, I do find it curious that every hotel seems to think that visitors to Florida all want to eat meals indoors in rooms that seem to imitate outdoor dining. But I digress. \\n\\nI was pleased to see that the menu at McCoy's was not materially more expensive than the menu at Panda Express in the food court (where my colleagues were to dine). I ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich which, as I recall, was served on a ciabatta roll with fresh arugula, mozzarella (at least I think it was mozzarella), tomato and a rather pleasant pesto-hummus. The sandwich was served with a side of sweet potato fries. All in all, the volume of food was good for the price tag of under $11.00. \\n\\nThe sandwich was better than most airport food but not wonderful by any stretch of the imagination. I expected the eggplant to be served warm but it was really quite cool. The ingredients were fresh and I appreciated that but the entire sandwich was difficult to chew through. Not a sandwich to order on a business outing. I was also dismayed that the sandwich was served with a drop of pesto hummus on the exterior of the bread. Presentation counts! \\n\\nThe sweet potato chips were attractively presented in a wire vase but were completely lacking in flavor. I also disliked the texture of the sweet potato chips which seemed much more like tortillas than potato chips. \\n\\nThe service at McCoy's was excellent and the dining room quiet and comfortable.

Now here's where we have some disagreement - my husband loved the grape leaves, I thought they were okay but not great.  I haven't had them in years so it might just be a personal taste thing.  The one thing we both thought was just okay were the falafel.  They were kind of dry and not overly flavorful, but they were hot and crispy and not at all greasy.

If you live in the South End, it is probably one of the best Italian joints you will find here but if you add Giacomo's to the larger pool of Italian restaurants in the greater Boston area, it gets diluted to just \\"Meh\\".\\n\\nFirst off, please make reservations. Its a busy restaurant in a tight ass spot! If you are forced to wait for a table, you could be stuck outside standing for hours.

The red sauce is really special and I guarantee you will finish off the bread to soak up every last ounce of flavor! \\n\\nFor entree dishes I've had Butternut Squash Ravioli, Lobster Ravioli, and Chicken Parmesan. All these dishes were definitely flavorful but not spectacular.  However, the Chicken Parmesan is really a must have here. I must say though, I was a little disheartened to receive my side of spaghetti cold, dry, and clumped together into a ball with no flavoring on it whatsoever.

He is very good at getting people in as quickly as possible, and he even took our order and explained the dishes very thoroughly and efficiently.

It was extremely fresh and flavorful with roasted red peppers, large beefy tomatoes, and a gigantic ball of mozzarella and cream.  This might have been the best caprese I've ever had.  Bread - not feelin' the olive loaf... it was bland.  The PASTA was most disappointing :(  I ordered the linguine with pesto and calamari.  The pesto had NO SALT or flavor!  The Parmesan they must have used was clearly low in salt.  The basil was fresh, but there was far too much oil.  Way too much.  It was not balanced with the other ingredients and made the plate hard to eat.  The calamari was chewy, and I was counting on Boston's seafood!  I ordered the Cabernet, and it was bitter and thick to drink :(  I was very disappointed.\\n\\nTo note, my friends were all entranced by their dishes... but they are not Italian, not raised on authentic Italian cooking, don't hail from NYC's italian neighborhood, and can't cook...................\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: I am extremely picky about my Italian...

Always a place for hipsters, wanna-be hipsters, and a varied array of homeless people, Little Five always seemed like the mini-bohemia that the overly conservative OTP-ers never took a liking to. For me, it was love at first sight but for some strange and odd reason, amongst all the hype of The Vortex and The Corner Pub, I never noticed The Porter Beer Bar. It looks like the afterthought of a building, like when you have to hastily insert a \\"1\\" that you omitted into a number; The Porter takes up a sliver of the walls of shops that line up along Euclid. It's really hard to notice, a small rather dull sign hangs outside and if you weren't searching for it, you wouldn't think it were anything special, almost like 12 Grimmauld Place (for you Harry Potter fans). \\n\\n My first time here I stumbled in hoping that I hadn't made some horrid mistake. I took two rather skeptical looking British boys in here, who whined their entire trip that I hadn't given them a single decent beer. For those who are familiar with the British, there is an innate understanding of their love of two things: complaining and a \\"proper pint.\\" All in all, it seemed to be dismal until I pulled a stool up onto the bar and the bartender handed me their beer menu; three stellar pages of draught beer from microbreweries. Beer geeks, this is heaven, even the Brits were smiling by the end of it. And hey, if you're not a drinker their menu is phenomenal as well. In fact, when I perused their selection I was more impressed with their food menu. Foie gras, bone marrow, and goat cheese fritters all with a good pint? It was bound to be an everlasting relationship. It's good to see a place that serves quality and trendy food without the high-roller bullshit. I guess that's the beauty of being a gastropub, you get the best of graffiti-ed and stickered out bathrooms, tattoo-ed bartenders and waiters, and amazing food and quality beer. Their taps rotate constantly, every time I've been in the beer has been different but with that said this place will run you up a pretty penny. Again, though, my general motto is you pay for what you get and the constantly rotating taps, the stellar food, and good company is well worth the extra $10-$20 you pay.\\n\\n Now, I know I'm notorious for long winded reviews but this last bit I felt I needed. For those who enjoy a good atmosphere and just to bring out the liveliness of the bar, talk to people and get to know your bartender. This was one of the best things about this bar; people really seemed to enjoy talking to strangers or other people. Perhaps it's just the Little Five atmosphere, since I experienced the same hospitality at \\"Wrecking Bar\\" just down the street.  \\n\\n All in all, it's a fantastic place. As usual, for those who frequent Little Five, parking is an absolute NIGHTMARE so try and go during the daytime if you want to avoid the hellfire that is parking in Little Five Points.  So stop reading this and go...

I got the scallops and shrimp. for $16, it was a huge filling entree with lots of seafood and plenty of leftovers for another meal. 2 of my companions got the mussels. And 1 of them got the ziti with chicken and shrimp in a cream sauce..he finished it so i guess it was good!\\nAnyway, the food was ordered and in front of us before we knew it.

I remember driving away from the hospital seeing a stoic expression on the face in the mirror.  Not that the news was all that unexpected, but I was feeling a strange sick and yet hungry pang in the pit of my stomach. Sitting there at a red light, I asked my GPS to find Lola's and I decided, I was going to have a good lunch, not gonna get all down, I'm still alive. \\nSurprisingly, it was a short drive and I was standing at her counter in just minutes. Funny thing was, I stood there a good 15-20 minutes while Lola and two of her friends prayed over an upcoming trip or vacation someone was about to embark on. I tried to be patient, I smiled at her several time when she indicated it would just be a few more minutes. Finally, they said their goodbyes and Lola walk over to me and apologized. I told her I understood and she asked if I was ready to order. Maybe it was the quirky look I gave her, or maybe, just maybe she could see colors about my head, but she moaned and made haste around the counter, grabbing me and said, \\" you have bad news, don't you?\\" \\"Are you hurting anywhere?\\" I said yes and no, I didn't share the particulars... She pulled my head to her shoulder and prayed for my healing. I have to admit, I was a little freaked out, but I could feel her warm and loving spirit, something this world needs more of, not withstanding this writer. \\nMaybe it was the day, maybe the heat, or some undefined swirling inside my head, but my etouffee wasn't all that good.

NO!!!  \\n\\nBut hey... no harm as long as they got them delicious hot dogs, right?  Sure... except 'Bite Hot Dogs' is now officially 'Bite Rockin Burgers'.

I no longer have any reason trek my way out to Bite.  I can't understand why they would ditch Excellence (their Signature hot dogs) for Mediocrity (their burgers).  It was good while it lasted.   Seriously, if I want a burger, 5 Guys, Backyard Burger and Steak N Shake are all a stone's throw away. \\n\\nAnother reviewer stated the last time they went, it was a 'ghost town'.  Anytime I had been to Bite, it was always packed and busy.

The first thing that was shoved in our faces was a small menu that had a list of options of sauces, fish, etc that you could put over pasta. The waitress spoke very quickly so I could hardly understand what she was talking about. In addition to this menu there was a menu on a large blackboard on the wall. The waitress was back in two to three minutes asking what we wanted for dinner. My daughter quickly said is it okay for us to order some appetizers. We ordered the Calamari and a Cesar salad. Both dishes were pretty good.  I had to call the waitress over to ask if we could order some wine. She brought the wine and asked us what we wanted for dinner. We hadn't even started eating our appetizers or had even a sip of wine. I told the waitress I hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. She said I'll come back to you. I thought she was going to give us time, but no she wanted to take our orders right away going to the three other people in our party to take their orders. I ordered the calamari with the Giacomo sauce. It was the worst dish of pasta I've ever had. It's not really what I wanted since I never had a chance to read the menu board. The dish was filled with salt. My husband ordered white clam sauce, my son ordered veal marsala and my daughter ordered linguini with scallops and shrimp. All of these dishes were extremely salty as well. Maybe it was just a fluke that all the dishes were so salty. The scallop and shrimp dish had two shrimp and four very small scallops. We were never asked about coffee and dessert. We arrived when the restaurant opened at 4p.m. and we were finished and out the door before 5 pm. There are so many good restaurants on Salem Street that have great food and service.

Isn't it cool?? -with gin liquor, pineapple syrup, lime juice , the flavour is a mix of sweet / sour / tangy. Another drinks that we tried were \\"Gatsby's Garden\\" mix of vodka,lime,sparkling wine...  Zero proof are the non alcoholic drinks- one of it is lassi sauvage( indian staple) . My tastebuds were tickling reading the food items n i wanted to try them all which wasn't possible . So, we decided to order 4 different options which were \\"Ratatouille \\"( vegetarian) \\"Thon au miso\\" ( tuna with kale , broccoli) i would say the portion was less for big appetite. \\"Canard et Gnochi\\" ( duck breast) My mouth waters when i think of it now. N i forgot the name of 4th one but i have pic for you guys. \\nWashrooms are nit only clean but quite spacious n plenty of toiletries on hand. \\nIs there anything bad to say? Not that i want to but its expensive for my pocket. Its suitable for a date though"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I've decided to give this place four out of five stars.  I know its tantamount to heresy to not worship The Salt Lick, but along with the many pluses are some minuses, too.\\n\\nYes, the food is very good in general.  The brisket, turkey, sausage, and ribs were all very good, but not so much more so than several other places I go to.\\n\\nThe coleslaw is great.  No mayonnaise, fresh and delicious.  The potatoes are non-descript, and I don't like the bread there.  Its so heavy that its not a good complement to the meats.\\n\\nI'm a fan of their sauce, but its definitely on the sweeter side.  Frankly, its so different than any other place around that it gets a star just for that.\\n\\nThe drive blows.  Its pretty in the surrounding area, but a trip down Mopac and through Circle C ain't my idea of  fun.\\n\\nThey had a decent band playing classic rock covers - in their own \\"inimitable style\\" - and the wait for a party of 16 was pretty minimal.  The weather was gorgeous today, but I could see getting impatient if it was August and it was 100 degrees outside.\\n\\nThe picnic table we sat at was sticky and kind of gross actually.  It was not super hot outside, so I can only surmise that the stickiness was the residue of some earlier diners.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I like The Salt Lick, but not as much as most seem to.  Its great for large groups like we had today, for sure.  But its not exactly inexpensive, and the drive will keep it as just an occasional diversion from my regular, in-town BBQ places."},{"name":"Tamarind Indian Cuisine","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 149","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely incredible!

The first bad impression was the host who seated us at our table without saying anything to us.  Things started fine when our waitress came over to take our order.  Our meals came so fast that they arrived about 10 seconds after the bread and our cocktails.  The food was pretty good.  I had the duck confit ravioli, and the flavor was nice but the pasta was a little chewy.  We finished our meals and then proceeded to wait 40 minutes for the waitress to come over to our table.  Never once did she come over to check how the meal was or to offer another drink or refill our water glasses.  She then cleared our table without saying one word.  It would have been nice for her to apologize for the fact that we waited for 40 minutes with empty plates in front of us, or at that point to ask how the meal had been.  Then she dropped dessert menus on our table without allowing us a chance to ask for the check.  There was a dessert that I heard was good and really wanted to try, so while we were dying to leave the restaurant by this point, we decided that if she came back to our table in 5 minutes we would order the dessert.  She did not come back in 5 minutes, so by the time she finally did come over we just asked for the check and left as quickly as possible.  We did also hear the waitress ask one of the hosts to stop f*ing seating her tables for a little while which was extremely unprofessional language to use in front of customers.  Presumably due to her request, the table next to us sat empty for an hour while many people were waiting to be seated for dinner.  There seemed to be a lot of chaos, which you might expect from a restaurant that had just opened but that is not the case with this Aquitaine.

Now at three locations (Winter Park, Downtown and Lake Mary), this is one of the few restaurants that really lives up to its billing. Primarily a steakhouse, they excel with beef. Their aged steaks are quite good, and the carpaccio I had recently was melt-in-your-mouth good. Even their burger is perhaps the greatest burger I have ever had!\\n\\nIn addition to steaks, they also have a respectable selection of seafood and other things. Their bar is top-notch, with a great selection of top shelf liquors and several beers on tap. The service is always friendly, and the meal is nicely paced to promote a relaxed, conversational evening. If at the downtown location, be sure to get a seat overlooking Lake Eola for a memborable evening. The prices are reasonable for the quality (most entrees in the $20-$30 range), and I really can't recommend Spice highly enough.\\n\\n--ORIG--\\n\\nIn Winter Park, where everything seems a little overhyped, I think this place stands up well. The bar is in a separate room, is very well-stocked, and the bartenders pay attention to what they are doing to make an excellent drink. In addition, they often have quite good beers on tap.\\n\\nThe food was also wonderful; the salmon on a plank I tried was perfectly cooked, with and incredible relish on top. My steak was cooked correctly, though I can't say it was outstanding.

We also got two of the fruit drinks - mine was good but my husband's - the Mustang - had way to much ginger.\\n\\nOverall we think this place will be successful once they work out the kinds of running a restaurant that is going to be in high demand.

Both times I ate there I really felt they were rushing us out, and the mood of all the servers felt very hectic.

The last time I was there, we were asked if we could move to another table while we finished dessert!\\n\\nWhat this resto needs to learn is that it is less important to rush people in and out to get your numbers up, but better to give people a more relaxing experience so they can digest their meals in peace. Also the last 2 times we went early so as to avoid the hectic pace, it was still there. One of us left our take home container on the table by accident, ran back in and they had thrown it out, and didn't offer to give us a new one!

I received a confirmation email, we arrived on time, and we were seated right away. The hostess was slightly condescending (as others have mentioned regarding the staff), but our server was very polite and patient. \\n\\nBread was supplied to begin the meal, and we added before-dinner drinks and split the Vine Ripe Tomato & Buffalo Mozzarella Salad. My whiskey sour was mixed perfectly (and nice and strong). My boyfriend, who does not like tomatoes, was amazed at how much he enjoyed the salad (and is, in fact, still talking about it a couple of days later). It was the perfect beginning to our meal--the flavors worked together perfectly and the mozzarella in particular tasted rich and fresh.\\n\\nHe handled the wine, so I didn't even look at the list, but the folder in which it was contained was much thicker than the menus. We wound up with a lovely Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon, and I loved it. (Although, as always, $130 for a bottle of wine is a bit of a stretch!)\\n\\nFor the entrees, I ordered the chef's special 6 oz. filet with Caribbean lobster tail, and my boyfriend had the regular filet. The food arrived quickly after the salad plates were cleared, but with plenty of time for us to ready ourselves for the next course. The steak was cooked to perfection--I would say it's probably the best steak I've ever had, but I'm certainly no steakhouse connoisseur. The lobster tail was just the right amount of spicy and perfectly portioned. It was also easy enough to remove from the shell without making too much of a fool out of myself in public. \\n\\nWe ordered the sweet potato casserole and the broccoli au gratin for sides. They provided the perfect blend of sweet and salty and I would say that the sweet potato casserole tops my list of best side dishes ever. \\n\\nAlso, since it was his birthday, they provided us with a complementary dessert. We opted for the creme brulee to share, and although it was a little sweet for my boyfriend's tastes (as creme brulee is apt to be, I'm sure), he still ate his half and enjoyed every bite.\\n\\nThe bill was no higher than I expected it to be, and both food and service were top-notch. We left full, almost bursting, and definitely satisfied. Although I don't like paying so much for a single dinner for two, I recognize that the penny-pinching part of myself won't change and that I'd best get used to high prices if I want to have some fun every once in awhile. (Hence the decision not to remove a star for prices, as I originally planned.) And, overall, it was just that--a pleasant, enjoyable evening in the city at a restaurant I'd love to return to for another special occasion. And the experience was indeed worth the price (or, at least, it came very close)."},{"name":"Luce","address":"2138-2140 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Disappointed.

I'd like a margarita! And then 10 minutes later, he'd hand you a margarita and ask if you want to keep the tab open. God forbid you don't want to keep your tab open! More rolling of the eyes. I didn't even finish my margarita because it was so gross. I am 100% positive that he did not put any tequila in mine. I compared to my friend's drinks and mine tasted like orange juice and limeaide.

And, that's only one example... this review could get a whole lot longer. But, I'll just end with the fact that I did not tip this bartender 20% I made the decision to tip him just 10% for his crappy service and crappy margarita. Now, I have worked as a waitress and busgirl and know that you can just have a bad day and it's awful not to get tipped, but that's how bad this guy really was. I ALWAYS tip 20% and could not bring myself to give this guy a good tip on principle alone. Just this morning the charge showed up on my bank statement and that bitchy bartender added more money on to my tip! After talking with my friends who were with me that night, I am not the only one who had a charge greater than what they wrote and signed for at the bar.

They have two girls taking orders which was nice and Im sure it speeds up the lunch wait time.

They have the classic dogs, the chili-cheese the chicago, the kraut, and some others, and they also have a couple other dogs on the menu that are custom concoctions Ive never seen before such as the Loaded Chili-Cheese dog, and the Loaded Baked Potato dog, which both looked amazing and sounded awesome.

No burnt fries and not many throw aways imo. The dogs were assembled the way I like em, the chicago is a chicago is a chicago, but the chili-cheese dog was great because they actually put the dog first then the cheese then the chili, which is perfect because the chili melts the cheese down just enough. And the onions and mustard on top. The dogs are served with poppy seed authentic vienna buns, and the chili can be made with beans or without for the non hearty version.\\n\\n2 dogs and fries were more than enough to fill me up, id have to say that I really like this joint for now, and I will definitely continue to return there when im in the area.

We went on a Friday night around 7:30-8:00 and it was crowded, but we were seated right away at a two-top in the bar area. Our waitress came over to us quickly to take drink orders and was very friendly, asked if we had questions about the menu, etc. The regular menu has a wide variety of pasta, meat, seafood and pizza, and there was also a page of specials, making the decision even harder. I went with the chicken saltimbocca and my boyfriend chose the frutti di mare with a spicy tomato sauce. We also ordered a side of broccoli rabe, which was very good. Before our meals came out, we also devoured the basket of bread and oil that was dropped off. The bread was a focaccia accompanied with I think a basil oil, and I honestly would have been happy just having that as my meal because it was so tasty. Almost filled up from bread and broccoli rabe, our dinner was served. The food was piping hot (not just the plates, like some other places) and the portions were large. My saltimbocca was two thin chicken breasts topped with prosciutto, cheese and sauce, accompanied with a few lovely, crispy potatoes and zucchini/squash. The squash could have used some salt or some seasoning as it tasted kind of plain, but was very good with the sauce from the chicken. The frutti di mare came with calamari, shrimp and at least a dozen mussels. The portion was enough to take home and have for lunch the next day. I wish we didn't fill up on bread because the desserts that went to the table next to us looked SO good. When we were done, it took a while to get our check because it looked like our waitress was the only one waiting on all of the tables, which seems very odd for a Friday night, but after she brought the check, she was quick to process the groupon and finish cashing us out (btw - prices are VERY reasonable, we barely hit the $50 value of the groupon).

I eat really healthily and this place gives you the perfect ability to do that and still have delicious food.

It's a ton of food and I eat a lot. My girlfriend always has leftovers to take back home. The price is $12 a bowl and for the amount and what you are getting that's a really good value. Normally this is a chirashi type of meal with appetizers of edamame or seaweed salad at a sushi restaurant which will run you about $25 or more so this really is great deal. They have dole whip desserts which are fantastic for the once a week we splurge on our diets.

The only reason I have gone multiple times is because it is a block away from work. I recently visited Spain and it is really difficult to have tapas in the US after my experiences in Spain. \\nMy main issue with tapas restaurants is the freshness of the food. Even in Spain, most chefs make large quantities in the morning and serve that food throughout the day. Meaning if you go to a tapas restaurant for dinner around 10pm, the good is 12+ hours old because it was probably prepared at 10am that morning. That thought makes me lose my appetite altogether. However several restaurants in Spain cook the food fresh to order, you just have to do some detective work from speaking to the locals as well as trip advisor and yelp. \\n\\nBack to my point, Kikas actually has fresh food which is prepared to order. Probably because the restaurant is always empty so if they prepared food in bulk they would waste food and lose money. I am guessing the reason the restaurant is always empty is because of the prices. I have only been here during lunch and most of the other restaurants in Kendall Square are significantly cheaper for lunch.\\n\\nThe food is mediocre. I have tried the following tapas dishes:\\n\\nImported marinated olives\\nFire roasted peppers\\nWild and spicy potatoes\\nBroccoli and cauliflower fritters \\nSaut√©ed baby spinach with pine nuts and raisins \\nCeviche\\n\\nMost of these dishes are not bad. I suggest trying the wild and spicy potatoes and the broccoli and cauliflower fritters, especially if you are a vegetarian. I am not a huge meat eater so I have not tried any of the meat dishes. I have heard mixed opinions from others. I have also tried the Paella, which I did not like at all. \\n\\nFrom the lunch menu, my favorite salad is the endive salad served with endives, blue cheese, spiced walnuts, and orange segments. This salad is unique and quite refreshing.\\n\\nOverall, if you are in Kendall Square and have to stay in the area, I guess you could try this place out.

The waitress did not offer to substitute the fettucinni with linguini but instead suggested that they were similar. I thought that was a bit tacky but we left well enough alone.\\n\\nThe food quickly followed a garden salad which was fresh but a bit plain. The large portions presented well and were piping hot. The sliced peppers, onions and mushrooms were crisp and fresh and the sauce had a pleasant tanginess. The chicken was a bit tough and I felt that it may possibly have been frozen and the pasta was well cooked although I tend to prefer it cooked a bit more al dente. My wife was pleased with her entree and described it as fresh and well balanced. A short time into the meal is became evident that we were missing one crucial element for both of these dishes. Bread! It took almost 10 minutes to get the waitresses attention despite the fact that there was only one other occupied table in the entire restaurant but when the bread did finally come it was hot and tasty.\\n\\nUpon finishing our meal the waitress quickly cleared out plates and dropped the check on the table without offering coffee or dessert.

The service and the ambiance are very nice, everyone is solicitous and helpful, as well they should be for the prices you are paying. I had the prix fixe which includes first course, main course, and dessert (no glass of wine), for $67.  The pumpkin soup I had for first course ($18 a la carte) was nearly tasteless.  And the brisket I had for the main was also pretty bland.  All main dishes are $38 a la carte.  Prices (and it should be noted if you are concerned about such things, you shouldn't be here) are located way at the bottom of the menu. I was also disturbed that my main was served lukewarm, atop a small mound of root vegetables and one lonely shiitake. I could have sent it back to be reheated yet realized that would not improve the flavor (are the cooks tasting the food?  I'm not a fan of oversalting, either, and I once criticized Sportello for this. Seasoning, however, I do appreciate).  My friend's main of chicken with whiskey soaked apricots was also bland and she said it was also served lukewarm.  The third person in our group simply had a first course and a dessert since she isn't made of money, and she had no specific complaints, but didn't rave about her choices either.  For dessert I had a tasty affogato with spearmint ice cream (finally, a flavor!), yet it was served in a glass similar to a pint glass with a long, large spoon, so I had to dig for it and eat it awkwardly with a utensil meant for soup.  Low marks for presentation and user-friendliness there; a simple white bowl and smaller spoon would make more sense.  Our total bill with tip came to about $240 and I'm wondering if each person needs to spend at least $100 to be taken seriously here?

I explained what happened, and his answer? \\"Oh\\". Done. Done. Done. \\n\\nFood: NOT GREAT. I have been to Italy, this is not what pizza in Italy is like. It was burnt on one side, and the pepperoni was so greasy, there were pools of grease in the dough pockets. Disgusting. The to-go canoli? Mushy crust, and no flavour. \\n\\nParking: 4 blocks away because it was so packed. \\n\\nAll in all, total waste of time. And the fact that it was over $35 for a pizza and a couple sodas was not lost on me. \\n\\nI know this review will not dissuade people from checking this place out, but I just hope your experience was better than mine.

They need to focus on the beautiful and delicious plates they are making, not on Mr. Indecisive. If they just used the servers at all areas of the restaurant, things would move a lot better. The food was great, but really not to filling. Since the plates are small portions you really need more than 5 plates to fill 2 people. We ended up getting the Hokey Pokey, Green Dragon, and 2 plates of nigiri. While it was fantastic, it wasn't enough, o well we still had dessert to go to, means more sweets.

I do have to say that the tomatoes they use on their pizza are good, I like a sweet  tomatoe sauce so this plays right into what I look for in a pizza. There could have been more cheese on the pizza but for the thickness of the Crust I think it works. I dont have much else to compare this to in Boston other then Reginas, which is probably the best pie I have had in Boston.

Service was very fast but really didn't feel rushed. Based in part on prior reviews, we had their garlic bread (very good, unusual with a bit of cheese on top as well), one of their fettuccini dishes with chicken, peppers, in a waitress-recommended blend of 2 of their spicier tomato sauces, and one of their daily specials which was a fusilli dish with shrimp, lobster, and scallops.

Alexander's is a reasonably priced gem in a highly saturated restaurant row filled with high priced options. \\n\\nThe location is not bad.  Its in with a couple other restaurants and stores.  Parking is a bit of a pain, but I still would not recommend the valet.  The restaurant itself is a little dark, with an open kitchen concept.  The design is such that even with a crowd, the restaurant stays pretty quiet.  Service is generally pretty good and above average, although it can be a little slow. Even on the slow days the staff is cheerful and ready to help.\\n\\nThe food is good, quality American fare.  As an appetizer, my kids love the spinach con queso.  It is a fair size of dip with an abundance of chips.  Personally I love the onion rings.  They are enormous! You could literally use the smallest of them as an adult bracelet.  \\n\\nEntrees are generally quite large and will leave little room for dessert.  The cheeseburger is good, but the French dip and prime rib sandwiches are well above average, and are priced well.  The steaks and prime rib are also good choices.  Again, they are good sized meals, with generous portions of sides.  The mac and cheese is a must have side.  Its big enough to share between two people, very rich and creamy. While I tend to like a southern style mac and cheese, this is among the top five I have eaten.  The pork tenderloin is delicious, but the flavor of the pork is masked by the slightly spicy bang bang sauce.  Crab cakes will not leave you loosening your belt, but are very good with large chunks of crab.  As a pasta dish, the Rattlesnake pasta is very good, and again, not outrageously priced.  The kids love the chicken tenders, which are flavorfully breaded and fried.  They are a good choice as there is no formal children's menu.  That being said, the kitchen has always been willing to put something together to make the kids happy.\\n\\nAs for desserts, if you still have room,  skip everything but the carrot cake.  Its served warm with melty cream cheese icing and is just beyond delicious.  If you just cant stand warm melty goodness, go ahead and get the key lime pie, or creme brulee.  Both are serviceable, and would be good desserts on any menu, but pale in comparison to the carrot cake.\\n\\nJ Alexanders takes reservations, and they are apparently recommended, but I have found they are usually not needed unless going with a group larger than four people."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Don't we just LOVE hype?

I went in on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't that crowded.  The drink selection was a bit overwhelming with everything screaming \\"sweet drinks\\" at me.  If you are in the mood for a margarita, you are in luck.  I settled with a beer on tap, easy enough.\\n\\nI really liked the decor in the restaurant.  Funky lights and a nice view, great for a Sunday afternoon.  The music was a bit random.  I consider it as hits of the 70's to today.  Definitely a wide range and not what I would have anticipated.  The service was alright.\\n\\nThe guacamole is made at the tableside and I had mine extra spicy.  It was really good!  The individual who made my guacamole made it just right.  It was well balanced, fresh, spicy, flavorful, and I loved the cilantro in it.  Yum!  It's cool that they serve the guacamole in a molcajete (mortar).  I suggest ordering the half-size portion for 2 people.  The tortilla chips were a bit thicker than I'm usually accustomed to.  These chips were seasoned with what tastes like a slightly sweet chili seasoning.  If you eat these plain, it'll taste bland unless you get one of the ones that were heavily seasoned.  It was different but tasted a whole lot better with the guacamole.\\n\\nAs far as the menu goes, there's tacos (obviously), quesadillas, salads, sandwiches, enchiladas, specialties and some entrees served in a heated molcajete.  I'm always a fan of trying multiple things so I ordered three tacos, the cochinitas achiote (slow roasted pork), chorizo, and blackened mahi.  I tried some of the carne asada, and my first thought was \\"eh.\\"  My cochinitas achiote had a nice reddish color (as expected).  With my first bite I thought it tasted flavorful but after two to three bites later, it was just salty.  My friend agreed with me.  No salt on the chips and all on the cochinitas achiote.  The chorizo is not spicy at all.  I had to ask the server to make sure I got the right dish because it really just looked like ground beef.  I could only wonder what the carne molida (spicy ground beef would taste like).  Last but not least, I had the blackened mahi taco.  This was one pretty good.  Nice seasoning on the fish.  The cotija cheese didn't really add much to my tacos.  I was left underwhelmed with the tacos (aside from the mahi).\\n\\nAll in all, good guacamole, great view, enjoyable atmosphere, mediocre tacos.

I get that restaurant employees are statistically much more likely to smoke than the rest of the population, but for non-smokers and health conscious individuals, cigarette plumes perpetrated by the very person who would presumably be making your sandwich, directly in front the sub shop, just screams out in vivid technicolor letters: \\"AVOID.\\" \\n\\nMoreover, it's actually against the local law to smoke so close to the front door of a business. While I'm generally against any laws like that, I'd think Subway would want its employees to stay on the right side of ordinances that have been on the books for decades.

I mean it was 7 PM and there were like 3 tables IN TOTAL. And the place is by any means small. At least it was roomy. I've been to enough Korean restaurants so I could compare.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\nSashimi Appetizer - Salmon was not fresh - had a fishy taste. The tuna was basically one piece cut into 3 pieces. \\n\\nSpicy Scallop Roll - Worse thing we ordered all night. Scallop had a different texture than regular scallop - it was very mushy - scallops usually have a denser bite than that. The so called \\"spicy\\" was the Korean hot sauce and not the spicy mayo that usually goes into sushi. Maybe they should have said that in the menu. Disgusting. Moreover, we sent it back and did not get a refund on it. All 6 pieces were still intact.\\n\\nSalmon Avo Roll - Edible - nothing great. \\n\\nJap Chae - very very very oily. I know Jap Chae has a lot of oil in it anyways but this one was like dunked in pan of oil.\\nKorean Pancake - A bit dry - not enough kimchi in it.\\n\\nBulgolgi - This was so disgusting. It was not real bulgolgi at all. It was dry unmarinated shredded pork. It has no flavor - texture was gross, it wasn't like meat - more like doughy pieces of meat - it had an aftertaste with it too. \\n\\nKalbi - Kalbi is supposed to have fat. BUT not this much fat - the kalbi had more fat than beef! \\n\\nIn terms of service, the Waiter was meh. When we ordered, he was staring at the other table behind us. Not sure why. It took us half an hour after asking 3 different waiters/waitresses to get our bill. What is soooo hard about getting our bill?! Ridiculous. On top of that an 18% gratuity was included in a party of 5. I think it's supposed to be a party of 6 or more that gratuity gets included.

I ended up pulling the fish out of the batter shell to eat. The garlic fries are tasty but whoooweee!!!! A breath mint won't be enough to overcome the intense flavor, so make sure everyone eats some. My only annoyance was the basket the fish and chips came in. It was really tiny and the fish sat on top of the fries, so it was hard to eat, and since I wasn't eating the batter I had a mess of batter on the table. \\n\\nSecond time around, I had an apple salad (a special that day with arugula, apples, candied walnuts, and blue cheese dressing). It was tasty and the salad dressing was sparingly applied, which I like! I also had the fanciest, bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit I've ever had. I loved the herbed biscuit (never had that before), and the bacon was perfectly, perfectly cooked. They also had a plum preserve that day, and it was yummy, tasted like Christmas with sugar plums, cranberries, and orange. Of course, the biscuit came on the smallest plate I've ever seen used in a restaurant that wasn't for lemon slices. What's up with the tiny serving dishes? \\n\\nMy friend had the scrambler dish and she liked the omelet with mushrooms (san onions and goat cheese on the side) and the herbed biscuit, but she said the grits were too cheesy.

But both the savory and sweet ones were quite good, and the cappuccino was lovely.\\n\\nOne thing that did bug me and took away from it was serving everything on paper plates and in paper cups (yet with real silverware). It's super wasteful and made it actually a lot harder to eat the crepe (they're not folded up to eat with your hands, they're laid out flat so you have to use a fork), plus hey for a $48 lunch (two savory, two dessert, coffee & soda) it'd be nice to have real plates.

After almost 25 minutes, we finally had this one. Pro: nice presentation, huge portion, a lot of seafood in it. Here is the reason why I rated it down, the seafood does not taste good, the shrimp meat almost let me feel that I was chewing gummy bear. I am not Spanish, and I don't know if the ingredients are not right or just my Chinese taste wasn't feeling it, the rice tastes so ordinary, and buhaochi:(, some unknown ingredients messed up the rice, maybe this is the way American or Europeans like, but definitely for me. And the price, nearly 75 dollars for a plate, hey! This is not Michelin started restaurant yet.

Maybe this location is not as good as the others because it is located within GA Tech's campus... lower quality standards, and it is probably staffed by GT students. GOOO DAWGS! \\n\\nAllegiances aside, I really was not impressed with this restaurant. We waited a decent amount of time to place our order, even though there were only a few people in front of us in line. Once we placed our order, we went to look for seating. There were not many seats available as there were a lot of students who clearly had posted up and had been there for a while. Oh to be a student again! We found some tables and pulled them together, but they all had plates and dishes on them from the previous people. We waited and waited for a server to come and clear the tables, but they didn't finally, we went inside and informed someone the tables needed to be bussed and again waited, it took nearly 30 minutes for our tables to be cleared... even though our food had started to come out. Not ideal to have dirty dishes on the table when your food is coming out. \\n\\nWhen we finally got the tables cleared and received our food, it was meh. The sandwich that I got (veggie) was nothing fancy, not too flavorful nor unique in any way. The salad was just your run of the mill side salad. One of the people who had come with us was about to take a bite of her grilled cheese (which looked really good) when she saw a hair in it. She has black hair and this was clearly not a hair from her head. She took her plate back inside and told them. When she came back out she no longer had a plate and looked ticked. Apparently they didn't believe that there was a hair and told her she needed to show them exactly where it was, then claimed it wasn't theirs... seriously!?!

I'm glad we did. After a lazy Sunday mass at The Shrine of St. Anthony with the Arch St Band (can you give a mass 5 stars? No matter what Christian denomination?), a lazy fruit & bagel and newspaper breakfast, we decided to walk. After taking time to see the North church, Paul Revere\`s house , a 1700's print shop and chocolate shop we ambled over to Giacomo's (our REAL destinationI). It was 35 minutes  before their 4 pm opening and there was already a MA family in line. We followed. He came from Italy 25 years ago and lives west of Boston but travels into the North end 2 to 3 times a year. He remembers his first meal of swordfish over linguine.\\n\\nNow, do you need to hear about the food? We ordered the broccoli and garlic and enjoyed it until the \\"small\\" calamari arrived. That was hot, crisp and tender. It demanded to be eaten. Now.\\n\\nIn a timely way, our entrees arrived (you sensed that our waitress,Dina, was watching but not hovering). We went in with separate intentions but ended up both ordering the homemade fusilli with shrimp and lobster (lots of It!).

Short on staff and overall they need to get it together and be more professional because it's just a big mess right now."},{"name":"Alfredo's","address":"229 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"The difficulties about rating Alfredo's fairly is that people often overlook the fact that it's a tiny 3-4 table, sub-shop looking, one man show. He is able to offer a real taste of Italy thru a tiny, literally hole-in-the-wall, shop and charges at very reasonable prices. So I think the standard applied here should not come from the same perspective of \\"North End Standard\\". Personally, I think North End is good at \\"WOW-ing\\" customers with decoration, music and high priced menu, but the quality is no more than average. \\n\\nBack to Alfredo's, I have never used his deliver service, because like most good restaurants I enjoy, the food is just not the same after being packaged and delivered... But every single time I dined there, I find myself highly satisfied with the experience Alfredo is able to offer. First of all, Alfredo's menu, while it's simple and almost humble, it offers a decent variety of authentic Italian meals. Some of the sandwiches or pasta may seem over simplified with not a lot of \\"stuff\\" in it, however correctly reflects how Italians (IN ITALY) actually eat their food. Secondly, apart from the authenticity, Alfredo is very capable at producing amazing flavors in short period of time and all the food is homemade and fresh--and the portions are huge, I never finish the pasta, it's good for 2 meals. Thirdly, I like to comment on the atmosphere of the restaurant. I think Alfredo made a good effort turing that little shoe-box of a store into an authentic looking Italian cafe. The tables and chairs he uses, the decorations he put up really warmed up the place. The inside is nothing like what one would expect passing through from outside. The only downside is that it is very small, it gets crowded at times and I don't always like to sit so close to other people while i eat...but I am totally willing to sacrifice my personal preference for the food there.\\n\\nLast but not least, I often read/heard about people complain that Alfredo can't speak clearly and his attitude is bad...etc etc. Well, guess what everyone? I think he's a super friendly, warm and funny typical Italian. Yes he speaks fast with heavy accent, because he didn't move to the U.S. until 2000, English is far from being his first language (hardly is it even second I'd say), and just in case you don't know this, Italians (from Italy) speaks super fast. As for his attitude, I think the poor English skill made a lot of people uncomfortable and criticize him for having bad attitude because of miscommunication. Plus, give him a break, he has to be the waiter, the cook, the server, the cleaner...all by himself, he's probably too busy/tired to realize that he's not \\"pleasing\\" you. If you ever have the chance to eat there and happen to be interested in sports you should try to talk to him about it, He gets so excited and you'll find that he's actually a very nice guy!"},{"name":"Another Broken Egg Cafe","address":"4745 B Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Whenever I am in the mood for vegan pancakes or an early morning breakfast before running errands, I visit this ABEG location. \\nYELP has a waitlist (which is so convenient) which makes waiting less stressful .\\n\\nABEG has Louisiana inspired food so you'll find a lot of seafood breakfast/brunch options on their menu.\\n\\nThe service is good, the order:food speed is great and whenever Alli is there you are certain to get service with energy and a smile! \\n\\nShe makes going an extra treat!

Strike one.\\n\\nWhen the doors opened, I was greeted by a young, hip group of waiters and waitresses, to the soundtrack of some mediocre, top-40ish club music blaring over their sound system - exactly what I DON'T want to see in a supposedly traditional, authentic ramen place. The service was far from friendly, but short of being rude, although in order to be seated, my waitress had to remove a cell phone charging on my table. Strike two.\\n\\nAlright! I can deal with stupid music and bad service, if the food provided is incredible. I'm willing to look past these things, given that my level of satisfaction with the edibles is more than sufficient.\\n\\nThe food is literally terrible. I ordered two overpriced pork buns; while the bun was decent, and the pork was ok, why on earth is there mayonnaise...? Superfluous condiments aside, the mediocrity of the other ingredients, at the price tag of $6 for two tiny buns, certainly did not bode well for the ramen to come.\\n\\nAnd boy, what a travesty the ramen was. Undercooked noodles. Bland pork. Even blander broth - although the flavors that really soared through were onion (WAYYYY to much), and inexplicably, butter. The best part about the ramen was my egg, and even that was just ok. AND, if the piss-poor execution wasn't enough, the bowl was tiny compared to other ramen establishments (see: Pikaichi, which serves VASTLY superior ramen), PLUS it's fairly expensive. Essentially, I overpaid for a laughably underwhelming dinner.\\n\\nIt is fairly rare for me to leave a restaurant feeling livid...Totto Ramen is one of the exceptions. If I were a more rabble-rousing customer, I would have refused to pay for the garbage that was presented before me. I ask to the fellow patrons, who's 5 star ratings led me to come to Totto in the first place: what were you comparing this to? Packaged ramen???

The fish & Chips was good not great, although I never have had fish served like that, in 3 bunches, home style chips were great. But again the noise here with every patron standing at the bar bellowing to be the loudest loser, this is the major reason that it is doubtful we will be stopping again. Service was amazingly slow considering the number of servers running around & it did take a bit longer to get our meals. During our dinner we noticed multiple couples come in look around & leave, this is a shame because we were looking forward to having a really good \\"step up\\" place to have dinner."},{"name":"Nubian Queen Lola's Cajun Soul Food","address":"1815 Rosewood Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"(This review is from my website and dated 5/29/09.  I am reposting it here because it was one of my best food experiences to date this year and I want to support Lola in her service to the community.)\\n\\nA few months ago, I watched a clip on the television show Texas Country Reporter about this woman, Lola Stephens, who has lived a hard scrabble life. However she got to where she is today, we have to be thankful. Filled with joy, determination, faith in her Lord, and a giving nature, this woman can also cook up one heckuva meal! \\n\\nI walked in and was immediately greeted by someone back in the recesses of the kitchen yelling out that she would be up to help me in just a moment. There were two other customers there, both young men dressed in business casual. I also noticed a couple young men at the back door when I was walking up to the building. When I was seated and looking around, I realized that these men were probably homeless and she was providing them with food. She runs the restaurant by herself six days a week and closes on Sunday to the public in order to feed the homeless. Plus she doesn't turn them away during the week when they come to her for a meal. Lola is a wonderwoman!\\n\\nHer menu is jam packed with soul food and Cajun delights. And according to the reviews, her hamburgers are pretty darn tasty too. She told me her special today was crawfish etoufee. How could I say no? I also opted for two truly southern, soul food sides - yams and collard greens. Oh my goodness! Was I in for a treat!\\n\\nServed on a disposable plate with simply a fork and couple disposable napkins, the food was heavenly. The etoufee was creamy and spicy and filled with tasty, tender-chewy morsels of crawfish. The collard greens (which I have had a few times before and never liked) where tangy, a bit vinegar-y, and delicious! It's true that there is a secret to making those edible and she knows the secret! And the yams, oh-so-sweet and tender. It also came with a moist square of cornbread and I opted for the \\"Cajun\\" Iced tea which was a sugary-sweet beverage with what tasted to me like orange kool-aid mixed in. Surprisingly good and refreshing!\\n\\nThe surroundings are kitschy and certainly suit the proprietor. Filled with painted canvases of President Obama, some statuary, lots of bits and pieces or paper taped and tacked to the walls, even handwritten messages marked directly on the walls, with mardi gras beads hanging from the ceiling, it felt like you were looking through Lola's eyes at how colorful and bright the world really is.\\n\\nI, personally, am looking forward to the next time I get to trek through Austin because I know where I want to eat.  \\n\\nI recommend everyone should check out Nubian Queen' Lola's for good food, good conversation, and good energy."},{"name":"Canal Wigwam","address":"4 S High St","city":"Canal Winchester","stars":"4","text":"Great small town diner.

When we arrived, there was our table set for 6 right next to the front door.  We made it work, had more places set up and got some more chairs.  It was funny because our waiter wanted to take the table next to us and combine it but the hostess had a reservation for 2 coming in and didn't want to make them wait...cause you know, our party of 10 was worthless right?  So we saw their heated discussion right in front of us which was comical...the waiter moved the table over (and the table was 2 inches higher than our other table which just looked funny) then the hostess came over to have them remove it.  Not to mention....after we were already seated for 30 minutes, that same hostess asked one of our ladies to swap out her chair, the nice dark wood and suede cushion with one that you could tell it was a ghetto extra chair which 90% of our table had.  So I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought she was trying to match another table...NO the table she took it to had 2 of the nice chairs and one ghetto chair.  WHAT THE? REALLY? This hostess treated us like we were the outcasts at this place and it was just downright unacceptable.  \\n\\nIt seemed that they were on a switching theme of the day because a little bit later, they switched out waiter (even though he was still serving the other tables he was serving before). Our new waitress was sweet but not the brightest, forgetting some items and messing up some orders.  One lady ordered scrambled eggs and they came out another way and the waitress said \\"Do you mind scooting them onto your smaller plate and I will bring you out scrambled.\\" WHAT? WHO SAYS THAT? YES, SHE SAID SCOOT!  uggg we were just appalled and surprised.  She got the hint and said let me take the plate and I will fix it for you.   Sigh...how hard was that waitress? Should have said that to begin with.  THEN....we simply asked for salt and pepper and it took them forever (we asked 3 different people) and it appeared that out of the 8 tables in this dinning room all tables were sharing 3 sets - sharing? This establishment has a HUGE backroom that was not even being used and there was an upstairs (having a bridal shower) and you are telling me you don't have enough salt and pepper shakers?  We asked the table behind us ourselves.  \\n\\nThere was this random guy (assuming he was a server) and his name was \\"Count\\" and came over wanting to take our photo for us.  Then I asked for a drink menu and he gladly provided us with one.  When the server returned I asked for a drink and the menu was immediately GRABBED from my hand saying that menu was old and I could not order from it.  OOOOKKKK Well then why did the \\"Count\\" deliver it to me? So he said we don't have a lot of mixers that are listed in there but whatever I wanted he could see if they could make.  So, I asked for the menu back to show him what I wanted and he paused and said the prices were not correct.  I said that is fine can I just show you what I want? It was like pulling teeth and I don't care if you are at KFC...ordering should NOT be like pulling teeth!!!!!!\\n\\nI am sure there are MANY things I am forgetting because there were so many issues with this place on this certain morning that it was comical to no end!\\n\\nAs I mentioned...this brunch came with a complimentary mimosa. Yet, when we got our bills we were being charged for it. After arguing with the waitress she finally took it off but was seriously the last thing I even felt like dealing with.\\n\\nWe talked to the manager. He knew every single issue we had and his excuses were \\"they were short staffed,\\" \\"it's a holiday weekend,\\" \\"blah blah blah.\\" I don't want to hear your excuses. I'm paying you money for a service and you failed, just apologize!!!!!  Sigh...so he gave us a bottle of champagne and 5 (yes there were 10 of us) cards for a free glass of wine on our next visit.\\n\\nJust being treated as lousy as we were frustrates me to no end.

It was a most pleasant experience.\\n\\nWe started off with cocktails.  I ordered the 1771 with cardamom and rhubarb and it was one of the top two cocktails I've ever had (the other being from Wildwood in Portland, OR).  The bf got a Coastal Cooler with blueberries, lavender, and lemon.  And let me say *thank you*, Craigie, for providing a spoon for his drink.  Delicious liquor soaked blueberries *should* be eaten but many establishments would unfortunately look down on fishing them out of the glass with a spoon.\\n\\nWe both got the prix fixe menu.  It's a good deal, (especially as you can order anything from the menu for your courses rather than a select few dishes) but in the future I will order less and enjoy it more.  While everything was good, both of us ended up enjoying our appetizers the best.  The amuse bouches were tasty, but not mind blowing.  His was fish something (the better of the two) and mine was prok something.  For appetizers he got the plate of terrines which were well chosen and tasty (and I'm not generally a huge fan) which came wit hsome very good toast (which he ate too much of and got too full-- beware!).  I got the house smoked wild king salmon sald with, among other things, lily bulbs.  It was amazing.  So simply, yet flavorful, clean, light-yet-filling, just perfect.  I would really go back and have this as my main course, possibly with a side.\\n\\nFor our entrees we both got the pork two ways.  The portions were small, but really didn't need to be any bigger.  It was very, very rich (especially after our previous courses)-- almost too rich to be enitrely enjoyable (it was very good, just a bit overwhelming!).\\n\\nFor desert I had the cornbread pain perdu.  It was tasty, but not extraordinary.  The bf had the three fruits sorbet which was refreshing and better than it sounded on the menu.\\n\\nThe service was very nice, no complaints there.  The decor is fine, but not that special (the building itself is average), though the lighting is nice.  It is definitely a good special occassion restaurant, but now I'd really like to go back jsut for a nice evening out when I'll be less tempted to over-indulge!"},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've had my fair share of Italian food in my life and this place unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations.

We both ordered the Cajun iced tea, which is very refreshing, and the shrimp dinner which came with 5 HUGE fried shrimp and two sides.\\n\\nThe shrimp were breaded and cooked to perfection, so succulent and fresh. The collard greens had amazing depth of flavor and her cornbread was out of this world. The side of yams was a sauce kind of mixture that had brown sugar, butter, and diced yams.

The traffic in Little 5 was a mess and finding parking was even worse. After parking in the $7 for all day parking, we noticed the private lot behind the Porter Beer Bar. Which was free. Wish that it could have been advertised better...\\n\\nAfter peering through the closed Criminal Records door, we squeezed our way inside the packed Porter. There was a 25 minute wait that did NOT feel like 25 minutes. We were backed against a wall, standing between the bar and the wall but trying to leave a walkway in between, for what felt like an hour. It was a little frustrating that the waiting area was non-existent, especially when a wait was inevitable. Part of me wanted to just peace out and settle in at the Vortex down the street but I had wanted to try the food here for so long I planted my feet in, and ordered a New Belgium Snapshot (very good by the way, made the wait slightly more bearable) at the bar, although it was just as hard getting the attention of a bartender. \\n\\nShortly after receiving my beer we were directed to a seat. The seating was a little crowded but not so bad. It was a relief finally being seated after such an uncomfortable wait, so I tried to block out the waiting experience so I could appreciate the rest of the night. Unfortunately, service-wise, it didn't get much better. It took a while for our server to get around to us but he eventually came around and took our orders after making a couple of suggestions.\\n\\nWe ordered the \\"Georgia Red Clay\\" as a starter (apparently a daily special), which was a BBQ fois gras, with some bread on the side to spread it on. The spread was phenomenal, although the BBQ overwhelmed the flavor of the fois gras. But because of that chocolate kick (really, chocolate?!) it really blended the odd mixture of flavors together. Perfection, really. Wish the appetizer came with more of it!\\n\\nOur main entrees were the Fish n' Chips and the Porter's Half Pound Cheeseburger with a side of Mac n' Cheese. The fish n' chips were cooked to perfection, flaky and crispy at the same time, as it should be. The burger was meaty, and placed on an asiago bun. It looked EXTREMELY unhealthy but was so good! The mac n cheese was cheesy and not too salty. \\n\\nThe wait to get another drink order and our checks was a good 10-15 minutes after finishing our food... I understand it was a busy night, but it seemed we would have to dramatically wave down our server to get his attention. I'll definitely need to make it out again on a slower night... but yes.

I was in for dinner recently: the braised chicken was terribly dry, the tagliatelle with pork ragu was also dry and under sauced. And to make matters worse, we were blessed with the not-nice server. I wish we could have leaped over tables to get to the nice one but that's not the done thing. When our server came to the table and asked how everything was, I was polite but frank, as is my custom. (Why ask me the question if you don't want a candid answer?) Also, any business, especially a restaurant that hopes to build and keep a dedicated clientele, would want constructive, honest feedback, I think. This server did not. Even though she offered to get me something else, she was haughty and did not contain her disdain. I wish that people in the service industry who don't particularly enjoy people or restaurants would find some other work path. There are plenty of wonderful, warm and friendly, and attentive individuals in the restaurant industry, just not enough of them, unfortunately.

She came by several times over the course of the meal just to chat and refill waters, and make sure everything was OK and tasted great. Exceptional service and a wonderful lady.\\n\\nWe ordered the cheese rolls to start. It came with a syrupy sweet chili sauce that was more sweet than spicy. Nonetheless, the combination was fantastic. Despite being deep fried, the rolls weren't greasy at all, just crispy, hot and light. I ordered the Panang Curry for my entree. I asked for medium spicy, but I didn't feel like it was spicy at all. I could feel a little bit of a kick, but it felt more like mild to me. Next time, I'll ask for more spice. The curry was on the thin side, not overly rich and had great flavor. It came with slices of chicken breast, red and green peppers and sliced zucchini, served with white rice. Simple and delicious. The boyfriend ordered chicken Pad Thai. The noodles had a great texture to them. The dish overall was a little on the sweet side -- I don't think I've tasted Pad Thai that sweet. But it was really good and I would order it for myself next time. He also asked for medium spicy and found it severely lacking in the spice department. Chai brought over a selection of chili (sambal and a chili powder concoction) for him when he asked, though.\\n\\nThe decor of this place is very plain. The menu says that the restaurant has been in business 44 years (but Chai mentioned it was opened in 1977, so not sure which is correct). The \\"oldness\\" of the restaurant shows. Don't worry, it's not falling apart or anything, though the outside of the building looks rather dingy. The inside is pretty sterile-looking with white walls and no-fuss tables and chairs, though they have white tablecloths and some minor decorations on the walls.\\n\\nI'm sure this place gets a lot of regulars. A young-ish looking guy came in by himself after us and Chai chatted with him a while. It seemed like they knew each other well enough that he must come here often. She mentioned that they will name certain dishes after people if they keep ordering them (one of the specials was Mr. David's Mango Chicken).\\n\\nShe even walked us out to the car afterwards, asking our names (oops, we didn't introduce ourselves at the beginning) and shaking our hands.\\n\\nOverall, it was a great dinner and definitely plan on coming back."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have no idea how this place got decent reviews.

Upon entering we encountered a large number of Asian patrons, which usually signals some manner of authenticity, but the Chinese food was just shy of the kind of offerings that you find in a mall food court (perhaps frugality trumps authenticity).  \\n\\nThe Egg Drop Soup, for example, was exceedingly thick--I found it difficult to eat.  My Mongolian BBQ sampling lacked an array of sauces, so following cooking, I received a strange, tart, salty coating to the pork and vegetable mash I put together.  \\n\\nIn addition to some of the more common items you'd find at a Chinese buffet, I found fried plantains and a cheese pizza; next to the sushi platter, fresh fruit, banana pudding, and cookies; and oddly enough, the ice cream machine was right next to the Mongolian BBQ raw meat selection.  And pretty much everything was topped with a layer of the kind of grease you find at years-old Waffle Houses. \\n\\nNot everything was bad, note--I did eat my fill, and the prices (including the coupon we found in the monthly tourist rag) are pretty good for the amount of food that I ate.  I suppose I could say that NYCB appropriately rounded out my tourist experience for excess."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pros: authentic, fun, unique vibe of a restaurant that stays true to its Cuban roots.

Pizza and salad go hand in hand in my opinion. I hate ordering from the national chains and prefer to go local, but it's pretty hard to do that in my hood. Austin's has been a fail  and it's too $$ on too many occasions, so I often opt for the chain pizza when I'm feeling a lazy pajama Sunday coming on.

They have some interesting options that sound good. Sounds like a win win, right? Wrong. Their salads are either old and wilty (one of the reasons it's been awhile since I've ordered from them), or like today's version of a Caesar that consisted of romaine, AN ENTIRE CANISTER of Kraft Parmesan Powdered Cheese, and some sad, store bought croutons. It was indelible! The haole pizza was really good as were the Torpedo pizza rolls we ordered. Salad, gross! I called and complained and they quickly put a refund on my card, although no question about what was wrong with it. So, this could happen again. Sad, because they used to be my fave and had awesome, fresh ingredients when I first moved to Austin ten years ago and lived in the '04. Maybe it's just this location? In the past their wings have been awful too. Just go for the pizza related items and this is a win, better than any national chain.

I work long hours during the week so 9pm on a Friday feels like making a reservation at 2am and thinking I'll still have energy for a drink afterward.)--- which to me was a good sign.  If so many people want to book the restaurant, I'll take a reservation when I can get it!  I wasn't disappointed.  Here's the thing about their RW menu:  It does what it's supposed to do.  Every course gave me an idea of what this restaurant was capable of serving to me if I came back on a regular week for the regular menu.  The appetizer-- yes, it was small, but it was meant to be.  I got the mozzarella appetizer, which was delicious.  I was surprised to see that one of the two kinds of tomatoes on the plate wasn't quite ripe, but the cheese made up for it to me.  My boyfriend had the Insalata del Mar, and I agree with a previous reviewer that the squid was a little tough, and all around it wasn't my favorite appetizer.\\n\\nFor the next course, I can tell you that between the spinach and feta pillows (I forget the Italian name for these, but the description was calling them pillow-like pasta) and the bolognese dish, you CAN'T GO WRONG.  These were literally the most amazing pasta dishes I've ever eaten.  Based on these dishes alone I would go back to this restaurant.  (So like I said, this RW menu did what it was supposed to do!)  The bolognese was amazing and the pasta was cooked perfectly, but I have to say, the pillow pasta was something spectacular that I would order over and over again.  However, upon just conferring with my bf, he says the same of the bolognese!  \\n\\nFor the main course we had the lamb and the trout.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his trout and thought that it was fresh and salty and fishy-- just what he wanted.  The lamb was good to me, but I was starting to get full, so I passed it over to him (yes, he finished it as well, without complaining!).  I could have over-stuffed myself, but if I were going to do it, I would have done it on that pasta!  Both main dishes were good and filling, but I have to say that they wouldn't be why I would go back to this restaurant.  Without a doubt, I would go back to Terramia a few times a year for the appetizers, the wine, and a huge plate of pasta!  Delicious.  Fantastic RW menu that let me get a taste of everything the place was capable of, and now I know exactly what I would come back for!  Please have no second thoughts about booking this place for RW, or for their regular menu.  \\n\\n(Btw, in response to a past reviewers comment that portion sizes aren't big enough-- my boyfriend and I are both not light eaters.  I left completely full after an appetizer, a second dish, and a few bites of my main course, and he left near to bursting after finshing both mine and his.  I have absolutely no complaints about the portion size for the $33 price tag.)"},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I visited Boston this summer for the first time, and dining at The Salty Pig is what I keep reminiscing about two months later.

My friend also ordered bruschetta as an appetizer for the 3 of us. It came as 2 thick french bread style slices which I had to cut up to split between the 3 of us.

I actually started a countdown the week we were going because I was so excited.  \\n\\nOur reservation was for 9PM and it was still bumping in there!  I liked looking into the kitchen and seeing everybody bustling around and preparing the plates.  To my dismay, we were led around the corner to a table right next to the kitchen door.

There were no other tables available at that moment, so there we sat.\\n\\nService was mostly good and like others have mentioned, all of the waitstaff pitches in.  Our \\"main\\" waiter was an older gentleman and I felt uncomfortable asking him anything - it was almost like he was too busy to take much time with us unless we absolutely needed it and when I saw him laughing and joking with other tables around us, it made me wonder what the deal was.  This really bothered me.  It was a very awkward dynamic.  \\n\\nWe got the prix fixe menu and I started with the octopus, and my bf had the Maine clams.  Both were delicious and cooked to perfection.  The octopus took me back to my year spent working in Spain.  For our mains, bf chose the rib eye, and I had the pork three ways.  I wasn't crazy about my dish due to the suckling confit and the rib being a little dry, but I tried a few bites of the rib eye and it was everything you want a steak to be.  For dessert I got the sorbets and I loved the grapefruit, felt ambivalent about the mango, and was slightly repulsed by the yogurt flavored option.  The bf was very happy with his choice of the malted milk parfait.  \\n\\nAt the start of the meal I had wanted a glass of wine.  Not being familiar with the whites being offered by the glass, I asked our waiter for his recommendation.  He seemed confused by this and asked me what kind of wine I usually liked.  I said I wanted something slightly sweet and crisp.  Apparently this was not enough information, so I said that I generally enjoy most Rieslings.  I felt kind of stupid at this point.  He offered to bring a half bottle of Riesling.  I really only wanted a glass, but bf said he would partake in a glass of wine as well so we went along with it.\\n\\nI didn't notice until the next day, but I thought that the bill was a lot higher than I had expected.  I asked my bf to see the receipt and discovered that we were served a $60 half bottle of wine.  My bf told me not to worry about it, but I was upset.  Presumably if somebody asks for a glass of wine then they are not looking to spend that much on a half bottle, especially when there are full bottles of Riesling on the wine list that are within the same price range.  It's just another way that our waiter came off as careless about our visit.\\n\\nI was really hoping for a special night and this fell short.

On a particularly loud night peak decibels were well over 90. I showed that to a server who became annoyed and walked away. Also, we recently went there and faced an unusually long delay -- 45 minutes from our first serving of focaccia and wine before we got our entrees and sides.

The atmosphere of the new location is a mix of rustic urban chic; very cool vibe.\\n\\nOn our first visit we tried the \\"chef's experience\\" -  8 courses or so - and it was even more amazing than I remember the experience before. Maybe it's the fact that we were practically sitting in the kitchen, on top of the chefs as they prepared every morsel, or maybe it was the fact that the chef-owner, Tony Maws, takes the time to come over and explain almost every dish, but the flavors that were in these dishes were just indescribably overwhelming -  gastronomy at it's best.\\n\\nLast night the three of us sat in the lounge and ordered hamburgers. I really think Craigie should come up with a different name for these things because \\"hamburger\\" just sounds vulgar when trying to describe this amazingly  delicious dish. Cooked to perfection, just the right size, ideal accompaniments, flavor flavor flavor: wow.  We each started with a different starter - they were all just as delicious. \\n\\nOh and the cocktails Craigie serves up now - damn. Tom, the beverage manager, is an expert mixologist and since Craigie is focusing on pre-prohibition era cocktails, it might require a slight adjustment from what your normal cocktail palate, but put your trust in Tom and you won't be disappointed.

I've always loved it and really liked bringing friends from out of town here because it really is a world class beer bar. If I were writing a review on the beer service and selection this would easily be a no-brainer five star review.\\n\\nThe reason this is a two star review is due to the food. In past 3 or 4 trips I have experienced a troubling trend. This is a beer bar. So why in the world would you have ramen on the menu? Or tuna tartar? Or even calamari if you are only going to half-ass those menu items? \\n\\nMost recently I went with the hubs before a show at the Variety playhouse. Got two beers (excellent beers, great price, these guys have it down to an art) and perused the menu. \\n\\nI was drawn into the tractor beam of the pork belly ramen for 11 bucks. What can I say my curiosity got the best of me. Hubs went for what one would expect to be the safer bet- 9 dollar calamari app. \\n\\nMy ramen was a disappointing portion size with the main flavor profile being 'salt'. The noodles were very chewy and not quite cooked all the way. Maybe they were par-cooked and the line cook forgot to finish them off? There was no depth or sophistication to the broth and it was cloyingly oily, but the pork belly did have a nice char on it even if it was- you guessed it- overly salty. The best thing about the bowl was the pickled egg. For 11 bucks this was halfhearted and poorly executed attempt at a trendy food item. I wasn't expecting expert level ramen, but I do better at home. \\n\\nHubs' calamari was no better. First, this was not just calamari. It included battered and fried jalapenos and also battered and fried lemon slices- rind and all- that were bitter and off putting. I'm sure someone is justifying this as innovation but it's just bad. I could even get behind these as a garnish or accompaniment but these non calamari items constituted a LARGE part of a 9 dollar calamari dish. Probably a third fried jalapeno, a third fried lemon and a third calamari. Not cool. This was also served in a basket instead of plated so after 4 minutes or so all the pieces on the bottom were soggy and saturated in grease. Gross. \\n\\nI feel like these dishes sum up perfectly what had been happening the other times I have eaten here but couldn't put my finger on it. This place should not get an identity crisis and try to be trendy or innovate in the kitchen. They don't have the chops for it and it's a mess.

Tons of shrimp, lightly breaded and it was hard not to eat their leftovers.  My only recommendation would be to request the main dining area so you can watch the dancing.  The dancers did come to the back room and invited our kids to dance, so we really can't complain.  All in all, a wonderful evening."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Why hello there, Italian-style pizza. You were so tasty that 20 of us demolished five of you in under a few minutes. Nom nom indeed.\\n\\nBeen wanting to try this spot for awhile but also enjoy not being crammed into a tiny dining area, I took this experience to go out to the park. I also wanted to test the pizza consistency after a period... passed on all accounts. Granted it was only 15 minutes before it was consumed, but it was still warm and gooey and crispy all at the same time. They allowed me to order 4 pizzas max for take out and were very quick about finishing them up in the oven when we arrived to pick them up. I liked that touch. That means they don't make your pizza and let it sit there until you can get it; they tell you come when you can, hand over the order number, we finish firing the pizza and give it to you hot and fresh out of the oven.\\n\\nI only tried some of the toppings that fell off of one pizza and had a large slice of the bianca and both were incredible. Tons of flavor, not greasy at all, and certainly delicious. I was impressed. I'd love to come back and try another pie, but that white pizza... I don't know if I can stray from it. That's like telling you dog you can't love it anymore because you want to try out a new dog in the house instead...\\n\\nOverall, 4.5 stars. I am only unimpressed by the lack of proper hours posted on the website (it's NOON on the weekends - not 11:30!) and that you can only order 4 pizzas to-go max, something also not stated on the website.

While we did not get the pollo a la brasa which may have been a mistake, my Peruvian-born wife did not like the empanadas because they were not Peruvian-style and had rice inside (I thought they were decent) and she didn't like the arroz chaufa de carne, which is a Peruvian thing, because it didn't taste like the real deal. That being said, I thought the fried rice was really good despite tasting a little different that what I've had before. We both had a sopa de polla (chicken soup) and agreed it was tasty as well.  \\n\\nService was nice and attentive. Prices were good. $10 for a massive portion of beef fried rice with plantains. $2.50 for a nice size cup of soup with chicken, potatoes and veggies. Inca Kola $2 and they have Cusquena beer.

The Fall Fashion is a delicious blend of aged bourbon with spices, both strong and sweet.

You can also order from a more regular stable of items, such as starters, pastas, entrees, etc...\\n\\nFor starters, their calamari and garlic knots were really good. The breaded calamari was fried lightly on the outside, giving it a crunchy exterior. The garlic knots were extremely fresh, and the warm soft interior meshed well with the crispy outside. The house garlic sauce was also extremely flavorful.\\n\\nA few of my friends got their pizzas, which were absolutely massive. A single pizza is definitely shareable between two people. They also allow you to do half and half. The peperonata (spicy sausage, goat cheese, fresh oregano) looked fantastic. \\n\\nI got their lamb shoulder, which was roasted tender with artichokes and greens. It's cooked in a coratella style, which means the internal organs of the lamb are also included. I thought the lamb was juicy and flavorful, though wish they had a more robust sauce. Some au jus would have further enhanced the flavors.  \\n\\nFor the mix & match plates, you can choose between a type of meat (the prochetta and prosciutto are my favorite), a type of cheese (I recommend the manchego) and a small side dish. \\n\\nThe prices were extremely fair, with most dishes around $10-15, which is a steal for this place. \\n\\nIf you want a laidback atmosphere while enjoying some high-quality food, The Salty Pig will be your answer."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've enjoyed a lot of great drafts at The Porter, and I generally appreciate the gritty pub atmosphere, but at almost every turn I've found the food underwhelming.  For these elevated prices you're much better off eating at a legit restaurant and then stopping by this BAR for a postprandial quaff. \\n\\nOur latest visit saw more of the same.  The calamari was just bad.  To start it was served in a greasy, soggy pile, stacked all on top of itself in a too small fry basket.  I've recently enjoyed much, much better calamari plates at nearby Agave and Doc Cheys.  Both of those places understand that Calamari should be served spread out on a large plate so as to retain its crispiness.  The aioli was blah, and paled in comparison to the sublime jalapeno jelly at Agave.  Lastly, the fried lemon that was mixed in and difficult to distinguish from the squid was a dish wrecker; the rind was overwhelmingly bitter and just threw everything off. \\n\\nMy lady had the ramen special and pegged it as a failed and unfortunate experiment from the culinary hacks that apparently run things in the back.  It was greasy, muddled, and the pork belly was just off.  This one was not ready for prime time and never should have left the kitchen.  \\n\\nI thought her assessment was harsh until I really thought back and realized, outside of their laudable french fries, I've never had a truly good bite of food here in five years and at least as many trips.  Why the hell do I keep coming back to pick up a fork when I should really stick to raising glasses?  That's a question I won't have to ask myself again because I'm done picking up The Porter's menu. \\n\\nI really do like the vibe, the location is killer, and I appreciate The Porter being one of the leading beer mecca's in the region--but that's where it ends for me.

Generally you expect a few rough edges (and there were), but you get a real good feel for what they're about.  And this place is all about the food.\\n\\nOur group ordered three dishes, the Pasta Argentine, Sopa Azteca, and a Ceasar salad.  The salad was the only dish that was a disappointment.  The person who got it (not me) didn't care for the dressing, and they certainly could have used better lettuce in it.  It had good presentation, and I can't personally speak to the dressing, but for the price (almost $10) I would have expected it to be punched up a little bit more.\\n\\nThe Pasta Argentine was fantastic, and I'm not a pasta fan.  This is genuine hand made pasta (or the best darn impression I've ever seen of it), with a nice tomato sauce and sliced sausage substituting for the meatballs.  The Mrs told me she was in the mood for Italian and Mexican, this dish delivered on both cravings.\\n\\nThe Sopa Azteca was amazing.  This is a traditional soup I've only had south of the border.  I have a recipe and have made it myself, so I know how much work can go into a simple bowl of soup.  It was topped off with some chicharrones, which were incredibly light and fluffy (seriously some of the best I've ever had).\\n\\nThe portion size I thought was perfect.  Everyone cleared their plate but not a single person went away hungry.  Too many places serve huge portions that you either end up splitting or taking home.  My only \\"complaint\\" was the total price, and that's mostly my own fault for making the assumption that a place with Cantina in the name would be cheap.  Don't get me wrong, the food was worth every penny, but it's a little too expensive for a place I would make a regular stop.\\n\\nSpeaking of the bill, our server dropped the Ceasar Salad off the bill (without any requesting on my part).  If I could add another star for that, I would.  The total bill came to $68, broken down it was 3 orders of Pasta Argentine, 1 Sopa Azteca, a side of guacamole, a side of beans and rice, two soda's, and a juice.  We had a party of four and a half (a little one who ate the beans and rice, and had the juice), so it works out to around $15 a person.\\n\\nSo far this is by far the best Central/South American restaurant I've eaten at in the Portland area.

All things considered, dinner was good, the food was good, the drinks were good, and the service and the ambiance were okay. We had a pizza and the gnocchi. Both were good (hot and as the menu described, but maybe a little under seasoned for my taste). My cocktail was good, but the water refills were a little slow coming. The bread and the white bean compote that started us off were very good. Not too much garlic, but still lots of flavor. \\n\\nWhere Antico lost me was the ambiance of the restaurant. We were jammed in there like sardines. I wasn't expecting to have a private conversation, but there were 4 inches between the table next to us on the left and 6 inches between us and the table on the right. Clearly, we all could hear what we all were saying. I would rather have waited a few minutes for a different table. What really confused me was that when the concierge called for an 8pm reservation, they told him that they were overbooked at 8, but that they would see us at 830. So we showed up at 830 and were put in-between 2 other couples on dates. My last comment will be about the service, it was a little lacking. No one checked back to see how things were after the food was dropped. We sat after we were done eating for about 10 minutes before someone offered to wrap up the rest of our meals. Someone other than our waitress dropped the check and we finally saw her again at the end as we were putting on our coats. \\n\\nThe food was good, and to be fair, I didn't want to go to a place that was super spendy.

It was both burned (perhaps from sitting in that damnable oven for an extra half hour) and soggy. This combination of factors is a curious one, but rest assured it is far from pleasant. The color of the cheese was also a mysterious dark orange. We're not talking the pepperoni-tinged mozzarella orange that fans of cheap eats pizza are familiar with.

My idea of a quality dining experience is not waiting out in the cold for an undetermined amount of time and then being squeezed into an unbelievably tight space and literally rubbing elbows with your neighbor diners. For a place that serves $15-26 dishes, I shouldn't have to read the menu off the *wall* or on stained and/or sloppy hand-written menu. For a bottle of wine priced at $20-something, I shouldn't see a fourth of a cup of wine splashed on the table after the waitress dumps the wine into my glass (although at least she had my friend try the wine before she poured the other glasses... although I doubt if \\"Try this\\", spoken in a surly tone, is the traditional way of presenting a wine to a patron). When expecting to have a bill of about $100, I shouldn't have a waitstaff that can hardly, well, wait for you to make up your mind about the menu. And after all that... the long wait, the hurried meal, the humorless waitress... my friend got food poisoning from what we figure must have been the scallops. But really... in hindsight I guess that's not so surprising.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I don't want to completely sully the Giacomo name-- I love the South End location (the experience is the opposite of what exists in the North End).\\n\\nDon't waste your time going to Giacomo's North End.

Unfortunately, not even one patio was smoke-free. Why is it that with three patios, a non-smoker has to eat inside or eat while breathing in second-hand smoke?\\nOne of the back patios was empty so we asked to be seated out there. There was live music up front so, even though we couldn't enjoy that, we figured everyone else would want to sit up there. We were seated in back but were told that people may come out there and smoke. I don't know why they couldn't just ask people not to smoke in this small section.  Two other groups sat in back with us; non-smokers (one had a dog) so I thought we may be able to enjoy our food and this beautiful night. \\nUnfortunately, that didn't last very long as smokers soon made their way near us and we were forced to breath second-hand smoke while we ate :(\\nThe food was ok. We had the pretzel nuggets with mustard and cheese. The outside seemed fried (which is odd) but inside was soft. They were ok but we didn't like them enough to finish them. \\nMy husband ordered the Legend sandwich; which he didn't finish because \\"it wasn't spectacular\\". \\nI had the fish and chips with sweet potato fries. The fish was pretty good - except the larger piece that was not cooked all the way (which I, unfortunately, didn't find out until I had taken a big bite of it).

I asked the waitress about this and she asked her manager; but no, the bill was correct (not right but correct). If they were going to charge me full price then they SHOULD have given me the regular fries as well that were supposed to come with the meal. \\nSandwich up charge was $1.49 for fries and $1.99 for sweet fries; so I assumed that I would be charged $0.50 for substituting sweet for regular fries. Crazy me for thinking logically. \\nI feel ripped off because I was charge for a side order and didn't get the meal I paid for. \\nThe service was good but not great.

That actually just about sums up the rest of this review.\\n\\nI can't recall my first visit to a Ruth's Chris restaurant, but it might have been San Diego in the late 90's.  I go whenever I've traveling to a new city if they have a location, I've been to at least 9 including Boston.  I even went to Connecticut just to go to Ruth's Chris before Boston and Providence opened.  I've been to the Boston location about six times.  So yeah, I'm a bit of a fanboy.\\n\\nIt is pricey, it's not the kind of place I go to often, I probably average once every 9 months or so.  It's a treat, and my favorite higher end restaurant.  I usually get the T-Bone if I have the room, but I've had the strip, filet, and ribeye as well.  To me, the flavoring of the steak is unbeatable.  I like the whole presentation as well, when it comes over on an extremely hot plate still sizzling from the grill.\\n\\nI also get some shared potato and vegetable sides and end with berries in cream sauce.  Everyone that I've ever brought has thoroughly enjoyed their meals, even someone that ordered tuna steak.\\n\\nI like the atmosphere as well.  In Boston I've eaten downstairs a few times, and in the bar area a few times.  The bar area is generally more casual and the times that I've gone it's been much less crowded.  The dining area is busier, but still generally quiet and relaxed.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a great night out, give them a try."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Just simply fantastic!  Went there the night after we went to Mama Maria's and, although we give MM its due, Giacomo just blows it away - first on the food and second on the charm and for a third of the price..  \\n\\nCutting to the chase - we ordered the calamari appetizer - it was best of breed with ideal spicy tomato dipping sauce - and still, the worst thing we ordered.  I had the fusili with lobster and shrimp in spicy tomato sauce.  The pasta is clearly homemade fresh, perfect al dente - maybe best fusili I ever had.  Sauce - excellente and fresh.  Lobster was a tad chewy though but the homemade fresh flavor was awesome.  My fiancee asked the waiter what to choose between the lobster ravioli and the special ravioli - which was hot coppacola filling with dabs of goat cheese on top of amazing tomato chicken sauce.  The waiter said - \\"you can get lobster ravioli anywhere\\" - yeah right! - but steered us toward the special.  And special indeed it was - best ravioli dish on the planet - and that includes the planet Italy.\\n\\nEverything served piping hot right from the pot to the table.  All of this for a shockingly moderate price, including a very solid bottle of Montepulciano and we were out of there for $63.  I ended up leaving the biggest tip of my life (percentage wise).  Did I mention the large portions?  Really - read my other reviews and you will see that I am not easily impressed, but this place is special.

When I arrived at the take-out counter, I nearly fell over from the shock: $21 for  a large chicken margarita pizza? Are you kidding me?  Yes, it was delectable with just the right amount of fresh mozzarella blobs. However, one would think gold would be sprinkled on top of the pie at that price.

I ordered the eggs christopher, basically an eggs beniedict done j christopher style which wasnt much different that the original, but still very tasty.  The holandaise was not broken and was flavorful, needed a touch more lemon though, the egg was poached nice, cooked on the outside and nice and runny on the inside, the bacon was crispy and the english muffin soft.

The pictures and the reviews looked so promising!  I realize that for a lot of coffee shops, the high ratings usually mainly come from their locations, which was conveniently right by the marina in this case, and there being free wifi and ample outlets, which this place did have, rather than the quality of the coffee.  But the pictures showed that there would be a nice view outside overlooking the river and also some nice latte art that I was willing to try the place.\\n\\nI got there later than I expected, so I was going to give it a free pass on the view and just believe the pictures.  When I first set foot in the door, it looked promising.  Nice wooden architecture, lots of people hanging around, either working or socializing, and also a nice variety of food and desserts.  After I got the cappuccino though, that was when it went all sorts of wrong.\\n\\nThere was no latte art - I know this sounds totally snobby but I was expecting it just because the pictures had them.  It would have been okay as long as the coffee tasted good, but that was not the case...  Instead, it was super foamy, like 85% foam.  It took forever and almost vertical tilt of the mug to actually get to the espresso, which was just meh.  Because the mug was mostly foam, it took me less than five sips to finish it.  My friend got the caf√© au lait, which turned out to be watered down coffee milk.  It wasn't that the coffee to milk ratio was wrong or that there was too much milk.  It was just that the espresso itself tasted like watered down brewed coffee.  We couldn't even bring ourselves to finish it.\\n\\nWe just left disappointed, and on our way to another coffee house to make up for it.

Very good prices on wine available by the bottle. The restaurant is known for their Italian style seafood dishes - choose your sauce, choose your seafood, comes over linguine.

I would only marginally place the taste of the food above your average Rudy's or Bill Miller's-on second thought Bill Miller's is BAE. The sauce wasn't anything special either and I found myself using their notably dry bread to get rid of its slightly overwhelming after taste. The sides were equally bland and paled in comparison to those of other restaurants. The beans were terribly sweet. The potato salad was basic. And the small dollop of cole slaw was more shredded cabbage than slaw. To the restaurant's credit, I did eat all the food. But I'm a growing boy that eats everything. \\nUltimately, the best part of my experience was the Tardis... and Riri but I took him with me.

Like, a huge pit over a flame where they keep all their smoked delights warm until you are ready to order. And it smells....ahmazing. If you're a die hard carnivore and that doesn't make you want to run out the door and get in line then IDK what's wrong with you. \\n\\nNow, let's start from the beginning. I rolled into Austin to visit some friends with zero agenda. Well, no, that's not true. I said, \\"I don't care what else we do as long as I get some bomb ass Texas BBQ.\\" They decided to bring me here. I was not disappointed.\\n\\nI've been told that there are better places for the actual BBQ, but the overall ambiance and the trip into the country kind of make this place. And it's true. Rolling up I was impressed--this is a COMPLEX. Two huge dining areas with one waiting area in the middle. The amount of cars in the parking lot freaked me out. \\"Oh my God, we're never going to eat are we?\\" I thought to myself after our 30 minute drive out there. But I was mistaken. The crowds are overwhelming but the Salt Lick does everything in their power to move things along. \\n\\nFirst off, the waiting area. It's not awkward-standing-in-the-doorway-of-your-favorite-brunch-place kind of waiting. There are picnic tables, live music, and the place is BYOB so you can comfortably drink as you wait for your buzzer to go off. Secondly, because the dining areas are so huge they can seat a lot of people. This makes things move pretty quickly as well. Finally, thanks to the huge meat pit where they keep all the delights, the food comes quickly once you order. It's not made to order. You choose what they have you'll like it. \\n\\nThe menu is simple: a few meats (brisket, ribs, turkey, chicken, and sausage). Your plate comes with the prescribed sides, a German style potato salad (think vinegar, not mayo), baked beans, coleslaw, and bread. The sides? They are not the stars here. In fact, I barely ate mine (although I did love the baked beans to be fair). No, you're here for the meat. \\n\\nI had the 3 meat sampler--brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. This is good. The rub on the brisket is a bit spicy but the sauce has a light sweetness to it that really cuts it. But if you want the spice, though, there is a spicy sauce. No worries there. The rib was meaty, fatty, and fall off the bone good. The sausage had a slight kick but nothing too strong. It might have been my favorite. But as a Polish girl I love an encased meat. Overall it was really good but not knock me off my seat amazing. Meaning, I loved it when I was eating it but I haven't been craving it since my return to the mitten.\\n\\nFor dessert there's cobbler--peach of blackberry. I went peach. My friend went blackberry. He was right. The peach is good but the blackberry has that tartness that contrasts nicely with the ice cream and oats.\\n\\nIn the end we were in and out in about an hour and a half/two hours. Which was much better than I imagined given the crowd. I've been told by friends there's better BBQ in Austin but for a first time experience, to dip my toe in?

It was my birthday. I hadn't been feeling well all day, but I was really looking forward to dinner. By 930pm it seemed like I was on the mend. \\n\\nWhen we were seated at the table, there was a card from Craigie wishing me a Happy Birthday. Our waiter and hostess knew everything about us based on casual questions my husband had asked or mentioned on the phone. Both wished me a happy birthday upon arrival, and our waiter let us know that he knew my husband was a pescetarian and he would talk to the chefs to accommodate. They did, gladly. Again, neither my birthday or my husband's diet were big points when making the reservation. They just paid attention. \\n\\nI've worked in restaurants before, so service is something that often disappoints me when going out to eat. I have never felt so welcomed and taken care as I did last night. \\n\\nWhen our first course arrived I felt instantly revitalized and felt like I was definitely feeling better. 2nd course I still felt ok. Right before the 3rd course I was feeling faint and began shaking. I was picking at this delicious plate of monkfish with yuzu, ginger, and chickpeas and was worrying if I was going to be sick. What to do? I couldn't finish. My husband called over the waiter to let him know that I'd suddenly had a turn for the worse. He was concerned, stopped the courses and brought the hostess over. They just wanted me to be happy, they would do whatever we wanted. Continue with the remaining three courses, trim it down to 4, or we could possibly even come back the following Sunday. I knew that if they brought out the 4th course, I would not be able to eat it, but I really didn't want to leave when we had been treated so wonderfully. Unfortunately, I had to admit that I could not go on. \\n\\nThey re-booked us for this Sunday, they only charged us for our drinks, and continually made us feel that they just wanted the best for us. I was nearly moved to tears.\\n\\nThis was the type of service that I dream about. Kind, knowledgeable, unobtrusive, elegant but welcoming, and with obvious love for food and the experience of dining. Without question the best dining experience I have ever had.

In the two times I've been there, I didn't see an over-whelming number of people reading at the table, probably because the tables are kinda small and won't comfortably fit a book and a plate at the same time.\\n\\nThe food isn't that impressive, but the staff is extremely friendly and the mango tea didn't have that gross bitter after-taste that most packaged teas have.

This is an extremely popular restaurant for groups--the Hibachi, especially. If you happen to go on a Saturday, you may want to bring your earplugs because it's likely you'll hear Happy Birthday songs and drums all evening! Also, reviews tend to be fairly good and maybe you'll be in the favorable camp. \\nHowever, the problem I've had is that I'm missing the authentic taste experience that I truly long for from this place. Primarily, I'm referring to the sushi. Maybe I'm strange, but I prefer not to have every roll drenched in sauce (I always ask to hold the sauce)...Or fried to capacity...Or packed with everything except the kitchen sink. Plus, does every roll have to fall apart before getting off my plate and into my mouth...I realize sushi can be traditionally eaten by hand, but if I choose to eat with chopsticks--it would be awesome if didn't have to look like a novice (which I'm not, lol) Or resort to licking my plate (which is uncouth)--please, help a sister out! \\nLastly, and most importantly, I expect the fish to taste beyond fresh--please. The Hibachi is ok, bordering on possibly good. But, I've had better in less \\"Trendy\\" places, which aren't in the city. The  parking situation can be totally nuts when valet is backed-up and you're stuck on Cheshire Bridge Rd. Prices are a bit on the high side too and service can be inconsistent at times.  Overall, I would go back for a decent meal, but not expecting a great dinner experience. Hope this helps and Happy Eating!"},{"name":"Harvard Gardens","address":"316 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I braved the elements last Saturday morning to dine at Harvard Gardens with some fellow Yelpers for the monthly book club brunch. The conversation and company were impressive--the food unfortunately, not so much.\\n\\nI knew that something was up as soon as I opened up my menu to see nary a mention of French toast or pancakes among my brunch options. Come to think of it, there was a serious lack of simple carb-filled options for a meal which is one of the best excuses out there to carbo-load. What was really messed up was that, going by the other offerings on the menu, the basic ingredients for French toast were clearly lying around the kitchen (eggs, milk, cinnamon, bread, etc.), but there was not one meal that included my favorite brunch staple.\\n\\nSince I hate omelettes and most other egg-centered dishes, I decided to be lame and order a cheeseburger. Bad idea. My cheeseburger ended up being a mean, rather sad-looking affair--a small, dry, and oh-so-tasteless beef patty overwhelmed by a large, stiff bun and topped off with a perfunctory sprinkling of shredded mozzarella. The fries that came with my meal were very good, but not nearly good enough to make up for the hunk of ill-prepared and poorly-outfitted meat on my plate.\\n\\nBetween the menu weirdness and the lackluster food, I doubt that I'll be back at Harvard Gardens on my own dime any time soon."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Authentic Italian pizza.

Unfortunately, it's not, since they will not seat a single customer. The food, while creative, is maybe slightly above average, but, as other reviewers have noted, the attitude of the staff, refusing to seat singles at one of their tables for two (I fully understand if they don't want to use up one of their tables for four for a single patron), has kept me away for the last two years. It's not about waiting, it's about keeping ME waiting on the sole chance that another party of 2 MIGHT show up. Not sure if it's greed, but why should I take my money to a place that doesn't want me there?\\n\\nI still go there from time to time when my kids are in town, and check in every half year or so to see if their practices have changed (they haven't), but otherwise prefer places that appreciate EVERY customer. Joseph's II for instance is only a few blocks down the road, has higher quality food, and they're happy to see (and seat) me every time I go there."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The Good:\\nDELICIOUS food. Per the reviews I got the Managers Special - $9.95, it includes egg, grits (or hashbrowns), bacon (or sausage), and once piece of french toast (or two pancakes). It was hot fresh and wonderful. I don't always like french toast, some places make it dry and unflavorful-- this french toast was GREAT (I'm usually a pancake person). \\n\\nThe Bad:\\nDISORGANIZED. This place was in complete disorder. There was NO greeter. You didn't know who you server was. The wait is insane, I mean I spent hours here (luckily I was in no rush). Checkout was a mess. I felt bad for them. This place has sooo much potential, they just need someone to come in their and tighten ship. On the off chance someone from the business reads this, here's what I would recommend....\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS to The Atlanta Breakfast Club:\\n\\n1. ) Have a designated greeter. Get a little stand from Craigslist or something place it in the center, get a notebook and pens to right down names. Have business cards (not vital) on the stand too. This person could perhaps be paid hourly (minimum wage if that's all you can afford- they just need to be happy/smiling, somewhat articulate, and have general good sense). Give them other complimenting tasks too, that they can do at home. I'd say maybe social media and online presence. They check reviews and answer customer inquiries. Your business is in downtown, pretty much across from the tourist area. Plus your prices are great and you have deals going on, like Scoutmob, this will help manage your place. \\n\\n2. ) Give each waiter/server a designated area. I'd say you can split it up in 4 sections, more if possible. There's 2 main sections (right and left), then just half those.  On the days where you may only have 2 or 3 servers, split up the sections equally, but maybe also according to the speed and efficiency of the particular server. Make sure they stick to their sections and don't jump around too much. \\n\\n3.) Get a the little Square or instant swipe thing for your iPads. I noticed the server had to input my credit card. This isn't anything major at all, just something to possibly consider if it compliments the management system you already have in place. \\n\\n4.) Give the checkout person admin access to the open checks. The person in charge of checkout should be able to closeout checks no matter which tablet/ipad it's open on. \\n\\n5.) Get a restaurant business mentor. Your place is AWESOME, the food is top notch, seriously good.  I was so surprised given the long wait and disorder, but I was so happy to get such great food. I'm sure the current owner knows alot about the business and how to run things, but it's always great to get the expertise of others, especially in business.  I'm sure there's some type of business mentorship in Atlanta specifically for restaurants, most likely free. Then there's the classic route of maybe asking to chat with successful business owners in the area to get some advice every now and then. Successful Atlanta started businesses are Flying Biscuit (they started on Piedmont and 10th, now they have SEVERAL restaurants and is now a franchise in the Southeast), Highland Bakery (Started on Highland Ave, now they're everywhere), Flip Burger, and many more. Le Petit Marche is a breakfast/lunch spot in Kirkwood that's also delicious, they started small and now have a new spot across the street. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and ask for help and advice... it will pay off in the long run. \\n\\n6.) Consider Cash Only. If needed you guys could take the Thumbs Up approach and do cash only, then have an ATM machine... I don't like that at all, its super inconvenient and would piss me off, lol, however it could be easier and help you guys be more efficient and faster, plus it also saves money (no credit card fees). And places very obvious signs around, including reminders on the menu or at the table. You just have to keep a super tight watch on all that cash though... on second thought, cash only is probably too risky. \\n\\n\\nETC - To Patrons/Customers:\\n-  Parking is also tough here, but you can usually find some parallel street parking nearby, or you can by $10 for one of the several lots in the area (lots that are targeted to tourist). \\n- To go orders seemed to move quicker.\\n-  Seat yourself if no one has helped you.\\n- Look and see what you want to order before you get here so that you can give them your complete order the first time they greet you. \\n\\nSUMMARY: \\nThe food is fresh and good... I want this place to win, but it's disorganized and the wait time is very long. I still think everyone should give them a try atleast once. \\n\\n:-)"},{"name":"In a Pickle Breakfast & Lunch","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"Toasted coconut french toast with bananas.

Giving 3 stars because we are frequent visitors and have had good experiences in the past. 4 of us went to eat, drink and play trivia. 1/2 of our party arrived about 20 min before the second half. The first half of us were seen right away and served drinks. The second half showed up and another 20 min past before a server even acknowledged their existence. (40 min between table visits). The food we ordered came out at different times with significant delays in each of our meals. The hotdog came out first, then the pizza, then the fries, then the wings...Each of these items mentioned had about 15 min waiting time in between. I understand cook times vary and a packed house makes it difficult to feed everyone but it seemed like there was no kitchen management at all. It's a little frustrating when one person at the table is finished with their meal before the next even comes out. We were later told what had happened. Someone had a kitchen emergency and had to be taken to the hospital earlier in the night. Obviously very serious but that's where communication comes in.

Parking was a headache.  Everyone seemed to be parking on the street so i circled around the block 4 times and saw no valet sign on the main street for the restaurant.  So i thought that there was no valet service and that they had no parking lot.  Finally gave up and pulled into a street on the side of the restaurant and there it was, the valet stand!  I wasn't sure if valet was complimentary because the valet stand just indicated \\"valet\\" for Barcelona.  There was no telling if there were any charges for valet or if it was complimentary.  But I wasn't about to circle the block 5 more times so i gave my car to the valet.  This would be problematic for first timers like myself in an area that I wasn't familiar with.  \\n\\n(Problem #2-Seating)\\nI went here with 5 other very hungry co-workers on a Saturday night.  I didn't think there would a table for us immediately and expected to wait.  To my amazement, they sat us right away at a tiny round table right next to the kitchen and server's area.  Not ideal for a big party.  I would have preferred to wait a little to get seated at a bigger table so that we weren't sitting elbow to elbow and having our purses knocked around  by anyone and everyone going in and out of the kitchen.  If the host would have asked us if we prefer a bigger seating area with a little bit of wait, I think all of us would have gladly waited around. \\n\\n(Problem #3-Untrained server)\\nFor drinks, our table ordered a couple of beers, sweet tea, glass of wine, jack & coke, and buttery nipple.  Server brought us unsweet tea, severely cracked beer glass that no one noticed but no flaws escape my eyes.  We asked for another glass and they gave us another free beer on the house. Too bad a fly decided to take a bath in the new beer glass.  What a waste of 2 beers.  Server did not seem to even know what buttery nipple was but she took the order without asking any questions.  Guess what? I never got my buttery nipple. Server completely forgot and I wasn't going to remind her.  She brought us unsweet tea.  I couldn't get a hold of the server for the next 20 minutes as she had gone missing in action at other tables.  I just grabbed the food runner and asked him to bring some sweetener.  I got tired of stirring sugar into each glass so i dumped 5 packs of Splenda into the carafe and stirred it with a butter knife.  How stupid did i look? Simply because the server accidentally brought us unsweet tea. And this is just with our drink orders.  \\n\\n(Problem #4-Food)\\nWe ordered about 8 tapas dishes and 2 orders of paella.  $38 for 2 orders of paella....too pricey for my taste buds but who cares?  It was going to be on company's dime so why not? I am not a fan of paella because it reminds me of a wet seafood fried rice but i know what a good paella is supposed to taste like.  This paella had plenty of seafood on top but when i dug into it to serve it to people, the rice underneath was crisp and stuck on the pan. Great, instead of a wet seafood fried rice, we got a crispy overcooked seafood fried rice. No one at the table was impressed.\\n\\nI ordered a few vegetable tapas plates and was not impressed. Brussel sprouts were burnt black and swimming in oil (kinda defeats the purpose of ordering a vegetable dish for health), spinach and chick peas had a cheap miso paste taste to it that i did not care for, and potato dish was just sitting on top of mayo and ketchup with cayenne pepper sprinkled on top. How creative? Mushroom & goat cheese had not much of a taste, skirt steak was just about the only thing that actually had somewhat of a flavor but it was rather dry and overcooked. Perhaps the kitchen chef likes to let dishes sit for too long over fire and throws in basic ingredients just for the sake of color. Out of 8 dishes, you would expect at least a few to taste good.  Every dish was a fail.\\n\\nManager emailed me after reading my review and asked us to come back to dine on the house.  At least the manager is doing a great job monitoring online reviews and i was pleasantly surprised.  Oh wait, there was one tasty thing! The churro with chocolate dipping sauce for dessert. If I'm ever in the mood for a homemade churro and i happened to be in Inman Park (probably never), then maybe a future visit is in the stars. But if you like to sip on 50% off wine while sitting next to a giant outdoor fireplace with someone you are meeting for the first time, this may be a great place for you.

One steps into a relatively small space, tastefully decorated with colorful tablecloths, tiled mirrors, wall murals, and delicate chandeliers. My first thought was to definitely make reservations before I head out for dinner.\\n\\nThe menu combines typical Tandoori Muglai cuisine coupled with South Indian staple favorites. Considering this is the third restaurant by Mr. Kumar; at first glance it seems to encompass the best of his other popular restaurants Aashirwaad and Bombay Caf√©.\\n\\nThe lunch menu is a sparse example of their dinner offerings; leaning towards luncheon platters which if I had to guess were designed to attract the dash in and out corporate crowd in the surrounding locale by keeping the menu limited and convenient to save time and turn tables fast.\\n\\nThe food to my pleasant surprise was rather decent compared to rest of the Indian restaurants in CFL. The lunch portions are huge and 2 people could easily share one thali though the prices in comparison to dinner aren't per se significantly lower. \\n\\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was made with tandoori chicken (not plain chicken) adding the extra oomp to the dish. It was adequately spiced (by Indian-American standards) and was served with fresh naan and basmati rice highly fragrant with cloves and cardamom.  My thali also came with dal, fresh salad, raita, and pickle.  The raita for a change wasn't watered down; all in all a tasty and wholesome meal.\\n\\nThe wait staff was friendly and polite but lacked the discerning eye for basic table service like clearing the table of dirty dishes before serving the dessert or cheque \\n\\nTheir website could greatly benefit from making it user friendly. No point having social media links if the back links don't work.\\n\\nReluctantly but with assurance I can state that Tamarind Restaurant might be my 'to go' restaurant when I am craving Indian food and for a change would like to be dined and wined rather than slaving in the kitchen. Over all the food was fresh, tasty, flavorful; the staff is knowledgeable and eager to please.

I rarely give them out, especially at super-hyped places.  But this is a winner.\\n\\nWe'd been meaning to go here for awhile.  We decided on Cajun for a date night, and this seemed to somewhat fit the description, so we dropped in.  We were a bit worried about being able to get in at 8 on a Friday in the Short North, especially when parking was hard, but they weren't very busy.  It filled up while we ate, so maybe we got there before the rush.  \\n\\nSweetie took driver's ed with the chef, but he wasn't there and we didn't tell anyone till the end.  Neither of us would let that kind of thing influence a review anyway.  Well, if it had been bad, we would just discuss it between ourselves and practice \\"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all\\" in public.\\n\\nIt was great.  I mean, really great, start to finish.  Massive pros, few cons.  We started with corn fritters- good, especially when paired with the remoulade or the chowchow.  We both had sweet tea- darn good.\\n\\nShe had a plate of side dishes: red beans and rice, mac and cheese, and greens.  I tasted each, and we pretty much agreed about them.  The red beans and rice were amazing- I don't remember having any that good in New Orleans.  The perfect blend of flavors and textures, with just-right rice topped with beans that were tender but not mushy, and packed with flavor.  The mac and cheese was very very good.  Not Sweetie's-mom's good, but almost, and in a slightly different style.  The pasta and sauce were very creamy, plus there was a slice of cheese on top with some green onions.  The low point was the greens.  We both love collards, and these were more of a mix.  She didn't like them at all, I thought they were decent but unspectacular.  Still good greens, just not our thing.\\n\\nI was all over the menu.  I thought about the much-loved chicken, but we just got our HCT swag in the mail and haven't been there in a while so maybe I was feeling too loyal to them to try someone else's.  The special was a turkey pot pie, which sounded good but just wasn't what I was in the mood for.  Then I saw it- chicken fried steak.  Sweetie already knew that was what I was getting, especially when she saw the gravy: two meats, bacon and sausage.  The waiter added that there's also ham.  So, yeah.  I had to.  It came with perfect mashed potatoes- barely mashed, and subtly flavored.  The steak was good- thin, tender, with a great crust. The gravy was fantastic: thick, packed with flavor (and meat,) and not enough to overwhelm everything else.  \\n\\nWe had to have beignets for dessert, even though we had leftovers.  The beignets themselves were very good.  Lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  And then I dipped one into the caramel sauce... and stopped in mid-sentence.  Anything that keeps us from talking (or looking at our phones) is a rarity.  And this stuff did it.  There were moans.  Meaningful looks.  Long silences...\\n\\nPrices are a little high, but worth it for the quality of food.  Plus they donate some every night to a specific charity.  They use lots of local ingredients.  Service was great- friendly, efficient, and unobtrusive, just the way I like it.  We did end the meal talking with our server about his upcoming trip to New Orleans, and shared some tips.

Lunch is straight ahead, good vegetarian in that they try and make the best of veggies, rather than relying on simulated meat like so many other veg restaurants do.  A reasonable variety of items, particularly vegan.  They present all the basics, and try very hard.  The tempeh Reuben is \\"to die for\\", and some of the vegan desserts are a welcome treat to the dairy-intolerant.  My only real criticism is that their sauces seem to lack variety and sophistication, tasting ever so much like doctored ketchup. The dinner menu is another story.  While it includes some of the lunch items, there are a number of entrees that are complex, sophisticated, and compete with any of the fancier restaurants that serve meat.  The portions at supper are quite large, lunch more reasonable. I'll keep going back and trying new items, but try and remember to ask them to leave their tomato based sauces off the plate."},{"name":"One Saigon","address":"979 Hornby St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I looked through some noodle, ramen, and pho places nearby and most seemed similarly rated.

Hated the service.\\n\\nCOMMENTS:\\n\\nSometimes I'm just in the mood for spicy and meaty Korean dishes and this place doesn't disappoint.  I really enjoyed my Dolsop Bim Bim Bop, especially because they did it right and the rice became crunchy at the bottom of the stone bowl.  I wish they were a bit more generous with the beef in this dish, though.  They must have disappointed the beef.  The kimchee pancake was excellent and the tempura shrimp and vegetables were perfectly fried...just the right amount of crispiness.\\n\\nYou may wonder by I give an overall 4 rating if the highest sub category rating I gave was a 3.5.  I really like Korean BBQ :)   And, the company was stellar and that nudges things up.\\n\\n--\\n\\nYou know, the combo of meats was delicious and fun, and i agree the kimchee pancake were great and the tempura shrimp and vegetables were perfect. The place is cute, in a predictable way. But man did the service suck!  Our waitress, who looked like an Asian Lisa Loeb, should, like Loeb, stick to singing,  not waiting. She was terrible, confusing, confused, and sooooooooo sloooooooooow, especially after the food came out.  She was also exceedingly unhelpful about taking back Mike's dish when it wasn't what he expected. I'd go again for the food (and company) but the service was among the worst I've ever experienced, and erased all the happiness the food inspired.\\n\\n--\\n\\nNo interesting cocktails to order. The pancake and tempura appetizers were very good, I liked the Seafood Udon, it was nice and spicy, however I asked for the stir fried version - as I always get broth all over myself when trying to eat it. The service was horrible, we did have water refills. You are out of luck if you want more food or drinks, during your meal.\\n\\nOn a side note, I think the bad service illustrates the trap some family-operated businesses fall into.  LuLu, our struggling singer-songwriter-guitarist niece is having trouble making ends meet, so we'll let her work at Yasu until she gets her recording contract with Sony.  Obviously, this decision is made because they don't understand how important a role good service plays in the overall dining experience.\\n\\n--\\n\\nFood was better than anticipated.  Crispy tempura and super tasty kimchi pancakes were an excellent start to the meal!  the combo #1 platter was fun, but confusing.  So many side options, many of which were unrecognizable and had no sort of label or explanation.  I kept finding myself going back to rice because it was familiar, though each of the sides I tried, I really enjoyed!  I did find it dismaying that over half their menu was Japanese influenced, but the sushi chef was not there that night...  If that much of your menu will be unavailable, then either make it a supplemental part you hand out when he's working or you explain it to the customers before they order.\\n\\nService was atrocious.  there's really not much more to say about that.  I'm not sure what's happening lately, but First Friday has had the worst luck with service at restaurants lately.  The unintended side effect of slow service was we got to spend a lot of \\n\\nDecor was OK, but nothing special.

This was a little too dense and oily for me. The chicken was extremely flavorful and it almost made me think of a pot pie as I was biting into it. \\n\\nThe Vaca Frita was shredded beef with a citrus sauce. Without the sauce it would've been too dry to eat. The rice was a blend of beans and other delicious flavors. What I loved were there plantains. The best ones I have ever eaten.

I liked that this cannoli wasn't gigantic, and was the perfect snack size. They also fill to order, which kept the shell very fresh. There is no line here (like other Yelpers, I can't figure out why this is), so if you're in the mood for an awesome cannoli, or if you're in a hurry, skip the lines and head to Maria's!

I normally don't like dark meat but the way the chicken was cooked; it was fantastic! My one pet peeve about ordering a meal with veggies is how well they are cooked.

Often enough, all the vegetables I get at restaurants are soggy and overcooked. \\n\\nOverall, we sampled 4 other different dishes - Mango Curry, Duck Chili, Crispy Pad Thai and the Seafood Delight. The Mango Curry was less mango than it was curry but the flavor was still good. There are more appetizing choices on the menu, so I would recommend not getting the Mango Curry. Duck Chili was good...I'm not a big fan of duck because it's too greasy for me but Lime Leaf did a good job. It packed some heat so be careful if you order it. I like to judge a restaurant based on it's specialty dish. For Thai food, it is pad Thai. I like that they used crispy noodles for this version of pad Thai because it gave you lots of texture and flavors. This pad Thai was too sweet for me but overall still really tasty.

I used to go on a regular basis for breakfast/lunch, but the past few times I've gone I've been disappointed (especially in their french toast, which was delicious and has recently just been soggy and bland). \\n\\nPastries/baked goods are still okay - but I've stopped even trying to get real food, and their pastries are not good enough to balance out their noise level/ordering/pick-up system.\\n\\nThey are always insanely crowded. Their ordering system and food pick-up is incredibly inefficient. You stand in a mob of people and somehow it takes them 20 minutes to hand you the pre-made cupcake in front of you that you already paid for.\\n\\nIt's also incredibly loud and FULL of young kids/toddlers/babies. I know this is because it's near the Children's Museum, but seriously - if you're looking for a place to have a conversation with someone, no matter the time of day you visit, this is NOT the place to go. This is the place to go to hear screaming babies and stand in a mob of people all waiting 20 minutes to be handed a cookie."},{"name":"Cantonese BBQ Restaurant","address":"8388 Capstan Way, Suite1438","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"You know, it can't be bad if I've been here twice in two days.\\n\\nReminds me of places to eat back from the 70's and 80's before food became fashionable.\\n\\nBBQ items like BBQ pork, Roast pork and steamed chicken are premier items on the menu.\\n\\nIf you have a wheel chair, it's easy to get in and out.\\n\\nFood is good and price matches for efficiency.\\n\\nCheap eats?  This place qualifies and a group of 4 can have a good meal.\\n\\nOr you can dine on your own and just order a dish with rice or noodles.\\n\\nCASH ONLY is the only problem, which is why I'm only giving them a 3 star."},{"name":"Golden China Express","address":"3636 Main St","city":"Hilliard","stars":"4","text":"It is a small take out place with a few tables inside. I have never eaten inside so I cant really speak on that. If you do eat there just be aware it not a grand place. Anyway just to echo what others have said it is the best Chinese place in the Hilliard Area. The prices, portion and taste of food are good."},{"name":"Simplicity Wine & Eats","address":"4801 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Since I first reviewed Simplicity, it's definitely gone downhill. They've upped their prices, and I think the value of the food is even less. (Small portions for the price.)

Luckily there is a huge stack of foodie and Asian pop magazines. Once we were called, I felt like VIP ... actually just lucky to grab a table in the middle of the room. This not-so-large place can pack about 60 people with booths along both lengths of the walls. \\n\\nDim sum is a very quick order-and-chow kind of ordeal, so I was disappointed to see that only two of our 5 plates arrived to our table before they gave us our check. At first, I was understanding that it was busy, but the fact that the lady manager told us that our food already came, kind of ticked me off. Then she backtracked by saying that she could take the items off the receipt because the food would take too long or more like they didn't feel like serving us anymore. Not very welcoming!!\\n\\nThe first two plates we tried were the steamed buns (soup dumplings) and the chive-stuffed pies/empanadas. They were just okay with the chive pancake being the yummier of the two. After the above fiasco, we finally had the steamed spiced spareribs (overcoooked? but nicely presented on sweet potatoes), pan fried buns (white pillows with fried bottoms - YUM, but oily!), and  greasy pot stickers (weird dark crispy flakes stuck to the bottoms).\\n\\nI had much better dim sum and Taiwanese food in the past and won't be patronizing here if I can help it."},{"name":"Cackalack's Hot Chicken Shack","address":"26 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love the food here. So far it's the only spot in Portland I've found that has spicy fried chicken for a decent price. The blazer is my staple and I usually can't even finish it since it's so big. The chicken breast is also good and comes with a slice of toast. The triple X definitely lives up to its name in regards to spice. The Cajun fries are to die for as well, always crispy! The quality of Cackalack's hasn't failed me yet. As of 02/09/2016 the cart is temporarily closed but will open again across the street sometime soon. The location in Beaverton is still open!"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Killer pizza and fun atmosphere.

Damn, it was a good suggestion. \\n\\nMy sister and I arrived together. My stepmom was already there. And our dad arrived about 20 minutes later. Fortunately, this was no problem; stepmom was already seated and we were taken very good care of. This is a sign of good service to me! I do think the booths, with couch-like seats on each side, are really cramped and caused date-like proximity to my sister as well as nowhere to put her and my stepmom's various lady-bags and jackets. I would much rather have sat at a table.\\n\\nThe ambience of the place is really romantic, and I'm very likely to take a date here at some point. The bar area is pretty, the light is pleasant, and the service is great. There's a really great selection of in-house drinks, all of which sounded really good. I was in the mood for some bourbon, neat, so I took the recommendation of our waiter. I wish I could remember the name of what he brought me, because it was really good!\\n\\nI absolutely loved the food. I am a huge fan of Italian food, and this is some of the best I've had lately. The pasta e fagiole soup was a great starter, but the entress were the real standout. I ordered the black taglierini (LOVE black pasta) with a spicy tomato sauce and shrimp. Man, it was amazing. I can't recommend this dish enough - tender pasta, sweet shrimp, and the perfect amount of spice. \\n\\nI think this would have been an even better experience with a date, so I'm really excited to come back someday with a girl and really advantage of the ambience. Highly recommended!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The people who work here are super nice, friendly and efficient.

The employees are friendly.  The blonde woman in the morning is extra awesome.  Her cheeriness infects the customers.  \\n\\nThis Subway is also amazingly fast--it is like a Chipotle.  If you see a long line when you walk in, take heart because that line moves fast.  \\n\\nThe food is consistent with other Subways--acceptably tasty but not I-want-to-lick-my-plate-clean tasty.  They serve personal pizzas, soup, salad, and submarine sandwiches at really cheap prices.\\n\\nAs long as I am out here, this Subway will be my coffee and lunch place.  The bad parking lot and long walk to the restroom won't deter me.  I hate the parking lot because people heading east on Bee Caves or straight onto Westbank have to wait a long time at the light, the driveways are narrow, cars are often blocked, and at peak times, parking spots are scarce.  The restroom is shared with the other stores in the shopping center but it is very clean."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],L={key:0},D={key:1};function H(s,e,n,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-48c5f445"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/28.md","filePath":"people/28.md"}'),G={name:"people/28.md"},V=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
