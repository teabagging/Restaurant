That said, I have a couple of issues with them.\\n\\nOne is the price of their guacamole. To get just a small dollop on your burrito, it costs more than entire avocado - $2.  Their guac is delicious and far superior to that of my preferred burrito joint, Anna's Taqueria (Chipotle's lack of tomatoes in their guac seals it for me).  Just like a drug dealer, they get you hooked on the good stuff and then jack up the price.\\n\\nComplaint #2 - these Chipotle worshipers who claim that their place is far superior to all else, and competitor Qdoba is absolute shit.  This despite the fact that many of their menu items are nearly identical.  Chipotle is Ford and Qdoba is Mercury - a few subtle differences, but the nuts and bolts are largely the same.  Same tortillas, same rice, same (delicious) guacamole, same choices of salas including a corn-based one, same shredded cheese, very similar chicken (Chip's might be a tad spicier).\\n\\n99 times out of 100 I'm probably going to Anna's, but Chipotle makes a fine burrito as well - just a little overpriced and very similar to one I can get in Porter Square."},{"name":"Kappo At East End Market","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"My first time here thanks to fellow yelpers.

I would suggest for anyone to try something else. \\n\\n*Green Coconut Shrimp Curry: It thought the dish tasted like they used a conventional supermarket green curry paste instead of fresh ground of spices. (Maybe I'm wrong.) It just lacked a punch of flavor. \\n\\n*Basil Noodle: Spicy flat rice noodle stir fried with fresh basil, carrots, onion, broccoli, and bell peppers. Not bad.

I'll clarify the \\"bland\\" comment: Thai food, well done, has both complex and subtle flavoring.

I can't be the only one that has gone out for fondue and wanted to just skip the bread and veggies and eat the cheese fondue like a soup. Well, that's pretty much what the cheese soup was.

The sausage is really good too but the turkey (incredibly moist...esp for turkey) and the brisket (loved the crisp caramelized crust) are the stars. The ribs: meh. Really nice thick smoke ring and you can taste the smoke but they were not at all near as tender as ribs should be. My neighbor does better ribs so stay away. IDK how they make it but the potato salad might be the best ever. I think they smoke the potatoes then add some rub to it...that might be it but it's the most simple yet delish potato salad I've ever had. The slaw is another meh to me. It's really just cabbage with some vinegar. There needs to be more thought to it. Plus it''s pretty dry. The cobbler is bomb as well. The atmosphere is awesome and the experience as a whole feels very southern and Texan. I love this place and will gladly be back as I think it's great. Just avoid the ribs since they are not up to par (i'm guessing they don't steam them to create the fall of the bone tenderness) on the tender scale. Stick to the brisket and you won't leave unhappy.

The only comparable locations around the Boston area would be yumewokatare, sapporo ramen, and pikaichi, and they're all different in their own respects. The ramen here is very on point with some of the best I've ever tried both in Boston and Japan, and its chicken-based broth is very unique and flavorful! I would say that the ramen here could be described as a more traditional type than others. \\n\\nThe broth has a nice milky consistency (not too thick, not too thin either), and it doesn't taste as if you're drinking a very fatty soup base. It's perfect for a chill night when you crave some good broth! The noodles were cooked with good consistency, as they were both chewy and squishy, but not even close to being overcooked to the point where it breaks easily with a pinch of your chopsticks. I had the mega ramen, and I thought it was well worth the price of getting a little extra meat in my ramen, as Totto Ramen's claim to fame probably stems from their soup base and pork more than anything else in my opinion. The pork is charred beautifully, and the meat is tender enough that it falls right off when you chew it. The fat on the pork is BOMB. You can tell that it's been cooked for hours on end, and it just tastes like melted butter when you take a bite. It was really filling and it left me satisfied at the end of devouring a huge bowl of ramen goodness. \\n\\nPerhaps one of the best parts of visiting Totto ramen was actually the staff. I went early when it opened at 5pm for dinner service, since I was afraid of having to wait in a huge line to grab a seat since they are constantly busy due to their recent grand opening. I was able to get a seat quickly, and immediately I was greeted by my waitress, Erica. She was able to point out some nice additions that I could add into my ramen that made my experience more enjoyable, and I'm glad I went with her suggestions of adding an extra egg, seaweed, and also spicy sesame oil into my mega ramen. It was perfect, and well worth the additional cost to truly make my ramen experience wholesome. Even though it got busy relatively quickly, Erica was attentive and always checked up on me and her other patrons consistently throughout the course of the meal. I was scared that with the grand opening, it would be a rushed, get in and out quickly setting (as most ramen shops in Japan are similar in having limited seating and rushed service) but i was pleasantly surprised at how the staff was able to balance a busy filtering in of patrons along with maintaining quality service."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

I really didn't get much flavor other than hot.  The slaw was ok, but very very watery and didn't work with the sandwich for me.  There was supposedly an aoli but I couldn't really find it.

We will definitely be coming back.  My wife and I split the maz con pollo empanada and the classic picadillo empanada.  They were both very good, I would recommend getting the maz con pollo over the picadillo.  The corn was creamier, it was a better mix between sweet and savory.  The chicken felt softer than the beef as well.  \\n\\nFor the main entrees, I had the Plato Cubano and my wife bad the Camarones Enchilados.  We both had the black beans and white rice.  The pork on the cubano was incredible, slow roasted and melt in your mouth soft.  It was a great mix of texture and flavor.  The beans were so well seasoned, they were a bit salty with a little tang.  The yuca was soft, almost like a baked potato.  The texture was creamier than a potato, probably due to the way it was cooked.  \\n\\nFor the drinks we had the sugar cane lemonade and the yerba mate.  The lemonade had enough sour taste from the lemon and the sugar cane juice was just sweet enough.  It was a great mix.  Not an overly sweet lemonade like most people make it was a more refreshing drink.  \\n\\nOverall, the environment was pretty nice.  It felt very local.  Our heater was out, which was a little bit of a bummer, but not a deal breaker.  We also brought our dog with us, which was super great!  Any place that lets us take our dog is an extra plus in our book.  The service was great, even with how busy they were.

I have a relatively significant lunchtime appetite and 2 tacos will always suffice.  The only thing I question about the place is the cheese -- they are single slices of American.

The tempura prawns were large and delicious. The fried tofu was good but soggy around where the sauce was touching it. The beef was good and not too tough.

I'll never again be satisfied with the noodles I make at home or the ones I order elsewhere.\\n\\nI had the best pasta dish of my life at this restaurant, and I'll dream of Giacomo's until I return. Angels sang when the plate was set before me. Perfect texture, al dente, flavorful, and everything else a noodle should be. \\n\\nThis should be enough for you to get over to Giacomo's, but if you need more convincing, read on...\\n\\nI had a special --¬†homemade fusilli noodles with shrimp and lobster in a scampi sauce --¬†but if you can't get this dish, just order another one with the same noodle type. I liked that the menu is fairly small and the dishes are fairly straightforward. There's a lot to be said for mastering the basics and making them taste so delicious.\\n\\nLike the rest of the Yelp crowd, I waited in line to be seated. It was down to the corner of the street and as a party of one, it took about 45 minutes to be seated. Sometimes you share a table with another party, but I had one of two seats at the bar. They were a bit squished, but I wasn't bothered at all, and I had a nice view of the other 9 or so tables in the restaurant. I could also watch the cooks do their thing! I did notice that a party of bigger guys seemed to have some trouble crowding into their seats -- just something to take into consideration. In general, I have little sympathy for all the people complaining about the tiny space and crowdedness of the restaurant. A glance in the door or through the giant windows at the front of the building can tell you what to expect in advance. If it's not your thing, move on! \\n\\nService, as you could imagine, is fast. They have a lot of people to accommodate! Again, I generally agree that rushing through a meal is no fun, but I didn't feel rushed so much as I understood their interest in efficiency. With a line that wraps around the corner and prices that are super affordable, it's understandable that you can't take all the live long day dining. If you did, they'd never seat anyone or make any money.  Others have suggested that you should have an idea of what you'd like before you're seated, which is reasonable since you're likely going to be in line for more than enough time to read the menu. With that in mind, I wasn't at all bothered by the pace of my dining experience.\\n\\nI ordered some prosecco and my meal, that was it! The waitress was a little curt -- for example I asked about sauce options and rather than saying \\"Oh, they're explained on the back of the menu,\\" she just flipped the menu over in front of me and walked off. Maybe it's a Boston thing? I thought she was having a bad day, but later she was very friendly. Who knows! Not great, but not the end of the world either. \\n\\nMy only gripe was that as a lone diner, I couldn't eat more things! In fact, I had just enjoyed a late lunch at another excellent restaurant, but was determined to eat at Giacomo's before the end of my trip, so I struggled to make room for my dish alone. Had I come hungry, though, it would have been tempting to order food for three. Portions are generous, prices are super reasonable.\\n\\nI really can't say enough, just make sure you go.

It becomes a back-and-forth affair typically, with everyone having an excuse to why they don't want to go somewhere, usually being somewhere in the vein of \\"too filling,\\" \\"too much wait,\\" \\"just had it/something like it,\\" and the most blasphemous, \\"I don't like pizza.\\"\\n\\nDue to that last one, a place like Antico had eluded my radar for the longest time until recently, and I have to say that it's a crying shame that it's taken so long for the opportunity to arise for me to indulge it, because I really do love pizza, as any real 'Murican really should.\\n\\nThey're located at the very edge of the neighborhood that houses pretty much nothing but Georgia Tech students, and the tiny sliver of Hemphill Avenue is the only thing that separates them from the school, and the nightmareish traffic that tends to accumulate on Northside Drive.  They have a very tiny parking lot that probably can park less than 20 cars, and like I did, most people end up parking on Ethel Street.\\n\\nI thought I would be getting the jump on the Friday night dinner rush, coming just about right at 5 pm, but clearly I was mistaken.  Just about every table and seat was already occupied, and there were a few people already in line.  However, thankfully much to the agreement of what many have already stated, the line moves quickly, and they're extremely efficient at getting the pizzas out to their customers.  Going back to the table situation, if you're unaware, Antico is a pretty communal place, so if you're dining in, you're extremely likely to be seated near or across complete strangers, as they pretty much have nothing but bar seating or giant communal banquet style bench seats and tables.  And based on my experience there, Antico is clearly a place where parents have zero qualms bringing their children to, so if it irks you to be seated near kids, be mindful of the fact that parents will bring them here.\\n\\nI'm not going to act like I'm an expert on Napoletana style pizza or anything, but we had ordered a Diavola, which to me is pretty much \\"pizza with lots of meat on it.\\"  As stated previously, it came quickly, served on a giant metal tray, looking delicious as can be.  Digging right into it, the tastebuds are greeted with fresh flavors, and a reprieve from the bland and generic flavor of that of your McPizza Joints that aren't the worst things in the world, but I was neither drunk nor was it past 10 pm at the time, so freshly made with fresh ingredients seemed so welcoming.\\n\\nThe center of the pizza is a little on the soggy side, but the flavor of the dough outright was excellent.  The underrated crusts, were soft and still had a wonderful subtle flavor, without feeling like eating burnt cardboard, nor squeezing them didn't ooze grease like a Pizza Hut pizza crust would.\\n\\nNeedless to say, my first Antico experience didn't last long, because the pizza was more or less demolished with haste.  Overall, I'm very pleased with Antico, and I look forward to the next opportunity I get to go again.  I'm not the type to scoff at a $20+ pizza if the ingredients and quality are good, which they were, but I do wish they were a larger establishment, because if I'm ever in an impatient mood, I could see myself getting exasperated at the notion of having to wait for something I want.\\n\\nThis is the kind of place that I'd definitely put high on my mental list to bring guests or visitors to the city to, and the type of place that I'd want to simply go to with my own friends and acquaintances on non-occasions too."},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Went there for a second time, and brought a friend.

Here's my secret to avoid the long wait if you are starving and don't have any beer to pass the time: Go place a to go order from the building on your left as you enter the parking lot, then proceed to the benches which are under the canopy of oak trees to eat your food. Make sure you do this on a nice day, obviously you do not want to do this on an overly cold or rainy day!

If you like moister brisket, just ask and they will serve it to you. The sides are a potato salad without any mayo, vinegar cole slaw and pinto beans and some bread.

I have now been here for numerous meals at the bar (my favorite place to grab a seat), brunches (which. as of this writing they are moving to their sister restaurant Kirkland), and a tasting menu in their formal dining area.\\n\\nI do prefer dining in their bar area because I'm usually not in the mood for a big tasting menu and its less formal with more of a cocktail bar feel. The dining area where the tasting menu is ordered is white tablecloth but not overly formal. They also have a 4 top bar that overlooks the kitchen. The kitchen definitely has a \\"Masterchef\\" and military-like efficiency to it, these guys are very talented.\\n\\nThe Burger - Not much to say about this burger that hasn't been said. Not only is it one of the best in Boston, it's one of the best burgers in America. My only criticism is the homemade ketchup. Maybe I'm a peasant but I prefer Heinz. Everything else is perfection. You can only order these at the bar area and they have a limited number daily so go early.\\n\\nRoasted Chicken - One of the best preparation of chicken I have ever had. Often I will think chicken is a boring menu pick, but not here. On my visit it was prepared 3 ways on the place.\\n\\nBone Marrow - My first experience with bone marrow was at Craigie so don't be afraid. It spreads on bread like butter and is similar in a lot of ways. It came flavored with garlic and other spices.

I know there had to be a ton of sugar and caffeine in it, but it was great.\\n\\nThe service wasn't the fastest and they accidentally left a cup of soup on the bill that never arrived at the table, but besides that, Harry & Sons was fine.

(I swear his eyes rolled back in his head when we asked if he'd tried TSP).  So we dropped our stuff in the room and headed over.  It was that perfect time, just after lunch, so we had the place pretty much to ourselves.  We sat at the bar and had waaaay too much to eat and drink.  (We didn't know at the time that we would return...)\\n\\nWe started with the Ossabaw charcuterie platter, which contained Finocchiona, a garlic and fennel dry cured sausage (think delicious salami), Coppa, a spicy cured pork shoulder (think delicious dried ham), and Porchetta (think f-ing delicious soft, moist ham).  We added some stinky cheese, the wonderful Moses Sleeper.  Baguette slices served alongside were properly charred and crunchy.  Next up, a Sausage, White Bean, Roasted Garlic pizza to split.\\n\\nDrinks.... damn.  Why can't I remember our bartender's name?  Damn.  He's one of the reasons we came back a second time, and sat at the bar, in front of him.  Damn, damn, damn.  He was so knowledgeable about drinks and beer.  We drank a lot.  Drinks are expensive here.  Yes, we were on vacation, so prices don't count.  But if you're not on vacation, drinks are expensive.\\n\\nThe second time we ate at TSP, two day later, we built our own charcuterie platter with Soppressata (think another delicious salami) and Chicken Liver Mousse (think... OK, get the damn mousse.  I loved this one so much I ordered another round after my first toast was gone).  This time our cheese choice was Robiola, which was soft and yummy.  And more drinks, of course.  Our second visit was late on a weekend evening, so it was livelier, louder and therefore, I was more annoyed.  Drinking helped.\\n\\nWe loved The Salty Pig.

It was not the best I have had, but for a chain restaurant it was not bad at all.  There was a bit more fat on it than I would have liked, but that's okay.

If you are a cheese lover, make sure to get this with the Mac & Cheese side.  It's like a cheese diarrhea on a plate.  The chicken was good and the Mac & Cheese was very good.  I am sure this rates on the 1,000+ scale in caloric content, but once in a while it is okay to consume this much.\\n\\nApparently Carrot Top works in the kitchen at this location because there was a long red hair in my girlfriend's chicken.

(now)... but I think foodies should know why they're going... so to explain here's a crazy basketball analogy (because, as my friends will tell you... i LOVE crazy basketball analogies):\\nEating here is like watching Kobe Bryant in his rookie season, before he was the best closer in the game... the season he averaged 8 points a game, and airballed 3 shots in the last few mintues of an elimination playoff game... \\n\\nThat sounds awful, but here's why it's not... because folks who watched him that year will tell you even though he hadn't come into his own yet, you KNEW he was GOING to be great, every time he touched the ball, you felt like SOMETHING was going to happen, and you didn't know what it was, or why you felt that way... you just did.\\n\\nI think that it's at that precocious stage that a player is the most fun to watch.  There's a sense of wonder in uncovering something most people haven't noticed yet, there's the excitement that comes with not knowing if the next shot will be a swish or an airball, and there's the almost parental joy of watching someone enormously talented find their unique expression.  \\n\\nWhat that translates to in foodie is that the plates are good (in shades that run from pretty to holy crap), but it's a little scattered in terms of overall effect.  With most top tier restaurants eating a full dinner tells you something about what the chef thinks about food, and I'm not sure I get that (even from the 5 course wine pairing dinner i attended).  The dishes vary so much sometimes that I can't tell that they're cooked by the same person (although given the size of their kitchen there can be no doubt that is was).  You can see this as a testament to the skill of the chef, being able to seamlessly move from one cuisine to another, but as a diner it leaves me a little bit confused.  This is a pretty small nitpick, but I think it's the difference between an excellent meal and an unforgettable one, which is kind of the space I think these guys want to play in.\\n\\nAnyway, that's what it's like.  The food is, really good now, don't get me wrong... people wouldn't be so positive about the restaurant if the food WASN'T good... it's just that eating here, and hearing Patrick (and the rest of the staff) talk about food makes me think that things are only going to get better.  A few folks have mentioned the scallops (they're really good), the braised beef at lunch is excellent, and my personal favorite is the radishes (which sounds simple, but is something you NEED to try), of course given the seasonality of the menu anything I tell you is probably off the menu now anyway.\\n\\nSo in summary: Yay! go now so you can say you ate at this place way back when it was just a small hole in the wall in lake oswego :)"},{"name":"Screaming Goat","address":"900 W 10th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food, beer, lots of big screens, and it's cheap! What more could you want!\\n\\nI've been going to Screaming Goat for a while and I love this place. It's a twist on traditional Mexican food. It's got a lot of flavor, but it's not greasy. I like that they keep the prices down and not force you to pay for sides of beans and rice that I normally don't eat anyway. It's Mexican a la carte! The tacos are so good and filling with plenty of meat. The chicken flautas in the tomatillo sauce are awesome (especially when nursing a hangover). The salsa is so good. It reminds me of the salsa my grandmother used to make with plenty of garlic and spices. The burgers, the tortas, burritos... ok, I need to stop or I will go on.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is cool, and they always have a game you want to watch on one of the many flat panels they have.

He complied. He wasn't very interested in hearing what she had said, but I will tell you that although through the years we have may have had inferior service at different places, NEVER have we experienced a waitress that was so rude.

I passed it on a visit to Atlanta a couple years back but never made it inside.

The place seems small from the entrance but don't be fooled. It's narrow but it's also loooong. Our server was really friendly and he brought us two giant mason jars of water to start with (because what's a good hipster bar without mason jars, right?) and he was extremely knowledgeable on the menu. We only came for beers but he still gave us the rundown on food as well as drinks and gave us ample time to decide on the beers. The beer list alone is about ten pages long, so prepare yourself for an overwhelming but satisfying selection. \\n\\nSince it was a cold-as-hell Atlanta winter night, I decided on a stout to warm my belly. They were out of the one I wanted but our server was quick to suggest one that was just as enticing, with \\"milk and cookies\\" in the title. It proved delicious, like drinking an oatmeal cookie dipped in coffee. A heads up, most are craft beers so be ready to spend around $5-$7 on a pint.

We got there around 8:45pm on Wednesday night, we were seated away. Later on we found out that we were extremely lucky because usually there is a long line outside the restaurant and it goes all the way across the street. Average wait is about 1 to 1.5 hours. The place is also very small with a homey and intimate feel (not the romantic kind).\\n\\nWe started with a small calamari ($7) and then we both ordered off of the specials that night. I got the pan roasted striped bass with mushroom risotto, grilled baby asparagus, and truffle aioli ($22). The staff was so efficient and everything came so quickly.\\n\\nCalamari was so delicious. The squid was perfectly fried and the dish came with some fried some hot peppers. The marinara sauce was so flavorful. Some may find it a bit greasy but whatever, you're ordering fried calamari!\\n\\nI got the bass which was cooked well. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, though it was a bit fishy if you were just eating it by itself. The mushroom risotto was a bit too rich for my taste, probably due to the excess cheese in there (not a huge fan of cheese myself). But when I ate the fish and the risotto with the truffle aioli, everything came together beautifully. I could totally tasted the truffle in there. \\n\\nBF got the homemade fusilli with lobster and shrimp ($26) in the giacomo's sauce (a red sauce that used lobster broth with a tiny splash of cream). Portion was huge, lobster meat and shrimps abundant, and fusilli al dente!! Sauce was amazing and the whole dish came piping hot. I found myself wanting his pasta more than my own fish. \\n\\nWe both finished everything except some risotto. Needless to say there wasn't any room left for dessert. :) We will definitely come back here to try other pasta dishes on our next trip here in May.\\n\\nPS - We walked by Giacomo's on Saturday at 5:05pm on our way on the Freedom Trail, it was a full house and the line already wen all the way to the stop sign and around the corner.\\n\\nPSS - BTW it's cash only."},{"name":"Pizzeria Uno Chicago Bar & Grill","address":"Porter Sq","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Mediterranean flat bread pizza was delicious and surprisingly un-chain restaurant like.

If they're not burnt, hot and thoroughly cooked, I'm happy.  Well, Chick-fil-a got 2 out of 3 right.  The fries were lukewarm at best.  My fruit cup, on the other hand, was better than expected.  I've also had a salad here-- it comes with cheese though, so if you're not into dairy, stay away from the salad.  The restaurant is clean and staff are all really nice.

Charcuterie options take up half the weekend brunch menu, and the other half includes breakfast, salad and sandwich options, most of which incorporate slices of meats, and/or bold cheeses.  Of course, for those boozy-brunch-inclined, the cocktail menu isn't long, but is unique, and has season appropriate offerings.\\n\\nI started with an order of porchetta ( pork shoulder), which was served with some crostini, a grainy mustard and a small pile of sliced pickles. The meat was sliced paper thin, and sprinkled lightly with fleur de sel, and a drizzle of oil. I'm used to meat platters being served with little cornichons, but I cant say that I didn't enjoy these. Not very sour, and a little bit sweet, the pickles were juicy while still offering a satisfying crunch. The meal was definitely off to a great start.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my enjoyment of the meal then quickly took a nosedive. The escarole salad was scattered with hot peppers, hardboiled eggs, lightly pickled radishes, and cubes of provolone. Tossed in a bowl before plating, the heavier toppings to the salad (read:everything) sunk under the greens, and I would have preferred the cheese like that to be grated, sliced or shaved over the salad as a biting directly into a harder, stronger cheese like a provolone isn't ideal. All in all, the dish seemed like a poor attempt at a nicoise salad.\\n\\nWith great ambiance and a unique cocktail menu, Salty Pig is a great place for drinks and a snack. However, it wouldn't be a go-to for a proper meal.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, 3 hedgehogs out of 5.\\n\\nhttp://wp.me/p4qTTI-W"},{"name":"Capitol Highway Deli Foodmart","address":"11102 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The people in here are so sweet, I'm more likely to buy from here rather than the 7-11 across the street.

I am a dessert connoisseur and I must say that dessert if the best dessert I have ever tasted in my life. The chocolate just melts in your mouth and the coconut ice cream is light in flavor and complements the chocolate without overpowering the oozing chocolate.  They also have a pig roast special on Sundays and  1/2 price bottles of wine. The wine list is extensive and if you are not sure what you like the servers are happy to accommodate you with a taste or two.

Finally, I was seated, but was told that I could not have a seat in the back even through there was already 2 people eating back there in an area with 4 other open seats. Fine. I'll deal with it. \\n\\nOnce seated, it took my \\"waiter\\" another 10 minutes to acknowledge my existence as he was watching TV on one of their two screens. Again, whatever, I had some time so I could forgive this example of poor service. \\n\\nWhat I cannot and will not forgive is absolute rude snark from the the manager, Brian. I asked my slow and struggling waiter for some salsa. He said, \\"in a minute\\" and proceeded to work on some housekeeping tasks involving a massive stack of tickets that had built up for some reason. I wasn't glanced back at. 8 minutes later, (I was timing things at this point) I asked a bearded guy for some Salsa. He nodded and continued doing what he was doing. I said to him, \\"I've been waiting 8 minutes since I asked my waiter.\\" Without looking at me he sits the salsa in front of me and says, \\"Yeah, I don't know how you've made it this long without Salsa, hard life.\\" \\n\\nI have NEVER been treated so rudely in a restaurant/eatery in my entire life. Not in Paris, not in India, not in Laos, not by Boston or NYC food trucks.

While Craigie on Main is definitely in its top tier, it's not the most AMAZING food I've ever had. It's very good but not \\"5 star\\" good.\\n\\nTo be honest, I don't remember all the nitty-gritty details of the meal so here's what I do remember:\\n\\n- We ate WAY too much bread. The bread is tasty but its also extremely filling. By the time we had our entree, I could barely eat another bite of food for fear of bursting. I actually looked up how much food the human stomach can handle before bursting. It's about 4,000 cc's. While some people have eaten significantly more without exploding, I don't recommend trying. Apparently, you will die of sepsis. It's not pretty or quick; it's supposedly pretty agonizing. \\n\\nAnyway, back to the review...\\n\\n- We ordered the Crispy-Fried Pig's Tails and Grilled Spanish Octopus as starters. I ordered the Octopus and wasn't particularly impressed. This is a tricky dish to get right. Like scallops, if it's overcooked, it loses all its delicious texture and flavor. These were probably just a bit overdone. Sadly, they had little flavor. \\n\\nI was a bit reluctant to try to Pig's Tails but my BF knows his food so I was more willing than usual. As he went to cut me a piece, there was no meat to be eaten...it was just a giant hunk of fat. Eventually, he was able to find a piece that was more meat than fat. It was tasty but again, not mind blowing. \\n\\n- For our entree, we ordered the Whole Roasted Misty Knolls Chicken. When they say \\"whole\\" they mean it's the entire chicken. And although it says \\"For Two\\" in parentheses, it's really enough to feed 4 people who also ordered appetizers. Was it delicious? Completely. But was it worth spending $70 on it? Not really. We were so full that we could barely eat more than a few bites. We wound up taking it home but had dinner plans most of the coming week and wound up tossing the majority of it. It was utterly painful to toss more than half of a $70 chicken. \\n\\nFinally, the restaurant gives you a complementary dish before your official meal begins. Honestly, I don't even remember what it was. All I know is that I wouldn't have ordered a starter had I known how much food was coming our way. \\n\\nGranted, I haven't tried their burger (which they're known for).

Very \\"big house\\" style in that back room.  But, thank goodness for the back room because there was a live band playing on stage in the main dining hall and we were only JUST after meeting up after some of us not having seen each other for about 12 years (shout out to my girl Kim I hope my snoring didn't keep you awake all weekend!!) so we needed to talk and it was much quieter in the back room. \\n\\n[Side note: a thousand apologies to the party of 10 sitting at the table beside us...we realized the next day that we were fucking outrageously loud at our storytelling ....HELLOO JR!!!....and there was absolutely no need for the screeching of hysterical pants wetting laughter]\\n\\nService:\\nOur waitress was lovely.

However, I was surprised with what I got.  The fish was shaped like a square and while not processed I kinda felt it was because of the shape.   The batter was not crispy...it was soggy.  The fries were frozen steak fries.  This was no Leo Burdock's one and one.  However, on a previous visit we had ordered the cocktail sausages for one of the kids....and ate them all ourselves and I don't remember having any complaints about the food the first time.

Neither of us had ever been, but with all the great reviews on Yelp, I was down to try it!\\n\\nThere was a happy hour until 7pm, and everything on the happy hour menu was $4. We both thought this was a pretty good deal. My friend ordered edamame, 4 rolls, tuna nigiri, and tea. I ordered the ice man roll, the venom roll, and salmon sashimi. Each roll/sashimi/nigiri came out on their own individual plate, so we ended up not having enough space on our table for all of the plates. I'm a little confused as to why the rolls were plated this way. My two pieces of salmon sashimi came out on a plate that was literally 10 times too big. My friend and I took the initiative and combined the rolls on a couple of plates, so we had space to eat. The $4 rolls looked a little unappetizing. I had a couple of pieces and didn't particularly enjoy them. I also was not impressed by the rolls that I ordered. I did however really enjoy the two pieces of salmon sashimi that I ordered.\\n\\nThe server was very nice, but I think our server could have been better trained. When asked about the seasonal IPAs, I was met with \\"We have a ... uhh... pumpkin? octoberfest? pineapple?\\" None of the answers were confident, so I decided against a drink. Our server confused the salmon sashimi and tuna nigiri, which isn't a huge deal but they are easily noticeably different. The service was also slow even though the restaurant was more of the empty side.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I most likely will not be back here for sushi."},{"name":"Pizzeria Uno Chicago Bar & Grill","address":"Porter Sq","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I'm not a huge fan of Chicago style pizza.

Overall, I think it's fairly safe to say that this place is going to be a formidable competitor in the Atlanta restaurant scene for some time to come.\\n\\nFood: Barcelona is a wine bar and restaurant specializing in traditional and well-executed Spanish tapas, or small plates. The restaurant has multiple locations throughout Connecticut, but the food quality is certainly not commensurate with what you'd expect from a chain. The menu is comprised of a series of tapas plates, larger entrees, and a selection of charcuteria and cheeses. They also offer alternative options that can be shared across the table, including Argentine mixed grill for parties of two and paella for parties between two and six. During my first visit, my dining partner and I opted for an assortment of tapas, including herbed goat cheese and mushrooms , spinach-chickpea casserole with cumin and garlic confit, homemade chicken empanadas, ham and cheese croquetas, and  braised rabbit. Each dish was impeccably prepared and featured exceptional flavor. For dessert, we opted for the warm churros (Spanish doughnuts), which were exquisite.\\n\\nService: The service is so attentive here that you may have to ask for some privacy. The restaurant was at capacity by 7:00 PM, but the waiter and bussers continued to provided pleasant, helpful, and efficient service throughout the meal.\\n\\nAtmosphere: I wouldn't be surprised if the individuals who transformed the interior of this space could also walk on water; the restaurant is tastefully decorated and shows no resemblance to the establishment that occupied this space previously. They also have a fairly large outdoor patio that wraps around the front and side of the building, complete with highly effective overhead heaters. Dress is casual and the clientele is mixed, but mostly adults and professionals.\\n\\nCost: Expensive by most standards, but well worth the price considering the stellar quality of the food. Tapas costs around $5 to $11, while cheese and meats are $6.50 each or three for $17.50. Larger entree-sized plates are between $13 and $27. From Sunday through Thursday, a sampler of six, eight, or ten different tapas can be purchased for $48, $60, and $70, respectively.\\n\\nOther: It's currently quit difficult to obtain an evening reservation at Barcelona and walk-ins can expect to wait well over an hour on weekends. They do accept reservations via their online system, but the time increments are incredibly bizarre; for example, our reservation time was 5:52 PM."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm not a pizza snob nor have I ever been to Italy.  Personally, I don't think there is anything wrong with Domino's.  That being said, Antico is the most delectable pizza I've ever put in my mouth.  Pizza wise, it's a notch above Fritti.  I also enjoy the vibe (other reviews speak to this) that the place is spittin at you.  Personally, I love the Italian opera blaring in the kitchen and Serie A (Italian soccer) on the TV.

And I ate a lot of them because that was the only thing palatable both times I went. But the kebabs aren't too far from Night Hawk frozen dinner steak fingers, and the rice was sometimes dry. You had to stir it up a little to not get the dry, crunchy grains.\\n\\nI guess if you're dying for Persian food you can come here and be okay. If you order off the menu, expect to pay well for it.

The Salt Lick was good a very long time ago before the bogus hype and fame kicked in. But now the food is marginal at best. A friend visiting from New England commented that a restaurant chain in Boston has much better ribs. Unfortunately, he had seen the hype in the media and wanted to check it out. I almost had to apologize. The food was bad and it certainly was not worth the drive much less the wait time to get seated. Sadly, the Salt Lick has reached iconic status and no reviewer wants to state the obvious that the emperor is not wearing any clothes. Same goes for those two pathetic excuses in Lockhart. Not just overhyped mediocre fare but borderline garbage. Even Rudy's is infinitely better. The best BBQ in Central Texas is Franklin's in East Austin along with the Iron Works on East Cesar Chavez.

It was one of the most expensive dinners I've had and while I certainly enjoyed my meal, it just didn't measure up to my high expectations. We had a chef tasting menu and I left feeling hungry after six dishes. While very well thought-through and flavorful, each dish was super tiny. Amuse bouche was nothing to write home about, I can't even remember what it was. I loved the scallop sashimi but definitely would have liked to have more than one bite of it. The fish, pasta and venison courses were good with fish being my favorite, pasta - meh (I don't like whole wheat pasta but the sauce was good) and venison - great but I could have eaten three of them! On a plus side, vermouth mint palate cleanser was so yummy and the desserts were to die for, definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had! In general, I prefer more casual, bistro-type French restaurants like Gaslight. What I found sort of appalling is that Gaslight serves you a fresh warm baguette whereas bread at Craigie was cold and hard - oh the annoying little details! Do they get to you when you're dropping some $250+ for dinner ;) \\nWhat can I say? Check it out, it's definitely worth experiencing for a special occasion.

Yeah, the Andelman Brothers are annoying, and yeah, I rarely agree with the phantom's reviews, but whatever, this is how i spend my hungover Sunday mornings with my girlfriend. So effectively this yelp is a product of Fat Kid See, Fat Kid Do.  Who's pizza king of Cleveland Circle? My unbiased tastebuds at yo' service..\\n\\nThe test: To keep the environment as controlled as possibleI had a slice of cheese pizza from both Pino and Presto.  My wonderful assistant (read tolerant girlfriend) went in and bought slices and then put one of each in both boxes so I wouldn't know which was which.  This is serious business... Amed with napkins swiped from Boloco and a can of Pepsi, we walked over to the park to begin the 'testing'.   My method was pretty simple.... I took three bites of each, 2 from the cheesey part, and then one at the crust, and then a big gulp of soda; this was then repeated for the other slice in order to insure that both were sampled before they cooled off (It was windy out!).\\n\\nPlease note: The evaluation will be on the SSCCCG Scale (Yeah, I just came up with this): Size, Sauce, Crust: Edge and Crust: Pie wedge, Cost, Cheese, and finally, the Greasey Factor\\nSo now that it's clear that I have no life (which by in large is true) here are the results.... Noting that Size and Slice are negated as both were equally cheap and generous in size.\\n\\nSlice 1:\\n\\nSauce - Good, but a bit sweet; did not taste homemade, but unique\\nCrust: Edge - Soft in the middle but slight flakeiness, and a touch of cheweyness in the good way.  Light flavor with a hint of sweetness.\\nCrust: Pie wedge - Thin, flakey, but thick enough to maintain structural integrity for consumption.\\nCheese: High quality; light white in color and remains adhered to the slice very well though it is cheesey and stringy in consistancy.\\nGreasey Factor: Minimal Greezeynesss; a lighter slice to be sure.\\n\\nSlice 2:\\n\\nSauce: Heavier more authentic tasting spicey sauce; dark red and thick-ish consistancy\\nCrust: Edge: Crispy with slightly tough chew to it; dark and \\"crusty/crunchy\\".\\nCrust: Pie wedge: Medium/Thin, slighly chewey, good structural integrity\\nCheese: cooked longer and thus darker in appearance; stronger and heavier cheese that is bit through, not pulled apart.\\nGreasey Factor; not overtly greazzzey, but def. oily as a result of the heavier cheese combo used for this recipe.\\n\\nEvaluation: I'm at a loss here; even after 2 days of reflection, I haven't been able to make a clear cut decision on the \\"SUPERIOR SLICE\\" competition of 2008.  I feel like I'm being forced to compare and choose btw Manny and Big Papi.... One's a sure fire hall of famer- the other a clutch hero. How can you promote one with out discounting the other...This may be the most retarded quasi-competition/comparison I've ever partaken in...\\n\\nA few thoughts....\\n\\nSlice 1: This is the best pizza crust I think I've ever tasted. Chewey, but light and flakey.  A doughy flavor with a touch of flower and sweetness to it. It's honestly close to being the deal breaker it's so good...  BUT, there's a but... The sauce, is really borderline sub-par. Color was almost orangy and sweet, and really thin in consistancy. This wasn't noted in most bites as its masked by the cheese, but when getting close to the crust and you get a full sauce bite with no cheese... it was really notable. If you weren't doing a side by side comparison it wouldn't be so glaring, but when directly compared? Not even close to slice 2 sauce-wise.\\n\\nSlice 2: a heavier pizza; more similar to Regina's (Please note that this is not necessarily representative of a good thing), but not as cheesey and greezy. The sauce here is superior; spicey and a bit more intricate with a deeper, richer color. And the greasiness is at a good level- you can taste and see the grease, but you don't feel like a pimple faced teenager when you're done. The crust here is ok, but nothing memorable; the cheese is better, but not astounding in any way.\\n\\nSo which was which? Slice One, and my day time sober cheese slice selection: PRESTO!\\n\\nDespite the subpar sauce, the crust here was almost the best I've ever had; essentially it was like Ernesto's (my vote for best pizza in the city) but with bad sauce. A final thought: If I was craving pizza at 2am after pounding 30 beers at a Tailgate or one of hte local watering holes, I think i'd prefer the take at Pino's. It's heavier and more satisfying to the fat kids tummy factor.  That and the fact that Pino's vintage blinking sign would be really entertaining when you are wasted. Although the random tree growing inside Presto's is pretty cool too. The debate continues....\\n\\nOK, thats the worlds longest review.

I had been to their sister restaurant, Funky Monkey, and although I didn't have a fantastic experience, it wasn't memorably bad either. Regardless, I wanted a burger and trying somewhere new seemed like a good idea at the time. \\n\\nDespite being empty and having two servers assigned to me, the service was terrible. There were long bouts where I was left wondering if they had forgotten about me, or if I would ever get my food. I got the impression that there was some sort of training session going on, but that isn't really an excuse for bad service.\\n\\nI started with the \\"house special\\" which was a deep fried goat cheese patty with some sun dried tomato puree (Funky Monkey Fried Goat Cheese). The goat cheese was actually pretty good despite the fact that the crostones it was served with were burned and/or stale, it was difficult to tell. I don't know if it was even the fact that the bread wasn't prepared well or that it didn't seem fresh, it was that it was so hard that I had a hard time biting into it at all and that the edges were so sharp that my mouth was left cut, bleeding  and raw. Not exactly the type of dining experience I strive for.\\n\\nThe whole reason I frequented bananas was for a burger. I love hamburgers and am always looking for the next great burger in town. One of my servers suggsted the special, which was a \\"stuffed burger.\\" This particular night the burger was stuffed with blue cheese and bacon. It sounded good, I ordered it medium rare (most diners overcook a burger by at least one temperture). When the burger came out it looked and tasted as though it had been left in a deep fryer and forgotten. It was easily the worst hamburger I had ever had. It didn't help that it cost me $9. \\n\\nThe one saving grace was that with the check came a little stick of banana flavored cotton candy. It was a nice touch that added some playfulness to the experience, but it wasn't enough to make me want to ever go back.\\n\\nIf you ever feel like a hamburger you're better off visiting somewhere else in orlando. Try Mary's, Graffiti, Ravenous Pig, 5 guys, or just about anywhere else (yes, this includes McDonalds)."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A great place to have a casual lunch.

An art gallery and a restaurant? Um. Okay. The last time I went to something hybridy, we ended up at a Michelin-starred vegetarian place in Napa that was also a yoga studio and we were served a \\"dirt salad\\" on what was definitely a roofing slate. Thus, I was appropriately suspicious when a girlfriend alerted me of LAH's concept...and while I'm still weirded out that they hand you a wine list, dinner menu, and an ART MENU....our meal was actually tasty and we had a lovely evening...I may have fallen asleep at the table, but that is a different issue and not at all reflective of my enjoyment of the place. \\n\\nDon't go in expecting warmth - it still exudes \\"converted factory filled with all sorts of weird curios\\" - exemplified by our greeters...which were several nudie mannequins that had been painted in Kusama-esque patterns and some graffiti street-art done behind the bar - and before we even really had time to process, we were led into the dining room and handed the aforementioned power trio of menus.\\n\\nPluses:\\nStarted with Faroe Islands gravalax and a red quinoa salad - I can honestly say this is some of the best gravlax I've encountered - perfectly salty, balanced by delicate beets and baby fennel - and the quinoa salad also got high marks, though they ruin a perfectly good vegetarian dish with ham....which is confusing to me. \\n\\nThen hit the scallops w cauli/labneh and halibut w clams/shrooms/broccolini - all prepared with intention and an eye for presentation. The type of dishes were there are lots of dots of sauces on a plate and creating the perfect bite is both an adventure and a disruption of carefully engineered order. \\n\\nOh, our coconut rice pudding with ash-lime sorbet was a dream - the pudding was a little leaden, but the flavors were exceptional.\\n\\nPortions were ample - with a starter and an entree you'll definitely be stuffed. First courses are $12-17, entrees are $25-48, and I think our dessert was around $12.

Despite the innocuously weird vibe due to their gallery aspirations, I would actually take my parents here - a little dark, sure, but not too loud and with a solid menu of seafood, poultry, meats, and veg that literally anyone will be able to look at the menu and find something that sounds interesting."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Conclusion:  Definitely make the trip but make sure you're packing an extra artery and a hankering for salty food.  5/5 for the cured meats.  4/5 for the rest.  I can't quite give it a 5/5 overall so I guess we're rounding down.\\n\\nSetting:  Somewhat of an industrial feel to the place.  Almost like a factory heavily converted into a restaurant.  Nice ambiance, slightly cramped table placement, and it overall feels quite trendy and hip.  \\n\\nPresentation:  The charcuterie platter (cure meats like prosciutto, soppresata, salami, etc.) was served on a plank of wood that reminded me of a cutting board.  Our sandwiches were served on normal looking plates and the presentation wasn't out of the ordinary (they're sandwiches afterall).  Presentation of the food was average to good overall.\\n\\nFood:  Oh man, the cured meats were delicious.  We had one of the charcuterie platters (there's some debate as to which one we were actually served but for the record we ordered the Ossabaw).  The crostini was lightly toasted, the pear/apple (in my sodium filled delirium, I don't recall which it was) was a welcome sugary intermission of the cured meat-fest, and the salad served with it made you feel just a teensy bit better about all the saturated fat you're eating.  I had a chicken salad sandwich afterwards but to tell the truth, after the cured meats, I couldn't really taste anything, so the sandwich seemed bland.  \\n\\nService:  Service was good although I found it slightly odd that while a waitress took our order and came to refill our water, it was the hostess that delivered our food.  Not that I'm complaining but just a odd dynamic.  \\n\\nPrice:  The price of the cured meats and sandwiches strike me as normal for Boston's back bay.  Between two people, I'd expect to spend 40-60 dollars on a meal.  We definitely over ordered and could have done with one fewer sandwiches."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Numerous Irish beers on tap, authentic food and Irish dancers entertaining all night.

But something changed when the founders died. There is now mayonnaise in the potato salad and the cold slaw which ruined it.  I used to LOVE Salt Lick because of the sides, now I don't like the sides much at all.  It was wonderful to have one BBQ joint that didn't use mayo.  I think Mayo is unAmerican with BBQ.  I'm native Texan don't mayo my coleslaw. Another con is the meat can be inconsistent.  It seems like they must try meat from other vendors once in awhile and the meat is really fatty, but most of the time it is good. The sausage has an excellent flavor, but is it never cooked enough anymore. \\n\\nSalt Lick used to be AWESOME.  It is shame for so many cons to knock it from a 5 star restaurant. With the new competition in Dripping Springs with Stiles Switch BBQ in town Salt Lick will have to work harder. Stiles sides are better and meat quality so far has been better.

Again arriving shortly after the doors opened on a Saturday my first impression of Flour was that it felt corporate - like a regional Panera with its polished fast paced service and seats filled with both families and business folk alike.  With this idea noted, my next impressions were of the goods themselves as I stood aside assessing the options while patron after patron moved with the ebb and flow of the line.\\nWith selections made and coffee poured, a somewhat astringent fair trade blend I wouldn't particularly recommend, I found a seat and began first with my traditional choice - an Almond Croissant that would turn out to be not only the most authentic I'd taste in Boston, but also the best with a golden shell that shattered on mastication and a fluffy interior lightly sweetened and subtly kissed with Frangipane.  While perhaps not as good as the \\"average\\" in Paris, this warm bite was amongst the five best I've had to date in the United States, though admittedly the fact that it had just emerged from the oven may have had something to do with that.\\n\\nFor my other options, one eaten en route back to the center and the other eaten during a lecture later, I selected Flour's much revered \\"weekend only\\" sticky bun and a hefty chunk of their admittedly unattractive Chocolate banana bread pudding.  Beginning first with the sticky bun - my best advice would be to get extra napkins and a fork if you're going to go at it warm.  Dense, soft, and buried under a mountain of salty caramel and crunchy walnuts the most impressive characteristic was actually that something so sweet could also be subtle with yeasty notes balancing the butter and the toasty walnuts preventing the caramel from being cloying.\\n\\nWith the first two options so good it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the bread pudding - my favorite style of dessert - but unfortunately it would be a bit of a letdown.  Bearing in mind that this particular iteration was pre-made and served cold when I generally prefer my bread pudding hot from the oven, the biggest issue in my disappointment was actually that the chocolate was too dark for the quality of the bananas and the bread too absorbent for the amount of cream - in other words, I might as well have been eating a dense chocolate cake as opposed to bread pudding made with chocolate and bananas.  Now, keep in mind that for a chocolate cake this was a pretty darned good one - it just wasn't what I expected when I ordered bread pudding."},{"name":"Volare Restaurant and Bar","address":"388 Broadway","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Great food , excellent service, friendly atmosphere made us quite comfortable while we enjoyed a fantastically delicious meal with plenty left over  to take home and enjoy later?"},{"name":"Austin's Pizza Guadalupe","address":"2324 Guadalupe","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My experience sucked.

My meal sort of started with a low, i chose the Winter Pt. oysters as my app, and they were actually too big, making it very difficult to swallow, i thought i was going to get one stuck in my throat, and they were missing the standard brininess of an oyster.  As well i didn't like the mignonette that accompanied it.  My sis had probably the best plate from our entire trip, it was the tuna sashimi with watermelon and crispy basil.  The presentation was gorgeous, with the watermelon and tuna being similar colours.  The whole dish was just very clean tasting,  the additional of the crispy basil gave it some texture, it tasted like something you would get in a Japanese restaurant.\\n\\n  For my next course i had the grilled octopus with chorizo, cipolinnis and hearts of palm.  The meat was of perfect texture, i love the sweetness from the onions, with the smokiness of the chorizo, it was well balanced.

There was actually too much soup though, since we ordered three courses, a smaller sized bowl would have been sufficient.  Lastly we tried the crispy pig tails with pickled peanuts and onion rings.

When I think of baked pasta dishes, I crave the crusty, cheesy edges of a skillet dish; while the top was this way, there was too much sauce and thus the pasta did not crisp up on the bottom or edges as you'd like.  The risotto was just too rich.  The truffle oil was certainly not used sparingly and in combination with rich porcini mushrooms and pancetta, there was just too much heft to it.  Could've really used an acid instead of one of those \\"umami\\" flavors to lighten it, particularly as a summer dish.\\n- We put in a reservation for 6, got there on time, then promptly received a buzzer like we had been a walk in and waited 20-30 minutes.  When we got in, we were then asked to move tables because that table \\"was reserved\\" - huh?

It's not too spicy but enough to make you enjoy it and provide contrast to the other dishes on your plate\\n* Anything with pork: the pork dishes here, especially the pork shoulder and tofu skins are well prepared and stewed in soy sauce. Very traditional dish in my opinion.\\n* Clams: this can have some sand in the clams every once in a while, but overall solid.  Black bean sauce if I recall correctly.\\n* Mei fun: well-seasoned, texture is right.  Better than the white rice imo.\\n* Tofu with wood ear fungus: tofu is soft and overall tasty dish\\n\\nTo Avoid\\n* General Gao's/ Orange Chicken: meat is of the mystery variety, and typically has a lot of the breading.  Taste is not bad, however, but is not my cup of tea\\n* Soup: watered-down salty water.  Essentially empty carbs\\n* Fish: not terribly well-prepared.\\n\\nOverall, it's a solid place and comes at a great price.  If you are looking to take-out and primarily want something filling and quick, this fits the bill.  You have to be willing to alter expectations and experiment a little bit to find your place here, but I definitely will and continue to go to this spot again.  For what it is, definitely at the top of its class."},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Holy Shit! This is great!

I was actually pretty willing to overlook the minimal service and the okay ramen, but the worse part was when the bill came (around 60 USD for 4 people) and they told us the place was cash only. Maybe there were signs or something (I personally saw none) but it was kind of a bad ending to a mediocre meal. The ramen here is not cheap - albeit not entirely unreasonable - and it's a pretty well known name in a trendy place. To not accept cards at all will only deter potential customers and inconvenience people who actually come. Which doesn't seem to be that many.\\n\\nI've never had the chance to go to the NY branch, which is a pity since this one was fairly lacking. So, I was surprised that there was no line. We were seated quickly and serviced by someone new. At least, he seemed new. He forgot the drinks until we reminded him and  we got value added extras in the shape of a fly in our water and a missing egg in one of the ramens. \\n\\nThe ramen itself was okay. I got extra spicy ramen which denotes its spiciness level as 10 chili peppers. The spicy oil was flavorful but diluted to next to nothing in the oddly creamy broth. I wasn't expecting to be wowed with the spiciness but it was disappointing that it wasn't really spicy at all. The portion size was decent for noodles, but small for typical ramen places. \\n\\nI left full but not entirely satisfied.

A thin but amazing tomato sauce full of flavor and tasty toppings especially the mozzarella.  This is a food truck,  so its too bad nobody really gets to eat this pizza as it should be eaten,  unless you eat it in the car. What I did, which I have to say worked perfectly,  is heat a cast iron frying pan over medium heat for at least 10 mins to pre heat it well. Turn on the broiler in your oven.  Spray or wipe a little film of oil in the pan and let it start smoking,  then place a couple slices in the frying pan.  It will sizzle and you only need 30 seconds,  then slide the whole frying pan into the oven with the pizza and broil for less than a minute,  It was out of this world.

Pambiche is wonderful in every aspect, from their great location on NE 28th/Glisan, to their large outdoor seating selection, to their undoubtedly authentic food.  You can't miss this place when you find it - it is the bright, multi-colored building on the corner.  It should be noted that they DO NOT take reservations, and if it is too cold to sit at the outside tables (they do have heat lamps above each table, although I couldn't enjoy my meal that way) you should plan to wait a while.  The extremely small interior matches the vibrancy of the exterior, with colorful walls/tables/artwork, and fits only around 8 tables.  We were a party of 4 on a Friday night, and I believe we waited about an hour by the time we were seated.  On the upside, you can order drinks outside and huddle under the heat lamp towers, so we started with Sangria (very fruity, with pears being the dominant flavor, too sweet for more than one) and XX (light and drinkable, great compliment to the heavy dishes).  By the time we sat down we all had plenty of time to review the fabulous menu of starters, entrees, deserts and of course, coffee!  Here are our selections with feedback:\\n\\nRabo Encendido - this ox tail dish tasted almost like pot roast, and the meat fell right off the bone, phenomenal seasoning\\nVaca Frita - shredded beef served with all the fixings plus maduros (fried plantains) - need I say more?\\nPlato Cubano - pork was cooked to perfection, tender and moist, served with yuca con mojo - amazing! \\nRopa vieja - another shredded beef dish, but with a deep garlic flare\\n\\nAlso noteworthy is that you can substitute brown rice for white rice for only $1, for me this was greatly appreciated.\\n\\nDesert/coffee gets its own section because it is that delicious.  The decadent desert choices are visible through their display case in the dining room, so while you are reviewing the menu you can see all of your options.  My boyfriend recommended the Tres Leche cake...I knew there was a reason I liked him!  This is a little slice of heaven, I kid you not.

However my visit yesterday made the exception.  \\n\\nTypically they have a pretty nice staff who know what its doing but apparently they ended up hiring a bunch of teenagers who've likely never had a job before.  I don't have any problem with high schoolers trying to get a job after school- I'm a recent HS grad and I knew a bunch of people who've worked in similar positions at the nearby Chipotle and Panera.  \\n\\nTo begin, the six or so teen workers behind the register were having a conversation while we and some others behind us waited by the register to order.  After about a minute of standing awkwardly and failing to catch the attention of any of the staff a notably older staff member drew the attention of one of the teens to take out order.  \\n\\nSo I don't have an allergy to mushrooms but I can't eat them- their flavor makes me throw up.  I asked to get the Penne Rosa without the mushrooms while my mom got the spaghetti with shrimp.  We ordered togo and after an abnormal 6-7 minutes of waiting (from out experience their togo was fairly prompt) we tooked over beyond the counter and saw one of the teen workers literally pecking out something out of a pan with tongs.  Oh and at this point the conversation between the workers turned into some argument or something.  People were laughing, yelling, idk.  Just being unprofessional.  I think I heard a \\"Can't we all get along\\" in the midst of the mess.  By then I didn't really think anything of the pan thing and once we finally got our food we just wanted to leave.  \\n\\nForwards 10 minutes back at home and what do you know my Penne has bits of mushrooms in it..  Not enough to expect it to be in the dish but enough to verify that it was this that was sieved through by the tongs (unsuccessfully).  Not wanting to bother going back out and complaining, I just cooked my own food.  \\n\\nAside from that-\\n \\nThis chain used to be great.  Though giving small portions the food was tasty and prepared well.  Now it seems that little effort goes into their service and their food.  They're just hiring anyone to work there and the quality of their dishes has notably decreased since their original location's opening.

It was a creamy, delicious, orangy vanilla delight in my mouth. I chose to believe that I was only consuming 8 calories per ounce because I had myself a heaping cup of it. This was after I devoured my qualifying purchase of a tuna melt sandwich (in order to get the free yogurt).\\n\\nTo my surprise the tuna melt was pretty magnificent in it's own right. You get a choice of bread (wheat, sourdough, or jalapeno cheddar)..I went with the jalapeno cheddar bread. It proved to be the clear winner's choice for this sandwich. It kind of reminded me of Hawaiian bread with a slight spicy/sweet flavor to it. The fillings included tuna, swiss, avocado, chipotle mayo, onions, tomatoes, and sprouts. Oh my was it pleasantly and surprisingly good. My breath however..after consumption, different story.\\n\\nSo my thanks go to Austin Fit, for providing me this little coupon.

It's all family-style seating, and most of the seats are actually in the kitchen, but you can see them making the dough and putting the pizzas together. And they're always playing awesome classic Italian favorites, and we even got to see one of the pizza guys dancing while he slipped pies into the oven. They have 3 stone ovens, and they're all named after Catholic saints, and have little saint statues perched on top of them.

Come hungry, leave happy."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"The Salt Lick is one of the country's most popular destinations for BBQ.  It's located a good 35-40 minute ride southwest of downtown Austin.  It's really out in the middle of nowhere, Texas (Driftwood).  I want to say it's still Texas Hill Country, especially since we drove up and down many hills to and from Austin.\\n\\nThe Salt Lick occupies a lot of land.  It was built on the owner's ranch in 1969.  In addition to BBQ, the Salt Lick also sells champagne, wine, and beer out of the \\"Salt Lick Cellars.\\"  The restaurant hosts many weddings/receptions and private event functions and its facilities are sufficiently equipped.  While they have cellars on-site, the restaurant itself is BYOB.\\n\\nThe restaurant is big and an incredibly busy place.  They have a huge waiting area outside filled with picnic tables and a small stage where musicians perform live music.  This outdoor area has a lemonade and popcorn stand with freshly squeezed lemonade and popped popcorn.  The small gift shop is also located outside.  You can purchase \\"Got Licked\\" t-shirts, BBQ sauces, and dry rubs.\\n\\nI came here with a group of 10 on Saturday afternoon, peak time, and we were seated in 15-20 minutes.  We dragged two coolers of (Lone Star) beer with us and started enjoying them on the patio before we were seated.  Very laid back, relaxed atmosphere.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is filled with picnic table after picnic table.  Near the entrance is the huge Salt Lick fire pit where they cook the meat.  It's massive and impressive.  They burn oak wood exclusively to prepare their meats.\\n\\nIf you want to fully experience the Salt Lick, order the $19.95 all-you-can-eat Family Style meal.  It comes with beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans, bread, pickles, and onions.  Everything comes out on large plates or in bowls so you can pass them around and grab whatever you want.  The plates you eat off of are those old school compartmentalized plates like they serve in cafeterias.\\n\\nAnother good option off the menu is the $13.95 Combo Plate which comes with your choice of two meats (beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, turkey) with coleslaw, potato salad, and baked beans.\\n\\nThe BBQ was great.  The sides not so much (disappointing actually).  I tried the beef brisket, sausage, and pork ribs.  I liked the ribs the best.  They weren't the type to \\"fall of the bone,\\" but they didn't need to be.  Outstanding, uniform flavor.  I cleaned off those ribs like there was no tomorrow.  The table came with two BBQ sauces, one sweet and one spicy.  I only used the sauces for the brisket.  The ribs and sausage were fine on their own.  The sausage was sliced into thick pieces for us.  It was exceptionally smoky and savory.  Very juicy too.  The brisket was a little bit salty and chewy, but still very good.  I'd order all three meats again.\\n\\nI love how the BBQ is served with a plate of sliced pickles and raw onion.  I really like pickles and onions, so I thought this was a great idea.  More BBQ joints should adopt this.  The pickles and onion were fresh, crisp, and pungent.  Terrific complements to the rich BBQ.\\n\\nOur table ate two loaves of white bread topped with sesame seeds.  It was soft and freshly baked.  I was let down by the slaw, potato salad, and beans.  All three were just not very appetizing.  The slaw was light and vinegar-based.  Very mild, so not much flavor.  The cabbage was shredded into long strands.  The potato salad and beans were cold and thick.  The beans weren't that much better than a can of baked beans at the grocery store.  We were a hungry bunch, but still, none of us bothered to finish the sides.\\n\\nThe shortcomings in the side items were overshadowed by the amazing BBQ, so I'm still going to give this place five stars.  If you're in Austin and want to try some great BBQ, it's worth the drive to the Salt Lick.  It's an authentic Texas experience.\\n\\nGood service.

But that's about where my \\"pro's\\" end.\\n\\nMost important on my list of complaints, it is not a place really worried about whether you have a good dining experience.  Long, long, long waits for tables, and after that sometimes three hour wait, they might seat you next to complete strangers on the same picnic table so they can maximize their profits.  When I'm on a date night, or I'm going with a friend, last thing I want is to be paired off with some other people who are basically listening in to our conversation because they have no choice.

I get it, popular place on a Saturday night, no judgment.\\n\\nWe decided on the 8-course Ultimate Craigie tasting menu along with the three suggested wines (they don't do wine pairings) and away we went. Our first wine, a Riesling, accompanied the bread basket. The wine was fine and we were given mini baguettes and sourdough rolls, which would have been fine had they been warm. I understand they get bread from a local bakery, but at least make an effort not to serve cold bread. Our amuse was a trio of cold fish dishes - razor clam, salmon with jalapenos, and a smoked whitefish rillette. The clams didn't taste like anything, but the salmon had a nice texture and the jalapenos added subtle flavors without being overwhelming. I understand what Maws was trying to do with the whitefish, but unfortunately it wasn't better or even as good as smoked fish you get at any deli in New York. Forget New York, not even as good as the smoked fish at S&S in Inman. \\n\\nFirst course was a scallop crudo that was forgettable. Then came a pan roasted hake with a boudin puree. The boudin puree was disappointing and lacked the unctuousness and texture you would expect. Similarly, the only memorable thing about the fish was its rubbery, not at all crisp, skin. Homemade whole wheat noodles with sea urchin was just as mediocre as the previous courses. The noodles were overcooked, and the sea urchin roe was cooked by the heat of the noodles and lost its luxurious texture because I found it hard and almost chalky. Our second wine, a nice buttery red that I can't recall, accompanied the pasta. Great wine, but not a good pairing for the dish. \\n\\nThe fourth course was really the low point. Slow cooked trout collar in a chili sauce. When you hear chili sauce, you expect spicy and fragrant. What we got was a nice, tender piece of fish collar along with some red oil. It's like they gave us the watered-down PF Chang's version of a fish in Sichuan chili sauce. Seriously, go to Mulan or Mary Chang's and get their Sichuan fish - that's how it's supposed to taste. I was really excited to see pork belly as our next course, especially given how pork-centric the chef is known to be. The persimmon and turnip ragout was overly sweet and pork belly was overly salty. Also, my pieces of belly were tougher than I would have liked and lacked the nice layers of luscious fat. Our last wine, a great Shiraz, came somewhere here. \\n\\nThe last savory course, the trio of lamb that, which was actually presented by Tony Maws, was really the highlight. Sweetbreads, tongue, and loin, everything was spot-on, tender, meaty, and lamby as expected. Unfortunately, the lamb trio was followed by an apple celery sorbet with candied celery and homemade cheese. This was supposed to be a palate cleanser of sorts, but we really didn't get it since the celery bits were way too sweet, and the sorbet and cheese weren't good enough to stand on their own and definitely didn't work when eaten together. \\n\\nFor dessert, my date was given the butternut squash sorbet and whole wheat crepes with butterscotch filling, which was very good. I got the espresso, spearmint ice cream, and valrhona chocolate. The chocolate tasted like nothing and I didn't realize it was spearmint ice cream until my girlfriend recalled the server's description the next day. The espresso just overwhelmed everything and not in a good way. To wrap things up, a gift of spiced cider and homemade marshmallow from the kitchen with some chocolate macaroons. Macaroons were good and the marshmallow was airy, but the cider was overly sweet. \\n\\nIn all, the food at Craigie was inconsistent at best. I think my expectations were simply too high. Our most recent memorable tasting was at Hotel Sonnora, a 3 Michelin Star restaurant in Germany, and this paled in comparison. Instead, the preparation was heavy-handed, and the dishes that tried to creatively evoke familiar flavors simply fell flat (i.e., smoked fish rillette and chili trout collar). It's nice to read about restaurants that promote locally sourced ingredients, but unfortunately it felt almost gimmicky at Craigie. The menu did include a list of local purveyors, but no reference was ever made to the origins of the ingredients when our server was describing each dish. Coupled with the relatively steep cost ($350 for the pair of us), I have to say the place is just overrated. This might speak more to Boston not being a world-class food scene. Argue as much as you want, but there's a reason there aren't any Michelin stars in Boston."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great beer menu, and a very knowledgeable wait staff.

Perhaps the sushi side is more organized than the hibachi side, but regardless, we enjoyed every aspect of the meal.\\n\\nWe ordered the unagi, the crunchy roll, the super crunchy roll, some yakitori skewers, and the green tea creme brulee for dessert.  The price remains affordable and reasonable.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW FEB 2017: As hibachi style places go, Nakato is a decent choice.  I'm not going to give them a glowing review, but I'm not going to tarnish their image either.  We have actually dined here 2-3 times, but this latest time was on Valentine's Day.  When we arrived we were promptly seated at a almost-full hibachi table (which is great, because I hate being seated as the first party at a hibachi table).\\n\\nOur drink orders were taken swiftly as well, but after we had sipped a bit of green tea the table attendant (not the hibachi chef), filled our tea cup with soup broth... and it was not a pleasant flavor when mixed with the green tea.  They did apologize and correct the error, but at first the table attendant didn't want to believe we had just been served soup as a beverage.  The side salad and soup (the actual soup that comes with your hibachi meal) were standard hibachi quality.\\n\\nI got the hibachi scallops and my wife got the hibachi shrimp.  We felt that these were very good.  Interestingly, Nakato serves noodles (along with rice) when eating hibachi.  I don't think I've ever encountered another hibachi restaurant that does that... but it's a good wrinkle in their experience.  The veggies, rice, and noodles were great as well.\\n\\nI do think their prices are a little higher than most hibachi restaurants (many of which offer coupons), but I would be willing to go back to Nakato sometime soon."},{"name":"Brass Union","address":"70 Union Square","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Love the ambience for this place.

After all, he literally makes the smoothies by pedaling on a custom Schwinn stationary bike. I know people love a healthy drink before, during, and after a workout, but this is taking it to the next level.\\n\\nThere are a few different options for smoothies, juices, and protein shakes. Ryan will have whey, hemp, and a more vegetarian-friendly protein blend on hand.\\n\\nAll smoothies are $5.75. The \\"Moberi\\" has a nice blend of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, Greek yogurt, and agave. It's certainly more on the tart side, and the seeds from the berries add a texture that could turn away some people. Luckily, I'm not a picky person at all. Also, since I've basically gotten my sweet fill the previous few days elsewhere, having something like this was a welcome choice. The yogurt gives this a very slight creamy texture, but the fruits and ice remind me of the refreshing smoothie taste. I'm honestly not sure how much the agave necessarily attempts to sweeten this one.\\n\\nThe \\"Turtle Power\\" is a refreshing smoothie. Spinach and kale are responsible for the green color here, but you won't taste veggies. Instead, you'll get this sweet-tang effect from the apples, bananas, and mangoes. The ginger is a powerful aromatic counter, and while too much can turn away some people, my friends and I enjoyed this one. As a note, whenever I attempt to eat healthy at home, I end up making a spinach shake, so I'm very used to seeing a lovely shade of green in these circumstances.\\n\\n\\"Uncle Jesse\\" is another great choice. Avocado and coconut milk give this a creamier presence, much like a fruity shake. While the strawberries remain front and center, the mint adds a cool fragrant twist. Dates add a touch more sweetness.\\n\\nKids and adults should enjoy the DeLorean, a simple smoothie with strawberries, bananas, and mangoes. A nice tropical feel here.\\n\\nRyan will give you the option to make your own smoothie, too. Yup, if you missed your workout, you might be able to take a turn on the Schwinn!\\n\\nI can't wait to try the protein shakes that Ryan is planning to offer. \\"One Night in Bangkok\\" will feature sriracha and peanut butter.

The service on the bar side is excellent and I've never had a bad experience. Of course if you go as much as I do your recognized and treated well.

Across the river, we enjoyed a fine dining experience that hit all the right notes, but one: flavor.  It turns out that their vegan menu is the same as the regular option, but the meat is just left off the plate.  As the chef told us later on the tour, 'Oh, that dish is much better with the bacon.'\\n\\nDon't worry, across the Charles, at a restaurant known for its pig head and bone marrow, there's an outstanding vegan tasting menu.  You do have to give them two-days notice, but it's worth it. \\n\\nWe were warmly greeted and quickly seated in the stylish dining room.  The open kitchen is central to the restaurant just as the food is the star at Craigie.  The vegan menu is unique each night based on what's available, but I'll mention a few dishes to give an idea of what to expect.  \\n\\nOur meal started with a trio of amuse bouches, which included crispy brussel sprouts with green apple; kale salad with pickled garlic; and oyster mushrooms and tahini dressing.  Each was artfully presented and a hint of what was to come.\\n\\nAfter a hearts of palm dish, we were served carrots roasted and spiced with urfa.  I'm not the biggest carrot fan, but this preparation gave it a taste almost like like a roast and it was absolutely delicious!  \\n\\nOne of the cooks then came out and showed us the roasted cauliflower in its pot and then took it back to the kitchen to be sliced.  Cooked with savory chilies and savory granola, this dish was also outstanding.  \\n\\nA serving of beet pasta was fine, but we really enjoyed the yukon gold potato served atop forest mushrooms and turnip puree.  Roasted butternut squash and marfax beans was another pleasing course with black garlic vinaigrette, charred leeks and bok choy.  The bok coy didn't seem to fit, but it was otherwise quite tasty.  \\n\\nThe first dessert was lemon sorbet served over basil seeds, which served as a nice palate cleanser.  The orange blossom and mango dessert with citrus and carrot was truly exceptional. \\n\\nThe service was very friendly and not at all pretentious.  The staff was clearly knowledgeable about the food they were serving and were great about answering questions.  Also, the servings were nicely spaced, which is something other restaurants struggle with on occasion.  There were a few small things that raised eyebrows, but that didn't take away from the superb food.  At one point our waiter answered a question and said, 'But you probably would only care about that if you were a crazy Whole Foods person.'  Umm, at these prices, most people here are probably crazy Whole Foods people.  The birthday candle came out after dessert on a glass plate with our caramels, probably a bit of an afterthought.  If you're looking for wines by the glass, check the cocktail list. The wine list only includes bottles, so you might miss the by-the-glass option like we did.\\n\\nOh well, those are all very minor details and we were very happy with our experience and the hostess was particularly helpful.  It's only because she got us a printout of our servings that I remembered so many of the ingredients in our dishes.\\n\\nThe vegan tasting menu at Craigie is an excellent option for vegans and non-vegans alike.

That's to be expected and it was only about a 20 minute wait, so no complaints! \\n\\nWe started with the pork buns, which were not...worth...it. 2 pieces of char siu, the same type you get with your ramen, some mayo-based sauce and iceberg lettuce inside a flimsy bum. What? Who thought this would make for a good pork bun? Where's the thick slab of pork belly? What is iceberg lettuce doing in here? I don't even know what to say about the mayo...just no.\\n\\nThe Torched Tuna was ok...nothing special. Just lean pieces of lightly torched tuna accompanied by slices of avocado and some ginger and wasabi puree to season with. It was actually quite refreshing to have after eating the heavy ramen.\\n\\nThe chicken broth was interesting. I'm used to flavorful fatty pork broth, so I was relieved to see a very dense, concentrated and non-transparent chicken broth. Yet, it was a bit bland. Luckily I got the Extra Spicy Ramen with the extra spicy chili oil on the side. Chicken broth + spicy oil = instant flavor boom! It makes the broth x10 better and slightly addicting. It's not overwhelmingly \\"hot spicy\\" but more like a mellow \\"black pepper\\" burn. The noodles were thinner than I prefer but chewy and cooked perfectly al-dente. Fortunately, the char siu in my extra spicy ramen was tender and not dry like other reviewers mentioned. The added-on egg was overcooked and not worth getting. Non-runny eggs in ramen is just...sad face. His Mega meatlicious Ramen came with pulled pork, big pork belly chunks, and the regular char siu. Our favorite was the pork belly chunks and overall, the char siu was a good combination of fat, meat and char.\\n\\nService was ok. Another table that was sat after us got all of their food first. However, our waitress was very friendly and attentive. By the way, I dislike this no-take-home policy, which seems like the norm at ramen spots (Yume Wo Katare). Such a waste of food.\\n\\nThis might be TMI, but I woke up around 3am feeling incredibly sick and threw up...a LOT.

I am a sucker for good fried chicken so after being able to find the time I made the trek to Belmont one evening to enter the pod where Cackalack's is located. After walking around what seemed like a maze I find their food cart and quickly peruse their short menu. I ordered their chicken breast that comes with one side of either cole slaw or their cajun fries, texas toast, and pickle slices. In addition I also ordered some of their house made ranch dressing. After receiving my order I decided to take the order home and eat. Probably not the best idea but sometimes I enjoy the comfort of my home when I eat. \\n\\nI get home and opened up my sack to find the meal separated in two parts. The first part consisted of the fries and the second part consisted of the chicken, slices of pickles over the texas toast. The texas toast was not toasted which was a little disappointing. It was also soggy as a result of the transportation back to my house but I can't really blame them for that. I separated the bread from the chicken and proceeded to eat. The chicken I had ordered \\"hot\\" and I will say their heat level is exactly as stated. I had to use the ranch dressing to tone it down. It was spicy yet still very flavorful. The fries are drowned in their spices for that cajun flavor. Bear in mind I recollect someone mentioning that the fries were not crispy and I believe because the way these fries are cut you really can't make them all crispy unless you're looking for the shoe string fries crispiness which is not going to happen.  Their home made ranch is awesome and goes with the fries and the chicken well. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience there. I will definitely make a point to eat at the pod next time I order there and also I would like to make another trip just to order the jalapy which I have heard so much about. If you're even remotely a fan of fried chicken then you need to make a trip here and experience what this cart has to offer. \\n\\nHappy Eating Everyone...."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"We had an amazing time!!!

Every item has a different flavor you will not find elsewhere so right off the bat, it's easy to understand there are those that come to Salt Lick and stick to Salt Lick for THEIR BBQ. Furthermore, try BOTH sauces (hot and regular) unique to the restaurant and bring out a little something 'extra' in each meat you decide to try them with.  \\n\\nIf you are able to save room for dessert, be sure to grab a slice of their Texas Pecan Pie (pecan pie with chocolate chips) warmed with Blue Bell vanilla ice cream. You will not be disappointed. Wanna pass on pie? They do have Southern standbys like cobblers (berry and peach) if that is more along your fancy. \\n\\nGo whenever. Bring cash (or a debit card, ATM on site). Bring beer (if that's your thing). And by all means, bring an APPETITE!"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Coffee is fine.

BTW the Chille Verde was just like the other place so I wouldn't be surprised if they have the same owner."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Certified authentic and delicious!\\n\\nCame with a party of three after hearing that this place was great if you're serious about Indian food and their spiciness.  Arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night and there was a good number of parking spaces.  If all the spaces are taken up, there's still plenty of places to park across the street.\\n\\nThe interior is really cool.  The seating arrangement offers intimate interactions with dim and mesmerizing lights.  There's also a table with bags of spices right by the front door.  Barely a minute in and I'm hooked.  The three of us started with the garlic nan and the Kokam Curry and then ordered the Millionaire's Curry with Red Snapper, Biryani with Bone-in Goat, and Kheema Masala.  I mainly indulged in the Millionaire's Curry, but I took some bites from the other dishes as well.\\n\\nThe garlic nan was pretty good and the garlic was highly prevalent.  It wasn't spectacular, but better than that in other Indian restaurants.  This was my first time trying Kokam Curry, so I can't judge on its authenticity.  I admit the first sip was a bit bitter and turned me off, but the more I tried it the more refreshing it got.  I personally probably wouldn't order it again, but if you're not familiar with their food, you would either really like it or really don't.  People rave about their Kokam Curry, so definitely give it a try.\\n\\nMy Millionaire's Curry with Red Snapper was delicious!  There the line between tender and overcooked fish is paper thin, but my red snapper was super delicious and perfectly flaky.  The quantity of fish was also excellent.  The sauce was spicy even though I ordered mine mild, but the flavors were on point.  The biryani was pretty good as well and the goat was tender.  The lamb in the Kheema Masala had a lot of natural flavor and really surprised all of us.\\n\\nOverall, the flavors were great and the quantity was definitely enough for all of us and even had to take some of the biryani home.  The spiciness levels can get pretty intense, even for the veteran spice-eaters.  Each dish has its own inherent spiciness, so even when two dishes are both ordered mild, medium, hot, or desi-hot, it doesn't mean that they'll both have the same spiciness when you put it in your mouth.

This place came highly recommended as a \\"must eat\\" when in Austin. So, we drove around like confused Californians on the 290, and 71, and then some... until we found it. (The mini vineyard at the front was easy to spot.)\\n\\nPulling in, one can tell that this is definitely an experienced establishment. The rounds were manicured but rustic, and the service very very hospitable. We were seated straight away, in the group-dining-friendly benches that were VERY air conditioned. Props for offering diet Dr. Pepper and \\"house\\" wines (they just started making their own wines about a year ago).\\n\\nThe food: We went with the brisket, which was A-OK. Not spectacular, and actually a bit tough, which is unexpected for brisket. The meat is cooked over a large indoor smoky grill, so the quality was surprising given how we saw it cooked. The potato salad, though, and vinegary-sweet slaw was spot on -- not too rich, and light enough to allow room for the heavier meat. Baked beans were just meh. We liked the warm sesame Hawaiian bread and free pickles with white onions. BBQ sauce reminded me more of mustard than bbq, and it was sweeter than I preferred, but that's fine, I'm picky. Pretty good sized portions overall for lunch. We didnt' have room for dessert, but the slice of pie a la mode definitely appeared to be a meal of itself.\\n\\nAfterwards, we sauntered over to the tasting room for a $5/ 5 taste flight of their wines. Most of the white were sweet, but not as complex as i would've liked. The reds were also a bit too bold for my taste; the boy and I prefer more delicate reds like pinots. \\n\\nPerhaps we're just pretentious and spoiled; we've wine tasted and bbq'd along the central coast in Santa Barbara (like the movie Sideways), and all over Napa and Sonoma since we're Bay Area locals. Thus, this Texas place was good to see, just once, and we likely won't return.\\n\\nPS, in case it's not obvious, this isn't very vegetarian friendly and definitely not vegan friendly."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"The ribs were good but this food wasn't worth waiting 1.5 hours for.

Our server was Maxwell and he was very pleasant, the problem we had was the astronomical prices for the dinners for what we were served and the fact that there was only one type of each wine variety to have poured by the glass, so if you didn't like the one they chose for the menu, you were out of luck. My husband wanted red and I wanted white, neither of us wanted to commit to a bottle so we had to go with glass pours.

My husband had the Australian Lamb and I had the Pan Seared Scallops, both were $31 a plate. My husband was content with his overpriced meal, any other day of the week they only charge $27 for it. My scallops were room temperature so they must have been seared way before they were ordered and my plate consisted of 4 SCALLOPS.. at $31?

If there's anything in the world any restaurant would want its customers to say it's that statement right there.  \\n\\nChalk that up to a half dozen 6-course tasting menu extravaganzas (highly recommend this at the chef's table), a chef's whim dinner on a Sunday night, and a \\"hey lets just order some food\\" on another occasion.  \\n\\nI would break up the act of eating into a couple categories:\\n\\n1. I'm hungry, therefore I eat food.  \\n2. I'm hungry, but I don't want just anything.\\n3. I'm hungry and want a transformative experience through the act of nourishing my body.\\n\\nYou go to Craigie if you're seeking #3.  \\nIf you want a simple sashimi of dayboat scallops to give you goosebumps.\\nIf you think there's something inherently awesome about Chestnut Flour pasta tossed with a pig's foot ragout.\\nIf you want food that you can rave about for the rest of your life...dude, seriously to this day that \\"tongue & cheek\\" dish at my second 6-course was borderline life affirming.\\n\\nBut like anything great in life: moderation people.

This was a meet and greet with the 2011-12 men's basketball team, new head coach Brian Gregory, and former Yellow Jacket players (Duane Ferrell, James Forrest, Drew Barry, and Matt Harpring).  The event was held around the bar on the ground level.\\n\\nAfterwards, my friend and I stayed for dinner and the Brian Gregory radio show.  STATS will be the home of the Brian Gregory Call-In Show for the remainder of the season.  There are 10 shows remaining.  You can check out the schedule here: http://www.ramblinwreck.com/multimedia/geot-gregory-call-in.html.  The radio show takes place inside the \\"Kia Motors Studio\\" where 790 The Zone also occasionally broadcasts from.  Attendance to the Brian Gregory Call-In Show is free.\\n\\nWhile I'm on the topic of the radio show, I'd like to compare it to the Paul Johnson (Tech's football coach) radio show, which takes place at Hudson Grille in Midtown.  The Paul Johnson radio show has much better attendance, I think mainly for two reasons: (1) CPJ and Tech football are more popular and (2) Hudson Grille Midtown is a better location than STATS.\\n\\nAs for the radio show productions themselves, Hudson Grille does a better job because the sound of Wes Durham (the host) and Paul Johnson over the mics are fed directly into Hudson Grille's sound system.  At STATS, even though they are using the same equipment that 790 uses, the audio is out-of-sync and it is annoying.  There is a delay in what is being said live and what is heard over the speakers at STATS.  Many times, I had to look away from Wes and Coach Gregory just so I could focus on the audio and try to decipher what was being said.\\n\\nAlso, at Hudson Grille, it's easy to listen to what Wes and CPJ are saying.  The audio is loud and clear.  At STATS, the bar is so loud that it's hard to hear what Wes and Coach Gregory are saying.  I think I actually listened to maybe 25% of last night's broadcast.  I'm sad to say that it's better to just listen at home to the Brian Gregory show than to attend in person.\\n\\nAs for the bar and restaurant itself, I still think STATS is one of the coolest sports bars around.  Multiple levels and rooms with tons of TVs, fancier decor than the typical sports bar, beer taps at some of the tables, and a rooftop terrace with fire pit.  Coincidentally last night, the big wigs with the Chick-fil-A Bowl were conducting a meeting in one of the rooms upstairs to discuss which ACC and SEC teams they were going to select for this year's game.\\n\\nFood-wise, STATS' menu is simple with traditional bar food (soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, steaks, etc.).  The food is a tad pricey (e.g. a cheeseburger is $10), but you're also downtown and paying for all the great sports viewing.  I tried the guacamole starter ($9) and the tuna tataki salad ($13).\\n\\nThe guac was thick and fresh.  It had several big chunks of avocado in it.  The salsa was mild and a little bit runny.  When we started running out of tortilla chips, a server came by our table with a bowl of chips and refilled our plate.  Nice.  The tuna tataki salad was big and came with six large slices of raw tuna.  The fish was tender and not bad.  There was more than enough lettuce in the salad.\\n\\nSheldon was our server and he did a very good job.\\n\\nParking is validated by STATS for up to 3 hours with minimum purchase.  I don't know what the min. purchase amount is, but it can't be more than $10 or $20 (easy to hit with their prices).  The parking deck for STATS is right across the street.  This is the same parking deck the restaurants next door (Max's Coal Oven Pizzeria and Rise Sushi) use too.  It's clean, well-lit, and relatively new.

Since I was back visiting, might as well continue visiting the Orlando theme parks. We (me, husband, and a couple who used to have annual passes) went to both parks.  I wasn't sure what to expect from Universal. All I know is that I really, really, REALLY wanted to see Springfield and go on The Simpsons Ride. We braved the horrendous Florida heat to check it out.\\n\\nSpringfield was AMAZING. I'm not even that big a Simpsons fan, and I could've spent all day there. I found myself laughing through the entire Simpsons ride. (One tip, though: try to sit in front. The guy in front of me blocked a decent chunk of the screen with his big head.) We got Krusty burgers, which were surprisingly decent, I tried a Duff beer (very tasty, and made by a Florida brewery), and my husband got a Flaming Moe. It's just orange soda with dry ice, but you get to keep the very cool glass.\\n\\nThe rest of the park was pretty neat, too. Some of the areas really felt like you were in a Hollywood movie set. The San Francisco area wasn't exactly accurate, but I'm a snobby native. \\n\\nYou really can't compare Universal to Disney, unless you're talking customer service. IMO, Universal was much better than WDW in that respect. The bag check guy was courteous and friendly, unlike the people at WDW. And they only check your bag once, for the entire resort, which I really appreciated. Anyway, the other employees we encountered were also very friendly. The entire park was clean, too.\\n\\nWe had such a great time. I'd absolutely come back here. I need to get that huge Lard Lad donut, and I'd like to check out more of the park when I don't feel like I'm on fire. Same goes for Islands of Adventure, which I'll review separately.\\n\\nOne more tip: if you forgot to bring bottled water, get the souvenir cup for the Coke freestyle machines. You can fill that up as many times as you want, with water or whatever else you want. It'll save money on buying bottles of water. And this applies to both parks.

Also, the slight bitterness from the pork belly due to it having been char-ed kind of just detracted itself from the noodles and the broth.

There was some confusion about our reservation when we arrived, but the hostess and manager on duty were amazingly kind and helpful in sorting it out. When the answer was that our reservation was going to have to be delayed a few min, the round of free libations helped. In the meantime, the entire staff continued to be really attentive and extremely kind.\\n2.) I actually had a kick-ass martini here last night (my only complaint from my last post) Wohoo!\\n3.) The pig tails w/ cilantro jalapeno, etc., were delicious. The jalapeno really balanced the fat of the pig tail; an excellent starter. I can also recommend the brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat. If you don't think you like brussel sprouts or ever at them as a kid, definitely try these. you'll change your mind.\\n4.) The burger. I'm not a huge fan of this whole premium burger movement, to be honest, nor do I like to use superlatives in describing what can be subjective experiences so let me say this: the burger (available only at the bar, btw) was the best premium burger i've ever had. I could go on and on about how much i enjoyed it, but i won't. it's for you to decide. Just give yourself the opportunity to try it. \\n5.)

We thought the quasi late reservation would allow us to get right to a reserved table.  The table wasn't ready so we went to the downstairs bar to have a drink.  The bar area/floor was a huge puddle caused by something behind the bar that was leaking.  Employees had thrown about 50 cloth napkins on the ground instead of using a mop.  Not exactly 'classy' but not really a big deal either, other than creating less room to congregate.  We were able to grab some seats on the couches near the bar.  The bartender/waitress took our drink order after a few minutes of sitting ( we asked if we should order at the bar but were told someone would serve us).  Someone in our group ordered a glass of Cabernet, but was told that they didn't have any.  So they then ordered a Pinot.  When the waitress delivered the drinks she handed the glass of wine to our party and said \\"Cabernet?\\".  Sign of things to come.\\n Tick tock tick tock. Seated at our table shortly before 10 (9:15 reservation).  Menu looked great.  We were excited to eat.  We were also excited to order more drinks/wine as we finished our rounds downstairs before heading to the table.  We sat at the table for about 15 minutes before our waiter came- we had to grab a manager walking by and ask for them to send our server over.  No joke, the waiter says to us \\"would you guys like a drink while you wait?\\" (Ummmmmm we've been waiting pal).  We also let him know that since we had been sitting there for a while we were ready to order the first course.  In addition to ordering drinks and a bottle of wine, we ordered 4 apps for the table.\\n Expecting the drinks to come fairly quickly, we sat in deep anticipation.  We sat for a while.  Apparently, there is a separate area where the wine is stored and it takes several people to get it and bring it upstairs.  When the waiter presented the bottle, he gave us the wrong one- a cheaper one then we actually ordered (was he trying to give us a cheaper bottle and charge us for the more expensive one?) .  We sent it back.  Had to wait another couple minutes for the right bottle to get to the table.  We had been sitting at the table for over a half hour before we received our drink order.  At this time we ordered our entrees.  Ongoing joke at the table at this point was whether or not we'd have dinner before Saturday turned into Sunday.\\n We also discussed leaving at this point but at 1030 pm, what were our other dining options?  Decided to ride it out. \\n Apps arrived soon after.  Not a huge deal but when they brought out the apps, and the entrees later, they didn't place them on the table, they just handed them to us.  Like...here, take it.  Apps were decent.  Probably not as good in actuality due to the group being starving. Went online to try to look at the menu to remind me what we ordered, but there is no menu online.\\n We finished the apps fairly quickly.  They table was cleared and we waited for our entrees.  And waited. And waited. And waited.\\n Entrees came out, and for the most part, they were ok.  Someone had gnocchi, someone had fish, someone had osso buco.  Can't remember the 4th dish.  But I had ordered a pizza, thinking earlier that this would be hard to mess up and might come out fairly quickly.  The 4 entrees came out first and the pizza came out well later.  Told the group to go ahead and eat. Pizza came and it was pathetic.  I think it was just a digiorno pizza crust from the super market.  Definitely pre made.  No chance it was homemade dough.  Thoroughly under cooked.  I had one slice, one other member of our party had another, but over half the pie went untouched.\\n Around this time a manager looking fellow walked by.  He checked in on us and we politely made him aware of our experience thus far. Turns out he was one of the owners. He started off by explaining that they just started using open- table, but no one who worked at Mast actually knew how to use the reservation system, so that's why we were sat so much later then our reservation.  Ok...I guess?  He did apologize for the experience, said he'd comp us the second bottle of wine we had ordered, and would send us dessert on the house.  Once he left the table we discussed if we even wanted the dessert.  Tired and lazy, we stayed, anticipating grand cakes and tiramisu and gelato and cappuccinos and/or any other edible dessert.  A few minutes later, the manager delivers one of those digiorno pizza crusts I previously described with Nutella spread over top of it.  It was hilarious. It was also gross.\\nPaid the bill- which after drinks/wine/4 apps/5 entrees was hefty. We left a little after midnight.  A 3 hour dining experience that was expensive and miserable.  When we walked out, the owner and chef were smoking butts.  The sight of those two smoking right out the front door summed up the night"},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Teranga is conveniently located on the intersection of Washington and Mass Ave.  It's easily accessible by the #1 or CT1 bus. \\n\\nThe actual restaurant itself is small and quaint.

However, I didn't really mind because it just means that we were going to get seated more quickly.\\n\\nService:  The service, like other yelpers mentioned, isn't exactly fast.

I was warned that this would be a whole fish, from head to tail.  I told the waitress that this would impose no problem for me.   As a result, I received a HEFTY 1 pounder, at least.  At the price of $16, I'd declare this as the steal of a meal.  The meat was a bit overcooked.  However, it was still very flavorful.  I'd say that this dish would be a good alternative for folks who like to eat fish and aren't afraid of picking out bones.  \\n\\nOverall: I think the restaurant is a solid 3.5 stars.

Things I didn't think I would like (I like seafood in theory but rarely in fact), I loved.  I loved all of it.  We never wanted it to end.  If I had to pick a favorite, which would be difficult, it would be the rye tube pasta with the mushroom sauce.  It's nearly an eight-way tie however...everything was just amazing.  Never have had panna cotta that perfect in consistency and flavor.  I didn't know you could neutralize the stank of pate with chilled lobster.  The whole thing was totally worth the money, for sure.\\n\\nThe really special thing about this place is that it's not all stuffy and pretentious.  Even the layout is designed to be open and effortlessly cool; the first thing you encounter when you come in is the open kitchen where you can see everybody working and just marvel at it all.  We came in wearing jeans and didn't feel out of place at all, but neither did the more formally dressed.  All staff, from hostess to the guy opening the door when you leave, were super nice and friendly, and seemed genuinely so and not just faking it for the dollars.  Chef even came out to our table to discuss one dish and introduce himself, and he seemed really nice, cool, and welcoming.  Our waiter made great chit-chat with us, talking to us and joking about different wines and courses, which really made the experience fun as well as high end.  Yes, you can have it all!

It was like eating a typical French toast wrapped around a tiny cheesecake on the inside. The blueberry sauce was pretty good as well. I was able to sample the Nacho Plate. The nachos were decently good, chicken pieces inside were a little dry and the melted cheese was okay. Nachos were fairly crispy. I also sampled the \\"Mega Tots\\", which are these big crispy spheres made from potatoes. One plate has 3 pieces and the size of the spheres are about the same size of a medium-sized meatball. I thought the potatoes were tasty as well. My friend's cool friend seemed to enjoy the Tuna Melt Sandwich while my friend's dude friend seemed to have enjoyed the Belgian Waffle plate. However, he seemed disappointed in the sausages, since there were only 3 small pieces and mentioned the dryness in the taste. \\n\\nService was not great.

The menu changes frequently to reflect the best regional and seasonal ingredients. It is high end southern dining executed by a New York born chef who has been trained in southern cooking with a passion for finding the best ingredients in the area and traditional French cooking methods. \\n\\nTonight we started our evening with tempura goat cheese which was served with cracked black pepper and a honey drizzle. We are all lovers of ahi tuna so we tried their version which was served with saut√©ed garlic spinach in a spicy ponzu sauce. We all agreed the goat cheese was good but the ahi tuna which is such a pedestrian appetizer to begin with was surprisingly disappointing. It just didn't taste right. \\n\\nThe highlight of the whole evening was the soup du jour. Chicken and white bean chili with a smoky note.  It tasted nice and thick and so fresh with an absolutely rich and delicious taste. It would have benefited from a bit more heat (temperature) but it was a hit. The bread that was delivered with the soup literally looked like what you buy in that 12 pack of buns at the Publix bakery. I thought it was likely fresh bread but had absolutely no flavor. They could have done so much more with the bread and instead served basic white buns.\\n\\nFor dinner we ordered among the three of us two of their classic burgers with bacon jam, pimento cheese, fiery pickles, a fried green tomato and truffle fries along with one order of the seared scallops served with smashed potatoes with Madeira glazed wild mushrooms. My companions (Deb and Wolf) enjoyed the burger. I thought it tasted fine...not much better than anywhere else. Fries were okay. I enjoyed the scallops but my sister would have preferred them to be served hotter and with a better sear on them. After thinking about her input I have to agree.\\n\\nService was well attended and our server was quite pleasant. What was surprising given it was a fairly nice restaurant was the complete lack of knowledge of even of what was on the menu for wine much less the ability to offer any type of suggestion whatsoever. My sister had to take charge of that and ordered the best of what they had to offer. Nothing exciting on the wine menu but it served its purpose.\\n\\nThe menu tonight had other options such as roasted chicken, pork tenderloin, New York strip, red snapper and wild Atlantic cobia. We didn't partake on the desserts but the menu had a nice selection that included chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, bread pudding and an ice cream sandwich. \\n\\nWe really wanted to give this at least four stars because the proprietors seek to offer a high-end Southern dining experience...but it just misses the mark of being a stand out. I didn't find the menu particularly inspiring but my sister thought it was good.  I am probably being a bit too critical.\\n\\nIf you are in the area I would give it a try. It has more to offer than you will find in this area of town. We are hoping the owners will continue to refine their food and find a following.

The price was pretty good at $8 per person. Only negative is that there is no service. We had to fill our own water glasses. The one bathroom in the location was a little messy but considering it was the lunch time rush at a small buffet place then that is not too out of the ordinary.

Our server was very nice when we were first seated; brought us our drinks quickly.  Everything was fine until we finished our appetizers.  At first, we thought the kitchen was a little behind so we've decided not to say anything.  Waiting was still fine for us until we saw everyone around us started getting their food, what upset us the most was that the guests who were seated and ordered later than us got their entrees before us.\\n\\nWe didn't want to rush anyone considering it's dineout season so we continued to wait....  After waiting for another 15 minutes...my fianc√© and I thought something must have gone wrong with our order because we were the only table not getting our food; in total we've actually waited for 40 minutes.   Fiance decided to ask a busser to follow up on our order; he said he will go check for us.  The busser came back from the kitchen I believe but passed by our table without saying a word / update us.  \\n\\nSince our busser didn't do anything for us; my fianc√© had to speak to someone else to check on our order (think he's the manager) and took care of us from then on. not sure if the manager informed our server about the situation or not... , she finally dropped by to tell us our order will arrive soon...(really? after 40 minutes?)\\n\\nTo be honest, we're not picky with customer service as I also working in the same industry but it was impossible to not feel upset ..I felt that their customer service was really lacking because no one made the effort to apologize and inform us about the kitchen delays...,if they did we would be glad to wait. \\n\\nFinally, the manager brought us our entrees and tried explaining that our order was delayed due to some \\"problem with the mussel station\\".  Strange thing was, tables around us were getting their mussel entrees; yes including the guests who ordered way later than us...so we didn't understand what the problem was really.  \\n\\nAside from the disappointing customer service, I really enjoyed the food.  Fiance had the Soupe de Canard and I had the seared scallops for appetizers; they were delicious.  For entrees I order the Congolaise Moules Frites (a bit spicy for me but loved it!) and fianc√© ordered the trio de porch; he didn't like it so much because he thought the pork was a bit overcooked.  \\n\\nLuckily after finishing the entrees we didn't have to wait another 40 minutes for desserts...I had the Gateaux De Chevrela (cheesecake) and fianc√© had the Hazelnut praline chocolate mousse bar.  Both were really good so that made our night a bit better.  \\n\\nI really didn't want to write this review because I was expecting good customer service but it didn't go well as expected and affected our dining experience...however, the food was pretty good so we will still return and hopefully next time we will be taken care of."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"When I walked in I felt like I had arrived at an ATL hot spot that was in full swing.

Driving down Colonial Drive and seeing multiple Southeast Asian dining options, I thought, \\"Well, Sea Thai must be something if it stands out in such a saturated market.\\" \\nHaving dined there now, I DON'T GET IT.\\nWe were part of a party of seven. I can't imagine that that is an unmanageably large group, even for a small-ish restaurant, and I do not think we were a high maintenance group. In fact, our orders were all straightforward with no changes or substitutions. But plates arrived at varying times leaving some with food in front of us and others without. A drink order was entirely forgotten. Someone was missing silverware. Empty plates were left on the table for the duration of the meal! Refills and check-ins were non-existent! In other words, the service was appalling.\\nI cannot directly address the condition or taste of the food my fellow diners received because we were there celebrating a birthday and I did not want to be the one to ask if things were okay when I felt that they were not. I already felt guilty that Sea Thai had been my suggestion. \\nI can report that one of the members of our party sent his food back because it had tofu not chicken. It was returned fairly quickly but, seated next to me, it was my impression that the tofu was picked out and the chicken put in as it was simply sitting on top. \\nAs for my own meal, it was bad. Very bad. And I do not often simply use the term \\"bad.\\" I ordered the Spicy Eggplant with Seafood and received a pile of saut√©ed bell peppers with three or four small half slices of over-steamed eggplant. And it wasn't 'spicy,' it was 'hot.' Spicy, in my opinion, is a good deal of heat that is layered in with the other flavors of the dish. It may make your nose run, it may even make you need to take a little break from eating but it is, when all is said and done, about flavor. 'Hot,' just 'hot,' is an excuse for the kitchen to do nothing but pile on the chiles (flakes/ powder/sauce/whatever is probably least expensive) and do little else when it comes to flavor. So again, my food was 'hot' in the bad way and not 'spicy' in the good way. The 'seafood' consisted of four mussels, three shrimp and a few pieces of what I think I identified as squid or octopus. Very overcooked and rubbery squid or octopus. I did not eat any of this rubbery mystery cephalopod after my first bite and set it aside. The shrimp was fine. Three of the mussels were okay,... I hope. The fourth was closed and seeping some sort of fungal looking black stuff. I found this mussel later in the meal. Had I found it sooner, I would have stopped eating sooner and sent this plate back to the careless kitchen from which it came. Please see the attached photo. The discovery of this was the end of my meal. Who in any kitchen of any restaurant puts this on someone's plate?!? Disgusting. \\nIn fact, I will leave it at that. Service was atrocious.

The atmosphere is lovely (though time #1 we sat at a high-top table which doesn't feel fancy and was really loud) and the food is made from fine ingredients at a high price. The food really is quite good. The service is attentive (overly so at times with multiple servers coming to the table).\\n\\nHowever, I have a bunch of gripes. Mostly, I think this is a nice restaurant for people who want to feel like foodies but aren't actually foodies. It's fantastic if you've never been to Bondir, for example. \\n\\nThe first time we went, we gave some feedback via OpenTable, as we'd spent $400 for a dinner that we just weren't blown away by at all (we'd had the tasting menu) and it was frickin LOUD and we couldn't hear each other across the table. Craigie responded by sending us a $100 gift certificate which we used recently.\\n\\nOur second time was much better (we stuck to entrees), but I still left feeling very \\"meh\\" about it overall. \\n\\nHere are my gripes:\\n--the tastes don't match the price. if you're paying 100$+ for a tasting menu or 38$ for an entree, it should be excellent, with fine and interesting tastes.There are many other fancy restaurants in the Boston/Cambridge area that are half the price of Craigie, but better.\\n--Craigie uses certain ingredients and serves certain dishes to SEEM gourmet, not because they actually taste good (example: cow tongue, fish head, pig's head, etc.). I love weird food and am not a picky eater at all, but the menu always comes across as trying too hard, not genuine. \\n--The first time we went, we were served a fish head. This bugged me, not because fish head is gross, but because it's basically trash that they're trying to pass off as gourmet, and the nice little cheeky party of the fish head isn't worth it, and all I could think about was being at a seafood market in Korea and seeing piles of fish heads in the trash. I know it's dumb to be overly fixated on the fish head, but I am.\\n\\nAll in all, Craigie on Main is a \\"very good\\" restaurant with \\"very good\\" food, but it's not excellent or outstanding, and it's not a 5 star write home about experience. If the prices were a bit more reasonable, (like, say, maybe 25$ for an entree), it would be an excellent place that I'd recommend. I just think you leave thinking \\"I just spent $400 on that?\\"\\n\\nReally, we just weren't blown away by either visit to Craigie, and for the price--- I WANT TO BE BLOWN AWAY."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Start to finish, very enjoyable experience.

The scallops were perfectly cooked, and it all came together with limas, tomato, kale, crispy pork belly, white wine butter sauce.  \\n\\n  If all that wasn't good enough, we couldn't waste a bit of our free dining plan, so we each chose a dessert...Black Forest Kiss and Fluffy Lemon Clouds.  Husband ended up eating most of the Kiss, as it turned out to not be my fave...heavy on the cherry flavor (he liked), and slightly dry.  The lemon meringue tart was more my thing...more meringue than anything else, but light and tasty.\\n\\n    This turned out to be a wise and tasty use of our Disney dining dollars (as well of our \\"real\\" dollars).

The rice bowl came with 4 house made sauces, which were a tad salty, but still tasty, and the beef was so tender. The shrimp pancake I have to say was the most interesting- the pancake was sitting atop SPICY chili sauce, with the shrimp on top covered with a cooling, minty-based sauce.

It's about $23 with tax and comes with a large 3-topping pizza, 1/2 pound boneless wings, and breadsticks.  \\n\\nWhen I called in my order this place lost its first star before I even tried the product.  Three toppings means three toppings.  So if you get two toppings on half the pizza it counts and two whole toppings.  Every other pizza place I've ever eaten at in my life counts a half topping as half of a topping.  Paying full price for half of a topping isn't cool.  Anywhere else I could have ordered 1 whole topping and 4 half toppings no problem.  The guy taking my order said he couldn't do anything because the computer limited him.  Bummer for you.\\n\\nWe had the crust flavorized with Turbo Crust which is garlic, butter and romano.  This is unique the ability to pick the flavor of your crust but I think it's more of a dusting than a flavor.  The deep dish square pizza had thick bread and the crust mostly tasted like bread.  Toppings were decent and the sauce was thick and tasty, probably the best part of the pizza.  \\n\\nWings were about what you would expect from a pizza shop...not all that great.  We had the honey BBQ flavor and they tasted exactly like something you could get at a grocery store and reheat in a microwave.  No texture a crispness from deep frying found on these wings.\\n\\nThe breadsticks were decent as well.  Again my favorite part was the pizza sauce for dipping.  I think if they were a little thinner they would cook through more thoroughly and taste a bit better.  \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the topping fiasco/rip off this place would be a clear cut 4 for pizza and a 1 for wings.  My rating is based solely on the pizza which is clearly better than Massey's, Donato's, and my favorite chain Papa Johns, but not nearly as good as the Golden Standard that is Plank's Cafe on Parson's.

It didn't taste bad but I was expecting thin, crispy crust with a light and airy quality to it, which you typically find with good brick oven pizza (the kind where you can fold/hold the slice without it flopping over).  They also could have taken more time to distribute the cheese/toppings more evenly - some slices had large sections with either sauce only or dough only.  The pizza overall wasn't terrible but Not a good value at $25 per pie.  They do let you bring your own drinks - which I recommend because they charge $4-5 for a regular soda."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"My family came into Austin to visit for about a week and I really wanted to take them to the Salt Lick.

I was looking to get just a sampler meat type of plate, but when I found out it would have only one rib, then getting the All You Can Eat family style option was my choice, and believe me, it's the only way to go. Asked for Ribs, moist brisket, and sausage, offered burnt ends and are you kidding, of course!\\n\\nNext thing that showed up was a massive amount of food. Simple vinegar type fresh cut cole slaw, it was good, and I'm not a cole slaw guy at all. Beans were good, the potato salad was good, but different, I thought it seemed like it had been cooked some, it was served at room temp and was light brown, I dunno, not sure but like I said, pretty good. THE BREAD WAS GREAT FOR GOSH SAKES, what is going on here?\\n\\nOn one plate was a large amount of BBQ. Pork ribs, several slices of brisket and sausage. It was ALL very good. Two types of sauce, regular and a habanero, which I preferred, but to me, it still wasn't that hot at all. Both of them seemed to be a mustard type based sweet sauce, not my favorite, but still good. The sauce was the least favorite part, if that tells you anything.\\n\\nI managed to gorge down the first plate, everything on it very good, I expected more of a char taste from the burnt ends, but no biggie. I asked for a couple more ribs, ONE SLICE of the lean brisket, and a LITTLE MORE sausage. Of course that meant when I got the plate, it had three ribs, 3-4 slices of brisket, and a whole serving of the sausage again. Sheese. Had one slice of the brisket, not much for me there, nothing special, not a lean brisket guy anymore. Good, not my type. Ate a little more, got the rest to go.

Ask him where the best food is, and you will almost assuredly get an answer that involves the phrases \\"Its down that alley....,behind that building.....its downstairs....you can easily miss it\\". No, im not giving you directions to a shady drug-dealer, I'm showing you Potluck Cafe, which is on Knapp St in Chinatown...which looks and smells like any back alley. \\n\\nGo inside, and the place isn't too big. There is a long buffet table, and some odd tables and chairs that surround it. What is on the buffett table, though, is the star. Each day, there are over 25 menu items to choose from, from pork knuckles, to tofu, to chicken wings, to fried anchovies, and a whole manner of vegetable dishes and soups. The ordering process is simple: You pick 3 items from the long buffet, and its packaged up for you with rice and seaweed soup for only $5.50. That's right, only $5.50 per order...can you ask for any better value. \\n\\nWhenever I come in here, there are some items that I can't pass up. The pork knuckles in sweet and sour sauce are juicy, suculant, and addictive. The bean sprout dish is by the far the most original item on the menu, with sauteed pigs liver on top, always cooked perfectly (not bad for a dingy hole in the wall). The fried anchovies are golden brown, fried in a tempura batter, which gives it that nice crush, followed by the brininess of a whole anchovy. The peel and eat shrimp are the way I like it, heads still on so you can suck the brain right out (thats where all the good shrimp flavor is, which is what is used for shrimp stock). Of course there are chicken wings and pork spareribs for those less adventurous, but lets be serious, to eat lunch in a dark alleyway restaurant in Chinatown, you need a sense of adventure. \\n\\nThe seaweed soup is the biggest wildcard though, if you get the bottom of the pot, you have a nice cup of vegetable broth, salty and nutritious. If you get the top, you're esentially eating dishwater. Its free though, so its a worthy gamble.\\n\\nSo if you want the best lunch in Chinatown, get off of Kneeland Street, and head to this back alley, down that street, and behind that building."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My date and I visited this establishment on June 3rd as one of my birthday stops.

A close second was the bread soaked with rum with currants.  The pastry basket is fun to get and share.  The tostones (fried green plantains) were a tad dry, but still very yummy and the maduros (fried ripe plantains) are a must order.  The primera vuelta is MASSIVE.  No one would share with me, but I was undeterred.  You get two empanadas, two croquetas, two frituras, and three kinds of salad.  I picked the espinaca con queso (spinach, cheese) empanadas, bacalao con papa (codfish and potato) croquetas, and maiz (corn) frituras.  All very good.  The frituras were delicious - sweet like cream of corn soup.  I also snagged a black-eyed pea fritter off my friend's plate, which was also delicious.

I went for Sunday brunch with my two kids and a group of friends so between us we sampled a lot of food. I don't think anyone was disappointed. The biscuits, waffles, chicken, ham, greens, gravy, mac'n'cheese were all good and tasted freshly prepared. The only food item I took issue with were the tiny, hush puppy sized beignets. Beignets need to be bigger and square in my book but they were fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside and we aye them all so I guess I can't really complain. \\n\\nThe service was a whole other story. First, it wasn't very full when we got there but it took a while to get seated, and then when our waiter came to take drink orders (I second the pitcher of mimosas being a good deal, and would like to try the bloody mary) I was going to order for the kids at the same time, but our waiter disappeared before I could.  When he came back I ordered for the kids.....and then we waited and waited and waited.  Eventually the mac'n'cheese and beignets came out, and it was all delicious (albeit too hot for my kids to eat right away, which is usually a good thing) but my kids were crazy ravenous and after we all ordered (and waited, and waited) I had to get seconds for my bottomless pit 3yo.  Then once the food came out, it was pretty mixed up for anyone who got a side.  My husband got a side of chicken that came out ten minutes after the rest of the meal, a friend ordered a side of bacon at the server's suggestion and then had to ask him twice about it, and somehow we ended up with some extra biscuits.  A couple of our party were convention-goers who needed to get back and had asked right at the beginning for their checks to be brought with their meals, and they also had to anxiously keep asking about their checks and if we hadn't been literally across the street, they would have been late.  Once they left, we were sitting waiting for quite a while with no questions about whether we would like more drinks (I think the coffee drinkers got one refill...maybe...and given how hungry and tired my kids were, I think I could have drank another pitcher of mimosas myself) but someone came over and asked if they could clear that half (which was it's own table pushed with ours) but assured us they weren't trying to rush us out.  We all looked at each other.....clearly, because we were trying to rush OURSELVES out and weren't getting much help! Eventually my husband had to take the kids to the car while I settled the check because they just couldn't handle it anymore--and I don't blame them since lunch took two hours!  \\n\\nI realize that a bigger party is difficult, but I felt like we politely conveyed our priorities of getting the kids fed fast, enjoying our food, and then getting out the door before everyone melted down, and our server just wasn't picking up what we were putting down.  I definitely would think twice before taking my kids here again, even though they loved the food, because the slow service made it so hard to enjoy!  I feel like I do my part to have my kids well-behaved by ordering for them right away so they don't get bored and hungry, and then keep them entertained, but my server has to help me out!  I'm trying to avoid children melting down for all of our sakes! Surely this is a task you would like to aid me in!

And while the room might not have all the modern amenities i.e. TV the hotel makes up for it with live music in the basement nightly and 2 free movie tickets to a nearby by theatre. McMenamins also has their own brewed beer on tap which isn't bad and is also for purchase in growlers.

But try Gio's chicken and if you like spicy, get the diavola.  Don't limit yourself.  Or don't go next door.  I don't want it to get any busier.  How DO they get their chicken so fast and juicy (pressure cooked?)?\\nOnly complaint is that the pizza side sits on the chicken side and uses it whenever.  Had to listen to a bunch of men sitting up front near the register's on a weekday after eight cursing and being loud (downside of BYOB).  Cashiers probably didn't care or know what to do.  Also looked like no one is in charge so it was more flirty and had to see weird exchanges going on.  Eat your pizza on the pizza side or in your car if your going to curse.

Hubs and I love Four Square across the street (same owners) for a casual drink or light meal.  Food is great over there, service always friendly.  However, Trio was a huge disappointment.  We went the week or so after they opened, and everything was wrong.  We had to wait 15 minutes when we got there, even though there were plenty of (dirty) tables available.  I'd normally be OK with this if they were maybe understaffed, but waiters were chatting and on their cell phones at the far end of the bar, so I wasn't OK with that.  When we did finally sit down, we didn't get asked about drinks or given menus for another 10, then it took a solid 10 more before we got them delivered.  Next the food.. while I didn't have expectations for a 5 star restaurant, this was bad.  Crab cakes (waiter told us there were 3, but they only came with 2) were dry and super fishy, sandwiches were greasy but not flavorful.  They also only had one ketchup to share over the 5 tables up front, which seemed a bit off since they are brand new.  We were seated at a high top table by the window...again, seeing as this place is new, the stools shouldn't have been wobbling, but they were.  Hoping this was just 'first week glitches' we were gracious and tipped well, knowing we definitely weren't the only ones in the place unhappy with our experience and as a former bartender/waitress, know it's tough when customers aren't happy and take that out on your tips.  \\nWe also decided to give Trio another shot a couple weeks later, this time, only for drinks.  Again we dealt with the waiting game for a table when there were plenty, and the waitress mixed up our drink orders.  Cocktails were weak and they still hadn't fixed those darn wobbly tables!  I'm hoping that IF I ever go back, things are better.  In the mean time, Four Square is always a great time for a casual night, and Passport is a much better alternative in the area."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I had a great lunch here.

(Not always the case with gluten free). Service was ok. They got us our food in a timely manner but never checked back in. All the servers were running around and it seemed like there were not enough of them for the amount of customers present.

I was actually at Craigie for their opening, but wasn't there long enough to form an impression other than that the decor was a huge improvement over La Groceria's. That isn't really saying much, but I would say that Craigie on Main has one of the most attractive, modern dining areas that I've seen in the area, and their fully open kitchen does a lot for the atmosphere of the place.\\n\\nBut on to the food. Their menu is renewed daily based on whatever the best, freshest ingredients they can get that morning are. The menu last night, for example, had been printed at 5:08 pm that day (putting that info on the menu was, I thought, a nice touch). I decided to go with seafood and had the Spanish octopus with chorizo oil appetizer followed by the Irish Sea trout and finished off with the white corn grits dessert. The octopus was among the best I've ever had, and was certainly a dish where the attempt at ultimate freshness really shines through. It was completely not rubbery as you might expect from other octopus dishes you've eaten. In fact it was even more tender than I knew octopus was capable of being and had a fantastic texture to match (and I'm a big octopus fan). The same was true for the trout. It looked more like salmon than any trout that I've ever seen, but certainly tasted like the freshest trout you've ever had. It was lightly seasoned such that you thought you were eating it straight out of the sea, and was paired with equally delicious rock shrimp and mussels. The mussels, it's worth mentioning, were also the best I've ever had. In the past I've thought I didn't like mussels and so avoided them; I actually almost didn't order the trout because the menu said it was served with mussels, but I'm glad I did. As with everything else, they were so fresh, and so well prepared that the only word that can even come close to adequately describing them is delicious.\\n\\nThis is probably not a place that I would go for dinner often, but the quality of the food is so good and the prices, though high, so appropriate, that it's certainly been put at the top of the list of places to go for a nice night out. Having lived literally right around the corner from this place not too long ago, I can say that Craigis on Main is a fantastic addition and is definitely going to be doing its part to drag Central Square, kicking and screaming, into the realms of classiness."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I heard so much about The Salt Lick while planning for my Austin trip.

The snacks were unbeatable! Betal leaf  prawn that was bite size and a crispy edible rice bowl filled with creamy raw scallops and a coconut broth clam soup were my favorites of the 11 dishes.  I really could have stopped there because the rest of the dishes were tasty but not mind blowing.  There was a rice noodle snack wrapped  with meat as well as a beef thai tar tar and yellow tail salad which were also delightful.  The main entree did not entice us.  It was jasmine rice with smelt and calamari (which was not crunchy and feels like it's been sitting) the crab curry was spectacular and the prawn pickled egg lettuce wrap tasted like something I've had before.  The desserts were tasty but I was not shocked.  I guess I was expecting to have flavors meld where  I've never experienced  before.  I think being Vietnamese I've had my share of fish saucey dishes.

The chicken was very crispy and seasoned well and the biscuit was good too.  \\n\\nSince this was my first time ordering from them, I can see now that I ordered way too much food for one person. I ate one pancake and one biscuit sandwich and was full as their portion sizes are huge. \\n\\nWhen I came at 8 am, the restaurant was fairly empty, so that'd probably be a good time to come in if you plan on eating in the restaurant without having to wait. \\n\\nOverall the food was great and I will add this place to my favorite breakfast places in Atlanta."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The hubs and I went here after a game a couple of weeks ago at the recommendation of a friend from San Francisco who gives this place a huge thumbs up.\\n\\nWe were lucky to score an outdoor table on such a gorgeous day!

Well, I guess by my standards, and I am a Virginian. There are numerous other places in town where you can get a better pulled pork sandwich or a better rack of ribs.  However, with that said, you go to the salt lick for both the food and the experience, which is never disappointing when considered altogether.\\n\\nThere are the usual options of beef brisket, either by the sandwich or by the plate. You can get sides such as coleslaw, beans, and other fixings, which are also very good. They have barbecue chicken, beef brisket, and of course the world-famous Salt Lick ribs. These ribs are not your traditional slow-cooked ribs in the traditional Texas style. Instead, these are charcoal cooked ribs that definitely have a different taste, texture, and overall presentation. Don't get me wrong, the ribs at the Salt Lick are definitely good, especially when you pair them with their dry rub and their sauces. However, if you want traditional slow-cooked Memphis-style ribs, you are going to need to try a different barbecue venue.\\n\\nWhen it comes time to order, be ready. If you are slow with your choices, then the waiter will order for you... This usually means that you will be eating ribs. These waiters have been a mainstay at the Salt Lick for years and years, and they are part of the draw to this place.

It's somewhat entertaining, but for me, it's just a nice place to sit down and relax for a bit. Not a must-see.\\n\\n5) Disaster!: The beginning is a little slow, but the end is completely worth it. They take quite a few participants from the audience, so if you're up for that, make sure you make a lot of noise or wave frantically. They make you do really interesting stuff. A must-see!\\n\\n6) Fear Factor LIVE: If you like the show Fear Factor, then you'll most likely love this show. Depending on the contestants, you can have a really tight and fun competition to watch. I was lucky to get really good competitors on the show that I was watching. Another must-see! (PS: The casting is done 75 mins prior to each show)\\n\\n7) JAWS: MUST-SEE! What else can I say? Just hope you don't get an annoying narrator. This is a classic ride. You can't go to Universal Studios and not ride on Jaws.\\n\\n8) Men In Black Alien Attack: This is a fun ride. You sit in this little car thing and they spin you around like crazy while you're trying to shoot aliens down with the little laser guns. It's quite fun. And they say it's never the same ride twice! A must-ride!\\n\\n9) Animal Actors on Location!: Hmm...good for the kids, I suppose? It's entertaining enough for the adults too, but most likely this is just good for another rest from all the walking. Not a must-see.\\n\\n10) E.T. Adventure: Ride this just because E.T. is a classic if for no other reason. It's a decent ride.\\n\\nAnd I would say something about the Back to the Future ride, except that now it's been replaced by The Simpsons.

Ordered through GrubHub, and although it took 45 minutes, that was the estimated wait time from the start. Food wasn't cold either. Some might not like having to wait that long.\\n2) Food was cheap, not accounting for quality. Ordered Kung Pao Beef with egg roll and pork fried rice. Fairly large portion sizes.\\n3) Food was edible. This isn't saying much, but better than the opposing stance.\\n4) Ordering through GrubHub effectively sidesteps all the staff, minus the delivery man. He was good about calling ahead using the number I provided though, so that experience was pleasant.\\n\\nNow for the bad points.\\n1) The quality of the food. As you could guess from all the reviews here, this at best looks like Chinese. Pork fried rice was decently fried, but had little pork. Kung Pao Beef sauce was watery, and the beef itself was over-cooked and dry. Egg roll lacked eggs, and was unusually sweet, even without sauce.\\n2) Accounting for quality, it was overpriced. ~$7 for Kung Pao Beef + pork fried rice, $3 for egg roll. $2 delivery charge + tax + tip brought the order to $15. That's really too much to pay for food that terrible.\\n\\nThe bad points really outweigh the good here, and I personally don't see myself ever ordering from this place again. The only reason I placed the order to begin with is that GrubHub ratings of this place were inflated to 3 stars, and they (conveniently) didn't link their Nan Ling restaurant page with the Yelp review page, despite many other of GrubHub's restaurant pages being linked to their corresponding Yelp review pages.\\n\\nThere's better restaurants in Boston, even if it's late and you're starving.

Giving the 1-star so it will hopefully serve as a wake-up call to the owners.  Bar service is good - unless you are forced to interact with the non-smiling, hostile bartender who seems inconvenienced.  Table service here is horrendously bad.  By \\"bad\\" I mean \\"nonexistent\\".  The room seems severely understaffed at all times.  Whoever is managing this place is clueless (anyone in restaurant management knows that more servers per guest = happier guests, higher tabs, higher tips and more profits; so it is sad to see a place so clueless to think that skimping on servers is a great way to cut costs).  I'm not joking;  the few servers on the floor are so under the gun that they walk by your table and avoid eye contact - if they walk by your table at all.  So lame.  Easily the worst service I've experienced in Portland.  I'd say today it was about 1 server to 25+ guests.  I feel sorry for the servers actually.   Came in a little while ago, sat at a table for 10 minutes, chatting, before I realized that nobody had been by.   So, like usual, I had to get up, walk to bar to get the beers and bring them back to the table.   Still no server.  Nursed the beers for 20 minutes, and still no server, no menu, nothing.  Finished the beers, and we were hungry, and we wanted diner but had to leave on principle.  What a waste of a great room and great location.  It is a real shame.  Blitz has so much potential.  \\n\\nOWNERS:   Pull your head out and fire the managers ASAP, please!  You probably need to clean house on your staff, too, because any server who sticks around in such a demoralizing environment/culture of poor service is probably an underachiever  who could not get a job at a real restaurant. \\n\\nAfter this last experience, Blitz Ladd has officially been added to my \\"avoid unless desperate\\" list.  There are just way to many great places in Portland.  And it is sad, because Blitz Ladd has a great selection of beers,  and shuffleboard is very cool, too.   But TERRIBLE service kills the place."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I ENJOYED this place, but if you ask my friends the service was TERRIBLE. I did not necessarily agree so I will leave those details off. The parking situation here was also NOT THE BEST. The restaurant is located on a busy street with a small parking lot. Not to mention, naan doesn't come out complimentary with dishes. What is that?! We came here on a Friday night and did not have to wait for a table, nor was it very busy.\\n\\nTandoori Chicken - I wanted the Tandoori chicken and it was denoted on the menu to allow 30 minutes for it to be prepared. So I had my order put in before my friends. In hindsight I should not have done this because I got my chicken a 20+ minutes before my friends all got their food. SOOOO not quite sure why they encouraged people to order the Tandoori Chicken ahead of time. I would order this again, but maybe not over other dishes. (See below). The dish comes out on a iron skillet with onions and cucumbers. It also comes with a side of rice and some yellow potato-ey side dish that was pretty bland. You'll have to excuse me, I forget what it was called. The chicken was less tandoori- tasting than I would have liked and was a little under cooked (2 bits of pink/bloody areas). (The dish comes with two (2) pieces of chicken.) But overall, it wasn't a bad dish. \\n\\nTikka Masala - The best dish I have tried there. You can have it with chicken, some kind of hard cheese, or other meats; as its an option for all of their dishes. There weren't very many chicken pieces and more just soup than anything. There were limited slices of onion in it as well and could have had more. \\n\\nCoconut Curry - I don't recall the actual name of this dish but that is what it was. I liked it and don't get me wrong I do like strong Indian flavors... but this dish might have been too spiced in my opinion. A friend of mine who likes overally spiced dishes (in my opinion) thought it was only \\"okay.\\" In comparison to my dish, it was better in the sense that it had more flavor. But I was able to finish my Tandoori Chicken, when I wouldn't have been able to finish this dish. \\n\\nNaan stuffed with lamb - For $3 it was a good deal. My friend liked this the best out of all of the dishes. I would order this again. But the whole naan itself doesn't hold well with the stuffing. It kind of just crumbles. \\n\\nGarlic naan - If you're considering ordering this, then I would already go ahead and order it. It's hard to eat some dishes without naan. They should really just include it with every dish. \\n\\nAdditional notes - Friend thought the hard cheese (vegetarian option for a dish) was terrible.

It's barely more than a tiny serving area and a counter where you can stand up to eat. That really didn't matter to us.

And even though there can be a pretty long line at lunch-time, the service is fast and efficient, so you don't have to wait too long.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly, and we loved that they would give us a sample while they were preparing our order.

The waitress said, \\"let me find out for you,\\" but she never did, so I had water. \\nService was way too fast also - it was obvious by the timing that nothing we ordered was prepped freshly, and it was also obvious by the temperature and taste. Brussels sprouts were under-cooked and slathered in mild cheddar cheese - swimming in water and oil. Gazpacho wasn't bad, but it basically tasted like watered down salsa, and the plantain chips it came with had been fried a very long time ago, if they were made onsite at all.\\nMy husband  had the fried chicken, which was dry - though the buttermilk dressing was good. We also had the corn, which came out lukewarm, and a bit dried out.\\nWe were served all the food too quickly, and didn't get silverware or plates until a couple of dishes were already on the table.The waitress rarely checked in, and when I told her she could clear the brussels sprouts dish she didn't bat an eye, even though it was obvious we hadn't eaten much of it and were not interested in continuing since they were so bad. \\nHonestly - we were shocked at how bad everything was from the service to food. We were out of there quickly though, since they rushed all the orders out and it didn't take long to not finish the sub-par plates.\\nI feel like a jerk being so blunt, but this place is in a great spot and reportedly has a great chef.

I used to study here all the time, but I had to stop going because I was paying for ridiculously overpriced coffees that I legitimately could not swallow (both espresso drinks and hot/cold brews). Without a real light or even medium roast in sight, it seems all their roasts are \\"beyond french\\" - aka roasted to oblivion, which in my humble opinion murders the quality of the coffee. Not only this, but, due in part to the heavy traffic and in part to an obvious worker carelessness, the area behind the counter is a HUGE mess - coffee grounds and milk everywhere - and the baristas pay little attention to the quality of the coffee. The most blatant sin I have had the misery of witnessing time and time again is their handling of steamed milk - instead of steaming each milk for each individual product, portion sizes and texture customized for each espresso variation as it should be, the barista shoddily whips up a huge batch of steamed milk and plops it into each cup - no care for the integrity of the milk, the quality of the pour, or the art of coffee whatsoever. It didn't always used to be this way - I went there almost every day for over two years straight. There were real trained baristas, and not as much mess - some baristas even did latte art. Somehow, all of that has been thrown out the window: the good baristas quit, and I now see them at other coffeeshops around town, and the quality of the place disappeared. sad. The joint has, at this point, become a high-demand tourist destination, and because of the location and the hype it seems that the workers decided they could get away without care or quality. For what it's worth, their pastries are also pretty despicably stale - and just FYI cheesecake done properly features no cracks. Plus, I can't tell if their smoothies even have real, whole fruit in them. Overall, I feel artisanship was sacrificed to meet demands, but Mozart's is still charging artisan prices.

And sure enough, this is the best Cuban restaurant in town. However, I will take the time now to explain why this breaks my heart. \\n\\nMy credentials: I was born in Miami from Cuban parents and spent the first 25 years of my life there. I don't expect any restaurant outside of Miami to taste as authentic, but I do base my judgment on that scale. \\n\\nThe ambience: The restaurant itself looks like something out of  that 1940s Donald Duck cartoon \\"The Three Caballeros\\". Bright colors, overly exaggerated tropical themes, it's like someone's acid trippy version of Cuba, or what they assume Americans believe Cuba must be like.\\n\\nThis is a tiny restaurant, it doesn't fit very many people inside bumping elbows with each other on tiny tables. If you come, do so before 5 pm when it starts to get crowded and a line forms to get in. \\n\\nMenu: This is by far my biggest gripe about this place. I'm looking at the menu right now and there are 13 items on it, that's it. There are sandwiches and a ton of dessert options, but when it comes to actual food you're pretty limited. \\n\\nI am well and truly surprised at some of the things NOT on the menu. There is no steak at Pambiche for lunch or dinner. None. It's a staple of the Cuban diet, how can you not have Bistec a la Palomilla, Bistec Empanizado, or Bistec a la Milanesa, and call yourself a Cuban restaurant? I have no idea why they don't serve steak for lunch or dinner, since they do serve it for breakfast.\\n\\nFood: Now we get to the actual food, which ranges from mediocre to not that bad. As mentioned by others, the oxtail is pretty good, the ropa vieja is decent, and they make black beans ok. Most of their meals however are maybe a 4 or 5 on the authenticity scale, and I cry when I think people consider this \\"good\\" Cuban food. \\n\\nA perfect example of this came one time at Pambiche, sitting at the counter eating some platanos maduros. A man came up to me, possibly the manager, and after some conversation it came up that I was Cuban. He looked a bit uneasy, as if he knew the food wasn't really up to snuff, and looked at my maduros, noticed they were overcooked and offered me a new plate for free. It was a nice gesture, but the second plate wasn't any better. They simply can't make a lot of the food taste like it's supposed to, for whatever reason. \\n\\nPortions: this place reminds me of the old joke, \\"The food here is terrible.\\" \\"I know, and in such small portions.\\" The food here isn't terrible, but is in really small portions. I've spent $30 here and left hungry. \\n\\nI've tried both lunch and dinner, and per usual the dinner provides a few more things but still well below average for a Cuban restaurant. I've found the best deal to be coming during Happy Hour and ordering several small plates, but even that racks up a $20 bill without eating all that much. \\n\\nPrice: No meal will costs under $15. It's pretty expensive considering what you get, and most \\"platos\\" don't come with many of the basic necessities to enjoy a meal. I usually have to make several side orders for things you would get with a meal at other Cuban restaurants. This will inflate your tab to $20-25, and with tip about $30 for one meal, not including drinks. Again, for what you get it doesn't feel like you ate $30 worth of food, not in quantity or quality. \\n\\nService: The service is not bad, and I have nothing bad to say about it. I've always been seated promptly, rarely have to wait long for food, and as I've mentioned I've been properly compensated for any past transgressions. My problems with this restaurant are not with the service, but with the price, quality, and quantity of the food."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Love the various flights they have to offer.

In fact I felt like a cheapskate for the undeserved 18% I left him.\\n\\nAs we walked down the block, we were talking about how expensive the lunch was given what we had ordered.

There were two people working the food line. It really shouldn't have taken as long as it did. I definitely think it is a job that two people can handle. The first person who took my order and started it off was complaining about having to say \\"Welcome to Moe's\\" when people came in saying he hated having to do that. He was complaining about being understaffed. He was complaining about the managers being upset because they got poor reviews. He was complaing about having to work there because he went to such-and-such university and he shouldn't be working there. Well, you ARE working there so please spare the customers your complaints. For most people, 30 minutes is the time they get to eat lunch. It shouldn't take that long to get in and out of a FAST food restraunt. The staff did not mesh well together. One employee was complaing to another because he touched him while trying to get something out of an cabinet. Who needs to hear this crap?! For me, service is important and you have to decide if the food quality outweighs the service quality. The food was ok. Not terrible.

This is a great upscale place to visit near seaport. They have a really cool selection of funky eclectic beers and the bar area has a sleek industrial feel to it. It's a great way to kill some time as the wait for getting a table is often long (on average 1hr wait). I've had their lobster roll twice and it's exactly how I imagine a classic roll to be like, a fav of mine. They have a small menu, but everything on it sounds decadent and delicious.

My best friend was visiting from out of town and I wanted to take her somewhere special. We used to live in NYC and aren't easily impressed by new, trendy restaurants because they are on every block in NY. As soon as we entered LAH, we were impressed and transported to a different place. You really feel like you are in an art gallery and the bar area is aesthetically spectacular. I really liked the paintings all around the dining room and the brochure that explained everything (although some of those paintings that were listed at thousands of dollars really look like a kindergarten art project) The resident art expert was this fabulous woman with great style whose name escapes me but she was very helpful with the paintings and gave you a tour if you wanted.\\n\\nNow on to the food. While it is nothing to write home about, it was quite tasty and beautifully presented. We started with the mushroom dumplings which were excellent and I had the bacon/cheese flatbread thing. I love flatbreads because there are so many cool combinations you can do but this one fell flat (pun obviously intended) It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Both of my dining companions had the burger and loved it. What was really memorable were the cocktails. We had quite a few drinks and they were all strong and delicious. My boyfriend particularly loved the Mezcal drink and the waitress even brought him different types of mezcal to try.\\n\\nOverall it was a great dining experience, the ambiance and cocktails definitely made the experience, and I would recommend it to anyone celebrating a special night as it is not cheap!"},{"name":"Dim Sum Heaven","address":"5203 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Simple and cozy place.

I know Craigie is part of Cambridge's holy Trinity of Oleana and Cuchi Cuchi. I've been traveling here for work for some weeks, and was quite excited to give this place a shot. We went after work around 8pm on a Wednesday night.\\n\\nAs soon as we walked in, we were politely greeted, and they accommodated us at the bar while we waited for a table to get up, as we didn't have a reservation. They had a pretty healthy crowd for a weeknight. The decor is incredible. The drinks were excellent and bartenders very skilled. I had a vesper and thoroughly enjoyed it. My boss also noted that their ginger beer was rather tasty.\\n\\nFrom the time we sat down, the service was underwhelming. Our server was alright, but a few things happened over the course of the evening that definitely impacted this rating. We had two vegetarians in our party, and they were out of cauliflower, which was the base to their main veg dish. We were not informed of this until after the order was placed. Therefore, the veg plates netted out to be slightly more than onions and potatoes.\\n\\nThe food itself was pretty good. They brought us some complimentary small bites. Mine was tomato and caprese. For my first course, I got the pasta and it was EXCEPTIONAL.The sauce was a divine mix of sweet and savory. Highly recommend and they can modify to make veg if needed. The garden salad my boss ordered received average ratings, as did the oysters the rest of our party ordered.\\n\\nFor mains, we considered the pork shoulder, but did not want to wait the minimum 45 minute requirement to order that plate. The point ended up being moot as the two swordfish dishes and the two veg plates took over 70 minutes to come out, which we found distractingly long. I will say that the complimentary bread they offer between courses is delicious and they're not stingy with it. And the swordfish got rave reviews. I think the pork shoulder is the move for mains.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, the bartender came over and asked how things were. We figured he was to modify the bill for the bad service. Rather, he had come to grab the check as they hadn't transfered our drinks over. The messaging was frustrating given the lackluster service.\\n\\nOverall, I'd put this place closer to 4 stars, but given the high price point (close to $300 for dinner with 4, 1 drink each, no dessert), I have to go 3 here. It had the potential of a 5 star place though, and one of the few restaurants that seemed good for almost any occasion (aside kids).

I've been ordering here since I moved to Brookline about a year and a half ago.\\n\\nAlthough it will never replace my favorite place ever, Josephs Pizza at the corner of Huntington Ave and S. Huntington Ave, this place is great.  I've done everything I can think of to their pizzas:  Extra cheese, extra sauce, extra both, onions, jalapenos, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, etc. etc...and of the course their classic plain.  Every time without fail its been good.  Was it always easy to pick up and eat?  Well not always, basically when I ask for extra cheese or extra sauce, or when I asked  for onions and they got a bit too happy on it.  Interestingly enough, the onions still didn't overpower the pizza.  One complaint I have is their sauce isn't exactly flavorful, but hey whatever throw a little garlic powder and its a quick fix.\\n\\nAnywayz, try it if you have not yet.  NOTHING in the Boston area will beat Josephs in my opinion, but this is a good alternative, and at least Pinos Pizza excepts credit cards (unlike Josephs)."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Solid sticky buns and coffee.

If you don't already know, this is a 4 or 6-course meal based entirely on the chef's, well, whims. And that's totally fine, as you'll try things that you wouldn't normally order. For instance, my boyfriend laughed at me upon learning that I had eaten olives and *liked* them, even though I vehemently claim to dislike and avoid eating olives. So, live and learn! Although there are vegetarian and omnivore versions of the chef's whim noted on the restaurant website, they graciously catered to my preference for pescetarian dishes. The monkfish/shrimp/lobster entree was AMAZING. The pumpernickel breadcrumbs accompanying my chocolate bomb dessert with beet coulis were also a highlight. \\n\\nThere's a bar adjacent to the kitchen, and I also highly recommend calling them and making a reservation to specifically sit there.

Highly entertained.\\n\\nSo why four stars instead of five? \\n\\nWell, while I was highly entertained sitting at the counter during the chef's whim, it did occur to me that the dishes came out just a *little* too far apart. If I was sitting at a regular table, I could see the timing dampening one's experience. But maybe that's just time to imbibe more. Also, the steak and eggs option has disappeared at brunch. This is humanity's loss, really. Bring this dish back, Tony!

No explanation of the cuisine or how to eat it (fortunately I am already familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, but someone who wasn't would have been mystified). And this was on a Tuesday evening when the place was completely empty save for one other couple. Eh, it's a small, casual place so I won't really hold the limited service against them -- as far as I could tell, only one staffmember was even there and apparently doing all the cooking, serving, and tidying.

Fairly small menu.  Dish prices are nice and low.  Service was fast if not overly courteous.  My two Shanghainese companions and I had three dishes over white rice and an appetizer.  I'll give the consensus ratings.  \\"Scallion pie\\" appetizer = very good, nice freshness and consistency, though a bit bland and needing salt in the mix.  Shredded beef & vegetable with pancake wrap = excellent, bold flavor but not over the top.  Shanghai duck = very good, soft, not too boney, big portion, mild brown sauce (though it has nothing to do with Shanghai).  A chef's specialty, pork with Chinese celery = fair, a very strong and slightly sharp flavor to the meat, which was also shredded, and agreeable enough in small quantity, maybe 6.5 on a scale of ten.

I was a freshman at the time and still pretty unfamiliar with Austin, so I decided to citysearch chinese food. (Citysearch sucks!) Wanfu popped up on citysearch with a moderately favorable rating, so I decided to give it a try. \\n\\nI'm a follower of the Gilmore School of Chinese Food Ordering, so I end up ordering multiple dishes from a menu (enough to feed a small African nation) - and just eat it for the next month. I ordered the friend rice, lo mein, sesame chicken, Kung Pao chicken, some beef dish, and hot&sour soup. I placed the order over the phone and was told that it would be ready for pick-up in about 15 minutes. \\n\\nI walk into pick up my food, and as soon as my flip flops hit the carpet, my feet sink into it - the carpets were just caked with grease...gross!\\nThere were a few people sitting in the dim lit dining area, and waiting for takeout is me and this other guy. I stand there for 10 minutes, waiting for the hostess/waitress to help me, but not a single employee comes to the front desk. RIght then, out of the corner of my eye, I see something skirt across the grease soaked carpet and hide. I get a little freaked out, and am staring at the place where the thing dissapeared - when it makes another entrance. It's this huge rat and it has a friend! They're just streaking across the carpet, right in front of me and the other guy who's waiting for his food!\\n\\nBut that wasn't even the worst part. Finally, when the waitress/hostess comes out to help us, the guy and I tell her about the rats that we've just seen inside of their restaurant, and she answers, \\"oh, we set traps for them a couple of weeks ago - here's your food.\\" She couldn't care less about the fact that we had just seen two (out of who knows how many) rats just traipsing in their FOOD SERVING establishment!\\n\\nReally gross and horrible customer service!\\nDON'T GO HERE!!"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"There's *nothing not to like about Mozart's. If I lived nearby I would never have to go to another Starbucks ever again (except one of the two in Pike Place Market). As it is, I wish they more locations. Somewhere in North Austin or Round Rock would be preferable, if you're reading this, owner of Mozarts. \\n\\nThe coffee is delicious, and you can get it any way you like it. They use a brand that a lot of other coffee shops use, but I think they must add a little extra, because it's always just a hair tastier than anywhere else I've had a chai latte in Austin. \\n\\nThe desserts- Oh Em Gee. Not sure what you want for dessert? Go to Mozart's. It won't help you make a choice, but they WILL have something you want. Correction: they will have at least 5 things you want. There are so many cakes, pies, cookies, muffins, brownies and various other desserts there (Creme brule! Truffles! Gelato! Things I can't pronounce! F**k yes!), I hardly know what to do with myself when I see the beautiful display case. I also had a bagel there once, which was also delicious, but I must have been delirious that day, because I still can't quite figure out how I ended up not getting something sweet. \\n\\nThe service is great here. The peeps behind the counter have never been anything but polite, friendly and helpful. They move the line right along so even when there are 10 people in front of you you're only standing in line for a few minutes. I've only been here once when there was live music, but it was great- a jazz singer and her small ensemble, which I really enjoyed. She was good enough to play at the Elephant Room.\\n\\nWhat more could you ask for, you ask? Well, you get all of the above, AND the whole shebang is on the water front. So you get excellent coffee, a delicious snack, great service, good music, and a nice view (and a cool breeze if you're lucky). They're also open til midnight during the week and 1am Friday & Saturday, so whether you need a place to study or a romantic coffee after a late dinner or movie, they're here for you. Top that all off with free wireless internet and plenty of indoor & outdoor seating, and, like I said, what's not to like?\\n\\nAnswer: *Parking. Like every other place down town, parking is, let's say, a bit of a chore. On a busy night the lot can easily fill up, and you're left to do what you can with street parking. In this area of town, that can definitely be frustrating. It's mostly a residential neighborhood, so there's not a ton of street that's good for parking anyway. Then if you need to cross, there's not a light close by, so it's you against traffic and luck of the draw whether the drivers will be friendly that night or not. Usually they are. \\n\\nSeriously, Jack, open a north Austin location! Please!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My friends took me here for my  birthday and it was a great time.  But...THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MENU IS SHELLFISH AND SEAFOOD.  I happen to be allergic to shellfish and lots of seafood....right...\\n\\nAs so many of the other reviewers explained, you have to go into the restaurant one at a time.  This is great when you're already sitting down, but a pain in the ass when you're outside.  The place is really tiny and I felt a little claustrophobic.  We  had a group of 8 and we were squished a bit around 2 smallish tables, which wasn't ideal.\\n\\nSo we all sit down and get our menus and the waiter (who was really cool, by the way) starts explaining the sauces.  Apart from the pesto, it was shellfish fiesta.  My friends decided it would be a smart idea to tell the waiter about my allergies.  He looks at me, asks if I'm the birthday girl, I say \\"yes,\\" so he asks me, \\"and you picked this place??\\"  to which I said, in a really small voice, \\"noooo?\\"  They were really great there though and I loved our waiter; he was hilarious and super friendly.\\n\\nMy friends did feel really bad about the seafood thing, but I had never been to the north end before, despite being a local girl, and they knew I really wanted to try it out.  None of the other yelp reviews mentioned the shellfish fiesta, so I decided to make it a major part of my review.\\n\\nAnyways, I ordered the chicken, broccoli, ziti in garlic sauce and it was AMAZING!  oh my god it was the most fresh, crispy broccoli, tender pasta, tasty chicken, and delicious sauce.  Everyone else I was with was equally impressed with their meals.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, they brought a chocolate cake out for me and the entire restaurant sang me \\"Happy Birthday.\\"  I couldn't stop grinning.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place.

This area of town doesn't promise much for hunger after 10pm, and I'd just missed out on most places. As I'm riding around, I discover this little joint in a building I've never noticed before. Apparently, this place used to be Antonio's. Who knew? Well, a lot of people did, but not me. \\n\\nWalking in, there's not much to see. It's very open, and the entryway was kind of odd and half stacked up with stuff. Just keep moving past it, and you'll find a friendly bar with cute and friendly bartendresses. \\n\\nThankfully, the kitchen was still open. The menu didn't have too much on it that looked terribly interesting to someone who has a limited diet. I don't eat burgers, the turkey sammich looked like I could make a more interesting version at home. \\n\\nWhat's this? Ahi Tuna Tacos? Yes please! I got an order of them to go, with a side of sweet potato fries. I sipped on a well-made manhattan while they created what I was sure would be a flavor explosion. I also got a side of chipotle mayo for fry dippin. \\n\\nArmed with deliciousness, I headed back to my friend's place, about 2 minutes away.\\n\\nNow, don't get me wrong. These were some fine tacos. However, the fish was overcooked, in my opinion. Tuna should never be cooked over medium rare, and I figured I didn't have to order it that way since it was \\"seared\\". However, this poisson was medium well f'sure. It tasted fine, but I'd have liked it better if it'd not been cooked so much. The slaw was decent. There was a promised sriracha-based sauce that I was hoping would add a kick, but it turned out to be sweet rather than spicy.\\n\\nThe FRIES!!! \\nMan, these could keep my coming back on their own. Not terribly crisp, but certainly not too limp either. And they looked homemade. Plus! they were tossed in some garlicky goodness that really set off the flavors just right. They were good without my chipotle mayo for dippin. \\nThe mayo itself was a little disappointing and fell into the usual trap of Not-Enough-Chipotle-In-My-Chipotle-Mayo-Syndrome. Chipotle is not just a food coloring, people. Gimme a bit more spice, please!\\n\\nI went back one other night with a work buddy and had a couple drinks while watching the Yankees/Rangers game.

Having said that, there are some consistency issues with it. Sometimes it's really big and delicious and other times the actual veggie burger is on the small side and dried up. But again, when it's on a good day - it's one of the best sandwiches I have had and worth the risk. \\n\\nThe Boulder latte is delicious any time of the day, and they always have a special pie and pastry worth trying that changes every day.\\n\\nThe service is so friendly and has a great mom and pop feeling to it. I highly recommend this \\"off the beaten path\\" eatery, as it's in a strip mall behind the 29th Street Mall.

Thanks to lots of innovation and an influx of grilling nerds, there will be a huge argument as to whom makes it best. Snobs will pooh-pooh the idea that Salt Lick is the best... oh, so-and-so does it better. \\n\\nI live in North Carolina, where we will fight and all comers for wood-grilled pork (aka BBQ). \\n\\nBut I'll be damned. Salt Lick had the best pork ribs I have ever had in my life. Gorgeous smoke ring. Just enough crust. \\n\\nAnd their potato salad is the best in Western Civilization. Their brisket is one of the better examples of brisket. Burnt ends are, well, awesome as always. Their slaw is inoffensively bland - but not overly mayo'd. Low point: the crowds. \\n\\nSo, screw those folks who say you should go to another place. This famous place is famous for a reason.

It's not upscale by any means - it's in a strip mall with terrible parking and it feels like a hole-in-the-wall; however, that doesn't mean it lacks in service or quality. \\n\\nThe food is home-made good. I could eat here everyday. It tastes authentic and is VERY fresh.\\n\\nMy two staples are:\\n- the spicy seafood soup (for 2), which contains mussels, scallops, crab claws, mushrooms and shrimp.\\n- the green curry with chicken, which has an assortment of veggies as well\\n\\nBoth of those are enough for me and a guest. You might want to order another side of rice ($1 surcharge) to balance it out.\\n\\nI've had the pad thai and it's very good as well, but the two above are my go-to's.\\n\\nThough parking is terrible, they've made a system to where you'll be notified if you're blocking someone in (it's okay, you can block other cars in, you'll just be asked to move your car when the other is trying to leave).

From the menu to the ordering, the benches in the kitchen, everything is just authentic Italian family and the pizza shows it.  I frequently see Antico on national lists of \\"Best Pizza in the United States\\" and in my opinion, it should be ranked higher than anything in Chicago or New York - sorry, I love Joe's, Roberta's, Gino's, Giordano, Lou Malnati's and Frank Pepe's but the pizza at Antico is beats all of them hands down.  In my opinion, you will not find a better one outside Italy.  And perhaps inside Italy too.\\n\\nMy advice - take some time with Google to understand the ingredients and try something that you might not normally try.

We only go for the yogurt (so far) but my gosh, it's fantastic. So creamy and not overly sweet. Interesting flavors, and as far as the combos I always got the Humphrey prior to falling in love with the Pecan Delight. Now I can't help myself, I must have a large one of those every time I go, really yummy. \\n\\nThe only drawback, and the thing that I worry about in terms of CC surviving in Austin's saturated yogurt-place market, is that their prices are too high compared to chain competitors like Red Mango that also do a fine creamy yogurt, and have the ubiquitous topping bar. CC's model is a bit old fashioned in this respect, charging by the topping for a pick-your-own creation, which is why I always order one of their famed creations instead.\\n\\nWe go here a couple of times a month currently, but that would amp up significantly if their prices were a little more in line with the market. But I also have to say that NO ONE else sells yogurt this good around here, or just about anywhere, for my money. Which is why we'll keep coming back.

The day we went we were excited to try the famous salt lick.  It was raining, as we drove in we noticed it was not paved and there were so many potholes I would advise you not to drive your sports car.   We exited our suv and walked through muddy parking lot.  Their open flame pit is unique, but that's it for atmosphere, unless you really enjoy picnic tables.  I will challenge anyone to use fork only on the brisket.   It has good smoke, but is tough.   Chappell hill sausage is superior, and the ribs are just average.   The beans taste like they came from a can.   The potato salad has a German influence and is very good, as is the turkey and these 2 items bumped the score from 1 star to 2 stars.

In particular, there was one steamed vegetable curry with coconut which looked healthy but upon eating had raw mustard seed and unooked lentils in it, which made it literally the worst curry dish I have ever eaten in my life.

That's where good meals are born. \\n\\nSo the item with the longest most enthusiastic menu description was a sichaun fish dish.  My wife went sichuan as well with a tofu dish. Both came and both were excellent.  Not just Chinese restaurant excellent, but well mad dishes with deep flavors and seasoned with large amounts of very good sichaun pepper.  The fish firm but not overcooked, and the choice of silken tofu in the other dish was refreshing.  \\n\\nOh, and both entrees were enough to feed 2-3 people independently.\\n\\nApparently excited by our menu choices both the chef and manager came by to make sure everything was to our liking.  We assured them that everything was great and \\"not too spicy\\".  The fish was indeed very spicy.  Just right for my taste.\\n\\nWe were also given a hand written coupon for a discount on our next visit.  Not that a discount is necessary.
