We were back in the area for dinner and a comedy show on Saturday, and the place was packed with a line out the door and down the block.  We were told during a tour earlier in the week that they have so many people working that the line goes quickly, but I was really happy we found ourselves in Cambridge earlier in the day on Saturday and went to that Mike's instead.  We also did not make our way into Modern to do a comparison taste test. Like so many other places in Boston, we just ran out of time to go visit, and therefore, I can't add my two cents to the Mike's v. Modern.  Modern may be good.  It may be incredible, but if so, then it only ties Mike's."},{"name":"Mongkolchai Thai Restaurant","address":"7107 NE Vancouver Mall Dr, Ste C","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Good Food Great service, have tried something new each time I have been there, looking forward to more"},{"name":"Parma Trattoria & Mozzarella Bar","address":"1132 W Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"We went here to have lunch after reading the reviews in Yelp.

So to park in front of the restaurant you pay $10 or if you prefer to park in the back where there was absolutely no parking you'd have to pay $5.\\nThe second thing was the menu, I felt like the food was overpriced. I turned to my friend  who had already eaten at Senor Frog's and asked if the food was good and she responded she had better. We decided to skip the food, got some drinks instead (watered down margaritas) tipped the waitress and left.\\n\\nOh one more thing, while we were drinking our margaritas, we noticed that the crowd was rather young. I asked the waitress if there was some kind of party/ special event going on (I really thought I was on the Disney channel for a minute) and she said yes that there is a party  going on for young tourists who flew in from Argentina ( she said they were between the ages of 11-18 years old!).\\n\\nI understand that Senor Frog's being on \\"tourist avenue\\" would be somewhat pricey but to be honest $15.00 nachos is a bit ridiculous. Oh and on Friday nights there is $10 cover charge too..just after paying to park."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We have come here a couple times for family birthdays.

I was shocked to hear they were no longer serving dinner because the food is fabulous and the view is unparalleled. You park in the parking garage & get your ticket validated so that's easy too. Fajitas (not on the menu but secretly available); local produce, meats, & cheeses; margaritas; avocado tacos; Pure Luck goat cheese salad; tortilla soup. Not sure if they still do the to-die-for tableside guacamole. It's never full, which IS odd. I think they just don't advertise at all! I wonder if they could get Rob Balan in to do a review, if he's still around. Anyway, the location is fabulous, and their being closed at night points to nothing more than an APPALLING FAILURE to market if you ask me. The food is wonderful; the location is perfect--best view of the lake and the bridge--the service is uncertain at times but charming--there is no reason at all; why this place shouldn't be packed EVERY NIGHT. Other hotels overcome the \\"hotel restaurant\\" reputation--why can't this place?  Very frustrating. Other Austinites--do you ever see or hear an ad for this place?\\n\\nThey still have Marker 10 (very dumb name) open at night on the back deck. Also a nice view--not as good as upstairs but nice. You're on top of the hike & bike trail. Obviously it's hot out there--this is Austin. The menu was fine but limited.  However, since they closed the upstairs place at night they've supposedly expanded the deck menu. It's not online yet.

It was so flavorful, exciting, and rich; I wanted about 3 more plates of it and have thought about it on a regular basis since having it! \\n\\nAlso, I should note that I have a couple annoying and weird food allergies, and the bartenders were super kind to go out of their way to check that our food was safe for me, and then the busers would always mention that it was free of my allergen when dropping it off - just a really nice little touch that made me feel extra taken care of."},{"name":"Millennium Harvest House Boulder","address":"1345 28th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"2","text":"I was visiting my daughter that is attending the University of Colorado. I looked at a couple different sites for hotels. Chose this hotel because of its proximity to campus. Skeptical at first because of its reputation as the \\"drinking party\\" place during the football season. Looking at the pictures on their website, and their pricing: why not? Right?????  WRONG!  Upon arriving, on a Wednesday night, it's not busy in the least. We check in and are given our \\"superior\\" room with a courtyard view. We walk down a nice stone corridor until we reached the much smaller corridor with green carpet. Green stained carpet in fact, that had an odor that wasn't much more pleasant. We enter our room, only to find stained sheets then a spider comes running from beneath the pillow. I immediately asked for a different room. She very politely suggested a room on the 4th floor. I asked if it was in the same tower, she paused, then kindly said... \\"Let me see if there's a room in the \\"main\\" building, it was recently renovated\\". With a sigh of relief, we gladly took the key and headed upstairs to the \\"newly renovated\\" rooms.  \\nEntering the room we flipped the light switch...we flipped it again and again-nothing. Argh!!!!! It doesn't turn anything on or off. We find the light switch in the bathroom, flip it on just so we can see far enough into the room so we can turn the light on above the bed. The room looks exactly like the first room except for new carpet., and it's smaller. Oh, and a new make-up mirror in the bathroom. Settling in, we notice that there is an UBS plug as part of the clock radio. Odd: it's not plugged in. It is plugged into a nice power bar: but the power bar isn't plugged into anything. ???? So we move the beds away from the walls: there is not an outlet on the back wall, or on either side of either of the beds. Pretty certain that is not consistent to the regulatory building codes. So: switches that do not turn anything on or off and no power outlets. \\nShould have stayed at the motel 6.

The Vodka Southside and Lambo's Whiskey Punch will keep you rollin'.  \\n\\nNext, appetizers.  Broiled Gulf Oysters: good.  Spicy Deviled Eggs: exactly what they sound like.  Crispy Wild Boar Ribs: awesome!  Just wish more came with the order.\\n\\nSoups and salad: no idea.  C'mon now.  \\n\\nDINNER!!!  I think I'd have to recommend the hot links and any pork dish.  Try the Black Angus Filet rare or medium rare.  I personally wouldn't order an entree of fish at a barbecue joint but I did try a friend's rainbow trout and it really was good.  Almost all of the sides are good but my favorites have been the brussels sprouts (very rich), mac and cheese (super full-bodied cheese, very rich), and the collard greens (rich flavor but you get the point).  It's all good.\\n\\nNot super into the desserts but I'm a coffee guy so high-five on the Stumptown.  Not local but very good.  Other tips: call ahead for reservations!!!  Don't be afraid of doing a large-group reservation but be sure to give them plenty of notice and know that you'll be required to dine family-style.  This is actually a good thing because you'll be able to try more and you'll be glad you did."},{"name":"Parma Trattoria & Mozzarella Bar","address":"1132 W Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"I do like this restaurant.

A sizable portion, the lamb bacon was thick yet still crisp and did not leave me longing for the pork version. The accompanying tomato jam was rich and sweet and the dish was aptly joined with pickled onions and a rich cheese spread. The cucumber salad was artfully plated but lacking boldness in the flavor. A little seasoning in the dressing, namely salt, would have brought the dish together more. Lastly, we enjoyed the Manti, or Istanbul meat ravioli. Topped with a light and flavorful sour cream dollop, the meat filling had a nice spice to it that was reminiscent of middle eastern-spiced meat dishes, such as stuffed cigars. Overall an excellent dish. The chocolate cremeux for dessert sounded a bit better than it tasted and did not have the most elegant plating. \\n\\nService was excellent throughout the meal.

Only complaint is the portion size which was 3 drummettes and 1 wing piece for $7.

I had the pik pow chicken combo which came with steamed white rice, 2 small dumplings and 1 thai crispy roll sliced in two for presentation purposes. The rice was basic and un eventful. The thai roll was indeed crispy but seemed to only have shredded carrots inside. The pik pow chicken was great, my favorite part being the variety of mushrooms in the dish. \\n\\nMy friend had the wonton soup which was not the traditional kind you would expect from say, your local Chinese place. She said it was delicious but the wontons were small and there were veggies of some sort-cabbage perhaps--filling the broth. \\n\\nOverall, food gets a 4 out of 5 BUT service was painfully slow.

It's in South Congress which gets pretty crowded, but they do have parking in the back which is nice. I really liked the decor and ambience of the place. We got seated in an area to the left which was kind of separated from the main dining area. It was super pretty with shelves of bottles of wine and stuff all lined up around the room. \\n\\nWhen we first looked at the menu, it was quite intimidating with all the Italian words. However, our waiter, Trey, was super helpful in explaining the menu to us! We got the mozzarella appetizer which he recommended and it was perfect. He told us that they make fresh mozzarella themselves which is pretty unique. It was warm and soft unlike other places which usually give it to you refrigerated. Also, they give you fresh bread on the side that they bake themselves which I liked a lot. \\n\\nFor the main entree, I got the Linguine con vongole and the person I was with got the Pappardelle bolognese. They were both superb! I was really impressed with my pasta. It came with a lot of clams, more than what I feel like most restaurants would give and the linguine was cooked perfectly. The pappardelle bolognese was also really good! It was a lot heavier than mine with all the thick pasta, but the sauce was very flavorful.  We were pretty full by the end, but managed to fit in a dessert, the chocolate hazelnut cake. It was good and actually kind of reminded me of a Ferrero Rocher because of the hazelnuts. \\n\\nPricing wise, it's definitely on the more expensive side, but I think it's worth it. I've also heard Enoteca, their other place which is right next to Vespaio (I believe it's more of a cafe than Vespaio) has about the same things on the menu, but less pricy.

Everything about the rolls was great, from presentation to quality... and they were very tasty too!\\n\\nYou can also find some very reasonably priced bottles of wine here as well.  We went with a $22 Riesling and it complimented the meal quite well.  \\n\\nWe were both very impressed with the d√©cor inside Seito.

The acidity of the pickled vegetables cuts through the barbecued pork and the crusty bread gives the sumptous mouth feel culminating in a perfect bite. Considering that this is a bakery, the bread quality is excellent, but if you don't believe me go and smell the bread yourself. \\nThe quality of their banh mi sandwiches makes for an excellent luncheon, and considering the price it is quite the deal. If you enjoy a good po boy, I highly recommend going to Lee's bakery and having a couple banh mi sandwiches.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is typically very crowded, very loud, and a large hustle and bustle between the bakery and the restaurant.

This restaurant had been on the must go to places for food for quite some time and I and my party decided to try it out. We had a party of 5 and we were given a wait time of 50 minutes and we were sat in 15 minutes, so we were pleasantly surprised. They have a great store with a number of chocolate goodies. The decor of this place is amazing, as well as the outside of the restaurant, it is all fabulous. \\n\\nOur party had ordered a few drinks, I had ordered the Too Chocolate Stout and it was incredible. The taste was amazing. Others in our party had ordered a cocktail and while did they enjoy it, it was very sweet and she could not drink all of it. We ordered two orders of the chocolate almond bread and it was fantastic, very sweet and warm. Most of the menu has some type of infusion of chocolate in it is worth it to try to incorporate it into every part of your meal.\\n\\nI ended up ordered a burger medium well and it was cooked to perfection. The brioche bun was lightly buttered and very delicious. The fries were your standard fare. The rest of our party had ordered pasta dishes and brunch (served all day) and they enjoyed their meals. However, the best part of the experience is always dessert. Their desserts are beyond unique and it is why people come to eat here. We ordered the Reese's sundae and a Brookie sundae to share with the table and another in our party ordered a Rice Krispies milk shake. The sundaes need to be shared by at least 2-3 people cause they are huge, but they are worth every penny. The only thing I would say is that the ice cream in the sundaes melt way too soon, but consider it a delicious sweet soup. \\n\\nThe service was top notch, she was fantastic. I so wish I could remember her name, but let's put it this way, she was wonderful and made our experience that much better. While I do not go to Universal often, whenever I do go back, I hope this establishment stays for a very long time, because I will be back.

My friend told me about this place and said that every month a new mom is selected to feature some of her tried-and-true options on the menu. I was intrigued by this idea and I love breakfast food so I made it a mission to go at least once. Since my friend has been there before he did note that there may be a wait, but usually it never lasted more than half an hour. So although we went during the prime hours we did have to wait, but not that long or at least it didn't feel that long (maybe because we were expecting the wait or because I was already in good company).\\n\\nPricing is slightly above the cheap scale for breakfast food so basically not the cheapest, but it makes up for the price in the quality of the food. Since I'm a typical girl I get full easily, but I want to say my friend was definitely on the satisfied side when he was done so he probably could have went for a dessert. \\n\\nFood was delicious!! Then again I usually just order what I know I'll like, but I do also like every breakfast food!  Their potatoes were amazingly done with the right spices. The ingredients tasted very fresh to me. Not the best place to go if you are calorie counting considering its good ol comfort breakfast food.\\n\\nThey do not however have their own parking garage, but we did mange to find a convenient parking on the street and we didn't have to pay since it was on a weekend (or at least I didn't think we paid, unless he did... not sure what the rules are about street parking in Portland)"},{"name":"Thai Orchid Restaurant","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Really enjoyed the sushi.

It was so nice to watch, and brought back so many happy memories. Incidentally,  there was a New Orleans transplant was waiting for food with her daughter,  just ahead of us. That should tell you something. Complimentary onion rings (I think the owner does that for first time patrons) were very good, cayenne in the batter served with a zesty sauce. Catfish po boy was perfect, Ma's shrimp po boy was said to be very good. I'd suggest getting here before noon, the line was out the door as we were leaving around 12:30.

Was told we were flipped to 'seated' on the app they use, where the reservation was tied to my name and phone number, so this seems more like gross mismanagement of their seating tool than a swiped reservation.

Pizza is a funny thing and I can be particular now when eating it because in the past when I wasn't particular Ive gotten sick. This place with all the things I've written in this post about it DID NOT MAKE ME SICK. Not one stomach cramp or digestive issue. The guy working that day was nice and friendly he also made a good pizza. After u order he reads the order back to you to make sure it is correct which is what people should always do when ordering food its just that little thing called accuracy.  They have the options i like in my pizza gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, and then of course regular pizza dishes for those who want a free for all.  I just ordered a simple vegan pizza that was the bomb. I like how the cheese was put on last it serves as a blanket over all the ingredients and helps the pizza stay warmer longer.

Barring that, go on an unpopular day, go when you are not starving, or go kind of later when it is slower. \\nOr, like I just learned, order to-go. That's right, they do their whole menu to-go.

The room is also understandably chatty - not the place to go for an intimate meal.\\n\\nI prefer the breakfast menu to the dinner menu.  Dinner is great, but not as exciting to me.

It's pretty fun and definitely not your ordinary brunch.\\n\\nThe good: I found the food to be very good. Good quality and a diverse selection. There was enough options to please everyone and we definitely got seconds of our favorites (I love all the buns and dumplings the most, no matter the filling). Can't really go wrong with anything deep fried right? I personally try to ask what things are before going ahead and getting something that turns out to be tripe (which grosses me out but my friend loves). \\n\\nThe bad: It's super super crowded on weekends. I've been there on Saturday and Sunday and it's always a wait. If you come with a small crowd you usually end up sharing a table if you want to be seated sooner rather then later. Don't come late either. I believe dim sum ends sometime between 1-2PM but coming at 12:30 is not good. By the time you get seated and settled there aren't as many food carts going around and your options are limited. It sucked actually because I didn't end up getting my favorite thing (dunno what the proper name is but they are lotus seed paste buns). So word to the wise, get out of bed and come early, you will have a better time. \\nThe language barrier can also be frustrating, especially if you don't know anything about dim sum. I've found that the servers upstairs knew more English and were more helpful but maybe that was just me. It helps to have a friend that knows more. \\n\\nIn all I say it's a good place for dim-sum.

The people are fast so you can get in and out in 30 mins on a busy weekend.\\n\\nThe FOOD: Come here for the cannolis. They serve other pastries as well. Many flavors to choose from.

Our waiter was some dude named Addison. He started out just fine. Great attitude, polite, and respectful. \\n\\nI had the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Eel Roll. My boyfriend had the Insanity Roll, New York Roll, and the Spicy Tuna Roll as well. They were all delicious. My boyfriend didn't like the insanity roll because it didn't have any \\"kick\\" to it at all. \\n\\nWe sat in the area where the bar was. I have to say it was very nice in there. Loved the couch they had and all the other decor. While we were enjoying our evening we noticed that our waiter was becoming more and more \\"M.I.A\\" if you know what I mean. We ate and once we were done we wanted a to-go box and the check. Our waiter was talking to some guys that he obviously knew and stood at their table for quite a while. My boyfriend was staring right at him. This went on for too long and I started to get upset. The more he ran his mouth the worse my temper got. \\n\\nLuckily, another guy named Dan (Superman theme plays) came along and asked me was everything okay and if he could help me. Politely, I told him that I would like a to-go box and the check please. He was so sweet. He went right ahead with everything and got us taken care of. I asked him what his name was, shook his hand and gave him a tip. I usually don't carry cash but I just happen to have some. I graciously thanked him and told him that they need more people here like him. \\n\\nAfter all of this went on don't you know dude was STILL TALKING to those people?! Im like what in the world?

I think our server had a large section inside so we were forgotten about a few times. \\nWe got the calamari for an appetizer which was ok. It had a lot of non-calamari pieces in it (banana peppers I believe) which for the price I got more peppers than calamari. \\nI had the roasted chicken with potatoes and Brussels sprout leaves?

But after 6pm it goes up $5 to $42.99pp)  The other people I was with ate between 6-7 lobsters apiece and other stuff as well... The cheapest I've purchased live lobsters is $5.99/lb.  The lobsters were approximately 1-1.25lbs each.  Assuming they were 1lb each, that would have cost me $36+ per person in lobsters to buy and steam.  But that's taking into account the lobsters alone!!!! They ate other things like oysters, mussels, and other seafood items.\\n\\nDessert was ok... I rarely eat any dessert at an AYCE restaurant unless there's creme brulee(!!!) which I love!  There was ice cream which was somewhat hidden...

Our server was friendly and attentive, although gave us the wrong price for a pitcher of margarita (she thought it was ~10, it was $19.99). We ordered fried pickles, a margarita pitcher, chicken sausage gumbo, hot buffalo, bbq char-grilled, buffalo blackened garlic parmesan and buffalo lemon pepper wings. Sorry to say, sadly disappointed in the flavors and texture. The bbq char-grilled wings were decent, more of a 3/5. The rest of the buffalo wings didn't have that deep fried texture or flavor as the menu stated, but appeared boiled...or like it was microwaved. To top it off the flavors were not great, the \\"hot\\" flavor was mild and tasted like old hot sauce. The gumbo was ok, although salty, I'd give it a 2/5. Fried pickles and margarita were the highlights. None of us were impressed or satisfied with our meal. We were also asked the typical ranch or blue cheese question and found out when we got our bill that we were charged 69 cents each sauce, would have been nice to know that was extra."},{"name":"Lima Criolla","address":"6406 N Interstate 35 Frontage Rd, Ste 1550","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I go to Peru every other year to visit family and the food here taste identical to the food in Peru!

Since this pairing is what the Yaletown Brewing Company specializes in, it has all the potential of being a great spot.  However, after going to Yaletown Brewing, I left with a feeling of disappointment as the food was fairly uninspired, while the beer was generic and forgettable.  This doesn't mean Yaletown Brewing isn't an ok spot to go to, it just means that it's not something I would suggest people go out of their way to get to.\\n\\nI see myself as a bit of a beer aficionado. When a friend of mine came in for a quick overnight visit and was staying in Yaletown, I thought it would be a great excuse to check out Yaletown Brewing.   In the heart of the Yaletown food district is Yaletown Brewing with a large patio, restaurant and bar.  Being a week night, we figured it wouldn't be hard to get a table.  However, when we first entered we were kindly greeted and we asked for a table in which we were told the restaurant was full but we could sit on the bar side.  Looking over the the restaurant side, there were a lot of tables open.  Doing a quick search on OpenTable using our phones, we could make a reservation for 2,3 4 or 6 people at 6:45pm, 7:00pm, 7:15pm and so on.   So we were a bit confused, but it didn't really bother us to go sit on the bar side, so we headed to there.  \\n\\nThe pub was fairly busy for a weeknight, with about 20-25 people spread throughout the pub side.  With this said, there was still plenty of room, as the space is huge. Within a minute of two we were given food menus and asked for drink orders, but being our first time we had no idea what they brewed and/or currently had on tap.  We were given the options and shortly our beer arrived.  Unfortunately, I was left disappointed after trying about half of their beer offerings.  To me the hefeweizen was very weak in flavour, the downtown brown tasted more of a pale ale with minimal nut flavour (keep it clean people), and the stout tasted more bitter than smooth and creamy. To boot, the price of the beers was not to be found on the menu, which we found out later were $6.50 a sleeve, not a pint, sleeve.  At a place that is making the beer ON SITE, I would anticipate a full 18-20oz pint, since the transport and bottling costs are significantly reduced with it being a brewery.\\n\\nOn the note of food, we ordered the Mumbai Curry wings to share and then each our own sandwich-like main dish.  The breading on the wings was nice and crisp, but the sauce on the wings were in spotty patches and, much like the beer, not very flavourful.  The wings were served with a dipping sauce, in which my dinner companions felt it was creamy, but also had no flavour (you're probably noticing an obvious theme by now).  When we got our meals, they were all ok (Prawn sandwich, schnitzel sandwich and chicken sandwich).  All-in-all the sandwiches were pretty tasty, but by getting us substituting in onion rings or a ceasar salad, the three meals came to $50. Take it as you will, but for just ok pub food, it thought it was a bit much.  On that note, the onion rings were large; however, in making this substitution you only get a few onion rings which, you guessed it, didn't have much flavour.\\n\\nOverall, the experience wasn't bad at Yaletown Brewing, but the lack in seasoning on the food and having beers which don't carry bold or distinct flavours (maybe to appeal to a larger audience), left me wanting a bit more.  To add to this, having 5 sleeves of beer, 2 beer tasters, an appetizer and 3 entrees giving a bill of over $125 with tip seems a little bit much in my opinion, especially with so many options in 5-10 min walking distance."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Located in Little Italy, Mike's Pastry is expected to always have a line out the door.

I got the Mixed Platter for two ($16.95, they accept CASH only!!) which comes with 1/2 tandoori chicken, chicken curry, basmati rice, mixed veggie curry, 1 samosa, 1 plain naan, and 1 pakora. TBH I was worried before getting to the joint that the menu I found online wasn't an updated one and that the prices would've gone up a bit as I sometimes find. Thankfully, this wasn't the case! The place is tiny and feels very much cramped with not much seating. There's a small open kitchen and maybe 3 tables plus some stools by the window and seating upstairs, but I didn't bother trekking up the steps since a table opened up soon enough. \\n\\nI also got a mango lassi ($2.50) which was quite tart on first sip, probably from Punjabi Dhaba's homemade yogurt recipe, but not in an unpleasant way. I liked how it didn't taste overly sweetened or the mango flavor wasn't drowned out and the drink was a very fresh vibrant yellow-orange from the mango. I was pleased to see one of the employees bring out a whole tray of freshly-made mango lassi's from the back and re-stock the beverage fridge. \\n\\nNow about the meal: WOW, was I excited to see our mixed array of items served on two large metal trays. Plenty of rice, chutney and yogurt sauce for dipping our tandoori chicken in. The chicken meat was tender and perfectly baked. The samosa was large and well-seasoned. The naan, though plain, was on the thicker side and hearty and had a nice soft chew. Veggies in the curry were soft and delicious. I am a huge fan of having diverse options on my plate and this meal provided all of the textures and flavors that make up a great meal.

There is absolutely nothing special about the cannolis at Mike's. A cannoli is a cannoli, every single italian restaurant offers them.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. \\n\\nWe had additional guests that tagged along with our party than we expected. They gave us grief about the additional guests.

However, later that evening I come to find out they had a entire PARTY room available BY the end of the night we were the ONLY party in this room!!!  Which I don't understand! Why give us the run around when you have the availability to seat us??? Yes we were wrong in not having the correct amount of people accounted for. But don't give grief when you have the room and that equals more business and revenue for that night. \\n\\nOnto the rest of the night: The ambiance was amazing. We had window seats to the view of the river. Very serene. It was relaxing the lights were dim and the band was playing smooth jazz. I ordered the scallop and crab risotto entr√©e. The scallops were huge and tender. The size of a silver dollar. The risotto was lukewarm by the time the food arrive I did not want to argue about the temperature; I was starving! The others in my party ordered--The Lobster special,  steak, seafood platter.  OH and the wait to receive our food was like a good 1hr and half. I had a new adult beverage they were making at the new sister Mexican restaurant a few doors down the street. Basically it was a rip off of a Spanish coquito--LOL! It was decent. The alcohol was ever present in this drink I felt this by the 3rd one. The drinks were reasonably priced at $10. That's average for a place like this. \\n\\nALL in all  the dinner was so-so.

It was a perfectly acceptable truck and I do plan on coming back to try some of their other stuff if I find myself in Beaverton again. \\n\\nI recently discovered the wonderful world of cemitas when I was down in LA visiting family over the winter holiday season. If you find yourself in the Valley down there, do yourself a favor and go to Cemitas Poblanas Don Adrian. I had my first and only other cemitas there by accident and it really rocked my world. I knew I had to have another, so the first thing I did when I got back was find a local cemitaria. I used the excuse of visiting friends in Hillsboro to stop by this place. Luckily it is located right off the Beavteron Max station in the parking lot of the 76, so it is pretty easy to get to. \\n\\nThe cemitas on the menu are the most expensive thing by far. The tacos are $1.25 and the burritos are $5 which would make this truck very reasonably priced. However between a cemitas and a coke, it came to $10 which seems a little high for a meal at a taco truck. I immediately realized why when I got the sandwich. This thing is HUGE. I was really hungry and I just barely managed to finish it and I didn't have to eat again until pretty late that night when I had a small snack. I ordered the carnitas and my girlfriend got the M.D Res (breaded steak). \\n\\nThe first thing that differentiated this cemitas from the last one was the bread. The bread really made the sandwich at the last place. It was egg washed and baked to a perfect crispness. A hybread between a brioche bun and a baguette. This bread left something to be desired. It felt and tasted like something that came from Restaurant Depot. My other complaint is with the meats. My carnitas were quite bountiful, but they were a bit soft and very fatty. There were a couple hunks that were just pure fat, no meat at all. My girlfriend's beef was a little on the dry side, but I experienced that before so it might just be the way it is. \\n\\nThey also had a couple things on the menu that I had never heard of before, tlacoyos and picaditas. They looked pretty good from their pictures so I'd like to try them out. If you find yourself in the area and need some typical and even atypical Mexican fare, you can't go wrong with this place.

The menu is largely fancy versions of BBQ -- each meat has its own style/sauce rather than one fits all.  There are several $8 sandwiches available and a plate lunch for $9.  Branch out to two meats, however, and prices rise quickly ($12 for 2 and $15 for 3).  Everyone at lunch was quite happy with the tastiness of the mains, less pleased with the sides.  The waffle fries were lauded, everything else was dismissed -- too small, too not very good.\\n\\nDinner prices are out of my range for BBQ, no matter how fancy the cue.

I can be forgiving of a few dollars but really?  I told the hostess that I did not want it anymore because that is not what it was priced online and that was way too much to pay for a roll.  She then argued with me that they already made it.

She then went over and told the person making the sushi and a table of men (apparently the owner). They were all making side comments to eachother, shaking their heads and laughing to themselves.

I have been waiting for crawfish and Southern food since vacationing in Louisiana years ago. Now to the experience...\\n\\nWe went at 6PM and enjoyed the $2 drafts on selected light beer as well as the fact that apps are half off and Oysters are only $1 (during happy hour). We were one of 6 tables at that time. We started with 6 oysters and you could tell they were pre-shucked and most likely sitting on the plate in a fridge for a while. There was very little juice and they were dry. Ok, not a deal breaker. We waited quite a while for our waitress to bring them over as well as get our drinks/take our order. \\n\\nI got the crawfish boil and my wife got shrimp etouffee. The shrimp was extremely overcooked! I'm talking we both looked at each other and said \\"have you ever had shrimp that bad.\\" It was like eating rocks. My crawfish was ok but you could taste that it was previously frozen. It was edible and the seasoning was about the only thing that they had right. \\nAfter my hands being covered in crawfish guts and seasoning I wanted to rinse them off and wash them so I asked where the bathroom was. It is inside the hotel next door. I found the bathroom and rinsed my hands off only to find there was no soap in any dispenser within the hotel (nice hotel huh?). I went to the front desk to ask for some but of course there wasn't anyone there!\\n\\nI'll leave the terrible dessert experience out of this and just skip to the check. I noticed that if it was your birthday you get a $25 credit (the equivalent to a meal). So I asked about it and the waitress stated it was true and that it had to be the day of your birthday. It happened to be so I provided her with my license. She then went to get the bill. After 10 minutes she came back and stated the manager (possibly the owner) was adjusting the check. 5 minutes later the manager came over and asked me for my license to verify it was in fact my birthday! Do you not trust your staff? I showed him and he then took another 5 min to provide the check. \\n\\nAs we were there we heard every table complain whether it be that their food was bad or that their table was never cleared from their apps to their dinner. The one positive thing I do want to credit and mention is the waitress. She was extremely pleasant and thoughtful. \\n\\nBottom line - The happy hour and menu sound great to get you in the door, but once you taste the food you'll soon realize there isn't one person in that restaurant that knows how to cook Southern food!

When I asked for the \\"other\\" menu, my server was perplexed and explained that there aren't different menus. Yes, dear, there are. She then explained that I needed to sit in the dining room in order to utilize that menu. I was literally 6' from the dining room, so I asked if I had to be moved to be able to order off the other menu.

On most weekend mornings and afternoons, the crowd outside Zaftigs resembles something that can be compared to Grand Central Station during afternoon rush hour on a Friday.  This is certainly an obstruction for those living in the neighborhood who are trying to make their way to the T or walk their dog, and also causes a serious congestion problem for patrons of other Coolidge Corner shops and restaurants.  I believe this problem can be remedied if Zaftigs owners and hosts would simply remind their customers that standing in and blocking public access ways contributes to congestion in an already busy part of town and can also be dangerous in some situations.  This would help to paint Zaftigs in a more positive light with their neighbors and also help them become team players in making Coolidge Corner a nice place to live and shop. \\n\\nThe food at Zaftigs is the traditional diner faire.  However, at most diners the patrons usually do not pay $12.50 for a corned beef sandwich. Their ability to charge abnormally high prices may be the result of a supply and demand issue.  Zaftigs really is the only restaurant of its type in this part of Brookline.  Therefore, they have a monopoly on the diner niche and can charge a premium.

We didn't have a reservation and only had to wait about 10 minutes at the bar during peak dining time. Upon first impressions, this place has it goin' on. The atmosphere is very open and clean, yet eclectic and personable.\\n\\nIt had everything in it that I'd put into a restaurant's decor. A nice open kitchen, nice floors, a dark, classy bar, perfect lighting, really, everything.\\n\\nI came to learn during my weekend trip that it's not so much a venue-specific thing, but rather and Austin-specific thing to have really good beer on tap. And Lambert's definitely does not disappoint. They have a good variety of draft beer available, many of which are local for starters. \\n\\nNow the menu is where I lose consciousness. The food is so mind-numbingly delicious, that it's hard to recall exactly how the evening went (and no, it wasn't because of the beer.)\\n\\nThe main reason that I wanted to go here in the first place was that I saw they had a smoked fish option on the menu. Being a pescetarian, barbecue is often off-limits for me, much to my dismay. So seeing something that I was able to eat made for a very, very happy Chris.\\n\\nBefore we ordered our main courses, we opted for the chickpea appetizer and hot damn! it was great. We went for a healthier choice, since we knew we had a long night ahead, and it fit our hopes perfectly. It was perfectly roasted and served with goat cheese and then grilled flat bread for dipping.\\n\\nFor the main course, as expected, I went with the cold-smoked trout. And wow, was it incredible. It was served with some sort of cheese and green beans on top, and really was too much food for one sitting. But hey, I was on vacation, I'm allowed, right?\\n\\nIn addition, we ordered 2 of the family style sides to share. We went with the lemon grilled spinach and the potato salad, both of which were out of this world. The sides really were huge, and we likely would have been fine with just one, but we wanted to sample a few different things.\\n\\nWe didn't go with dessert as we were stuffed to the brim as it was, but they had some really good sounding options.\\n\\nI will say, the later half of our meal was shadowed a bit by a bad server. He plainly ignored us for a lot of the time, didn't refill drinks, etc. It wasn't a great experience, so we decided to just mention it to the manager at the front. I wasn't expecting anything other than them hopefully fixing the situation, but the manager went above and beyond to right the situation. Not only am I sure that she was going to talk to the server, but she also gave us a gift card as an apology for the bad service. \\n\\nNow, since we only had another 2 days in town, we knew we had to plan a trip back, regardless of our semi-full schedule. That being said, right before heading to the airport, we stumbled in for lunch and had yet another amazing time. I wasn't super hungry so just went with the fried green tomato salad and a side of the mac and cheese.\\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were one of the most creative presentations of the dish I've ever had. It had two beautifully fried tomato slices, with a lump crab cake salad in between-- and it was big, chunks of crab, not the stringy cheap stuff. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese was also absolutely mind-blowing. The richness of the cheeses was only enhanced when I tried out some of their house hot sauces on top, making it even more incredible.\\n\\nBefore leaving, we picked up a bottle of their barbecue rub so that we can have our own little piece of Lambert's in Washington, DC. \\n\\nI made a lot of new favorite places in Austin, but Lambert's by far is at the top of that list."},{"name":"Tennessee Red's BBQ","address":"2133 SE 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I went here to watch the superbowl and i was pretty disappointed in the food since i'd read favorable reviews on here.

The other two got La Cellier's \\"specialty\\", a ribeye with a coffee rub. First I have to say it was over salted for my taste, this may not be everyone's opinion.

They get your credit card information if you make a reservation and if you want to cancel make sure you do it no less than 48 hours prior to your reservation otherwise they will charge you $50. Our reservation was for 4:45pm and the place started getting more packed shortly after that. We weren't seated right at 4:45, we were seated at 5:10pm. We asked to sit outside and they were nice enough to find us seating outside which we had to wait an additional 5 minutes for. There are fans outside and umbrellas. \\n\\n- They have complimentary valet parking and you can also park your car outside of the valet area as long as there are spots available. \\n- Their dinner menu starts around 3pm.

This place is on our list of \\"must-haves\\" before we leave.  \\n\\nNow, if you hate seafood, don't bother.  But if you're like me and my husband and can eat your weight in shellfish...BRING YOUR APPETITE :).  Yes, it's $35 per person (cheaper if you come before 4 PM) but if you can eat the hell out of some lobster & crab, you'll have gotten your money's worth by the time the night is out.  \\n\\nThere used to be a cook there who recognized my husband on sight- even though we only go there twice a year.  It's because my husband can usually eat somewhere in the range of 14 to 17 lobster tails.  This cook would see my husband up there and after his 6th or 7th lobster, the cook would go dig up the BIGGEST lobster in the bunch and steam it up special for my husband.  It usually earned the man a $20 tip, which also probably accounts for him remembering my husband!   \\n\\nI usually polish off several pounds of crab legs; they're fresh and cooked just right.  They have other types of non-descript seafood; crappy sushi, cold crawfish, some sort of breaded/fried whitefish, some kind of shrimp pasta, etc.  They also have London broil; I haven't ever noticed Prime Rib (if I didn't notice it, it probably wasn't worth eating as Prime Rib is my second-favorite food besides crab legs).   Some of this stuff might be worth a nibble, but the main reason to come to this place is the lobster and crab.  \\n\\nMy only complaint is the ambience; I know it's a family-friendly place but between parents and management, you'd think something could be done about the hordes of unruly kids that are often seen running around the place and groping unattended at the buffet.  Last time we went there, a trio of 5-8 year old boys proceeded to use a stack of high chairs and some of the wall decorations as a personal gymnasium.  No more than 2 feet behind our table, and neither the parents nor the management did a thing about it.  If you're going to bring your kids here, please make sure they're well behaved.  Or, keep them on a leash."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Awesome cannolis!

We were greeted by a host and given a table without any questions asked. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary dining experience.\\n\\nWe ordered drinks soon after we sat down, but it was not until after the drinks were delivered that our waiter began questioning our relation to someone that I presume was the restaurant owner, which we thought was odd. We laughed it off out of pure confusion. He then informed us that we had inadvertently stumbled into a \\"friends and family only\\" pre-opening event. We were embarrassed, uncomfortable, and unsure as to how we should proceed. Within a few minutes, someone else (perhaps the owner, or a manager?) came over to our table and accused us of trying to crash the party in order to get a free meal. \\"Didn't you see the sign outside?\\" he rudely berated us. Neither of us had noticed the 8 1/2 x 11 piece of white paper taped to the window. We apologized, but he did not seem to believe that we had no intention of intruding on his party. He begrudgingly said \\"You can finish your cocktails because I don't want to be 'THAT GUY' that takes them away, but after that I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\\"\\n\\nThe entire exchange was humiliating and uncomfortable. Why had no one questioned us when we entered, or asked us to present an invitation to the event? Why wasn't the sign outside bigger, bolder, brighter, and more clear that the public was not allowed inside? Why couldn't they have simply charged us for the meal, which we were planning to pay for in the first place?\\n\\nWhatever the case, I was extremely put off by the entire exchange and I will certainly never return to this restaurant. I will also advise others not to eat here. I am still insulted by the way that my friend and I were treated last night. It was rude and unprofessional.

We sat outside by a little dirt area with a small stage.  Wish their was live music there.  Service was ok.  No wow factor.  Waiter seem to just complained how hot it was the whole time.  The seats needed to be wiped down the floor was dirty.   Carpets were stained.  It was disgusting. Bathrooms were just in major need of a cleaning.  Garbage was over flowing floors needed to be swept.  I can see the inside of the kitchen while walking into our eating area and the floor was filthy.   I mean come on people if the health department walk through you so would be closed down then and there.  It was hazardous not just for their guest. But employees as well.   \\n\\nWe only ordered dessert because my friends mom said don't waste you money on the food.  We took her advice to par and didn't order a meal.  Prices were about average. We ordered the cheesecake, chocolate torte and the ice cream.  It was not bad.  How can you mess up pre made desserts?   It was not bad.  Taste as good as costco cheese cake.  I had a plastic cup of ice water which the waiter brought out 20 for like 11 people.  He told use to stay hydrated because it was hot outside.  Well at 7pm. It's not so hot anymore.   Thank for your thoughtfulness.   They had fans, mist fan and more to cook down the deck area.  Along with like 150 umbrellas.   Which the waiter took down 15 min before the sunset.  The umbrellas thrown in the back like they were a bouncy ball that would land softly.   That really showed me no pride in company property.  \\n\\nOne thing I didn't like was the sun glared so strong on the lake water.  You can get a sun tan on your face. Lol.  I kept my back facing the lake.  This lake water is very low.  I think it's more like 25% filled. I felt bad as I looked at the banks of the lake more than 50 ft away from the water.

To say that we were looking forward to BACON would be an understatement.  Both our Supreme Club sandwiches did not get the BACON on them.  I don't think it is legal in Oregon to deny someone their BACON. If it is legal, the law needs to be changed. Here, it happened on both our sandwiches.  While the sandwiches were tasty, we can only imagine how amazing they would have been with BACON. This was our first time here.

Getting up to Powell is a hassle, so the move was really convenient. The new spot is right off 161 near the 270 interchange, and the new spot is fairly spacious and a bit odd with a kids play area right in the middle. Also, they aren't open for lunch during the week which strikes me as odd considering how many companies are in the area. I feel like they're losing out on a lot of business.\\n\\nWe started off with the pork belly and scallion appetizer as well as some dumplings. The pork belly was good, not amazing. It's the same cut of meat used in the ramen bowls, so it's honestly not worth spending extra on. The dumplings were really tasty and looked like they were just made on the spot. There's not really a sauce that comes with it. Instead they just give you soy sauce and white vinegar to mix up yourself in a small bowl.\\n\\nAs for the ramen, I really loved the black tonkotsu ramen that I ordered, and so did my girlfriend. She ended up eating most of it. The broth had loads of flavor, and the meat was nice and tender. I ended up eating her soy ramen which she didn't really like. I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan either. It wasn't bad, but it really just lacked much flavor at all. If you're looking to try ramen, I'd stay away from this one, because you might be a tad disappointed.\\n\\nBesides having an uncomfortably awkward waiter, I'd say the rest of the meal was great. The menu here is pretty focused with only a few types of ramen to choose from and not a whole lot of other filler. Ramen focused restaurants in Columbus are few and far between, so this would definitely be a good place to start."},{"name":"Out of the Blue","address":"215 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Excellent overall experience.

All the flavors complimented the others perfectly. \\nWhat is really sweet about Mother's is their M.O.M.

I appreciate their commitment to source their chicken locally and to get it from the farm to the restaurant as soon as possible, to avoid having to freeze it, so I was OK with the fact that we could only choose from white or dark meat.\\n\\nI ordered white meat with the mildest of heat (I'm a wimp), with the mac and cheese and coleslaw. \\n\\nThe piece of chicken I received was so meaty, and I liked how some of the spice seeped down into the meat. And that skin and hot chicken seasoning -- drool. It brought the heat -- even on the \\"mild\\" setting -- without burning out my mouth. It was hot and full of spice, definitely not one note. \\n\\nThat mac and cheese was so rich and comforting. Happiness would be swimming in a vat of that. And the cole slaw was sweet, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nSome other things I enjoyed about Hot Chicken Takeover:\\n* The ranch dressing is a house-made staple and balances out the heat.\\n* That sweet tea reminds me of summer.\\n* I love the fact that Hot Chicken Takeover is committed to employing and training folks who have trouble finding employment otherwise. \\n* And either before or after enjoying some hot chicken, you can peruse the adjoining, sprawling food market. \\n* Hot Chicken Takeover displays its recent Yelp reviews on its website and outside the restaurant on the wall.

The hummus platter, the deviled eggs and the sweet potato poutine were all way better and bigger than i expected at happy hour prices as well! \\n\\nThere are also several delicious cocktails and drink specials on the HH menu, the chocolate martini was my favorite. They are fairly well known for their flavored martinis and making house infused vodkas, and the chocolate martini uses a vodka house-infused with dark chocolate (and is also the only cocktail on the HH menu featuring a house-infused spirit). The rim was dipped in Dutch cocoa, slightly bitter, which gave a really perfect contrast to the sweet martini.\\n\\nI plan on coming back, often, especially for Tuesday Happy Hours.

Perhaps he is wears only a loin cloth and has smeared war paint on his face as he wrestles the meat into a tender finale of juicy goodness.  \\n\\nOn a recent visit to this smoke scented scene, I chowed down on a fantastic Lambert's Frito Pie. Chunks of moist and tender beef topped with fresh pico, Lambert's queso and goat cheese cover a layer of Fritos. The cocktail I ordered, a Fernet Bellini, that consisted of Prosecco, peach nectar and Fernet, did not pair well with the cue at all.  It was too sweet and tasted a little like drinking perfume.  \\n\\nHappy Hour is the way to go here.  All appetizers are half price with $2 off beer, wine and cocktails.

This is my second time to try Lamberts I feel you should try a place at least a couple of times before yelping it.   Unless it sucks of course, then you can just yelp it right away. Lamberts did not suck. It was in fact really, really good. \\n\\nThe first time we went we did an appetizers for dinner evening.  We tried the Cornmeal Fried Rock Shrimp, the Green Chili Queso, the Frito Pie, and The Fried Green Tomatoes.  Then the kitchen sent out the Achiote Seared Chick Peas and Goat Cheese for us to try.   The kitchen sent out the additional appetizer, because I'm kind of a big deal.   \\n\\nActually, they sent it out because I had met one of the chefs the night before at Barfly's and he invited me to come down to the restaurant.  Great guy, he knows everyone in town and everyone knows him, I like guys like that.  Anyways, Lulu positively adored the Fried Green Tomatoes, and I really liked the Chick Peas. The Frito Pie is a meal in itself, I just like that it is on the menu.  The shrimp and the queso were very good as well.  \\n\\nI also had an Old Fashioned, they mix a mean cocktail at the bar. I'm serious, be careful. I have a pretty damn high tolerance, and one old fashioned had me pretty loopy.  \\n\\nAnyway, this time some of my friends who work at Little Woodrow's on Sixth had given Lulu and I a gift certificate to Lamberts for Valentines' Day.  What? Your bartenders and waitresses don't buy you Valentines' Day gifts?  Are you sure you are tipping properly? \\n\\nActually, I think it was a trick to get me out of the bar so they could have some peace and quiet.  Fooled them though, since we went to Little Woodrow's after Lamberts anyway.  Thank you ladies!  Now we are in a \\"nice\\" war though, just wait until I win the lottery. \\n\\nOne of the things my wife and I have in common is that we both enjoy sitting at bars.  At a restaurant, even a nice one, at Denny's at The Waffle House, diners, at other bars, we just enjoy bellying up to the bar.  We have found it is quicker (I have a patience deficiency), you get better service, and you get to know the place and its people alot quicker.  \\n\\nThis works well at Lamberts, at least early in the evening, because they have a big bar right where you walk in, plus they have a bar menu, and you can order from the dinner menu as well.   \\n\\nThis time, I ordered a Sanchez cocktail.  Titos, Olive Juice, a pickled jalapeno, a caper-berry and crushed ice.  Basically it was a dirty martini in a highball glass. I drank about half of it, and realized I was freaking loaded. Lulu had a Chapala, which was a big fancy strong margarita with orange juice.  She pretty much saved hers until after the meal, then she was loaded too.  The cocktails are pretty pricey.  Eight bucks and up, but they are mixed James Bond strength, and you really only need one. \\n\\nLulu had to have the Fried Green Tomatoes again, she said they were wonderful again. She loves the crab topping on them. I for one don't know why you would want to ruin a perfectly good fried green tomato, with a crab topping, but Lulu loves it.  I ordered the iceberg wedge, which was nutritious, delicious and quite delightful.  For dinner I had the cheeseburger.  It was smoked perfectly, the meat really tasted good.  Try Lambert's mustard and hot sauce on it. Really packs a zing.  It came with Herbed Waffle Fries, they were good with the mustard too.  Normally, I'd scoff at a $10 cheeseburger, but I'd pay $10 for it again.  Lulu ordered the Hanger Steak off the bar menu.  It is a hanger steak, which I guess is like a skirt steak, with a fried egg in the hole and some cholula butter.  I don't know what Cholula butter is, but apparently it is spicy goodness. Lulu said the steak was amazing, and even better the next day as leftovers. \\n\\nI hesitate to like anything in this new downtown district. Namely because I'm still very bitter over Liberty Lunch having to close.  But I have to admit, I like Lambert's.  I love that it is the only old building left around that part of town. I like the ambiance, I like that they get their hostesses from the secret land of incredibly beautiful hostesses (Denton?) I like that they know how to mix a drink.  I still haven't tried the barbecue really, I guess I will have to go back."},{"name":"Hero Sushi & Sake Bar","address":"4835 Meadows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Best sushi I have had in my life!

Luckily it was just the 3 of us and not our usual group of 6+. Kilala really is quite a small place with their largest table probably only able to seat about 6 people at the most, along with 2 smaller tables that seated 2 and 4 people in addition to the bar.\\n\\nWe arrived about quarter to 6 on a Saturday night and the tables were all taken so we got front row seats at the bar which has chairs for another 4 or 5 people.\\n\\nAs mentioned by others, you first place your order at the cashier and they'll bring it to you. Prices are very reasonable for what you get, the service is quick and we didn't have to wait very long for our orders.\\n\\nThe sushi was very good which explains why the Japanese consulate orders from them. I've been to a few Japanese run places and this one has been added to my list as one of my top favorites.\\n\\nMy only complaints about Kilala is that the size of the place may make it hard to get a seat so takeout is probably the way to go, and finally, being a little nitpicky here, I found that the rolls were a little loose and came apart easily if you weren't too careful about it. But having said all that, the quality of the sushi outweighs all of that and I will definitely be back for more whether it be takeout or dine-in.\\n\\nI should add, there is free parking around the back, but we weren't aware of this until after we got inside, and I'm not entirely sure if there is a rear entrance or if you just have to walk around the block to come in the front."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"While everything else was good, the ribeye was the star of the show.

Alas, I am just visiting Boston for a conference and I don't think the ambiance nor the drinks would necessarily draw me back to Davis Sq for another visit, but I would recommend this place to someone visiting the area.

I think the best way to sum up the experience is that it was confusing.  We ordered the burger (\\"normal\\" sized), the fried chicken sandwich (slider sized), the heirloom tomatoes (large-ish), the corn (small but very rich), the matzo ramen (weirdly huge - enough for three people!) and the Parker House rolls (2 rolls).  Of all of that, my personal favorite was the rolls.  They were light, airy, salty, doughy...I could have eaten them all day.  I did find that the sausage hidden inside was somewhat flavorless though and like an afterthought.  Just the rolls would have been fine, so as it was at 9$ or something like that they were pricey for what they were.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\nMost of the items I listed above had a fishy taste. Even the tomatoes.  As though there was fish flakes or some sort of really odd umami fishola flavo dust.  My partner agreed so I wasn't having an off-palate night.   Yuck.  If I want fish I'll order fish.  There was a great flow to the timing of the food coming out, but then a giant 15-20 minute stall at the ramen.  When it finally arrived, I was totally underwhelmed.  There was no \\"schmaltzy\\" flavor at all to the matzo balls.  Bland broth.  I'm not sure what sort of fusion attempt was made with this soup but it missed the mark. \\n\\nBoth the burger and the chicken sandwich were served on very soft \\"Wonder bread\\" style buns.  You can get a lot of really good burgers in the Boston area, so I think generally expectations are pretty high.  To serve a burger on a mushy plain old white bread bun....   meh.\\n\\nThe ambiance...confusing.  Open space was nice, lighting was ok, but it was SO loud in there on a Wednesday night.  \\n\\nThe good:\\n\\nSeated promptly though we were ten minutes early for a 7:30 res.  Excellent waiter.  When he noticed my untouched bowl of ramen, he asked me what I thought of the soup.  I told him that I didn't like it, and he took it off of our bill.  First, I would never have complained because the soup just wasn't to MY taste.  Second, for him to notice, ask, and then remove it from the bill was more than gracious.  That did indeed change how I felt about Little Donkey. So although we won't be back, it didn't leave a completely terrible impression.

I made two trips to the buffet and walked away very full.  The naan is served to you at your table, and it was by far the best naan I had ever had.  A few of my colleagues echoed that sentiment.  Fluffy, hot, and tasty, it must have been just baked (naan is baked, right?).  \\n\\nWe were all very pleased, and some of us even thought it was better than Rang's lunch (although they don't do a buffet).

Excellent bar area (up and down) with really neat and creative drink specials. They advertise as a BBQ joint, but it really isn't. Yes, they do have good BBQ, albeit more creative than your typical order at the counter BBQ joint. The menu goes far beyond just BBQ though. Steaks, fish, hanger steaks and incredible side dishes (probably some of my favorite in Austin) like green chili cheese grits and Yukon potatoes gratin. My ideal meal here is to start off with the wild boar ribs, accompanied by a drink special or the michelada (really nice with Negra Modelo), move on to the hangar streak with my favorite sides (or the halibut special when they have it), have another cocktail, and then have one of their incredible fried pies (and I don't even like desert!) Very fun to come here when they have a band upstairs and enjoy the music. Note that they do have reserved seating upstairs for the band (with full menu), but it can be really noisy (think not being able to speak to your friends loud). Downstairs is loud enough to enjoy yet will not prevent conversations. Service is typically good, but there is the occasional bad apple. I've probably eaten here 30 times now, and I did have one bad food experience as well. I've had friends who also love this place but occasionally get something that isn't perfect. My recommendation is to send it back and try something else if that happens. \\n\\nFantastic Sunday brunch as well! No parking, so find somewhere on the street and walk off those drinks. Upstairs turns into more of a bar/lounge later at night, with awesome local bands.    This place can get pretty packed, so make a reservation if you have a group or don't want to get turned away.

The pizza has a refried bean sauce and was totally satisfying, thinner crust but not at all burnt or crispy. The Greek salad was big and very fresh, and I liked the breadsticks; they were hand rolled, crispy, and soft in the middle.I can't speak for the wings because they were for my boyfriend, but he seemed happy...was kind of funny that the side was chips instead of celery ?

You can sure tell the difference between a pizza that comes straight out of the oven and one that has taken a 10-minute ride in a Ford Escort.  Seriously, people.  It's cheap, too--about 7 bucks for a large pizza with toppings.  The cookie dough comes in a little tub and is delicious.  It never makes it into the oven.  Just grab a spoon and pass it around.  The cheese sticks and cinnamon sticks are equally amazing.  Mmmm.\\n\\nBTW--the first time I went here, I was kinda curious, like the other reviewer.  My son and I walked in and the manager told us about their concept and offered us a free pizza.  We took it (duh!) and he said to tell our friends and come back if we liked it.

She said the nature of the restaurant is just this seating style, but she told us to wait at the bar and ten minutes later she got us a nice table.

Including my own, which I did not fuse about. She told this group they had to leave and pulled there drinks, this was at 1:55. I work at a bar and never would my staff nor management allow this service. The way she aggressively told people to leave and physically took there drinks personally surprised me. When she came to our table she asked if we were done, my girlfriend was quickly taking the last drink from her beer before she could even give it up the server, who was short with dark roots and light blonde hair physically and aggressively took the can of IPA out of her hand before we could even answer her. \\n\\nI'm not one to ever write yelp reviews because I feel they're unfair and can be rude, but I'm very unhappy with the service and my experience.

For the first time, I chose to forgo my usual chicken dish and try the enchiladas. They were awful. The whole plate was cold, the chicken had no flavor and it was just bad. I set the plate off to the side of me after moving the food around a bit and having only two-three bites. She came by several times and glanced at our table often but never once did she make mention of the food being untouched. Didn't even offer a box to take it home.

Unfortunately, we didn't like any of the dishes we ordered. Not even one. \\n\\nAll the main dishes were very salty and the bow tie pasta in the mac & cheese was undercooked. It was beyond al dente...it was still a bit too hard. The pierogi doesn't have much filling it in and the filling was inconsistent. The first one I ate was almost all skin, but the second one had slightly more potato filling.\\n\\nWe had planned on ordering dessert, but passed after all the disappointing food.\\n\\nThe service was not very good either, as the waiter seemed quite insincere in his interactions with us. A table next to us even complained about their service (with the same guy).\\n\\nI'm not sure why our experience was so much different than other Yelpers, as Yelp usually doesn't steer me wrong.

The food court at the mall leaves little to be desired and no where else can you find the yummy warm oatmeal bread the CCF serves before your meal. (you also get a little loaf of sourdough) The portions of everything are so huge and the price is so medium. I advise ordering an appetizer for a meal or splitting an entree. Even the salads are gigantic! You basically get an entire garden. The menu is actually a short book of cocktails (I like the peach Bellini,) appetizers (the sweet tamale corn cakes are to die for,) salads (even the plain garden salad is tasty,) entrees (chicken stuffed tortillas are so bomb,) and of course cheesecake (I enjoy the strawberry cheesecake or the Linda's fudge cake.) Just remember that if you just can't stuff anymore food into your belly, you can always have dessert to go.\\n\\nA few things to keep in mind when dining at CCF:\\n     Expect a wait. It's by far the most popular establishment in the mall so you can expect to be on at least a 30 minute waiting list during peak dining hours. \\n    Expect to spend quite a bit of money if you order alcoholic beverages and dessert because they are not cheap and add up fast!\\n    Be aware that the waitstaff isn't always top notch but you'll always get your food in a timely manner. The one time we didn't, the manager came by and picked up the check for us.\\n    And if you work or live in or near the mall you can always order take out. You might have to hold for 5 minutes before someone takes your order but it's worth it. If you order a beverage on take out, make sure they remember to give it to you because they have forgotten mine on multiple occasions."},{"name":"Posies Bakery & Cafe","address":"8208 N Denver Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Every time I've gone to Posie's they have gotten my order wrong and then been pissed at me about it.

The counter woman said, \\"well next time you should ask for that because it doesn't really work to put it in after.\\" I did, I thought. Perhaps next time you should not get stoned before coming to work so you can listen better. The next time I asked for a bagel and cream cheese and while it was annoying that it took 15 mins to get (coffee now cold) when I did there was no cream cheese. I walked back in and told the woman that I had ordered a bagel and cream cheese and she snapped \\"well it only said bagel\\". She snatched it from me, put some cream cheese on and then came back and and without looking at me shoved it in my hand turned and stomped back into the kitchen. Hmmmm okay. When you get service like this you have to wonder maybe the person was just having a bad day and that's cool everyone does, but maybe the management there isn't very kind.

I saw this truck highlighted on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. My visit this past week was less than eye opening. I didn't get the feature menu item, the fish and chips and opted instead for some of the sandwiches. The chicken fried oyster sandwich is a good idea and the oysters were on the money. Lightly battered, you still get the full flavor of the oysters which were meaty. However, the other parts of the sandwich were pretty plain. The bread may have been freshly made, but also could have been standard store made hamburger buns. The mayo was probably homemade and did complement the oysters well, but there was way too much of it. The other item I tasted was the roasted chicken sandwich, which as far as I could tell was a plainly roasted thigh on a standard hamburger bun, lettuce and mayo (again way too much). Didn't seem like much creativity with this sandwich.\\n\\nThe one consistent critique of this truck in many of the other yelp reviews is the prices. $9 for the chicken sandwich and $10 for the oyster sandwich, both the size of a typical hamburger.

So there is no way for me to look you up. Like what kind of a system  and service is that in which you can't provide an update to your guest.  The hostess outside was way nicer and helpful. \\n\\nFor such a huge place they do not have enough restrooms like why would people have to wait 10 min on line to use the restroom. \\n\\nThe food at this place is not even worth going for or waiting over an hour and half for as it is sub par and has no quality to its food. It's by far the worst eats in Austin which is a shame. \\n\\nThe service was probably the worst part of this place. It outs beat the food as we received so much attitude and horrible service. For such a huge place have more waiter/waitresses. I don't even know how they make money with the service they provide. Our waitress was slow and incompetent. Normally I don't like to use harsh words but she got the orders wrong and didn't give anyone the correct items we ordered. She kept handing off the dishes and drinks by one end of the table instead of individually handing each person their order. She charged us for something we didn't get and was confused when we asked her why we were charged twice. She didn't even place one of the dish orders and when we sent the bill back to get updated she forgot to bring back an updated check. Also she only checked up on us every 45-60 min.  How would we ever be able to get refill and such as there were no other waiter or waitresses working in the vacinity either. \\n\\nThe outdoor seating is even a longer wait and honestly I don't think it's worth it. People say this place is good for drinks but I wasn't impressed.  There is a separate line you stand on to get drinks and there is no real place to hang/chill outside.  Actually there not much waiting space in general. All in all if your visiting from out of town and have other places on your list I would keep this on the way bottom if you really have an interest in going here."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks","address":"1123 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"1 star for a cool vibe. \\n\\nMy friends and I were here on a Friday afternoon.

I don't even know how much each dessert on average costs but it seems a bit expensive, but then again I always order a whole boxful as if I'm picking candy from the store window without even thinking how much I've already gotten. I've wanted to sit down here to have a drink with my dessert too, but never been able to since it gets so crowded, wish they could do something about this. Sometimes the people are incredibly patient with my indecisiveness, other times they've wanted to push me along.

There were people queuing up repeatedly for things like prime rib and turkey that just never appeared. \\n\\nIn their favor, the wait staff was pleasant and the manager made the rounds to apologize to unhappy diners, which was most of us.

The shio ramen broth was surprising flavourful! It was light and not greasy. The noodles were chewy. There was a fully cooked half an egg. I would have preferred a soft boiled egg. There were also bamboo shoots, corn, seaweed, green onions and four pieces of chashu. Yes, four, albeit smaller, pieces included for the price of $7.55! The chashu had fat marbling but it was not as tender as I would have liked. The price point made  the bowl of ramen to be worthwhile to eat.\\n\\nIs this the best ramen I have ever tried? No, it is not. But in Burnaby, this is definitely a winner! No need to drive to downtown unless I want a downtown adventure.  No need to drive 5 minutes away from Metrotown along Kingsway for ramen unless I want to. I can shop and grab a quick meal of ramen at one stop!\\n\\nI would comeback to this food stall when I am craving ramen and I am in the area. This tastes much better than the one ramen restaurant in the Metropolis at Metrotown mall. \\n\\nNow for other points of the location I do not like. Crystal Mall tends to be a busy. I wish there was more seating available as the food court seating fills up fast during peak hours. You either have to keep pacing around in circles looking for a table to be freed up (while your food gets cold), find a table first and sit there while your friends order food first or you have to have the courage to ask strangers if you can join their table to eat your food (if you are eating alone and okay getting rejected).

She then proceeded to go to the table next to us (she only had 4 tables), who already had appetizers and drinks, and proceeded to talk to them socially. We then sat another 5-10mins to have her come back to us to ask us if we wanted a drink. We gave her our drink orders and asked for menus. She came back 20mins later with our drinks and walked off...no menus, no silverware...no nothing. After another 5mins, she came back by and asked if we needed anything, so I politely reminded her about the menus. She then came and brought the menus and went back to socializing with the table next to us. She finally came back to us to ask if we were ready to order...I informed her we had menu questions that she answered. Took our order and walked away. I could go on and on about her lack of attention to any other table, besides the one next to us, and the extensive wait for food, items requested with food (I asked for bread with my soup and never got it...we ordered a sushi roll as an appetizer and it came out before dessert time); however, it won't change the disappointing experience at Kona Grill tonight.

Presentation is very nice in that the avocado slices, imitation crab, cucumber, flying fish roe etc is arranged in a little dome shape.  A bit too much mayo.\\n\\nNaruto roll: Pretty much the same ingredients as the avocado salad, arranged differently.  Imitation crab, avocado, wrapped around a cucumber shell with fish roe on top.  I would pass on this one.  Nothing special, very generic ingredients.\\n\\nSushi boat for four (chef's choice): Sushi pieces are small.  Small cuts of fish for the sashimi.  Sashimi included salmon, mackerel, and whitefish.  Nigiris were mostly high end stuff like toro, whitefin tuna, etc.  The boat seemed lacking the :\\"wow\\" factor and the small pieces left us wanting more before we even started.\\n\\nBombay Roll: I believe its essentially a tuna, eel, avocado roll decorated with some sort of sauce.  I generally frown on sushi with sauces because the sauce takes away from the natural taste of the seafood but this roll tasted pretty good.  \\n\\nAt the end, Ginza left us wanting more for the price we paid.  It's sad that there isn't a quality sushi place in Chinatown anymore.  You have to go into the burbs to find great sushi.  Ginza was the only place that maintained some sort of standard but I feel like the only standard that they uphold now are the prices.

I didn't catch his name but he was extremely polite and helpful.\\n\\nAnyways onto the food:\\n\\nThe menu is pretty standard thai though decidedly less expensive by a good 1-3 dollars per entree compared to almost all other Thai restaurants in Austin without skimping on the portion size.\\n\\nThe dishes:\\n\\nV2 Som Tum (Papaya Salad) ordered at 3-pepper spicy. This dish was pretty great. Papaya was crisp and it's a bit less sour and more fishy than the norm. There was a lot of red pepper chunks in it (which may be because we ordered it extra spicy). Can't really complain about this but it's a good time to mention that their spice levels go from 1-3 and the 3 was enough to make my lips and throat burn for about a half hour after we left. We highly recommend ordering a side of sticky rice to go with this.\\n\\nV3 Larb (Pork) ordered at 2-pepper spicy. This was my favored spice level and was a pretty standard ground spicy seasoned meat with onion served over lettuce and a side of steamed rice. If you like Larb you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nN1 Tom Yum Moo Noodle Soup (pork) ordered at 2-pepper spicy. This soup had a nice porky broth and the crushed peanuts were a nice touch. I particularly enjoyed the chewy texture of the rice noodles as they are often too soft for my liking at other places. \\n\\nThai Iced Tea: This is an acquired taste unless you by default like excessively sweet beverages. It is basically a strong tea sweetened with condensed milk. This one was quite aromatic and helped save me from the papaya salad spice.\\n\\nOverall, It was a very pleasant experience and I highly recommend you go there and give it a try. I think when it's all said and done we probably still like thai taste and IM Thai better for ambiance reasons but when we're not craving dishes unique to those places, M Thaitown has way better prices and the food is pretty great."},{"name":"Bun Cha Ca Hoang Yen","address":"5083 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Team Joe's House came here for some pregame and I had the Bun Cha Ca with a side of spring rolls.

The ingredients used (fishcake, tomato, dill leaves, tofu, and water celery) were very absorbent of the broth and the noodles were a thicker kind compared to pho. To my pleasure the giant bowl went down very easily and the noodles chewy and not brittle (looking at you, Pho Hoa). It was a different style of pho than I was used to, but it was delicious.

The mac and cheese and cole slaw were beyond expectation, too. I'm not a big fan of creamy slaws, so the light-but-sweet vinegar dressing was a winner in my book.

A friend recommended I try \\"Clover\\" (http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/) here in Burlington since they make everything fresh on the spot, yet fast. I read they have no freezers in their kitchen and their menu changes daily (somewhat) based on what ingredients they have on hand. I was curious as to how they operate, so I went. I walked in and noticed a giant digital menu on the wall, there were only a handful of choices so after scanning the menu, I went with a chickpea fritter sandwich and a banana soda. The cashier used a cellphone and a card reader to take the order. To me this is a great idea as there is no need for large registers, and the cashier can take your order anywhere, as opposed to making the customer queue up in a small area to order. The wait time was about 3 minutes and they cut up all the foods in front of you. Unlike Subway's, where the food sits in the little containers and they put it on your sandwich when you order, Clover folks actually cut up the veggies in front of you. \\n\\nWhile waiting I scanned the menu and noticed everything was vegetarian. All the \\"meat\\" sandwiches had \\"soy\\" written next to it, like the \\"soy BLT sandwich\\". I checked myself in and saw that it's under \\"vegan restaurant\\". So I guess this is my first vegan joint. So after getting me sandwich I much say, this is one of the best sandwiches I've had. Everything in it was quite tasty. When you take a bite, you can tell exactly what you're eating. Carrot, onions, chickpea, cabbage, tomato, cucumber...  You can taste each ingredient in the sandwich. The banana soda was pretty good. The banana taste isn't overwhelming at all. I was expecting a sweet blast of banana, but nope. \\n\\nOverall it was good experience. Price isn't bad. Sandwich and soda was $8. Only other place you will beat in portions for that price is a chinese restaurant. I would definitely go again.

Incidentally, I could say the same thing about John Travolta, although I am not constantly faced with the dilemma of whether or not I should put him in my mouth. (Although I can't say the same for his wife or a few gay masseuses). In any event. I don't mind a nice, calorie-laden pepperoni pie now and then, but this time around I thought I might think outside of the [pizza] box. \\n\\nPromise Pizza is unassumingly nestled in the same Great Hills shopping center as Sprouts and Michael's. I've always meant to make it a point to stop at Promise after my errands of acquiring pistachio nuts at Sprouts or some completely unneeded hatboxes at Michael's, but I could never seem to muster the energy after I was through with those extremely taxing tasks. \\n\\nI found myself late for the 1:55 showing of \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\", so I purchased my tickets for the 3:00 and decided to kill time at Promise. It all worked out, in that I needed to consume pre-cinema energy, as this would be a \\"working\\" movie; I had to be prepared to jot down pointers on how to be more of an evil queen than I already am.   \\n\\nPromise is a tiny little place, with no more than a couple wrought iron tables outside and another couple of tables inside along with a bench. It isn't the most sprawling of set ups, and I felt a little \\"on display\\" while eating in such a small space, but for a pizza joint like this it kinda works. \\n  \\nTheir menu is pretty straight forward, with a selection of specialty pizzas or the ability to build your own. However, this is where Promise Pizza's claim to fame comes into play. Here is where you can choose from white or whole wheat crust; request gluten free crust; or, you can request Vegan toppings such as their Vegan cheese Daiya, a 100% plant based cheese that sounds interesting (for someone else to try). No matter what your selections, all doughs and toppings are listed as \\"organic and all natural without traces of pesticides, injected growth hormones, antibiotics or unnatural preservatives.\\" Additionally, their mission statement includes a devotion to social responsibility, utilizing environmentally conscious facilities (Aha! That explains the no frills interior), along with their eco-friendly delivery cars. \\n\\nI'm actually quite shocked now to discover there is no pizza topped with granola here. \\n\\nI was drawn to The Lone Star, topped with \\"Texas-sized\\" pepperoni, Canadian bacon, mushroom, green Pepper, red onion, and tomato. And even though it was a dine-in order, Promise Pizza still delivered. (As a bonus, I was actually able to watch the guy make my pizza behind the counter). \\n\\nEvery bite felt \\"clean\\" somehow. Maybe it was the fresh tomatoes, the generous helping of vegetables, and the fact there was little to no grease that contributed to this feeling. Thankfully for me, taste was not sacrificed on the altar of a crunchy, environmentally-friendly food deity...which happens so often in similar cases. Take a look at the picture I took and tell me that doesn't look delicious. \\n\\nJust a note: The employees were all friendly, relaxed, and laid back. They made sure to follow up and make sure I was indeed enjoying my meal.\\n\\nIt was an exquisite pizza...one that was perfectly proportioned, leaving me feeling wholly satisfied, yet totally devoid of guilt.

They also call your name so you can pick up your order too which is convenient so you don't have to keep waiting. \\n\\nEach donut is hand made, and the outside is crispy with a little crunch then a soft inside. The best thing is that if you are tired of overly sugary donuts or where you can taste the oil, these are great for you! The donuts themselves are flavored with spices like nutmeg, cardamom, and vanilla- original, selections. The donuts are not oily and you can really taste the toppings or flavors you get too. They really are best fresh!\\n\\nThe chai flight is a great intro to their drinks and a variety for the first time! You can get them either hot or iced and while I got them iced, the ice did dilute some of the flavor as time went on and at times could not taste the flavors because it would taste more like plain chai. So next time will try a drink without ice and that is also recommended on the chai flight menu that describes each drink.\\n\\nFor the first time, it was a great experience and will have to come back dor my birthday and when other seasonal flavors are in.

Sometimes we do Saturday morning too. Sometimes, when school's out, we do dim sum every other day. I'm a bit of a dim sum snob.\\n\\nAnd I've stopped eating dim sum on the East Coast because, ever since the first time I've been to China Pearl, about ten minutes into any dim sum outing I just sigh and wish that I was at China Pearl instead. Seriously, I cannot think of one dim sum place in New York, Philadelphia, New Jersey, Baltimore, Chicago or DC that is remotely close to China Pearl in quality and atmosphere. There used to be a small place in NYC that was as good as China Pearl but it has long since changed management and the food went downhill from there.\\n\\nSo, basically, China Pearl is the only place I've found in this country that captures the quality and atmosphere of a real Hong Kong dim sum parlor. The food is 100% authentic Cantonese and not \\"influenced\\" by other areas of Chinese cuisine like most dim sum places in the US. All the classical dim sum dishes can be found if you go there on a weekend. It doesn't try and do crazy experimental dim sum and sticks with what worked in Hong Kong for the last few decades. It's big (two floors!!!), it's noisy, it's filled with ladies yelling out food names and pushing carts and on weekends all the eight-people tables are filled. Oh, and the food is amazing.\\n\\nNow, that's not everyone's cup of tea, I understand that. Some folks don't want a noisy place and would prefer their dim sum Shanghai flavored, for example. That's great. There are other places for that. But if you want 100% authentic Hong Kong style dim sum China Pearl is the only place I have found in this country that does the job.\\n\\nNote: I'm in Seattle now and am slowly exploring the dim sum places here. So far, not optimistic. Heading down to San Francisco later this summer, so hopefully I'll find something that can rival China Pearl there..."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Super YUMMY breakfast!

It did not disappoint! I arrived on the back end of brunch (forgetting it was a brunch day) and there was no wait nor was it packed. The atmosphere is friendly and you're able to hold a conversation fairly easily.\\n\\nOnce seated, my server, Mercedes, was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, including the drinks. She made a few recommendations, after I asked for them, and I went with what she suggested. I got the Shandy cocktail drink, which happened to be her favorite, and I found out why it was recommended. It's crisp, smooth, and refreshing for a hot day. \\n\\nFood wise, I went with the Breakfast Sampler/Platter. I chose the brisket option (naturally in Austin) and added two pork ribs on the side. Let me tell you...the whole platter is superb! The eggs and potatoes were cooked to brunch perfection! But the brisket...that brisket stole the show. It was tender and moist and could be cut with my fork. Paired with their house BBQ sauce was like a Mr. & Mrs. Smith combination. My tastebuds may have cried a bit actually. Also, I may be using some colorful examples, but I'm really not exaggerating. It was amazing!\\n\\nLastly, i dug in to the Pork Ribs. They use fennel and coriander during their process and it creates a nice sweet, yet savory flavor to it. The ribs have just the right toughness mixed in with the soft, tenderness to remind me I'm chowing on ribs. They also are 3oz each, so not the typical size you may be used to. Well worth it, but be wary of the size when you order them separately. Combined with the BBQ sauce qas also great, but just a notch below the brisket.\\n\\nSparkNotes: This place is amazing! The food and drinks (brunch wise) are delicious and the armosphere is great for most any occasion. The service is also on point, especially Mercedes, so be thankful if you get her.

Despite the glass-panelled fa√ßade, a clear view of the PD's interior was well occluded by the translucent sheen of grease we had become so accustomed to in the seedier establishments of Berkeley. Upon entering, one is immediately confronted with an imposing ordering counter, above which hang haphazard and grease-soiled menus. These menus, despite being produced by the well known restaurant menu conglomerate \\"Omega Menu,\\" lacked organization, with discontinuous numbering between adjacent sections. This, combined with the multiply degenerate numbering scheme and plethora of typos, led us to conclude that Omega Menu should stick with its native Greek. \\n\\nUpon ordering, patrons were given tickets with a printed number, raising hopes that PD's rough exterior hid a well organized kitchen. Our hopes were quickly dashed by prominent signage informing us that \\"Ticket numbers are identifiers only,\\" and that the \\"Sequence [was] subject to change\\" without notice. Clearly the uselessness of this system this had been a source of customer frustration in the past, leading PD management to add the tiny inscription, \\"Please do not harass staff.\\" \\n\\nDespite these ominous warnings, our food arrived within 2 minutes with a quality reflective of its terrifyingly rapid preparation. The mango lassi ($2.5) was too sweet and lacked sufficient viscosity, and the batura ($4) tasted a bit too much like fried dough from a carnival. The nan ($2) had the consistency of tough meat, was served at below room temperature, and tasted liked rubber; and while the pakoras ($2) felt edible, they were tasteless nonetheless. The goat curry ($11) lacked spice, and was not very tender. The vegetarian eigendish aloo gobi ($6) contained disintegrated cauliflower and overcooked potato, and lacked spice. The only redeeming portion of the meal was the the chana masala ($6) (also referred to as chole masalewala), but this item was sent to us in error, presumably due to confusion caused by the redundant menu numbering system.  \\n\\nThe generally seedy interior d√©cor reminded us of HOCOD in Berkeley, with the familiar grease-film-coated cups, salt shakers, and serving utensils. We were also surprised (or perhaps not surprised?) to find a blocked emergency fire exit, and risqu√© wall art featuring well endowed deities. The water, dispensed from an exceedingly slow fountain, did not taste like H2O, leading us to suspect significant contamination, perhaps from roadside pollution. \\n\\nGiven the numerous missteps in both food quality and ambiance, we have no choice to but to award PD only 2 samosas; with 1 rupee prices, this leads to the unremarkable samosa-to-rupee ratio of 2.0.  PD claims to be an \\"Indian Highway-side Cafe.\\"  \\"Highway-side\\" is indeed appropriate, as PD manages remarkably faithfully to reproduce the filth, congestion, and disorganization surrounding such establishments in India, but with none of the charm or renowned fare."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If an albino Jackie Chan took Starbucks out behind the Jr High, in 9 months (or whatever the gestation period of a \\"Starbuck\\" is) you'd have an infant Kick Butt Coffee.\\n\\nI've only been once, but the inside is what you'd expect if a local Starbuck hired a narcissistic Ralph Macchio as interior designer.

The side of house made chips were terrible compared to my favorite Cafe 1739.

The risotto had lots of mushrooms and was fresh, while the chicken was tender.  This would be a reorder as well.\\n\\nValue.  Seems that Disney is back to raising the food prices.

I love the countries. We spent all day last Tuesday going back and forth between the old school rides and the new ones and then wandering around the world. It was educational and fun but terribly exhausting. By the time our dinner reservation at Le Cellier rolled around (8:25), my feet were falling off and I was just so thankful to collapse into a chair.\\n\\nOur waiter, George, was also a sommelier and recommended a Lassiter wine to go with my filet mignon. The red blend was paired on the menu but I didn't see it. So thank you, George. The wine was perfect--a granache, syrah blend.\\n\\nThe fianc√©e and I had enjoyed a very big lunch earlier in the day at Viva Napoli, so sadly, I was not as hungry as I could have been. But the Disney Dining Plan takes no prisoners! Either you get the food that is coming to you or your prepaid meals go to waste. \\n\\nThough the food was outstanding, at Le Cellier, I am disappointed in myself  for being too stuffed to appreciate it for what it was. Don't get me wrong, I still ate a lot and loved it! I just don't know where the hell any of it went and I'm not sure my taste buds were up to par. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, I had the scallops and the fianc√©e had Le Cellier's signature cheese and bacon soup. George told us that the soup has been on the menu since they opened 30 years ago! When I tasted it, I immediately understood why. Listen here if nowhere else in this review: GET THIS SOUP. Eat it, love it, and dip that awesome pretzel bread in it. Swirl it around in the bowl and in your mouth. Yum.\\n\\nMy scallops appetizer was okay. I was too much in love with the fianc√©e's cheese soup to care that much about them. The first couple bites of my scallops were unimpressive actually. But that was when I was eating them plain. I then swirled the remaining two scallops around to catch up all the juices in the plate and that was when the getttin' got good. Much better.\\n\\nWhen my steak came, I was not as excited for it as I should have been. It looked very pretty sitting there on top of the mushroom risotto but it took an effort for me to pick up my fork and knife. Lame. \\n\\nCutting into the filet was more difficult than it should have been. Perhaps this was my fault as I asked for it medium and not medium rare. But I had to forcefully tear it a little and when it came apart, I noted that the mid-section was indeed not as pink as I would have liked it. Again, totally my fault for ordering medium. But it did have a nice char on the outside and when I mixed the meat with the risotto and took my first bite, I didn't give a damn that I wasn't hungry anymore. In that moment, I made myself hungry. I ate it all.\\n\\nOne complaint - anytime I went to rest my knife on my plate, it would slide right into the dish. That was annoying. Though I did love the look of the plate itself, perhaps it was a little too big for the meal? Or maybe I'm just a moron.\\n\\nSipping the wine in between steak bites here was (and often is) the best part of the experience. George was absolutely right about the Lasseter Chemin de Fer wine. He mentioned that it was a blend that John Lasseter himself brought to Le Cellier and gave to him personally. I didn't know who John Lasseter was but George explained that he's the CEO of Pixar. I guess he knows wine as well as computer animation. Who knew?\\n\\nThe fianc√©e had a rib eye steak which was delicious as well, though she couldn't do justice to it. It is huge and could probably only be eaten in its entirety by someone who hasn't eaten in weeks.\\n\\nFor dessert, the fianc√©e absolutely loved her maple flavored cr√®me br√ªl√©e. My stomach was on the verge of exploding and I really didn't want to order any dessert but again, the Disney dining plan deems it so. So I had the white chocolate cheesecake. It was terrible. In fact, it is the reason why Le Cellier gets 4 stars instead of 5. Granted, I have said over and over again that I wasn't hungry but even if I had been, I couldn't eat this cheesecake. It was chalky and the consistency was all off. There was a filmy layer on top of it and I just did not understand what the dessert was supposed to be. The presentation was nice at least. It was drizzled with raspberries and sauce. The look didn't do anything for the flavor unfortunately. Just a fail. Don't get it.\\n\\nEverything else was outstanding though. And then we left the restaurant and caught the second half of Epcot's unbelievable firework show. It was a brilliant touch to the end of an extremely gorging meal."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Mother's for breakfast is a must whenever we are in Portland.

In town for a funeral, had flown in from Bay Area CA. Upon arriving, there's a garage attached to the hotel w/signs for Valet or Guest parking. Chose Guest & drove up several floors to park. Then walked around trying to find a way to get out of the garage, while dragging our luggage behind us, finally found an elevator. After entering the elevator it was not clear how to get into the hotel, so chose Mall entrance. Elevator let us out into an indoor shopping mall (which was closed at that time) we just kept walking thru the mall until we eventually came upon the hotel lobby entrance quite by accident down some escalators to the check in desk. Not very convenient. \\nWhile checking in were told we had a dble queen room, but explained we had asked for a King room. Don't recall exact room rates, but it was $300+ Sun, $400+ Mon when booked. Desk lady said something about Expedia reservations are always messed up, & kindly offered to upgrade us to what we wanted. Cool. She put us on the 34th flr, & warned us it was next to the elevators, we didn't care. Went up to the room (again weird elevator w/no instructions, but figured it out!) Room was clean but Very Small (for the price.) 1 bed, 2 night stands, 1 dresser w/a small TV on top, 1 desk w/chair, & 1 small armchair. Bathroom was Small as well w/single sink, toilet, & standard shower/tub combo (no vent fan, 1 of the vanity bulbs was burned out), Small closet which we discovered to access the closet, the bathroom door had to be shut. Nowhere to put suitcases except on floor or bed. Were pretty disappointed considering the price we paid, & compared to other Marriotts we've stayed in. \\nThe positive aspect was an absolutely Spectacular view of Boston. Big windows across one wall, which was very pretty at night. Nice gym, indoor swimming pool, public hot tub, & big sports bar/restaurant set up w/many TVs showing sports, none of which we used due to time constraints. \\nHad been @ hotel maybe  1/2 hour. When exiting, garage attendant says \\"$10.00 please.\\" We explain we are guests at the hotel, he said it didn't matter, all parking charges were the same for everyone, again disappointing, but of course we paid. $38.00 per day max, & evidently $10.00 just for driving in, & back out. \\nDinner w/family, back to the hotel exhausted from flying all day, & decided to take showers. Water came out in a drizzle, barely lukewarm. Ran it a few minutes thinking maybe we're on such a high floor it takes longer to warm up, but it never changed, so we made due with the trickle, & said we'd call in the AM to notify them. Next morning, found note under our door stating there had been a pipe burst, therefore the water issues, & to call the desk for a new room key. We called & were told if we wanted a shower, we had to go to the 5th floor & use the Gym showers. UN-Acceptable. While trying to decide if/how we're going to navigate showering @ public Gym on 5th floor, & back up to the 34th floor to get dressed for the funeral, the water miraculously came back on & was hot too, Hallelujah! Showered, dressed, & went down to the breakfast buffet/omelette bar, which was pretty good, so were happy about that.\\nLater, after the funeral, walked across a windowed sky walk, thru the mall to an attached restaurant, Cheesecake Factory, to meet family for dinner. They said they wanted to eat at that restaurant, so it was convenient to have it so close. Hotel is located in a very scenic part of Boston, w/many walkable places to see, & eat. Our stay was too short to enjoy it, but it's probably why the rooms are so pricey? It's located near many frwy ramps, so might be good for coming/going, tho' lots of construction, we found it hard to use GPS, & drove around in circles a bit. Annoying if on a schedule. \\nLeft @ 03:30 am for the airport. Checked out, went where we had entered/exited the last 2 days via 2nd floor, but a big metal gate blocked the mall entrance. Back down to the 1st floor lobby, asked why no one told us not to go that way, the security guard said \\"oh, that's the mall's fault, we didn't do that.\\" So, how do we get to our car? He says just go outside to access the garage. So we walked out, dragging our suitcases up the ramp, & up around the floors to the 3rd level where we were parked. Never saw an elevator anywhere, except right next to our car where we parked thinking it would be convenient for loading our luggage! Haha, joke's on us. \\nAll in all, felt we paid too much for what we rcvd. Not horrible, but won't be in a big hurry to ever stay there again. Maybe if they had offered to comp us for the water issues, communicated more about how to enter/exit the hotel/garage, or if parking was validated for guests it would have felt a bit more like they cared? Too bad because we go to Boston often having family there."},{"name":"Angie's Malaysian Eatery","address":"7355 Edmonds Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"I was told by my S.O. that this little Malaysian place on Edmonds had to be visited, and tonight was the night. Recently I have been craving Malaysian food, especially laksa. It must be the cold weather I'm guessing. Also the piece de resistance would have to be the flaky and chewy roti with curry dipping sauce. I have tried almost all the roti variety the gvrd has to offer, but my favorite would have to be Laksa King's on hastings street. \\nAngie's Malaysian eatery's menu is very limited to about 10-12 different dishes. That's including appies/mains/dessert. We ordered curry puffs, roti canai, chicken curry, curry laksa and hainanese chicken with rice. It was just enough food for two adults and two little ones. \\nThe curry puffs reminded me of the curry pocket you see at maxims bakery but deep fried. \\nWas ok. Roti was average. Laksa was tasty but lacked toppings. It came with 2-3 fish balls cut in 1/2, 2 tofu puffs cut in 1/2, a few pieces of chicken, some julienned cucumbers and bean sprouts. Would have liked to see a few prawns in the mix since they do charge around $9 for it. \\nChicken curry was very fragrant, mildly spicy and pretty tasty. The hainanese chicken came out boneless which I really liked. But did not come out with the green onion and ginger oil which I really like. \\nInstead it was accompanied with a sweet and sour sambal oelek concoction. It was filling and satisfying. \\nAll in all it was a good dinner. \\nWas a little turned off by the menu stating that 10% tip minimum was appreciated. \\nI mean what kind of establishment does that?\\nPrices were average, maybe on the lower side. \\nThe weird part when I had to use the WC, I had to go through the kitchen where the workers were cooking.

I love me some good fried chicken but mostly, I'm disappointed by local offerings. HCT is more than the exception to the rule for me though. They are operating in a completely different realm from most other fried chicken offering establishments in town. Here's why.\\nThe chicken - First off, all 3 flavors, first and foremost actually taste like chicken. Amazing that something that basic can be missing in so many other fried chicken flavor profiles, but it is. The pieces are good sized, tender and juicy and the breading is light and crispy. As far as the three flavors go, they have cold, spicy and holy. Cold still has a little spice and a great flavor profile. Even if you are really sensitive to heat, it will be enjoyable, but don't worry, the sweet tea is free. ;-) If you like a little spice to a moderate level of spice, the cold version will still be nice and of course the other flavors come through a little more. The spicy chicken is pretty spicy. Think the hottest wings at a sports bar chain. For my money, this is where I like it. Too spicy for many probably, but not so spicy that you can't taste the rest. The holy is pretty painful. Both on the way in and out... I would compare the spice level on this to the green papaya salad at Bangkok, or a really spicy Ethiopian dish. If you want some heat and are worried about the spicy chicken, don't worry. They have amazing, house made ranch dressing for dipping, or pouring over the chicken, piled up high on your white bread. The dressing is creamy and has a nice herb and cracked pepper flavor profile.\\nThe sides - I mentioned the ranch dressing(as much as you need for free), as well as the free sweet tea, but wait, there's more! And if you call within the next 10 minutes... Wait, scratch that. There is more though. Each meal(yes, you do purchase them in meals) comes with fresh, vinegar based coleslaw and delicious, cheesy mac and cheese. The mac-and-cheese should satisfy everyone. It's kind of between a thick, b√©chamel-based, baked mac-and-cheese and a cheesy, gooey, boil noodles and mix with cheddar cheese sauce mac-and-cheese.  Just right to satisfy without taking the spotlight from the chicken. As I mentioned, you also get some slices of white bread to go with it.\\nThe atmosphere - Two long lengths of picnic tables outside, under a pop-up shelter. Perfect for meeting new people and hanging out with fellow foodies.\\nThe owner - Probably part of the atmosphere, but it amazes me how, on a hot day with a packed environment, he and his wife can act so cool, generous and friendly. They make you feel like you are the only one there while managing probably 50+ people. I don't know how they do it.\\nThe amazing - All this talent. All this hard work. All this dedication. All these weekends sacrificed. What's the motivation usually? Accolades? Money? Usually, but not here. These folks are using all of these to give folks a chance to segue back into the workforce. Makes you want them to succeed even more! \\nA few tips - Like I said, the spicy is pretty spicy, not what you might call a \\"medium\\" spice. They open at 12 and serve until they are out(sometimes less than 2 hours), so get there early. They might even serve a little early, so if you come before 12, then you can be sure to either get in line early, or maybe even get served early. This is meant to be a place with a community feel, so be friendly and come ready to chat with your neighbors!\\nYup, 5 stars. Wish I could give more, because this place stands above the rest.
