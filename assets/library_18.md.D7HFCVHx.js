Lets back it up to how I got here. I was searching this fine sight for sushi just to see the rankings are. Then I noticed this place high on the list. I was curious because I live in the area and drive by it a lot. It appears from the outside a chain store or some kind of corporate run Japanese place. I did not get a good feeling. Seeing it almost 5 stars with over 200 reviews I investigated it more. One thing kept popping up was the happy hour specials. I took full advantage. Basically I got rolls for around 4-5 bucks cut into 8 pieces. In addition I had some cheap Nigiri for around 2 bucks a pop. I enjoyed their Nigiri Octopus, Squid, and Eel in addition to the eel roll and Spicy Salmon role. I started off with a cheap appetizer of Chicken Gyoza which I had not tried before (its always been the pork kind). The place was not busy but I guess it was a Monday and I went to happy hour before it ended at 6:30. When I first walked in I was greeted by everyone in the dining room 'hello' or 'welcome' in Japanese. The waitress was always kind and kept refilling my drinks. I had the most up most attention. Even the sushi chefs at the bar asked how I my experience is.\\n\\nLets get down the brass and tax.

I ordered the Vegetarian omelette, which was HUMUNGOUS...I'm not ashamed to say that I ate almost all of it.

It's $15, HH or not.  And I get it during HH, instead of the things that are discounted.  Don't tell them, but a downright STEAL at fifteen bucks.  Just mix it up (or let them mix it for you, after you snap a pic) and use the supplied squares of seaweed to eat it taco-style.  You'll crave it the next day.  At lunch (11-3, seven days), the bento boxes are really great as well.  Don't be fooled by the cheap prices of the bento boxes, and think you'll need to add on a roll to feel satisfied.  You will be fine (though, what the heck, grab at least a piece or two of sushi).\\n\\nThe fish is always prepared well, with nice, even cuts.  Always friendly service, and we've never felt rushed.  We don't even have to BYO-soy sauce, as they have gluten-free tamari available.  Happy hour ends at 6:30, and sometimes at 6:15 there is a wait.  Our benchmark used to be the inexpensive sportsbar-ish sushi place in Round Rock (which we still love, by the way).

But I highly recommend the trout if you come!  We also ordered bread pudding and an assortment of sorbets for dessert.  The bread pudding is really good!  Granted, I've only had it twice in my life, but the first time I ever had it was extremely horrible and tasted like stale bread, so maybe I'm not the best judge of bread pudding.

I booked a reservation and specifically requested a quiet table because a member of my party is hard of hearing.  I made a point of requesting that we not have a table in the center of the room.  When we got there, they tried to seat us in the center of the room and when we requested a different table, they were obviously annoyed.  We asked to be seated in the back room (which was especially quiet), there was a table for four there and it would have been perfect but they wouldn't allow it and made us sit in the loud main room.

I opted for the fries.  It was $22 and a total bargain.

Treats customers with no respect.\\n\\nTo be honest, I'm not the type of person to come on Yelp and trash a business, particularly a local, independently owned business. But I've just had such consistently negative experiences at Athan's, and I can see from other reviews that I'm not alone. Hopefully either 1) the owner/manager will realize people are upset by his behavior and change his ways or 2) consumers can spend their hard earned money elsewhere and avoid these awful experiences.\\n\\nI live in the neighborhood, I love coffee, and I love supporting local businesses -- so Athan's seems perfect. Even though friends had warned me against going there -- the lack of cleanliness of the kitchen and bathrooms, the poor service, the owner not treating his employees well in front of customers -- I thought I'd give it a chance. Unfortunately, all the negative things I had heard turned out to be completely true.\\n\\nBad Experience 1: I was doing some work while drinking coffee at a table, and stayed for several hours. I totally understand the difficult business model of a coffee shop so I'm very good about making sure I continue to order items to 'cover' the cost of my taking up a seat. At one point, after I had already ordered two large coffees, I must have lost track of time and let about an hour pass since my last order. I was literally berated by a member of the staff for \\"taking up space\\" without \\"paying for it\\" and told that I would have to leave if I didn't order something immediately. This was in a 3/4 EMPTY cafe on a Monday evening after I had already spent over $10 there.\\n\\nBad Experience 2: I ordered a large iced coffee to go and the manager/owner rang me up. I didn't have much cash on me, so I tried to pay with my American Express card. He said they had a credit card minimum and I should pick out some pastries to reach the limit. When I explained that I just wanted coffee and, because he hadn't put the order in, would just go somewhere up the street, he backpedaled and said they would \\"make an exception\\" for me \\"this one time,\\" but proceeded to lecture me about how it was very \\"irresponsible\\" not to carry cash and that he wouldn't be willing to do this next time. I responded that people carry cash less & less these days and that credit card minimums are increasingly rare, particularly a place like Athan's that does a high-volume business with a lot of under-$5 transactions. The credit card minimum I get, but the manager/owner's condescending and hostile tone toward a PAYING customer about general life practices was too much for me. I told him that I was all set and went to get a coffee at Cafe Fixe across the street -- and had great service there.\\n\\nBad Experience 3: After the credit card lecture, I vowed to never go back. All the stories I had heard were confirmed, and there are a lot of other options in Washington Square. Why pay to be made to feel like a criminal, rather than a valued customer? But this morning, after six months, I decided to give it another shot. After all, it is a local business, and why punish the employees for the actions of the rude and greedy owner/manager? What are the odds I'll have ANOTHER run-in with him? Well, wouldn't you know it, that's exactly what happened. I was doing some reading at one of the small tables in the front, by the door (in the pastry/cake display area, not in the cafe room in the back). I had been there for a little under an hour and had ordered a large soy latte, which I was almost finished with. A friend of mine was studying at a table nearby. When she came over to chat with me briefly, the owner/manager approached my table and asked if we knew each other. I said that we did. He asked if we would combine our belongings and sit together at one table so that the second table would be freed up for other customers. Now, let me say here that I understand his request -- he's running a business and the more people you can cram into seats, the better. But the tables in the front are tiny. It's basically impossible for two people with reading materials to share one. Second, we were both paying customers. If I continue to buy coffee, I can take up a small table. My relationship with another customer is irrelevant: my obligation is to fulfill my end of the contract, and the establishment theirs. Now the manager/owner was basically asking for a favor -- which, again, I understand, but it's not my obligation to grant him that favor. When I explained that the tables were tiny and it would be difficult to share one while both doing work, he reacted terribly. This escalated into a shouting match between the two of us in front of his customers & staff. It was by far the most unprofessional behavior I have ever seen in a service setting.\\n\\nThere are lots of other options in Washington Square. If you want to be berated and treated with disrespect just for wanting to drink coffee, Athan's is your place. Otherwise, go elsewhere (like Cafe Fixe)."},{"name":"Community Smith","address":"866 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place tends to be my regular spot when I stay at the Renaissance Hotel in Atlanta mostly due to convenience.

In a snap, the side dishes were on the table.  All sorts of fermented and cured goodies were available including a salad.  The main dishes started arriving, before I can finish my second helping of kimchi.  Like the military attempting to land a mess of helicopters on a busy tarmac, the staff cleared plates and moved side dishes, nudged arms and sometimes bodies (my wife) with authority and impunity, barking and coaching and then quickly disappearing and leaving a well organized mess of more side dishes and brilliantly prepared meals.\\n\\nThey were all sizzling, loudly, except for the kimchi pancake that just laid there flat and delicious with the scent of fermentation.  The tofu soup was about to erupt and beckoned someone to stir it.  Everything smelled great; everything tasted great. The  sizzling plate of grilled meat, the arrangement and care not to overcook the sunny side up egg on the bibimbap, not too greasy but tasty pancake, and all sorts of wonderful smells, flavors, and ingredients in the bubbling volcano of tofu and seafood made it a meal to remember especially the next day while savoring the leftovers we brought back to the hotel.

It was delicious and fresh.  The traditional margaritas were delicious - not overly sweet like margaritas from some chain restaurants, which means they used all fresh ingredients - no bright green mix!\\n\\nI, and my entire party, ordered salads.  In fact, all 3 of Rosa Mexicano's lunch salads made it to the table.  The portions were just right for lunch.  We were part of the Empty Plate club, but were not left feeling hungry (although the chips and guac probably helped with that).\\n\\nWe let the server know that were on a time schedule and needed to be out quickly, but the service was still a bit slow - especially at the start of a very quiet lunch hour.\\n\\nI've heard that dinner reservations are booking out weeks in advance.

From reading other reviews it seems like a good place to visit on an off hour.  I expected more crowds, but I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nWe heard so much about this place, and couldn't wait to go.  Honestly, I wasn't disappointed, but at the same time there were a few small details which detracted.  Overall, I was very happy.\\n\\nI can't agree with reviewers here who say the wait staff was inattentive.  Our server was around all the time; he refilled our water bottle like three times, and we kept ordering new items.  We never had trouble finding him.\\n\\nThe food: first off, Austin restaurants serve mostly three types of food.  BBQ, Tex-Mex, and Burgers.  When you find a restaurant that has some different items on the menu, you should support that restaurant to the death.\\n\\nMy favorite was the charcuterie; it was rich and had tons of flavor.  People complain about the green beans are plain, but I rather like them that way.  They were crunchy and cooked just right.  The mussels; yum!  We were slurping the sauce afterwards.  Rabbit stew--very, very tasty.  I do wish there had been a touch more rabbit in it, but really it's a small complaint. \\n\\nMy only complaint food-wise is that the fried chicken, while really yummy, was just a tad undercooked for my taste.  My husband and I always argue about the \\"done-ness\\" of chicken, so maybe I'm wrong.  Literally two more minutes in the fryer and I would have been happy.\\n\\nTo those who don't like the staggered serving.  It's a tapas place!  It's supposed to be like that!  Share your food!  There were five of us and we enjoyed having a taste of everything that came out.\\n\\nWhat else, oh, drinks!  That cucumber drink (Pepino) is my new favorite.  I also had a Pimm's Cup, which was good, but not as good as the cucumber.\\n\\nThe atmosphere can't be beat.  It was hot out that evening, but I tell you I didn't care at all.  The fans and misters and tent kept off the worst of it, and I just love eating outside among the trees surrounded by tiny lights.\\n\\nLast comment; the bill.  It was a LOT less that we expected.

But, the overall meal was very bland. No seasoning, no salt, etc. My husband said the same thing about his meal; bland, no seasoning. We told our waitress, but nothing happened. I was very surprised the owner wasn't more visible to check in throughout the night with his patrons. We will probably stick with our regular Italian restaurants in the future but may give this place another shot in a few months."},{"name":"El Coyote","address":"6965 N Fessenden St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Very much worth it.

First off, I'll never come here again based off of the bottom line. DO NOT BOOK FOR PARTIES OF ANY KIND. We had a party of 18, booked in advance with a credit card on file. The receptionist on the phone, though I'm sure accidental, did not inform us that our whole party had to be on the property to be seated. This was a birthday brunch, on a Sunday. I've never been to a dinner party where everyone was on time, so for this policy to be in place is surprising. We weren't able to inform our guests of the policy due to that mistake, otherwise we would have stressed the issue.\\nWe were told to get drinks in their incredibly small bar area that includes a few dining tables.   So 9 of us are in this tiny area just congregating and making a plea with the manager to let us be seated early. As it's a celebration, we are eager to order apps and drinks to have some fun and celebrate- again, like going to a normal meal out and waiting for your guests to arrive at the table. They wouldn't seat us until we had 13 guests in, again, their extremely small bar area. At this point they've threatened us three times that they were going to cancel our booking- instead of just seating us and letting us rack up drinks and food. Finally the manager lets us get seated and the servers are still setting up our tables- they aren't even together. Our party was divided. I've worked in plenty of restaurants growing up, mid class and steak houses- And regardless of the price point, this was never something I've seen for a large, and reserved in advance, party. At this point, we're eager to get this over with and get out of here. A member of our group tried bringing a cake, which came with a 30 dollar fee regardless if we ate it or not. This is a restaurant on RAINY street, not some struggling restaurant that needs to add over the top fees, or an Michelin Star restaurant. \\nThe food was okay, but the 18 of us have never been more stressed over a BRUNCH RESERVATION. We wont be back- which may not hurt this business, but if there are groups of people who had such a bad experience that they refuse to come back, you have a systemic issue."},{"name":"Dexter's Windermere","address":"4757 The Grove Dr, Ste 100","city":"Windermere","stars":"3","text":"Don't come here if you want to dance!

It's akin to dinner at Al Forno's... except the insomnia might also be a result of stuffing your face with too much delicious food. \\n\\nIt's not much to look at, that's for sure, and walking in one wonders if they're in some sort of marketplace rather than restaurant.  A huge chalkboard hanging above the counter (is this a trend in Alberta Street restaurants, I wonder?)  displays a simple menu of pizzas, calzones, and other options.  Already prepared with the basic fillings of ricotta and mozzarella, another chalkboard lists the fresh toppings of the day for you to choose from to make your meal your own. \\n\\nAfter ordering a calzone with portobella mushrooms and pepperoni, I joined my friends at a little table by the window to watch the evening traffic roll by.  As the last of the warm summer air drifted through the large open doors and was met with the heat from the ovens in the back, a cozy vibe filled the room making it as welcoming as the young guy behind the counter.  We waited for what only seemed like a few minutes before our dinners were served up on big pizza trays.  The blend of cheeses and fillings dipped into a little dish of marinara sauce made for a filling meal, but I wasn't left with that greasy aftertaste that so many similar dishes are guilty of having.   \\n\\nThis place is definitely worth stopping by.  And unlike many of the other restaurants in the area, Al Forno's is open late for dinner.

During my last visit, I witnessed a woman donning a fanny pack, stirrup pants, AND a bedazzled Jesus t-shirt, a lone man who pounded a plate of fried chicken large enough to end hunger in a third world country, and another woman being escorted out by security because she had setup camp at a table all afternoon and refused to leave. In the end, they could probably charge admission to this sideshow and I would still come back.\\n\\nFood: Everything is fried to a state of glorious oblivion. My favorite dish is the Midnight Train, which is essentially a standard waffle with four southern fried chicken wings. Overall, the dish is not spectacular and not even close to being the best chicken and waffles that I've ever ingested. They also tout their wings as \\"jumbo\\", which I have to disagree with after having lived in Buffalo for a decade. Despite the lackluster food, this place is still worthy of a novelty visit, particularly if you have visitors in town and are looking for a memorable experience. \\n\\nService: As others have noted, the wait to get a table at this place will exceed an hour on a good day. However, once you do get in, service is relatively fast and reasonably cordial. I live within walking distance and find that the lines are typically shorter during the weekdays and in the mid-afternoon.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Loud and chaotic. The air is also extremely heavy; I'm still not sure whether it's a result of poor ventilation or the fact that the inordinately large  proportion of morbidly obese patrons is wreaking havoc on the oxygen supply. Clientele is a mixed bag of crazy, but mostly tourists. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive. Appetizers range between $6 and $9, while entrees range between $9 and $13. \\n\\nOther:  Make sure to go inside and give your name to the hostess immediately upon arrival; it often appears that a line is forming outside the door, but these individuals have just grown weak and are leaning against the wall for support while waiting for their name to be called.

My buddy and I even attempted to get his attention a couple times and I'm pretty sure he ignored us. He seemed pretty content chatting up a couple of out-of-towners for most of the duration of our time there. After about 20 minutes he half-heartedly took our food order. He seemed to have the attitude that he was above his job, or customers. Oh yeah did I mention they weren't very busy?\\n\\nAs for the food, it was good but as others have mentioned over-priced.

This was a huge disappointment as I loved the initial design of it and don't think the restaurant feature was really necessary. The food in the cafe is mediocre and not as great as it was the first two times I've been here. I got the matcha latte and the shrimp tempura temaki and I must say the food quality has definitely gone down. The temaki was alright but not much flavor and the matcha latte tasted nothing like matcha which was so disappointing to say the least.

I can't even find the words to describe how disappointed I am after reading the the (mostly great) reviews. I am completely dumbfounded as to how anybody could possibly give this place more than three stars. The only reason this place is getting two stars instead of one is because I don't think we got a food borne illness and it had a cute/quaint ambiance. Overall, every dish had zero depth and was over-powered by ONE ingredient or was tasteless.  I kind of laughed off the other poor reviews when they said the best thing was the bread and evoo with red pepper/garlic/cheese they serve when you are sat....I unfortunately now agree :(  \\n\\nApps-\\n-Goat Chese Dip: You can barely see, let alone taste, the cheese as it is buried in a bowl of pizza sauce (yes the only tomato based sauce I can think of to describe this appetizer that is absolutely nothing like the description on the menu) that has so much red pepper in it your lips go numb....save your $13 and make your own red pepper pizza sauce at home.\\n-Shrimp Gran Gala: menu description \\"Black tiger shrimp saut√©ed with Gran Gala orange liqueur garnished with orange. Sweet and succulent.\\"  The reality is shrimp cooked well, however, smothered in a bland tan colored gravy-type substance with a hint of orange flavoring. Oh, it DID come with the orange garnish! \\nDinner-\\n-Veal Piccata- Two large pieces of veal cooked nicely with a very watery \\"piccata\\" sauce that is extremely over powered by lemon and otherwise tasteless.\\n-Chicken Saltimbocca- Two chicken breasts smothered in a watery balsamic sauce (and no, that is not the sauce for saltimbocca) with a 2inx2in piece of prosciutto for two breasts of chicken.\\n\\nWe paid extra for homemade pasta for each dinner dish that was so over cooked you could not twirl it on your fork and spoon, because it would simply break apart. We also ordered a side of pasta with marinara. The \\"marinara\\" tasted like it was dumped straight from a can of crushed tomatoes onto the overcooked noodles. Also, granted maybe this is being picky, when I asked for parmesan (desperate for taste) I was handed a cheese shaker that you would get at a pizza place.

When my husband and I asked about the size of a dessert for us to share, the bartender told us the dessert is for one, but if we wanted to share it we could. This didn't answer our question and the response was pretentious and rude. Just give us an idea of the size! Some people eat less than others!!!! In any case, we spoke to the manager and he wasn't helpful. I can't help but feel the bartender judged us because of how casual I was dressed, like I didn't belong there.

I highly recommend making a reservation - there was a bit of a wait for those that didn't have one, and I think we got to sit at a table by ourselves rather than a community table because of this reason.\\n\\nI had combed through the Yelp reviews before going so I would have a good idea of what was a \\"must-try\\" item. I started with the blood orange margarita and my partner got the same thing but mixed with a Fireman's 4 (his fave beer). Very good.\\n\\nFor apps, we got the deviled eggs (YESS! A++ WOULD ORDER AGAIN) and the much discussed Duck Fat Fries. I was let down by the fries. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but they really tasted like regular fries with an egg on top. I like fries, so they were good, but I probably would have wanted a different appetizer in my belly.\\n\\nWe then split the beef shoulder and the brussel sprout leaves. I became deeply infatuated with both items, while my XY counterpart said they were both alright. \\n\\nFinally, we finished the meal with the butterscotch dessert. Butterscotch is my absolute favorite taste in the world. Kevin said it reminded him of \\"old lady's candy they keep in their purse\\". The dessert caused me to let out \\"MMMMmmm\\"s and \\"OH THIS IS SO GOOD\\"s.  \\n\\nOur waiter was perfectly attentive - not annoyingly present and not aloof and missing.

How could I not know where I was in Boulder? Me, the Boulder retail expert among my long time resident peers. I have eaten in this \\"place\\" for years. The sign over the door still says Crepes a la Cart. I could not check in on Yelp under that. The menu says \\"A Cafe.\\"  Yelp let me check in on that. So that is what I will review, but with some history.\\n\\nFirst it was a \\"cart\\" and there still was one at their other location the last time I was at Flatiron Crossing. Then this one moved into a longtime (and I mean decades long) vacant storefront just off Pearl on Broadway and served fast casual style.Then it was a short term interim remodel, adding waiters instead of counter service. Not much nicer, maybe slower to get a meal, but better seating.\\n\\nNow it is a totally different place, nice interior, the menu has been expanded beyond crepes, though all we got were crepes. They are better, fancier, with trendier ingredients, more expensive, but a far nicer presentation. Some greens on the side, more than a garnish, less than a salad, and fuller crepes. The food was really good but the service a little pretentious with a few errors, but polite, with good intentions. \\n\\nI ordered an iced tea. I was brought a pot of hot tea, good Boulder Celestial Seasonings black tea, with a glass with 6 ice cubes. I was told that this is their fresh iced tea system. I could pour the hot tea into the glass, melt the ice and then get more ice to chill it. So I tried. The first pour took it to tepid. The next glass of ice did not appear. I asked for the ice but the waiter forgot until I asked again. I drank the first half of the pot as tepid. It was not bad but not what I wanted.  Then I did get the ice for the second half of the pot. This was annoying and I had a table of out of town guests, who were amused.  Also, the waiter was the \\"I don't need to write it down\\" genre. He had to check back once to verify one of the orders. Not terrible, but not great. Again, the guests were amused. Not a trend where they live.\\n\\nThe waiter was very polite and moderately mature, not a student part time job type.\\n\\nSo my rating is by rationalization.

The total was around 60 dollars, but we definitely ordered a bit too much food since it was our first time here. The bone marrow was delicious and probably the favorite of the night. The chicken liver mousse is sharable between 3-4 people, but since we only had 2, it got heavy and unfinishable. The apple gelee is a really cool addition to the dish, giving it a quirky twang that cuts a bit through the richness of the liver mousse. I really enjoyed that dish. The crisp chicken thighs are well-cooked but nothing special, I make a similar brick chicken dish at home and it was comparably spiced. The potatoes it comes with were well cooked, crisp and slightly sweet from the sauce, but I would not get it gain because of its lack of inspiration. The duck fat fries were good, and the eggs divine. The sauce it came with was delicious, but probably needed a bit more due to the quantity of the fries. Fries were easily sharable between 3 or 4 people. \\n\\nThe creme brulee was good, but the banana fosters was freaking delicious. The bananas were inside the crispy beignets, and I ate the entire thing myself. I wouldn't recommend sharing with more than 1 person, because you'll want a large portion :p.

They had big industrial type fans situated around the outdoor area but for some reason they were not turned on.   We were there during happy hour so we ordered drinks and the special happy hour appetizers.  I had the Salty Sow'r which was real good; actually had 3 because everyone at the table was sampling and the drinks disappeared pretty quickly.  I found that the drink was not that potent.  Since this was our first visit we went overboard and ordered several happy hour appetizers.  We ordered the truffled deviled eggs; the duck fat fries; the crispy Brussels sprout leaves; the honey rosemary dipped fried chicken and the milk-braised pork carnitas taco.  Everyone at the table sampled each of the dishes.  All were good but the ones we liked the best were the chicken and the fries.  For dinner we ordered the beef shoulder (x2), the chicken thighs and the Brussels sprout Caesar salad.  The beef shoulder was excellent; the other two dishes were ok.  We liked the appetizer chicken better than the chicken thigh entr√©e.  For dessert we had the bananas foster beignets which were over the top good.   As you can see we sampled a lot of dishes (we also took left overs home).  The cost with tip was around $170.  The prices for the happy hour are great.  I found that the prices for the entrees were a little on the high side.  We indulged ourselves on this visit.

The ordering experience is a little confusing (options are spread across four or five boards/signs), but we managed to order a margherita pizza, a pepper and onion calzone, and a cannoli.  Drinks, as mentioned elsewhere, are pretty limited (beer is available to-go only), and they seem to believe that things like silverware are frivolous extras that you should have to ask for.\\n\\nThe pizza was fine, but kind of bland.  Definitely needed salt, which wasn't available in the dining room.  The cheese could have used a little more charring to give it some flavor.  As it was, I mostly tasted the flour coating on the bottom of the pizza.\\n\\nThe calzone was pretty good.  Could have been more generous with the sauce and giving us silverware would have been nice.  Despite what other reviews said, there is no real interest in service.  I sort of felt like we were disturbing them by coming in.  Maybe you have to speak Italian to get \\"real service\\".  Anyway, the calzone was tasty, though a little heavier on the ricotta than I like.\\n\\nThe cannoli was all right.  Again, silverware would have been nice to give us, especially since the shell was rock hard.\\n\\nI might try it again, but I will remember to bring my own silverware and salt.  I'd take it home, but the quality of the pizza diminished rapidly as it cooled.  It's certainly well-priced.

The ambience in this restaurant was great. The service on the other hand is another question. For this type of restaurant in this location I would expect 5* from the moment I walked in until the moment we left. For starters,  we had reservations, when we got there we had to wait almost an hour because our section of tables was not cleared. We were under the impression that we could order from the actual menu but we were quickly told rudely, I may add that due to the large party we had there was no way they could service 17 people and 17 different meal courses. We're looking around the restaurant to verify how many other guests are in this location. Suddenly we realized that if we were 17 separate people at sparate tables certainly this restaurant will be able to accommodate 17 different orders. But for some reason they did not want to serve one table of 17 people. And again at this type of location in this type of restaurant we would expect to be served at any number of quantity. The restaurant is overrated and the prices are very gouging. They told us that either we allow them to serve as family style or we had to leave. Family style would grant them gratuity plus a service fee. They were able to get $96 per person from that table of 17 people. Very unacceptable for this type of restaurant I will never dine there again I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The true stand-out at Bin 26 is the wine - there's a HUGE selection, both in terms of types of wines and size of serving.  They have over 50 wines by teh glass which means you can try a bunch without having to commit to the full bottle.  The wait staff are also really knowledgeable about which wine to recommend and I am yet to taste a wine here that I didn't like.\\n\\nIronically given this, you have to order food to be able to drink at Bin 26 because of licensing restrictions.  Kind of annoying, but the food is good too so it's not too onerous.  Definitely expect to pay $$$ though - the food is very high quality and the price reflects that.\\n\\nThe pasta dishes are great: I particularly like the cocoa tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms.  The pasta is perfectly cooked, the sauces flavourful and the portions generous...  The branzino is also a real highlight.  It's a Meditteranean sea bass that isn't too fishy and they serve with light flavourings.  YUM.  Highly recommend getting some truffle mash with it too.\\n\\nThe service is also excellent.  I came here recently with a large (and shall I say it, obnoxious group) and they were super patient and pleasant despite that.  Although I guess we did spend a lot of money.\\n\\nThe only downside of Bin 26 I've experienced was on this same trip, where I ordered a bunch of dishes for the table.  Unfortunately the beef tartare was served and described as \\"prosciutto\\" by the waiter and a friend of mine who can't eat beef for religious reasons accidentally ate some.  This was sort of a big deal - it's the only time he's ever eaten beef, and although they took his portion off the menu, I think he felt the way they handled the situation was not very understanding.  They tried to imply it was his fault when clearly it was not.  So I woudl definitely recommend being very clear with them if there's anything you can't eat.\\n\\nApart from this one incident though, I've been to Bin 26 multiple times and always had a great experience.  The space is versatile enough that you can come here for a catch-up with friends or for that awkward first date.  In both scenarios you'll no doubt thoroughly appreciate the quality and selection of their wine ;)"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Solid food, drinks, atmosphere and service.

I said, \\"The Gold Fox strip club serves Chinese food now?? AWESOME.\\" Nothing goes together better than food and nude dancing by women who seem dead inside, am I right, Kahoots? I was disappointed upon finding out that the strip club was no longer there, and had been replaced by Helen's. I suppose I could give it a shot, especially since all these friends who went to this place together...WITHOUT INVITING ME...told me how awesome it was. No, no...I'm not bitter at all...\\n\\nI walked in, and Helen, the owner, greeted me...because she's really nice, or maybe to distract me from the mirrors everywhere. And they are everywhere. It used to be a strip club. One side of the restaurant had an artistically-painted, multi-paneled hinged screen, which obscures a stage-looking area, where I'm sure a pole existed at one point. It's all cool, though. All the mirrors make the place really bright, and you can see anything or anyone while seated in any part of the restaurant by just looking at any wall...because every wall is covered in mirrors! You know what? The mirror thing is awesome. If you come here for nothing else, come for the mirrors. Although, if you're really self-conscious, or like to fix your hair a lot, then you might be easily distracted.\\n\\nHelen seated me, then asked if it was my first time. \\"Yeah, my friends were here last night, they told me it was really good...\\" \\"Oh, your friends take lots of pictures, so many. Take pictures of food. All of them.\\" I couldn't tell if she was annoyed by that, or flattered. Whatever, it's not like *I* was there with my all my friends, taking pics of food. Hmmph. \\n\\n\\"So...are you of the Asian people?\\", Helen inquired. \\"Yeah...I'm Filipino.\\" A look of concern came across her face, \\"Do you have Chinese friends?\\" \\"Oh, yeah, I do.\\" \\"That's good! You should bring them here!\\", Helen said with a look of relief. I placed my order for the Xiao Long Bao [as other people have said, if you want Xiao Long Bao a.k.a. soup dumplings, this is the place to go...and probably the only place in Columbus to get them], the beef noodle soup [excellent, slightly spicy, and pretty big, like for-two-people-with-leftovers-big], and the spicy chicken wings [straight fried, lightly seasoned wings with delicious thinly sliced fried jalape√±os], they were all out in about 10-15 minutes. Everything was damn tasty, and the dumplings were handmade. You can definitely tell the difference, they're better than any other dumplings I've had in Columbus.\\n\\nYes, I finished everything. Maybe I was drowning my sorrow that stemmed from the fact that my friends didn't invite me to eat here with them, OKAY?!? Or maybe it was because Helen came over to check on me, asking if I needed a box, then would quickly say \\"No you don't. You finish. You good eater.\\" I just couldn't disappoint her, you know? We talked a little bit after I finished. She explained to me about how she wants to be the place in Columbus that serves true, authentic Chinese food. Then she said, \\"Can you help me fix the cash register?\\" She led me to her cash register, and told me she was having trouble opening the drawer. I know a little about operating cash registers--okay, I know NOTHING AT ALL, but I didn't want to disappoint her, you know?-- and tried various keystrokes, but nothing seemed to work. I think the mechanism was being jammed by something. Anyway, I explained that I couldn't help her, and she thanked me for trying, and told me to come back soon...and to be careful driving, something my mom would say.\\n\\nI went there again last week, ordered shrimp & pork dumplings and beef chow fun [\\"It's a wide noodle\\"...I love that quote from Seinfeld]; both were delicious. And Helen told me she now has an authentic Szechuan menu, for those wanting some spice. After finishing everything [again], while walking towards the door, I noticed a table of small gifts for sale near the entrance: some folding fans, some Chinese artwork, and small figures of cartoon characters Hello Kitty and Doraemon sitting on a toilet. No, not on the same toilet. They each had their own toilets. I didn't get to see how much they were, but I may be interested in purchasing one of the toilet figures the next time I'm in. Maybe I'll try the Szechuan menu then, too. And possibly finish everything...again.

Chad recommended the Cabrito Burgers for boysie and me, and the Brisket for Mumsie. While he was cooking, Chad gave us the background on WHY, after running and working in several major eateries in Florida and the Caribbean, he chose to move to Austin last year and open the sweet little shack that is GG.  After listening to Chad tell his story, and savoring the wonderful smells wafting from the grill, we were in love before we'd even sampled the first morsel.  Chad uses locally produced goat/lamb/pork and does his own processing. This really pays off in terms of flavor.  As we mentioned, the food is cooked right before your eyes, and it's a real treat to watch Chad at work.\\n\\nThe Brisket, marinated in Espresso and served with Cabbage, was just MARVELOUS with flavors that ranged from warm and delicate to boldly gourmand.  5 stars for that dish alone. \\n\\nOur Cabrito Burgers were tender, juicy, and oh, what a flavor!

So incredibly impressed! Not only were the appetizers unique and affordable, but the flavor of EVERYTHING we ordered was so good! I fell in love so hard with the Brussels sprouts leaves, that I wound up asking the waitress how they are cooked, I'm going to valiantly attempt them at thanksgiving this year! I also ordered the duck breast. It was perfectly portioned, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. \\nMy husband ordered the truffle deviled eggs. He wasn't ecstatic about them, and felt they needed a little something extra, but he did say that they were good. He also ordered the Wagyu beef burger special and was very impressed.. stating it was a Great burger. He thought the duck fat fries were a bit over salty, but I liked them pretty well. \\nWe totaled $71 (plus tax) for two appetizers, two entries, two mini cocktails, and a slightly overpriced beer. We were just at $90 with a tip. Not horrible for a date night when the food is super worth it. \\nOh... service was great as well."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review of La Barbecue as of yet. This is long overdue. \\n\\nOur first trip came in December 2013 since we didn't want to wait for hours at Franklins.  I honestly thought the brisket was as good as, if not better than the meal I had at Franklins trailer back in 2010. Hard to know for sure 3+ years later, but I couldn't imagine it could be any better. \\n\\nWent again in June 2014 and it was still fabulous. It was my oldest sons first visit and he confirmed it was as good as Franklins. \\n\\nThis latest visit came on February 20th and was the first trip since John Lewis left. I was a little nervous for that reason, plus some Yelp reviews which indicated wait times had risen. We arrived at 9:20am and were the first ones in line!  By 9:40 there were about 40 people in line. By 11:00, the line wrapped all the way around the lot up to the beer table. So yes, we waited an hour and forty minutes, but I'm pretty sure that the people behind us waited longer given the amount of time it takes to place/receive your order (only one cutter/cashier). \\n\\nWe ordered a mixture of lean and moist (heavy on the moist!), one sausage link, one side of potato salad and a couple of blocks of cheese. I'm happy to report that the brisket is still AWESOME!  Can't really compare it to Franklins since its been six years, but I think it is a step up from Pecan Lodge & Hutchins (my favorites in DFW).  \\n\\nIf they can just improve their throughput (two ordering/cashier stations?), it would be perfect."},{"name":"Cactus Grill","address":"44 Maverick Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here for lunch during work for the first time. The rotisserie chicken lord so yummy. So I decided to go with that, yellow rice, and beef empanada. They put my chicken on the grill as if it were a bit cold? But whatever. I sat down with high anticipation of eating this. I cut my chicken open and discovered it was still VERY pink and uncooked on the inside. I went up to the cashier very apologetically for interrupting their flow of service to other people, and I told them that my chicken was still uncooked and very pink. He offered to either give me another rotisserie or other chicken. I asked what other chicken they had, and the guy just said \\"fried\\" and pointed to their cooked food pam area. Some of the stuff, I couldn't tell what I was looking at. So, while I'm looking for another chicken such as regular  grilled, another cool from the back area comes up and asks for my plate. I didn't know what he was doing until I saw him take the uncooked chicken off my plate, and just plop a burnt piece of fried chicken on my plate. I didn't want fried chicken at all, but since we were running out of time for break, I had to just take it, as their line was so long and I had to get back to work. Hope I don't get salmonella poisoning. If so, I know why and where!\\n\\nWith that said, prices are reasonable depending on what you get.

So one of the plus sides to la Barbecue, every one has mentioned, is the free beer as you wait. The day I went, there was a Firestone 805 vendor - crisp, refreshing, perfect starter to the meal. \\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the 1/2 lb. brisket, 1 sausage link, and some pulled pork topped with pickled onions. We ordered all of the sides: chipotle slaw, potato salad, and southwest black bean salad.\\n\\nMeats: I know everyone raves about the brisket, but really it left no impression on me. My friend agreed saying that she could get equally decent brisket from her dad's cooking. The sausage was surprisingly our favorite meat, there was just enough spice and it was grilled to perfection. The pulled pork was good, but again, left  no impression.\\n\\nSides: The sides were okay. My favorite side was the chipotle slaw, which stood out on its own. Though I would prefer a less smoky flavor to complement the meats, as we're already getting enough of the smoked flavor. The black bean salad was just another black bean salad. \\n\\nMaybe we went on a bad day, at a bad time or we somehow got a bad cut of the meats, but the experience was underwhelming.

Loaded with large clams and presented in a very unique manner. To finish things off, I had the panna cotta. Not the best I have had (that goes to Mistral) but still very delicious.

So the \\"not good\\" - I've found the service to be adequate to poor every time I've been.  Typically there are long waits to order if you aren't ready when they feel like taking your order, trouble finding your server for drink refills, and sometimes a whole lot of glaring and eye rolling from the server.  Also on the \\"not good\\" side, the ladies room seems to be perpetually out of toilet paper in at least one stall and half the time there is simply a jumbo roll of paper towels sitting on the counter rather than actually being placed in the dispenser.  \\n\\nMy family and I are big fans of the minute differences in Persian vs. Lebanese vs. Greek vs. Turkish cuisines so we try and order the items where Lebanese cuisine really shines.  This is actually a wee bit difficult as I am slightly disappointed by the entrees at Cedars every time we visit.  The appetizers are outstanding!  And the pitas! It would almost be worth going for the little, piping hot, wood-oven puffed pita breads alone.   They are amazing and we always eat an embarrassing number of them.  \\n\\nFor appetizers, we are fans of the hummus, which is well seasoned and smooth, and the baba ganouj is always mellow, with no bitter hints as eggplant spreads can sometimes have.  I adore kibbeh (little balls of meat and cracked wheat stuffed with more meat and pine nuts) and theirs is excellently seasoned, though a little dry.  On our most recent trip, we tried the Makanek, described as homemade sausages saut√©ed in lemon.  Two members of our party really liked them but the third found the idea of cloves seasoning sausages to be really odd.  I think there was a touch of sumac as well, which I found interesting. \\n\\nSadly, after appetizers most of my meals here go right downhill.  I usually get the mixed grill (one skewer each of the chicken kabob, lamb cube kabob and kafta kabob).  The meats were well grilled, though the lamb was a little tough and the kafta a little dry.  But the huge letdown is always the mixed veg.  For totally unknown reasons, Cedars uses a frozen veg mix of carrots, cauliflower and broccoli which they jazz up a little with garlic.  How do I know they are frozen?  Because they were served to us ice cold on my last visit.  The waitress seemed somewhat annoyed at us for complaining but had the kitchen prepare more, HOT, veg.  Most grilled entrees are served with rice...which is rice.  Not really seasoned but usually cooked well enough you don't pay much attention to it other than as a bed for the meat to nestle on.\\n\\nSo, yeah.  Never outstanding but we keep going back because the appetizers are really good and there aren't very many Lebanese places.  Yet, I always feel a little cheated - that I've paid too much for too little that was really notable.  Maybe one of these days we will start the meal here and then go next door to Seasons 52 for the rest."},{"name":"Gen Sou En","address":"299 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"What makes a good Tea House?

You choose 2 appetizers of your choice among various unique assortments and one main course to go along with it. In no way is the main course smaller because it is a lunch special, every time I go, I can NEVER completely finish the whole meal set. There is also a free drink that comes with the lunch special where you can get thai iced tea, iced pinky (traditional Southeast drink), or regular soda/tea! Personally, I feel like the drinks are nothing special, it is a bonus if you are ever feeling something to drink- Thai iced tea is the only thing I've tried but I felt like it was too watered down? but not complaining next to all the good things I've actually had there!! would def recommend coming with friends and family!"},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"The prices of the Scotch here are excellent and they have an incredible variety of beer and Scotch, as you'd expect.

Any reflux parent knows this is a tough journey.  Figuring out what medicine works, what best to feed your baby, up all night holding and rocking to control the pain in your baby.  \\n\\nWell, we did find a medicine that worked and it was one that People's pharmacy would have to compound.  It worked wonderfully at first but by day 15 we were noticing it wasn't as effective.  The pharmacist agreed to fill my RX every 10 days which worked---at first.  I started noticing I'd pick up a refill and my son seemed worse on a 'new batch of medicine'.  After calling, I found out I was being given a compounded medicine made 9+ days before I called in to refill it.  \\n\\nI politely explained that my son needed a fresh batch made.  WHen the medicine was old, he'd have a horrible acid flare up (screaming, in pain, arching his back and not able to sleep--essentially his esophagus is getting damaged).  The pharmacist agreed to remix it even though she guaranteed it would be a waste of money, claiming the PH balance was just fine.  I paid out of pocket for the fresh batch to be mixed and it was just as I suspected---my son was 100% better.  He needed his medicine to be compounded fresh to be effective.\\n\\nI thought everything was fine, since she had agreed to comound it fresh. Until I needed it filled again.  This time she said no. (?!) I begged them to compound it for me fresh and after going back and forth she agreed but to come back in a few days (so two days of severe pain for my son).  \\n\\nThe next time I called to have it refilled, she said no again.  I brought in my son so she could see this is a 5 month old BABY we are talking about.  She seemed to enjoy holding the power in her hands to make the decision to compound the medicine fresh.  She insisted she couldn't, that she  had to move the product on the shelf before mixing a new batch.  When I reminded her that she had done it before, she said this time she couldn't.  Never mind that my son was in severe pain and all it took to make a baby feel better was to compound the medicine for him fresh.  She told me it could possibly be me nursing him (I don't feel like it was her business or right to give me advice on that--but when I told her I already switched him to a sensitive formula, she then said perhaps I should seek alternative medicine.   I don't understand why she thought it necessary to give me medical advice when we already see a pediatrician and a pediatric gi for my son's condition--all we needed was his medicine compounded when I needed a refill).\\n\\nReluctantly, she agreed to fill it if I came back again the next day.  \\n\\nI thought we finally ended the drama and she'd be willing to do this for my baby.\\n\\nUntil the next refill.  This time when I called the person who answered the phone said the pharmacist said no.  Sigh. Again.  I begged.  I pleaded.  She checked again with the pharmacist and she came back with this response: \\"She said she'd mix it fresh for you but you'll have to pay extra\\".  WHAT?!?!?!?!  \\n\\nI couldn't believe my ears.  Pay extra? To refill a medicine that I was already having to pay out of pocket for because of the frequent refills?  I've never heard of a pharmacist demanding extra money to refill a prescription.  Was she going to pocket it? It felt like extortion.  She knew I needed this medicine desperately and was willing to pay anything.    I've never ever seen such an ego in one person.  Apparently the power of mixing medicine that a little baby is in need of went to her head.  So sad.  \\n\\nTo the pharmacist who made my life miserable and my baby suffer: \\"When a medication is compounded, the PPI granules/beads are suspended in a buffer solution (generally a neutralizing bicarbonate) to help prevent stomach acid degradation. However, many pharmacies do not add enough buffer to protect the PPI. Furthermore, the medications do not handle being in such an altered state and can degrade much more quickly. The active ingredient then becomes inactive and ineffective in a short time period than the dispensed thirty day bottle (typically 5-7 days according to studies done by the Midwest Acid Reflux Children's Institution). Our suggestion is to find a pharmacy that specializes in compounding custom medications and have them fill the script for you.\\"  I know you think you know everything.  But sometimes, just sometimes, you need to listen to your customers and have a heart for the baby you are supposed to be helping, not hurting.\\n\\nPeople's pharmacy stopped getting my business that day."},{"name":"Dexter's Windermere","address":"4757 The Grove Dr, Ste 100","city":"Windermere","stars":"3","text":"After sitting and having a few drinks for at least an hour, the GM Ryan asked us to move from our bar table because of a 'reservation' (can you even reserve the self seating bar area?) he did offer a round of drinks on him but when we were seated at a table on the other side of the building he took our orders -left us waiting maybe 20 minutes before we had to waive someone else over just to reorder our drinks.

I thought that was more than fair, and the pieces of cake by the slice were $2.75. This place does take credit cards, BUT they have a $15 minimum, so if you're just looking to grab a quick treat to go, make sure you have some cash.\\n\\nI ended up eating the tiramisu right away, and it was delicious and extremely light, so I really didn't feel that bad after eating a slice. The coffee flavor could have been a bit stronger for my liking, but it was still good.\\n\\nThe strawberry cake is really everything it's chalked up to be. The strawberries taste super fresh, the cake itself is as light as anything, and the frosting is nice and creamy without the gross after taste you might get with some grocery store brands. I'd love to have more strawberries in the filling, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cake. \\n\\nI ended up eating the custard bun later in the week. It's prepackaged, so you can keep it for a bit in the fridge. Based on the lady's suggestion, I heated it up in the microwave for 15 seconds.

Quite a nice location, however it is all outside. On rainy days you might as well count it out (unless you don't mind the rain). There was plenty of large picnic sized tables to accommodate a good bit of people...hopefully you're lucky and get a spot in the shade on hot days like today. \\n\\nOk so now on to the good stuff! The BBQ!! We tried the brisket, turkey, sausage, ribs, and beef rib (yeah, we went a little crazy lol). All of it was melt in your mouth delicious! Seriously! The rub on the brisket was divine. The flavor of the ribs were good too. Turkey and sausage both delicious. The star of the show? The beef rib... O M G! Talk about melt in your mouth delicious! \\n\\nIn all I am so happy we decided to come here. We didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn to sit in a line for hours to enjoy this amazing food. We will definitely be back on our next trip!"},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The food is fantastic, the staff is wonderful, but the decor is slightly below standard--it is a little grungy even by hipster standards, but don't let that deter you if you like pancakes.  The pulled pork pancakes are nothing short of heavenly.  The cakes are the perfect consistency and big enough to satisfy a mid-day brunch appetite.  Adding pork to the already tasty flapjacks, delivers a needed dose of protein to the meal and renders enough calories for an entire day.  Adding maple syrup creates the perfect savory, salty, sweet balance that is irresistible.

The consensus was \\"too small, no flavor, cold, took too long,\\" but I had to know for myself. I used one of the free coupons and, lo and behold, flat cold pizza. I hate to side with people from Chicago about pizza but all the guests were right - it didn't taste like anything and there was hardly a serving for an actual person with the small pie. I checked the actual prices and the only way you could eat a normal amount of pizza would be to buy their biggest pie and, even then, you'd be eating Red Brick Pizza. Why would you do that?

However, when we arrived, the hostess did not have the correct number of people in our reservation written accurately and took the table they had originally set for 10 and added 2 extra chairs at the small end of the table. I had to speak with 4 people before someone was finally willing to add another table on! The restaurant was not busy, and there were plenty of extra tables, but no one seemed to understand what I was asking.\\n\\nOnce that situation was settled, we started by ordering a round of drinks. I went with the server's recommendation of Shut the Front Door. This $13 cocktail was supposed to be blueberry infused vodka with elderflower and lemonade. If I had to take a guess, I paid $13 for a glass of lemonade with a splash of vodka and heck of a lot of ice.\\n\\nWe ordered appetizers to be shared by the table and went with the Fried Green Tomatoes ($12), the Sticky Honey Soy Chicken Wings ($12), and the Showtime Nachos ($15). In my opinion, they were all overpriced for what we received. The nachos were fine, your typical corn chips with melted cheese, some pickled onions, sour cream, a bit of guacamole and some salsa. The fried green tomatoes were decent but I've definitely had better. These were a bit mushy and soggy. The wings were a hit with the table, so I'd suggest going for those if you were interested.\\n\\nThe menu didn't contain anything overly special or exciting. There are sandwiches, pizzas and entrees, but nothing out of the ordinary. I went with the server's recommendation for the Grilled Chicken Breast Focaccia. I was excited for it, as it was focaccia bread with grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, portobello mushrooms, artichoke pesto and basil leaves. It looked good when it arrived, although unfortunately the kitchen wasn't able to time having all of our entrees ready at the same time, and one person's pizza and another's burger was served about 5 min after all our food was brought out. As its customary to wait until all are served to eat, I did so, and this resulted in my sandwich becoming extremely soggy and cold- to the point where I had to pick my sandwich apart and could not eat the bread. Despite being cold, the flavor of the chicken and mushrooms were good. I'm sure it would have been much more enjoyable if I could have enjoyed it warm."},{"name":"Al Wadi","address":"1249 Vfw Pkwy","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"Wandered into this place after having purchased a $24 voucher off Bloomspot. I assumed this was a small-med sized \\"gyro to go\\" kind of place with a few tables if you chose to dine in but I was totally wrong. This is a free-standing full sized (including full bar) restaurant that features a pretty pricey menu. $24 essentially covered one person's meal...! \\n\\nI came with my boyfriend and brother, they shared the mixed grill for two and I got the baked haddock. The fish was rather dry (nothing special) but at least for $18 they gave you two big fish fillets on a bed of \\"spiced rice\\". They topped it with caramelized onions and pine nuts (yummy) and there was a white sauce on the side. The shared mixed grill ($45) definitely was more than enough for two grown men, we all took leftovers home. \\n\\nThe food here wasn't exactly phenomenal or very unique. The vinaigrette used on the salad was a little too sour for me and so were the stuffed grape leaves. The hummus was good and the baba ghanoush was up to par.\\n\\nI liked our waiter but hated the slow service. When we first got seated we probably waited a solid 15 minutes before anyone even GREETED us and brought water. Then it also took a hot minute for them to bring out 4 dates ($6 or something like that) so my bf could break his fast. Food was slow to come out and getting the check/paying prob took a half hour (no joke). \\n\\nAt the end of our meal we shared a big slab of chocolate cake along with a chai tea. The cake was light, not overbearingly sweet but was very salty???  ($8 piece of cake)\\n\\nLong story short, portions were fair for the prices they charged but it didn't help that the food wasn't rave-worthy.

They have a little bakery type section (grains are a no-no for me, so I moved on, even though it looked quite tempting), then a whole slew of prepared foods. You could get a wrap, some chicken or tuna salad, etc, and you could also order a ton of things directly from the counter, like smoothies. I picked out a gorgeous chicken-salad stuffed tomato. Of course it was marked up with stickers like Farmer's Market, Pastured eggs, and Local to denote the freshness of the veggies, egg, and meat. \\n\\nWOW. I have never eaten a pastured egg cuz they are like 5.99 a dozen. (Pastured is different than \\"cage free \\"or \\"organic\\" if ya care, worth looking up if you are a health nut like myself). Now I know why they cost so much - because they are friggin DELICIOUS. I only got one measly hard boiled egg and this thing had so much flavor...amazing. Most hard boiled eggs are just a rubbery blob you gotta salt up or mix with mayo, etc to make tasty.

I would favor to say close to an hour's time.\\n\\nSo I was expecting something absolutely fantastic and mind-blowing, since the general consensus suggested the burgers would be pretty rad. I was kind of disappointed. I got the Groundhog burger for $10. It included mushrooms, bacon, grilled onions, and cheese. I actually didn't realize until checking out the menu that they even included grilled onions. Whoops. The burger itself was okay. The bacon taste was VERY minimal, the onion taste nonexistent. There was a decent amount of swiss and mushroom, but it was just an okay burger. There's a place in Atlanta called Farmburger where you can get a MUCH better tasting burger for $8 cooked to however you want it done. My friend got the Freebird, I want to say. It had chicken on it. I tasted that, and it was MUCH better than the burger I got.

It looked like it's a standard medium, when I prefer medium rare.\\nIt's basically seat yourself, so service is nonexistent. \\n\\nTHE VERDICT\\nI don't think waiting close to an hour was worth the food that I tasted.  And the thing is... I was STARVING. I hadn't eaten since 10am, and I'd been walking around for close to 6 hours without eating anything else. I should have been so hungry that anything I put in my mouth (phrasing) would have tasted heavenly, regardless of where I ended up getting it. But that just wasn't the case.

Low lit lights around the place create that type of ambiance. Bar top seating, high top tables, booth benches and table seating makes for a very accommodating place.

What kind of turned me off was when it hit around 11:30pm. They started rushing people out and took away some of the things off our tables prematurely. It was almost like they were really trying to send a message to us. That was kind of weird and kind of annoying. Aside from that, here's what I got:\\n\\nRapido Pinot Grigio for $8 a glass. It was a nice pour. The pinot grigio was a bit too dry than what I was used to, or preferred. A little on the tart side, you could still taste a lemon citrus flavor which was nice.\\n\\nTen Span Pinot Noir for $13. From white to red, I wanted to try a full bodied vino and I'm glad I went with this one! The wine seemed to linger on my palate and was the sign of a great choice. It had a nice berry flavor.

Definitely made some yum noises at the table haha. Our server told us that he knew someone who broke their 9 years of vegetarianism for that dish and I believe it! Ambiance was really nice outside and looked to be great inside as well. Got to ride a nice elevator up which was great, and parking was validated.

Since the grilled kabobs are $1 a piece (except for the ox penis, those are $5 each.. for good reason, I suppose), I would recommend the lamb kabobs as being the most worthy of your money. And make sure to eat them right when they come out because the gamey texture blended with the cumin spices will undoubtedly taste the best when the kabobs are hot. \\n\\nThe lamb noodle soup is another personal favorite, mainly because it's so simple yet wonderfully comforting.

If you love wine, you will love what Tastings can offer. However, the service leaves a lot to be desired. \\n\\nWe came on a rainy Friday evening around 5pm, and it was packed largely because all of their tables in the back had been reserved. We weren't really sure what we were supposed to do, so we waited at the host stand for a few minutes until someone came up to us and told us we would need to find seats at the bar or one of four high top tables, each with 2 chairs. There were two seats at the bar, so we sat there, but several servers came behind the bar, saw us, but said nothing. Finally, a group left one of the tables, so we took that, and it was another 10 minutes before someone came to serve us. All in all, it took 16 minutes for someone to come serve us - I know because the new parking in the Short North is done via an app on my phone that has a timer. When our server did come, he seemed annoyed by our presence (it was weird) and did not really offer a good explanation of how the tasting worked, other than that you put money on the cards. It would have helped to have him say \\"most people put X amount on it\\" or \\"the smallest pours range from $3-$6\\", or something like that, because we had no idea what we were doing. Our server also acted like we were a huge inconvenience, which came out of nowhere and didn't help us feel welcome.\\n\\nI definitely recommend doing the prepaid card so you can walk around and decide what to try - it is really fun and different to do the self-pouring machines after reading about the wines. They have a great variety of options with good descriptions. We each put $15 on our cards, which was enough for about 4 of the smallest tastings. You can reload them if you want. We also ordered a cheese plate with two cheeses, which was a good thing to snack on while tasting but nothing special. \\n\\nOverall, I would love to give this place a higher rating because the wine tasting is really fun, and it is a really unique approach. I was originally going to give it 4 stars, but after thinking about it for a few days, the poor service is the main thing that stands out to me, so I have to give it 3."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - I-Drive","address":"8148 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Used to love Kobe's, but they have done me real dirty my last two visits.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing though, especially because they serve breakfast all day. Who doesn't want breakfast at 9pm?! One of my good friends recommended this place because she knew I was vegetarian and would have more options than ever. She ordered a bowl of matcha tea (yes it really is in a bowl, or rather a teacup without a handle), and we split a fried avocado to start. I didn't think I could love avocados any more but turns out if you fry it I can. She ordered the southern eggs benedict which was served on these delicious pepper biscuits. I ended up ordered the Club sandwich with cheddar cheese added because it's basically a rule of mine to never eat a sandwich without cheese on it, unless it's a PB&J I guess. My sandwich was so full of flavor which is usually lacking in some vegan sandwiches. Just because I'm vegetarian doesn't mean I want everything to taste like cardboard or lettuce. Give me the melty flavorful greasy goodness.That fake bacon will be in my dreams tonight I'm sure of it, along with the garlic mayo and their potato salad. All the servers were super friendly, patient, and accommodating. I loved the diner feel of it and was so sad I filled up too much to try one of their vegan shakes. All the more reason to return!

Not because I particularly like Bibibop, but because this area needs more food options, and when I fill up at Costco I have been watching the \\"coming soon!\\" signs for months.  It finally opened last week, but I couldn't get in because of my work schedule.   \\n\\nI dropped in yesterday, starving and ready to give them another chance (I've eaten at another location, and wasn't particularly impressed.)  I love Korean food.  Love, love.  And this ain't it.  The name implies it, but really it is more of an Asian fusion Chipotle.  Which is fine, for what it is.  I mean, I love authentic Mexican but still go to Chipotle if I'm in a hurry, or even occasionally Taco Bell.  They aren't Mexican, but they're good at what they do.  Bibibop is good at what they do, I'm just not that into it.\\n\\nThe place is smaller than you might think, and was crowded at 2pm on a weekday with hipsters, teenagers, and soccer moms.  Service was super fast though (not real friendly, but I guess they were rushed.)  Pick a protein, a base, veggies, and sauce.  I felt rushed and wasn't sure what some of the stuff was, but I picked interesting things and froze at the sauces.  Unsure, I picked yum yum.  There is a sauce bar on the side so you can add your own.  Anyway, I got noodles, spicy chicken, assorted veggies.  Add a side of kimchee and a drink, and it was barely $10.  Which is cool, till you realize you're hungry and the portions are not all that big.  Maybe they need to have two bowl sizes?  Still, it's a decent amount, so if you don't come in famished you'll be fine.\\n\\nThe chicken was actually slightly spicy.  The kimchee, not really, but it tasted fine.  The noodles were pretty generic, the veggies were fresh, the whole thing blended pretty well.  You can get free miso soup, which was decent.  The whole experience, from counter to tall tables to stand-up bar, was geared toward fast eating.  There's a place for that, and I'll be back when I need a light lunch in a hurry.

The food was four(ish) stars. The waiter was maybe three stars. But the host. The. Host.\\n\\nSo at first I walk up to the door, and I see a man standing in the door. Thinking he is coming out, maybe waiting for a friend to put on a coat, I stand away from the door for a minute and look over the outside menu. The menu is pricey.. but I'm on a business trip and I haven't eaten anything today, so let's just spend my per diem on a nice warm bowl of pasta. And it had great reviews on yelp. And it was close to my hotel. And it was 16 fucking degrees outside.\\n\\nI walk back to the door and this man hasn't moved. So I gently knock to let him know I want to come in. Nothing. No movement. So I knock harder. Nothing. So I just open the door. He doesn't say anything to me at all... no hello, no good evening, no table for one... just stares at me. \\n\\nI'm like \\"uhh, are you open tonight?\\" (It looks pretty empty inside).\\n\\nHe's like \\"Uh, yes. Have you looked at the menu?\\" And I tell him yes. \\n\\nHe looks skeptically at me and says, \\"would you like to look at it again?\\" \\n\\nAt this point I'm feeling kind of offended... but to give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe they had a special menu tonight or they change it up on Mondays or whatever. Nope. Same menu.\\n\\nSo I look up at him like... \\"yes, same menu... thanks.\\"\\n\\nHim: \\"So you want a table? Just one then?\\"\\n\\nMe: \\"... yes.\\"\\n\\nTo cover up the obvious discomfort he tells me that... \\"you know a lot of people come in here wanting things like chicken parmesan... because this isn't like other restaurants in the neighborhood... blah blah. Just need to make sure you actually want this kind of food.\\"\\n\\nDo I look illiterate? Do I look like someone who needs to read a menu twice to understand what kind of food I want?\\n\\nAs I am then seated at my table, my waiter giggles at me slightly.\\n\\nI sit there for a LONG time waiting for him to come back to my table to get my order. Like a ridiculously long time for how dead it is. I finally have to usher him back with overwhelming eye contact. \\n\\nHe was mostly ok the rest of the meal, but I never really got over my initial encounter with the host (and yes, I did tip well despite everything).\\n\\nYou'd think, with only two other tables occupied in this place, that they would be happy for an extra customer. You'd also probably assume that they didn't ask the three older couples next to me if they had looked at the menu. The realization of this really sunk in, as my mediocre lobster pasta sunk in... deeper, deeper, until I finished every last bite. The nice gentleman who was helping my waiter clear plates was the only thing keeping me from leaving a nasty note, to be totally honest.\\n\\nAs I spent a fair amount of time snap chatting this story to some friends, I decided justice should be served. Maybe this man didn't mean his offense, but he should know that what he did was at best rude, and worst, pretty sexist and dismissive.\\n\\nSo as I walked out, I approached him with my concern. \\n\\n\\"It must be exhausting asking every table if they've looked at the menu before they are seated, huh?\\"\\n\\nSo instead of apologizing for his behavior, or maybe even for the misunderstanding, he simply says that soooo many people come in expecting cheap Italian food and get water and bread and then leave and are soon disappointed.

The rice was cooked ahead of time and I'm guessing stored (frozen?) in saran wrap, and then microwaved. It was like a stiff rubber puck sitting on a plate.

My companion got pad thai. *Inedible*. It looked okay, but something in it was badly burned. You could smell it even a chair away. It was returned and they brought out a new one.

The thing that was disconcerting was that they didn't seem to care what the problem was.

The rumor was that one of the chefs from Starliner Diner had defected to create his own eatery.  Being a long-time fan of Starliner, I had to check it out.\\n\\nFive of us set sail down to Hilliard.  LouiE's (note the capital E), has a nice location across from the Clean-A-Car car wash on Cemetery Road.  This puts it in easy distance from I-270 and old Hilliard both.\\n\\nLouiE's is located in a strip mall, but has frontage, which will definitely help here.  It isn't hidden like Starliner.\\n\\nWalking in, I was struck by how different it was from Starliner.  The restaurant still had an eclectic feel to it, but the Spanish influence was stronger, and the furniture less torn.\\n\\nThe first thing that struck me was Chicken Mofongo on the specials board.  One of the fan favorites from Starliner was already up and available.  I also noticed a \\"Pasta Special\\" that looked surprisingly like Creole Macaroni (yet another fave from the Starliner).\\n\\nBeing torn between the two, I negotiated a split with RolandK3.  He would order the \\"dish not to be named Creole Mac\\" and I would get the Mofongo.  The majority of the rest of the table went with the Mofongo.\\n\\nThe Creole Ma-- Pasta Special was in the same family as Creole Mac, but nicely different.  Though it could have used a little more kick, the addition of grilled red peppers and cauliflower were a surprise, but welcome.  The chunks of sausage were a bit smaller and sparser than what you might find in Creole Mac, but the addition of some shrimps to the dish made it tasty.\\n\\nCajun Pasta Special:  Macaroni noodles, cauliflower, chicken, sausage, and shrimp, with sweet corn, thin carrot slices and roasted red peppers in a creamy creole sauce.  Definitely yummy\\n\\nThe Mofongo was very similar to what I've had in the past:  a chicken breast pounded flat, wrapped around chorizo and fried plantains, then breaded and cooked.  The whole thing is topped with a red sauce and sidled with black beans and rice.\\n\\nI have to give this one two thumbs up.  Though the chicken could have been a bit more pounded to my taste, but the flavors were fantastic.  I had expected the rice and beans to simply be a starch filler, but I was pleasantly surprised to find them to be flavorful enough to be a main dish.  They are seasoning the rice more than they did at Starliner, and it is a welcome change.\\n\\nPortions are hearty, and prices are decent.  For an entree and soft drink, we came out of there at about $14 including tip.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend trying this place out.

I decided to go for my fave gnocchi and the wife went for the hanger steak.  The gnocchi were individually fairly large, but the serving was a bit small.  I had avoided the ravioli for the fear of too small of a serving and I still ended up with a small serving. The sauce was decent with meaty slices of mushrooms scattered about to give the pillowy gnocchi some interest.  The wife's steak was cooked as requested on the rare side of medium rare and still had a nice char on the outside.  Although good and fairly tender, the steak needed more flavor, which the spinach and singular strip of red pepper didn't help out much with.  I feel like we may have been better off ordering a handful of the first courses than diving into the mains.\\n\\nThrough all this, we went through a few 100 ml taste glasses each without really coming across anything we particularly liked.  Our waiter, seemingly very knowledgeable about wine, wasn't all that helpful in making any suggestions when we made some requests of what we typically like.

They are absolutely phenomenal in terms of taste, location, and price. However, this newer Rod Dee, closer to Washington Square, although possessing good qualities, is nothing in comparison to the original. I love Rod Dee; I've never once had a bad experience and after I eat it, I'm stuffed for hours, but because my expectations of it are so high, based on the other Rod Dee, this one is great, but not spectacular. \\n\\nI mean, don't get me wrong. Rod Dee is my all time favorite place to get Thai food, regardless of which location we're speaking of. Their food is cooked just how I like it and if I ask for any special changes, they happily do it and never grumble about it in front of me. Their portions are great and can last for two meals, but being the eater I am, I usually make it one.\\n\\nThe one thing that gives this place it's fourth star is this one rice plate they have. I don't quite remember what it's called, but it's on that specials board they've got behind them. It's a huge pile of rice topped with sliced sausages, melt-in-your-mouth roasted pork, and deep-fried, crispy pork belly. Dressed in a sweet, barbecue sauce and garnished with a bit of torn cilantro and two cucumber slices, it is absolutely amazing. I always drown it out with a ton of hot sauce, but it's great as is. It could easily be separated into two meals, but I can't quite get myself to do that yet.\\n\\nI'd say I normally like noodles better than rice, which is blasphemy coming from an Asian such as myself, but I can't help it. However, this one rice plate knocks the socks off any noodle dish I've ever had. Now, I might just be exaggerating, but that's just to further enhance how strongly I feel about this particular rice dish.\\n\\nAnyhow, all in all, Rod Dee is my most favorite Thai place to go to.

The food was good, but in South Africa you do not serve portions of food that may satisfy a rabbit's appetite with prices that do not even come close to any sort of value for money. I understand Americans or other non-South Africans may find YEBO a neat place to try different cuisine, but you are better off looking up a South African recipe and cooking it yourself for a 1/3rd of the price. Feel free to reach out to me, and I would be more than happy to provide some great recipes. \\n\\nExample - Lollipop Lamb $15 = two really small lamb chops with a little bit of quinoa\\n\\nYou get more bone than meat. I am a patriotic South African, and I try to promote anything South African as much as I can so it kills me to write a negative review about Yebo, but I do not want people to think YEBO is a typical South African dining experience. There are plenty of places in Atlanta where you will get a similar dining experience at half the price. Do not come here and have the same experience as I had and feel ripped off and hungry.

Now I do have to mention this is somewhat biased because we are from the philadelphia region and we know what a real cheese steak is and have been disappointed so many times when it comes to ordering something called a PHILADELPHIA CHEESESTEAK.\\n\\nSo I ordered the philadelphia loaded cheesesteak.  (I run a gourmet hot dog stand and I know us restaurant owners have to stick together, but I;m sorry G, I have to be honest at the same time I can not lie.)  Now let's start with appearance:  It was not loaded when compared to what I think of loaded, I am thinking that loaded means the bun is so filled that stuff is falling off of the bun, this was not the case.  Come to find out loaded just meant they added the onions, mushrooms and green peppers, so I will give them that because that is what most places consider loaded, which is extra items placed on an item that don't normally come with it.  Almos like you can get a baked potato at places or you can get it loaded which means bacon, cheese and sour cream added.\\n\\nThe bun was definitely too big for the amount of steak, onions, mushrooms and green peppers take up.  I think it would of been better if they were to use like a 6 inch bun instead.  The steak seemed to be the same steak that other places use for making a cheese steak.  I don't know why no one buys a RIBEYE, cut it fresh and make it that way, especially if they want to call it a phiily cheese steak.\\n\\nOver all the Loaded Philly cheese steak is at the top of my list for philly cheese steaks compared to other places that I have tried around the Columbus, Ohio area.  I have to give a shout out to Mr. Hero located at 2087 E Livingston Ave.  They are #1 on my list for a cheese steak.\\n\\nThe taste and the freshness of the bun that they made it on was good, I have no complaints with how it was cooked by no means, but I think it should be just called a Loaded Cheese Steak and not a Loaded Philly Cheese Steak.\\n\\nBeing I am in the restaurant industry, I do think the pricing was fair for what you get.  As I understand the overhead, food costs and all the other factors that you have to take into consideration when pricing an item.\\n\\nSo thank you for a very pleasurable experience, and I would definitely go back.  However I would definitely go back and definitely try something else on the menu.\\n\\nThank You G and to your staff,\\nShawn Mulligan"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 1208","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic burgers.

My girlfriend and I started off with the table-side guacamole, which was both delicious and fun to watch made right in front of us. It's also nice because you can tell the server whether or not you want certain ingredients added to it (my girlfriend doesn't like cilantro).\\n\\nThe entrees we ordered were the shrimp tamales (for me) and the chiles rellenos (for my girlfriend). They were both quite good, but beware that there's some spice to it. My girlfriend doesn't like spicy foods, but I think these rellenos might have made a convert out of her! Also, note that the table gets a bowl of beans and a bowl of rice that are shared. The rice was a little dry, but the beans were quite good.\\n\\nFor dessert we got the got the coconut flan.

Hands down, La Barbecue was the best that we tried. Because of the popularity of the restaurant and long lines that come with it, we pre-ordered our meals via email (5 day notice required) and went straight to La Barbecue once our flight landed in Austin. Sure enough, we were greeted with a long line of patrons. For pre-orders, go around to the back window for pick up. Once you provide your name, they cut up and weigh your meat orders. Perfect first meal in Austin...\\n\\nBrisket ($20.00 per pound):\\nThe brisket by far was my husband and I's favorite part of our order.

The flavor of the pulled pork here was a good balance of sweet and salty. It was smothered in a super tasty sauce, which I wish they sold \\n\\nChipotle Sausage ($4.50 per link):\\nPretty large in size and definitely worth the $4.50. The sausage had a nice kick to it. Not that spicy, but enough of a flavor to notice \\n\\nSliced Brisket Sandwich ($10.00):\\nThis sandwich has pickles and onions and is served on a potato bun. Personally, I enjoyed the brisket on its own. Even though I removed two or three pieces to eat by itself, my husband was still left with a good sized portion of the sandwich \\n\\nMy husband and I returned to La Barbecue (after trying other spots) hoping to purchase their dry rub and/or sauce.

I was very fortunate to be invited to attend and critically sample a few of the miniature sliders. Leaving the event very full but happy, I made a mental note to return for the public opening on January 23rd which happens to be today!\\n\\nNot knowing how many people would be coming, I showed up about 10 minutes before the restaurant was set to open. Amusingly, just as I walked through the entrance doors, Chef Connor Butler lifted a strong arm in greeting and bellowed \\"HEY MAN!\\" loudly. I was a little taken aback at first but the boisterous greeting really set the tone for the rest of my meal.\\n\\nAs today was opening day, the waitresses instructed everyone to find their own seat and await table service. I am pretty sure going forward, patrons will walk up to the cashier to order and pay together but I guess today was meant to be special. I sat down, was immediately given ice water w/ lemon and asked what I wanted. The waitress was very friendly and took my standard order of a Max's Burger and Strawberry Milkshake then left.\\n\\nSpeaking once again to Chef Butler's friendly personality, when the first Max's Burger order was served to the jolly gentleman above, Chef came out to personally greet the man and take a photo with his cellphone. I was sitting right next to the gentleman so found it pretty amusing. I won't digress but the commemorative photo above is of Mr. Steve Burnfield, a member of CASI or the Chili Appreciation Society International. We ended up chatting quite a bit through lunch and proved foodies are all united through our mutual love of all things epicurean.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the food. As I mentioned earlier, although there are many fantastic burger selections to choose from, I decided to go with the standard offering of \\"The Big Max $9\\" as I wanted to critically examine what will undoubtedly become the most ordered burger amongst the public. On my second, third etc. visits, I will definitely get more adventurous with offerings like the 'British Columbian' and the 'Crab Po'Boy.'\\n\\nIn about 10-12 minutes, my burger and fries arrived with my Strawberry Milkshake following a few minutes later. As you can read in the menu photo above, the Big Max burger is 5 ounces of Max's specially seasoned, special recipe, fresh, never frozen, griddled Alberta chuck on their house baked brioche bun. Served with shredded iceberg lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, mustard and hand cut Kennebec fries, the initial aroma was spectacularly enticing. (Max's also notes they use healthy, natural tallow in their fryers) Whew, so all those fancy words aside, what is the final verdict? In one word? Delicious. Looking at the photo below, you can definitely tell the burger is of a much higher quality than any \\"fast-food\\" offering in the city. The bun is fresh, soft and crisp. The shredded lettuce and tomato were very fresh and gave the burger that nice refreshing crunch. What was most noticeable about the burger as a whole was the lack of excessive condiment use you sometimes find at other establishments. This allows you to really savor the taste of the patty which is complimented, not upstaged, by the other ingredients. At a good enough size to sit comfortably in both of my hands, the burger was the perfect size for me, leaving me content but not overly full. The light salted Kennebec fries were crisp on the outside but warm and mealy on the inside which is just how fries should be.\\n\\nA quick mention about the milkshake, it was good! Although many customers will simply drink the free ice water or spend a couple dollars on a coke/sprite, the $5 milkshake was cold, very thick and extremely flavorful. I could literally taste the fresh strawberries in every exaggerated pull I took from the straw. With the included spoon, I even finished the delicious pillow-y fresh whipped cream with cherry.\\n\\nWrapping up this quick review, Max's Burgers gave a strong performance on its opening day and I will definitely be back. At a relatively fair price point that is competitive with pretty much any premiere burger joint in the city, Max's Burgers seeks to distinguish themselves with local ingredients and novel burger concepts. In my opinion, they have done quite well so far. If you have a free lunch break in any of the upcoming days/weeks, definitely swing by Max's and see if Chef Butler and his team can satisfy your burger hankering."},{"name":"Swiss Bakery","address":"143 3rd Avenue E","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great Frissants but don't order the Maple Bacon Donuts. \\n\\nHazelnut Frissant has a nice balance of sweetness, crispy, creaminess and not oily at all.

Not to mention, many veggie restaurants cut down the quality or quantity of their ingredients to keep the prices reasonable.\\n\\nWhen Veggie Galaxy opened, I checked out the menu but wasn't in a rush to go. They had a number of dishes that could go either way. Pancakes or French toast can be dry; the portions of delicious-sounding toppings can be meager (see my review for Renee's Cafe, where when your French toast comes with cranberries you might get 3 dried cranberries lovingly placed atop your toast). Sandwiches can be too dry or too greasy, but it's so hard to hit that \\"juuuuust right\\" note in true Goldilocks style.\\n\\nWell, Veggie Galaxy was spot on.

My friend had the \\"Cambridge Street\\" omelette (with chipotle black beans, roasted red pepper puree, Vermont jack cheese, sweet corn, shallot, and and apple salsa); the ratio of all those ingredients to the eggs was great, and they didn't jack up the omelette price ($8.95) because of it.\\n\\nCute interior in the style of a 1950s diner.

I was concerned that I wouldn't get a table, since well, NO ONE was approaching us or even acknowledging our presence to begin with, and I saw at least 2 of their employees walk by us.

The crowd was full of people in their 20s (and the occasional folks who are 50+) in their Canucks swag. Mostly groups of four and up, but there were certainly tables of twosomes.\\n\\nFood: I had the Ceilis classic burger, which was beefed up with meat. The bun was glazed with some spicy sauce, and it was a sizable burger. Very average though. Fries however, was below average. It was served cold already, so imagine picking at it for 30 minutes. Winter fries, much?\\n\\nThey have a wide selection of beer, and I went on a special night where Sleeman Honey  Browns were $5.50.

We took it upon ourselves to ask the waitress if we could sit down - which eventually we did. \\n\\nAfter sitting, we talked and waited...and continued to wait as no waiter/waitress or anyone came to check on us. Eventually, after 15 minutes my older mother took it upon herself to walk to the back and ask if someone could help us. \\n\\nWe then were approached by \\"the manager\\" who asked \\"what we needed\\". I was caught off guard and promptly asked for a glass of red wine. The manager then asked for my ID (I am a 32 year old male). I handed him my out of state license, which he told me he could not accept as \\"proper identification\\". He asked if I had any other \\"proper identification\\". All I had was credit cards so therefore he could not serve me wine. I was dumbfounded as I've dined recently in many Arlington/Medford establishments and never had an ID issue. \\n\\nRegardless, I do understand that different places have different rules but it was what followed that really bothered me.\\n\\nAs my mother received her glass of wine, she asked \\"the manager\\" why my ID could not be accepted. He again reiterated that my license was not \\"proper identification\\" and further elaborated by saying that every states license requires \\"holograms on their licenses\\". OBVIOUSLY, that is not true...as my out of state license clearly did not have a hologram...so I don't appreciate the manager making up this \\"so called rule\\". \\n\\nAfter this exchange, my mother and I continued to talk...and yet again we waited, another 10 minutes as no one took our order. Finally, yet again, we asked the waitress if we could order. \\n\\nWhile the service was poor, the food was fine. Enjoyed the lasagna. \\n\\nAll in all just had a bad overall experience at Twyrl and really disappointing. For a cute, small place, that only seats 10 or so tables you would expect better service and a little better service from the manager (or even a check in from the owner - who we were told was there)."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome cocktails ... they don't skimp on the alcohol.

When we arrived for our reservation (about 10 mins late, I'll admit), the host admonished us and said we should have called if we knew we were running behind. There were a few empty tables in just the front room, so I thought that was kind of an odd comment, especially since I've always heard that if you're under 15 minutes late, your table will be held, no problem. So trying to move past that, they sit us at a booth. When I sit down, I am immediately splashed with water from the seat next to me in the booth, where apparently the A/C vent has been leaking for hours, or at least long enough to leave a puddle that got my skirt and bag pretty dang wet. So they move us and the same host makes a comment under his breath to our server that if we'd arrived on time, we would not have been sat at that table. Rude! After that whole ordeal, we finally get to order food and things went much more smoothly. We got the duck fat fries for an appetizer and they were good, but not as dripping in duck fat as I've had other places. Then we waited about 30-40 mins for our entrees. I had the beef shoulder, my boyfriend got the pork butt and my friend got the vegetable antipasto. My boyfriend and I were both blown away by how good the meat was. Our meals were both so good, but if I had just had the meat, it would've been the same quality. My friend liked her veggies a lot, too!

The egg is hard boiled and you have to peel the shell off yourself.\\n\\nWhen my order arrived, I saw how large the \\"Peking Duck\\" wrap was and realized that it was probably the size of 2-3 regular pieces of Peking Duck. Their cr√™pe is filled with duck, crunchy cucumbers, green onions, and soybean paste and then folded in half and placed in a wax paper wrapper.

Sure enough, there was a mouse, right under the cake cabinet, sniffing around for scraps. It did not seem alarmed that there were people around, in fact, it looked very comfortable, like it knew the place. After a while, one of the girls working finally made her way over to the ordering station/bakery side, clearly irritated that there are still new patrons coming in when they don't close for another hour. I told her in a low voice that there was a mouse and she responded with \\"yeah, i know\\". That was it. No follow up response of how they plan to remedy this problem, or that it was a new issue. Nope, she knew there is a rodent problem and could not care less.\\nIf the food was good I would say that it's a shame I would never come back. However, nothing is good anymore. The coffee is ok, the pastries really just are terrible and expensive (who wants to pay $5 for a slab of creamed sugar?!), and on top of that there are mice crawling around the place, possibly nesting on utensils and plates, and countertops?

Shin Jung was exactly that. I spent last year in Seoul and frequently think of my home on the other side of the Earth. Shin Jung reminded me of it. The tasty samgyeopsal here reminded me of many nights spent having some late-night Korean BBQ with friends at Yonsei University in South Korea. I just happened to be wearing my Yonsei shirt the day I visited and the waitresses and I chatted about Korea and how different things are and how much fun it is there.\\n\\nKorean food is meant to be shared and most of the places in Tampa tend to cater towards individual orders, which just isn't the culture of Korea and honestly detracts from the experience. However, the grills at Shin Jung encourage sharing which I liked. We ordered the samgyeopsal and the bulgogi. The samgyeopsal comes pre-cut so no worries about cutting it too thick or too thin (how I frequently would mess up my order in Korea -_-). It is hard to create the same taste that samgyeopsal has in Korea because Korea hardly imports any meat from the United States (however this may change soon with the recent free trade agreement between S.K. and the U.S.A.), but Shin Jung certainly came close to it and I savored every last bite of my samgyeopsal. The bulgogi was great and tasted just like how it is in Korea. \\n\\nThere could be more ban-chan (side orders), but the amount is still pretty good for Florida and could be more or less of what you get in Korea depending on where you go (Southern Korea has 25+ ban-chan...it's amazing!). I loved the potato salad and the squid was amazing. The fermented soybean paste (doenjang) was also pretty good, though I was the only one of my friends interested in it since I am used to enjoying it everywhere in Korea. Kimchi was fresh and I definitely could have devoured a ton more. \\n\\nThey have Korean Hite beer which I love. It is similar to watered down Bud Light, but if you ever go to Korea you will drink Hite beer every night and frequently mix it with soju and learn to love it. Speaking of soju, I wish more places in Florida carried soju. Sake is everywhere, let's step up the soju exposure. I haven't seen any restaurant with soju in Florida thus far.\\n\\nI would definitely bring some friends as the portions are big enough and with some rice and ban-chan you can get full for around $50-$60 per table of 4.\\n\\nBest Korean place I have tried in Florida.

Even though the salad I had requested was not supposed to be there, I informed the reb from Grubhub to just keep it on and I would pay the difference. \\n\\n8:37pm, Seeing that my delivery time had passed, I called the store directly to find out what the status was of my order. It turns out that they never even started making any of my order !!! I was beyond pissed at this point !!! The store did not bother trying to call me directly to resolve the issue, and just let an hour pass before I would call to inquire about it. The employee who answered the phone did apologize, and explained he would rush the order, but still it would take around 20-30 minutes to complete. I told him at that point I didn't want it to be delivered, but I would just pick it up instead. \\n\\n9:10pm. After arriving at the store, I could see they were still in the process of preparing the order. While I was waiting, I did notice on their menu board that the flavored crust was supposed to be free, even though there was a charge of $.99 for it when I placed my order. Finally at 9:20pm, my order was ready. The employee did offer to refund my $2.50 that I paid for delivery, but at that point I really just wanted to go home to enjoy this meal after this nearly 2 hour journey. \\n\\nWhen I did get home, I was disappointed to find the meatballs that I had ordered were not in any of the boxes, and that they had left off the mushrooms on my pizza. The rest of the meal was correctly made though. \\n\\nThe sad part about this experience was that both me and my wife really enjoyed the meal. The pizza especially was flavorful and had an amazing crust to cheese ratio to it. The wings had a nice bite to them, and were not greasy at all. The only thing I didn't enjoy was that the chicken they use for the Alfredo was shredded instead of the strips that I normally see on this type of pasta. \\n\\nTo their credit, the restaurant did off me 20% off my bill the next day when I contacted Grubhub about the issues. While I would of liked to speak to the manager directly, both times it seems he was not in the restaurant. Maybe in a few months I might give this place a 2nd chance to see how it goes.

But next time, we'll skip the appetizers.\\n\\nWe ordered drinks and the toasted ravioli appetizer at the bar while we waited for our table. The tiny bar consists of 8 jammed-together seats that slope you backwards at a very awkward angle such that you have to strain to sit up and get your drink. Not feng shui. Not comfortable. Not even close.\\n\\nThe 8 small deep-fried, cheese-filled(?) ravioli came out on a bed of fried angel-hair wheat pasta and a small ramekin of what appeared to be marinara.  Nothing remotely interesting about these small hard bites. It felt like we were eating crispy-fried dough. I'd recommend skipping this.\\n\\nTable ready. Once seated, our very cordial wait-person briefed us on his specials, made a few recommendations, took our drink orders, and quickly had fresh hot bread in the table, all in short order, and showing a nice expedient professionalism. Nice save from the lousy ravioli.\\n\\nWe ordered house salads, the fresh fish special, and the New York strip. The salads were delicious. Fresh, crisp, loaded with various add-on's like tomatoes, onions, carrots - very well done. Fresh mahi, nicely grilled, with fresh asparagus spears. A nice-sized NY strip, grilled, with a nice char and medium-rare center. We split our meal so we could each enjoy surf-n-turf. And both is us agreed our meal was a hit. \\n\\nInterestingly, our server was probably the most memorable part of our evening. He had the intuitiveness to check in with us without disturbing us - he showed us both how an efficient, professional wait-person can add (or all-too-often detract) from a night out.

They offer different sizes of Fries and cajun if you like.  Usually a small will feed 2  people and if you come in toward the end of the night sometimes they will overload you with their fries which then you'd probably want a small and be able to feed like 3-4 people... It's best if you ate there because they tend to wrap everything in foil and that causes mushy burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches, however the hot dogs can withstand the wrapping a bit better.

We had reservations at 9:15, we came in and they sat us down right away.  For appetizers we ordered duck fat fries & the bacon & gruyere    bone marrow.  For the entrees we ordered crispy chicken thighs and the slow cooked beef shoulder, for sides we got crispy Brussel sprout leaves. \\n\\nDuck fat fries: my boyfriend and I love fries, it's practically his favorite food. Any fry is a good fry (except in n out burger) right? Ugh, I just don't get the egg on top. Imagine crispy wing stop fries without the seasoning, then plop a super wet runny flavorless egg on top? Why would you want your crispy fries getting soggy. And the sauce...? Lack luster to say the least. No flavor, it tasted like sweet mayo. Definitely wouldn't get again and definitely didn't get the hype. But for $8, it was a  good portion though guys!\\n\\nBacon gruyere bone marrow: I liked this dish, it was my first time trying \\"fancy\\" bone marrow at a restaurant. Who doesn't like bacon and cheese? This dish has more flavor and being able to scoop out the tiny bit of marrow was a fun experience. The parsley pur√©e on the side was boring, it tasted literally like parsley and oil that's it. Unnecessary since the marrow is already super oily and fatty. It would've been better if it had a slight acidity to it to cut the fattiness. It was a good first time and you should definitely try it for the experience, but I wouldn't get it twice. $17, mehhh.\\n\\nCrisp chicken thighs: this dish took forrrreeevverrr and a day to come out, so I had high hopes. When it came out I noticed it looked dry, like I didn't see any neck bone gravy on top on the side, on the table, under the table? Like I was searchinggg for it ok. I guess they forgot it. Y'all gave me some fried potatoes and 2 salt and peppered chicken thighs? No depth in flavor, no sauce no gravy, nothing at all special. For the price you're paying, trust me you can make this at home. Probably even better imo. Waste of $16.50.\\n\\nSlow cooked beef shoulder: like your typical slightly below average pot roast from Golden Corral lol. The Yukon mash was good, buttery and creamy. I wish it came with more! I literally got like 5 tiny pieces of \\"glazed root vegetables\\" in my pot. And why was fried egg needed? I guess to add extra creamy-ness?  The portion wasn't bad for $20, but it'll definitely be worth it if it was more flavorful and satisfying as it is a comforting type dish for some.\\n\\nCrispy Brussel sprout leaves: NOW THIS, THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY MEAL. I don't know what it was? Maybe the crisp tiny leaves, with the sweet golden raisins contrasting with the salty pecorino cheese? It was my favorite thing I had here, for $7 I wish the portion was bigger but I'd get this again and again it was that good. Get this.\\n \\nService: our server was ok, our appetizers came out in a timely manor, but we had to wait probably 30 minutes + for  our entrees and side. Not to mention the table who ordered after us got their food before us and we had a pretty similar order. But it's not her fault she can't control how fast the food is pushed out I guess.  We were pretty close to leaving but I asked her when the food was coming since we've been waiting for so long, she basically said \\"I mean your food is at the window, if you want to leave you can? I'm sorry about that.\\"But like in a I don't really care you've been waiting tone. This pretty much left a bad taste in my mouth on top of mediocre food that I just waited half an hour + to get. \\n\\nOver all, I really don't get the hype about this place or why it has such high ratings on yelp. If you go, 2 words... Brussel sprouts.\\n\\nOh and I only got 2 pictures, because the rest of my food took to long to come lol"},{"name":"Hollywood Casino Columbus","address":"200 Georgesville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Some friends and I have been talking about checking out the new Hollywood Casino for a number of weeks now; we finally made it over there last night.  We went around 6 p.m. and found the traffic pattern to be a little confusing when arriving.  Once we parked, we didn't quite know where the entrance was and ended up going into a side door. When entering, it was loud and bright - both were expected.  Now, of the 5 of us who went, we had all been to a casino before, but only 2 of the 5 of us were regular visitors of casinos. We walked around to get a feel for layout and there were slot machines galore!  The restaurants were spread out pretty nicely and they had a few sections of tables for play.  \\n\\nWe stuck to the slot machines and found all of us commented on how racists the slot machine names and graphics were.  After being there for a couple hours and continuously seeing said slot machines it was kind of getting to our friends who were of a different nationality. \\n\\nWe tried various slot machines and, to be honest, I had no clue how a few slot machines really worked - or when you won.  So, I held out until we tried the video poker.  They had a few video poker slot machines intermixed throughout the floor, but we found a handful of them that were $.25, perfect! Video poker it is!  I, personally, had a great time here, although I ended up losing a whole $2.00, I at least knew how to play and felt I had a little more say than just pushing a button and hope images line up.  After about an hour of video poker, we headed back to the penny slots.  I feel it's important to note that although they say they are penny slots, they really aren't... there are a number of them where the minimum bet is 30x or 150x; therefore they are more than a penny (technically).  I ended up losing a few extra dollars on these slots and feel they shouldn't be called penny slots if the minimum bet is $.30 or $1.50.  \\n\\nAfter staying for about 3 hours, we had enough.  A couple of us didn't even spend the amount we planned (a whole $20!) as we couldn't find slots (except the video poker) we cared to play.  Two people in our group broke even and one lost a little bit. \\n\\nI will agree with past reviewers - the casino was very clean (including the washrooms); they had free soda stations around the casino; I looked for the place to sign up for their rewards card and didn't see the stand/booth; and the decor was pretty nice - I liked the huge banners hanging from the ceiling of hollywood movies/stars.\\n\\nOverall, it was nice to try and visit, but it isn't a place I will be going back regularly.

I'm not a huge fan of the plastic covered part that keeps the cigarette smoke wafting in the air for longer than necessary, but otherwise i think I'll survive. The quirky thing about Marshall's is that it almost feels too classy for it's own good at times. They do have $1 drinks, which certainly prevents things from getting pretentious, but I often wonder what could have been going on here if it wasn't for the bar taking precedent over all other aspects of the business. And what's up with that koi pond, by the way? Not that I have any problem with it- it happens to be a peaceful and beautiful addition to an already above-average Grandview bar that only 20% of the people in the city even know about.

The comparisons with places like Barley Swine are spot on. Salty Sow represents the dumbing down and commercialization of current Austin and national food trends. It is a good business plan, but not the kind of food I want to eat.\\n\\nSS bills itself as snout to tail dining; there is nothing more adventurous than bone marrow on the menu. None of the produce is locally-sourced. Every dish is cribbed from elsewhere. The brussell sprouts are good, but they are Drinkwell good, not remotely Uchiko good. The duck fat fries are truly awful. Duck fat and potatoes represent one of the most sublime culinary combinations. If you have never encountered that combination before, you might like them, but the execution at SS is very poor. Ditto for the pork belly, which is unsliced bacon, and very badly executed at SS. And so on.\\n\\nThe food is not terrible, the cocktails and the overall vibe are: Uptown Dallas without the guts of pretension. Prices are reasonable, but I felt  like I was sitting in an early episode of Design Stars on HGTV: bland, boring, almost corporate, but not quite suave enough.\\n\\nThey take reservations. Parking is plentiful. It is convenient. So, to sum up: East Side dining for people who don't really want to be on the East Side.\\n\\nSalty Sow is the quintessence of mediocrity. I feel confidant that it will do very well, but if you want eat great food and/or drink great cocktails you are only a five minute drive from Tigress.

This location at Phipps mall isn't ideal, but they've managed to capture the iconic JR feel tucked amongst the high end shops, movie theater, and Legoland.\\n\\nI will caution: Beware the crowds. There can be a serious wait, especially on the weekends and at peak hours. Practice queuing and wait for the stools at the counter if need be. I've seen several conflicts when someone strolls up and grabs a seat out of turn.\\n\\nOn to the food. Obviously, the Johnny Rockets burgers and shakes are the cornerstone of their retro menu. The premium shakes are worth the upcharge. I'm stuck right now because I keep going back to the M&M's shake. I can't get enough of it! But there are plenty of great options. The cookies and cream, the butterfinger, etc. all merit a try.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the burgers, the Route 66 is a solid choice - a little more complex than the usual burger ingredients, but not quite a gourmet item. The Rocket single or double is very good. The sauce has a creamy base that enhances the onion flavor, but adds a dairy nuance that changes the whole burger. Of course, the original is great. You should get exactly what you're hoping for.\\n\\nOutside of burgers, I've always loved the tuna salad sandwich at JR. They just have a great - albeit simple - tuna salad recipe and then put a hearty helping of it on some underrated wheat bread with a little lettuce and mayo. If you want to go lighter, this is a great route. Don't be deterred from tuna salad at a restaurant. It's foolish to avoid it, unless you don't like tuna that is.\\n\\nI've tried the Philly cheese steak. It's also pretty good; it may not be authentic, but it's rich and hits on the same notes as the genuine article.\\n\\nThe fries aren't bad. They're a little generic, but with a little help, they can be really good too. For example, get the cheese fries, but ask for shredded cheese instead of the liquid stuff - way better experience.\\n\\nThe staff are generally good, but occasionally you get a dingbat server. When we get our usual server, he's great, but one time we had a waitress who was clueless. She sat us at one table; then insisted we move. She took forever to bring our milkshakes and they were totally melted. It was a terrible experience, but it was the exception.\\n\\nIf you like cheap and unhealthy and pretending like its still the Cold War, Johnny Rockets is a blast.

Standouts for us were the meatballs and polenta, octopus, and rack of lamb.  The beet salad was forgettable (more French than Italian in flavors/execution), the prosciutto/charcuterie plate was serviceable (although it included maybe two pieces of prosciutto in total), the rabbit pasta was over salted/the rabbit was dry, and the short rib was just okay (very bland, if I'm being honest).  Our kids loved the bolognese, so major points for that.  Happy children equate to happy parents.  That being said this is a 3 star for me due to the service and the condition of the facilities.  First, service: it  was disappointing for this price point - our server seemed like she couldn't be bothered with our table.  Maybe it was the presence of our 5 year old (who is behaved/quiet), but she made us feel like it was chore to help us.  She spent eons doting on the tables around us (everyone else got to hear the specials, was asked how they liked their lamb cooked/to what temp, received refills on beverages - none of which happened at our table), while she barely checked in with us (once - after our entrees arrived).  When asked what her thoughts were re: the short rib versus the lamb dishes, her response was to shrug and say (unhelpfully) \\"they're very different from each other.\\"  Okay.... We wound up ordering a broad selection from the menu - our check was substantial, not including tip.  Her  attitude toward us was just weird.  At the end of the meal she even asked us if we wanted to split the check (we were a party of 4 - a married couple with 2 children). Lots of miscues. \\n\\nAdditional notes re: the facilities - we spent about 15 minutes loitering around in the very narrow front hallway waiting for our table to be prepared after we arrived (it had been cleared, it just hadn't been re-set after the prior guests left).  Last but not least: the toilet situation was not ideal (two small ones at the top of the stairs that lead up to the top floor - the women's was clogged and the hand soap dispenser was empty).

I was in no hurry, so I sat at one of the very eclectic tables under a good sized popup and relaxed.  After just a few minutes, Shyam was back at the window, getting orders (I wasn't the only person waiting!).  He apologized again for the wait, but he had had to close for a couple of hours so he could cook fresh. Who am I to argue with that? I ordered the dholl puri flatbread with Portobello mushroom burry and Tropical Happiness curry sauce. Shyam asked if I wanted my flatbread separately or as a wrap, and if I wanted chutney (I wish I'd said yes to the chutney), all the time holding the balls of flatbread dough in his hands. Hello, does it get any fresher than that? I got my curry first, so it would be hot, and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  So many wonderful flavors, all fused into this perfect dish of fabulousness. And those lentil fritters! When I went to the window to get my bread, I was told it was made of yellow split-peas, rosemary and cumin, and that it was very healthy and full of fiber.  It was also delicious. By now, my husband had joined me (he had gone to another cart because he won't eat anything he can't immediately identify). He tried a little piece of the bread, didn't care for it, and wouldn't taste the curry at all. Bummer for him!  More for me!\\n\\nSince there were no customers waiting, Shyam came out of the cart for fresh air, and started talking about starting his food cart business, and how he struggled the first few months because it was winter (not the best food cart weather in Portland), but how customers started coming on a regular basis, other customers who were familiar with his prepackaged foods were finding him, friends of customers, review readers (like me), and how his business began to grow and succeed, and New Seasons is opening in 3 weeks and he expects he'll be very busy!  I'm sure hoping so. If anyone deserves to succeed, it's Shyam.  Even in a seriously foodie city like Portland, I don't often see anyone as passionate about what he's doing as Shyam."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"2855 NE Town Center Dr","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"Came here expecting a long wait time and was in and out within 5 min. the lines look bad but they seem to have a system down to make it go by fast."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am writing this review (I think my first yelp review ever) because of the blackened red fish dish that I just had.

Our waiter was very good and offered beer suggestions and a small taste sample of a beer I hadn't tried before. I liked it and ordered it with dinner. The surf and turf was a disappointment with flavorless meat, and overcooked vegetables. The Terriaki steak tips were a little better, but still seemed like they were not actually marinated, and just a dash of terriaki sauce was thrown in at the end. I think the pub food and sandwiches are probably what they do best, not the entrees. Desserts were hum drum so we passed on them. The waiter was quick and attentive and was better than the place he worked for, which raised the review to 3 stars.

The dense and moist crumb was great, but led to just an oily flavor of cooked plain dough, and nothing that resembled chocolate or cocoa flavoring and also not even close to being sweet.  The glaze looked like chocolate and with no description except donut in the case label, I'm not sure what it was supposed to be but all appearances pointed to chocolate.  Whatever it was, it was not good and the dusting of cinnamon and powdered sugar when plate served, alone could not save this one.\\n\\nThe bars and pies definitely tempt but g-free donuts are so much harder to come by, I opted for possibly the worst offering in the case.

It was difficult to think which one should we eat first before the others got cold so that was one thing I didn't feel happy about."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Dined there for the first time on 2/28/16 and really enjoyed myself. After living in Atlanta all these years I finally took the opportunity to go see what the rave was about. Service was nice and food was excellent. We had a little bIt of a wait. About 25 minutes I think.  I will return. \\n\\nI. CUISINE/MENU - Everything on the menu seem appealing. Wish I could sample the entire menu. LOL  For appetizers, we started off with Collard Green Spring Rolls and Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls $5.99 each. They were ok. For the main course, I ordered the Uncle Ron's which was 3 pieces of fried chicken with your choice of 2 sides for  $15.75 so I got the Mac n cheese and collard greens. My friends got the Midnight Train $13.50 (fried chicken & waffle very tasty) and Smothered Chicken $15.25 (boneless fried chicken breast smothered in gravy over bed of rice). They were all good. Good portion sizes too. I loved the corn bread. It was sweet and buttery just how I like it. \\n\\nII. SERVICE - Waiting area could be bigger as there was only a small bench inside and the rest had to stand outside. Not good for winter if you have to stand in the cold. Girls up front could be a little bit more nicer and friendlier. Excellent server who got our order perfect and steaming hot. She was funny and attentive. \\n\\nIII. AMBIANCE/DECORE - R&B classic music in the background. Pictures of famous people who have dined there and booths and tables surround the restaurant.  Decent ambiance for families as well as a date. There was a cop on duty at the front. \\n\\nIV. PRICE - Not too overly priced and affordable. My total bill for the 3 of us including tip was $86.62. \\n\\nV. LOCATION/PARKING - Located off a busy street. There is paid parking on the side for $7 paid to a machine. Typical downtown location and can be scary looking if you're not used to it."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Not really sure why this place gets rave reviews. the shrimp toast has no flavor of shrimp; it's essentially like a grilled cheese sandwich with extra cheese on the outside. the curry and pho is okay, but be sure to ask to not have the noodles get overcooked. and the pho broth is meh. the avocado buns are okay, but covered in sauce and strangely fried.

And all the normal plates are at the 2.25+ levels, California rolls, krab rolls (that's right, fake crab for over 2 dollars), everything good. Almost nothing was on the 1.50 plate, which I kept forgetting was not the 1.00 plate (there is none).

Came here pretty soon after landing in Austin. It was before 12 and there was already a line. I waited for maybe 30-40 minutes which went by quickly enough. You can order by the pound, by piece, or get sandwiches. We got a huge beef rib and a pound of brisket. It comes with onions, pickles, and white bread. Also got a side of the chipotle slaw. \\n\\nThe meat was amazing. I loved the dry rub and crust on both. I don't like white bread much but it tasted amazing with it. It's not cheap but I would say it's worth it (I think It was about $40-50 for the above plus a bottle of water). I did not like the barbecue sauce they had at all and I usually love barbecue sauce. However the food was super tasty even without sauce so it was fine. The chipotle slaw was good too but not great; it's actually somewhat spicy but I was able to eat it and I am not a fan of spicy stuff. Personally I like tangier sales rather than creamy ones so it wasn't really my cup of tea. I wish they had a bigger variety of sides but clearly the focus is on the BBQ- as it should be. \\n\\nTo be honest, I didn't eat a ton of barbecue in Austin (a very questionable decision on my part) so I don't have much to compare this to. However I did enjoy this very much and would definitely come here again. Plus, I don't care how good the food is, there's no way I'm going to stand in a three or four hour line like people do at certain barbecue spots in Austin.

Comfortable, a little bit hipster, but not so over-the-top crunchy that I feel like I need to be wearing hemp shoes (I'm looking at you, Life Alive). Since Veggie Galaxy has opened we've been there about 4 times and never ordered the same thing twice. At peak weekend hours you definitely should be prepared to wait at least half an hour, especially if you have more than two people in your party. There have been some hits and a few misses, but overall we're pretty happy with the place. And now on to the food...\\n\\nThe Goods:\\nBlack pepper biscuit - Oh my god amazing. I don't normally like biscuits much but this changed my mind completely. It was warm, flaky, and not too heavy.\\n\\nSeitan chorizo - I really liked the chorizo, which was in patties and has a nice balance of spices. The fiancee isn't much of a seitan fan so she didn't like it.\\n\\nThe club sandwich - One of the best items we've ordered at Veggie Galaxy. The balance between all the different components was perfect.\\n\\nSauteed chard - Again, I'm not usually a huge chard fan but this is perfect\\nSweet potato mash - It's hard to go wrong with smooth mashed sweet potatoes and spices\\nRoasted garlic mashed potatoes - It's even harder to go wrong here. The mashed potatoes were smooth and delicious\\n\\nCentral Square mushroom chickpea burger - Not quite as good as I wanted it to be but still a respectable veggie burger. The balsamic roasted tomato on the sandwich was cold, which I wasn't expecting. I think it would have been better warm.\\n\\nApple crumb pie - The crumb topping was awesome and the apples weren't cooked-to-death, which was definitely nice.\\n\\nLoose tea - Tasty and comes in an adorable tea pot\\n\\nBoylan's sodas \\n\\n\\nThe mediocre:\\nThe BLT - When we ordered the BLT, the tempeh bacon was in really thick slices that were not at all bacon-line. When we ordered the club in a later visit the tempeh bacon was sliced thinner and tasted much better, so maybe they've fixed this issue. I think we got the BLT on the first day Veggie Galaxy was open so I'll give them a break here.\\n\\nGlazed seitan loaf - It was more of a mound than a loaf, and the flavor was a little bit weird. Most objectionably, the center of the seitan \\"loaf\\" was cold. \\n\\nVegetable pot pie - Instead of having a topping like a normal pot pie, there were three big slabs of smoked tofu over the top of the pot pie filling. I'm a tofu fan but this was just too much tofu. I wish it had been some of those delicious mashed potatoes instead. In terms of the filling, it was very heavy on sweet potatoes and the gravy wasn't that great of a texture or flavor.\\n\\n\\nThe Bads:\\nBeer battered onion rings - I love onion rings and deep fried food in general but these were so greasy that they were almost inedible. There was a pool of grease at the bottom of the plate. The batter was tasty but the oil just killed the whole dish.\\n\\nBeer battered house smoked tofu - Again, the batter was tasty, the smoked tofu was okay, but it was way too greasy. Even with the caper dill aoli (which was basically a tasty tartar sauce) it was kind of bland and one note. \\n\\nSweet potato carrot cupcake - I've been baking vegan food years and I know that vegan cupcakes can be great, but this one was not. The texture was way too chewy and it just tasted flat. The frosting wasn't that great either. It was a small cupcake but we still didn't finish it."},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

I was there for dinner in the lovely company of some extended family and my parents. As they discussed the movie, I sat there, completely clueless as to what they were talking about and instead focused on the menu that lay in my hands. It doesn't take a genius, or one to have seen the movie, to notice some Moroccan influences in the menu.\\n\\nAfter some hesitation, I decided to go forego an appetizer and got the house smoked chicken,  served with ricotta dumplings and a side of fresh fig & m√¢che salad. \\n\\nFor dessert I shared a dark chocolate cr√®me caramel, which was plated with some chantilly cream, some chocolate walnut oil and a lattice tuile cookie.\\n\\nWhile the interior of the place is well laid out, the tables spaciously arranged, I found the restaurant to lack in decor. There was a fresque of a scene of the movie painted on one of the walls, but the rest of the restaurant didn't really feel Oriental in any way or form. But regardless, is is warm and invited in there. And quite cozy I must admit. \\n\\nThe food itself was good, the chicken cooked perfectly, and still juicy. The fresh figs in the m√¢che salad provided a nice contrast and complimented each another in texture. The ricotta dumplings were pretty good as well, although they were under-seasoned a bit. \\n\\nAs far as the dessert goes, my half of it was great and my mother had no complaints (a nice change for once, trust me! - (hopefully she won't be reading this.)) \\n\\nOur table split a bottle of wine but I didn't have any - I'm not a fan of white wine. They did seem very happy with it though, as they ordered another bottle of the exact same one later in the meal. The bottle was recommended to us by the waiter.\\n\\nThe service in the place was solid, and most seamlessly from our table and to the kitchen. The only thing is that the prices are a bit high and although my dinner was full of flavor and wonderful, there was a slight lack of value. I thought the restaurant's food was good, along with the service but somehow it managed to miss the mark. I'm not sure what it is about it, and while it's uniqueness to the neighborhood is nice, I was left wanting more from it.

Although, I must admit I probably would have never gone here if it weren't for the Scoutmob. We showed up around 7ish, sweaty from bootcamp at the gym, so needless to say, we stuck out like sore thumbs among the group of mostly Caucasian upper middle class diners (hey, what can I say, it's Sandy Springs).\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very chic, by the way. On the dimmer side, with lots of cozy tables and oddly enough, a couch in one corner with a coffee table and cushioned chairs. \\n\\nOff the tapas list, we got yakisoba and calamari. The yakisoba was OK... I am not a fan of the dish in general, but Blue Grotto's version was tasty (albeit a bit greasy) and full of veggies, no sliced ginger, which I liked. We really enjoyed the calamari. It came with two dipping sauces, one was a white sauce (the better of the two) whereas the second one was strange... I thought it was sweet chili sauce, but my fiance remarked that it was incredibly sour, so I dipped into it and picked up a larger amount of sauce... yup, it tasted weirdly sour. Looking at the menu, I see the two sauces are  Sriracha Aioli & Ponzu Ketchup... hm. I think the aioli was lacking sriracha, then.\\n\\nAs for sushi, I picked the Grotto roll and Ocean roll. The Grotto roll was a bit pricey at $15, but I figured I had to try their namesake, plus when I received the roll, I realized why it was more pricey. The Ocean roll was around $12 and contained spicy yellowtail, cucumber and scallion topped with salmon, tuna and avocado. The Grotto roll contained soft shell crab with cucumber wrapped in soy paper and covered in spicy snow crab, avocado and tobiko. This is one of their most popular rolls, I believe, and it's HUGE. Possibly the biggest roll I have ever seen -- 10 pieces and each piece is on the large side. I definitely preferred the Grotto roll over the Ocean roll -- the latter was a bit on the bland side. I will say that I think Blue Grotto uses a lot of rice in their rolls :/ \\n\\nLastly, I got three pieces of yellowtail sashimi for $6. Not the best I have had, but decent. \\n\\nMy go-to in the area is still Circle Sushi, but I am always happy to mix it up and visit Blue Grotto again. Gotta support my fellow Chinese -- the restaurant is owned by the Wu family, as it states on the menu (either that or I read it elsewhere in the restaurant.)"},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"We have ordered from Rod Dee many times and typically there is no problem.

As for the claim of best burger in Boston, that is debatable.  However, they do serve a very good and hearty burger with a nice selection to choose from.  I myself ordered the buffalo burger with blue cheese.  There could have been a little bit more sauce on it, but atleast they did not drench the burger in buffalo sauce. They cooked it to my preference and I enjoyed the flavor.   And they give you a good size burger for ten dollars.  I did not order the pizza but it sure looked good.  Some people came in after I started eating and raved about the pizza once they started digging into their slices.  That is something I will have to try next time I am in the area.

I called back, and the guy working said that's his mistake, he forgot to put the katsu and curry in the bag.

She assumed I wanted to order that same thing again, and said they made the katsu curry. WTF? I clearly did NOT order it when I called in so WHY would I want that?!  She was mad that I asked for a refund, and was being cheap trying to figure out how much of a refund to give me (she was trying to subtract the price of the RICE that I had gotten last time and only give a refund for the katsu and curry... w o w, you can't get cheaper than that). She was all upset and went to talk to her husband in the back, and he came out asking what happened. She then tried to tell him to forget it, and finally gave my refund, and I left.\\n\\nI called in an order today, and my boyfriend went to pick the food up.

We got oysters to start, which were served on a bed of arugula, not ice. No forks, no mignonette, just some lemon. Ate one and my friend really disliked everything about it (and was concerned that they were not served on ice), so she sent them back as she has every right to do. Instead of sucking it up, the bartender proceeded to act like a baby. His facial expression, the way he handled it, everything that happened afterward was very unimpressive. Not only did he scoff at her for sending the oysters back but he proceeded to tell EVERY single one of his colleagues what happened right in front of us and we became the butt of their really cool jokes/stares/general rudeness. The manager came over and treated us like we had no idea what we were talking about and told us that if we wanted mignonette, we just needed to ask. WHAT? If you have it, then why not give it when you serve the oysters? Makes no sense whatsoever. Nobody ever apologized, they only made us feel uncomfortable and displeased. We then waited over 40 minutes for our third course- cured meat and cheese. Blew my mind that it took that long to slice some meat and open a jar of pickles and roasted red peppers. During this time, we didn't get offered any wine or water. The bartender was right in front of us serving other people and cleaning glassware, but wouldn't look at us. Would it really hurt your ego to provide good customer service and at least say sorry that we were displeased with the oysters?...perhaps ask if there anything else they could do for us? \\n\\nThe ladies next to us also complained about how long it took for their pre-made desserts to come out and were treated very rudely when one of them expressed that she was certain the wine she received was not Pinot Noir (this was a different waiter. He brought the bottle over to her and also scoffed in her face telling her that she was wrong and that they were right- LITERALLY what he said). She had an Asian accent and the waiter had a hard time understanding her and just kept yelling WHAT?! in her face and she tried to express her displeasure. It was uncomfortable to witness.\\n\\nHere's a suggestion- if you are going to act like you are a fancy schmancy wine bar, maybe get rid of the rotisserie chicken overhead heat lamp whatever that is hanging from the ceiling or perhaps use glass instead of plastic cups for your desserts. \\n\\nPlenty of other wonderful dining establishments on the Hill with superb customer service."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The good:  Best Italian I've had in years.

We got there at four on a Friday.  The neon Open sign was all lit up and the big screen in the window said dinner was from 3 to 11.  So we went in.  There was no one there so we took a seat at the bar and waited for someone.  When someone eventually showed up he couldn't be bothered to put down his cell phone to talk to us and instead made hand gestures to tell us that the restaurant wasn't open. No explanation why.  In fact he wasn't going to actually say anything to us until we asked what time they would be open and were told five.  So we killed an hour and went back.  The place is nice inside and we were seated quickly in a mostly empty restaurant.  We ordered a mixed drink and were told that the bartender wasn't there so it was a no go on the drink.  So we ordered something else and when he brought it he also brought the mixed drink (I guess the bartender had showed up) and were told that the non-alcoholic drink would be free of charge.  Which was nice.  The food was okay.  I really liked the veggie mix platter and the other dishes were fine.  It turns out I don't like goat but that isn't the restaurant's fault.

Since being veg, its been a dream to just go to a diner and for once have anything I'd like on the menu, and I give them huge props for indulging veg people in such joy. The spinning cake case just really wooed me. So cool! And beer and wine with your breakfast foods? Why not?! Build your omelette?

We also split a slice of Boston Cream Cake and it was a bit off tasting/dry although the ganache and filling were great.

The second shared course of pork and veal ragu and a side of cauliflower was a perfect fall offering.  Only the carpaccio disappointed, not quite thin or cold enough.  All of these dishes seem a bit mismatched, but the food was savory, the mood was perfect, aided by the ambiance and the lighting, and the delicious magic of sparkling sangria that was not oversweet.

No issues here.\\n\\nStrengths:  Love the exposed brick and the tie in with the rail road theme. With the location, there's nothing you can do about the trains and the noise so they embraced it.

This last time, I decided to try Dirty Martin's again to see how it's held up. \\n\\nI always forget how good a solid flat-top burger is and Dirty's is solid. Thin, well-cooked burger. I particularly enjoyed the seasoning they put on their fries. It made for a flavorful, crunchy bite.\\n\\nThere might as well be grease in the air at this place. With how old the place is and the amount of frying that goes on, it's amazing the spot is as clean as it was the evening I visited. The people were friendly and quick to take my order and the food was a perfect greasy burger and fries.

I hate it with a passion.   There is so much wrong with this place, and so much that is so easy to fix, that it particularly irks me that the place is so horrible.\\n\\nI guess we should start with the basics.  The atmosphere for the most part is cool, except for the fact that they put couples in the couple-ghetto near the bathroom, with tables so close together, it might as well just be one long table.  \\n\\nSo right off the bat, I know that unless I come with a group, I will in all likelihood get squished between strangers and the toilet.  Hell, the other day I came in early, ALL the booths were empty, and they still sat me next to the toilet.  The waiter said they are required by their boss to fill these seats first. \\n\\nNext, when I think Veggie Galaxy (before eating here), I think something like Life Alive except with an atmosphere and seating options that are not unbearable.   That means the choice between a dozen healthy salads, with fresh squeezed vegetable or fruit juice.  But no, you won't find that here.  \\n\\nIn the unlikely event they offer you a vegetable, I guarantee it is deep fried.  This week's vegetable special was deep-fried cauliflower with kung pao sauce.  Indeed, take any non-meat ingredient - tofu, seitan, vegetables, etc, and you can be sure they deep fry it here.  And then it's drowned in sauce.\\n\\nAnd if you don't want something deep fried, well, there are always their star attractions - a choice between a black bean burger and a chickpea burger.   I eat, without exaggeration, at east 100 veggie burgers a year.  I've had all types, all brands, eaten them in dozens of restaurants (even burger king offers veggie burgers now!), and without a doubt, these are the two most disgusting burgers I have ever had.   The chickpea burger is so dry, it might as well be chalk.  It just falls apart if you have the unfortunate need to eat it.  The black bean is just mush.  And they put them both on super-size rolls so that you are essentially eating a loaf of bread with dirt or mud stuck in it.\\n\\nTheir salad options are three.  Just three.  Plain salad.  Beet Salad.  And something in between.  Jeez, just steal life alive's salad menu.\\n\\nSo their tiny menu gives you the option of two burgers, three salads, a few seitan sandwiches which we won't even discuss, and maybe 5 dinner specials.  One option is beer battered tofu.  Might as well drink a bottle of crisco, it is so oily.  Another option is seitan cutlet, breaded and deep-fried.  Which leads to another weird thing about this place.  On the foods that are at least passable, they always seem to go the extra mile to add something to it that will make you barf.  The deep-fried tofu for example should come with either vinegar or tartar sauce (since they seem to be trying to emulate fish n chips) but instead they put on some rancid heavy orange cream sauce that destroys it.  The seitan came with bright yellow bernaise sauce - some lemon cream cheese dreck. An ocean of it no less.  If it didnt have the bernaise sauce, I could have at least choked it down without vomiting.  Hell, at least offer the option to put it on the side!!\\n\\nAnd why don't they offer vegetable sandwiches?  Even Cafe Kiraz offers vegetable only sandwiches or roll-ups.  \\n\\nI kid you not.  We came here for a healthy meal and after dinner, we decided to just eat at mcdonalds because it at least tasted half-way acceptable and wasn't as bad for us.  Seriously!  A vegetarian restaurant where the food is not only unhealthy but it doesnt taste good!\\n\\nWhat makes this all so infuriating is that it is owned by the same folks that own Veggie Planet in Harvard Square!  That place is amazing!  That place is perfect!  How can people operate such a great restaurant offer such a dismal appalling menu here??!  \\n\\nNote to owners:  I'll make you a deal.  Offer at least a couple of things from the VP menu and I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.  Because I WANT to love this place.  I am your target audience.  And I am baffled by the mass psychosis of all these Yelp reviews.  I can only surmise that they are all really good reviews here because people are sheep and they figure even though the food is gross, it must be good and they just don't know better, since vegetarianism is cool and trendy.\\n\\nI will say some nice things though.  The frappes are great even though they could easily kill a diabetic.  And the french fries are perfect.  Probably the best I've had anywhere.  They are fresh, and crunchy with lots of broken tiny bits that are particularly crunchy.  Just perfect.\\n\\nAnyway, I get you're a diner, but could you please try to offer SOMETHING at least passably healthy?  Like why don't you invest in a grill so everything doesnt have to be deep-fried?  Grilled vegetables and tofu taste good too!  And please, learn that a burger should be moist but also have texture.  Hell, sell morningstar burgers if you have to.  Just dump those montrosities you're serving now."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the people in my dining group summed this meal up perfectly: this is legitimately one of the best meals of my life. The filet was so tender that I didn't need my butter knife to cut it. The sauce accompanying it was tasty without overpowering the taste of the filet. My fellow diners had a rack of lamb, which like the filet was more tender than a Texas love song. The orange whip that it came with was well presented, and added an unexpectedly delightful note to the lamb.  Asparagus was perfectly cooked as well. And our third dining companion ordered tamales and seasoned rice. While a smaller portion, the flavors again were amazing. They have weekly ceviche (yellowtail), and we also had the house guacamole. Both were awesome. We ended with the flan- orange tequila topping. There wasn't a weak link in our meal, not even the bread and three options to put on the bread. Mind you, the meal wasn't cheap.

We ordered the happy hour nachos with chicken and the tostones with chimichurri sauce. There was a high nacho to topping ratio on the nachos and the tostones seemed a little stale, but the chimichurri brightened them up a little. We split the cuban sandwich with rice and beans before heading out. The sandwich was underwhelming and tasted like a ham and cheese with mustard, but the rice was nicely cooked and the beans were seasoned well enough. \\n\\nBy the time we left around 8pm, the bar was full and the restaurant was bumping.

I've traveled the world and eaten at veggie restaurants all over.  My sister in law is a professional vegan chef.  So I'm picky.  I went into Veggie Gallaxy with mediocre hopes.  I assumed that the food would be generic diner veggie food, uncreative and sloppy.  It wasn't.  We ordered a veggie burger, some sort of fake meat dinner, stuffed waffles, vegan omlette, a spicy dish with beans I think, 5 different frappes, and 5 different desserts including a chocolate cake, lemon merangue, Boston cream, pudding, and a cheesecake.   A couple of the meals I thought were good, but average. The vegan omlete was really good and not made out of a disgusting mushy pile of tofu like most vegan \\"eggs\\". The stuffed French toast was amazing. The veggie burger was exactly what one would hope for.  The onion rings were sparse, but very very good. The frappes were very shake-like.  Pretty good, but not complicated.  The dishes all had veggies included which was a nice touch that's not normally included in diner food.  The veggies were all cooked perfectly and not mushy, or wet. The desserts were all above avg.  many people don't realize that most vegan cakes you can buy in stores are almost all shortening or earth balance. These are clearly made using high quality ingredients.  The creams and pudding fillings didn't taste like overwhelming soy flavor like most vegan puddings.  Very rich, and perfect consistency.  One of the cakes was slightly dry, but it had a cream topping that added moisture.  The lemon in the lemon meringue Was very strong, and a hair overpowering for me, but my husband loved it.  The atmosphere was good, the booths are large and comfy and we didn't feel like we were being rushed at all.  Our waitress was the BEST most attentive waitress I have EVER had. My glass was literally never half full, and she anticipated our needs.  Other people who worked there said hi and nodded or smiled.

But the place is super popular and gets crowded on weekends, and even sometimes during the week. It seems many Orlando folk enjoy a bit of the Irish every once and again. Like a perpetual St. Patty's day in this lively pub. They even have a balcony for private parties or just checking out to get a little different perspective on the place.

Made anniversary reservations and started looking forward to the night. On a cold winter Wednesday night. My hubby and I headed to the World Trade Center. Parking was convenient, but pricey.\\n\\nWe went inside and waited. And waited. And waited near some old guy with a drink in his hand talking to a younger chick who possibly could have been the manager. After being ignored for a good 5-7 minutes, we went to the bar to ask for help. Finally, a waiter came by and said he could seat us. Unimpressed, but hopeful, we sat down, noticing how NOT intimate the setting was. A big open room with about 6 out of 20+ tables seated. It took awhile for our waiter to come by and even longer to get two margaritas. The salsa accompanying the chips was delicious with unexpected flavors. Our waiter encouraged us to change our original ceviche order to one with more citrus. I think I would have enjoyed my original choice better, but the waiter accommodated our desire for yucca frites on the changed order.\\n\\nThe food was good, but came before our second round of drinks. Fast food, slow staff! Fish tacos were good, but probably would have been better with the slaw on top versus as a side.  A bit too spicy to be eaten alone (and I like spicy). I had the crab enchiladas. The tomatillo cream sauce wasn't too creamy and had a great flavor.  The corn shells had a great combination of soft & crispy.  Overall, pretty tasty, but not \\"to-die-for\\".\\n\\nDessert was fabulous. Espresso flan with just the right combo of hot & cold & sweet. Great way to end the meal.\\n\\nOverall, a 6.

I mean, minimal effort has gone in to setting up the decor, which left them with enough money for the two flat-screen TVs, I guess.  I just feels kind of cheap when you walk in, and based on the prices being charged for the food, there is no excuse for that.  \\n\\nThe music was also a bit too loud, as the two TVs they had installed inside were set to B4U, a Bollywood channel of non-stop music videos featuring the finest in Hindi line-dancing this side of the the Prime Meridian.  I appreciate cultural diversity as much as the next person, but it almost made it kind of difficult to hear my dining companion talk...especially when one of the guys in the video started making some weird sound at a girl that lands on the human ears as a demonic hybrid between a whistle and a death-rattle at near-full volume.\\n\\nSo, we walked in and were seated, and our waitress disappeared for awhile...and then she stayed away for quite some time.  Another group of patrons were taken care of promptly, getting their check, a refresher of water, some friendly conversation in an Indian dialect...all before we ever even had water poured at our table.  \\n\\nLame.\\n\\nEven more annoying was when another family came in, was recognized by the waitress who took their drink orders after seating them almost immediately.  Eventually, she came around and took our order, testing the limits of our hunger-fueled patience.  (Not too many tasty options at 8:30 in Beaverton...)  Still, with the music thumping (and was it ever blasting!) I sometimes thought that my waitress was speaking when it was actually the television.\\n\\nWell, the lamb kurma was delicious, and a tasty compliment to the hot naan.  The various side dishes were also a terrific balance to the flavors of the stronger lamb, and really helped to make the meal complete.  (For $19, I was expecting no less!)  \\n\\nYou can rest assured, the food at Mayuri is definitely worth two stars on its own.  It's just not enough to keep the terrible service from taking a hit.  Give this place a try if you're in town, but make sure you have enough time to spend if it seems that waitress knows anyone else that walks in; your order will definitely take a back-seat to conversation."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.

On the surface of this tastefully decorated restaurant, it appears to be a typical HK-style cafe.  However, the owners have tried to set themselves apart by being more creative with their offerings.  In addition to your typical HK cafe menu items, they also offer made to order noodles (made popular by the likes of Deer Garden and Bubble Waffle) as well as more upscale dishes like lobster, crab, and Peking duck.  For these latter dishes, they offer them a la carte or with a combination of other dishes.  The best part is that they do not charge the usual five-star prices for these.  I didn't get a chance to try these as I had a noodle fix that night. However, it appears that most other tables ordered these items. I overheard the table next to me that ordered the lobster + 2 entree option comment to each other that the food was very satisfying.  The fish soup base of the noodles I had was good.  It wasn't salty or tasted like it had any MSG added.  It's pretty well on par with others that offer this type of noodle soup.\\n\\nService-wise, my experience was positive.  I was warmly greeted by an older gentleman, perhaps the owner or manager?  The server who took our order even gave some friendly suggestions.  While it was busy and there was a waiting line, i never felt rushed out. (I hate it when some places clear your dishes 5 seconds after your last bite then slap the bill on the table.)  When we left, the server even said \\"Bye\\" to us.  That's unusual for this type of place.\\n\\nWhile Honolulu next door has been my go-to for down to earth Chinese diner food when I'm in the area, Happy Day will be stealing some of my patronage now.

These guys are in the old space that once was The Red House Pizzeria and the renovation is swanky. \\n\\nThe interior in the main house is dimly lit and filled with six-top tables, both bar height and regular chair height, you leave the main house to find yourself in a covered deck lounge with live music and more six-top tables and benches on a deck. That meanders into the courtyard patio, which is visible from Manor and the side street. The Patio is charmingly lit with strands of round white lights zigzagging their way across the space and is filled with a combination of bar height bench seating and metal stools of six-top tables. \\n\\nThe six-top tables are reminiscent of Barley Swine community tables, albeit Salty Sow caters to a much larger community.  There will be a bit of a compare to Barley Swine as well, as Salty Sow has small plates and swine, although they are calling it sow. This is where the comparison should end, because the Satly Sow is NOT another Barley Swine. \\n\\nWe found the menu to be a nice combination to suit most paletes and inclinations. \\n\\nThe hors d' oeuvres section had ten items which included notables like: \\n - Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries topped with eggs over easy and diced chives, served with a cold b√©arnaise sauce. While tasty, the portion was extremely large for two people wanting to try everything. The cold b√©arnaise had some dill pickle and thyme characteristics which were quite interesting. The dish was good, bit not sure I would get it again because it seemed kind of like filling up on chips at a Mexican restaurant, and I would love to save room for all of it. \\n - Crispy stuffed farm eggs with bacon and cheese were good. They were served on a bed of arugula with a vinaigrette and had a side of tasty r√©moulade\\n - Oyster Boudin fritters with a chipotle r√©moulade, also served up with the same arugula bed were quite tasty. The batter was Pur√©ed, so you will find no small chunks of the Boudin sausage or oysters in them. I think that might add to the recipe to incorporate a little bit of additional texture so you can pick out the flavors.  \\n - The J.L.T. (J stands for jowl as in pig jowl bacon) on a toasted brioche with herb mayo topped with a fried farm egg.  This open face sandwich was my personal favorite off of the hors d' oeuvres section. It was fresh, light and the perfect combination of vegetables and herbs to compliment the egg and amazing jowl bacon. \\n\\nThere was a Things in a Jar section that served up items in a glass jar with a hinged lid closure. We did not order from this section, but I noted it had a Chicken Liver Mousse with apple gel√©e and pickled onions. \\n\\nThe Vegetables section had six items to choose from including roasted cipollini onions and the one we selected, the Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves with golden raisins and Pecorino. Best Brussels in ATX!\\n\\nThe entrees section of the menu, or as they called it: Ovens, Plancha, Etc., Etc., Etc... offered a selection of nine items from chicken, turkey, beef, fish, duck and of course, pork. To continue on the sharing and small plates experience, we split the Candied Pork Belly served up on a bed of wilted collards that were cooked with ham hock with a soy balsamic syrup. You have to get every part of it in the perfect bite. I needed a moment after each bite to enjoy the tender pork belly (which had more meat than fat) with the earthy collards and the sweetness of the soy balsamic. This is s MUST order when you come here. \\n\\nDesserts, Ice Creams & Sorbets rounded out the menu with a selection of 6 items. We were torn between the Bananas Foster Beignets and the Butterscotch Boudino. At our server's guidance, we settled on the Boudino. This was one of those small hinged jars, filled with butterscotch pudding, topped with salted caramel and cr√®me fra√Æche. It was served with a home made cacao nib biscotti. Each bite was decadently rich and creamy and there was a crunch of salt, but not in an obtrusive way. It was amazing. \\n\\nThey have a good selection of wines/beer/cocktails, but they won't make my \\"Prosecco rules!\\" list. I found it refreshing they offer a Picpoul Blanc on their list. \\n\\nAmy, our server was perfectly charming, attentive and helpful. Jules, the GM also visited our table a couple of times, even helping me photograph the dish by shining his camera flash, so my iPhone 3GS could capture these perfectly at night. \\n\\nThe entire evening, including the $28 bottle of wine came to $81 and change before tip. This will be yet another way they are not like my beloved Barley Swine... but they stand very well on their own four hooves. \\n\\nSpeaking of hooves, when venturing to the restroom, note the men's room has a picture of a boar and the ladies room, a pig in red heels. Pay attention, or it could make for an awkward evening. ;)"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is so good!!

Mind you this dish has a pretty decent spicy kick to it. Mind you I love spicy food and most restaurants spice level is usually not that spicy but Carmelina's did a great job! Everyone in our group had a different dish and all the dishes were great. I had to dock one star because I had 3/4 or possibly 1/2 of my dish left. The waitress didn't bother to ask me whether or not I wanted a to go box. As she grabbed the empty plates, she then grabbed mine and then placed all the empty ones on top to clean up the table. I thought she was grabbing it so she could box it for me. So disappointed I did not get to take home my delicious mushroom rigatoni. All that aside, it was a great place and the food was amazing!

The mood changes accordingly to appreciative and festive.. and in the heat of all the good news, we decide order breakfast instead of appetizers.\\n\\nTo quote a wise friend: \\"I like my pancakes how I like my men... dark, rich, and covered in chocolate.\\" Needless to say, the Taza pancakes were a hit. The cashew cream stuffed french toast also improved significantly, so much so that it may be my new favorite dish at VG. Both are highly recommended, quickly devoured, and induce child-like wonder and delight in any tipsy, ravenous individual. \\n\\nWe order a round of ultimately unimpressive entrees. The Harvard Square black bean burger and club sandwich were satisfactory, but nothing to write home about, and the garlic-y, mushy vegan mac 'n' cheese left me craving cheese. The Mass Ave omelet was conceptually wonderful, but texturally sucky (melted goat cheese + sweet potato puree + soft leeks = creamy goo overload). Dissatisfaction ensues.\\n\\nRegardless of our uncomfortably full states, we all get dessert. The lemon meringue pie was the best anyone's ever had, vegan or not, complete with graham crust, tangy filling, and ricemallow \\"meringue\\", and the thick almond joy cheesecake came in close second.

He wasn't friendly and very short with his answers when we would ask a question. \\n\\nThe reason why this place received two stars was one for the ambiance and two for the very few food items that actually tasted good because majority of it was bad. \\n\\nFor appetizers: stuffed avocado which was very good, definitely recommend. Pork belly was ok just very fatty and the Caesar salad had way too much dressing on it. \\n\\nFor main dishes: the stuffed mushroom was awful!  There was a dressing on it that ruined the dish and didn't even eat the dish it was that bad. -the lamb was very good and seasoned very well. I would definitely recommend.- the fried chicken was just ok. I ordered Mac and cheese for my kids which actually tasted like alfredo. It was weird. And then we ordered fries which came out completely burnt so I asked the waiter to please give us fries that are not burnt. \\n\\nFor dessert: the pecan pie was very good and the white chocolate bread pudding was soooo good. \\n\\nAfter we ate the waiter took absolutely forever to bring our checks and never even said have a good night or anything to us at the end. It was just a horrible dining experience with not that great food.

Not just Chinese food, but xiao long bao and Chinese broccoli, which I haven't had since we visited New York last year. The buzz around the internets is that Helen's is the place to go--maybe the ONLY place to go--for xiao long bao. So, a group of us hit up Helen's, curious to see if her food stood up to the buzz.\\n\\nIf I were going to rate Helen's on the food only, I'd give it five stars. I can't say how authentic or not authentic the food is, as I've never been to China, nor lived anywhere with a real Chinatown, but to my American (gorilla? cough) palate, the food was great. (I *don't* like overly Americanized, syrupy-sauced Chinese food that you'd get at Panda Express or Mark Pi, or at a Chinese buffet. I have an American palate, but it does have its limits.) \\n\\nWe decided to eat family-style so we could try a little bit of everything. We ordered the xiao long bao, the shao mai dumplings, Chinese broccoli, General Tso's chicken (yeah, I know--it's the one Americanized dish I really love, and theirs was almost as good as Yau's Chinese Bistro's), shrimp pad Thai, a scallion pancake, and various little appetizers. The biggest hits were the pad Thai, the xiao long bao, the General Tso's, and the Chinese broccoli, but we didn't have anything that we just absolutely didn't like. I want to order off of the Sichuan menu next time, now that we have our bearings a bit. (Richard P., you are the man for translating it and putting it on Yelp. Those of us with more adventurous eating habits thank you.)\\n\\nI'd give Helen's another half-star if I could, but I'd knock a half-star off for service. I don't expect the same kind of service in an Asian restaurant as I do in an American-style one, but we never had our water refilled, and getting alcohol was quite an adventure. Still, the servers were friendly and accommodating, despite the fact that they were clearly busier than they expected to be. Helen herself was on the floor, taking orders and bringing out food. Our server was able to split our check effectively without making it overly complicated, which we appreciated.\\n\\nThe things I would have changed: more water refills (please!); getting our to-go orders for absent menfolk in a little earlier, as we had to wait a long time after our meal was done to get them (we told them when we were ordering that we were going to have to-go orders, but they didn't get put in until we were done eating); a drink menu at the table to streamline our imbibing of alcohol. \\n\\nThings I would never change: THE FOOD, which was delish.\\n\\nI will definitely be back.

It sounds good, and I was wondering why I was wholly unimpressed with the quality of the porterhouse which was full of all kinds of connective tissue that my knife couldn't even cut through.  \\n\\nAs it turns out, saying beef is \\"AAA\\" is about as meaningful as saying the USA's debt rating is \\"AAA\\".  It isn't what you think it is.  AAA beef is actually analogous with the \\"Choice\\" level of beef in the USA (the second level down).  The highest level of steak in both countries is \\"Prime\\".  And don't ever let someone in the states tell you that college wives tale about \\"Grade D beef that is only fit for convicts and college students\\".  The four levels of beef in the states are Prime, Choice, Select, and Standard (Descending Order).  -1 for having such a highly marketed steakhouse and not using the highest quality of beef.\\n\\nNow that that rant is done, I'm here to tell you that Hy's caesar salad is made fresh table side and is absolutely tremendous.

Next up were the oyster boudain fritters - all three of them arrived. This is a big issue for me. There were 4 of us at the table, but only 3 fritters.

When they arrived, I asked our waitress if she could get us one more and she seemed confused but then said she would have to charge us for another order. We declined. Just something that I get annoyed with. Speaking of our waitress, I was not impressed. After these two items that came out relatively fast, we then waited about 30 minutes for our next round and the following arrived all at once: fries, brussel sprouts, pork shoulder w/ the beans and escarole, steak, heirloom tomato salad and tuna. it was very poorly timed, especially since we had zero room on the table for much of anything else. we were never offered side plates and since they are tapas/family style, the dishes were not served with a separate utensil for serving. \\nNow, the ambiance - it was very, very loud.

Each baguette piece had only a couple small pieces of strawberry, the apples were so thin that there wasn't much flavor there, the grapes had all fallen off the baguette so I had to keep putting them back on, and the toasted almost overwhelmed the entire thing.

I didn't say anything because I was not interested in spending another 20+ minutes waiting for him to correct it.

This is quite possibly the worst Asian restaurant in Quincy."},{"name":"Harp & Celt Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"25 S Magnolia Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything about Harp and Celt begs to be loved. As much as I want to oblige that quality and charm, I simply cannot in good conscience. \\n\\nI am floored by the number of five star reviews this establishment receives, but I've got some ideas as to why...\\n\\nPrimarily, If you're a regular who wants to stop in for a pint and some chit chat, you will probably always have a pretty pleasant experience at Harp and Celt. If you're not, well... I'd bet your experience is pretty mediocre. Secondarily, you don't particularly care about quality and flavor and you enjoy an overpriced and underwhelming dining experience, which would make this place your perfect stop. \\n\\nI ordered four menu items so I could try some of the traditional long-time favorites that everyone seems to adore. Scotch Egg, fries appetizer with curry sauce, whiskey wings, and cottage pie. \\n\\nBeginning with the first two menu items: the scotch egg was damn tasty and the hp sauce definitely compliments the dish. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Fries... man, what a bummer. $5.25 for \\"a large serving\\" of steak fries, add $2 for curry sauce. In reality, I'm in the hole $7.25 for a handful of steak fries and brown gravy that someone threw some curry powder into. This had to be a joke. Outrageous price for what it was. \\n\\nWhiskey wings get their own special paragraph: wow. Just absolutely unbelievable. These were hands down some of the worst chicken wings I have ever eaten. Although cooked perfectly, They were hardly sauced and what little sauce was there was completely forgettable. It had absolutely, positively no flavor whatsoever. None. Maybe just a slight hint of butter. No spice. No whiskey. No richness, depth, or character. Just crispy wings with a pathetic smattering of flavorless sauce. I almost wanted to cry because these wings had serious potential but were served in a very unfit manner. \\n\\nCottage pie: I don't know, it was tasty but overly salted. I wasn't wowed by it. \\n\\nAs for the service, well, the folks serving aren't necessarily unpleasant but I didn't get the impression that they are particularly focused on customer service or going above and beyond. Swearing, griping, \\"I don't give a damn\\" sort of attitude... I don't know, I don't find it especially charming. \\n\\nMaybe Harp and Celt just isn't for me. Maybe I don't \\"get it.\\" Maybe I ordered the wrong menu items on the wrong day with the wrong kitchen staff. It's possible. I'm not closed off to the fact that sometimes timing isn't on your side. \\n\\nBut, what I know: food should be flavorful and have character if I'm at an actual pub or restaurant and not at McDonald's. When you tell the staff it's your first time at their place of business, maybe a more welcoming attitude and ambience is a better concept than loosely throwing around profanities and not giving any semblance of a damn at all about how you portray yourself and how that portrayal can affect a customer's experience and taint a first impression. Most importantly: if you're going to charge a moderate amount for food, can you please make some effort to actually serve something that stands out? This was some of the blandest, saddest food I have ever put to my lips. \\n\\nI don't relish the fact that I had such a mediocre experience at Harp and Celt. The physical atmosphere is great, the patrons are down to earth and pleasant, and the location is convenient for those who live downtown. However, the whisky selection leaves a lot to be desired for an Irish Pub and the food isn't up to par considering the prices. \\n\\nI would only recommend this place for a pint after work and nothing more. I will not return. Instead I will stick with Fiddler's Green, which has always been tried, true, and consistently excellent with similar prices, more genuine service, and a far superior whisky selection."},{"name":"Trattoria al Forno","address":"Disneys Boardwalk Resort, 407 - WDW DINE","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"I would dare say the food here is better than at the overrated Be Our Guest restaurant at WDW.

Located across Congress st from the water, there are still nice views of the harbor. I was seating promptly with my reservation (indoors).  The waiter took drink orders immediately but was a long time delivering both beverage and food.  The guacamole makers double as bus-boys and impromptu waitstaff, but it was never quite clear to whom any requests or concerns should be directed during the meal. \\nThe mocktail margarita I had was uninspired.  There was a pink fruity component, topped off with a very heavy pour of sour mix.  Since it was 80+ degrees, it would have been a good opportunity for some frozen lime concoction, but no such luck for me! \\nFree chips and salsa were fine.  The goodness here was in asking for something \\"spicy\\", we were awarded the house-made habenero paste.  It was indeed spicy, but made everything more delicious. \\nThe guacamole is ludacris for any party under 4 people in size ($14).  It includes free refills, but there is no good option for smaller parties, which is disappointing. \\nThere were 3 vegetarian options:  quesadilla (an app), vegetable enchiladas, and cheese enchiladas. \\nMy cheese enchiladas were similarly mundane.  They were nicely plated and had standard sauce but nothing special in terms of taste, texture or quantity.  All the dinner entrees come with black beans and rice.  My dining companion's braised chicken enchilladas in green sauce, on the other hand, were delicious- the sauce was rich and satisfying.  The creamed chipotle spinach was a little off the mark with large bites of stringy spinach floating in a soup of spicy cream sauce.  This dish needed a greater spinach to cream ratio, and the spinach pieces needed to be smaller (or even food processed) to make the dish thicker overall, and less soupy."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is a hidden gem a little off the usual downtown strip.

The appetizer was great, but the dinner took over an hour to get to us, we tried to understand because it was busy but once received, the waitress had ordered the wrong dish for me. Finally another 30 minutes pass and I finally received my dish and it was terrible, my boyfriends was not stellar either, our waitress was no where to be found, most of the experience as well. It took us forever to get our drinks, and to re-order more took even longer. The dinner was a disaster none the less.\\nThe Manager came by to ask of our experience and apologized for the issues. We received a email a few days later from another Manager apologizing for the terrible experience and he would honor our next visit. Nice! Well... not so much.

Prior to going for dinner, I had browsed the website and their menu. Both my friends and I were excited since everything looked and sounded delicious. Upon arriving, the space is beautiful. Absolutely love the space and decor. My friends and I had came on a Thursday night for dinner. Finding a table wasn't too bad even though there was a fair amount of people.\\n\\nNow onto the most important part: the food! My friends and I had ordered their bento boxes since we were pretty hungry. I had gotten the chicken karrage bento box and the other two got the shrimp tempura and the broiled mackerel. I also got the chargrilled avocado temaki. As for drinks I had asked the cashier what's their most popular drink. She was kind to suggest their matcha latte. I got mines hot and my friend got hers iced.\\n\\nThe wait for the food took a bit of time. When I got my chargrilled avocado temaki it was really disappointing. It lacked flavor and there wasn't anything special about it at all. You could've honestly made it at home. While still waiting for our bento boxes to arrive, we got to sip on our drinks. Man, was that a huge disappointment! You would think for a Japanese tea house and their specialty is matcha it would taste relatively good. It was far from the word \\"good\\". The matcha latte (both hot and iced) lacked any matcha flavor. I was basically drinking warm green water. Even Starbucks makes a much better matcha green tea latte. I was pretty disappointed since the cashier had suggested this \\"popular\\" drink to me. Thanks but no thanks.\\n\\nThe bento boxes could've been better. I've had much better chicken karrage elsewhere. It was pretty salty. The pickled vegetables on the side was a failed attempt by trying too hard to make something so simple, so terrible. My friend's shrimp tempura was pretty salty but bland too. The broiled mackerel was good. Overall, the portion for all 3 bento boxes was disappointing. You didn't get much and it was pretty expensive for what you're getting.\\n\\nWe tried giving their desserts a try in order to redeem themselves but even that was a fail. There's no disclaimer that their cheesecake is only available on weekends and I think they ran out of their soft serve. Their baked goods didn't impress me. Dinner was a total fail that we literally walked around the corner to Shiki to make up for the overpriced, lame dinner here.\\n\\nWould I come back? Most likely not since it was pretty disappointing and if I do it would probably be to try another beverage and maybe a baked good. The staff is friendly and attentive.

I'm just simply astonished because not only was it overpriced but the wings had no original flavor, texture or anything memorable about them that would make me return and I've had better waffles at seedy diners.

Before our order was called I loaded up the green and red salsas available at their salsa bar as well as some very juicy lime slices. The veggie taco turned out to be way more worth it than the chicken taco. Chicken taco was bare with only chicken and the tortilla essentially.

And Sichuan food means numbing spices and chiles and chili oil, which is very unique to the cooking in that region of China. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\n-Wood Ears\\n-Mung Jelly\\n-Garlic dry stir fried green beans\\n-chong xing chicken\\n-Twice cooked pork Belly\\n-White Rice\\n\\nThe appetizers tend to be cold style dishes, though the mung jelly came out warm but pleasant. I would really love to order the pig ear next time and I recommend trying it also if you're open to trying new things. The wood ears had some jalepeno and garlic, chili oil, and had a great flavor. The appetizers come out in a fair sized bowl, so definitely bring your friends/family so you can share it all. The mung jelly had the numbing spices and were in chili oil, but for Sichuan cuisine could probably kick up the spiciness several notches. Garlic dry fried green beans is always a winner. The Chong Xing Chicken are little nuggets of fried chicken, quite crisp, with numbing spice and dried chilies, and was a chicken dish my husband specifically has been looking for. My personal favorite was the twice cooked pork belly, it had a lot of depth of flavor from the black bean, garlic, chili oil, all mixed with cabbage, pork, leeks, onions etc. I don't care to rate service or restaurant conditions, that's whatever, I'm here for the food and it was quite good! Husband was in a really good mood afterwards lol. I'm glad to be able to have found a go-to Sichuan food place, as the best I've had have been in Los Angeles so far. In terms of Sichuan spiciness, it's a little on the tamer side, so maybe ask the server if you can order it spicier if you *really* like ***spicy***."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Big fat juicy burgers!
