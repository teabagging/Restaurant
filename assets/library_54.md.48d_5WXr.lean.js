Both items were quite good and the burger was large with plenty of fries.

It comes with a generous serving of the meat of your choice, avocado slices, and other stuff, including a large amount of cheese. I'm not sure if they actually eat burritos with a lot of cheese in them south of the Rio Grande or if they simply decide \\"hey, this fat gringo probably loves cheese!\\" whenever I walk in, but I'm not complaining. \\n\\nI usually call ahead for pick up and get two burritos, one for now and one for later. Though if you're anything like me you will begin eating that second burrito minutes after completing the first, like the disgusting animal that we both know you are. \\n\\nSometimes you may feel frustrated with El Pueblo. It can be hard to get a table sometimes because dudes just hang out and drink beers for hours on end. Most people who work there don't speak that much English, so a little knowledge of Spanish is necessary. Also, it can sometimes inexplicably take like twenty minutes to get your check after the waitresses picks up your plates. \\n\\nEl Pueblo is not wrong for any of these perceived faults.

They've never failed us until this past Sunday. When we arrived (5:30pm), they had quite a few people waiting to be seated. We went and told them the number of our party (2) and checked in. We were told there was a 10 minute wait. We stood there for maybe about 10-15 mins before our names were called to be seated. Not bad at all!!! So when they called us to seat us, we both noticed them walking us to the far left-side of the building near the kitchen area. At that time it was a lot of opened tables for both large and small parties to be seated. We looked around at the patrons awaiting a meal and they looked frustrated. We noticed why after waiting 15-20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. The waiters were just casually strolling around as if no one needed serving while sitting at the tables. The waiter that chose to help us took our beverage order and apologized for no one assisting us. Next, the waiter brings our beverages back...my husband tried the new \\"Cucumber Lemonade\\" (that's so refreshing and delicious) and I wanted my favorite Arnold Palmer! He brings the drinks out with which appeared to be sugar around the rims of our glass! But once we tasted our beverages and noticed that they were salty sweet, we then noticed that the sugar appeared to be salt! We flagged the waiter down and told him and once again he apologizes and takes the drinks away. We wait another 5 minutes and our waiter comes back out, but with no drinks! He then goes over to acknowledge a new family of 6 patrons and begins to introduce himself and take their drink order! At this point, my husband and I began to get frustrated! I think the waiter could feel our eyes piercing his soul so he turns around and say \\"your drinks are coming right out\\"! At this point, we thought drones were going to deliver them because he sure in the hell didn't have them and we are at a 20-30 minute wait now with no drinks nor food! He hurriedly walks away ÔøΩ?and comes back with our drinks. We taste them on the spot to make sure they are indeed right this time and they were! He asks us if we need more time to look at the food options and I think my husband and I were synchronized when saying \\"NO\\"! We put our orders in and sat patiently while eating bread and drinking our drinks. Another 15-20 minutes goes by and another waiter or maybe management staff brings our food out to us. He does the whole cheese shredding dance with us onto our food and we indulge finally!  By this time, we're starving and just ready to eat. We both ordered the same thing which was the \\"Chicken Alfredo with Broccoli\\"! The food was warm but not hot and the chicken wasn't seasoned at ALL!! I assume they felt like the salt on the glasses of our beverages would make up for the unseasoned chicken/pasta! At this point we're so hungry we just chose to season our own food with the salt/pepper shakers on the table which was fine at this point! After we finished eating it took the waiter another 20 minutes to acknowledge that we're done eating. He mozzies on over to us and because we've sat there ample enough time waiting, we knew what Cheesecakes we wanted to order and to close out our tabs and bring the check.

Highly recommend their fried stuffed tofu, fried shrimp ball (that mayo sauce is so good to eat with it together), steamed rice roll with fried donut, and baked custard roll (so soft!). The turnip cake and the bean curd roll were my least favorite because I felt they didn't have too much flavor. I also ordered stuffed eggplant and pork stuffed sticky rice (not in the pictures). They both were tasty too. Overall, the service was great! The entire team worked together to serve the customers, not just one specific person.

Right at the top: \\"Order at the front counter before taking a seat.\\"  Ugh. How do fancypants cooks not realize this is EXACTLY how McDonald's functions?  Is that the model they're trying to emulate?  \\n\\nRule #3 makes things slightly better: \\"We clean your table for you.\\"  Well, Hat Yai's an improvement on Pine State and Lardo, then.  Eff those places.\\n\\nI ordered the skewers because the only fried chicken I eat is popcorn style and I don't know what the hell anything else on this menu is.  \\"Rich Malayu style curries\\".  Without a hyperlink on that it's singularly unhelpful and since there's a crowd of people milling around behind us, I'm not holding up the line by playing twenty questions.  Of course, the skewers are described as \\"Golae style\\", I don't know what that means but I figure it's a skewer, right?  How can the people of Golae, what or wherever they are, screw with it?\\n\\nWhat I also don't know his how much chemical burn these are coming with.  There's no stars or tear drops to indicate options.  I take heart that a few menu items are described as \\"spicy\\" and \\"very spicy\\" and hope for the best.\\n\\nI order two steak skewers and a side of sticky rice.  The cashier tells me there's two skewers to an order, but I've been down this road before and I'm suspecting these $5 skewers only have about $2 of meat on them.  I persist.  Two skewers.  The GF orders the fried chicken and a cocktail, I get a beer. \\n\\nThen we pay.  Hipster restaurateurs of Portland: THIS. IS. ***STUPID***. If I want another beer, I'm not braving the mob to order one.  YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON MONEY!  \\n\\nWe sit at a dirty table because it's the only empty one we can see.  It took a few minutes to get it cleaned even though it's right there in a pretty small space.  The guy was nice enough but clearly not an experienced busser.  But why would a hot new Portland foodery bother hiring one of those.\\n\\nMy skewers come. Sure enough, they're undersized. Honestly not enough to feel ripped off, but if I'd only ordered one I'd have needed a second dinner.  The beef is okay, it's skirt steak so it's chewy but only one piece was inedible.  It had no particular flavor other than beef, so maybe Golae is Thai for plain?  The rice wasn't any sticker than what comes out of my rice cooker.  But it's a decent meal and only $13 before drink and tip.  Not terrible, but eh, whatever.  I'm missing whatever the five star reviewers are raving about.\\n\\nI'm almost finished with my food before my girlfriend gets her dinner.  Why can these hype joints not get this right?  RED ROBIN can deliver all the plates to a table at the the same time.  I'm not willing to chalk this up to new restaurant because Toro effing Bravo can't figure out it, either, after all their years in operation.  If you can't time your cooking, you shouldn't be cooking in a restaurant. End of story. No excuses.  But JW, you say, the HYPE!  Feh on your hype.\\n\\nI had a few bites of the GF's fried chicken.  It was good, I guess, but so is Popeye's.\\n\\nTotal came to damn near fifty bucks.  Felt a bit steep for two mildly undersized dinners and two drinks, with tip.  Maybe I'm just getting old.  The $10 burger still feels a little expensive.  Still, I feel all the reviews about overcharging were unwarranted. I didn't feel stolen from.  \\n\\nMostly I was frustrated and irritated at the poor service endemic to Portland's food scene.  At least Hat Yai didn't try to make us bus our own tables.  I mean, I wouldn't have, but it was nice of them to volunteer.  Hire some waitstaff and I'd be happy to explore the menu.

I don't spend much time in the anonymous corporate park portion of Dublin, so I had no idea TY Ginger even existed.\\n\\nWe have two other places in town that serve dim sum - Sunflower and Fortune - but if my visit on a recent Sunday is any indication, TY Ginger exceeds them both in terms of the tastiness and quality of the offerings.\\n\\nIn typical dim sum fashion, we ordered way more food than we would normally eat at one sitting, and of course consumed it all.  TY serves most of the usual dim sum classics - har gao, shiu mai, char siu bao, etc - and to a one they were all fresh, well made, and spot-on tasty.  It's traditional cart service, and actually the servers seemed pretty nice, if slightly harried; usually you can count on the women pushing dim sum carts to be kind of rude and surly, but these servers weren't.  One of them even remembered a dish we had asked for that she didn't have, and when another server brought it out, she made sure to bring it over to us herself.  The manager told us the dim sum chef was recently arrived from Hong Kong, and it shows.  This is dim sum of a quality that even our food snob Cantonese dining companion was happy with.\\n\\nAs you would expect of a new dim sum place of this quality, it was pretty full when we arrived around noon, but the hostess was pretty efficient in getting groups seated.  Word of warning, they won't seat you if your entire party hasn't arrived yet.  If you're impatient, and don't want to wait, you can sit at the bar as well.  If you do this, pro tip - sit on the end away from the entrance, it's next to the kitchen door, and you can nab all the new stuff as it comes out of the kitchen.  TY Ginger is pretty snazzy for a place that serves authentic dim sum; between the blond wood trim and the George Nelson pendant lamps, the atmosphere made me think of it as the Northstar Cafe of Chinese food.\\n\\nFor a number of years now, if you were jonesing for dim sum in C'bus, you had okay options, as long as you could accept that you were in the midwest, not either coast or Asia.

When I asked what was vegan, the serving staff gave me a menu and didn't elaborate. I assumed that this was just a lack of preparation, and brushed it off.\\n\\nWhen I found out that I'd be coming here again, I came prepared: I contacted the restaurant using its its online form, and explained my situation. The manager assured me via email that the cooks had made vegan dishes before, and that the restaurant would work hard to accommodate me. When I arrived, however, it was a different story. The bartender recommended I eat the caprese salad, until I reminded him there's cheese in it. He then gave me the gluten-free menu, which is not helpful. Finally, the manager was called out to explain to me various dishes on the menu that the kitchen could make without their cheese or seafood.\\n\\nThese experiences were upsetting for a few reasons. First, they demonstrated to me that the majority of the staff at this restaurant have little to no understanding of what ingredients go into the food served there. While this merely inconvenienced me, what if someone had an allergy? Secondly, this taught me that the restaurant is fully willing to sell me deficient dishes at full price. Presumably the cheese and the seafood ingredients were added for a reason: whoever designed the dish must have thought, \\"these ingredients need to be added for this to be complete.\\" Without those ingredients, the dishes are lacking (flavor profile, texture, etc.).

I think that in itself deserves a very big round of applause especially since that would be half the restaurant for this small business. Staff here were able to get us two booths and a long table in the corner so that the whole group of us could sit together which was very smart of them. Nothing but praise for the seating plan. \\n\\nTheir menu is huge. There's a large selection of dishes and varieties that you can become overwhelmed with what to order (especially if you have difficulties with choosing, ie. Me) but there's a 3 item combo on the first page in which you can mix and match items from there so a lot of us chose from that menu. \\n\\nBoth the combo and bento boxes also come with miso soups as well! \\n\\nOverall, think the sushis or anything with fish and rice is pretty average for Vancouver. If you are getting the combo though, highly recommend the chicken karaage and yakisoba dishes for the bigger dangs for your bucks. Even the bento boxes are pretty worth it for the prices you're paying. \\n\\nThere's actually another Japanese restaurant right next door and when we were coming to this one as well as when we were leaving, we didn't see any customers eating at the one next door so, this is probably more of the local favourite. There were also high schoolers here as well so like I said, probably the bigger bang for your buck. \\n\\nPerhaps we took up a lot of the restaurant or they've just always got an influx of customers but I sat facing the door the entire time and there was a line up at the door the entire night!"},{"name":"Epicure Market","address":"1025 Cannon Dr, Ste 105","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't even know where to start. My friend and I came here for dinner thinking it would be the perfect place to grab a bite and enjoy some wine together, but boy were we wrong! Everything started out ok, but by the time our meals came, the evening took a turn for the worse. We ordered the hummus plate, the salmon entree and a seafood medley (that sounded amazing on the menu). Once our food came, we realized that there was no way that we could possibly eat the seafood dish because all of the seafood was still in the shells. We politely asked our server for the appropriate silverware, but that still didn't help. The lobster was overcooked and completely glued to the shell, and the other seafood was so drenched in watered down marinara sauce that we couldn't even get the shells off without covering ourselves with sauce. All I know is that what happened next was literally the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. It was so bad that I left the restaurant in tears and woke up still in shock about what happened the night before. After our server realized we were having such a hard time with the seafood dish, I think he went to the kitchen to get the owner, who happens to also be the executive chef. The owner angrily walked over to the bar where we were sitting and yelled at us that he \\"WOULD NOT BE GIVING ANY FREE HANDOUTS\\" to us and that he didn't care if we wrote a bad review because he has so many good ones. I don't even know where this came from. He continued yelling at us and making us feel like we were disgusting people for doing absolutely nothing wrong. The way he spoke to us and belittled us was unacceptable. I don't understand how so many people could have had such positive experiences here. To make things even worse (if that was even possible), when we asked for our check (again, after being so rudely accosted by the owner), he had the nerve to throw up his hands and yell,\\"YAY! You can leave now\\". He made it very clear that we were not welcome, as he most likely does to all women who come in here.

She also kept forgetting to bring the box and silverware some people in my party asked for. We had to get a manager to do so. Then at the end we mentioned we would like the check as we had an appointment. Instead she just kept taking things off our table and not bringing the check.

I can truly say this place is one of a kind. Sipping delicious sour beers, next to a warm open fire on the farm was a dream in itself. \\n\\nThe beers were tasty and very unique. At 6PM, they do a tour which I found to be very intriguing. While getting a tour of the place, they explain the processes of how their craft brews are made. Everything from the hops, fruit, and even the local well water is unique. They emphasize that the beer they make reflects the location of where its made. This resonated with me because the crafted beer is a true product of Texas and cannot be replicated anywhere else. \\n\\nAnd of course, after consuming a couple of beers you can go enjoy some pizza. I saw alot of families enjoying their time with their children, munching on some pizza & sipping beers. It was refreshing to see the kids laughing & running around the farm and not glued to an Ipad or iPhone. Jester King really creates a feel good environment for everyone in the family to enjoy. \\n\\nMy experience here was nothing short of magical and I wish I lived closer so I could come to this place more often. But I am happy I was able to enjoy my night while it lasted. \\n\\nCheers to the Jester King's Brewery! :)"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I dig this place. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. I've been here a number of times and it works well for casual dates and \\"burn time before the main event\\" occasions.\\n\\nThe food is fantastic. They do it tapas style, so the portions are small, slightly on the expensive side and sharable for two (usually). I don't think I've had anything on the menu that I didn't like, the best thing, usually saved for last, being the Popcorn and a Movie dessert tapas:  \\"Buttered Popcorn\\" gelato, homemade candy bar, drizzled with a root beer sauce and sprinkled with bits of caramel corn. Soooo good. \\n\\nUsually I'm picky about price vs volume of food -- but Swift's selection is so nice and it is so well set up to share in wonderful flavors, I let that go. Again, a great date place.\\n\\nI'd have given it 5 stars, but my one tiny gripe is the service. It's not horrible, mind you, and in fact, I've had some wonderful servers attend to my date and me. However, there have been times when the the front host desk seems a little \\"stand offish\\" and when it's crowded in there, there is not a lot of room to stand and the host desk doesn't help out with where to stand. It can cause a few awkward moments. My suggestion is just to power through it, ask for a seat at the bar (which, by the way is manned by some great bartenders), and go enjoy the food!"},{"name":"Island Hopper","address":"91 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I'm so surprised I haven't reviewed Island Hopper yet!

We asked the waitress for it after 5 mins of receiving our food. She forgot and  we tried to flag her down again, but to no avail. They arrived after we were basically done with our meal. The Thai iced tea was 90% ice. On the bright side, it had a rich tea flavor and was not overly sweetened. The coconut mango horchata was surprisingly very good. \\n\\nThe restaurant is fairly small. We did have to wait about 20 minutes for a table around 1p, which is not bad considering the wait times mentioned in other reviews. \\n\\nOverall, it is overpriced for the amount of food. Our meal was $40, and we both left unsatisfied."},{"name":"Olive Branch","address":"115 W 3rd Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"Vacationing from NJ...and I must say this place is amazing...I felt I was in nyc...food is by far very authentic and amazingly delicious...extremely friendly staff...wine selection A+...being from out of town I am extremely happy I walked in here to have dinner...very satisfied I highly recommended if your from up north and know what real Italian food should taste like, you will be happy to discover this place"},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is amazing!

The stores are stocked with yummy refreshments and they offer made-to-order food and drink (QT Kitchens). Customer service is typically much better at a QT when compared to the service received at other convenience stores. QT's employees seem relatively well-trained. QT is like the Chick-fil-A of the convenience store industry.\\n\\nThis QT opened in March 2018 on Howell Mill Rd in between Defoor Ave and Chattahoochee Ave. If you're familiar with this neighborhood, you know Howell Mill and Chattahoochee can be a very busy intersection. That said, I don't think this was the best spot to place this QT. If traffic is bad, this location can be a pain to get to. Despite the Howell Mill address, you can only get in to and out of the property via Defoor or Chattahoochee (which makes sense - no way an entry/exit on congested Howell Mill would've worked). The immediate area is prone a lot of traffic congestion, more than the areas around most other QTs, so keep that in mind.\\n\\nThe gas prices here are comparable to other QTs in metro Atlanta. In fact, I've seen gas prices at this QT that were lower than the prices at the QT near my workplace in Marietta (located outside the perimeter in Cobb County).

Very attentive to us, refilling waters and coffees often and just very polite and kind.\\n\\nFood was fresh: Fruit (fresh bananas, apples)\\n\\nBuffet: Nuts, dried fruits, breads, muffins, croissants, cottage cheese, juices, individually made eggs/omelets and sides."},{"name":"Ty Ginger Asian Bistro","address":"5689 Woerner Temple Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"We have been coming here for years!

Columbus really only has two other places that do Dim Sum and they are both horrible. Because if this, I went in expecting mediocre Dim Sum.... man was I surprised! They must have had three different carts circulating each with at least 8 dishes each. Being in R&D for an Asian food manufacturer I of course had to pretty much try everything!

Sorry!\\n4 Rivers has a following locally similar to Chick-fil-A on a national scale. If you say anything negative about 4 Rivers you better expect a lightning strike and the zapping of your tongue inside your heathen mouth. \\nI get the brisket and the sausage. Those are my favorites, but they have other excellent offerings like ribs, smoked wings, burnt ends, pork, chicken and jalape√±o poppers. \\nI think some of what sets 4 Rivers apart from other BBQ spots is that they use really high quality beef for their brisket and other meats. I have eaten at most of the locations and they are all consistently good with really good meat. They don't cut any corners and it tastes that way. \\nThey also offer good sides. I prefer their collard greens and corn, but their other sides are good too. The greens come complete with big hunks of meat and minced garlic. I'd love to copy the corn recipe at home if it weren't so prep intensive. If I had any complaint it would be that their mac and cheese is pretty basic, but that is stretching it. \\nTheir ice machine and drinks are even good. For those of you from NC or SC you'll be happy to see they offer Cheerwine which you can't find everywhere. \\nThey have good sauces to compliment their BBQ also. I like the hot sauce. It has a little kick, but not much in my opinion. They also added a mustard sauce and it is really good with the sausage. It might look/sound strange, but I like to mix the mustard sauce and hot sauce. \\nThey also offer a ton of desserts, but I'm there for the meat and haven't tried desserts yet. I'll save that for an update. \\nEnjoy!\\n********\\nMy Standardized Yelp Ratings\\n5 stars - This is for a place that I see as one of the best at what they do (steaks, sandwiches, BBQ, seafood, etc). 5s are for places I've been several times (typically) at least and never had an \\"off\\" experience. The food quality, service, price and atmosphere are all going to meet or exceed expectations.\\n \\n4 stars - This is for a place that is good, I would drive a little out of the way to go, and the food and service is good, but maybe not amazing. Also for me, this could also be a great place that serves Pepsi products - automatic 1 star loss - bad management decision. \\n\\n3 stars - This is for a place that I view as standard. Nothing special, nothing lousy, not a place you'd avoid like the plague, but a place that is not one you really look forward to either. \\n\\n2 stars - This is for a place that had something go wrong or something perpetually wrong. The food and or service is likely consistently suspect here (they probably serve Pepsi too).\\n\\n1 star - I can't see wasting time writing a review on a place that gets a 1 star. This is for a place that should consider closing."},{"name":"Reach for the Pie","address":"44 Margin St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"My family and I order from here all the time.

I worked in a restaurant years and years ago and the rule was you serve people right up till closing time and you let them finish their meal.\\n\\nI love how they handle this. Closing time is when you stop serving people not when you throw people out, lock the doors, and go home because you're already done with all your cleanup and closing tasks.

There are plenty of other places on 3A and in this area that you can go to with the same environment and an owner that is actually respectful and understands that her customer is what keeps her business going. I suggest Wild WIlly's, Coop's, Cagney's, The Stadium, Wallburger's, and Beer Works.\\n\\nThere were 6 of us for dinner and drinks tonight. Things all started when my friends' salad and appetizer, which she was having for dinner, came out early. It wasn't a big deal, we're pretty easy going people so we didn't think twice about it . She just waited. It would have been a regular run of the mill night, but then the bill came.\\n\\nMy friend had purchased certificates with restaurant.com and I'm sure he'll write more about that piece of it, but my problem is with the way the manager and owner handled the situation.\\n\\nThe waitress was very helpful - she went to find more information and basically did all that she could to get our questions answered. Thank you!\\n\\nThe manager then explained that the coupons could not be combined and therefore we could not get the dollar amount off we had expected. Again, not a big deal, but then when we asked if we could separate the bill to use the remainder of the coupons, the owner came over with a very abrasive attitude and told us very rudely that we could not use the coupons.\\n\\nAfter dinner, we approached the owner. My friend wanted to explain her frustration with how the situation was handled, but the owner was not listening to her. My friend was not looking for her to honor the coupons, however because the owner was not listening this is what she thought. The owner stated she had a business to run and she would not honor all the coupons. Again, this was not our point. I stated we thought she came off very abrasive. At this point, the owner stood up from the table she was sitting at and got very close to us saying that is how she likes to be. We said we would not come back and she said that was OK with her. I don't know why she would want to drive away business when every time I've been in there there are only about 3 other tables. \\n\\nOn the way out of the bar, a woman turned to us and told us we were not supporting local business and that we should. I will not ever support any business, local or not, that does not respect it's customers. Respect is something everyone should give to each other, whether it's a business owner to a customer or just two people walking down the street. As I walked out this woman was talking and pointing at our group. If this is the clientele Fore River Grille wants then I am happy to say I am not one of them.\\n\\nClearly, Fore River Grille does not respect it's patrons. It has become yet another dive bar with the type of customers Weymouth does not need. I encourage you to avoid this establishment."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had the Mother Earth bowl - AMAZING!

After that we ordered a roasted Apple with maple syrup and cheddar cheese, delectable. To finish we ordered a smoked salmon hash with a creamy horseradish sauce.

Don't love the overflowing volume of oil dripping off the sandwiches."},{"name":"Ping","address":"102 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Ahh, the three-star Yelp review. Three stars is right in the middle. The little note next tot he rating says \\"A-OK\\", but we all know that 2-stars sucks and 4-stars means, at very least, \\"I would go back often\\". So three, for me, is right in the middle, and that's frankly where Ping stands after my first visit. \\n\\nI have done a fair amount of traveling in Asia and SE Asia. Not as much as Andy Ricker has, for sure, but I got around (and off the tourist path) enough to have a decent idea of what Asian street food is. To me, it's cheap, tasty grilled meats, noodle bowls, rice balls, and the like. The food tends to be on the sketchy side, but delicious at the same time, and the experience plus the low price are the factors that seal the deal. \\n\\nWhen I head Andy was opening up an Asian street food place in Old Town, I got excited. What I miss most about Asian food (and local food from other faraway places) is the grilled meat. No matter where I go in the world, grilled meat on a stick is pretty much ubiquitous. \\n\\nAfter waiting the obligatory couple of weeks after opening (I am not a fan of the crowds that new restaurants draw), I finally made it in with a few friends to check the place out. A quick read of the menu has me stoked! Lots of different skewers with flavors from all over SE Asia. Chicken butt, chicken heart, lamb, baby octopus, fish ball, etc. Just like the little street-side grills all over Thailand (although those always offer hotdogs and all other similar sorts of cheap processed meats too). \\n\\nThen I saw the prices. $2.50 to $3.50 per skewer, and the skewers are pretty small. Plus, you have to order at least 2 of each type, so that means that you can't try a large variety of flavors unless you are with a large group (the space is BAD for groups), or you want to spend $$$. Now this irks me more than most because I associate this type of food with being very inexpensive. Spending $2.5 for a taste is doable, but $5? What should be a fun menu of many different tastes quickly turns into a big bill if you want to get the full experience. \\n\\nI did not get an opportunity to try the ramen dishes or other noodle options, which may be a much better value at $7, so I should probably hold some judgment for that. But our group of 7 sampled about 6 skewer options, all tasty, about 3 or 4 meat dishes, the toast with egg/coconut custard, mieng kam, and steamed buns, and with 2 rounds of cocktails, the bill came to $180+ (18% grat added).  Those are high-end dining prices, for street skewers. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I can spend $ with the best of them, and yes, the skewers were very tasty. But honestly, they were nothing more special than what I would get street-side in Thailand for $.25/skewer. \\n\\nThe space is a fun little place dressed up to look like an izakaya. It's too small for big groups, but the servers will do what they can to accommodate.  The service is very friendly and on-point. The decorations, utensils, metal cups, and such all lend a really fun, Asian-style vibe to the place. Definitely a fun place to go after work for some beers and meat. \\n\\nI guess if I hadn't been to Asia, I would have more appreciation for what Mr. Ricker is doing here - he's bringing something fairly authentic and fun (and unique, in this town) to Portland. I wouldn't mind getting bites and a couple of cocktails for $20/person after tip. But this style of food, in my mind, was meant to be inexpensive, and the way they serve it up (minimum order of 2 of each type of skewer) makes it restrictive for a small group or couple to get a good sampling of the food. And while tasty, the flavors simply do not justify the hefty ding in the wallet. \\n\\nI plan to come back again, probably by myself, to order the ramen and other noodle choices. This may change my mind about Ping. Until then, it will be somewhat of a thorn in my side. It will be that place that has the food I want to eat, but at prices I am not willing to pay. Maybe every time I want to eat it I will stick $20 in a jar, and within a few months, I can just buy myself a ticket back to Thailand instead."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good BBQ with great sides, I love the Yuca Fritas.

We were shown a large table in the back (crabby toddlers)  who were also provided a packet with crayons and twisty tie things.

I was brought back to her dining room with one taste, and I'm sure she's pleased. \\n\\nMother NEVER eats greens but she asked to take the rest of her spinach home for breakfast. Her lobster roll reminded me of a piece of birthday cake; the meat stood tall and proud in a beautifully toasted roll and tasted just as life affirming (we shared).

We were greeted with a round of waters and a smile.  Our order taken soon after and our bogo wine delivered with yummy bread for the table.\\n\\nDinner sides are fairly large plates so my friend and I shared the Fajitas de Churrasco.  Strips of delicious seasoned skirt steak with onions and sweet bell peppers.  All served with warm tortillas, back beans and rice as well as normal fajitas compliments like sour cream, pico de gallo and cheese.  The sizing was perfect to split and super tastey for sure.  My friends hubby chose the masitas de puerco al ajillo dish filled with chunks of pork and grilled onions. We also shared a side of tostones that are large in size and deliciously fried.\\n\\nOur waitress was busy (as the night) but she was on top of serving us and tending to our requests.

We explained the problem, she apologized and said they would fix a new pie for us. Our original server then came over to tell us he didn't know there was a problem (a quick glance would have told him that the pizza was overdone) and assured us it would be about 10 minutes for the new pie. Wrong! Try 30 minutes. Meanwhile, our friends are eating THEIR pie slowly to wait for us. Ugh...\\n\\nThe replacement pie arrived via a different server who told us that the variety we ordered tends to be crisp because of the oil. What? Oh yeah... oil dries things out.

I have to say that I was not a fan of this burger combination. There was just a sprinkling of feta, the tapenade was tasteless, and there was way too much pancetta. All in all, the flavors in the speciality (and very pricey) gourmet burger were not balanced correctly. I know it's hard to make a gourmet burger, but when it's priced at $10 I expected a little more thought to be put into the preparation of the toppings. \\n\\nHowever, the burger patties were incredibly fresh all around. I probably would have been better off just ordering a plain cheeseburger. The strawberry shake was good as well. The garden salad was typical, but the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers were fresh and we didn't have to pay extra for dressing. \\n\\nOverall, I think the price is fair considering the area, especially with how high the rent probably is.

Honestly, they are understaffed.   You read all the reviews and 95% of it has to do with staffing issues, it's true they need to add a server.   Not that our server wasn't a good guy and who was hustling it.

Unsure what the deal was since we were there right when they opened and had reservations...only 2 families seated...one would think the hostess would man the front.  \\n\\nMother's Day buffet - pretty good, $21.95 per adult.  Fruit tray was good, veggies tray looked fine (sorry not a fresh veggie guy at 9am), pasta salad was good.  French toast was good, sausage was very good and bacon was perfect for my tastes.   No scrambles eggs tray but they did offer a fresh omlette bar which my wife said was good.   I did try the egs benedict which I normally don;t like but enjoyed (light on the lemon, much better); but the prime rib - delicious.   Was a great cut of beef and so well seasoned.   Definitely some highlights here that made it wort it.  Pastries were fine, never made it to the dessert trays (which were limited but it was 9am).  \\n\\nHad to ask for our check, not a big deal but you could see the staff was often almost running to get where they needed to be.

I was incredibly surprised by the decor -- the sign outside doesn't at all correlate to the interior of Beat Hotel. It's beautiful -- decorated, but not overdone. There are natural, rustic touches, with soft lighting and comfortable seating all around. It's very spacious for a restaurant in Harvard Square.\\n\\nOn weekend mornings, they start brunch at 10am, an hour earlier than most other places in the area. This is a huge plus. When we got there just around 10:30, the place was fairly quiet and empty but the live jazz band was already playing, which made it feel like an intimate private concert. The music was just the right volume -- not too loud for conversation but also not too quiet so as to make us strain to hear them.\\n\\nThe food was served quite quickly. I loved the omelette with goat cheese, leek, and kale. It was just the right combination of textures, the egg was soft and moist, and the bread that accompanied it was whole grain and hearty. The home fries were sliced lengthwise, as if they were fries rather than cubes, and crispy and salted appropriately. The Eggs Benedict was soft, served on a bed of salmon and English muffin, and the Hollandaise was creamy and sour, though not as sour as I personally prefer.\\n\\nOverall, though, the service was great. Loved the ambiance. I could hardly believe I was steps away from the bustle of Harvard Yard while inside Beat Hotel.

Oh well, I guess the Franchise Office is not very keen about the interior standard of each shop.\\n\\nHere comes the Pho, I really love the large bowls they use since it has enough volume to hold the proper amount of soup so that the noodles do not get all dried up if there are not enough soup in the first place.\\n\\nTasting the broth first before adding anything is usually how I start, and immediately the saltiness hits by taste buds.  The presentation was good but it was really a bit too salty, the pho was el dente and had the nice chew to it, beef was also very dry and even soaked in the broth for the whole duration, they were still dry and chewy. They do have more beef tripe  then other places but that still doesn't make the Pho complete.\\n\\nIts a pity that the standard of Pho Hoa varies so much from location to location, their addition of Jazen Tea in each of their location is a good touch but still you have to keep focus on the main item which is Pho!!\\n\\nWon't recommend this location!"},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"3596 Far West Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Welcome, Wendy's, to the \\"nasty list.\\"  Several visits ago, I was told my order was delayed because they \\"were waiting on meat.\\"  Tonight, our drive-through order was incorrect and when we returned, they again tried to screw up the order -- in the EXACT SAME WAY.\\n\\nJeezus, Wendy's, it's not that hard to get an order correct, especially when you even repeat the order back correctly."},{"name":"La Fiesta Mexican Grill and Catering","address":"3000 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We have been here twice now and have really enjoyed the food and drinks.

Another example - he asked anyone ordering burgers if we wanted cheese on it. I figured the cheese was on the menu and he was just making sure we wanted it on there. Nope. My slice of Kraft American cheese was a $1 surcharge. It's only a dollar, but I thought it might be nice if he would have phrased it that way when he asked us. Transparency, you know?

After our waiter greeted us, I knew this place was going to be excellent.  From the food to the service (granted the place was nearly empty) this is one of my favorites around the area.  The waiter new his menu items and was really personable, which you don't find at to many restaurants these days.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, a specialty drink, lobster club sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a Dragon roll.  The meal was excellent, especially the lobster club sandwich.  The menus you find online through yelp and urban spoon can be a little misleading because they've changed their menu items.  Best advice would be to go and try the place out.  Or call ahead and ask for some of their menu items, because if you see something online and choose to eat there solely based on that item you might be a little disappointed when you get to the restaurant and they no longer offer that particular item.

Good job bakery! \\n\\nBeer Cheese- after all the hype, I'd have to say I was sorely disappointed. First, it's not hot, it's cold... so cold that you can't really dip your pretzel in it without it getting stuck and breaking off into the cold smear.  Definitely needs a knife...which is awkward to use spread on such a small pretzel. Second, it's SUPER SALTY. Reminds me of a hard version of Frito Lay Cheese Dip. Not extremely flavorful or spectacular. \\n\\nchex mix- also SUPER SALTY. Think Chex Mix crushed into smaller pieces so it's awkward to eat + a pound of salt.  Not in big enough pieces where you can actually put one piece at a time in your mouth. You kind of have to pour it in your hand and throw it all in your mouth at once. Not very lady-like. OR maybe, they just gave us the bottom of the bag. \\n\\nJerky- very very dry & salty. pretty standard for jerky. nothing to rave about. \\n\\nhouse mustard- delicious!!!

Being from Tennessee, I had low expectations but I wanted BBQ so decided I would just tolerate some average stuff to satisfy my craving.   Let me start with the pulled pork - plenty of bark and was not over-sauced.  Just a hint of sauce mixed in.  Definitely wood smoked and tasted like it had a little oak in the hickory mix but was good.  Importantly, they got the bun right - soft spongey roll that was fresh and held it all together.  Brisket - also authentic and good.  Unusual to get good brisket and pork under the same roof.  I don't think they crutch the brisket.  Result is lean but tender brisket with fat separate from meat instead of cooked through it. Wedge salad - money.  Great dressing and comes with two pieces of homemade bacon.  Worth the $9.    Only thing different than my expectations was that the pulled pork sammy doesn't come with a dollop of cole slaw on top.  Most places either put it on or ask you if you want it - similar to how burgers normally come with cheese.  I went and got myself some slaw which was very good too.  Meats were good enough they didn't need sauce but sauces seemed good enough if you like a lot of sauce.  Service was very good.

My partner and I went here for Valentine's Day. It was our first time dining here and we were very disappointed. First of all, we made the reservation about 3-4 weeks ago but still had to wait 35 minutes for our table whilst standing in a cold vestibule area near the host stand. I get that Valentine's Day is busy, but they could have offered us something at the bar while we waiting as there were seats open there. The two hosts were very nice though. They had to continually run up to the 3rd floor by foot to see if our table was ready. You'd think management would figure out a more reasonable way for the hosts to check on table status. The waitstaff was excellent. No complaints there. Biggest complaint was the food itself as well as the pacing of delivery to the table. The scallop tartare didn't have much flavor. Lobster bisque was great. My tuna entree was AWFUL! The exterior color was off, the fish was overcooked and it lacked seasoning. The tuna didn't have flavor! I then combined some of the surrounding veggies with the tuna to make it more palatable, and wouldn't you know, some of my potatoes were RAW! By raw, I mean that I couldn't even slice my knife through it. When the meal had arrived to the table, it seemed like it had been sitting there for a long time In the kitchen. It's wasn't even mildly hot. Much to his credit, the dining room manager offered to replace my meal with a new one. However, I don't like to waste food so I declined. Dessert was good. In terms of delivery, it took 30 mins between our lobster bisque and entree. Just felt like we had to wait far too long for the food to come out and that when it did, it just seemed like it sat a long time before they brought it to us. So, it was an epic fail.

We had a reservation and were seated pretty quickly. The service was pretty awful. We felt rushed the entire time, and it felt like our waiter was hovering and checking in too frequently, trying to push us along so they could turn the table over more quickly.\\n\\nWe were seated and told the specials and that it was \\"Shrimp Fest.\\" He said he would bring some Shrimp Fest menus over but never did...not a clue what was even on the menu. We never saw it. It was pretty busy so we just ordered off the regular menu. We've had the Point Judith Calamari before, but this time, it was warm and soggy. Not hot and crispy as it should be. Like it was cooked awhile ago and left sitting for some time before it was brought to us. What was worse was, we hadn't even finished our appetizer and bread, and they brought our entrees out. What the heck! Also, the bread used to come in a nice basket lined with paper and a little dish of whipped butter. Now it gets brought to you on an individual plate with foil wrapped butter. Not the same. Not as appealing. \\n\\nDo NOT order the Wild Grilled Gulf Shrimp. For $26 I got a huge pile of mashed cauliflower, corn and tomatoes, and FIVE TINY SHRIMP with a sad little pile of crab meat on top. The shrimp were NOT grilled. Tasted like they were cooked sous vide and kept hot in sous vide. No grill marks. Not fresh. Tasted frozen and thawed and sous vided. I didn't even finish it. Honestly it tasted like a meal I would expect at Red Lobster. I think even Legal Sea Foods could do better. Not the quality I would expect from Turner's. At least my husband enjoyed his Boulliabaise. But he has ordered it before and it was different. Why would they serve it with bread and rice...? Just weird. \\n\\nTurners. I don't know if they got a new chef, or new management, maybe both.

When we finally spoke up the gentleman behind the counter gave us a smerk and told us we given an hour wait time...not true. When we finally got on the bowling lane we given timely cocktail service, but when the drinks came they were all watered down. When asked if there was even alcohol in the drinks, she responded 'you're drunk, you've been drinking all day, you have no idea what your talking about.' What kind of response is that to a paying customer? Again we shut out mouths and attempted to finish our game of bowling, but what do you know? One of the lanes was broken!

The Balsamic Strawberry with Black Pepper was so good. Good strawberry flavor, with a nice tang and acidity from the balsamic and a hint of heat from the black pepper. \\n\\nThe Pear with Blue Cheese is not what one may assume, it's creamy and had a light pear flavor that was sweet and floral. The small specks of blue cheese was a good salty contrast to the ice cream, added a tad bit texture and bits of saltiness. Since blue cheese to me is a bit floral in it's aftertaste, I thought this combo was great! Their version of Honey Lavender might have pushed Bi-Rite's (in SF) to second or third place. Lovely floral lavender, not too much where it's soapy or seems perfume-y, perfect amount of sweetness and in a natural color. The ice creams here melt well, aren't overly sweet and are so creamy. \\n\\nWait wasn't that bad, there's a line for a reason! The interior of the store isn't that big but has a few spots to sit.

It seems like a scam because they only have an abbreviated version of it that they actually serve and keep telling us, \\"we'll serve the full menu from next week.\\" But that week hasn't come yet and it's been that way for months.  I wonder if they try luring in customers with a nice menu and actually just serve very limited items.\\n\\n-- The food used to be above average but has started tasting like crap of late. For example:  \\nTheir Paneer Tikka Masala was swimming in oil and had a powdery texture to it.  Their veggie jalfrazie is not a jalfrazie at all, it's undercooked steamed veggies.  Their channa masala (with undercooked garbanzo beans) tastes like someone added sugar syrup to it.\\nSomeone forgot to tell them that they should serve chutney with an appetizer like the hara bhara kabab\\n\\n-- All said and done, the quality of their food and the scam they have going with their menu, does not justify the high prices at all!  Give me good tasting food any day and I will pay a higher price and still eat - but not this junk.\\n\\nOh and FYI - Americans do appreciate authentic tasting food, you don't have to sweeten or undercook or over-grease everything for the non-Indian crowd.

I told her she is welcome to give me a new one, instead she makes a new one same situation falling off the side I let her know I wouldn't be back!

I think was on there about 3 years.  My first attempt at Rino's was a bust as they don't take reservations and it was a 2 hour wait.   Obviously coming at 6:30pm on a Friday night is pointless, so save yourself the trip.\\n\\nThis attempt was better thought out.  Monday at 4pm.  As soon as they opened.  I barely ate all day in anticipation.   My friend and I got a table but by 4:30 they were packed.   \\n\\nAlthough they are known for their lobster ravioli, I was really in the mood for chicken parm, so that's what I ordered.  I've had it at numerous places and it's always a classic.  It's kind of the staple I use to compare who makes it best.    My friend got the Fruti De Mare.\\n\\nHoly cow was it good!  Not only was it a huge portion but the flavor was outstanding!  Probably the best I've ever had.  That food is definitely made with love because each bite made me feel better about my life.   The chicken was crispy yet tender, the sauce was hearty and tangy, and the cheese was perfectly melted.  Served over some homemade pasta made this an absolute delight.\\n\\nI tried my friends enormous plate of seafood and it was also delicious.  The red sauce completely made the dish.\\n\\nVery friendly servers and a decent selection of wine just completed this wonderful experience.   \\n\\nGetting a table takes a bit of strategic planning, but I assure it is well worth it.

Our server made sure to explain that was how the food would arrive, and we had no problem with that.\\n\\nMy only gripe about the whole experience is the communal seating concept.  We arrived in the midst of a somewhat serious, certainly private conversation.  The hostess directed us first to a massive table at the front, already occupied by other parties.  When I explained that we were in the middle of a private conversation, she directed us to our own table, but really, with minimal room between tables, it was hardly our own table.  At one point the waitress actually tripped over my foot, which was only slightly \\"outside the lines\\" rather than directly under the table.

What was original just a state of mind for me became reality today during my visit to Chicken Guy!, a fried chicken counter-service spot conceptualized by Guy Fieri and company in the heart of Disney World. This place wasn't on my radar until booking the trip to Disney World, but I'm so glad I unearthed its existence when planning for my winter getaway. In the words of Guy, this place is OUT OF BOUNDS!\\n\\nSeriously, lots of good things to say. First, 30 SAUCES! Something for everyone here to enjoy, included Guy's patented Donkey Sauce. Without getting too in depth, I tried the Donkey Sauce, Nashville Hot Sauce, Bourbon Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce, and Cumin Line Sauce. All winners, with the Nashville Hot Sauce and Donkey Sauce being my two favorite. The Nashville was the perfect balance of spicy and sweet, with a nice hit of acidity and not too much of that \\"thick\\" consistency you get in a lot of sweeter sauces. The Donkey Sauce was more along the lines of a garlic aioli and I found it to be great with the seasoned fries. Am I a mayo and fries convert now? Probably not, but I'm more open to the idea, now.\\n\\nThe chicken, of course, was great. Organic, never frozen. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Fairly reasonably portions on the strips. Delicious with the assortment of sauces. Fries were great, too. Not over cooked, not soggy, and coming with a dash of spice (think old school diner fries with salt, pepper, and chili powder) that kicked up the flavor a bit. I don't eat fries a ton, but I gladly ate all of mine.\\n\\nDid I mention it's affordable? $11.95 for three strips, fries, a drink, and two sauces. AT DISNEY WORLD! I've paid a whole lot more for a whole lot less at amusement parks. The food was not only good and generously portioned for the price, but i got to experience the ambience and allure of Flavortown without the premium price tag. \\n\\nIt's my first night in Disney World for the week, but I'm thinking this might be a hard meal to top.

Alyssa had no concept of personal space, social cues or the ability to grasp the fact that she was severely creeping out not only us but all of the tables around us. Here is a list of some of the things Alyssa did during our one and half hour meal at Southern Kin: she did the sign of a cross to herself to a fellow table; she offered the table next to us her personal umbrella to take home with them; she handed a table next to us a steak knife blade first saying \\"be careful you wouldn't want to get stabbed\\"; she repeatedly touched a diner next to us on the shoulder who was visibly uncomfortable with her.\\n\\nNot only was Alyssa wildly missing out on social cues but she seemed to materialize from the floor right into your personal space every time so came to check on our table, which was about ever sixty seconds. Despite her constant attention to her tables, a draft beer took about ten minutes to reach our table. Watching her was like being trapped in an SNL skip except you were paying for the experience and it was hard to enjoy your food know that she would be back to check on your table sixty seconds later. It was also obvious the management was aware of her creepiness as we were continuously checked on by the manager and other servers ran her food for her. \\n\\nBy the end of the meal, the entire strip of tables was laughing at how awkward and uncomfortable their experience was. To sum it up, Alyssa seems like a sweet girl and A+ for effort, but someone needs to sit this girl down and discuss with her the concepts of 1) how to make polite server-guest conversation; 2) personal space; 3) how not to flat out creep out your customers. \\n\\nin all the experience was laughable but not terrible -- the food was enjoyable and I would give it a second chance.

I tried to check their wine list from their web site before we came, to see if I could find a wine I wanted to try.  but no wine list, or even a sample of, is posted.  please post a portion of the wine list so people can make an informed decision.\\n\\nnow this brings me to the final poke in the eye, their ARW offering....  this was date night for us, I suggested my wife order from the ARW menu and I will just order a few things ala carte.  we had to ask for the ARW menu, it was not suggested (maybe that was a hint).  \\n\\nwhen it came time to order, I shuffled things.  I had to \\"politely suggest\\" to my wife/date that I should order some of the items exclusive of the ARW meal.  she was a little surprised as I suggested she may like other items.  later, my suspicion was confirmed, and her mood quickly turned.  if she had stuck to her original selections from the ARW selections, it would have cost us MORE than ordering from the regular menu.  yes, you can pay MORE for the ARW menu.  \\n\\nshe was very disappointed,  ARW had always been our foodie version of ACL or SXSW where we try many restaurants in a short period of time, with the idea that they make a special deal to bring in new customers.  \\n\\nwhen the check was issued, I asked to see the regular menu once again.  our server winced and bit her bottom lip.  as my wife added up everything she had for her ARW meal, there was a $1 savings over regular menu, and had potentially cost us more using the ARW menu.  \\n\\nI don't think we will be back.  most things tasted good, some of it was too salty.  the salad was mediocre at best and difficult to eat in the dark.  it was not a nice evening.  why should we pay nearly $100 (for two) to sit for 90 minutes in a dark noisy space and have to do so much math to figure out the ARW offering is s reasonable option, or not.  \\n\\nfailing to meet expectations when I have so many other options...  flash in the pan is what will result from this business model.  disappointed is the word that best describes our expectations.  long term success involves pleasing most/all customers.  not trying to cram as many people in as possible when the iron of popularity first strikes."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went to the Butcher Shop for our anniversary on 10/20.

Consistently expanding, Assembly has brought a modern, comfortable and relaxing vibe to the heart of Somerville.  Its newest addition, Southern Kin, only a mere week old, has definitely earned its keep thus far.\\n\\nWe came on a Friday night fairly late around 9:00pm and were told by the hostess that the wait at this time was about 45 minutes to a hour for two people.  Because it was such a nice night and we wanted to explore around, we left a cellphone number and received a text message telling us when a table would be ready.  Fortunately, we checked in a little earlier, having to wait only 30 minutes, and a table just opened up. \\n\\nThe presumed manager greeted us, apologized for the wait, and stated he was grateful that we're giving Southern Kin a try.  This welcome was already enough, however, to make up for the wait, he stated he would send over free biscuits, but failed to deliver on that promise.  \\n\\nAlthough we were slightly disappointed by the manager, the waitstaff was otherwise extremely attentive: water glasses were always full and we were consistently checked on (not just by our waiter, but other waitstaff as well).  \\n\\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out: I think that this is Southern Kin's only flaw.  We were told that the kitchen was backed up.  Hopefully they can work out their kinks since they are new on the block. IMO, the addition of complementary bread and butter or something along those lines could help ease the harsh turnover of food.\\n\\nHowever, when we received our food, the presentation, taste and temperature of it all were perfect, which also makes for great Instagram food porn ;).  We ordered Chicken N Waffles (Southern fried chicken over cheddar chive waffle, with fresno pepper-maple syrup and Louisiana honey-hot pepper sauce, $21) and the Frogmore Stew (Caramelized scallops, shrimp, and mussels with andouille sausage, red potatoes and sweet corn in tomato-okra broth, $28).  The broth in the Frogmore Stew was delish - if it weren't so strange, I'd lick the whole plate!

We split two dishes among three people and were stuffed! We opted for the Fish & Mussel moqueca, a signature seafood stew with cilantro, tomato and onion. It's also served with rice and pirao. The fish was fresh and the stew had plenty of flavor. I loved this dish! Additionally we tried a meat plate, the Feijoada Completa with black beans, pork, sausage and bacon. This comes with a side of collard greens, friend plantains, farofa and orange. While each meal was completely different the both had a lot of flavor, however if I returned I'd probably get a fish or shrimp moqueca\\n\\nIf you like spicy sauces, be sure to ask for their hot sauce -- but be warned and have a water glass nearby... it's one of the spicier sauces I've tried recently.\\n\\nLastly, we saved room for dessert. The coconut & tapioca pudding-like dessert was great for sharing and we also got a small chocolate truffle. Both were good, but the coconut & tapioca pudding was the best!\\n\\nTo conclude, Muqueca is worth returning to for an authentic Brazilian meal. Not only are the servers patient with people like me who are unfamiliar with their cuisine and the food is AWESOME! Their prices are reasonable, especially considering the large portion sizes.

Very small dining area means it fills up really quickly so you have to get there early especially if you have a big party, but it is definitely worth it.  The atmosphere combines the impression of the formal classiness you associate with nice Italian restaurants and the feel that you are at a private party with all of your closest family members.  The food was absolutely delicious starting with the appetizers.   I had the Peperoni Ripiene to start things which were roasted red peppers stuffed with ricotta cheese, sausage and broccoli rapi baked in a fresh plum tomato sauce topped with basil olive oil.  Every bite was so good and I got some high expectations for any entr√©e to top it.  Luckily, Rino's delivered again with the Vitello Bracioletini, which was veal stuffed with Italian cold cuts and cheese, pan seared with mushrooms in a Marsala white wine lemon butter sauce.  The mix of flavors was blended perfectly to make an exceptional dish that left me quite satisfied.  Finally, you can never go wrong with tiramisu, but they also had an extensive dessert menu which offered something for every taste.  Rino's menu had all of the classic dishes and more, and their broad specials menu had a lot of different intriguing dishes.  Despite their great food, the best part of Rino's is the exceptional service and atmosphere.  A very attentive wait staff was there for any request or question and was also very entertaining too.  At the end of the meal our waitress gave even more evidence to Rino's treatment of all patrons as regulars.

Maybe it was the tacky \\"No Pasta, No Potty\\" sign prominently displayed in the window, maybe it was the cheesy red interior that makes it look like a caricature of a restaurant. But last night we decided to give Maurizio's a try and wow was this place great!\\nThe place wasn't very busy when we got there, so we received great attention from a white-haired woman who I assume is the owner, and our waiter, Leo, as well. They were both very nice and seemed happy to have us. \\nWe started with a good and affordable bottle of Chianti, and we also got the eggplant/ ricotta/ sun dried tomato appetizer. Before the appetizer, we had a couple small pieces of bread, along with some fresh, tart olive oil. I could eat a loaf of bread and a bottle of olive oil every time I go out to dinner, so I'm glad they gave us a small portion so we didn't ruin the treat that was yet to come. \\nWhen the eggplant appetizer came, it was in three medium-sized pieces, and after eating, all I could think was that I wished they had it as an entr√©e. It was so soft, so light, it almost melted in your mouth, and contained so many flavors and textures it was hard to believe it consisted of just a few simple ingredients. Very, very good start to the meal.\\nAfter the appetizer, I ordered the fettuccine carbonara, and my fianc√© got the frutti di mare linguini. Both were EXCELLENT. The carbonara was rich and creamy without being too heavy, with a good amount of parmesan cheese and ample, salty, savory hunks of bacon and pancetta. Most restaurants skimp out on those ingredients. Not Maurizio's. \\nThe frutti di mare was a hit with my fianc√© as well. It appeared to be loaded with seafood, and was very fresh and cleanly presented. We both left full, but not uncomfortably so (which is rare for North End pasta places), and will definitely be back again."},{"name":"49th Parallel Coffee","address":"2902 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The coffee is amazing!

And you've got to talk about it to somebody who understands that kind of food.\\"  It was ironic because as a 'thank you' to my host in the city I'd offered to take her along to the small restaurant on NE 30th Avenue and both the food and the restaurant definitely warranted discussion.\\n\\nConsidered by many to be the best restaurant in Rip City, Beast features a nightly six course seasonal menu for $75 - a veritable steal in fine dining - and with a small staff and seating for less than two dozen the feel of the restaurant is indeed quite intimate with the full kitchen on display and seats closely spaced, but not 'crowded' by any means.  Dark, wood, cement, and steel much like the majority of Portland restaurants the space is excellent and the service leaves little to be desired as it is efficient and attentive without being overbearing.\\n\\nFocusing on the food and the bulk of our conversation after the meal it should be noted than there was nothing wrong with anything that we tasted during our two hours at Beast and as a matter of fact, most of it was very good - the issue was the cooking, or relative lack thereof as nearly every course was simply assembled on the plate...a case of mise en place gone overboard, verging on assembly line food detrimental to both temperature and texture, and something I've never experienced before despite dining in many open kitchens and at a fair number of 'kitchen tables.'\\n\\nServed with great pacing and ample descriptions of each course, the salad and sorbet would prove to be fresh and light while cheeses were well culled; all a case of quality sourcing rather than preparation while the signature charcuterie plate was indeed quite nice - the two liver preparations particularly memorable and the boudin noir one of the more funky preparations I've had to date.  Less successful, the duck course clearly suffered from pre-preparation and arrived less crispy and less warm that desired; a shame as the flavor was good and the pairing of oranges and carrots was actually quite inspired in complimenting the fowl.  \\n\\nChoosing not to imbibe but tasting a bit of what was served to my fellow diner I have to say the wine pairings at Beast were all quite impressive; particularly the light Riesling served with the earthy sweet soup while coffee, a Columbian Single Origin roasted by Stumptown was perfect with dessert, a lightly whipped chocolate cream serving to smooth out the intensely sweet pears - a nice ending to a good meal, but certainly not the best meal in a city with so many fantastic restaurants where you can watch the culinary team hard at work preparing a much larger variety of interesting plates."},{"name":"Shilo Restaurant Portland Airport","address":"11707 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years.

They can even tell it's me when I call an order in based on what I order and that's without giving my name, lol! So it's stating the obvious when I say, I love Flats! The food is awesome and the prices are reasonable for downtown Atlanta. You can expect to spend about $7-8 for breakfast and maybe $9-12 during lunch. \\n\\nAnother reason to love Flats is because they serve breakfast all day! That's right, no need to rush to get breakfast before 10:30am, at Flats you can get it when you want it. They have breakfast flats on the menu, but just like the other flats you don't have to feel restricted to what's on the menu. You can add/subtract, do whatever to customize your flat to your liking. I love the Casablanca flat during lunch w/ the kale cole slaw. Keep in mind, I hate kale, but w/ the slaw, it's delicious! \\n\\nEasy way to save at Flats is to order a combo. Get a half a flat, choose any side, & get a drink for $8.99. Also, be sure to pick up a reward card & get it signed each visit. Fill up the card & get a free flat, score! \\n\\nThe only reason I can't fully commit to five stars is because the amount of time to prepare the food does seem to take a little while. It's not a long time, but it's not fast food either, so take that into account. You will enjoy your freshly prepared flat as soon as it's ready.

Located on Curry Road, I was at first a bit skeptical about the location, both while driving there and upon arrival. However, La Fiesta shows that those \\"hole in the wall\\" places really are worth checking out.\\n\\nThe venue is located in a random commercial building that isn't big enough to be called a strip mall. However, the restaurant itself is pretty sizable on the inside. The inside isn't really anything impressive, with just basic tables and a single neon sign advertising drinks. In fact, we arrived rather late (they apparently close at 9pm during the weekdays), so we only were given \\"To-go\\" menus at first. I was a little skeptical, but everyone was having a good time and had assured us the food was good, so I started looking at the real menu when it was brought over a few minutes later. The shrimp empanadas looked good and seemed relatively cheap, so I ordered that while my wife decided to order a taco salad.\\n\\nOur food came out about 10 minutes later (not bad for being late and serving an 8'ish person group). My shrimp empanadas were actually plated rather nicely. When I took a bite of them, I found out that they were also seasoned rather nicely and tasted quite good. I scarfed down my entire meal while chatting with everyone, and then headed out to play poker with a full and happy belly as the place was about to close. \\n\\nOverall, La Fiesta is the dictionary definition of a \\"hole in the wall\\" restaurant: it doesn't look like much from the outside or on the inside, but the food it delivers is well-priced and tasty.

Crab macaroni. Perfectly done asparagus. Crab claws the size of a toddler's hand in mounds before us. We did some damage but ultimately had to raise the white flag of defeat. \\n\\nThrough all of this insanity, the service was outstanding.

We don't have enough hatch around here. We decided to order meals instead since we waited long enough to decide. Nothing sounded appetizing. Chicken sandwich, roast beef sandwich, black bean sandwich, pulled pork. The burger was a plain one which I can make at home. Great for my son but not for us. I decided on the chicken and biscuit with honey. Growing up in MS and TX, I have a bit of an idea on how biscuits should taste. I ordered a side of the mashed potatoes. My husband got the plate with four chicken legs and ordered Cole slaw. He was disappointed that there wasn't an option for thighs or anything else for dark meat really. The waiter said, \\"Yeah sorry. I wish we had thighs too but we just don't have them\\". Four chicken legs for a person looking for dark meat isn't enough meat. My fried chicken breast was delicious. The honey and hot sauce was perfect. The biscuit? Though large, it was dry. It crumbled and completely fell apart because of the dryness. The mash potatoes were off. There was a strange flavor. I couldn't place it but couldn't eat anymore of it. Mashed potatoes are a favorite of mine. These aren't good. I tasted my husband's cole slaw. It's interesting. It nearly tasted off.

Preceded to put it down to help assist with the few orders that had just come in. Mind you this second cook is more experienced due to the fact that his hat was a different color. He didn't wash his hands but reached up to put on gloves and immediately jump on the grill. Now the grease trap is more than likely located next to the dumpster 8/10 times. Something to think about. \\n\\nLets continue. I used to work for waffle house.

So, perhaps our expectations, between our memories and experiences with competitors beers made us want more.  On this trip, the beers were very similar to one another.  We couldn't tell one cherry beer from the other, one one grape beer from the other.  If you can't tell the beers apart, what's the point of having more than one variety?  All the beers were subdued in their flavor profile and just not \\"all that\\".  In the past we visited another brewery in Austin which uses the same yeast in all their beers, and all their beers - regardless of style - have a very similar flavor profile.  We didn't like that other place, and we expected more from Jester King.\\n\\nWe had the pizza there two nights running, and their pizza was also lacking.  They recently switched flours and haven't gotten the crusts under control again.  The crusts were soft and floppy and the pizza's crusts just weren't all that flavorful.  If they were aiming for a New York Style pizza, they hit their mark, but that's not what I want in a pizza.  The toppings were also lacking - they just didn't make a real flavor statement.  I want pizza to be crisp, bold and daring, not flaccid and limp.  \\n\\nWe also had a pretzel, and that was an odd experience.  The bread product more closely resembled a hard roll covered with seeds served with a bowl of a dipping sauce.  It was OK, but not exciting and nothing about it really said \\"pretzel\\" to us.  Certainly not something worth going back for.\\n\\nWe still liked the venue, but overall the experience left us cold.\\n\\nThis is an edit of a glowing review left a few days ago and I feel like I should explain the drop from 5 to 2 stars in case you saw the previous review.

Sure, I've had good BBQ in Florida, but it's mostly been at chain restaurants like Longhorn, Duffy's or Sonny's BBQ. I love this place because there are only two of em around.  I'm grateful to my GF for taking me here.  \\n\\nWe tried a bunch of stuff.  First, we had to get the Brisket.  They have their own smokers out back and it tasted like it because they were perfectly moist and tender like they had just been taken off the heat.  The sweet and spicy bbq sauces that came with it were really good as well.  I prefer the spicy.  \\n\\nThen we tried the ribs, the pulled pork, and the oven roasted chicken.  All were phenomenal.  The ribs were my favorite.  Fall-off-the-bone goodness.  Smothered some bbq sauce on em and they were gone in 5 minutes.  The pulled pork was just as tasty.  Very similar to the brisket in terms of flavor and texture.  The chicken had a nice crispy skin to it too.  The butter chicken taco and the pork belly taco were really unique, if not a bit messy to eat.\\n\\nThe sides were nothing to sneeze at either.  The corn was surprising how good it was.  My girlfriend kept raving about it.  The cole slaw and beans were about average.  Nothing crazy about em.  The Yuca Fritas weren't all that amazing either.  Just sort of more-interesting French fries.  The sauce they came with was really tasty though.  Have no idea what it was, but it was a raspberry vinaigrette color and it was really interesting.  \\n\\nWhat did stand out were the Maduros.  These sweet plantains were coated with brown sugar and caramelized to perfection; so much so that they should be considered a dessert.  They were unbelievable.  I got two more orders just to take home and have later.  \\n\\nOverall, if you're craving bbq, this place is a must.  Everything felt like genuine southern comfort bbq and comfort food.

The leg was a joke, which is why this is 4 stars and not 5, it was the smallest leg I have ever seen in my life and was smaller than my usual chicken wings.

Not a super big deal, but she did send it back. Once the waitress brought it back sans mayo, it was also missing the cheese and about 50% of the french fries that were originally on the plate. Soon after, all four of us discovered that avocado used in our dishes was brown and possibly spoiled. As a result, I could only eat about half of my meal, and ended up with an upset stomach later in the day, from the nearly spoiled avocados no doubt. When you are paying close to $10 for a sandwich, shouldn't the ingredients be fresh? Toasted bread should NOT be burnt!\\n\\nTo be fair, when we brought the avocado issue up, one person in our party, the one who had half of her lunch taken away from the kitchen staff - did get her meal taken off the ticket, but I feel that the waitress could have asked the rest of us how our food quality was as well.

We arrived at around 7pm and there were only a few people seated at tables and a couple of people at the bar, it was quiet. The host seated us and we were greeted shortly after by a friendly young guy who introduced himself as our server. Throughout the night he did a great job taking care of us. They had a full bar so we tried the sangria and a cranberry mule, both were great. We decided to share a pit crew combo which consisted of 2 meats and 2 sides since we had a little bit to eat at the previous place. We tried the pulled pork, ribs, and for sides we decided to order the mashed sweet potato (excellent) and the collard greens (meh). Collard greens didn't taste very fresh and neither did the watermelon- It was oddly squishy and discolored.. We weren't bowled over by the sauces either, I'd like to think that they just weren't fresh because we really wanted to like them, but something just didn't taste right. I did however like the additional side of pimiento mac and cheese that I ordered. It was creamy and flavorful, not dry like I find at other BBQ spots. \\n\\nOverall, we had a mediocre experience but the service and drinks were great. I think that Andy Husbands, the award-winning chef and owner, would've been disappointed at the quality of the food we were served that night.

They also let you sample as many of the interesting flavors as you'd like before you make your decision. Mike and I tried all of their holiday flavors and liked them all except the fruitcake one, but that was only because there were bits of actual fruitcake in the ice cream and neither of us like fruitcake. We were both surprised to find that we didn't mind the mincemeat pie flavor! Afterwards, we sampled some of the regular flavors and I went with the pear with blue cheese and Mike chose the strawberry balsamic. The ice cream here is very soft and creamy and an absolute dream.

We've been trying plenty of Italian places all over town, but this is the first that reminded Jimmy of what he grew up on - dimly lit, big portions, classic flavors.\\n\\nWe called at 7:30 on a Friday night and got a reservation for 8:30.  We arrived around 8:20 and stood in the small and full bar area until our table was ready.  We got a cozy booth in the corner that the 3 of us just fit in, though the belly didn't have much room.\\n\\nService was very friendly and knowledgeable, as if the servers had been working there for ages.  It made me feel very at ease and welcome.  We were immediately brought some bread (in the form of warm, small Italian loaves) and bruschetta (small crisp rounds with the tomato topping), which I devoured.  \\n\\nWe started with the mussels - good sized portion, with lots of yummy tomato sauce, which required more bread to sop it all up.  The sauce was definitely on the savory salty side, which is a welcome treat as opposed to so many places that play up the sweetness of the tomato.\\n\\nI was going to get one of the veal dishes until I heard the specials: lamb osso bucco, grouper with a caper-tomato-olive sauce, and homemade spinach ravioli filled butternut squash, walnuts, and ricotta.  I debated the ravioli and the grouper, opting for the ravioli since the butternut squash sounded perfect for the fall nip in the air that finally arrived.  Jimmy ordered the veal gorgonzola, and Cam opted for the lasagna, since we'd seen several plates of the heaping, cheesy goodness going by as we waited for the table.\\n\\nEverything was delicious!  I personally would have preferred the veal in one of the other preparations, but the meat itself was thin, tender, and not overly breaded.  The lasagna was exactly what you dream of when you think of classic lasagna - perfectly savory meat sauce overflowing with cheesy goodness.  And the special ravioli was divine - the filling had great textured and well-balanced flavor, accentuated by the roasted asparagus on top.  Perhaps a little heavy on the cream for my usual taste, but perfect for the fall weather and my 8-month-pregnant taste buds.\\n\\nSadly, there was no room for dessert, but the cart with tiramisu, coconut cake, Bailey's cheesecake, flourless chocolate cake, and others looked divine.  Next time we will definitely start the meal with that coconut cake!\\n\\nMy only complaints: parking is a little tight, particularly in the lot on the north side of the building, where the spots aren't really marked anymore, and the prices are a little high to make this a regular dinner spot, though for the quality of food and atmosphere, definitely warranted."},{"name":"Firehouse Subs","address":"3309 E State Rd 436, Ste 1013","city":"Apopka","stars":"3","text":"A lot of people get turned off by the \\"Welcome to Firehouse\\" shouted when you walk through the door.

I'd been to Tasty 'n' Alder before multiple times, because it's too close for my own good, but I hadn't yet made it to Sons because I figured it couldn't be much different from Alder.\\n\\nBoy, was I wrong.\\n\\nSure, there are some consistent menu items (potato doughnuts, anyone?) but many of the items are different, and the whole place has a different vibe.

Though, I suppose you couldn't call a boudin blanc omelette \\"ordinary.\\"\\n\\nI despise eggs (I know, I'm weird--I chalk it up to traumatic childhood experiences) but I tasted the aforementioned sausage and it was GLORIOUS. The omelette also featured asparagus and a lovely cheese. My dad really enjoyed it.\\n\\nI got the steak and cornbread pancake, because I never turn down steak and pancakes, and it was HOLY MOTHER OF AMAZING. The cornbread wasn't really a pancake as it was a very soft, luxurious version of cornbread that gave way just a little when the perfectly cooked steak pieces were put on top of it. The cornbread was infused with green onions and was just the way I like it--slightly sweet, creamy, and delectable.

I'd suggest sticking with their chicken here.\\n\\nOverall, I was quite satisfied with Ole Wings and Tapas. A good choice among the Korean restaurants in this stretch if you want chicken and beer. Pitchers run at around $15 which is around the same as most restaurants, but I found that the value of the chicken was pretty good since we only needed to order one plate for the three of us. You also get free pickled daikon since it pairs well with spicy food.

The sign out front mentioned \\"Colored TV\\" & \\"AC\\". I chanelled my inner Myli Cyrus and thought \\"that's pretty cool\\", so I u-turned and pulled into the parking lot.

I'm innnnnnnnnn.\\n\\nI got lucky because it was Friday and they had fresh catfish with all the sides on special, set up buffet style at the bar. I got there early so I secured a spot at the bar and started on my twelve ounce appetizers. I had a Lite bottle or two before the bartender talked me into a Lone Star. I think they were on special or something but truth be told I had never had a Lone Star so I said \\"wth\\" and tried one. The beer is o.k. but there is a picture / word puzzle on every cap that is a bit of a mind tease. An example might be a picture of a bar + a picture of a chicken tender = bartender. Kinda fun, and makes you want to finish one bottle to get to the next quiz. p.s. for some reason they get harder to figure out as you drink more. Huh..............?\\n\\nBack to the food. Home made cole slaw, fresh catfish fillets, pinto beans, hush puppies, and bread if you are inclined. Everything was great, the bartender was attentive, and the cost was in line as well. All in all I was very happy to check in to the Hyatt and catch a good nap.\\n\\nSeveral solo visits later the wife and I were staying in Austin for a weekend and woke up a little fuzzy on a Sunday morning.  I was over served by a very aggressive bartender the night before and the better half was actually sick with a sinus infection. We walked in and again found a spot at the bar. We each had a bloody and I was fixin to order when Mama decided she was not hungry and thought we should just go back to the hotel and crash. Stud bartender over hears her and suggests she try the garlic soup as it is a cure all for whatever ails you. He described it as a a few hundred heads of garlic in a dark broth. Sounded a bit over the top to me but the wife went for it and boy was I glad she did. It's hard to explain but somehow it worked and was not overwhelming at all. I had something to eat as well, I think?, but all I can remember is that soup. Now every time she is sick she asks me to drive 160 miles one way to get her some of that soup. So far that hasn't happened.\\n\\nTo me it's a four and a half star and not a five because the place could be sooooo much cleaner. And the back patio overlooks Shoal Creek but they don't take the time to clean up the trash and brush that builds up leading to the creek so there is always litter in view.

When you first walk in you are submerged in an exquisite atmosphere of egyptian-esque architecture and design. The tables are candlelit and made out of granite.

We had to ask for them to bring out the complimentary bread. The appetizers were amazing (corn tamales and fried zucchini). While ordering we asked the waitress what she preferred between a couple different dishes and she wouldn't give us a straight answer. She just kept telling us what the dish was.  Not how good or bad it was. We waited for the food for about 10-15 min until only two of our plates arrived and the third member of our party had to wait about another 8 min until his food arrived. I had the chicken Parmesan \\"pizza style\\". It was basically a pizza except the dough was breaded chicken.  The flavor wasn't that great I probably wouldn't get it again.

I'll lay out the sequence of events and let the Yelp community be the judges.\\n\\nIt was 2am and I was starving. After driving to Rock City Pizza, which I did not realize was not open until 3, I had to make an alternative takeout decision fast. Remembering a past search on Yelp, I decide to try out Pizza Days. \\n\\nI pull up outside at 2:12am, walk to the door, and feel a sense of dread when I find it locked. Two of the staff see my at the door and give me the \\"we're closed\\" hand gesture by waving an open palm pointing towards the neck. \\n\\nI get back in my car and look at my phone to verify that both Google and Yelp, not to mention their own menu states clearly \\"open 'till 3 am\\". Fairly irritated,  I decide to call them and ask if they have changed the posted hours of operation? The woman who answered the phone could see me in my car with the phone to my ear, so she proceeds to ask me to hold in a rude tone. I watch from my car as she is venting her frustration to her co-worker that I dared call after she already gestured that they were closed a moment ago. \\n\\nA minute later, she takes me off hold and snarls \\"Pizza Days, yes\\". I politely ask her if they no longer close at the posted hours? She proceeds to explain that they do delivery until 3, but do not accept takeout orders that late. \\n\\nNow, let me clarify, she did not mean that they were just delivering the last orders of the night placed at earlier times. She meant that I could order delivery, however, and I quote, \\"it is illegal for you to pick up food directly at the restaurant\\". What???!!! \\n\\nI proceed to tell her that I would be willing to pay the delivery fee if it is a matter of money, I'm just starved and really would like to eat something. She once again refuses. Ok, now I'm simply confused?? I finally ask her \\"okay, so your saying I could order the food to be delivered? Can I just drive down the 20 feet down the street and have you delivery to my car? \\n\\nFor no earthly reason that I could understand, she out of nowhere changes her tone from irritated to pleasant and accommodating. She tells me that would work, takes my order politely, and tells me to drive to BonChon (literally two doors down). When I asked for the total price, she even offered to waive the delivery fee and honor the Yelp $5 off when spending $20+. \\n\\nFor that reason alone, I was about to give this place 2 stars, until as I was writing this, the delivery guy knocked on my window. I took the food, thanked him, and gave a little under 2 dollars as a tip. He recounts the money after watching me count it out right in front of his eyes and stares at me with a look of rage. I nicely ask, \\"I'm sorry, did I miscount how much I owed?\\" \\n\\nHe growls back at me, \\"have you never heard of tipping?\\" At this point, I lost my sh*t. \\"First off, I gave you like 2 bucks! Second, you want me to tip you for walking (without exaggeration) 15 feet from your restaurant to my car??!!! Not to mention, I wanted to pick the food up myself!! You are literally serving as an unneeded, unnecessary, unwanted third party to this short bus charade of what's supposed to be a very simple transaction!!\\" He mutters some profanity aimed at me and walks away. \\n\\nI feel stupider after dealing with this entire pizza enterprise tonight/this morning. I'm baffled at the absurdity of what has just transpired. \\n\\nDear Pizza Days, please bring in a few well qualified chimpanzees to replace the elementary school drops out you currently employ. Business will improve drastically. Based on this level of service,  I can only imagine what I have to look forward to eating when I get home.

We were greeted at the door by the Manager and he took us to the table (we really like going to No 9 but we don't like going there when this particular Manager is working because he doesn't care about making things right). Last time we complained about our chicken's temperature but he essentially told us too bad and did nothing about it. This time, we were quite hungry so instead of leaving back out the door when we saw that he was the only Manager on duty, we decided to stay and order the rice we went there for. When the rice plate was put on our table, it was immediately obvious to us that the portion looked unusually smaller than usual. I pointed it out to the waitress but she didn't understand what I meant so I wanted to complain to the manager but my friend told me what's the point because of the Manager on duty, and he's not going to do anything anyway to fix it. Take a look at the attached photo and you'll see the low quantity we experienced paying $18.63 plus tax for a very small portion of fried rice (also, the menu states $18.18 but we were charged $18.63 so you get less rice but pay more money). If the price is consistently $18.63 then the portion should be consistent too because loyal frequent customers like us know what the usual portion quantity looks like and we are wasting our money and getting cheated with small portion. In the photo we took, you can see the bottom of the plate from the left side and the right side so the cook didn't put the adequate proper portion on the plate this time. Why is it ok to get less than normal quantity fried rice?"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"1717 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Everyone comes for the biscuits but I loved the hash browns.

My girlfriend ordered a shrimp and steak burrito, which was big, but again, didn't have enough flavor. All in all, we were underwhelmed.

So I decided to take a chance and call for a takeout order from Victor's this Saturday evening. Based off the reviews, I had high hopes and they did not disappoint!! Can't believe I am just finding out about this cute little local, Italian restaurant, less then 15 minutes from my house. I almost didn't want to write a review because then more people will discover this hidden gem and I want to keep it all for myself! I'm selfish like that. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken Marsala dinner and the kids raviolis & meatballs. Both came with toasty garlic bread. Took 30 minutes to be done from the time I phoned in the order. Was ready to go when I got there and was still hot when I finally unpacked it back at the house 15 mins later. Victors is a small hole in the wall, corner quaint restaurant. It has only a few tables and chairs, so I don't recommend sitting in but that's all it truly needs! This is the place to call for amazing Italian takeout & it's perfect!\\n\\nThe containers looked small at first but believe me there is more food in them then you would think. My daughter and I ate our plates and had plenty of leftovers. So I brought the leftovers to my mother, who also had a full plate and then the following day (today) she gave me back the containers with just enough food left in them to fill my stomach again. \\nI am happily sitting here eating again and it still tastes just as good as it did 2 days ago!!Delissshhhh!

Five stars is simply a hard cast for me.  This place is more like four and a half stars for me, though.  I love this place.  It's great.  It's located where my beloved Kyoto Sushi was, and maybe it's the memories in addition to the anticipation of making new ones, but I really dig this dig!  The bar area has more of an open layout and the bartenders are very attentive (Jeff, specifically).  Talk about culinary creations. The food is on a slightly rotating menu, I have seen some things come and go, but for the most part they keep their best sellers.  I love places with rotating menus, but there is something to be said about going in somewhere and knowing exactly what you're going to get.  The GM is kickass and you know what else is kickass?  Their cocktail menu, well, moreso the cocktails on the cocktail menu, not the menu itself.  The antelope! The quail and cornbread! The chocolate six ways! The blistered shishito peppers!  The ONLY thing that I have to say and reason why I couldn't give SA five stars is because of the price.  The price itself was not what I'm addressing so much as how much food I'm getting for it.

My girlfriend and I have gone to every Indian restaurant in Austin and the only other place that comes close is the Northwest locastion of Bombay Bistro.  Those who say Tarka is better are simply deciding with their pocket and you cannot buy restaurant quality food for fast food prices.\\n\\nReasons we love Pakwan and feel it stands tall above its competition:\\n\\n1.)  Food - Murg Hara Barra, Gosht Biyrani, Dal, and chai were untouchable!!!!! I myself do not like chai the way it is traditionally prepared because it always tasstes too sweet and creamy with no spices or complexity.  This chai changed my mind and had me finishing my girlfriends drink.  The Murg Hara Barra was the first menu recommendation I received and a plate I have enjoyed many times (my girlfriends favorite).  The cilantro and fenugreek impart great flavors to perfectly cooked chicken.  The gosht biyrani is also great, if you like lamb and rice with a little bit of heat and complex supporting flavors of saffron and star anise then you have to try it.  Lastly, and my favorite, the Dal.  Its only on the dinner menu I believe, but its yelow lentils cooked up with spices and vegetables that were just delicious.  \\n\\n2.)  Service - Though we are not often people who go out for the service, the service at Pakwan has influenced us to come back more often.  I had lunch, and lunch service is not as attentive based on the nature of a buffet.  However, the first few times I came in I had my server/bartender choose my meal which is how I tried much of the menu already.  The staff has always been honest and stood behind items they truly believed in; I was even warned about consistency issues with certain dishes. \\n\\n3.)  Affordability - For the tarka lovers, come to Pakwan at lunch its $10.00 for all u can eat; and they could honestly run the buffet for much more its a true value!  At dinner, you do have to buck up to a normal dinner price.  I have never eaten a dinner entree at a restaurant that was well prepared for under $11.00 (aside from Mexican and Asian whole-in-the-wall establishments) and most of the dishes at Pakwan range from $12.00-16.00.  \\n\\n4.)  Bar Menu - I will be happier when they have Live Oak on tap or their Lagunitas IPA arrives, but no Indian restaurant I have been to has a very good beer selection.  Their mixed drinks are really cool, we tried a tamarind margarita that is rimmed with a spiced sugar that was great.  Other cocktails looked good too, but their wine list is one that could be recognized by wine spectator.  Few Austin restaurants outside of Perlas, Enoteca Vespaio, or Estancia Churrascarria can hold a candle to it (and those mentioned are substantially more expensive cuisine)."},{"name":"SanSai Japanese Grill","address":"539 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I come here very often for sushi, since they have happy hour all day everyday. The only thing that is really lacking with this restaurant is their customer service. Once you walk into the restaurant, they ask you how many are in our party and tell you to sit anywhere you'd like, which is sort of nice because it has a casual feel. \\nOnce you are seated, they will bring it menus and water. They will stop it off at your table without saying anything. No smiles, nothing. \\n\\nOverall, our food comes out rather quickly. It's always very delicious. But the thing that is a problem is that it takes forever to bring you a check. You usually have to go to the front counter to let them know that you're ready to pay."},{"name":"Azteca Mexican Grill","address":"3962 Powell Rd","city":"Powell","stars":"3.5","text":"Easily my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Columbus and the surrounding suburbs.

I want to say \\"enough said\\" and \\"can't say enough\\" at the same time.  Southern Thai fried chicken, curries and  roti are the specialties and thanks to their amazing combos you can have it all. The brisket curry was AMAZING! Huge chunks of beef swimming in spicy, milky curry full of fresh basil. Served with sticky rice, this was a fave. Caution: this one is spicy- not for the faint of heart.\\n\\nThe curries that come in the combos are heavy on the cumin, and the beef cheek so tender it melts on your fork on the way to your mouth. Roti is hot, crispy and made our eyes roll into the backs of our heads. Prices are shockingly reasonable. The spot itself is small and crowded and reminded us of eateries in Bangkok.

It's located at the far end of Pandora next door to the main Avatar gift shop. There is indoor and outdoor seating. You order at the counter, get your food, then sit down. However, we ordered our food on the Disney app and that puts you in a different line to wait for your food. I'd suggest ordering your food and then heading to the restaurant as it probably takes around ten minutes to be prepared and then it may be ready for you when you arrive. Highly suggest using the app to order your food early.\\n\\nThings I like: The food is amazing!! Very trendy and healthy dishes, which was so great to see for theme park food. Not the expected chicken fingers and burgers here! They have make your own bowl type dishes where you can choose your protein and base and they also have bao buns. Overall, a great healthy lunch option in the park! My dad got a chicken bowl with a salad base and I got the vegetable curry bao buns with a side of slaw and veggie chips. Everything was delicious!\\n\\nThings I didn't like: The food was all great, so no complaints there! However, during prime lunch hours you may have some trouble finding a table. But this wasn't a problem for us as we walked around a couple times and then found one and that was at around 12:30pm. So you just have to be a bit patient with finding a table.\\n\\nLOVED this lunch option in Animal Kingdom. This was the best lunch I've had in a theme park thus far.

According to Yelp PDX, eating in Stumptown means waiting. \\n\\nCount me stumped. Arrived at TnS 9:30 Wednesday morning flustered like the McCallisters from Home Alone:\\"We slept in!\\" Instead of a line to Seattle, Tasty is only 2/3 full. NO LINE!?\\n\\nWe grabbed counter seats and were treated immediately to glorious breakfast scents. Coffee followed three seconds later, and service stayed just as friendly and attentive throughout despite crowds and breakfast-rate turnover. I wish service was actually slower.. would drive customer's wild forcing them to breathe in all that delicious anticipation.\\n\\nThe counter also offers views of the cooks--a whirlwind symphony turning out eye-tease breakfasts helter-skelter. That's the second theme of Yelp PDX: \\"OMG, delicious.\\" Tasty delivered.\\n\\nMandatory chocolate donuts arrive piping hot, moist inside and crisp outside with a light dusting of sugar, the cream cutting it just slightly, and awesome texture interplay. Alongside Pip's Original as PDX's top donuts. Take that Blue Star.\\n\\nThe amazingly bitter radicchio salad is another must, chilled with tons of fatty cheese that adds texture as the acidic vinaigrette dances alongside. Rhubarb french toast is light and refreshing, cake-like with delicate cream. \\n\\nThe surprising disappointment was the Shakshuka. Yes, we added the merguez. No, the chef is correct in serving slightly undercooked eggs--they continue cooking in the sauce. The mistakes were too many peppers (detracts from richness) and needing more salt & pepper. Also.. TUNE UP THAT SPICE! The result was bland Shakshuka, the equivalent of over-gravied poutine. How's that happen? Found myself scanning the room for more delicious plates like when you're on a bad first date.\\n\\nMoral of eating in PDX: pick unpopular times.

I have been writing mostly positive reviews lately and I took some time to think of some places that I could write negatively about. Cheesecake Factory fits well into this category.\\n\\nThe only times I really came here were with my family, mostly when I was in high school. My sister loves this place, mainly for the desserts. She always wanted to go here for her birthday, and I, being the good brother, indulged her.\\n\\nThe wait is always bad. I always had a hard time understanding why people come here, and wait over an hour on weekends to come here. As I got older, I would meet my parents and sister here usually at least thirty minutes to an hour after they would say to meet because I am not a patient person when it comes to waiting.\\n\\nAfter the long wait, I found the food very mediocre. I am doing this from the memories of years ago, but I usually would order the burger. I remember it to be always overcooked. I am a big fan of the pink center (giggity?) and they just ALWAYS overcooked my burger.\\n\\nNow granted the name of the restaurant is not \\"The Burger Factory,\\" but I have never wanted dessert from this place, probably because I do not like cheesecake. Though I cannot tolerate lactose well, even growing up when my parents never believed that I had such a problem, I never liked cheesecake. I have come here with friends for a party or two as well for dessert, and I usually have a drink and that is it. I have no interest in purchasing their overpriced desserts.\\n\\nThis place is just way overpriced and it thinks it is better than it is like many places. I really cannot think of anything that is reasonably priced here except maybe the water.

No response was given by either.   I know this becase Jayson was taking my dinner order and stopped to do so.  Mark and his guest sat down at the bar and Mark began to speak, his guest did make requests and counters suggestions were made.  Marks retorts were/are not completely honest nor accurate.  That is not a fair assesment.  I will also add that he Mark interrupted Jayson's interaction with me, because I am a regular and very easy going I excused it.  I could see he had his hands full.  \\n\\nSecondly,  when you come to a bar and ask for a drink, cocktail and are adamant about what you are asking for, don't get upset when a skilled bartender repeats your order for clarification.  Mark asked for Ketol One, chilled and neat.  Well there is no such thing.  It is either chilled or it's neat, it cannot be both.  I know this because in a previous life I too have bartended I was a bit puzzled that someone that was being so rude would make such a point of being so wrong about something he apparently knew so little about.  \\n\\nLastly,  Zoe is a not only a member of management she is one of the owners and she makes sure that ever patron has a wonderful dining experience.  Before she went for the door she asked the bartender what happened, so that she would not have a have baked idea of what went on and could make and intelligent approach to resolution.  If given even half an opportunity I sure she would have made and found resolution.  Having read the comment but greater watched the exchange I actually have to yield to Holy Taco.

They indicated we could buy any of the selections at the restaurant (and more) at competitive retail pricing. \\n\\nEpicure is a perfect respite in Dripping Spring and well worth adding to your bookmark list to try."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My buddies and I were visiting Boston for a conference. We stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant. The dim sum was so very awesome. Very much like the one I had in Hong Kong. It is very reasonable.

The melted butter on it almost tastes like it's infused with pear. \\nIt's a seat-yourselves kind of place, at least for lunch. But they bring you your drink one you're seated and take your plate. Definitely a good lunch place if you're in the area."},{"name":"Moondogs","address":"3179 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Moondogs a couple times, and I'm pleasantly surprised (and maybe a little embarrassed) to admit that I actually kinda like this bar!  It's definitely not the type of place I would normally hang out at or make it a point to go to, but I haven't had a bad experience here!\\n\\nAlthough the parking situation sucks and you have to find street parking (unless you want to pay $10 to park in the lots, such as the Trader Joe's parking lot), at least I haven't ever had to pay a cover.  Maybe they never charge cover, which is cool, but I've only been there on Friday nights so I don't know for sure.\\n\\nThis is actually a good place to go with a large group because there is a variety of things you could do in the numerous rooms.  The karaoke machine is obviously very old and the songs probably aren't the most up to date, but a few of my friends and I have enjoyed singing karaoke - in front of people we don't know!  (Shocking for those of us who are used to singing in private noraebangs with only our friends!)  The bartender in the karaoke area is super friendly and makes yummy drinks.\\n\\nIn addition to the karaoke section, I have also participated in a few games of flip cup and beer pong.  However, I think it's super disgusting to play beer pong in a bar - using a mere cup of water to \\"rinse\\" your ping pong ball after it's fallen and rolled on the floor.  Yuck!  Don't wanna do THAT again...  I hate beer and suck at beer pong anyway, so no biggie.\\n\\nOverall, Moondogs gets 3.5 stars for being a chill bar with plenty of things to do aside from the usual drinking that you can do at any other bar.  It's a very casual place where you can be wearing flip flops and jeans, which is a nice change on occasion when you don't feel like dressing up.  Again, this isn't a place that I would go out of my way to visit, but I don't mind coming here every now and then with a group of friends.\\n\\n[Review 147 of 366]"},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I always leave here happy.

But the truth is they screwed up most of our orders and overcharged us for things we didn't order, then refused to correct it. The waitress got about half the drinks wrong for our party of 15, and most of us just had refills. Some people ordered the $5 special burrito and were given the 17$ version. We didn't think we'd gotten the wrong food until we got our bills and saw that we'd been charged three times more than what we'd ordered. The manager came and explained it wasn't the same thing, and didn't seem to care that WE TOLD THE WAITRESS WHAT WE WANTED and were brought the wrong thing and had no way to tell it wasn't the right thing. Apparently her mistakes were ours to pay for. \\n\\nWhen one of the party who'd been overcharged asked where on the menu the specials were, he was told they weren't, they were only listed upstairs on the board.\\n\\nThe best part? THE MANDATORY 16% TIP ON EVERY BILL. \\n\\nSo apparently this waitress, who honestly just couldn't remember anything we asked her for, deserved a decent tip along with our money supplementing her mistakes in our orders. Someone also had to pay for an extra order of food she brought down that no one asked for.\\n\\nUnbelievably shoddy service from incompetent server and crooked manager means every single person in our party will be telling everyone they've ever met to avoid this place. The food is good, but seriously, there are lots of places that have Mexican just as delicious and who won't overcharge you. I recommend Taqueria Playa Tropical in New West.

First impression, the grilled pork and shrimp vermicelli noodle looked very very nice. They gave me 2 skewers of pork and 1 skewer of shrimp. The meat was marinated very well and the fish sauce is very authentic! However, the portion is very authentic too haha it is like half the size of the regular American portion (maybe that's why they call it Vietnamese street food?!?), but for the price of $10 though, maybe not worth it when you can walk a few more blocks to Luc Lac for a cheaper, larger, as authentic but take longer Vietnamese food. \\nStill enjoy the marinated pork skewers here a lot though , plus it's so close to work and the food comes out faster, i might come back for more!"},{"name":"Little New Orleans Kitchen & Oyster Bar","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Very happy Little New Orleans opened this second location.

We loved it! Service was nice and food was yummy.  Husband had the fish entree (which is his usual choice when we eat out) and it was prepared perfectly -- not overcooked, slightly underdone and tasty.  I had the stuffed chicken with polenta.  That too was delicious. It was a toss up for me to choose between the chicken or the gnocchi w/oxtail ragu (I love oxtail!).  Reading the review of Cam T., I now know the gnocchi is what I will have the next time I visit.  Also, I second another reviewer's comment about the burnt sugar ice cream with the chocolate cake like dessert (I can't remember the name).  Again so yummy -- I love that taste of slightly burnt sugar -- caramelized goodness.

For mine, it was a slightly undercooked boneless chicken breast with a roasted red pepper, prosciutto, and  a wine sauce. OK, but just not quite right, and especially not for $16.00. Then, we opened the Pumpkin Tortellini just to see what they were like...and it literally smelled like the Catskill Game Farm. Ew, ew.

I ordered the #1 (fried chicken), #2 (beef cheeks) and #3 (marinated chicken thigh) Curry and Roti combos for 4 people to share. Luckily, the 4 of us were not big eaters because for $11-$13 per entree the portions are small. You get the same curry base in all the entrees, just a different piece of meat and a side of pickled vegetables. The meal itself is very unbalanced. There's no vegetables. The fried chicken was a bit dry though the outside skin was crunchy. The beef cheeks were the crowd favorite for being tender without dealing with any skin/bones. The chicken thigh was tender but the entree only came with 1 small thigh. Chicken thighs especially with skin/bone are one of the cheapest cuts of the chicken and this place won't give you more than 1 thigh. Don't trust the picture on the homepage of their website which shows a HUGE chicken thigh. Yours will not look anything like it. \\n\\nThe curry itself is tasty and went well with the roti but that piece of roti is not enough to mop up all the curry which is too salty to eat on it's own.

I can take a few steps if parking were in front, but there is only a spot for valet parking.  And I don't want to pay that in order to go pick up some guac and chips!  So...

This was last Tuesday around 2:00 or so and there were only a few customers.  No one came.  Finally, a server (I believe the only one that I could see) came over and said one of the large pillars had blocked her from seeing me.  As I have craved the pineapple guac since having it in Dublin, I placed a double order of that which included the bags of chips.  When she brought the order back and handed it to me along with the credit card receipt, she took off to other parts of the restaurant and never returned.  I signed it and waited to give it to her, but after a very long wait, just laid it down on the table next to the greeter's station and hoped she would find it.  What is worse is that the guacamole I got was NOT pineapple guacamole.  Not a bit of pineapple to be found.  Also, the extremely fresh chips I had at Dublin were stale at Polaris.

The atmosphere is inviting and wide open, softly lit and comfortable. The service was excellent, although the friendliness felt just slightly forced (fierce smiles). Here's what we had and how it rated:\\n\\nTwo Appetizers: The Smokey Chipotle BBQ Spare Ribs were tender, flavorful, and fall off the bone easy to eat. Perhaps they could have been a bit more spicy (more heat), but we loved them!\\nThe Crispy Tuna Springrolls were excellent too. One large roll was sliced in half on the diagonal. The wraps were light and crunchy, the tuna and greens inside were fresh, and the sauce complemented well. Very well executed.\\n\\nTwo Entrees: The FAROE ISLAND SALMON with Cous Cous, Lentils, Spinach, Carrot Miso Puree was okay. The salmon was cooked properly. Most of the flavor was in the skin, but that's fine. My dining companion enjoyed it, however the accompanying cous cous was undercooked and tasted of uncooked pasta.\\n\\nThe SKIRT STEAK with Frites, Peppercorn Jus, and Pickles was heinous. I believe skirt steak should not be on the menu if you aren't familiar with its characteristics and how to prepare it. I ordered mine cooked MEDIUM because I know skirt steak can be stringy. Preparing it rare can be disastrous. You can go medium rare if you marinate it and season it properly and then slice it with the grain into serving size pieces. Unfortunately, my skirt steak was prepared blood rare and served as one large piece plopped smack atop of a large pile of thinly sliced undercooked very brown potatoes (frites). I struggled cutting the stringy steak. It had a minimum of seasoning. After a bite or two, I lifted the steak off the pile of potatoes and put it aside to try the potatoes. (Why did they plate the steak on top of the potatoes anyway?) Trying to cut into a potato slice, my steak knife had a tougher time than with the steak. The potato was like leather. I was baffled. I chewed on a piece of potato. It was definitely undercooked and saturated in grease, which made it rubbery, REALLY rubbery. I do not exaggerate. I had to stop trying after poking a few more potatoes with my fork and knife and not being able to pierce them. What did they do to them?\\n\\nAfter the nice appetizers, my skirt steak plate was a sad let down. I didn't love the steak. I couldn't eat the potatoes. They transformed them into something that bore no resemblance to potatoes. There was no white potato flesh to be found. Thin, brown slices of rubbery ick. (Okay, I'll stop.) I shared my skirt steak with my dining companion, but it was slow work chewing on that. Our server stopped by soon after we were served and I pointed out that my steak was rare instead of medium, as I had ordered. She offered to take it back, but I declined because experience has taught me that sending back food is an exercise in futility. Restaurant food rarely comes back quickly, or improved, once you've sent it back. Besides, don't you worry they might get funky with it?\\n\\nAs our plates were being cleared, I explained my disappointment to a friendly bus person who promised to pass along my comments. Soon after, the concerned manager came and listened with great patience as I explained my dissatisfaction with my entree while at the same time heaping praise on the appetizers. The manager explained that the restaurant is new and the kitchen was just trying out the potato dish. She expressed genuine interest in my feedback about the skirt steak and the frites, and she made every effort to make us feel valued. She also offered to pay for my entree, which I felt was the right thing to do. It wouldn't be fair to ask me to pay $24 for what was served to me. Including our appetizers and sodas, our bill (with the one entree taken off) was about $75. We tipped well for the excellent service.\\n\\nI'll conclude by saying the vibe at this restaurant is very good. The food needs to follow suit in order to generate repeat business. Nothing should leave the kitchen that wouldn't delight a patron. I would not discourage anyone from trying Beat Hotel for dinner. (For now, just take a cue from what I ordered and hopefully you'll \\"skirt\\" any disappointment.)"},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place!

The new space is much improved in terms of more tables but could definitely do without the piano player in the corner.  It was way too loud for such an intimate place to necessitate a piano player.  We were seated immediately but had to wait a good 10 minutes before Larry, our waiter made an appearance and promised us water as soon as he was able.  He was clearly stretched beyond belief to try and serve 4-5 tables all at once.  And what struck us as odd was that the owner stood around not doing much when he, of all people, should have stepped in to help his poor wait staff.  Epicure could stand to hire bus help to clear tables, serve water, etc. wherever needed.   We happened to flag down some lady who brought us our drinks and ended up placing our food order with her, and \\"oh by the way, can we order another round of drinks with you while we have your attention?\\"  The food is quite good and reasonably priced for what you get but the menu seems to lack creativity, and seems they haven't changed the menu OR daily specials ever, if at all.  The final disappointing moment to end the meal tonight was having another waiter drop off the bill and not to include a pen in order to sign the bill!!!  This place has so much potential but needs to step up its game in terms of service, noise level, and diversity in the menu if it wants to survive in the restaurant business these days.

The lobster cocktail is available hot or cold; we chose hot. It was OUTSTANDING!!!! The drawn butter was so rich and complimented the fresh lobster. The oysters were PERFECTION. Probably some of the best oysters I've ever had. I don't know if I can eat oysters in Pittsburgh anymore after eating oysters in Salem. \\n\\nFor lunch, I settled on the seafood medley; which comes with scallops, schrod, and shrimp. It also includes coleslaw and your choice of side, and you also get to choose how you want your seafood prepared (fried or baked). I chose baked seafood, and for my side I chose broccoli. My entree was spectacular, the fish was very fresh. The coleslaw and broccoli hit the spot too. They also served a really great sauce with my fish, but I don't know what it's called. My family members loved their meals- they enjoyed the lobster bisque the most!! I tried a little bit and it was fantastic. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend Turner's if you want a 5-star worthy, top-notch lunch experience. The seafood is magnificent!!"},{"name":"Cafe Agora Midtown","address":"92 Peachtree Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This small Mediterranean grub hub will satisfy your inner Greek.

The wait was not long at all. Our entire party wasn't there yet, so most of us had to be there to be seated. \\n\\nOur server seemed quite rude and stand-off-ish. From the moment should spoke to us, she didn't seem so friendly. Weird because we're a friendly group haha. There were little things that bothered us about her, especially her serving etiquette. Our last person came late, and he literally had to stand even though we asked for a chair the moment we sat down. He went to the bathroom and came back, and we still didn't have a chair yet. We ended up having to flag down a hostess to bring us a chair. If you requested anything from her, she would walk away without saying a word. We received our appetizers but no plates, so we had to flag someone else down for plates. Then for dessert, I asked for plates with forks and she gave me just plates. \\n\\nI ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi. The portion of steak is very small, but the portion of shrimp and mashed potatoes is plenty. The shrimp scampi is not what I'm accustomed to. I assumed it would be saut√©ed shrimp in a butter and garlic sauce, but it was breaded shrimp in a creamy sauce. Not a fan. \\n\\nI haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in awhile, so I remember the slices of cheesecake being humongous, but I guess they're a lot smaller now. Still tastes good though.\\n\\nFor appetizers, if you like buffalo chicken, then I highly recommend the Buffalo Blasts. Its shredded buffalo chicken with cheese then deep fried. It's a huge portion! About 6 large triangular pieces served with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"There's much to like about the Beat Hotel, unfortunately there are also things that makes one take pause.\\n\\nFirstly, it's a great space (used to be the old Tannery). For those of you who like to eat at the bar, you'll be happy to find two of longest bars I've ever seen. Their food is quite good. We started with the Butcher's Platter and my signature dish Earth Bowl were both delicious. I also really liked the Petite Sirah there. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the service was a little sketchy at times. As I was waiting for my friends, I got a drink at the bar. When I asked for a wine taste, because I couldn't decide between two wines, the bartender curtly told me, \\"We don't give out free samples here\\" (wrong choice of words, me thinks).\\n\\nFrom there I was obviously paying attention. The primary server of our table was excellent, she was friendly, attentive and efficient, but some of the other supporting staff could've been better. Like the one bringing drinks to people who already had drinks and ignoring those who did not. Or another staff who spilled water on our table only to bring a towel so we could clean it ourselves.

The owner is on-site and super friendly.  A pounder of Old Style is delivered post haste. Life can be good at family joints. \\n\\nBeyond the homey, cozy atmosphere, the biggest surprise was the pizza itself.  Strikingly good for what I consider a town bereft of really good pizza.  The crust is nice and thin, the sauce has a hint of spiciness to it, and the toppings are well portioned.  All in all, a very solid slice, and one you can tell is made with love. \\n\\nThis little joint is definitely no frills, but that's what's so great about the place.  I really did feel like I was sitting in someone's kitchen, and that I was more than welcome to stay as long as I wanted.  \\n\\nGreat place for a family get together or to watch a Blazer game and have a slice.

Tomato salad isn't salad - it's just dressing marinated tomatoes. Caramelized onions, peppers (hot), corns and Italian parsley were very flavorful. Nice and hearty dish, yet it might be too light. OK. \\n\\nShakshuka: Red pepper & tomato stew with baked eggs & merguez sausage. Sausage had tons of spiciness.

If I have to be critical, I think there's sometimes a little too much filling in their fruit-based tarts. The filling to dough ratio seems like a 70:30, though I'd like more of a 50:50 ratio. My favorite pastries here by far are their croissants, especially their Croissant aux Amandes (croissant with an almond cream filling).

I do want to note that she did offer us waters while we wait before she went back to her conversation. Bottom line when we got home and ate the ribs they were out of this world. So good. Can't even describe how much I recommend you try this little gem in revere that has no good food places . Note to self: do Uber eats , I rather tip a driver than go do take out.

I highly recommend asking for him. The espresso martini was so good that my mom and I both decided to order one. We actually ran into Ramsey before entering and we asked if that was him and he said yes. The restaurant was in the middle of hosting a baby or wedding shower and everyone was dressed really nicely and he assured us that we could still come in and sit at the bar just the way we already were dressed.

For that reason, I won't go into everything I ate, just things that stood out. \\nThe lean pork and preserved egg congee was a good size to share between two people. It also had good flavor in the rice and meat. My only wish is that it contained more meat/egg/fillings. I feel like eating it felt empty at times. \\nThe shrimp dumpling was good. It came to the table looking kinda gray and not the usual pink color I'm used to seeing. This threw me off at first, but once I bit into it everything was fine.\\nTIP: if you're ever at a dim sum place and you see egg yolk custard steamed bun I HIGHLY recommend trying it!! It's my favorite dim sum dessert. It is a soft, steamed bun filled with creamy, sweet custard lava that makes you feel warm inside.  \\n\\nOverall, if you're looking for dim sum in Boston, this is a good place to go. If you're looking for dim sum that's unique and different from experiences you've had in the past, maybe try elsewhere."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Tu y Yo?

Therefore, I will preface with, this is probably not a good place to bring groups. In fact, Las Palmeras seems like your neighborhood restaurant/bar that I bet many local Hondurans visit. They probably were not prepared for our size (20+), having to call in reinforcement, despite Daniel B. having made a reservation.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located right off Shallowford in a pretty random shopping complex. The inside is surprisingly large, with a bar area, slot machines, and also an entire back room with a pool table and a pretty large dance floor.\\n\\nThey arranged us Last Supper style and the wait began. The presumed owner came out and took our orders... Drink orders. We asked if we could order food and he said no. I assume he wanted to do things systematically and wasn't anticipating everyone only wanting water. \\n\\nIt was another 20 minutes before we were waited on and then asked to order. Most people ordered the traditional Honduran breakfast (chorizo) or dinner (skirt steak). I unfortunately fell prey to \\"avocado\\" and also ordered one of these plates. It was probably the least appetizing thing that I tasted that meal, but more on that later.\\n\\nTo tide us over, they brought out tortilla chips with a crumbly, white cheese (similar in appearance and taste to feta), and it had a vinegary sauce on top. I wasn't a fan but many at the table enjoyed it.\\n\\n50 minutes and a pack of (grandma) saltines later...\\n\\nOur food arrived! Pamela C. was not impressed with the baleadas or her tajadas con pollo. I think this is similar to any Chinese/Korean/Indian/etc thinking the homemade stuff is better, or restaurant grade just not living up to \\"how mom makes it.\\" /shrug \\n\\nI thought the baleadas were pretty tasty. The baleadas are basically Honduran tacos with a thicker flour shell and eggs/steak/avocado any or a combination of them all, with refried beans and cheese. The tajadas con pollo was a dish with crispy fried chicken on a bed of plantain chips with lettuce and chimol (similar to pico de gallo). This also had the weird vinegar sauce so I didn't even bother trying it. \\n\\nI would say besides the baleadas, I really liked Praveen'a beef soup. It's reminiscent of a Chinese beef stew with similar flavors. I was one of the last ones to receive my food. It was surprisingly warm, but I honestly wasn't impressed. - crumbled scrambled eggs, rubbery steak, random side of cheese, and some rice. I'd pass on this next time. I think the maduros would have made this a tastier option but alas they ran out and offered us the salty plantain chips in exchange. (They were good, but I didn't think it paired well with the dish, nor was it what I was looking for)\\n\\nThere were a couple of flukes on orders but all in all, most seemed content with their food. I will probably have to come back with a smaller party and try something else. I haven't given up on you yet, Las Palmeras!!\\n\\nTLDR; get the baleadas, skip the traditional meal.

It is hands down the best breakfast in Portland.  Reading a couple of these sub-par reviews makes me cranky, because these people obviously just don't get it.  \\"It\\" is only the little things this cute neighborhood restaurant does to set itself apart from other breakfast cafes.  Let me list a few:\\n1. The adorable breakfasty amuse bouche they bring you when you are seated, typically a dollhouse sized version of one of their amazing house-made pastries or scones.\\n2. The attentive and professional staff.  They not only serve you promptly once you are seated, but they also know their menu!!!  It seems rare these days to find a server at a restaurant who knows how things are prepared and what the specials are (and if they are still available).\\n3. The awesome menu!  If you MUST have a choice of \\"two eggs, any way you want them with two sausage links, 2 bacon strips, fruit cup and a pancake,\\" you don't deserve to eat at Toast.  It is evident they put a lot of care into creating menu items that are full meals with several exciting components that work together and are interesting.  Plus, all of their menu items have cute names like \\"dismal times,\\" and \\"hippies use the front door.\\"  \\n4. The eggs.  Every egg I have ever been served has been PERFECT.  As a person who has gone through culinary school and suffered through \\"egg cookery,\\" cooking a perfect egg is not as easy as you think.  Pan too hot=brown lacing on fried eggs.  Water not hot enough=loose, watery poached eggs.  The do eggs right.  The fried eggs are perfectly white with oozy yolks (unless you want them less oozy), and the poached eggs are beautiful.  \\n5. They use local produce and buy responsibly raised meat.\\n6. Stumptown coffee: gimmee.\\n7. Awesome breakfast cocktails.  Not only can I get a mimosa made with blood orange juice, but I can get it in a pint glass for 2 dollars more!!!\\n8. Awesome specials.  One visit, my husband had a lovely braised lamb dish with root veggies and poached eggs...another time it was pork belly...need I say more?\\n9. Dismal times!  Slice of thick toast, Grass fed ground beef sauteed with onion and dripping with super sharp white cheddar, perfectly poached egg, fresh peppery arugula on top...I order this when they have it on the menu about 50-75% of the time...it is delicious.\\n10. Finally...the best part:  the SPACE HAM!!!  In my experience, eating nitrite free meats sucks...the meat isn't salty enough and is never the right color.  I mean, I do it because nitrites are bad for you, and I like fads, but when I first ordered the breakfast sandwich they do at toast (Not the bad-ass breakfast sando, the other one) with the nitrite free ham and mornay sauce, I literally almost died...of happiness.  The ham was so amazing, I knew it was of another world...hence: space ham.  And the mornay sauce: shut up!\\n\\nYes, I know the wait can be long on the weekends, but people!  It's Portland.  Breakfast.  Weekend.  You'd be waiting at any breakfast place, including the crappy ones too.

Although I definitely did jump into the mosh pit, it seemed like even those who were further back had a good view of the bands that played that night.  With a venue this small, I was actually somewhat surprised that I was subject to a more-than-cursory pat-down by security.  It wasn't invasive and it was over pretty quick.  I suppose that's the legacy of being the venue where Dimebag Darrell of Pantera was shot and killed in December 2004.\\n\\nI rated this venue with three stars primarily because it was ill-prepared for me as a customer.  My biggest disappointment was that there was no easy way for me to get money to buy drinks at the bar.  The ATM machine in the venue was out of order.  I was informed that the nearest ATM was at a gas station rather far away.  Also, I was informed that I was not allowed re-entry (I had left some cash in my car).  Thus, all I can conclude is that the venue absolutely did not want to make any extra money that night.  That seems like the only reasonable explanation and it's their loss, not mine.\\n\\nI definitely enjoyed the show and was impressed that the venue was able to get a band like Taproot to play there.  I'll also note, here, that Taproot made some extra money off of me as they came equipped with a Square reader and my friend had his debit card with him.  I found it rather amusing that the band was more prepared for customers than the venue.

There is a flight of stairs right in front of the entrance where you will find a patio-like area on your left and the main dining hall in front. For a Monday night, it was quite crowded with patrons, but we were able to snag seats at the bar. However, this isn't a tiny bar where people just enjoy drinks. The tabletop is roomy with more than enough space to comfortably dine.\\n\\nOur waitress was an incredibly sweet person who checked on us often and recommended us to eat family style since the portions at Tasty n Sons are larger. Armed with that knowledge, we ordered the Slider Board, a combination board of their three sliders, Tynan mac and cheese, cajun mac and cheese, and their house fries.\\n\\nEach dish came out separately, allowing us to focus on one before the next one was served. Our first dish was the original Tynan mac and cheese that oozed with gooey cheese without tasting slimy or pasty. The pasta noodles weren't overly mushy and the layer of bread crumbs on top added great texture. The house fries came next and while they were fried well, they didn't taste special. We did, however, enjoy the sauce that tasted like a fancy mayonnaise.\\n\\nThe Slider Board looked awesome with three tiny slider of burgers. Our favorite was the battered cod, served with an aioli sauce and fresh chives. The fish was surrounded by the crispiest batter and tasted incredibly tender. The second favorite was the fried chicken that packed a good kick of heat, which was quickly soothed by the sweet pickles. The beef burger reminded us a lot of In N Out, but in the best way possible in that it tasted comforting and familiar. \\n\\nFinally, we got the cajun mac and cheese that was topped off with sweet sausage that added not only texture, but also a sweet undertone that cut through all of the spices and the heavy cheese. It was the perfect addition to a mouth watering dish.\\n\\nTasty N Sons absolutely exceeded our expectations. We loved the family style way of dining, allowing us to try a variety of items without breaking the bank (or our stomachs)."},{"name":"Jinx","address":"3000 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Super nice aesthetics, extremely nice staff, killer music selection, and drinks are on point.

But we had to go to support our buddy who was visiting Portland, similar to my group of friends and I. \\n\\nThe interior design of Beast is ok, with only three tables, and a seatting capacity for about 25+ people. Thus, they only have very specific intervals of time to choose from, thus making a reservation can be difficult. The ambiance is romantic, with dark/black walls with cool quotes, and even a drawing of a pig! \\n\\nIt is a set menu, and changes each day. It includes 6 courses, including dessert with a coffee as well. \\n\\nOn the night my friends and I went, our 6 courses included: Hokkaido Scallop crudo with Taro-beetroot chips, a Charcutterie, Petit Sale, Watercress-Grapefruit & Radish salad, a Selection of Artisanal cheeses, and for dessert it was a Brown sugar spiced buttermilk tart with a orange-cranberry sherbet. \\n\\nOverall, the each course was either a hit or a miss. One of the dishes that surprised me the most was the Hokkaido Scallops because the taro-beetroot chips really complimented the scallops really well, and gave it a delicious sweet and salty flavor. Most of the charcutterie was either ok or just bland. The best was the short rib croquette, veal loin, and chicken liver mousse on a leaf lard cracker. Finally, the dessert they had that night was expetional, and thus it definitely made it up for the small portioned meals and \\"bougie\\" style vibe we experienced.\\n\\nWe decied to to share a bottle of a French red wine ($56) among the four people in my group, instead of their wine pairing per course option ($48 extra per person). If you know your wine and your on a budget, then I would recommend you share a bottle of wine versus letting the people of Beast decide for you. It's another \\"bougie\\"/ pretentious trick they use for you to pay more, haha. \\n\\nThe service was expetionally friendly, and I liked that they explained us each course for us bedore we ate each one. Thus, if you are a foodie like me, this is a great place to check out! However, I didn't like the \\"bougie\\"/ pretentious vibe here, the portion were small, and I really felt I could get better food at another restaurant similar to Beast. \\n\\nIt's a place to try once, even if you are a local.

It was a big wind for us. \\n\\nNow, we didn't go every day, but those special bi-weekly visits are the kind of things that businesses dream of.

The interior, once a bastion of old-world 1950s/60s/70s paneling and plaid trim, is now sleek and modern with a minimalist take on the farmstead motif. \\n\\nTo me, however, in contrast to others' experiences have seen no drop in the quality of food or service.

Perhaps I just ordered the wrong item. But before I get into the food, I'll get into the wait time for our food. This is a small place where you order at the cash register and they'll give you a number and bring out the food once ready. After ten minutes of waiting in line looking at the menu, we were prepared to order when it was our turn. Once we sat at our table, we waited about 25-30 minutes for our food. We were all hungry and getting pretty restless. I noticed that the numbers they gave us didn't seem to do much good because one particular waiter was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, not knowing which dish went to which table. I had gone up to get a refill and noticed a bunch of prepared dishes just sitting there looking for a home and a bunch of people standing around not doing much. Crossed my fingers that those were our plates!  Well after much waiting, we eventually got our food. \\n\\nI opted for their signature sandwich, the \\"Big Floyd\\" - brisket, pulled pork, sausage, sweet BBQ sauce, citrus peanut slaw, and French fries served on a toasted coconut pineapple roll. Man! that sounds so much better than it actually was.  It was just a hodgepodge of various flavors that I don't think complemented each other well. Individually, not a problem but together, it wasn't all that great.  It was hard to taste the flavors of the meat with everything else that the sandwich had in it. It was the toasted coconut pineapple roll that really sold me on getting this sandwich but unfortunately, it is just too ambitious of a sandwich and the roll was overkill. Perhaps Hawaiian Sweet Bread would make a better sandwich where they can still maintain the sweetness and uniqueness. Just a thought.  I also got fried plantains as a side and they were perfect.\\n\\nThe 1/2 chicken with 2 sides combo ($10) seemed to be a hit with the others. One got rice and grilled corn on the cob (with chili powder, lime and cotija cheese) which she loved. The portions were very substantial. The half chicken is huge; could've been enough for lunch and dinner. If I were to go back again, I'd probably choose something off the meat platter menu instead of a sandwich.

It is handmade ice cream that is local, organic, and fresh. I understand the LA location will also be partnering w/ local farmers and others to concoct some exclusive offerings representing CA.\\n\\nMy fave local flavors are their Pear w/ Blue Cheese and Cinnamon Snickerdoodle, holy shiite! Seasonal flavors I'd recommend include Goat Cheese Marionberry Habanero, Birthday Cakes & Blackberries, and the \\"Carrot Carrot Cake.\\" Ok, just listing those makes me want to hop on a plane back to Portland!\\n\\nFor the most part, I feel the ice cream is that \\"good\\" to the point it can never satisfy you as you want more! I've had a scoop in a cone and in a bowl (on the same occasion) in order to try to vary up what I try. If you want multiple flavors and aren't content with some free samples, then buy an ice cream \\"flight\\" (see pic) which gives you 4 scoops for $9. That's probably best for your first visit. \\n\\nAfter you've experienced enough of their flavors, skip the line on a future visit and head straight inside to buy a pint of one of your faves that's already stored in their freezers.

We did have 3 different people come over to us in the span of 3 minutes though - which while nice, bordered on being almost disorganized. \\nAs others have said, the salsa and chips that arrived on the table was ridiculously small. The amount of salsa ( if you can call it salsa, I'll get into that later) was no kidding about 3 mm deep in the bowl. There was so little that it was quite ridiculous. When the server asked if everything was  ok I  told her there was almost no salsa and showed her the bowl she agreed and brought another with a little more, again hardly any in the bowl. An additional bowl of chips and salsa apparently is $1.50. Seriously? Just don't serve them, or factor in the food costs into something else and do it right. Terrible first impression. \\n\\nThe salsa was the same red sauce that they used on the enchilada plate which I ordered( I was told  this by the server). When eating it, it had a familiar distinct flavour. I'm not suggesting by any stretch of the imagination that it was this, but it tasted like Campbell's Tomato soup concentrate.   Smooth, no chunks, strange flavour and a pur√©e quite unsatisfying and a bad way to start the meal.\\nI ordered A veggie enchilada, which came with refried beans and rice. The food arrived quickly, but the vegetables were undercooked, and the flour tortillas were rubbery. \\nThe portion sizes for this meal where what I would've expected which was good, but the food was not great, and I definitely wouldn't return. The service was definitely pleasant but I suspect that they do the bulk of their business from tourists. \\nThe most memorable part of the evening was when the server asked me if I would return them, and I said I don't think so.

I called megabyte to complain and the best they could do after a $90 order was say \\"sorry we used a third-party driver so it's not our fault\\". Of course I decide to never order with them again given the numerous amounts of pizza locations in the downtown area. \\n\\nJust this last Sunday my wife went to order pizza and having forgot that we will not do business with megabyte, she orders from them. While the order arrived on time, once again I receive a pizza that is nearly folded in half. I was too angry to call them at that moment so I decided to give them a call the next day. \\nI spoke to someone who said my manager is currently not in and I will have him call you when he returns. 4 days ater no call. I decided to call back again and spoke to someone named Mary. Mary decided to give me the same answer about a manager not being in and the fact that they use a third-party driver. I said that is no excuse, I order from megabyte so regardless of who brings it here, my money went in megabytes pocket. Once again Mary stated the best she can do is speak with her manager and call me back. Surprisingly she called back within five minutes and Lord behold, her statement to me was \\"my manager said why did you wait a day to call us and not right away\\". I said while I understand why you expect me to call back right away, I had no need to for two reasons, one I was livid and not going to talk to someone in that condition and b, calling right away just alludes to the notion that I want a pizza replaced right away, which I didn't since I had no desire to wait another 45 minutes to eat. I explain to Mary that this comment of hers was a irrelevant and that her manager was a very poor one if this is how he deals with customer complains considering you guys ignored my original call and never called me back. She seemed to take offense that I thought her manager was not a smart one, and left it at that and essentially expected me to hang up, which I did. Im assuming family ran business so her manager is probably her family member and hence why she was offended.\\nIt is now very clear to me why this specific location has such a high turnover in management. Literally someone new owning the store every 6 months. Megabyte, the cost of each of your pizza to you is under six dollars, it's not worth losing a customer and having me spread this negative experience with you to all your potential future customers, that's just poor business on your behalf.\\n\\nSorry for the typos, review done with speech to text ."},{"name":"Shilo Restaurant Portland Airport","address":"11707 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We come manly for the salad bar.  \\nThe have a top of the line salad bar.  \\nAnd very excellent clam chowder."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Decent ice cream, but overhyped and overcrowded.

In fact I would say like shake and bake mom used to make bland. These things should have been much better they are deep fried. The sauces really did nothing I tried 3 including donkey. The fries were basically milk battered with seasoning. The seasoning was a lot like greek fry seasoning which I hate.\\nThe chicken itself should be a winner all by itself. They appear to depend on sauces that for the three I got werent additive to the overall taste. \\n\\nThis is my second shot at Guys food the first being Planet Hollywood which was also a fail. I watch his diner/dive show and he doesnt appear to have brought any of that experience into this.\\n\\nNot sure why Disney Springs cant find something decent besides Earl of sandwich?  There are other good ones,   but things like chicken guys, pizza, planet, rainforest, the irish chicken place with all fried foods, are not good.

A few times in the past when I have ordered a martini, it has come in a standard large martini glass. However on the last two occasions that I visited, my drink came came in a smaller, short martini glass with no stem (for the same $9.50 mind you).

Like most, they have suffered over the years with maintaining staff which could explain some of the service inconsistencies in the comments.  I think the only thing keeping this place out of the mainstream convo of go-to Mexican in Boston is that there are some inconsistencies in execution of certain dishes (some are always great, some can be hit and miss) as they do some experimentation with the menu.

Typical entree is in the $10-16 range and is a pretty generous serving.   \\n\\nFood is wonderful and I cannot recommend the Scallops Nantucket enough.

I took that as an opportunity to go exploring on Yelp. I came across Southern Kin Cookhouse, checked out the menu, and bookmarked it. Two weeks ago, we decided to trek to Assembly to try it out!\\n\\nThis establishment is super spacious with an industrial/hip vibe to it. I really adored the large ceiling fans and lights that dangled above. The table set up and the plates were all so CUTE! Given the vastness of the space, we were seated in no time. Our waiter was nice and friendly and checked in on us from time to time but wasn't overly hover-y either. The rest of the staff seemed upbeat, too. Halfway into our meal, the manager(?) made his way around the tables to check in with everyone, which was nice!\\n\\nWe had the Farmhouse buttermilk biscuits to start because I read some reviews on them beforehand and the general reception seemed to be good! It came with a side of honey butter and jam- and both were delicious!! The honey butter was my favorite out of the two- it was so unique. The biscuits were a bit too dry for me, though, and I grew tired of it rather quickly. I don't think I'd recommend it. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bayou tacos because he was really set on trying gator meat and he liked them! He said the meat tasted like a cross between chicken and fish. His meal also came with a side of white cheddar grits and they were so yummy! The cheesiness wasn't overpowering but it was definitely prominent. The balance they managed to achieve was truly commendable!! I had the egg biscuit sandwich (which came with a fried egg and bacon strips) and home fries. The biscuit they used for this dish had a smoky kind of taste to it. I liked it better than the Farmhouse buttermilk ones, but again, the biscuits, in general, just didn't do it for me here. The highlight of the meal was probably the home fries. They were crispy and packed with flavor on the outside and soft on the inside. :- ) \\n\\nOverall, our meals were good and a little pricy, but not very memorable.

My name is Anna. My husband Tony and I are the owners of Rino's Place. Me, being the owner has options in responding to you. 1- I could do it publicly or in a personal message, and 2-  I have the option of deleting bad comments pertaining to my business. I never respond to yelpers,  because everyone has a mind of its own and opinion! As you can see I chose to reply to your comment publicly, and I also chose to leave your message in the feed. \\n\\nI would typically start with responding to anyone with concerns to my business with \\" I'm sorry\\", but in this case I will not. Am I suppose to apologize for the wait? Obviously the wait means something. To mention another restaurant on my page is complete disrespectful and ignorant. The owners of Off The Boat are very good friends with my husband and I. They have a wonderful establishment, and serve great food as do we. As far as us being cocky about our fame on the Food Network, the show aired 3 years ago and in my eyes it's old. We never got cocky first of all! What the Food Network did for us was make our business grow even more then what we already had. We were always a busy restaurant! And if your not aware of that ask around as it seems that we \\" Rino's Place\\" is the topic of your daily conversation! We opened Prima e Dopo 2 years ago. It's merely an option for people to wait and be warm, have a drink, etc! No one is forced to wait there. \\n\\nI know my staff is far from perfect! In my eyes customer service is number one. When I do get complaints about anything pertaining to my restaurant rather it be the food, service or wait... I, as the owner take it very seriously! \\n\\nI will complete my response  to you with........ As for you throwing us down because of the wait is typical and I hear it all the time. Unfortunately that is out of our control. We are a small establishment, that seats 46 people at a time. Our food is cooked to order using the highest quality possible. I will end this with you stating that \\"maybe\\" you would give us another try, honestly speaking we don't need, nor  want people like you!

Was greeted upon entry by a seated teen yelling \\"Welcome to Yogurt Breeze\\", but her uniform stated that she worked at Dominos.   Ok, no biggie.. we were all teens once.   The three teenage males working were more interested in talking to the Dominos girl and joking around.  Things got a little \\"cray cray\\" when a very off color rap song started to play...  2 out of 3 teens are screaming \\"Turn the channel, turn the channel!!\\" And the remaining teen is screaming \\"I'm trying\\", as the Dominos girl cackled uncontrollably. (I found this whole Keystone Cop act very funny!)  After this, the teen workers came out with a slightly different attitude, with 2 cleaning and 1 actually helping us at the counter.   Usual array of yogurt flavors and dry & wet toppings and syrups.  One bonus this shop has is the nitrogen ice cream.  You start with a vanilla ice cream base, then you get to choose 3 mix-ins.  Very cool to watch as the counter person freezes your mixture with liquid nitrogen.  The resulting ice cream is *very* hard and difficult to eat!  Make sure to take some time to let it soften up!\\n\\nDecent yogurt, trendy ice cream gimmick, but less than stellar ambiance.

Our experience was awful.  My wife had the monkfish and it was overcooked and dry.  I had the scallops which were under-cooked - almost raw - very similar to the appetizer, scallops tartar which was OK.  WE arrived at 7:00 PM.  There were a number of open tables - in fact far too many for a supposedly top rated seafood restaurant in the Back Bay.  The servers seemed to be congregated in one area - away from where my wife and I were seated all talking since there seemed to be nothing for them to do.  Interesting!  Finally a server came over about 15 minutes of just waiting and took our order.  We received the restaurant's celebration champagne and we ordered a glass of wine.   Then we waited - and waited and waited. Fully 20 minutes passed before our appetizer arrived.  The appetizer dishes were finally taken away 10 minutes \\"after\\" we finished the course.  Then we waited - and waited again.  After waiting 25 minutes for our entree course to be served, we finally stopped a server and had to ask where our entree was?  The answer was, \\"I'll check on it\\".  Our food finally arrived 5 minutes later.  At that point, we decided that was \\"enough\\" of an anniversary dinner experience and left.

I'm a petite girl who usually only eats about half of a restaurant meal because I get full easily. At Flower Child, I ate my entire meal and was still hungry. Not a single person at my table was satisfied because their meals were so small. The food is also pretty bland/nothing special.

We ordered a pit boss with pulled pork, hot links, and burnt ends, along with mac & cheese, onion mash, and slaw.  We also ordered a half rack of ribs with brisket, along with cornbread and brussel sprouts. I'll start with the meh... the portion of hot links was rather small, all of the sides were mediocre at best, with the cornbread being extremely disappointing (was too dry/dense/heavy/flavorless).  I love a good cornbread, so was rather let down.  As for the meats themselves, the pulled pork and brisket were highlights; the ribs had a good flavor, but I prefer a \\"fall off the bone\\" style vs. nawing off the bone.  The burnt ends were very fatty.  We finished up with the vanilla/banana pudding, which had a good flavor, but the bananas were rather chewy, which wasn't the texture I was expecting or looking for.  \\n\\nThe service was good for the most part; very friendly waiter, who occasionally disappeared for a longer stretches, but not unreasonably so.

I was feeling a bit of disparity between the commonplace feel vs. the price, but similar to the service, it wasn't unreasonable.  \\n\\nOverall, I think the place is ok, I'd say they're a 3.5 start place, rounded down based on me wanting them to be more/better than they were (especially the cornbread!)."},{"name":"Eat Me Thai","address":"6364 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great authentic style Thai food.

When the waiter asked about drinks I inquired about the happy hour and he said that was only for the bar area.  Seriously?!  So I could walk the 20 feet to the bar and order a drink at happy hour prices but couldn't order the same at our table? Plus the website did not specify the bar only. My husband ordered grilled calamari as an appetizer but when it came to the table there was nothing grilled about it. He ate it and said it tasted ok but would have been much better had it actually been grilled. On the recommendation of the waiter I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. I went to take the first bite and the \\"cheesy sauce\\" was the consistency of milk. I asked the waiter if that is how it's supposed to be and he said, \\"It's a cream based sauce but it looks like they just didn't reduce it enough. It's really good though\\" and walked away.  On that note, I decided to give it a try in spite of the runny sauce. The lobster was nice and fresh, but the dish was overly salted and I just couldn't get past the runny sauce. At the table  next to us, two people ordered a blackened fish dish and both sent it back because the fish came out undercooked and there wasn't a trace of anything blackened about it.

I had gone three times to their two locations and was never really impressed. I had tried the pulled pork, the chicken, the fries, the maduros, even a banh mi (which I have to say was the best of everything I tried) to find a dish I loved but nothing. So I gave up on trying to love, even like this local favorite. \\n\\nFast forward a few months and I'm scrolling through my FB feed and long and behold my friends are raving about this place. So after some pondering and thinking maybe this time I will like it I gave it another shot; boy I'm glad I did. \\nI went with my food critic in training aka the kid on a late Saturday afternoon. Not too busy but with plenty of tables occupied. We got the chicken and rib combo, plain Jane pulled pork sandwich, Mexican street corn, dragon green beans, French fries and yuca frita. \\n\\nWe sat and waited for our order that came quick. The first thing we tried was the ribs and I have to say, wow. They were super tender and fell off the bones. The chicken was super scrumptious as well. Juicy and with wonderful seasoning. The kid completely forgot about his sandwich and devoured more than half the plate. The yuca frita was good with the homemade mayo ketchup with just the right amount of garlic like the do it back in Puerto Rico. The fries were good and seasoned but the kid was not a fan. The green beans were amazing and one of my favorite dishes. The Mexican street corn was very good although I prefer mine off the cob. The pulled pork sandwich was okay. I found the pork to be a little on the dry side. \\n\\nOverall I understand the love with Pig Floyds. The food is good and I just shuck the other experiences to just a bad day; something that we all have. \\n\\nThe place is clean, organized, not overly loud. The employees are nice and attentive. The owner shows that he cares and goes around asking the diners how everything is. He is super friendly and genuinely cares about the quality of the food. \\n\\nI will go back.

Sometimes I just need to feel the comfort food vibes of TooJay's. A few years back I didn't love this place as much, but what galvanized my opinion is this-sometimes southern food is just too much, a lot of fried flavor and butter on everything. TooJay's is different, it has the Jewish deli flavor that is totally a departure from southern food, but it's novel to find in Central Florida. \\n\\nMy go-to's (more than one) are the Rachel sandwich, the triple J sandwich, deli shrimp salad, loaded latkes, matzo ball soup, and some coleslaw and pickle on the side. The deli shrimp salad is bathed in a light mayo dressing and it's so refreshing in the summer. The Rachel sandwich and a nice bowl of matzo ball are perfect when you're feeling under the weather. Enjoy it all with a Dr. brown's cel-ray celery soda. Order a can of it to drink with your sandwich, it really compliments the flavors.

I'd be happy to come eat here again, but I probably wouldn't choose it myself. \\n\\nFood: IMHO, this place really puts the American in Americanized Mediterranean food. The chicken & beef gyro were nice juicy cuts of meat, but had little spice or flavor depth. It's fairly disappointing to not have a lamb option at a gyro place. The toppings were very meh, just standard lettuce tomato onion and green pepper - fresh, but items very easily pulled out of my own refrigerator. However, the white sauce is bomb!! Put that on everything. I was warned the hot sauce is no joke spicy, which my coworkers later confirmed. We were told the hummus and baba ganouj were extra so I didn't try it. It's a bummer you don't get hummus in a platter that comes with pita...\\n\\nService: This is where things got confusing - there were about 5 people behind the counter, all super eager to help. My coworker was told he could add hummus to his platter for $1, which he accepted and received a side portion, which he was later charged $3. Another coworker said she's gotten a free scoop of hummus when she got a platter - which is it?! Lastly, they told us they do not validate parking, which by all other accounts they do validate... These small incidents added up to the feeling that the staff didn't quite know their policies/menu. \\n\\nOverall, this place is good to grab a quick bite at a reasonable price point (~$10).
