Upon the announcement of a Chicago-style hot dog establishment, I got excited. Really excited. The months went on. The opening got delayed. Finally, this autumn, I got to visit Dirty Frank's for the first time. The art was cool. The atmosphere was quirky and fun-- typical Liz Lessner. But the food? Sub-par. I got the Razzle Dazzle, a dog topped with cream cheese and grilled vegetables. All the parts? Delicious on their own. But they didn't work quite right together.\\n\\nA few months later I went back for an inexpensive mid-afternoon snack. I ordered a chili dog which arrived in a soft bun topped with a plentiful amount of meaty sauce and a handful of shredded cheddar that seemed more like US Food Service than the tangy Wisconsin cheese I was accustomed to finding at home slathered inside buns for burgers and dogs and served alongside fries. I left, once again, sated but not incredibly impressed.\\n\\nAfter a few days of mulling it over, I realized what's wrong with the Dirty Frank's formula. A Vienna Beef dog in a steamed Rosen's poppy seed bun is a beautiful thing-- a simple thing. And while quirky and eclectic twists on homey dishes are often a fun way to re-experience or rediscover favorites, some things are perfect the way they are. And hot dogs are just sacred.\\n\\nTo note: Dirtyoke, Dirty Frank's Monday night karaoke, is great. It's a nice, solid crowd but not too busy that you won't be able to get up for a few songs. The MC is always taking suggestions, eager to expand his songbook and repertoire. Get some shots and a delicious basket of fried leeks.

House margaritas are mostly sour mix.\\n\\nBorder Cafe has a large menu of great tex mex standards as well as some more adventurous offerings such as their Chicken Guadalajara and their Filet Mignon Jim Bowie Style. Many of their items have a Cajun twist to them that gives them unique qualities, like their Shrimp and Crawfish Quesadilla. The food quality is great and Border Cafe is an excellent place for a date night or with a group of friends. \\n\\nIf you are planning on eating as a group, either go there early (before 6pm) or have your whole party there as early as possible to sign in and then have a margarita or two at the bar while waiting. Avoid the house margaritas, they are very weak, especially on big days such as Cinco De Mayo where they are pre-made. Instead, anything made to order should not disappoint.\\n\\nOnce you are actually seated, service is surprisingly fast and efficient, even for large groups. The food should come out quickly and is very well prepared and presented. They are good at keeping their excellent fresh chips and salsa flowing and do a good job of bringing drinks. Just do them a favor if in a big group and have everyone ask for any extra sides, condiments, etc. all at once rather than nickel and diming their time.\\n\\nBorder Cafe is definitely worth trying on the merits of its food alone, but its festive atmosphere and capability of handling large groups makes it a great destination for an entertaining night.

Arrived right before 7pm on a Saturday night. place was packed so i figured it should be good. I was with my family- 5 of us total - The place for being a \\"mexican\\" restaurant was filled with white staff. That didn't bother me though as race doesn't matter. Anyone can be a good or crappy cook.\\n\\nFirst off the chips and salsas. You are given chips and two types of salsa. The salsas did NOT taste home made. It tasted like it came straight from a can. One was cold and the other was warmed. Both had WAY too much tomato flavor. No spice. No zest. nothing that salsa should have. It was like eating tomato paste/sauce out of the jar. \\n\\nI had two cheese enchiladas and a beef taco. The Enchilada had way too much cheese and actually tasted like velveeta cheese then actual real cheese. The \\"hot\\" sauce had bits of huge chilis in it and wasn;t \\"hot\\" at all. The taco was pretty much the only good thing that I liked. The meat had a decent amount of seasonings.\\n\\nPrices are a bit high. Came to almost $80 for the 5 of us. All of us had soda. no ridiculous add ons. Granted, we all been to other actual mexican restaurants.  and it came closer to $40 bucks\\n\\nFirst and last time at this place."},{"name":"Bestsellers Cafe","address":"24 High St","city":"Medford","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in for some coffee and a snack an to get some work done.

The coffee drink and snack were good, and I also bought a loaf of artisan bread from the shelves over on the side. This place is big, with front book displays when you walk in, an area dominated by the food and drink counter and some other displays in the middle, more book racks, the way back space looking out onto the river and then a nice nook over on the far right in back, where I chilled out in the simulated living room-feel area and got work done.  There was a duo playing what sounded like folkie Irish music to a small appreciative crowd in the back/riverview part. Definitely support this place.

The menu offers something for all appetites - from sandwiches to full entrees. I also love the variety of sides to choose from - the more veggies the better.\\n\\nOne small negative is the service can be a bit slow. We have personally experienced a bit of a lag on a couple of occasions. And one time when I was with a larger group of 8, I noticed that the table of 4 next to us who were seated at the same time hadn't even ordered when our entrees were served. I could feel their frustration.\\n\\nDespite the small negative, we will definitely return again and again.\\n\\nUpdate - We booked a Valentine's dinner here and was very disappointed to find the regular menu replaced by a special menu.

Like other Yelpers mentioned, I got there before the restaurant opened, around 10am on a Friday morning (well, everyone said 9, but we were late to get our day started) - I wanted to make sure I got what I wanted! The line was down the parking lot and the wait didn't feel as long as it did, and definitely not as miserable (it was overcast). \\n\\nWe finally got into the restaurant and ordered about 2 hours later.

I grabbed a piece of the ribs cuz that's what was right in front of me and everyone grabbed brisket. My first bite of the ribs was actually surprisingly good - nice peppery taste, but it wasn't fall off the bone. Then I grabbed myself a piece of the brisket, slopped on some sauce, and thought...hmm, this brisket isn't all that great. Realized after I was done that my friends all grabbed the fatty brisket which is what I wanted!!! Ugh...no wonder I wasn't in love with the brisket. The lean brisket was way too dry and tough for me. Once I realized the fatal error, I looked for a fatty piece of the brisket and ate it...so much better, but I think being full at that point didn't help. The sausage wasn't anything to write home about, but I do love my sausage. \\n\\nBy the time we were done around 12:30, there were still people coming to the restaurant, so I'm really curious how much more food they had by that point.

On Yelp, it said that they do not take reservations but they do if the party is 6 or more. \\n\\nWe ordered their fried chicken, hush puppies, and corn bread. The fried chicken was my favorite! I loved how it moist and juicy, although it did get too salty after a few bites. The hush puppies were delicious as well but what was disappointing was that it tasted EXACTLY like the corn bread, except fried instead of baked. It seemed like they took the \\"lazy way out\\" when it came to their hush puppy recipe. The corn bread was the least favorite because it was on the drier and more salty side, and I prefer my cornbread moist and sweet. \\n\\nTLDR: \\nGood restaurant but probably would not come again because the wait can be a hassle.

Most of the dishes are very competent,  although some are not particularly memorable. Expect a crowd, particularly on weekends; don't let the long lines get to you, as they move very quickly.  Get here by 10 a.m. and you probably will not have a wait.  We have eaten here over a dozen times, and the service varies.  Sometimes you get a sea of carts going past your table.  Others you are lucky if you can catch a server's eye.  I will tell you this...you will get a taste of what minorities experience in our country on a regular basis when you eat here.  Caucasians usually represent 25% of the patrons, and they are treated differently than the Asian clientele.  We were seated once with a lovely Asian family, who candidly told us that if we were not seated with them we would not have gotten the good service  we did that day.  We were stunned to see how much more frequently the servers stopped at our table than when we ate alone.

We returned this week and brought our family from out of town to enjoy the Magical Dining menu.  I definitely had some high expectations from the last visit, and I really felt a bit left down this time.  \\n\\nNow, I have have no complaints about the food, I liked everything I tried.  I started with the shrimp and gouda flatbread and also tried my husband's veal stuffed pepper.  Both were great!   For my entree I had the veal chop.  I loved how it was served with the lemon on top, it really added to the flavor.  I thought it  paired perfectly with the arugula cranberry salad, anything heavier would have been too much since the veal was breaded and a nice size.  I had the coconut cake before, so I already knew that was good.  I heard the cannolis were excellent too!\\n\\nOur family felt the children's menu left a bit to be desired so they asked if they could split a magical dining for the kids, but the waiter said the $15 splitting fee would still apply for kids. So they ended up spending less money than the $33 magical dining and got the kids the pasta and pizza from the kids menu, which the kids thought were just okay.  I get rules are rules, so I can't complain about this too much, but wouldn't they have rather made a bigger sale and had happier customers?  I TOTALLY get why those rules are in place for adults, but they were 6 and 8 years old. \\n\\nThe major negative issue during our dining experience was that the food took so incredibly long!  They appetizers came in reasonable time, but after that it went downhill without explanation.  I mean it was over a half an hour from clearing the app plates till dinner, then another half an hour from clearing the dinner plates till dessert.  Don't get me wrong, we had wonderful time hanging out with our family, but it really was a bit much.\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning, we got auto gratuitied for 4 adults and 2 children.  It was 20% and they took it from not just the total, but the total after the tax.\\n\\nI'm hoping this was just an off night in the kitchen.

You can use it, too.  To be sonsied means to have an experience where you paid way too much for flavorless food and terrible service.  Usage in a sentence: We were sonsied.  (You don't have to capitalize the \\"s\\".)  There is a secondary meaning  to the verb that is not specific to any restaurant and that is when you end up splitting the bill in a way that is disproportionate to what you ordered--in the bad way.  That is, you pay more than your fair share.  This is not a restaurant's fault, this is just a human nature fault.  Unfortunately, both meanings happened to us that night.\\n\\nBut back to Sonsie: Our waitress was so bad that when we asked for her advice on what to get, she said the grouper (which was a special).  I guess she didn't think we'd take her advice because I did and she came back to say they didn't have it.  She brought the completely wrong entree for my husband, who ordered a cheeseburger pizza.  She was a true fiasco.  \\n\\nThe entree I had instead came from the menu--tagliatelle with bolognese and honestly, it was completely flavorless--which seems impossible and yet, Sonsie chefs figured out a way.  If the entree was $8.00, it would hurt much less but instead, it's more like $17 which is low for a Boston restaurant but way too high for the plate I received.\\n\\nThen the bill came.

Time is precious and waiting in line for 3 hours just didn't sound like a fun thing to do. Boy, was I wrong! Waiting in line at Franklins was a hoot! It was one of the coolest and most memorable things we did in Austin. \\n\\nThere was such a neat sense of community with all the other BBQ enthusiasts in line. BBQ lovers are friendly people. If you are the outgoing type(vs the type who has their head stuck in a phone, iPad or computer in line) then you'll love the wait because everyone will become your friend. You'll all bond over the fact that you got out of bed way too early and are waiting 3 hours for a restaurant to open. \\n\\nFranklins has fold up picnic style chairs you can borrow, but some people brought their own because on previous visits they've been there when those complimentary chairs run out. We had some pros near us in line. They even brought a cooler full of beer to drink while waiting. Beer at 8 am? Sure, why not. When you are waiting for some of the worlds best BBQ it's ok to throw a few back before noon. \\n\\nIf you didn't bring any beer with you, no fear. The super awesome people at Franklins will come around and take your order and they'll sell you some tasty local brews. Definitely purchase the cool Franklins beer coozy to have as a memento.  I'm still flippin out about how cool it was to be able to drink beer while waiting in line for Franklins to open. In Cali, that wouldn't be kosher with the authorities, but in Austin, it seems to be a-ok. \\n\\nWhile you are waiting in line someone will come around and take your order for the food as well. It isn't set in stone. It's an estimate of what you think you are going to order. We overestimated how much we wanted to order and when we got to the front counter we cut it down substantially when we saw how much the quantities actually were. \\n\\nThis is what we ended up ordering for 3 people-2 guys who can eat heartily and me who rarely eats meat: 2lbs of brisket, 1lb of ribs, 1/2 lb of pulled pork. I tried to talk the guys into ordering even less but they wouldn't have any of it. We had invested our time in line, this was the thing that they looked forward to the most in Austin, and we were going to go all in. I feel guilty every time I eat meat knowing how it's production affects the environment. Le sigh. But I'm at Franklins and meat I will eat! \\n\\nWe ended up having lots of leftover food. The guys declared, it was because I didn't eat my fair share. We packaged it to go and for the next couple of days we were eating leftovers on the road. We'd wake up at a hotel and reheat the meat in the provided coffee cups. It was quite the funny sight to see slices of brisket fanned in a coffee cup with the long ends wilting over. \\n\\nCall me a wierdo but I actually preferred the taste of the reheated brisket over the fresh stuff. I liked how the flavors seemed bolder and the meat held together better. I'm not used to falling off the bone ribs and meltingly tinder brisket. Having them on day two reheated made them taste more \\"normal\\" lol. \\n\\nBefore we visited Franklins we watched YouTube videos on Franklins and the meticulous BBQ process. They were incredibly informative videos and made our visit to Franklins that much richer. Highly recommend everyone else doing the same as well. \\n\\nI don't know if the BBQ Gods were smiling down upon us that day, but as we approached the checkout counter Aaron Franklin came out from the back, and we were able to chat with him, shake his hand and tell him how awesome he was.

I checked into my hotel in Peabody, Massachusetts dog -tired after a lot of driving and a full day outside. I asked the front desk person about local Italian restaurants that may deliver - particaully the big Italian place I passed coming in.  She immediately referred me to Marco's Authentic Italian Restaurant as a much better alternative.  A quick walk up the hill in front of the hotel brought me to a rather nondescript strip mall of 4-5 fairly upscale shops.  Looks can be VERY deceiving here folks.  I unexpectedly walked into a little bit of Italy tonight when I went through the front door.  I was greeted by the owner Marco himself - a true Italian with a quick smile and a welcoming attitude.  I was seated and the menu and wine list brought over to me. Marco was kindly instructing a new waiter in the art of Customer Service and doing a remarkable job coaching and encouraging him through each step in the process.  \\n\\nI asked which pastas were homemake and Marco enthusiactically pointed out that 6 or 7 of them were including the gnocchi.  I saw the Chicken Parmesan and asked if I could also have a side of gnocchi - it had been years since I've had great gnocchi.  Marco said they don't normally serve it as a side dish but he would take care of it.  Fresh bread was brought out accompanied by a dish of three dips - roasted and crushed garlic, olive oil and melted butter.  It's a small touch, but it was easy to identify both the garlic and olive oil by the piece of olive and garlic in their respective dishes.  When the food arrived my mouth dropped open a bit - huge portion sizes.  The chicken breasts had been butterflied and opened - lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. Over the chicken was a beautiful homemade marinara sauce and mozzarella chesse. As you can see from the picture, the food was plated beautifully.  It tasted even better than it looked!  The flavors were rich and complex, the pasta was done perfectly al-dente and the gnocchi were potato pillows of delight.\\n\\nMarco came by to see how everything was and I found that he was raised in Genoa, Italy. For those who may not know, Genoa has been nicknamed la Superba (\\"the Proud one\\") due to its glorious past and impressive landmarks.  It is fitting that Marco should be raised in a place such as that.  While Marco himself appears to be a man of humility, the restaurant he has created is indeed la Superba - Proud to represent the best of Italian fare in the town of Peabody, Mass. I suspect, if not already, that Marco's will indeed become an impressive landmark in its own right as the place to go for authentic Italian fare in the local area. As my travels allow, I will, most certainly, be back to enjoy this wonderful food and hospitality as often as I can.  If you haven't already gathered - I highly recommend Marco's. If you are anywhere within twenty-miles go find this place and enjoy a great meal.\\n\\nOttimo lavoro Marco - grazie."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Well I made the cut.

I rarely go to higher end restaurants, but I figured I would splurge for the holiday.  Unfortunately, Cocotte did put a bit of a damper on my plans.  \\n\\nI had booked my reservation for OpenTable.  When I arrived in the restaurant, I gave my name but was told that there was another \\"Kristin\\" with a different last name than mine.  I was having a minor freak out because my plans might have just been flushed down the toilet.  I knew for sure I made reservations and wasn't trying to party crash on one of the busiest days of the year.  The reservation was for 915 and I knew I wouldn't be able to find a table for Valentine's Day.  They had me sit at the bar while they figured out the situation. \\n\\nThey gave me the menu and I was quite perplexed to see only the prix fixe menu for Valentine's Day listing a hair-raising $70 price tag per person.  I was aware beforehand that there would be a prix fixe but I thought the regular menu would also be available.  I had been looking forward to trying their signature dish and some escargot, but these plans were shot down by a $140 arrow into my wallet.  It just bothers me that the menu abandoned their regular menu and didn't clarify on their website that they would only be serving their overpriced prix fixe.\\n\\nThe manager comes over to the bar and explains that they have reservation down as cancelled.  I show them the OpenTable confirmation for my reservation and they surmise that they must have accidentally cancelled the wrong Kristin's reservation.  So they promise to seat me soon and apologize for their error.  They try their best to apologize, which I appreciate but I feel like they could have done more to apologize for the error.  I would have like a small gesture like a complimentary drink or something.  This would make up for the confusion and the embarrassment I felt.  \\n\\nAs soon as we are seated in the private dining area, I realized that they really attempted to preserve an intimate atmosphere for the occasion.  However, some of the music choices were a bit odd, like the postmodern electro-grunge tunes tossed in with Miles Davis.  We are given pretty good service.  The servers bring the food promptly and constantly fill the water glasses.  We asked them to refill our bread, which they did after some reminding.  \\n\\nFor the first course, we had the scallops and the pate.  Both were decent, but not mind blowing.  We had the mussels and curried carrot soup for the second course.  The mussels were delicious, but the carrot soup could have benefited from more acid to make it less one-note.  The combination of carrots, coconut milk, and cashews lended too many sweet notes.  For the third course, we had the salmon and the duck breast.  Both were tasty and well balanced, but the portion sizes were ridiculously small.  We were done after 5 or 6 bites.  \\n\\nI've had prix fixe menus before, but the portions here were ridiculously tiny.  I have never been a fan of being handed 2 inches of food on a 10 inch plate.  Perhaps, it was my fault for expecting more food.  However, I don't think the sizes justified the $70 price tag.  The fourth course included blue cheese and a tiny crumbled meringue-like wafer.  The wafer on my plate had not been crumbled even though the one on my partner's was.  I can hardly fault the kitchen for a minor mistake on such a busy day, but it was a bit more difficult to eat as a whole wafer.  I would have liked if they offered a slice of bread with the cheese to cut some of its richness.  We had to ask for bread, which they did bring us.  \\n\\nThe fifth and last course included a chocolate tart and almond cake.  Both were delicious and satisfying, but were a little sweet.  The chocolate tart could have benefited from more than just a couple of squirts of raspberry coulis and the almond cake could have used more of the apricot jam they smeared on the plate. \\n\\nI left the restaurant with a sour taste in my mouth, which certainly wasn't from the overly sweet desserts.   Overall, the food was fair, but nothing was that memorable.  My night was spoiled by the reservation confusion and the high price tag.  Maybe it was my fault for choosing a higher end restaurant for a special occasion, but I was expecting a hassle free night with mind-blowing food which I thought a higher end restaurant could deliver.  This night has made me reconsider ever going out for Valentine's Day.  From now on, I think I'll just stay home and cook."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"While on vacation we reached picked one thing we really wanted to do.

They say that there are supposed to be hors d'oeuvres but only saw fried mushrooms as mozzarella-sticks.  We each got a few mushrooms but the mozzarella disappeared in seconds so no luck. Our server Joey was great. Not sure how he was able to take care of so many people but he was amazing.  The food was fair.

We went EARLY, like before 11 and that was the key!  We got in right away and the food carts swarmed down on us quickly, I was pointing and saying yes so fast!  This time we were more impressed with the variety of food we got and it was tasty!!!!  We ate in less than an hour and were all stuffed when we left!  Again, we decided to skip dessert mainly because we never really saw a dessert cart go by and got dessert at the bakery down the street.  Still a solid four stars!!!  It will never get 5 from me because my fav dim sum place is in SF and London...\\n\\nOH and we found that the garage right next to Hei La Moon is a flat rate of $10!!!\\n\\n\\nFinally, I've discovered a great dim sum place!  I'm so excited!!!  After hearing from people that this was the best in Boston, my family decided to check it out.  We got there around 11am on a Sunday and there were already packs of people waiting!  After shoving my way to the entrance and after people rudely shoving their way ahead of me, I looked the lady who was handling the \\"list\\" and put up 4 fingers (the lady behind me was already speaking in Chinese to her, trying to get a number before me!), she graciously gave me my number first (HA!) and then it was the waiting game.\\n\\nHaving 2 little kids with us, that was fun, let me tell you!  I had to keep standing by the lady calling out the numbers, because it was so hard to understand her!  She had her mouth too close to the mic, so the sounds were all muffled!  Frustrating...\\n\\nBut finally, we got seated in a pleasant window seat with plenty of room for my kids to be comfy.\\n\\nThe food came fast and it was worth it!  Soooo delicious and warm and BIG!  I couldn't believe how big the dumplings were!\\n\\nSo, why only 4 stars?  Well, the variety wasn't great, I am used to a lot of different things, and the only vegetable we saw was the broccoli, which we got.  And my husband almost got sick when he saw how dirty the bowls were that the woman serving up the tofu was using.  I mean DIRTY like they had never been cleaned before!  Luckily we didn't get that and also after that we were on the lookout for substandardly clean utensils, plates, bowls, etc...  And the desserts were seriously lacking, mainly because she kept avoiding us even after we flagged her down!\\n\\nThe service isn't great, they try to explain what it is, but unless you speak their language, sometimes it's tough to understand what is inside some of the items.\\n\\nHowever, the price is wonderful!  It was only $40 for us to eat and that EASILY would have been doubled at my fav place in SF Yank Sing.\\n\\nWe ended up getting perfectly pleasant pastries at the store down the street.\\n\\nMy only complaint about Chinatown is the lack of parking.

Crepe for dinner is utterly possible.\\n\\nI came in for HH literally a few minutes before it would end and the hostess graciously accommodated me.  She recommended me the caramelized brussel sprouts and the savory crepe.  I was a little hesitant with ordering the sprouts because I swear I've had it every way possible you can with that darn vegetable and never found it really palatable.  However, the caramelized sprouts with the banyuls vinegar made me realized that I'm not a lost cause for this vegetable!!!  YES, I'm not weird!  I DO like brussel sprouts!  \\n\\nThe brussel sprouts were tender and well-seasoned and didn't have a bitter aftertaste (I swear brussel sprouts made every other way has this underlying taste!  Maybe I'm still weird).  I was even slicing the cabbage so I could prolong the enjoyment of the meal.  The only small complaint I have is that the last clumps of residual leaves had soaked up the vinegar and herbs so the flavor was pretty potent and had a bit of an overpowering mustard taste.  I had to leave the residual leaves unfinished.\\n\\nThe only time I've ever had crepe was for breakfast and it was covered with either lemon juice and mounds of powdered sugar or smeared with insane amounts of nutella.  So this savory crepe for dinner was a bit of an adventure for me.  However, it was delightfully tasty and filled with mouth-watering oyster mushrooms and melted gruyere.    It made me re-think my whole crepe-for-breakfast-only philosophy.\\n\\nI also ordered the tarte au citron, which tasted kind of like a lemon curd tart.  It was good and nothing too spectacular, but the homemade creme fraiche was amazing.  It was not too sweet and made a perfect complement to the tartness of the pie.  The tart was also covered with pomegranate pearls -- I'm not sure exactly what they are made of, but I loved the texture of it.

Don't listen to that nobody who says that it's not as good as all that; it is. \\n\\nThat being said, here's the skinny:\\n\\nI got the brisket (moist, hell yeah!), sausage, and ribs. My favorite of the three was hands-down sausage. Not just because I like sweet, delicious sausage in my mouth, either. I'm talking about paper-thin casing, melt-in-your mouth internals. The only thing more delicious would be if this sausage was forged by Lt. General Sausage himself and tailored specifically to your tastebuds. \\n\\nNext, let's talk about the brisket. This brisket is great. I only got the moist kind and didn't try the dry but hey, I'm only human. That stuff was awesome. It had enough flavor to stand on its own but went just as splendidly with the barbecue sauce provided.\\n\\nI think this would be a good time to talk abou the sause. Now, no BBQ joint can be better than it's salsa (spanish for sauce, not the tomato condiment) so I feel it necessary to give it its own paragraph. Here's what I though. The espresso was the best-o. It went well with all three meats but best with the brisket. Brisket's kinda made for that sort of thing though, soaking up all the juices like a dirty cut of meat. Next I'd say was their sweet, carolina-style sauce. This stuff was excellent on the wings. EXCELLENT. However, I'd have to caution against using it on the other meat items as it can be a little overwhelming to the delicate palette. The standard BBQ was, well, standard. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination but, in this case, falls short of extraordinary\\n\\nLast and least I'll talk to you all about the ribs. Were they tender? Were they juicy? Were they something special? Yes, yes, and yes. They were all of those things. Just because they fell short of the ribs and the sausage (oh, god, the sausage) doesn't mean they weren't special in their own right. If you want to get ribs, get ribs. you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nNow, for a second, I want to talk about the wait. It's long. It's tedious. Bring beer. I actually ate breakfast tacos when I got in line... at 9am. That being said, I think the wait was part of the experience. It wouldn't be the same without the wait. It's feels like a sort of tradition... a holdover from simpler times when this was just a bbq joint in a trailer. You may not be willing to wait (because you have terminal cancer? I dunno) but there's a shortcut. You can always order ahead and get your food as early as 10:30 without having to wait in line. I think there's a minimum for that but, hey, there's a premium to cut in line."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Never again.\\n\\nI've been coming to the Border since high school, and have always enjoyed my time there, whether it was for drinks and snacks, or full dinner.  You can't beat the prices, and the food has always been hot, fresh and tasty.\\n\\nNever again.\\n\\nMet a colleague there for drinks and snacks last night.  Wasn't thrilled with the chips, they tasted over cooked and the fry oil clearly needed to be changed.  (This is not a guess, I've been in food service for 15 years, I know what dirty old fry oil tastes like.)  Fine, it's early evening, and a snowstorm, I'll let it go.\\n\\nWe ordered queso, which is a standard for me at the border.  It was runny like I've never seen before.  It still had decent flavor, and was warm enough, but was unusually thin.  Okay, much like the chips, I'm willing to let this go, because it still tastes \\"okay\\" and what I'm really looking forward to is my cajun popcorn shrimp, another favorite.\\n\\nAnd here's where I sadly realize that I'll never be back: it's freezer burnt.  As in, some pieces are white-ish gray.  We tell the bartender that we don't want it, and she offers to get us another batch.  We decline.  She is nice enough, and clearly feels terrible.  Have I mentioned that it is immediately visible that the shrimp are off color?\\n\\nShe takes the shrimp off the check with a void, which I presume means she had to interact with a manager and explain what happened, yet no one swings by.  She returned the freezer burnt shrimp to the kitchen, which means that not only did someone let it go out, but someone saw it come back.  Still, no visit.\\n\\nThere were two managers on, one of whom we had to ask to move out of the door frame to leave, yet no check in.  \\n\\nIt's sad to lose one of my favorite spots for a meal, but it's gone.  \\n\\nAlso, it might be worth noting that their website has no contact information for feedback, which, like the lack of contact from a manager, leads me to believe that they don't care to hear when something is terrible."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I love this place, but the last time I visited, our drinking glasses had that wet dog smell that you get when the washing machine needs to be cleaned.

They have this cool tracking device so you grab a table and they know exactly where to bring your food out to. While you're ordering, they have some people working behind glass windows which you can spy on and check out what they're cooking up. I have to mention all the staff from the cashier to the bartender to the people checking in on tables was just wonderful. Everyone was so friendly, I got some compliments on my dress, they cleared things quickly but weren't hovering over us - just excellent service from start to finish. Paper towels for napkins are on the tables but you'll need to grab your sauces (seven to pick from!) & silverware before sitting down. They have a good number of outdoor seats if the weather is nice, indoor low tables & booths, as well as high tops and a few belly up bar seats outside & inside, as well. The bar seats have purse hooks & outlets for devices which is a nice & helpful touch.\\n\\nThey have local beer from their own Cask & Larder Brewery which was an awesome surprise. You can get a flight for $10 and try 4 of their beers. I'm not going to say any blew me away but it was fun being able to try a few of their different offerings. My favorite of the 4 I tried was their C&L Working Man Porter which you can also get a pitcher of for. With a pop being and a beer flight, it was easy for me to make a decision to go with some libations with lunch. If hard drinks are more your thing, they have a huge bourbon offering.\\n\\nThey are all about modern BBQ and modern they are. The best thing we ate was the deep fried AND smoked chicken. I can't explain how huge and juicy this chunk of bird was. I honestly am going to be craving this perfectly cooked chicken until the time I can get it back in my mouth. It was just so incredibly good - do NOT skip it if you go to Pok-e-Jo's Smokehouse.

The bacon was salty, as bacon is, the egg was overcooked (should be runny yolk on a burger), and the cheese was barely there. It was not much different than eating hot beef jerky.

In addition, the sandwiches always come out piping hot and the cheese is perfectly melted. If you want to add more hotness, there are about 20 different hot sauces to choose from on the counter.  My favorites would be the Thai garlic, Cholula, and the BBQ sauce in the jar.\\n\\nCons: One thing that a sandwich place like Subway's wins over Firehouse is the price.  The 6-inch meal or just the full length sub is $7.99 and up.  Eight, eight dollar, eight dollar footlong.\\n\\nIf you like fresh-tasting, hot and spicy sandwiches, nothing beats Firehouse.

The buffet was plain scrambled eggs, plain toast, plain French toast, the blandest griddled pancakes I've EVER eaten, sausage (which was good), sausage gravy (also good), bacon (good), BBQ frittata (very bland) and an omelette bar. The menu listed cheddar biscuits but we did not see any while we were there. The buffet-style set up would have been impossible for me to serve myself if my husband weren't there to help since the items were served on a bar-height counter in the standard catering style warmers with elevated feet. The lids on the warmers had to be completely pulled off to access the food and there was no room to set the lids or a plate on the counter. Serving myself would have consisted of me removing and holding a giant tray cover, balancing my plate, serving myself while somehow holding both the lid and my plate, and then putting the lid and serving spoon back while still holding my plate. Trying to do all of this on a bar-height countertop where the warming trays were elevated even higher by their raised feet would have been impossible. I'm not sure what they were thinking with this brunch buffet menu but the whole thing seemed poorly thought out and lazy. Perhaps they should nix the buffet altogether or give it a makeover with more specialty meat items (bacon stuffed pancakes? sausage stuffed French toast?) and an easier to access set-up. \\n\\nOverall the quality food was not what I would expect from Barrel and Boar (we've been to the North Market location) and we both left feeling like our $30 would have been better spent literally anywhere else.

The meat barely fell of the bone with some tugging with a fork. The hotlink, pulled pork, and brisket was just ok.  As long as you choose to douse these in one of the four BBQ sauces available (Soul Fire, Fiery, Sweet, and Pitboss), then it all tastes great.  My favorite was the Sweet.  The Southern Fried wings were a little too salty for my liking.  The best parts of the entire meal were the potato salad (I swear they put crack in it), the spicy wings, and the corn bread.

There's a shaved root vegetable in there with a flavor I'm unfamiliar with... so good! Lots of greens and veggies, huge portion. The acorn jelly itself was interesting at first, but we found ourselves avoiding it as we ate the salad. It didn't taste bad, but the flavor was pretty minimal and the texture, while fun at first, became out of balance with the dish. \\n\\nI would definitely enjoy encountering Ajumama again, but for now I've checked it off my list and won't feel the need to chase it down.\\n\\nI had this review as a 3-stars at first, but I'm going to round up for uniqueness points.

It was not too sweet, and the chilis were placed on a basil leaf so you did not have to put them all in the drink. It was a superb drink. Next off I had the beef tartar($15). It was quite nice, but under seasoned. It came with two dipping sauces-- one mustard, and one barbecue like sauce. Next off I had the Quail ($25) with a side of their brussel sprouts ($6). The sprouts were awesome. Very flavorful, and not cooked too much. I hate mushy brussel sprouts, and these were far from. The Quail was quite tender, but was lacking flavor/sauce of some kind.

But let me be clear:  This is less a review than a personal observation - everyone to their own poison, so to speak.\\n\\nHaving once tried (and failed) to get into this place when it had first opened, I originally satisfied myself that $9 was too much for ANY burger; but to wait an hour to pay that $9?  Not happening - not now, not ever.  Today, however, presented a real opportunity to see what Foster Burger was all about; it had just opened the door and my wife and I were the only ones there.  We selected a booth near the kitchen, were immediately greeted, served water consulted the menu.  Where were the $9 burgers I had seen on opening night?  Not on THIS menu!  So the paradigm changed with the $5 price tag, and I was beginning to wonder what I could truly expect for that $5.\\n\\nWe ordered the Foster Burger with cheese (five-cheese selection, $1 extra) and sadly noted that \\"All burgers are cooked medium.\\"  Being an eternal optimist (and a die-hard pain-in-the-ass when it comes to burgers), I asked if they couldn't please provide something of a medium rare variety, and the waiter said they would be happy to - and they DID!  It was absolutely perfect, and coupled with the sesame seed bun provided by the Vietnamese bakery next door elevated the experience considerably.  And I found the burger juicy, but not at all greasy.\\n\\nMy only criticism (and it's MY thing, not theirs) is that I tend to judge burger places by the sauce they use in putting the whole thing together - if I want to build my own burger, there's always Fuddrucker's.  I want that burger to come to me in completed fashion, as if to say, \\"OK, this is OUR burger.\\"  That said, the fact that they will cook excellent beef to order, then put in on a fabulously fresh bun overcomes everything else.\\n\\nSummary:  Great burger, excellent service, great price, in my neighborhood.  It doesn't get better than this!"},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Been said before but bears repeating:\\n\\n1, if you claim to be a Hot Dog Palace, then by all means focus your energies and attention on the quality of the hot dog itself...loading up all these toppings, and there are many, does not hide the fact that the hot dog itself is lacking in taste, texture and bite.\\n\\n2, if you are going to have on your menu hot dogs of a particular style, New York, Chicago, etc, make damned sure that someone in your establishment has actually been to these locales and actually tasted the hot dogs.. both the Dirty Franks's New York style(s) and Chicago style bare little if any resemblance to that which they attempt to emulate.\\n\\n3, i could recommend a location here in Columbus to obtain a decent hot dog - without tons of toppings - so you can taste the actual hot dog, but i don't want to make the review an ad for another business, so if you want the 411 on this, feel free to message :)\\n\\nPS, Coneys are not a product of Coney Island.

I had been studying for finals somewhere else but after I finished eating I got completely annoyed with some women who were sitting in the middle of the place chatting loudly...about being college instructors of all things.\\nSo since I had been wanting to try it since I found out it was opening, I headed to the other northside of 285 and found myself with a place all to myself. Perfect.\\n\\nI spent two hours with a French press of Long Island Strawberry green tea, which is $2.95 for the pot. I'd say it's about 16oz, and the only downfall for me is that I have sort of started to dislike French pressed tea because the leaves are still there and can make a green or white tea bitter if you take too long. That's just a personal thing because I am a snob with a cast iron teapot, but I much prefer the press to just getting the rest of my tea in some sort of other container.\\n\\nThere are tons of teas to choose from, what really sets TeaFuse apart from every other shop I've gone to is that you don't have to ask to smell a tea. There are racks of small vials of samples to smell, and then you can smell it from the canister too, which usually smells even better. \\nAnother plus: you can buy tea one ounce of tea, as most places make you start at 2, or only come packaged in 2 oz packages, or claim they cannot measure an ounce despite the fact you are standing right in front of a scale. The prices are on target with a lot of other shops in that manner, as teas start at $2.95 per ounce and go up. \\n\\nThe Long Island Strawberry green is delicious, but my favorite has to be one I brought home: Black Forest black tea. It's $3.75 for an ounce, smells of cherry, and has just the right amount of chocolate flavor. There is pretty much any tea you could ever want, and I even overheard the owner talking to a vendor, trying to source some more of some kind of rare tea for a tea fanatic. I thought that was cool. \\n\\nI believe they have a student discount, because I was given 10% off my teas after retelling a story about my intersecting majors making studying easier, which is awesome and in that case makes the tea even cheaper. \\n\\nI can't tell you about the little specialty drinks, because I am interested in just straight hot tea with nothing added to it. If you want bubble tea, you are better off heading to a place that is not a tea shop, I can tell you that much without even trying it. Lattes, sure, bubble tea, there are better places and that should go without saying.\\n\\nThere is a food menu, and some of it sounds so good, I wish I had just gone there from the start. They also have a breakfast menu and waffles on Saturday and Sunday. The menu on the website does not list prices, but all sandwiches and breakfast items are under $5 and can be made in lettuce cups for an extra $.75 or on gluten free bread for another $1. Soups are $2 for a cup and $3 for a bowl, cookies and scones and cakes are all under $3.\\n\\nThe menu on the website only lists the loose leaf tea prices, so as for drinks besides the previously mentioned French press of tea, they range from $3.25-$3.95 for tea drinks like lattes and frappes, $3.75-$4.00 for bubble tea drinks, and for coffee the prices range from $3 for plain coffee to $4.75 for a large vanilla caramel latte. There's also juice available for $2, and hot chocolate for $3. \\n\\nOn their Facebook page, they have some events listed like Friday Open Mic Nights and monthly tea tastings on Wednesdays. They have creme tea and afternoon tea, plus a couple other tea services with a theme, like Mediterranean and Caribbean, each with specific menus and tea choices. They range in price from $11 to $26 per person and I really want to do one someday.\\n\\n\\nIf you need some study/work time with tea, this is definitely a good place to go. They have free Wi-Fi if you purchase something, and plenty of outlets for laptops. They're also open every day unlike a lot of other shops.

I expected fries to come out a bit faster even though they are made fresh.  The place is clean and the food looks great but the speed seemed a bit slow.  Another thing that I guess was a bit distracting was how loud the music was.

Now, ridiculous can certainly be good, but ridiculous it is.\\n\\nEverything is overdone/extravagant - the decor, the food, the drinks, even the print on the menu. As everyone has said, fun, high calorie, carnival-like food. I've come here a couple times with friends who love it; once for brunch, and once for dinner. Brunch - I got a bowl of grits with sausage and eggs - nothing crazy. When I went for dinner, I got a corn dog and fries. Because, well, corn dogs are awesome and I'll always have one when there is an option. I got the corndogski, which is kielbasa. I almost didn't order it because on the menu there is a \\"warning\\" implying it will take a while to come out. But everything came out in a reasonable time.\\n\\nWhile I've liked everything I've had, I am not the target audience for Pallookaville. I recognize this. I almost feel like their awesomeness was wasted on me. Like, they had 5 million types of interesting sodas - which sounds cool, but I don't drink soda. You can get your fries cheesed, onioned, peppered, pastramied, poutined, pimento cheesed... which is overkill for me so I got mine plain. And they have all sorts of unique, cool-sounding specials and combinations.... which kind of make me feel like I would be sick if I ate them. Not sick because they were bad, but because you ate too much bad-for-you stuff at once. I even almost feel like I'll get a headache reading the menu which is (I know, intentionally) overloaded with colours, large fonts, and almost no white space.\\n\\nAnyway. If you are looking for something different and fun, by all means check it out. If you're trying to find something \\"normal\\" you may have to hunt a little. It's just the kind of place that I would personally have to space out my visits to, because I find it a little overwhelming. That said, I love corn dogs.

This place, btw, is Seat Yourself style. Not my favorite, because it means there's no record of you being there, and therefore no reason to check on the dining room.\\n\\nSo I sat myself and waited.

When I finally was noticed (and yes, I did try to grab her attention by calling a polite 'excuse me!\\"), I ordered the Grape Soda, which was an alcoholic drink that tasted like dimetap.\\n\\nI ordered some fries along with a pasta I still haven't been able to finish. The noodles were swimming in their sauce and it was simply flavorless.

I love kids, but not when they're let loose to roam free.\\n\\nThe staff was actually quite accommodating and nice, so that helps. One employee could tell I wasn't enjoying my visit, and had the kitchen burn off some of the excess sauce in my pasta, as well as add some cheese, which I really did appreicate.

I have sampled the chicken and pulled pork here and they were ok.  The chicken has been hit or miss but I think that is a general theme in BBQ spots across the world.  The sides are just a let down and I avoid them.  The ribs though are tasty.  They are super fall off the bone with light sauce.  Now I know a perfect rib will pull off the bone with ease but you could bite into the meat and acutally leave meat on the bone.  You wuold be able to see the bite and the doneness of the meat and all that.  Well these ribs slip right off the bone like they were in a crochet pot for a day.  They still retain some bite but they do more than just smoke them.  You can tell by the way the tasty bits of fat melt and the texture or the cartilidge.  I love to gnaw on the cartilidge and suck the fat out of the bones.  It is part of ribs and I love them.  I go here about once a year when people come from out of town and want to go.

So please read this review taking into account the fact that I was cold, tired, and VERY hungry.\\n\\nWe were greeted and promptly shown to a table right near a lovely gas fireplace. The restaurant was busy, but not uncomfortably so, just enough to give it atmosphere. The decor was very warm and cozy, lots of wood used throughout the restaurant. So altogether the atmosphere was a nice pick-me-up from the cold, wet New England winter weather outside. It did have a sort of predictable look to it though. As in, there was not much going on decor-wise that I haven't seen in dozens of other restaurants in my life. Not a bad thing, but nothing amazing either.\\n\\nOur waitress took an inordinate amount of time getting to our table. In fact, I had to ask a passing waitress who our server was, and where they were? The passing waitress was very helpful though. She took our drink orders and went and fetched our own waitress. A word on their drink selection. AWESOME! Maybe this is a New England thing, or maybe just a Boston thing, but this place had a fantastic beer selection. I was very impressed. They had at least a dozen or so beers on tap and they were almost all very high quality brews. So big thumbs up there.\\n\\nOur waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, she made several good recommendations. And she was quite friendly. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the Chicken Picata, and I ordered the Chicken and Broccoli Penne. The food was out within about 15 minutes. My meal was quite good. The pasta was well cooked, the chicken wasn't overcooked, and the dish was well seasoned. There could have been more fresh basil in the dish and the sauce was a bit thick for a \\"light cream sauce\\" but on the whole I'd say it was good. My girlfriends meal was also very good. The the standout of the meal though, in my opinion, were the potatoes that came with it. \\"Christopher's Potatoes\\" as they were called. DELICIOUS! The were like a cross between hash browns and mashed potatoes, all with lovely cheese! The chicken was nice, I think they might have been a bit heavy handed on the citrus (the menu says they use lime instead of the traditional lemon, it was a nice deviation from the ordinary). The chicken was nice and thinly breaded, not caked in a thick greasy coat of flour as you would usually find in places that don't know Italian food. Again, I think the fresh herbs described on the menu were very sparse. But other than that, the dish was quite good. \\n\\nAs for the price, at first it struck me as a bit on the pricey side, considering that the menu seemed at first-glance, pretty standard fare. Upon closer examination, though, I found that there were a lot of interesting things (the Buffalo Tofu seems intriguing, and they do seem to have a reputation for awesome burgers), that I had missed the first time round. And they seem to be fairly committed to using all natural meat too. So, on the whole, I think the pricing was fair.\\n\\nAll in all, this place was very good. I think they make efforts distinguish themselves amongst the sea of family restaurants in a way that is subtle enough to not scare off dad, mom, and their two kids, but interesting enough to give a couple out on a date some cool choices as well. I do think that they could've gone the extra mile and put some more effort into the presentation though.  Big thumbs up on the beer selection. So all in all I would give this place a solid four stars. Again, it's an all around safe bet, for someone looking for a place to have a good meal in a nice atmosphere."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Free skeeball and large versions of jenga and connect four out on the patio.

Wahoo's fish tacos and Gatti's pizza is in walking distance should you get hungry. DO note that the console/sit down video games on the north side have literally dozens of classic games to choose from all inside one cocktail table style cabinet, SWEET! Free play on all video games all day Sunday and $1 mimosas makes for a crowded but fun Sunday afternoon. Interior decor is awesome with a pixelated Chuck Norris greeting you as you enter and space invaders within the bricks between the entryway and the outdoor patio. Bar staff is always timely and polite. Pickle shots were delicious! We had shots of Tito's vodka followed by shots of pickle juice and it was badass except it left us all with some funky breath.

Which reminds me, this bar has GREAT music! No pop band of the month bullcrap just good music both old and new on a great sound system that is not so loud as to prevent interesting conversations. Bathrooms are large, modern, and clean which is a nice change of pace from other places downtown within this price range. If you have a wheelchair bound companion they'll be right at home with the cocktail table style video games and a bathroom with enough room for handicapped folks to maneuver. Check out the hilarious adult things written on the outdoor Jenga games, some of them are bizarrely hilarious! Many of my friends and myself go here for birthday happy hours and we are always well treated and they are willing to reserve tables if you call ahead with an approximate number of guests.

The atmosphere and menu are the same, but this is more of the 'have margaritas with your dad before a show' crowd rather than the 'hipster college kids that don't care the margaritas are weak' crowd at the other location. I appreciate the more 'refined' crowd and that the tables do not feel as crowded. However, this location is just as loud as the other. You can't talk to the person across the table or even order from your server, disappointing. I tried the special - a watermelon margarita. Very delicious but like my last experience, too much ice and not enough Tequila. Now I know to order a beer or don't drink. Tried the queso with the corn in it - super creamy and delicious but I would have liked more of a bite to it. I am not a fan of spicy food and would never put hot sauce on anything, but this could have used a squirt or two. Since this was our second visit to a Condado, my husband and I knew that the chicken had zero flavor and that the best bet is to order of the pre-made taco menu. My favorite is one with the hard shell taco covered in the soft shell with queso and quac plus the beef with all sorts of veggies and salsas on top. I tried their 'mild' sauce and it was way too much for me. I will stick to just a salsa to add flavor next time. I also ordered a side of quac for $2 to go with my taco and it was the perfect amount to spice up my taco and use my extra chips with. Note: I love their guac but my husband wanted to try something new and ordered queso, so I just needed a nibble of guac. The side portion was perfect. Overall, I was more satisfied with this trip because there was more space between tables and we knew the best taco combinations.

The tacos have anyway. Based on this encouraging trend, I am compelled to dish them out an extra estrella. \\n\\nBut why, you may be asking, why go back here \\"over the years\\" as you say? The answer is simple: \\n\\n1) My wife likes it. I freely admit she calls the shots. \\n2) It is the only taqueria near my house (there was a Muchas Gracias on the other side of town for about 8 months). There are a couple Mexican sit-down-and-be-waited-on restaurants here, but no other raw, get-in-and-get-out joints. \\n\\nSo, back to recent visits. I stick to the tacos here as I don't care for the beans they pack their burritos with. The tacos should have more cilantro and onions, but they have a ton of meat and tomatoes, so I can deal with it. They use two tortillas as the base. The carne asada and shredded beef that I had tonight are quite enjoyable. Both were perfectly cooked and had the nice salty flavor I go for. In the past, the chicken and carnitas seemed to always be dry, so I didn't bother with them tonight. Maybe I'll give them another shot next time. \\n\\nMy wife, or boss, as I affectionately call her, likes the machaca burrito, and I think it is pretty good but far from the best I have tried. I really don't like their al pastor and advise you try something other than that.

Add one tablespoon of oil to a non stick frying pan and put the frozen dumplings in so they don't touch each other because the dough is sticky when they thaw.   It will take about 45 minutes to thaw.   Add 1/2 cup of water, cover (leave a small gap), and put over moderate heat.  You want the heat high enough to boil the water off in about 10 minutes.  Don't uncover, poke, stir, etc.  When the water boils off, fry to the desired crispness.\\n\\nFor the dipping sauce.  3 tablespoons of soy sauce.  2 teaspoons of Chinese vinegar (I like Chinkiang from China Merchandise in Burlington),  a little sesame oil, and a clove or two of minced garlic.

But I was assured by a friend not to worry because somehow it kinda works. So I persevered for, you know, science, and stuck with the attitude of \\"I love burgers, and I love sushi. Hopefully this won't disappoint.\\" With a touch of, this is so crazy it just might work. \\n\\nLet me add, this friend that reassured me is one of those that doesn't eat anything green and usually washes every meal down with a giant Mountain Dew. \\n\\nIt turns out my worries were right, this restaurant is the epitome of why people hate Americans. Why would you have burgers and sushi in the same place? Why? WHY? City walk has a sushi restaurant and a burger place... Pick one. Not both. It doesn't make any logical sense. Guy Fieri  definitely had something to do with this. I just know it. \\n\\nGod only knows what the eff is going on with the atmosphere of the restaurant. For instance, in the bathrooms this weird soundtrack that is obnoxiously loud plays with a bunch of nonsense. A manager described it to me as \\"A redneck who is being translated into mandarin. It's a funny, quirky thing our owners thought was fun. \\" So, ok the logic I see going through this owner's mind is; \\"Sushi is Japanese, which is Asian, so it must be cool to put Chinese sayings in there right? Why don't we go ahead and put some Korean writing on our walls too. Look at that! Asians are so cool with their funny writing.\\"\\n\\nThe fact that this place doesn't even make any sense was the least of my worries. It took 30 minutes to be seated, and the restaurant wasn't even close to half capacity. It was a Saturday night and there was a very large line that followed us. Our server was rushed and running around like they were slammed, my assessment was she was assigned too many tables. Bless her, she was sweet and I cringe at the thought of having to work in this monstrosity. Our food came out right at the 40 minute mark (now we have an hour 10 invested in this place) and the burgers were cold. Like, maybe they had been sitting out for, oh... 35 MINUTES. \\n\\nThis is where it gets interesting: some mid level douche manager with a Disney villain looking goatee came over and basically made excuses and accusations towards our our sweetheart of a server's issues. I quickly assured him it wasn't her fault, he should know... She's not cooking this food. He came back with two plates that were a touch warmer. At that point we just wanted to get out. He had excuses, not explanations, nor apologies. He then never came back to follow up, and he kept giving our waitress dirty looks and stern talks that were clearly stressing her out. \\n\\nAfter an hour and a half, we got a 25% discount. Not an apology and we were told \\"Well food times take a while, it is Saturday night you know.\\" Yeah douche goatee. We get it but your silk flame shirt of a restaurant is nearly empty. Plus my food can take a long time, or be cold. NOT BOTH. \\n\\nHis actions were a slap in the face and dishonorable to my family. Guy Fieri would be appalled, and he would have probably given us some sweet apps.*\\n\\nThe food... Was mediocre. It's why I gave two stars. It wasn't terrible, but it's certainly not worth the price. I'd say it was comparable to an Applebee's or a Chili's. And the sushi was weird. It, flavor wise, didn't really make a lot a sense and ironically was oddly warm. Seriously, who's controlling the temperatures in this place? \\n\\nHeed my advice, unless you're a frosted tips Fieri loving gastronomic socio-path... Stay away. Eat a burger, or raw fish. Not both you maniacs. \\n\\n*We talked with a general manager, I believe his name was Rajiv. He was awesome. He apologized for the gap in communications and douche goatees actions.

I am a mac n cheese-aholic and I loved it here :)"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The Screen Door is located on East Burnside at 24th Ave.  While there isn't any dedicated parking, there is plenty of parking on the street in all directions.  We had to go about 3 blocks to find space for a very large car at 10:30am (on a weekday), so I suspect finding street parking wouldn't be too difficult most times.\\nThere was a 30 minute wait when we arrived (with a party of 4).  They had some seating outside, and i think coffee may have been available while you wait (a few people were wandering with mugs) but a coffee station wasn't immediately apparent. \\n\\nThe dining room is large with a variety of seating options, from bar seats and booths, to standard tables (4 seats).  If you have a larger group, they'd likely just push a few tables together.  The space is kind of tight between tables, so if you need a highchair or space for a wheelchair, be sure to mention that (as they may be able to find a spot with more space).\\nFrom the dining room you get a really cool view into the kitchen, which is located on the far side just beyond some curtains that are pulled back.  The decorations are minimal, but have that 'country kitchen' kind of feel (think pickle jars and such).\\n\\nThe menu is a bit a overwhelming (for a number of reasons).  First, they have a lot of options that span the brunch theme.  But so many things on the menu look REALLY good.  To me, I'd rather bring 6 friends and have everyone order something and push it in the middle.  That may be the only way I'd get to try enough different things.  Otherwise, you'll need to make a number of trips to try everything.\\nOur server said that if there were some items she'd highly recommend, it was the chicken/biscuit sandwich (I think), the chicken and waffles, and the praline bacon.  I appreciated the suggestions, because it really helped us focused what we'd have.  Here's what we ordered, and my thoughts:\\n\\nFried Oysters - These were pretty straight forward.  Cornmeal dusted and fried.  Good oyster flavor, tender, but easily cut and eaten with a fork.  The tartar sauce was good, nothing unique.  \\n\\nBreakfast Hush Puppies - These were unique, and definitely worth ordering again.  Think hush puppies, with bacon and cheddar.  But with a semi-sweet glaze on them...not heavy at all, just present.  They were served alongside a syrup that was very interesting.  It had an almost barbecue sauce flavor, with a hint of tobacco.  I know that sounds weird, but it was very good.\\n\\nPraline Bacon - I think this came with three or four very large pieces.  The thing I'll say about this: it's very rich.  We didn't need as much as they brought, and took most of it home.  If they'd do a single piece, that would be enough for each person to have had a square of, and it would have been enough.  It's also not crispy (at least ours wasn't).  The bacon had some bite to it, but it had a lot of grease, and was heavily laden with pecans.  I think I expected it to be more crisp, but the fact that it wasn't didn't ruin the flavor at all.  It has a sweetness, but isn't candied the way you may think.  But again, it's very heavy, so plan to share or ask for a 1/3 order.\\n\\nBiscuit w/meat gravy and an egg - This was really good.  Egg was obviously straightforward, but the gravy was fantastic and the biscuit was a perfect compliment.  If you added a fried chicken breast, this would be heaven....well, a heart attack, but in a good way.\\n\\nChicken with Waffles (3 breasts) - I totally get why this is so popular.  I'm not a fan of chicken and waffles, at least it isn't something I seek out.  But I split this (the three chicken breast version) with two other people, and that was the right decision.  The fried chicken is fantastic, but those chicken breasts are LARGE.  So getting the three breast version means you better have some people ready to help, because it's too big for a single person.  No matter how many breasts you get, you only get a single waffle.  The breading is super crisp with a good bite of black pepper.  The waffle was fine, but I've never been a big fan of waffles in any form, so I can't really offer a good assessment.  To me, the chicken was the standout.\\n\\nMimosas - They were tall and tasty, it's smart to drink early in the day.\\n\\nCoffee - It was strong, black, and bitter.  I was happy.\\n-----\\nI'd definitely come back here, and would love to do so with a larger group of friends (that are willing to share).  While the fried chicken was the absolutely star of this meal (to me), I think I'd take a more traditional breakfast direction next time and do fried chicken with biscuit and gravy, they'd all go together so well.  All of the sides we had were also great, and I'd really like to try more of them.\\nThe service was also extremely friendly and helpful, and that means everyone that helped us and especially our server (Brooke).\\nI usually don't do 5 stars on my first visit (preferring to go a few times and update if the experience remains excellent).

There are only three booths and if you want one, you'd better be standing out front when they unlock the doors at 5:00 PM or you'll certainly be out of luck. Then, your options are to either sit at the bar or perch at an obnoxious bar table six feet in the air - the choice is yours. If cougar-hunting is your sport, then load up your blunderbuss because this is the place for you. The desperate and ready-to-settle crowd has got this place all staked out. By the time you hear a Baby Bash ring tone or detect a waft of P. Diddy Unforgivable - look out - they've probably already got you surrounded! Anyway, the bar food is super. We swear by the burgers and fries - much more food than anyone can eat in a sitting - and the beef stew. We've seen the meatloaf on other tables and it looks amazing, but we have never tried it. The martinis are always filled to the brim of an over-sized glass. Wine is poured generously by the glass.\\n\\nThen, there's the dining room. It may be cougar-free, but the oldsters can be equally obnoxious if you find yourself among their tables in a room that can be surprisingly loud. We've had some really good meals in here, from the filet mignon to the duck duck goose, etc. We've had the fondue a couple of times. There is always plenty of good food, but there are some clunkers on the menu, too. For example, the baked apple with bleu cheese was conceptually interesting, but the flavors just didn't work like we expected. Their signature approach seems to be their wood-fired grill. Honestly, sometimes that wood-smoke flavor is something we crave, but at other times, the smokey flavor can be overwhelming to the palate and/or overmatch the food we've ordered.\\n\\nAs for dessert: hunka hunka chocolate love. Demand it.\\n\\nAnd, the pre-app focaccia is pleasingly salty.\\n\\nBoth in the bar and the restaurant, the staff has always been great. We've always found the service to be sincere, orderly, and attentive. As for price, you may find that you've spent $8- $10 more per person than you would at Soma, Mandrake, Tryst, or Chianti.

The original comes with pork belly, egg, and wood ear mushrooms in the ramen. Each element really blended the flavors together, and truly belonged, as against being an afterthought that got tossed in. The biggest fan of course was the kiddo, who usually expects all noodles to be expected with meatballs, but made a significant exception for ramen.\\n\\nWe also ordered the spicy edamame - perfectly balanced in spice/tartness/salt, brussels sprouts - tasty, a mix of soft and crisp, and reminiscent of the crispy brussels sprouts at Salty Sow.\\n\\nI think the only downside of this restaurant is the lines. Similar to certain popular burger places, it has a two line system - one outside the door, and one inside to order when your table is ready.

I really appreciated that thoughtfulness.  The atmosphere is relaxed and casual and it's clear that very high quality ingredients are used in the food.

Another favorite of mine is the redfish; it is one of the best fish dishes I have had in my life. My friends love the brioche dessert; it is fun and tasty. I love their naughty fried chicken, too. Their crab soup with gnocchi is divine--so rich and buttery, such a decadent treat! \\nMettle has an extensive wine list, and you can get bottles within quite a good price range, and they have selections from the older vineyards as well as the new world vineyards. El John Selector from Thievery Corporation has been spinning there on weekends--now that's cool. I love the decor and the overall posh but relaxed vibe of the place.

The burgers just tasted better and nicely sized, and, as noted, all ingredients, including the bun, just seemed very fresh compared to what is offered at FG. And the fries at FG, which, when served to me with a paper bag, were notable mostly for the large grease spots on the bag.

I had the Beachcomber's Punch - taking a chance, since I don't like absinthe or anything anise flavored. It was the right choice - there was a small hint of anise, but it was a well-blended cocktail, and the flavors all complemented each other well. My boyfriend had the Masala Seas, and it was frothy and creamy.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, our server was quite helpful in explaining the meal. We were brought picked green beans while we waited, and they were divine.

When I realized I was eating the fatty part and the second half of the sandwich was made with leaner beef which was kind of dry and chewy, I was a little disappointed.  If you do come here, get an appetizer - the tominator (fried tater tots with melted cheese and other goodies) is the BOMB.  Even the fried pickle chips (normally not a fan) were pretty on point.  I do think it is somewhat disappointing that I was more impressed with Fox Brothers' sides than their actual BBQ.  Shouldn't the focus of a BBQ joint be its bbq and not the appetizers/sides?  It's not hard to make something taste good after you dunk it in full grease and make it crunchy, but truly juicy (yet not overly fatty) and flavorful meat should be the standard at any bbq restaurant.  The second time I came I ordered the chicken salad sandwich with fried okra.  Both were pretty good, but it was certainly nothing jaw dropping - they definitely give you a good helping of fried chicken, for sure.  \\n\\nOther things:\\n- Parking here is out of control.  People double and triple park like it's no one's business.  Your best bet is to park on the side street (kinda residential) and make the short walk.  \\n- This place is always packed!  Weekday lunch, weekend meals, etc.  Be prepared for a wait.\\n- One of the people who recommended me to come here said that Fox actually smokes its bbq, which apparently is rare these days.  Not being a bbq fanatic, I don't know how this exactly factors into the analysis, but you can definitely taste the smoky flavor."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good tapas place, ok priced.

My mother, son and I had lunch at Franklin on a Wednesday around 11:30.  I had scheduled the to go option weeks prior to our visit.  I highly recommend you take this route.  They only have so many spots available, so plan accordingly.  You are required to buy at least 5 pounds of meat, so you will be out at least $100.  They take a $75 deposit when you order and you pay the balance upon arrival.  I was really glad we took this option, the line was about 35 or so deep when we arrived, and still was 15+ deep when we left.\\n\\nWe had a time slot of 12:00 - 12:30.  If you miss your spot you lose your food, I think you have a 15 minute leeway period.  So, make sure to be on time.  I was early by about a half hour and the woman told me they would be able to fit me in.  The to go location is a trailer behind the restaurant that is shaded and has porta-potty plus a couple of picnic tables to sit at while you wait.  I had my food by 11:50.  I asked where we can go to eat, as you are NOT permitted to eat in the to go area.  They are very clear on this and it is advertised prominently.  The woman told me there was a park about a block away that has picnic tables.  She said we would probably be eating with other people that had Franklin.\\n\\nWe drove to the park, and sure enough, 3 guys were finishing their BBQ as we drove up.  So, perfect timing.  We had, in my order of preference (deep breath):  brisket, ribs, sausage, pulled pork, turkey.  For sides I ordered cole slaw, potato salad, and beans. Unfortunately the beans did not make it into our order, and I did not realize this until we arrived at the park.  This was annoying but not catastrophic.  Had they forgot the brisket, that would be another story...\\n\\nThe brisket is probably the best I have ever had.  At worst it's top 2.  We got a pound and a half and I immediately regretted not getting more.  We easily had enough food for another couple of meals, but I still wanted more brisket.  Frankly, had I only ordered 5 pounds of brisket, I probably would have been just as happy.  We had fatty and lean pieces, and all were incredible.  Franklin's rub is black pepper heavy, which I really like.  The brisket was incredibly tender and moist, even the lean parts.  Perfect smoke ring, excellent bark.  I don't know that you can get brisket better than this.\\n\\nThe ribs were large and looked like they were out of a food magazine.  They looked perfect.  Another general helping of the rub and the meat had a slight pull off the bone but was very tender.  Another A+ from Franklin.  The pork, turkey, and sausage were all strong, but could not compare to the brisket and ribs.  The sausage was very flavorful and had a nice snap to it.  It was not too spicy for my son, he is 7.  The turkey has great smoke to it and a lot of black pepper.  Excellent for sandwiches.\\n\\nThe sides were a bit more basic, but you don't go to Franklin for slaw and potato salad, you are there for the famous meats.  Served with white bread, onions, and pickles (plenty of each) it was just a fantastic meal.  We got a cooler from the nearby CVS and took the rest of the meal home to eat the next day.  The leftovers did not disappoint.\\n\\nI don't think I would wait 4+ hours for this food.  It was incredible but I don't think it's worth that.  So, on future trips I will definitely utilize the to go option.  Made getting this iconic food a lot easier and everyone I dealt with from Franklin was super friendly.  This place is as good as advertised, the hype is warranted.  Can't recommend the place enough, but it takes some planning beforehand.\\n\\n[1,000th Review]"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I decided to try out this place for dinner by reading other people's review.

We were expecting good things when we saw that it had been awarded best Chinese restaurant by Creative Loafing and that we were some of the few non-Chinese people dining.  \\n\\nWe had a seat at a nice booth.  After reviewing the menu, we ordered the potstickers and the soup with \\"preserved vegetables\\" and pork.  We asked our server for recommendations - a mild chicken dish and I told her that I wanted a beef dish that was very spicy.  We ordered her recommendations - the broccoli chicken and the \\"spicy sa cha beef\\", which is actually what I was thinking about getting anyway.  \\n\\nThe soup came - it was a basically a simple broth with clear vermicelli noodles and a few bits of pork and that preserved vegetable (no idea what that was).  I wasn't a fan of the soup and would not recommend it.  Very shortly after the soup we received our main dishes.  They brought the entrees out pretty fast, which normally isn't a problem, but I had eaten probably half of my main dish before they brought out the potstickers.  Appetizers should go before the main dishes.  Duh.  Not a big problem though.  \\n\\nWhat was more of a problem was my \\"spicy sa cha beef.\\"  The greens and beef were pretty tasty, but the dish did not even have a HINT of spice to it.  None.  It could not have been milder - it was on par with the broccoli chicken (which was excellent by the way).  I'm not sure if they screwed up in the kitchen or what, but I specifically asked for a very spicy beef dish and that is not even remotely close to what I got.  When I told our server, she didn't seem to care and was a bit confused when I asked for some chili sauce.  I think the dish could have been great if it was actually spicy as was advertised, but instead it was just good (though a little boring).  \\n\\nThe potstickers were fantastic when they finally came.  Probably the best potstickers I've had ever.  I believe they were steamed and then very briefly pan-fried. The filling was really tasty and the dipping sauce was also easily the best I've ever had.  I would have liked them to have been pan-fried a little longer to crisp them up a bit more, but they were superb regardless.  I would go back for those alone.  \\n\\nOverall, there were some problems (\\"spicy\\" was incredibly mild, late food), but the good far outweighed the bad.

The mussels had about 9 mussels total, which is a disgrace if you ask me, and means that each mussel was over a $1 each (price was $13).  Most places in Boston give you a nice big pot of them.  Also there were only 4 shrimp in the BBQ shrimp, and they weren't large shrimp either, and also does not match the price paid for them.  Also all the food is extremely rich and over the top; they don't offer any sides or vegetables aside from the 2 salad options.  But the main reason for the negative review is this weird situation we had involving ordering one of the soups.  So I asked if I could get the crab soup (can't remember exact name) without the \\"tapioca balls,\\" which I don't like and are an odd thing to put into soup (or at least I think so), and they said they could accommodate this.  It took about 20 minutes for the soup to come out, and it comes out halfway full.  When I inquired about it, I was told that I asked for the soup \\"without\\" the tapioca balls and so that's why there was less soup...like they were too cheap to have just filled the rest of the bowl with broth.  Also, I highly doubted that the tapioca balls could have displaced that amount of soup, since it was pretty significant (like half the $8 bowl).  I said if that was the case then I didn't want it.  The waiter said he would take it back and see what he could do.  He came back with the same bowl of soup and said that \\"they\\" refused because \\"that is the portion without the tapioca.\\"  I again said to take it back, as it's not like I was asking to sub the tapioca balls with crab or something expensive - for $8 I just wanted a full bowl of soup.  Then about 10 minutes later the waiter returned with a full bowl of soup and said \\"they agreed to fill it,\\" which was highly suspect - they wouldn't do it initially but now want to get the $8 for the bowl of soup that has been shuffled back and forth to the kitchen for the last 15 minutes.  I still said to forget it out of fear there was possibly something done to it during that time.

Did they kids care that the food was bad?  No.  Our children are 5 and 7 and although my 7 year old did not finish her food because she didn't like it, my 5 year old did not finish his food because he was too into the pirate show to eat!!  Some of the reviews are accurate - the boat area does smell bad, like mildewed water I think.  But we go over it.  This is a tourist thing, not a local thing.  It isn't going to be a well rounded wonderful and Disney-esque.  But it has pirates and princesses and sword fighting and a dragon....they just loved it.  And maybe it was because it was a weeknight/slow, but all children in the audience were able to get on the boat as part of the performance and at the end, the children were also able to surround the boat and help capture the princess.  Our kids were so happy the not-so-good meal was at the bottom of my list.  I came here for my kids and left here glad we went....dining was not the purpose of this evening.  There was a small dance party with the pirates after the show which was fun as well - nothing fancy but an opportunity to dance with pirates?  My kids were in!!  And the cast was very kind and interactive.  4 stars because I do think the food could be better, even with mass production, but it is not enough to keep us from coming back if our kids request to do so.  And it would be good if the moldy smell was gone (but once the food came/guns fired it was unnoticeable); however, if you have allergies this may be something to consider.

The one knock i have on the brisket is the flavor.  Franklin rubs their brisket right before smoking.  I've never been a fan of that since all of your seasoning just sits on the outside.... let it sit in the fridge after being rubbed for like 16 hours and you just increased the flavor profile greatly.\\n\\nThe ribs and sausage were smoked well and were seasoned well.

Prior to this place, I thought that Roscoe's in LA had the best fried chicken/waffle combo. The Screen Door blows Roscoe's overpriced menu away as well. You get a lot for $12.95. And the sweet potato waffle is the perfect compliment. Its my first time trying it and I'm hooked. \\n\\n2) Fried Oyster Benedict\\nI was intrigued with the oysters/egg combo, so what the heck. Though they only added 4 oysters, they were bomb (crisp and juicy). Poached eggs over huge pieces of biscuits can be shared by 2/3 people. Somehow a mistake just ordering this for myself. \\n\\n3) Breakfast Po-Boy\\nA yelp recommendation that did not disappoint. The andouille sausage was another first for me and it was spicylecious!. For that southern feel, I got this with a side of grits. Once again, try to share this among 2/3 people. The sausage comes in a hefty serving. \\n\\nAs you can see, all of the items were shared among 4. Alot of leftovers, but definitely worth trying all items. Servers were wonderful. Crappy wait, but definitely worth it if you're ever in the Northwest."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There's a reason why this place is busy day in and day out.

I personally wasn't so much a fan of the decor but that's not what the review is about. We sat in the dinning area at a booth. They had white paper over the table cloth, I assume to keep it clean, but apparently that didn't help. My side of the table cloth was caked in something brow, I'm assuming chocolate. My small salad plate also had food caked on it. Not appealing at all. The glasses looked dirty too. We were soon checking the silverware laughing and joking that those are likely dirty too.\\n\\nWe had sat for only three minutes when we were asked if we were ready to order. The waiter came back three minutes later to ask if we were ready yet. He seemed really impatient to take our order. Of course after we told him no twice it seemed to take him forever to finally come back.\\n\\nWe ordered our lunch and martinis. I had the seafood newburg: Saut√©ed Prawns and Scallops in a Lobster Cream Sauce. My friend had the Parmesan crusted halibut. We placed our order and I don't think it took 10 minutes before the food was on our table, it was amazingly fast. My plate had three large scallops, three large prawns, a perfect formed scoop of rice, one whole crawfish, and it was all swimming in lobster sauce. There was soooo much sauce and nothing to soak it up with. The entire meal was luke warm too. Not pipping hot or steaming. I also found the lobster sauce to be almost too sweet tasting. The scallops them selves were mushy. I was expecting melt in your mouth like butter scallops but I got mush. It was pretty bad, so bad that I ended up leaving one left on my plate. I had only two of the shrimp too. The rice was also mushy like it had been sitting in a rice cooker for far too long. For $34.95 I expected a lot more. I kept trying to eat my meal, because my friend was paying and I felt horrible not eating it since it was so expensive, but I finally just had to stop. It was pretty bad. I didn't even eat the crawfish because I was afraid it was going to be just as disgusting.\\n\\nThe reason I'm giving the place two stars instead of one is because my martini was really good!

When I first moved here (like everyone else in Portland, I moved here; if anyone tells you he was born here, he's lying and is just trying to trump your cred, possibly so you'll buy him a beer; anyhow, point being, I've been here longer than you; yes, you, personally), I don't recall anyone arguing about whether restaurants on Foster were overcharging or deserved their Bon App√©tit mention.\\n\\nBut along comes Bon App√©tit with one of those ridiculous articles that are completely pointless because, what, you're going to travel to Woodmere, Ohio to try a burger from one of \\"The Top 10 Best New Burger Spots\\", whatever that means -- as if the writer had even attempted to sample all the burgers from the latest hamburgeries across the nation, much less in the towns bordering, say, Woodmere, Ohio -- and, long story short, everyone gets their shorts in a wad.\\n\\nI mean, isn't it nice that there's a good burger joint serving good burgers on Foster Road (aka \\"The Sandy of Southeast\\") and ... what's that? Bon App√©tit? Top 10?! No. Freakin'. Way. And suddenly, no one's rating this place in terms of -- allow me to belabor the point here -- hamburger joints in Lents. Oh no. Now that precious Internet rating is in terms of whether it lives up to the hype of some phoned-in list in a Cond√© Nast publication. Well!\\n\\nSo does it deserve the Bon App√©tit mention? Who knows? Like the rest of you using the Internet to find restaurant reviews, I don't read magazines, much less ones that publish articles purporting to tell me whether a restaurant in my town makes it into some mythical national pantheon, even and especially if I'll never patronize the rest of the pantheon.\\n\\nHere's what I know: I shouldn't have gotten my burger to-go. Or, at least, I should've arrived a few minutes earlier. My fault. I was surfing the Internet. You know how that is (yes, you, personally; don't pretend you're not reading the Internet RIGHT NOW). So some of the fries were a bit cool. And the burger, while warm, was past that gloriously fresh stage everyone back in the restaurant was likely enjoying when the plates hit the table. Oh well. I have a son whose bed time is before my dinner time. Some day I'll actually eat in a restaurant again.\\n\\nAnyhow. Forget Bon App√©tit. Was it good? Yeah. Cooked to order (medium rare, of course). A darn fine bun. Tasty bacon (don't fool yourself, you can screw up bacon; they didn't). And a fairly inventive, if subtle, secret sauce that, as I remember it from when I phoned in the order, contains Japanese mayo, Sriracha, dill, and, uh, other things. Was it all good? No. I just laughed at the white slab in my to-go box where the lettuce was supposed to be. Four stars, though.\\n\\nPerhaps more to the point, was it worth it? Well, that's why I went with three stars in the end. With bacon and cheese (and, forgive me for sounding like a Neanderthal or Internet meme slave, but my burgers are always gonna have bacon and cheese on them), my burger cost me $10.50. I did not eat a $10.50 burger, though I wouldn't have blinked at maybe $7. I mean, in case I hadn't mentioned it before, the restaurant IS on Foster Road.

I've always liked hamburgers and am always on the lookout for the great ones, but I've had some time on my hands and decided to try three new places this week. I tried Violetta, Joe's Burger and now - Foster Burger. \\n\\nWhen I walked into this place, I knew I was going to like it.  It's in an old beat up building, a bit dark on the inside, but once you walk in, the staff is friendly, welcomes you and you can start to take in the character. Band and music posters covers the walls, other strange knick-knacks scattered about.  If any place is going to have great burgers, it would look like this. \\n\\nAnd I wasn't disappointed. I think I found it. One of the great burgers in town!!  I got their basic Foster Burger, double-patty and had them add a small pile of blue cheese on top. That, with their special sauce and the lettuce and pickles, made for quite a treat. \\n\\nThe meat - really tasty meat with the distinctive, strong beef flavor that I love. But here's what sold me - they season their meat. Yes! When I take a bite, my lips, then my tongue hit the seasoning, and flavors start dancing in my mouth. I ate a small bit of the meat alone, by itself and it was damn good. \\n\\nThe bun - I rarely comment on the bun. It's an integral part of the meal and if it's bad, I'll say so, but most places I've tried, the bun doesn't stand out. Here at Foster Burger, their buns are fantastic. Soft, grilled on the inner surface, fresh and chewy and truly tasty. I snagged a piece of the bun and just ate it.. really a fine piece of bread on its own.  And spongy - I love this - I would not have been successful at getting my mouth around that first bite of this huge burger, if the bun did not squeeze down under the pressure of my fingers and lips... but it did... it squished down wonderfully, and I got a delightful mouthful of meat, bun and fixings. Perfect!! \\n\\nThe wet naps - oh yes, when you sit down at a table and notice a container full of wet naps, that just tells you the owners know something about their burgers - you are going to be one sloppy, juicy, wet mess when you are done.

There's a New Orleans voodoo tang in the atmosphere, but they play fast and loose with it. The roasted oysters with spinach were delicious, and served creatively on a bed of salt. The raw bar is very petite, not a hangout spot. But the actual bar is nice and tall with plenty of chairs, a great room for drinks, and their drinks are creative. I had the Gris Gris, which wasn't sweet at all and had interesting ingredients like falernum and coconut. My husband had the Hurricane (definitely a Tiki theme worked in too), which came out glowing pink with a cherry, and he loved it.\\n\\nThe biscuits are a bit much: huge, soft, sweet, pillowy, but the pimento cheese accompaniment tasted just right. We had duck drumettes, they were melt in your mouth and had a decadent mix of fat and acid in the rich marinade. The boneless chicken thighs are a bit lighter than the 1/2 chicken, and the crunchy batter is eccentric but interesting. There's one rub and three BBQ sauces, and they will give you all four but I had the sweet and tangy on my chicken and forgot the rest. It was a little confusing to know what to order out of the mix of plates, as the chicken was the only clear entree but the tapas (Tiki Tapas Southern Voodoo Fusion?) were different sizes, too. You have to be a bit adventurous to venture through the menu. \\n\\nFor dessert we tried the beignets, which two out of three of us liked (one thought they were still raw).

They've got small wineries from all over this area for your tasting, for your buying, for your amusement and pleasure from the get go.  There are numerous options for tasting different wines. They also bring in winery folks (guests) that will do the pourings and go into great explaining of what their grapes are all about.

There was not a bite that was not enjoyable and intoxicating also.\\n\\nThe reason I could not give this place a 5 star is the space itself. It was super busy and you really had to pay attention to them so that you could choreograph the visits to the table.  The servers danced in and out to try and get everybody on board and engaged but sometimes it was just impossible.  There are only about 4 tables and one of my pet peeves is when a huge party comes in and basically just monopolizes the rest of the place.

This trip, however, we stayed for close to a week so we had time, and so planned to go.\\n\\nYesterday we still weren't sure ... I mean, waiting in line for 4 hours?  I'm sure it's great, but is any food THAT good?  Yes, friends told us.  And yes, the locals told us.  It will be worth it.  So we finally made the decision we should.\\n\\nSo here we are today, a Thursday.  We arrive at 9:15am and are about ... 100th in line I would say.\\n\\n100th in line.  Clearly a lot of people think this place is worth the wait.\\n\\nAt about 9:45 an employee walked around to ask what we would likely eat in order to let people in line know if they were getting food or not.  We were told we would get brisket, but don't get our hopes up for ribs or pulled pork.  Additionally we could plan on eating at 1pm.\\n\\nYup.  In total our wait time would be about 4.5 hours.  In 40 degree weather.  Does this BBQ come with a side of Pappy?\\n\\nFast forward to 1pm (yup, her time was accurate).  They are out of pulled pork (again, she was accurate) but had ribs.  The misses and I ordered brisket, ribs, and a sausage link.\\n\\nAnd folks ... it's worth it.  \\n\\nIt's worth 4 hours.  \\n\\nIt's worth 40 degree weather.  \\n\\nAnd it's worth the ensuing food coma that further takes up your day.\\n\\nIt's worth it.\\n\\nThe brisket was silly good ... melt in your mouth delicious.  They offer 3 types of sauces but God this meat is so good i'm not sure you need the sauce.  The ribs were huge and meaty, and equally fantastic in taste, as was the sausage link.\\n\\nAnd as many people have noted the Bourbon Banana Pie is divine.\\n\\n4 hours.  4 hours of your life.

I ordered my food togo online (bonus points for the 15% online order discount), and it was ready by the time I arrived about 15 minutes later.  I ordered (for two people) the veggie samosas, the chicken curry, and the chicken vindaloo.  Personally, I only had the vindaloo and the samosas, both of which were quite good.  The veggie samosas were a little smaller than what I'm use to seeing, and werent as crispy, but they still had good flavor.  Both of the sauces that came on the side were very nice as well.  \\n\\nOnto the vindaloo.  I am a HUGE fan of spicy food, the hotter the better for me.  I had selected the \\"very hot\\" option when ordering online, and while it wasn't as spicy as I had hoped, it still carried a decent kick.  The overall flavor was amazing, every bit as good as I had hoped for when I read other reviews for this place.  There was a good mix of chicken and potatoes, and all of the flavors and spices were in good balance.  One key for me was that the chicken was very neatly trimmed, which has been an issue for me over the years at various Indian restaurants, but no problems here.  I would very easily order the vindaloo again.  They supplied us with more than enough rice for the two of us, which came in handy because I wasn't going to let any of that sauce go to waste.  All in all, I was very pleased with my first experience here and I will definitely go back next time I'm craving Indian food.\\n\\nOne other detail, and this is in no way a negative thing to me, but it is a bit of a hole in the wall.

Now THAT was working for me. They say it's crispy, and they do deliver. That's some serious crispiness their batter delivers.

My brother and I walked by one weekend night at 1:55am, and debated going in for a burger. Unsure if they were still open, we stood there awkwardly for a minute before one of the waitresses lured us inside. Unfortunately, despite her invitation, we walked up to the bar only to find out from the bartender that they were no longer serving. They did give us each a coupon for a free burger, though, so kudos for that.\\n\\nA couple of weeks later, we finally had time in our busy schedules to go back. My order was quite simple: I just wanted a bacon cheeseburger. My brother (the Michael C. who also reviewed the place) ordered one of the fancy burgers on the menu. We also got a basket of fries and a couple of Bud drafts. The beers were alright, but weren't big enough to warrant being served in mugs. I'm pretty sure the regular glassware at some places is bigger than the mugs here, but maybe I'm just spoiled by the huge beers at the Pour House. The fries were sub-par, but I prefer shoe-string fries like uburger's.\\n\\nMy burger showed up with no bacon, which wasn't a total travesty. I waited a couple of minutes for the waitress to come back (there was a food-runner, so she wasn't even the one who dropped off the food), but she never did. Eventually I just ate the burger without bacon, but when I finally flagged her down (with 1 bite of the burger left), she said I should've told her. I would've, lady, but this is the first time you've been within 10 feet of our table since you took our order. The free burger coupons implied that we should've paid for the add-ons to our burgers, but the burgers were entirely free (either a function of the coupons that we misread, or comped as a result of the bacon blunder).\\n\\nThe food was a 3, the service about a 1. Tasty Burger is way closer, but I'd rather walk to uburger or even Burger King before going back. Tasty Burger should be called Pricey Burger or Mediocre Burger."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The wait is well worth it.

Didn't care for the sausage (perhaps I couldn't get over the knowledge of there being organ meat within it), the ribs were quite tender but not a lot taste but the pulled pork and brisket were great with the turkey being excellent.  As some Texas BBQ places shun sauce, it was surprising to see 3 different sauces on the table.  One of them was very dark, and I've been told it's an espresso sauce.  Whatever it was, it was good.

The chicken was cooked to perfection -- crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the honey sauce added the right touch of silky sweet goodness. \\n\\nI'm very sad, however, to report that I couldn't sample the collard greens, which I adore, because they were prostituting themselves with bacon. The good news is that in the half hour I was there, another gentleman inquired about bacon in the greens and walked away disheartened, so maybe they'll fix the recipe.\\n\\nIn lieu of greens, I had some really good onion rings. Same peppery cornmeal breading as the chicken, cooked to excellent crispness without being at all burnt or dry. A little greasy (the chicken wasn't greasy at all), but hey, these are onion rings...\\n\\nAs for the fried Oreos, well, it's a good thing I had already ordered and paid for them, because I really was too stuffed to do them justice. The order includes four, which should serve four people really nicely. I ate two, mostly out of sheer determination and stubbornness, and they were very sweet and very doughy. Not bad, and worth the sampling, but I wouldn't get them again. For one thing, the flavor of the cookie gets lost in all that fried doughy batter. The chocolate sauce and candy bits were a very nice touch, however... And I did suggest that with Valentine's Day coming, it might be worth frying up a Hershey's Kiss or two, maybe the ones with caramel in the middle?\\n\\nFinal comment: I overheard from another table that the meatloaf sandwich was also very tasty.\\n\\nFinal, final comment -- Ugly Banjo's is in a cute parking lot with tables in the middle and a half dozen other food trailers, and I look forward to going back and sampling some of the other offerings.

Full disclosure, I hold a serious soft spot for dives, and Bono is the quintessential dive pizza joint.  The term gets thrown around a lot, so I should clarify what I mean here.  Run down location? Check! It's stashed in a side room off a convenience store. Slightly sketchy? Check! It can be hard to figure out which door to go in- one back door leads you behind the counter and literally face to face with their custom built brick oven. Casual atmosphere? Check!  Bono has just about two tables, so you pretty much have no other choice but to rub elbows with the staff and owner (who's usually the one working the oven).  You can even step behind the counter and watch your pie cook.  I suggest taking your pie to go if you're not in the mood to be friendly or \\"shoot the shit.\\"  They foster a bit of a Cheers-esque atmosphere here, which is really my favorite part about the dive feel.  I like having a go to neighborhood joint where I feel relaxed and welcomed.  \\n\\nFinally, and it's a testament to how much I enjoy the atmosphere that this part is only getting mentioned second, but their food is incredible. They use fresh ingredients, and when cooked in that aforementioned oven, produce the perfect pie.  Their dough is made each day, and their closing time is based on when they run out.  I know people who have brought their own toppings, and the staff accommodate enthusiastically.  I enjoy myself a greasy slice of pizza as much as the next gal, but there's something to be said about eating excellent food that makes you feel like you're still being kind to your body.

We had read about Chef Gita Kantrow and were curious to see her takes on traditional Nepali cuisine. We ordered the 5-course tasting menu. \\n\\nCourse 1: Momos. This is an Indian take on Chinese dumplings. Filled with minced pork and seasoned with an Indian flair, and with the dumpling shell steamed to a bitey-chewy texture. They were served with a savory tomato achar, a spicy chutney of sorts. Rich tomato and smoky finish of the achar complemented the momos beautifully. \\n\\nCourse 2: Cabbage rolls. Chef Gita's take on the Polish galumpki was well done. The use of lentils in the filling and the masala-spiced tomato sauce that bathed them was a nice riff on the original. The tomato sauce was a bit dry, but otherwise flavorful. \\n\\nCourse 3: Coconut curry haddock. A fusion of typical South Indian fish curry with American elements - delicious and perfectly cooked and bathed in a rich coconut sauce resting atop a pillow of turmeric mashed potatoes. Accompanied by two perfectly stewed tomatoes that added a bit of an umami bite and a gentle heat to the sweetness of the curry. \\n\\nCourse 4: Butter chicken masala. The most recognizable contribution of Indian cuisine to the world, Chef Gita kept this one pretty close to the original. Topped with a crisp, spicy cauliflower saut√© and resting on perfectly cooked basmati rice, the chicken was fork tender and moist. The sauce had a slight sweetness and a creamy richness that played well against the gentle heat from the masala. \\n\\nCourse 5: Gulab jamun Marscapone cheesecake. What else do I need to say there? Holy sh*t - never thought gulab jamun could get better. But there it is. \\n\\nIn summary, the tastes and flavors remind me of what my mother cooks at home and that is about the highest compliment I can pay Chef Gita."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you watch cooking shows, you might catch a scene where someone's homemade food is compared to a frozen comparison and then blind taste tested. \\n\\nWhile eating at the Screen Door, I easily imagined enjoying food that was made from being frozen to be better.

The lean brisket is very tasty even though I usually prefer moist.  The moist brisket is ridiculously decadent and frankly one of the best things I've ever tasted.  Sometimes you can take a slice and spread it over a piece of bread like butter.  \\n\\nThe ribs are good.  Pork. Tasty.  Above average.  I'm not much of a rib person, can you tell?\\n\\nThe pulled pork is really good, and it's my wife's favorite.  Aaron dumps the pork in a small amount of sauce and lets it sit for a little bit before serving which really enhances the flavor. \\n\\nSpeaking of flavor, i use 2 sauces (i know, i know, sacrilege).  The espresso is unique to Franklin and doesn't take time to get used to.  The sweet sauce is equally as good but for whatever reason I prefer the espresso. \\n\\nIf you're going by yourself, I'd recommend you ask the cutter to give you a little bit of everything and forego the sides (potato salad, cole slaw, or beans).

So instead we ordered a strip steak med-rare that came out medium, lamb chops rare that came out med-well, and two fisherman platters that we're almost 1/2 fish and very little of the other items. The batter on most of the items was wet inside meaning it was not fully cooked. Manager tried to tell us that the food steamed each other and that may have been why it was not crisp.

Read so many astounding reviews on this place so we decided to try it.\\n\\nFood was ok. We ordered the 7th trimester - very dry. It's literally a biscuit sandwich with egg and bacon. The Mac and cheese on top tasted like plain pasta. Expected much more. The pimento and bacon sandwich on sourdough was much better though. Fries come sprinkled with parmesan cheese on top.\\n\\nThey don't have Pepsi or Coca-Cola. They use a brand named Stubborn. I am all for supporting small companies and brands. However, they should have a backup for those who don't like trying out new things as simple as soda. \\n\\nCinnamon bacon rolls are only baked in the morning. They make a limited amount for the day. I think it's a bit ridiculous, they'd definitely make more money if they actually had it available at all times. Instead they suggested I come back between 10 and 11 am go assure I get one... not happening.\\n\\nTable lay out is poorly designed. Long tables to share with others. Usually not a problem. But they have an L shaped table in the corner so if you have people sitting on both ends, it's quite inconvenient to get to the middle. Table is against the wall so you have to ask others to get up for you to slide by to get to the middle.\\n\\nThis place was fine I guess, but I can make myself a better brunch and save the time standing in line outside."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"It's inside the universal city walk.

The shrimp in my appetizer was perfectly fresh and succulent, his crab gratin was buttery luscious, served with grilled toast-yummy.

The waitress decides to tell me to give her a minute. The first time she said so, I gave her time but she became too busy waiting on other tables that she forgets me and my friend so now we are pretty pissed. But next, she decides to change her shirt behind the counter and then points for us to sit down at a table. Like why didn't she do that in the first place?

This is the best fried chicken, period.  The exterior was perfectly seasoned and had a great crunchy texture. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful.  The collard greens were very good.  They were cooked with plenty of bacon, and cooked just long enough to retain some bite, and sat in a slightly sweet, vinegary broth.  The mashed potatoes were good, but why waste the calories or the tummy room? My eyes were definitely on the prize, but I ended up bringing home 1/2 my dinner.\\n\\nThe hubby had the Screen Porch Plate (you pick any three sides and comes with a slice of cornbread).

I'm ashamed to say that I've lived in Portland for seven years and had avoided Jake's up until now. Why? Who the heck knows....just didn't appeal to me with all of the other options in town. I should have trusted my subconscious as this pretty much sucked. \\n\\nTo start with, the wife and I sat in the bar and had a cocktail. With a youngun' and all, we don't get to have grownup discussion without a little voice butting in constantly so we were content with the old-style atmosphere of the bar. So, we waited maybe fifteen minutes with our drinks before we were seated - a good thing. We got seated at a decently appointed table. As I looked around, I could feel the age of the restaurant. Not a stuffy/historic age as much as a worn down kind of age. Then, I thought, \\"Well, maybe this is one of the landmarks that just stands on its reputation alone - one of those places where the food speaks volumes and the atmosphere is just the stage for the entertainment.\\" Wrong. \\n\\nService was good. We were first struck by the lofty prices. I get it - seafood is expensive, but sole, no matter how it's prepared, should not venture anywhere near the mid twenties (It's a damn bottom-feeder for Pete sake!), but it was one of two chef's recommendations so the wife was hooked. I opted for the scallop sautee which seemed awfully expensive, but I took the bait because the server said that all of their sautees were very good. We had the popcorn shrimp appetizer which, I know, is a bit of a copout at a nicer restaurant, but we fairly enjoyed it nonetheless. We split a house salad which was neither remarkable nor terrible. Our main courses arrived and looked appealing, but the flavors of both dishes were off. When I say off I mean that the wife's sole had no flavor which is a travesty considering that it was parmesan crusted and was recommended by the chef. My scallop sautee tasted like smoked bacon, sitting in melted butter. Gross. Sure, there were tomatoes, scallops, mushrooms too, but all I could taste was smoked bacon and butter not to mention that there was zero evidence of sherry in the dish as was advertised. Don't get me wrong - bacon makes everything better, but bacon does not make bacon and butter better. After eating as much bacon in butter as I could, I felt that gut-wrecked feeling that signals that I should have sent the dish back to the kitchen no matter how much I abhor that practice. I looked around us to see people eating fish and chips and burgers - maybe they already knew what I didn't - the fish is overrated which is exactly how I feel at....get ready for it.....McCormick & Schmick's which, it turns out, runs Jake's. BAMMO! There you have it. I should have known better - they're largely one in the same seafood outfit.\\n\\nIn retrospect, this may have flown as a touristy spot for folks looking for the old Portland experience, but this, unfortunately, was my first/last. There are far too many great restaurants in town where I can burn as much cash or less and ensure an excellent meal and experience. This isn't it."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Alden & Harlow exceeded my expectations. I came here on a Wednesday night right at opening time (5pm) because I had heard about their secret burger and wanted to try it. We were seated in a section with tables around a long gray couch, a beautiful wall of plants, and a covered glass roof. The decor was fantastic. My only complaint is that I wish they played music other than rap and hip-hop over the speakers, which didn't fit with the rest of the ambiance.\\n\\nAll of the plates that we ordered were very good, and service was great. Our waiter came back to refill our waters 3 or 4 times throughout the one-hour dinner, and the food came out fast. We sampled:\\n\\n- Complimentary pickled green beans to start: an interesting alternative to the classic bread and butter starter. The green beans were heavily pickled, and the acidity was a bit overwhelming. Probably my least favorite part of the meal. \\n- The secret burger ($16): this is one of the best burgers that I've had in Boston - I like it better than the Craigie burger and the Radius burger. They only make 40 of these a night and sometimes they sell out by 6pm, so come early if you want to order one. The burger comes heavily seasoned with salt and pepper on a buttered and toasted bun, and covered with greens, pickled cucumbers, and a crispy wafer of cheese instead of your traditional melted cheese on top. The meat is very juicy and flavorful, and is perfectly complemented by the acidity of the pickled cucumbers. I also enjoyed the texture of the crispy cheese wafer, which added a crunch to the burger. The plate came with a generous portion of house-made chips. I normally prefer fries to chips, but these were fresh, crispy, and very good.\\n- Roasted bone marrow with parsley salad, candied walnuts, brioche toast, and salsa verde ($16): another wonderful dish. This came with three huge slabs of bone marrow and three heavily buttered toasted pieces of brioche bread. It is a heavy, decadent dish - you scoop out a fatty gelatinous spoonful of bone marrow, layer it onto the buttered bread (mmmm, fat on fat!) and bite into the greasy, artery-clogging heaven. I love how they add candied walnuts to the dish to add some texture, since bone marrow can get pretty mushy.\\n- Crispy berkshire pork belly with Anson Mills grits and grilled kumquat vinaigrette ($16): my favorite dish of the night. The pork belly is tender, fatty, and melt-in-your-mouth, while the skin on top is extraordinarily crispy. In fact, so crispy and hard that it is almost impossible to cut with a knife. The pork belly comes on top of buttery grits and a couple pieces of kumquats. The biting citrus of the kumquats is a welcome relief from the heavy fattiness of the pork belly and the buttery grits.\\n\\nOur waiter recommended that we order 2 dishes per person, but I was so full after 3 plates that we decided to forego dessert.

She came over and placed silverware in front of us. Mind you, there was clearly food on the counter that needed to wiped up. She acted as if she didn't see it and when we asked her to clean it, she just smeared whatever was on the counter everywhere. Back to the silverware... She kept throwing forks and knives in a cup behind her because they were dirty. The silverware she placed in front of us weren't clean either so she should've threw them in the cup along with the others. She walked away and came back 5 minutes later to take our order. She looked down at the silverware, grabbed it and took it away. When she came back, I asked if we could just have plastic silverware. She was then ready to take our order. But, before I could order, there was a roach crawling boldly across the countertop waving it's antennas as if it was waving hello. My eyes almost came from the sockets as I looked at it. She grabbed a napkin and smashed it on the countertop area by the plastic silverware she had given me. She then said, \\"getting on my nerves\\". Because she didn't put an address to her statement, I didn't assume she was speaking about us because we hadn't done anything to \\"get on her nerves\\". She then said, \\"I'm sorry! No, I'm not sorry for how these people keep their building\\". I then started to assume that they have a problem with roaches at that point. She then said, \\"let me clean off one of these tables so y'all can sit there\\". As she was cleaning the table, I tried to remain positive just because I wanted a waffle. My husband kept asking me if I was sure about eating here. I knew by him repetitiously asking me that question, he wanted to leave. I then told Ann that we were going to leave and dine elsewhere. She then began to say \\"I don't blame you. And y'all need to call corporate and complain and tell them about their bug problem and how dirty this building is. There's only so much I can do and I'm fed up with this place.\\" I just looked in awe as she was saying this to us. As bad as I wanted to tell her how lazy she seemed and how slow she was moving things could be a lot cleaner. I wanted to address her attitude, customer service skills and professionalism but didn't. I just shook my head and left. I took a picture of the floor behind the counter where she and the other employees have to work. There was standing water, food and trash all on the floor.

When I crave for ramen next time, I will drive 3 hours from Houston just for this place.\\n\\nBtw, the decor is fun and hip, especially the restroom painting."},{"name":"Shanghai Social Club","address":"1277 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has a nice ambiance. I came for lunch and I was the only person there so I can't comment on attire or noise level. Every table had candles and the chairs at the bar were placed diagonally which was a pretty neat attention to detail.\\n\\nThe food is not cheap and it's definitely not the best bang for your buck around. You really pay for ambiance which I didn't even benefit from because I took it to go. \\n\\nI ordered the General Gao's Chicken off the lunch menu for $9. It came with less than a chinese rice bowl's worth of rice and I thought they didn't give me any chicken but gladly it was buried under the rice. It came with an egg roll which was soggy and greasy.\\n\\nThe chicken was made from cubed breast meat. I think dark meat would have been better. It was barely battered and the sauce was very light. There were about 6-7 dried chilis in my chicken and it was more cumbersome  than spicy. The soy sauce flavor was strong but lacked the tartness most General Gao's have.  \\n\\nI wouldn't condemn this establishment. It really depends on what you want, authenticity and ambiance/ service don't normally go hand in hand. Joyful Garden and Jo Jo Taipei are awesome chinese/asian eats in Allston but I wouldn't take my group there for drinks.\\n\\nShanghai Social Club has a good vibe is a clean establishment. Given to the white meat and Meat to rice ratio on top of the americanized menu It definitely caters to a touristy view of asian food. It doesn't touch Chinatown quality with the lack of seafood, oxtail, lobster, etc. but it also lacks the fishy smelling entrance and tacky decor of your more authentic joints... And thats a good thing\\n\\nI'd call this place a trendy Allstonian PF Changs or Golden Temple. If you want my advice, take your friends to Peach Farm, Joyful Garden, Ga Ga Seafood, Jade Garden and finish the night at another bar or even this one that is if you are into trying real chinese food."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"Went the first weekend they opened. \\n\\nNo fountain Cherry Coke or Rootbeer.

Your server probably has to tip out everyone-Gauchos which there's usually about 4 or 5, and the bar tender even if you didn't order alcohol. Also, they will kindly take off the service fee if you ask them to. That way you can tip based off your experience and service. This is how we've always done it.

The rib meat was tender and flavorful but the top of the ribs (I don't know what you would call it) seemed over cooked and chewy to me.  My husband's brisket was cooked nicely but was way too salty, almost overpowered with salt. I got the Mac and cheese and fried okra side. Again, good but not great. So, I probably would give them a 3 on the food, but I had to give them 4 stars because the service was great. We didn't have to wait at all for a table and our food came out very quickly.

I appreciate her effort but unfortunately it wasn't the best that I've had, however it did satisfy my pallet and that was enough.  Really though, thanks to her recommendation of adding smoked gouda cheese to my sandwich, that was the star.  I had a Roasted Portabello sandwich, which they make with peppers, roasted eggplant Portobello, tomato, lettuce, sun dried tomato, mayo, feta, and saut√©ed onions.  The melted cheese with the saut√©ed onions blended with the sun dried tomato was a hit and the flavors just danced in my mouth.  \\n\\nIt's been so long since I've enjoyed a good lunch out on my own while soaking in the sun and enjoying all senses.

That's my thinking when I pick a restaurant name out of many that the Orlando Area has to sample. After I pick a restaurant, I check to see if the place does business with restaurant dot com and if it does, what does the fine print of the offer say and then, what do other Yelpers have to say? This place rated as plus, plus, and plus! It advertised itself as offering \\"Mediterranean\\" themed cuisine, it offered a $25.00 certificate if you spent $50.00 on food (should not be a problem since the on-line grilled entrees were priced at around $25.00 per dish), and many Yelpers had posted favorable comments about their experiences. Other plusses were that it was open late on a weekday night (10PM) and it was reasonably close to our timeshare condo at the Marriott. Sooooooo....off we go to sample Mediterranean eats at the Maraya. \\nIt was a rainy, cold miserable night and almost 10PM. I called to ask if they would serve us if we could get there at 10PM and the gentleman who I spoke with said sure, but then had the good sense to ask me where I was and if I liked Mediterranean food. We arrived at 10:15PM because the Maraya is tough to locate, even with a GPS. To my surprise and appreciation, we were greated warmly as we walked in the door with a plate of babaghanoush and pita chips. A nice touch! First impressions mean so much. We ordered the Kefta ($17.99) and the Filet ($24.99) and enjoyed both. Portions were fair.I downed 2 Lebanese beers ($5.00 each) and I wish I had noted the name of it. We split a Kenafa for dessert and it was delicious. My wife had an iced tea that she raved about. We were the only people in the entire place at 10:15PM until 11PM and we were never rushed or treated impatiently. In fact, Violette seemed genuinely happy to cook for us, even at the late hour. I deducted one star because it was my first visit and I need at least 2 visits to a restaurant before I rate it as 5 stars and also because we were never offered any coffee to enjoy with the Kenafa. Maybe because it was so late?\\nMe thinks that the Maraya is a great find and the $25.00 certificate took a lot of sting out of our bill, which easily met the $50.00 requirement for food.

I never even received my delivery!\\nI had just arrived in Austin and called Domino's to order a pizza to be delivered to my hotel room. After waiting on hold for 10+ minutes I spoke to a young woman to place my order. She put me on hold again to check if they delivered to my hotel. After she came back and assured me they do in fact deliver there, I placed my order and was told it would take 27-37 minutes. Fifty minutes later I called them back to check on my order. After being on hold for another 15 minutes I finally got an employee on the phone. He couldn't figure out what was wrong with my order, so he got his manager. She told me that they don't deliver to my hotel, so she had transferred my order to another location. I asked her to repeat the location several times, because I could not understand her and, since I am not from the area, I don't know any street names. After the third repeat she just continued talking, said goodbye and hung up. She was extremely short with me during the conversation; acting as if it was my fault they took an order they can't deliver. I called a few other pizza places nearby that sounded similar to the name she said, but none of them had ever heard of me. So, I called Domino's back again. After another 15 minutes on hold, I got the same employee on the phone and he gave me the phone number of the other location (the manager should have done this in the first place!). So, I called the other location. Of course they didn't have any such order in the system and by this time it was after 10:30, so I bought a granola bar from the vending machine instead. \\nIf I could give this place zero starts, I would. They shouldn't have taken an order they couldn't deliver; when they noticed the mistake they should have called to inform me; and finally they should have actually transferred the order like they said they had.

If a customer has a food issue, it needs to be addressed, not brushed away and told I could BUY something else. No manager came to see what was wrong or offered anything else.

TravelPorland.com listed a place called Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant, not exactly what I wanted but sounded good so off I went.  About five minutes away from my exit, I suddenly wanted Fried Chicken so I did a quick search on Yelp for soul food and Screen Door popped up in number place. I read a few quick reviews and decided to try it out. Pulling up to the restaurant I was skeptical. This didn't look like the \\"urban\\" place I was hoping to pull up too. I wanted some black eye peas, smothered pork chop, might even have some chitlin's or Ox tails on the menu!, you know SOUTHERN FOOD! LOL  The location was in a cute neighborhood and luckily I found parking right outside, which I have heard was a blessing! Open space and on a Sunday late evening the place was bustling. I was alone so I decided to sit at the bar. The host was extremely nice, sat me at the bar and gave me a menu. Looking around I didn't have much hope for the place. Frou Frou soul food, sigh. Oh well. The menu was small and limited but it all looked good. After wine tasting all day I was starving and immediately ordered the Shrimp and Grits for $9.75. Steep price for a starter, I thought. The bartender was set up right in front of me and was making impressive hipster style drinks. Instead of my standard Cosmos I ordered the Scarlett with tea vodka. Wow wee! Nice little drink, sweet but with a little kick! Things are looking up! Shrimp and Grits arrived shortly after. Impressive portion with 4 large size prawns......I could had it as a small entr√©e was my first thought. Nice presentation. First bite....warm fuzzy feelings and a smile on my face. Delicious! If I could have lick the bowl I would have. Soon after my entr√©e of Fried Chicken arrive with the gravy on the side as requested. I hardly ever put gravy on my potatoes or chicken so I didn't want it to be ruined. The portion was plentiful as the chicken is flatten out. First bite, I nearly melted out of my bar seat!!!!!! OMG! Crust was perfect, moist and season to perfection. The collard greens were like I make them and the mash potatoes were just dreamy. After a few bites I decided the try the gravy......SHUT THE SCREEN DOOR! It was so good I ended up pouring it all over my plate! That good.  So, I stand corrected and never judge a book by its cover.

Aside from that...\\n\\nThe bad.  Instead of listing this out, I'll just write how our experience went.  We walked in to the place and was asked to sit down.  Fair enough.  From there, a waiter came up to us and asked what we would like.  We were a little perplexed - what would we like?  We had no idea!  So we asked for some menus... and they said there weren't any menus but that they would have them in a couple of days.\\n\\nThat's OK... so what were our options?\\n\\nTwo things.\\n\\nA doner kebab sandwich or doner kebab meat, salad & fries.\\n\\nWe went for the second option.\\n\\nWhile we waited for our food to arrive, we asked ourselves, \\"How much will this cost?\\"  We had no idea.  Typical lunch prices in downtown Portland run anywhere from a hearty $5 special at a cart to 6 - 7 at other smaller restaurants along third / fourth avenue.\\n\\nSo our food arrived about 10 minutes later.  It took awhile, but I'll mark that up to being only the second day open.  The fries were fairly cold.  The salad that came with the meal was pretty standard fare.

Nice ambiance and nice & cool in there too.\\n\\n2)  The service left a little to be desired.

You might notice a few odd things about this place: They serve this stuff called Brunswick stew, which is a soup made of leftover barbecue, corn and vinegar. It tends to be sugary and vinegary. Georgians rave about it but then Georgian also think that grilling is the same as barbecuing. Also the sausage is a bit odd, it doesn't seem as dense or as smoked as the sausage you'd get in Texas.

A corn dog that is a frankenstein monster assembled of an Italian sausage, a hot dog and a kielbasa.  They also have the option of doctoring your corn batter with either jalape√±os or cheese - I opted for the cheese.  This was so rich and delicious - but the corn dog was so much food! With the 3 different meats, it was a lot! Next time, I might get the plain corn dog just to compare.  Their house mustard is grainy and tart - but the perfect match.\\n\\nAs for sides, we went for the mac and cheese, which has so much cheese and then they go overboard and top it with crushed cheez-its. Is it possible to have too much cheese? I think this may have been it.  Also, we ordered the fries topped with poutine - I'm a sucker for a good poutine and this was classic and hit all the right spots.

We also bought two additional cupcake flavors when we were there, but that caused us to get a duplicate, the red velvet - of course. :(\\n\\nThe sample box itself was made of plastic (as were the individual cupcake containers) instead of biodegradable or compostable materials. We are particularly sensitive to this since we are trying to have a green wedding. :(\\n\\nWe didn't schedule a meeting since shamane said she was busy, but she came out to talk to us when we were there. :) \\n\\nWe asked about doing something pumpkin flavored out of season, and instead of just saying no, she offered to use canned or frozen pumpkin :( I bet she was just trying to give us options in case we absolutely had to have pumpkin at our wedding, but I would have preferred that a baker try to talk us out of doing something that might not live up to their standard of quality.\\n\\nThe cupcakes themselves were also not great. They weren't bad, but they didn't live up to our expectations. We had everyone in my fiances family help us with tasting, but no one was very impressed.\\n\\nThe chocolate chocolate one was very dense and heavy. There was so much cocoa in the cupcake part it tasted almost bitter like dark chocolate, but the frosting wasn't sweet enough to balance it out. On its own the chocolate frosting was also light on chocolate. Everyone disliked this one, but for different reasons.\\n\\nThe lemon cupcake was okay, there was a nice sour center of lemon curd or the like. I thought it could be more sour, but another of the wedding party thought it was almost too sour. Though this was several peoples favorite, we were all talking about the lemon in the middle, no one noticed the cupcake or the frosting.\\n\\nThe red velvet (as previously stated, bride and groom's least favorite flavor) was almost nondescript and didn't leave much of a memory. The one comment I heard was that the cream cheese flavor in the frosting made the frosting a smidge too tart.\\n\\nMy favorite was the carrot cake. I love carrot/zucchini/pumpkin/veggies in my baking, so no surprise here. The crowd had the same comment about the cream cheese frosting in the carrot, but I quite liked the cupcake, though I would have preferred more spice.\\n\\nOne star for the turkey sandwich we ordered for lunch, which was actually very good.  Another star for the lavender rose lemonade, which was fabulous. :) The third star is for the blueberry rhubarb tart we also picked up while there.

A friend and I like trying different restaurants and tonight I suggested Serafina.  We were on time for our 7:30 reservation and were warmly greeted by the hostess, who immediately seated us at a cute little table for two.  The gorgeous dining room is huge yet welcoming and cozy.  The decor was subtle and classy.  We started with the Charred Octopus and the Burrata.  Both dishes were amazing.  My friend said, \\"this is hands down the best octopus I've ever had\\" and I totally agree with him.  It was cooked to perfection with the couscous complimenting it perfectly.  The prosciutto was delicious as was the fresh ball of mozzarella on top of it.  A perfect start.  Next we had the Tuna Carpaccio.  It was a beautifully designed dish that we felt bad cutting in to!  We took one bite and were in heaven.  All the different ingredients went together exquisitely.  Just the right hint of everything.  And then came the Tartufo Nero pizza.  It looks like a simple white pizza with a few mushrooms on it.  One bite in and I was blown away.  The cheeses blended together with just enough truffle oil.  Not overpowering at all.  Every bite was delicious....I couldn't get enough.  Surprisingly we had room for dessert and had the Creme Brule.  Very yummy and a perfect size for the two of us to share.  My friend said it best about the entire experience...\\"every restaurant has a theme. . . this restaurant serves just the right amount of subtlety that unexpectedly blows you away\\".  \\n\\nTo make our experience even better was the staff.  From the nice hostess to our attentive waitress, everyone was great.  A special mention has to go out to the manager, Jackie.  A pretty blonde girl who was bouncing all over the restaurant making sure everything was running smoothly.  As busy as she was, she took the time to come over and ask if everything was OK and chatted with us for a bit.  Such a pleasure!\\n\\nWell done Serafina!!  We cannot wait to come back!!"},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"232 Ne 82Nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"My portabella mushroom hamburger was very good, and very small.

But, if you go, be prepared for VERY slow service, and a subtle rip-off.  Not many people know that Mellow Mushroom has a lunch menu, with lunch specials.  Yes, that's right!  They do!  But the trick is that you have to ASK for the lunch menus - they won't give them to you unless you ask.  My guess is that they're trying to get you to pay as much for your meal as possible.  But, the dinner prices are way too expensive for lunch, especially when you compare the cost of lunch at other competing restaurants.

The filet itself was delicious and cooked to my liking. The vegetables that surrounded it were good, but were more fitting for pot roast. \\n\\nDessert: Chocolate cake and ice cream. This has a fancier and more detailed name, but right now it escapes me. The small portion on this was perfect since the cake is so rich. \\n\\nOverall, the food was very good. \\n\\nService:\\nThe service here was very good.

The order for our dessert went to our server and was delivered quickly without a hitch.  The water lady brought crayons for my son who was busily drawing in the candlelit atmosphere which seemed to have a comfortable volume.  \\n\\nOur cake was reasonably priced for how huge it was and we enjoyed it very much while watching the table nearby receive the same cake with a candle on top.

Yesterday we were seated for brunch, then our waitress eventually came over, and then 25 minutes later we had to flag her down to ask where our food was.  When she came back from the kitchen without our food, she essentially yelled at me that there wasn't anything *she* could do, the food would be out.  Sorry!  Ummmmm, there's a whole bunch you could do.  You could stay on top of our order, you could seem sincere when you have customers who have been delayed so long that one of them misses their connection at South Station, you could provide service.

You order at the counter as you come in and then try to find a seat.  The food then comes to you.  As a first time visitor it may be a little confusing but it actually works quite well.  All the sides come seperate from your ribs or other entree. Everyone who ordered ribs loved them, while my daughter got a quarter smoked chicken which she still raves about.  The ribs have a great flavor already but you are given sauce on the side to further tipping.  This sauce is very sweet and strong but I really enjoyed it. The full rack was really big and most people will probably be satisfied with a half rack, especially if you want to enjoy some sides as well.  The sides that we got, however, were really nothing special.  There was a band playing blues even in the early evening and although it added to the atmosphere it also made seating that much more difficult.  Probably great for most patrons but made things a little frantic when trying to find seats for younger kids.   Of the places we ate in Atlanta, this was my favorite.

Glad we ordered two for our party of four. The tender burger (still a mystery) included a brioche bun and a thin, crispy layer of Parmesan. Our little plates each outdid one another. The roasted cauliflower with peanut and siraccha sauce was incredible, as were the fried pork rinds and lonza, pine nuts and cherries.

Not only did they have a comprehensive GF menu, but the waitress was also very knowledgeable and even asked us a few additional questions that made me feel very confident that she was looking out for us.\\n\\nService was not fast, but not too slow.  We didn't have the negative experience in terms of lengthy waits for food that others have seen.  And it was pretty full in the restaurant.  Our waitress was surprisingly good with our kids.  \\n\\nThe pizza was good, specifically the toppings.  The GF crust was fine.  I've had better, but these kind of crusts are definitely hard to make so I'll give it an OK.  The salad was actually good, and the apple-wood bacon on top was legit.  \\n\\nThe restaurant's downside is that it didn't seem very clean.  I doubt the food prep areas were dirty, but this place had a lot of stuff on the floors.  I think having a bunch of college kids working at any restaurant might yield this type of cleanliness with out tight supervision."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I was hoping Yelp would be wrong about this place's rating, but unfortunately, it's pretty accurate. The food was overall a huge disappointment. Nothing was horrible, but nothing was very good either... We started with the buffalo tofu strips. The tofu was breaded, fried, and tossed with buffalo sauce. I expected a somewhat crispy exterior, but it wasn't at all. My friend equated the dish to the texture of a Mexican cheese. The buffalo flavor was prominent and tasted good, so it made the overall dish fine, but I think that's just because buffalo is such a strong and intense flavor. For mains, we wanted to try the famous burgers, so we had the peppercorn burger (dry), veggie burger (dry and bland), and the catch of the day, which was a lobster gnocchi (meh). The fries that came with the burgers weren't even very good--they were kind of limp and needed seasoning/salt. I enjoyed the scene of Christopher's and really wanted to like it (they have a great menu), but I would not go back because the food is just not great, though their prices kind of reflect that I guess.\\n\\nNext gripe is about the wait times. To be fair, we came on a Friday night, around 8pm; it was crowded. We were initially told it'd be a ~30 min wait. Okay. We were actually seated about 5 min later, which was awesome. Once we sat down, though, it took forever to just get drinks. The bar was apparently very backed up. It also took awhile for our food to come out. \\n\\nThere is only street parking in this area and it can be very hard to come by. Christopher's is located right across from the Porter Square T stop, though, so that's convenient for those who use public transit. There IS a large parking lot across the street that is for a bunch of stores. You're not *supposed* to park there, but that's what we ended up doing.

After unfortunately confirming with the server that they no longer carried their yummy crispy-tender wedge fries, I ordered the beans and mac-n-cheese sides. \\n\\nWhat landed on our table was barbecuic blasphemy. At first I thought it was a crab cake on my bun, but no, it was a lump of masticated beef--well, more like somewhere between chewed and the other end of the digestive tract. Good lord it was horrific. The mac-n-cheese was grainy and flavorless, though thankfully the beans were spicy and smoky. I complained a bit to staff about the mac-n-cheese but was ignored. I was so disappointed as I'd been a regular at Stubb's for so-so but not-to-far barbecue in the past. \\nSummary:\\nWorst\\nQ\\nEver."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My go to happy hour place.

She doesn't care about the environment of the restaurant or even the morale of the customers. So she makes herself at home and doesn't bother to talk or help. Scowling and talking bad about the customers in Spanish aren't going to make the people happy either, but she honestly just doesn't care. The food is alright, I love Mexican food so I'll eat it.

I love NY style pizza. To me, that's just pizza and everything else can go by a different name. So I expect a lot from my pizza. Bambinelli's definitely met and surpassed my expectations. \\n\\nWhen you walk in you can tell it's a family owned restaurant. Pictures of friends and family line the walls and you get a great homey feel. Combined with the amazing smells coming from the kitchen, I was in heaven as soon as I walked in. \\n\\nWe started off with their homemade meatballs as appetizers. They were great. Great meatball, great marinara, and a great price. Also, they give you complimentary bread with your meal. The bread is pretty much a garlic knot, and they were awesome. After our meatballs were gone they were the perfect way to enjoy the rest of the marinara. \\n\\nWe got a XL pizza with half pepperoni and it was great. The thing was massive. Really just huge, and I was in love. A lot of times when you get pizza, especially with pepperoni, it's very greasy. Bambinelli's pizza wasn't greasy at all and it blew me away. The pizza was great at the table, and was enough to serve as my lunch for the next two days. For the price, definitely get the XL because it's just as good cold or reheated as it is when it first hits the table. \\n\\nWhat really made our trip great was our service. Our actual server was ok, but a guy who worked in the back kept coming out and talking us and helping out. He had short dark hair, a goatee, and was wearing a ballcap. He may have been an owner or a family member, but I don't care. He really put Bambinelli's over the top. Due to his interactions with us, Bambinelli's is going to be our destination any time we want pizza or pasta when we're in ATL.\\n\\nNext time I'm down I'm coming for some chicken Marsala so it better be up to par with our first trip!"},{"name":"Magnificent Muffin & Bagel Shoppe","address":"1118 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Hands down the breakfast sandwich around!

Be it fine wine, a single malt scotch, a diamond or in more relatable terms a marriage.\\n\\nOften when dining, I will find menu items that include the abbreviation BBQ.  It is essential to understand this is not only a method of saving money on print but is a direct indication of the Chef's understanding of the process. A process that can never be abbreviated.\\nThe word \\"Barbecue\\", which many etymologists believe derives from the Caribbean word \\"Baracoa\\"- the European translation for this is \\"Sacred Fire Pit.\\"   If this sounds overly turgid, consider for a moment the hours, and in some cases days, it takes to cook brisket properly. Make no mistake about it. We are talking about ritual. A sacred ceremony performed dutifully by the men and women of Franklin Barbecue. They are doing something sacred. Something that takes time to cultivate- to perfect. \\n\\nThe word genius has been bandied about during my generation in the same way \\"awesome\\" has been used to describe leaf blowers. Mr Aaron Franklin is not a genius. Steve Jobs is not a genius. They are craftsmen. They are artists. We've degraded the term and the idea of an artist in this country. Neglecting the intellect and bravery that goes into any new endeavour. Franklin is an artist. He is without peer, at this moment- his moment, at the top of his game.\\n\\nJust know that to \\"go to Franklin's\\" is to attend a master's workshop. To be in the prescience of something special. A rarefied artist that sadly deals in a perishable medium. \\n\\nThe handmade paper sign outside, like much of the indoor signage, clearly and ominously lays out the challenge - 11am-Sold Out!  The beauty of this is the recognition of the business of slow cooking meat.  It is near impossible to predict how much product that takes the better part of 24 hours to produce one might sell. So what most restaurants do is cut corners in the cooking methodology to hedge against having leftover product, not Franklin.  Here product and quality trump serving the masses. It is my understanding that they cook to capacity but when it is gone- it is gone for the day. All the while they continue to prepare the next day's banquet of Brisket, Pulled Pork, Turkey, Ribs (Pork and on Saturday's Beef) and Sausage. The result of this philosophy is a product that is all about quality. Make no mistake the quality we are talking about is HIGH. This business model does create a level of exclusivity. Those in the know- know the goods will be gone.  This knowledge (read abject fear) of the possibility of not being served causes people to line up hours before 11am in hopes they'll have the privilege to spend $17.00 a pound on a masterfully prepared meat product.  Don't bother showing up after 9:30 am\\nIn short, we're well past short at this point; Franklin Barbecue succeeds in doing it right. They take the time, and it is worth the time to wait. This place deserves a Michelin review- it is that good."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good food and great drinks.

All of the dishes got really high marks from everyone at the table. The standouts were the caramelized cauliflower side dish, the fried chicken, and the caesar salad with walnuts and pecorino. The entrees were all predictably well-cooked, flavorful, and fresh, but the sides really made the meal stand out.

It reminds me of being at a baseball game. The dog is perfectly cooked, the bun soft, the cheese sauce and topped with FRESH jalapenos.\\n\\nFranksgiving: Only available during Thanksgiving time, this Dog though looks unappetizing is the exact opposite.  A perfectly cook dog on a soft bun topped with mashed potatoes, gravy and stuffing. It is like a Thanksgiving meal on a single bun. Yes I know you are already saying that sound bad, I though so too, but I tried it and was BLOWN AWAY by the flavor combos. Job well done on this creation.\\n\\nDoginator: Bacon wrapped Hot dog! Sign me up. Not only to we have a perfectly cooked dog but it is wrapped with bacon which is also perfectly cooked, smothered in coney sauce and shredded cheese. This beast of a dog is not for those watching their waist line but like all the dogs here, it is nice to your wallet and dynamite to your taste buds! \\n\\nPretzels, Dirty Sancho and Fried leaks: The pretzels are under cooked, but that is the way I like them. Soft pretzels for me should still be doughy but have a tough but not crunchy shell. Dirty Franks delivers this texture perfectly with their soft pretzels which are served with both a sweet and savory sauce which fits any mood.\\n\\nThe Dirty Sancho may be listed as a side but it is far from it. a HUGE bowl of mac and cheese topped with bread crumbs and jalapenos, this monstrosity will meet the high expectations of any mac and cheese freak! And the best part, IT ISN'T EASY MAC! \\n\\nFried Leaks are something many people don't know as most folks see a leak as something for a soup. Dirty Franks takes this very healthy green, drops it in some batter and fries it. Though I feel the leak has a little too much moisture to be friend and it is apparent when you eat them as some pieces the breading is falling off and other pieces are dry, i give them props for attempting it and making the best out of it.

It's deep-fried so if you are avoiding this kind of food, you've been warned, but really, it's not oily at all! It came with a sweet, chili sauce to dip in and as a whole, it was pretty good. I'd rate the dish as a 7/10.\\n\\nThe next dish up was the Tibetan dumplings called Momos. It comes in Chicken, Beef, and Tofu/Vegetables. We chose the chicken version and it didn't dissapoint! The skin was not too thick, all handmade and the chicken meat was nicely done. Served with ginger, you should use the pickled chilies and chili paste that's on the table to dip with. So good!! 8.5/10!\\n\\nOur two main dishes were the Vegetable Then-Thuk (Thick handmade noodles in rich soup) with waterchest nut, daikon, mushroom, and cilantro and the Beef Phing-Sha (vermicelli) served with Tingmo (steamed bun). The noodle soup broth was infused with intense flavours and the noodles had the perfect amount of chewiness to them. They weren't the long style noodles but rather the hand chopped variety.\\n\\nThe Phing-Sha Beef was also good, with a bit of a orange taste to it. It was served with the Tibetan steamed buns, which were huge, but you can also order it with rice, but come on!

It had a nice, firm texture (3.5/5.0).\\n\\nSalmon Eagle Eye ($2.95) was on their special menu on the day. It's a cute little item you can try out as an appetizer.

It is basically the deep-fried rice topped with cucumber, avocado, masago and chopped spicy tuna & salmon, drizzled with spicy mayo and unagi sauce.

I was the one egging us on to go there tonight.\\n\\nWhat I didn't expect was that there would be pretty much nothing on the menu that wasn't fried. Even some over-boiled corn on a stick would have been a relief to the menu. The only side on the menu that wasn't fried was the mac & cheese and the pickle. So I ordered a corn dog and a pickle. They were out of pickles. Sigh. I ended up with the basic corn dog and an order of tots for the table. The corn dog was good. The tots were just tots, nothing special. My daughter doesn't like hot dogs (Crazy for a 5 year old, I know) and she got the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese wasn't as good as I would have expected. So she ended up having fries and a shake for dinner, then an apple when she got home. The other two adults we were with had rubens, which did look good and they enjoyed them. (Some reviewers said they were small, but these were not, so perhaps they've adjusted based on some of the other reviews.)\\n\\nWhat I'm left with though, is a stomachache. Like a lot of folks in the area, we normally have a pretty healthy diet. I hope this place will learn to balance their menu a bit. I don't think a huge salad menu or anything is required, just something to cut the grease.

Staff seem a little confused, or at the least very sloppy. My order got messed up even though I was watching them make it and letting them know when they reached for the wrong cream cheese. Staff seem disorganized and overall the process wasn't very orderly. It wasn't too busy when I was there but I wouldn't want to be here if there's a line. I also feel like the bagels here are often weirdly flat or deflated a lot of times.\\n\\nThe coffee is awful. I don't understand how coffee can both taste watered down and also kind of burnt and overdone at the same time, but this Bruegger's manages to do it. \\n\\nI even prefer the Bruegger's on Washington Street over this Bruegger's - the other one is at least more spacious and cleaner. At the least, I don't feel like Washington St. Bruegger's skimps out on the assembly. The other day coming here my salmon sandwich had exactly -one- slice of salmon in it.

My personal favorite were the pork ribs! Melt in your mouth. No. Joke.!! \\n\\nMy favorite part of the entire experience was the fact that the staff at Franklin's looks out for their customers. We witnessed a man arrive at 10:45am, (right when everyone was putting away their chairs and closing in the line ready to go inside), find a temporary gap in the line fairly close to the front so he hopped right in. Shocked, I thought- what a total **** move! Then, said guy waved over 4 of his buddies and they hopped in line. Wow. Douche! No one said anything to the group of guys and they were behind me so I didn't either, but I was irritated at their rudeness/selfishness. They made it in with about 15-20 min to go to the counter to place their order when the lady who had taken everyone's order several hours before while we were all in line noticed unfamiliar faces she had not spoken with earlier.

It was expanded a year or two ago, but still isn't large, turnover is quick due to the grab a plate ethic, and you can always grab a to-go container.  And as has been said, I haven't seen a per pound price listed, but my bill was always reasonable, so I never asked, but they should put one up for the complaining contest eaters on this Yelp blog.\\n\\nTo the annoying diners of the world ---This isn't \\"Fine\\" dining, so don't go there to get a mani-pedi experience, French gourmet food, or plate presentation.  To the connoisseurs, yes I would like to see them carry Skol,  Brama and native staples at the taps, but I know distribution of those in this country is not wide spread.\\n\\nTIPS - It can be cold near the door in winter, you may see a Brazilian tv feeds (this place is called taste of brazil!), and you will likely need to park in the municipal lot and walk the 30yds.  \\n\\nIf my kids weren't a restless 1 and 4, and my wife was a little more adventurous, I'd be there ALOT :)"},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is terrible.

Sonsie does a fabulous balance between a sexy cocktail venue and an upscale, reasonably-priced dining destination with a thoughtful menu. \\n\\nI love how the oval tables and their seats are facing the open windows; the front of the restaurant reminds me of sitting in a quaint european bistro. \\n\\nThe menu is an excellent array of choices.  There is a perfect amount of starters (and not your usual list of fare- they've got tuna sashimi, assorted olives, confit duck wings, etc.) \\n\\nThey've got unique salads, perfect-for-one pizzas (try the Goat Cheese pizza with kalamata olives-yum, yum! ) and their drink menu has a great list of wines, cocktails and beers with standard prices for the area.   I was less-than-in-love with their sangria, but for my second round, the glass of sauvignon blanc hit the spot.  \\n\\nWhat I'm most impressed by is their entree menu- they've got some of the best fish dishes  I've seen at any restaurant on Newbury Street.  I'm a big fan of restaurants that give a variety of different fish dishes on their permanent menus, because it entices me to try some that I haven't yet.  And I love a good filet because I always finish feeling pleasantly full, flavored, and guilt-free.   So Sonsie does a good job with presenting dishes like bronzino, halibut, salmon, and a market fish of the day.    They've also got excellent pasta dishes- my dining partner had the papardelle with wild mushrooms, meatballs,  pomodoro, and arugula, and I got to steal a bite.

The food and atmosphere have always been enjoyable.  After a bit of a hiatus, I decided to come in the other night for dinner.  What on earth happened?!?!\\n\\nFood 1/5: Johhny Cakes weren't freshly friend.  Crab cakes were soggy and soaked in oil.  Curry was so salty I stopped after half of it.  The side of coleslaw was glistening with oil.  It was worse than cafeteria food.\\n\\nValue 1/5: Can't talk value when food is awful.\\n\\nAmbiance 2/5: Weekend dinner hour and the place was pretty quiet.  What used to be a pretty popular place for the 20-30s crowd has transitioned into a place that looks like it's frequented by tourists and families.  That is fine, but not quite what I was expected.  Very uncomfortable chairs.\\n\\nService 3/5: One of the servers seemed a bit curt with us, and I wasn't sure why he seated us at a lousy table (by a service station) when the restaurant was pretty much empty.  We did ask to move, which he accommodated.  The other server was fine.  She came to check on us after the appy arrived, but at that point we hadn't concluded that it was very poorly done.  At the end of our meal, she came by again and asked how things were and we told her that things weren't that great.  She handled things well and said it'd be helpful for us to let them know when things aren't right.  Point taken, but this was just one of those situations where I felt things couldn't be remedied.  With most dishes made in advance, it wouldn't have been possible to alter the oil or salt content.  Also, having to wait while another meal is prepared sucks when you're hungry and when you're dining out with someone else -- you're both eating alone, and how fun is that?!  They were gracious enough to comp the dishes we complained about.  \\n\\nOverall 2/5: This restaurant is past its prime it my books.

Last night SUNDAY 12/19/10 I was craving for some fried clams and slaw etc. and CHARLIES came to mind  remembering how tasty their food was, I got on Facebook and ordered a medium size clam basket, fries,& slaw, for delivery. I was told the price for the food and $3.50 for delivery and approx 40 minutes to wait.  The order showed up earlier than promised, piping hot and plentiful.  I spent the best part of $30.00 and gave the driver a generous tip and wished him a MERRY CHRISTMAS, without getting a thank you back or a seasonal greeting from him either, I guess that is where the disappointment  started, I opened up the meal which was heaped high with food and dived into the\\nvery large fried clams and after eating 3-4 realized that their was no discernible taste or normal seafood tang(If you will) to these clams, It tasted like I was eating fried batter and very bland at that.

The fries are cut thin, topped with shredded cheese and chili. Two excellent points about the fries. One: No beans in the chili. Beans are filler and they don't make up for lack of meat. Second: The toss hot sauce on top. Such a simple dish, but together it makes a little bit of love. \\n   In the end, I'd say get a burger, ask for extra cheese and absolutely get a dish of chili cheese fries and a coke. It's a nice, filling stop that is at a really great price.\\nGo for it."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Border is my favorite restaurant in the Boston area.

I heard about this place from a friend who said that this restaurant has the best steak and cheese subs around the Billerica-area. After having a steak & cheese from Liberty Bell, which I THOUGHT was the best place for such subs, I had to test out Mamma Maria's. Right when we pulled up, the cook glanced out the window & shot us a friendly smile.  The service was great. The cashier is not only friendly but funny, too.  \\n\\nThe subs were AMAZING - OUT OF THIS WORLD - to be exact. Along with regular subs, this place offers TEN specialty steak & cheese subs.   I got the \\"Showstopper,\\" which is steak & cheese with bacon, ham, sausage, pepperoni and BBQ sauce.  My friend got the \\"Olympian,\\" which is steak & feta cheese with mushrooms and Greek dressing. Both subs were VERY DELICIOUS! They were HUGE & only cost between $8 and $10. I am pretty sure they were only $8 each.  On a side note, my friend accidentally locked my keys in my car so I didn't actually get to eat the sub until it was about 2 hours old & even then, they were THE BEST SUBS that I have EVER TASTED. My plan it to keep going back to this place until I try almost everything on the menu. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Mamma Maria's.

On my recent trip to Austin I knew I had to visit Franklin Barbecue after seeing it on No Reservations on the Travel Channel. It was a rainy Saturday morning, but that definitely worked in my favor since it discouraged alot of people from coming and waiting in line. Even with the rain there was a long line though and the staff let us know that the wait time would about 3 hours. Cory was amazing at informing us of what items would likely be available once we reached the front of the line, noting our backup picks and giving us a dead on estimation of a 3 hour wait. I love that they notify those in the line of what they can expect so that no one waits for hours and gets disappointed or blindsided by the wait time or food items available. The line moves at a steady pace, bring some games, drinks, snacks, etc. to kill the time.... it just feels like a huge tailgate party to be honest. Franklin even provides free fold out chairs and umbrellas for its guests to use while they wait in line. They also offer alcoholic beverages as well, but not for free though :P\\n\\nOnce we reached the front of the line, we were lucky enough to get all of the items we wanted to order initially. Bread is complimentary with your order.\\n\\n- Brisket - Perfectly charred skin, not super fatty... delicious! \\n- Pulled Pork - SO MUCH FLAVOR! I wish we had some leftover so I could make sandwiches for days, can't see myself getting sick of it :) The meat was very soft and tender.\\n- Pork Ribs - The meat literally slides off the bone, it is perfectly cooked. I am usually not a fan of ribs because of the mess, but these were the best ribs I have ever had in my life! The pork ribs had a nice char to the skin as well.\\n- Slaw - Our sad excuse for veggies with our meal, decent overall and added a nice crunch to our meal.\\n- Potato Salad - Super creamy, my favorite side out of the two we had :)\\n- Bourbon Banana Pie - Delicious, couldn't really taste the bourbon though.\\n- Key Lime Pie - I have never been a fan of key lime pie so I did not enjoy it.\\n\\nThe order came out to about $90 and fed the six of us. We were STUFFED! Again, this was the best barbecue I have had in my life. If I ever come back to Austin, I am definitely going to take advantage of the pre-order to satisfy my Franklin craving.

Well I know, they don't advertise and its very hidden. So happy I found it but sad it took so long. Looked up pizza on yelp when in the area and found this GEM. It is inside a little convenient mart tucked in the corner. They have one tiny table and a few bar stool so its a takeout thing. Love the simplicity of pricing..all pizzas are 10' & $10 or 3 for $25. No matter what toppings you pick. CASH only but ATM right there. \\nSo this pizza is amazing! UH_MAZING. Its is just as good as our fave spot in NYC. There is a true wood fired stone pizza oven and they let you walk around the counter to see your pizzas cook if you like. The size of the pizzas are perfect for the oven. Cooked quick and an even crust texture (no burnt spots or soggy spots) Their toppings are fresh and their specialty pizzas all sound fantastic. \\nWe chose these 3:\\n*10b - Jamies Hawaiian.

One of my friends had been here a few years back and reported that the experience was \\"tasty, but not amazing.\\"  But, I'd been walking past this restaurant on Newbury Street for years and decided to try it out for myself.  After all, she'd been there a few years ago - maybe they changed their menu since then.\\n\\nFirst I was struck by how friendly and attentive everyone was.  From the hostess to our waitress to the busser, every person had a smile on their face and a cheerful attitude.  One waitress (not ours, but for a table nearby) was actually training someone new, and I overheard her say to her trainee \\"Ok, it looks like that gentleman just finished his Corona, so we should go over and ask him if he needs another.\\"  It really established that they set the tone of taking care of you and making sure that your experience is enjoyable.\\n\\nNow on to the food.  My mom and I shared the (HOMEMADE) chips and onion dip for an appetizer.  Delicious.  The cool dip was very light and fresh, and not terribly filling (like many appetizers are).  For entrees, I had the lamb chop with fregola salad and fried leeks - AMAZING.  Usually when I ask for my meat to be cooked medium, I get it slightly rarer than ordered.  Not here.  Cooked perfectly, and the lamb LITERALLY melted in my mouth.  The combination of the lamb, salad, and crumbled feta was divine.  My mom had the Thai stir fry - bright, fresh, beautifully cooked.  Her only complaints were that a) it was very spicy (more so than she thought it would be), and b) the portion was gigantic.\\n\\nBut now...on to desserts.  The chef had literally created an entirely new dessert menu days earlier, so we took our recommendation from our waitress.  She recommended the 24 layer chocolate cake, which she said was quite literally \\"heaven on a plate.\\"  We took her advice...and oh yes, it's 24 layers of rich chocolate cake, fudge, and chocolate gnoche.  We shared a slice, and had to bring it home to finish the next night, but that was almost better because we had not one but 2 nights of delicious chocolate heaven.  But fear not loyal Sonsie diners - despite the new dessert menu, Sonsie still has their famous bread pudding.\\n\\nMy mom complained about the music choice and the fact that it was so loud, but I didn't find it to be that big of an issue.  All in all the food was great, the service was great, and the evening was great.\\n\\nPS...even though they don't technically have \\"outdoor seating,\\" when they open those front doors in the spring and summer, it's basically like dining outside...but without the sun beating down on your face."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"ok, on a Tuesday nite, this place was hopping! i only came here to shop for a black cardigan but bf was hungry and i told him i'd buy him dinner since i was dragging him shopping.\\nwe sat at the bar since we would eat right away, there were quite a few ppl waiting.\\nso bar wasnt that busy but the bartender seemed to have his head spinning. he took a while to take our order and do his other business.\\nthe one thing u must must get here is the zuppa toscana. its like the best soup ever!!!!!! the kale, sausage potatoes and spicy broth goodness is sooo delicious. and so awesome to dip yuor breadsticks in.\\nwe got our food in a timely fashion , the bartender tried to keep up with everyone except the lady next to me. she was alone, enjoying wine and what looked to be a good book. she had her salad and breadsticks and it took forever for her meal. she looked like she had been sitting there a while and we were almost finsihed with our meals till she finally called the attention of the bartender to ask where her spaghetti and meatballs were. after doing some other things, he finally went to check. no apology, just that the ktichen has set times for meals..but this one guy who came way after her , already had his spaget and meatballs. she was already on her 3rd glass  of wine too! \\nbf and i felt bad but what are we gonna do...\\nsooo back on track, i ordered the gnocci and chicken veronese. it waas ok, the sauce was sort of oily and think but good. the gnocchi was delectable. bf has shrimp caprese and the shrimp was grilled yummy.\\noverall, this place is cool.but hot damn, being busy on a Tuesday nite is crazy!"},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this restaurant.

Coming from a large Italian family, marinara is something I'm very picky on. The Alfredo penne on the side was the best Alfredo I've had--not very heavy at all. My husband had the gnocchi special (mushroom) and he loved it. For dessert, we thought we were getting something small and light--an order of dark chocolate mousse.

Because it is the best place in Harvard Square, maybe even Cambridge. You will always leave satisfied with your portion, it's very affordable (especially for HS/Cambridge), and the ambiance is amazing! It seriously feels like Christmas in Mexico every day of the year (and who wouldn't want that?)\\n\\nI usually order the chicken quesadilla (with a side of guac) and their unsweetened iced tea and I leave with only a ~$12 bill after tip. Sometimes I get the Tostada en Grande salad and it is so yummy and filling (its a salad with guac inside a tortilla shell).\\n\\nService is always great (they fill up on the chips and salsa / drinks very attentively and oh my are the warm chips so good). \\n\\nIt's nestled on a side street in Harvard Square and there is paid parking right across the street which is very reasonable. Wait time isn't normally that bad unless you have a humongous group and it's Saturday night (but even then not that bad).

The salad with lemon on top made this a meal to enjoy before walking/exploring or tackling the day.\\n\\nThe grits bowl was rich and delicious.\\n\\nThe biscuit was large and the type you eat with a fork and knife. Rave reviews on the pimiento cheese and the biscuit.\\n\\nNit: Patio seating in mid-March on a cold morning.... brrrrr.

They were out of ribs so I went with the brisket and the pulled pork.\\n\\nReferring to their moist brisket as 'smoked' is a huge understatement.  The typical smoked brisket still has the general consistency of grilled or baked meat.  Frankin's moist brisket is smoked to a point that it's hard to know where the meat ends and the fat starts.  The meat is nearly liquefied - like your muscles feel after spending a long time in a sauna.  Combined with the very flavorful rub, it makes for an addicting experience.  I don't care for their espresso bbq sauce but didn't mind the vinegary pork sauce on it.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was a revelation as well.  Nice smoky flavor.  Loved the aforementioned pork sauce with it.  The sauce is as if you took a hot sauce and cut it with vinegar.  Best pulled pork I've had in a long time.\\n\\nOnly downside at this point is the long lines.  I spent about an hour waiting on a Friday afternoon.
