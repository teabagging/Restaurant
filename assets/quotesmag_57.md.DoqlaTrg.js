Its a nice place inside and out but they put us on the 13th floor. Who ever heard of a hotel with a 13th floor? Well, we stayed and the bad luck ensued. 2nd problem was then the shower chair they had(because I'm disabled) didn't fit into the tub. What? Hasnt this been looked into? On top of that, they have bathrooms with a louvered door. This means sounds & smells go right out through the door. You can chat with the rest of your party while taking a crap. Not private at all. The 2nd night i complained about it. Their excuse was that there were not fans in the bathroom. What? They took the shower chair and a while later bought the same shower chair back. Obviously this wasnt going to work. I asked about the private bathroom door and they told me they could get us a room with a solid door that would accommodate us. So then we asked for the new room. They seemed to accommodate, the girl at the desk even showed me a picture of what the new room was supposed to look like. The next day the manager came with to show us the room. Well the room not only didn't look like the picture, it had a louvered bathroom door, and was only about 2/3 as big as the previous room. It did have a shower bench built into the shower. Nonetheless i wasn't pleased. My family was getting tired of changing rooms at this point and i was fuming thinking i had made our stay worse. Fortunately my sister went and spoke with the manager again and the next day openend the room next to ours free of charge. The day after that the manager Greg came and made sure we were happy. He comp'd us for the first 3 days. That made me feel a whole lot better. The next day there was a water problem on our floor, and hot water was scarce. Ill attribute that to being on the 13th  floor.

Superb.\\n\\nThe deserts were also amazing, especially the home-made ice creams and the chocolate cake.\\n\\nFinal recommendation: ask for a \\"Purron\\" full of champagne and pass it around the table.  it looks like a bong, but you actually use it to pour a stream of liquid into your mouth from above...lots of fun for the whole table and probably for the tables around you too :)"},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"My good this is nasty.

The interior is quite light and airy, minimalist, and with modern-industrial touches: poured concrete tabletops, birch wood chairs and beams, painted masonry, lots of beautiful plants, pops of bright yellow, black metal fixtures and accents, etc. \\n\\nSeating & Service: The restaurant is a two-story space with a dining room on each floor plus a generous covered patio and rooftop bar upstairs, both overlooking the Beltline. On our recent visit, we ate inside due to rain but will definitely be back for the outdoor seating! The first floor dining room had a number of booths, tables along banquettes, and high chairs at the bar. Small and medium sized groups should be easily accommodated and larger groups with some rearranging. Reservations are available online for the dining rooms, but the patios are first come, first serve. There is also a separate room available for private parties as well. Service was great; accommodating, professional, and friendly. \\n\\nFood & Drinks: the menu is listed top to bottom from smaller to larger shareable plates and has a few rotating items among its standard dishes. There was also a comprehensive drink list with some tempting cocktail and wine options and a solid selection of, unsurprisingly, craft cold beer. The dishes had a sort of Asian/Southern theme to them--which, as an Asian Southerner, I am not opposed to if done well. I generally am wary of \\"Asian Fusion\\" dishes, but thankfully, I had nothing to worry about! The Cold Beer team did a great job merging flavors and highlighting less common products throughout the menu. From which, my dining partner and I shared the following plates: \\n\\n+ Fried Okra, Szechuan Peppercorn, Burnt Eggplant, Labne ($12) \\n+ Charred Corn, Crab Nduja, African Blue Basil ($17)\\n+ Barbequed Beef Belly, Hoisin Watermelon, Peanut ($18)\\n+ Peach Pavlova, Mulled Wine, Fig Leaf, Anglaise ($8)\\n\\nWe enjoyed pretty much everything and especially the charred corn dish. My dinner companion found the Fried Okra a bit too salty--and some pieces at the very top certainly were oversalted but the rest was fine (and rather tasty) to me. The Pavlova was a fun, seasonal treat with local peaches and the most satisfactory crunch when breaking into the shell with a spoon!\\n\\nOverall, we both really enjoyed our experience at Cold Beer. It's another great addition to Chef Gillespie's group as well as to an already crowded Eastside Beltline restaurant scene.

My husband ordered the Petite Fillet Mignon and  Seared Pork Belly. The steaks were juicy and tender.For dessert I had Campfire Pot de cr√©me.  And my husband had Chocolate Berry Trifle.  \\nAll in all, it was a great experience. The wait staff, including our head server, Kelly, made this a pleasant dinner. One that makes us want to go back again."},{"name":"Hunan Bistro","address":"10700 Anderson Mill Rd, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was very salty, wasn't as good as before.

Aside from taking our order and bringing out the food, they didn't come check on us again until we wanted our check. No warm greeting, no smile, basically void of customer service.\\n\\nFood: I got the sushi A combo, which contains the expected salad and miso soup, along with a California roll and 6 pieces of sushi. Let's say that the sushi you get at the grocery store is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. This is a lowly 1. I don't even like California rolls, but I know what they should taste like. These had no taste. The rice was barely sticky, and not enough seasonings to make it \\"sushi rice.\\" All the meat I tasted was all super bland as well. I don't mean it just tasted like poor quality lacking in freshness; I mean it was basically absent of any savory meat taste! Even the miso soup was off. I didn't even drink half of my cup. You know what the best thing was? The small salad. That's how sad it was. And for my $16 combo, not even ice cream at the end? That was the exclamation point at the end of a terrible experience. \\n\\nNo wonder there was hardly anyone else in there at dinner time.

I wish we could've tried the salsa flight because the salsa we did try on the tacos and the queso were unbelievable. We will definitely be back to try everything on the menu.

Boston Tea Stop was on the list of places to visit, as a good friend of mine that I was with highly recommended it.\\n\\nWe arrived at noon and were disappointed to find out that they didn't open until 12:30. When we came back at 12:30, there were a few other people waiting for them to open. We walked in and I ordered the jasmine green tea with boba (all drinks are served cold and with boba unless you request otherwise). My friend got the taro milk tea with boba. The prices here are pretty good for the location and quality of the tea (I paid $3.95).\\n\\nThe tea was made quickly and it was very good. They use the small boba which were good but I would have liked the bigger boba (not sure if they offer them for an upgrade or not). Overall, definitely worth a stop if you're a fan of boba.

Originally, I wanted to try gorditas, which sadly they didn't have, but I got the chilaquiles and a pastor taco instead and both were great. The chilaquiles taco was somehow sweet, balancing out the saltiness of the meat, while the pastor taco had some of the most tender meat that I've tread (amazing but a little on the greasy side). I would say that this spot is a solid 10/10 and highly recommend it!\\n\\nAlso, hint hint, Vintage Heart Coffee is right next door so if you haven't gone already, that's a must too!"},{"name":"Smokey Bones Bar & Fire Grill","address":"3400 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"(8/26/2017)  Got a coupon in the mail for $10 (and they sent another for later and one for take-out).  The place is directly across from Fashion Square Mall.  Looked to be weirdly, groups meeting for dinner, frazzled moms shepherding little league teams, lone travelers.  Smokey Bones was once part of the Darden restaurant group, but was cast off and started a new as its own chain.  Got a Pick Your Own Combo with three:  Smoked Beef Brisket, Slow-Smoked Spiced Sausage, and House Smoked Hand-Pulled Pork with BBQ Baked Beans and Mashed Potatoes and another combo with 1/3 rack Baby Back Ribs and Smoked Wings, also with BBQ Baked Beans, and Natural Cut Fries.  Not sure we really got good smoke flavor out of most of these smoked meats, most tasted the rubs, lots of cumin in the ribs and lots of celery seed (Lawry's season salt?) on the wings.  I usually go for the flats (wingettes), but these were all disappointingly drumettes and super dry.  Sauces were a nod to the American regions, but all pretty middle of the road (KC, South Carolina mustard-based, Eastern Carolina vinegar-based, but not really, Chipotle BBQ, looking towards the southwest, I suppose).  One thing I do love about southern American is the abundance of sugar in cornbread, and there was plenty of it in the Skillet Cornbread.  With a schmear of the honey pecan butter, it was totally like having dessert first and why not.  We decided to skip the wait for a table (and avoid being sat near the screaming babies) and sat at the bar for dinner.  The bartender was friendly and attentive, and clearly had some regulars.  Booze was relatively inexpensive ($4.25 for a single-shot mixed drink) and almost the same price as the fancy non-alcoholic beverages (the Bubbleade was fun, topped with those juice-filled popping boba).  Overall, super shiny, corporate and sleek, not exactly like down home BBQ from any particular region.

At least the lounge/ bar section. Recently I was on vacation visiting family down in that region and had better part of a day to kill, so I stopped into this local establishment that was located in a strip mall on the Braintree/Holbrook Massachusetts line. From its nice stone work fa√ßade with conjoining businesses I figured it to be a reputable place to grab a cold drink and perhaps play a lottery game of Keno that was advertised on a sign located on one of the blinded windows. NOTE: There was an undercover agent pulling surveillance in an SUV outside of said business, but that's besides our point. Anyway once I entered this establishment I had to adjust my eyes as it was almost pitch black with no lighting inside, only a few television screens lit sections of the small bar room. It was extremely dank and smelled of urine and vomit...almost stinging to the senses, but I wanted to give this dive bar a chance. If only for one drink and said game. There were about six or seven guys at the bar, either passed out faced down or close to it. They were way beyond the intoxicated limit and it was only late afternoon time. Immediately ignored by the female bartender ( got the impression outsiders are NOT welcome from her angry face),I filled out a Keno lottery game ticket and waited patiently for twenty minutes until the bartender finally gave me attention and asked for my ID. The pretty, but very tired looking blond server threw back my valid New Hampshire's drivers and rudely told me that they don't serve people from out of state. At first I thought it was a joke...perhaps some kind of local act they play for out of towners ( I appreciate that stuff and enjoy it), but it wasn't the case. I politely asked why, and she said it was a \\"state thing\\" and I needed to leave. I have absolutely no idea what that means. I am of age(33yrs old).  I worked as a bartender years back, but have never heard of such a preposterous regulation. Almost all bars statewide have scanning devices to detect false id's. How do people visiting from out of state get service here then? The whole thing irked me. She looked like she was a hooker maybe. After leaving confused and returning to my friends and family, I later learned that particular area has been involved in high traffic illegal sex operations. Probably why it was being staked out by law officials. Never have I had the food, but from the looks of the adjacent bar and staff I wouldn't recommend it. The whole place was dingy and dirty. Pee-soaked floors and unwashed drinking glasses littered the bar section. I can't determine it...but I saw a very large rodent scurry from what appeared to be the kitchen/ illicit activity room.

I phoned in the order my roomate got shrimp chop suey and shrimp fried rice, i ordered bok choy with blackmushooms and vegetable fried rice.\\nWhen i got there to pick up my order it was not ready more, it wasent even in the process of being cooked. The gentelman at the till called back my order when i got there. This was entirely fine with me it meant we were getting freshly made food. \\nThe food my bok choy and blackmushrooms were forgettable. It consisted of maybe 2 bok choys all chopped up into bite size pieces and slightly over cooked. black mushrooms whole and sliced in half were fine. Just really piss poor with the bok choy. When ive ordered this at other chinese restaurants they always give you whole bok choy and plenty of them. Very unsatisfying and not that healthy meal i thought i was going to have. The vegtable fried rice was ok. Not outstanding and nothing out of the ordinary no addition of some special fresh ingredient to make it stand out. \\nMy roommate enjoyed the shrimp chop suey. But he said its not as good as where he normally gets it.

American Fresh is completely unassuming, housed under a large white tent in Assembly Row, but one should never judge a book by its cover. Inside this tent (which is only temporary until the weather gets warmer) is a beer garden that may become my staple hangout. Their beer selection is on point, and as a dark beer and chocolate lover, I'm slightly obsessed with the Porter Square Porter, which is a dark stout infused with Taza Chocolate. Like, really?!\\n\\nAnd the perfect pairing for a phenomenal beer is a great food, and American Fresh has got you covered. Their fluffernutter sandwiches are delish, made with Somerville's own Fluff and high quality almond butter. It's one the best fluffernutters you could possibly want to put in your face. The rest of their menu is extensive but not overwhelming, and to think that it all comes out of their tiny kitchen is unbelievable!\\n\\nWhat I fell in love with the most about American Fresh is their MO. They cater to everyone and anyone - from stay-at-home moms to non-profits to the casual Friday night drinker. The owners understand who their customer is and who they are as a brewer. and you can see that personality in the smallest details.

They don't have high end offerings like uni or ikura but they do offer hamachi and unagi as nigiri. The maguro, salmon and escolar sashimi were all good.

We got in at 3:45pm, and were told that the kitchen wasn't open until 4, but we could get drinks and oysters at the bar. Great!\\n\\nI wasn't surprised, per se, at the price of oysters, but it did occur to me that they, in a family restaurant in Medford, were charging as much for shellfish as, say, Sonsie, a high end bar on Newbury street. Certainly not a turn-off, but my expectations were raised a bit. The bartender took our order, and started shucking the oysters and clams in front of us.\\n\\nA couple things surprised me: She wasn't wearing gloves, and repeatedly went from handling our shellfish to dealing with things around the bar, talking with other customers, and there was no hand washing observed at any point. This wouldn't be a huge deal, except she was terrible at shucking. I would be surprised if she had been trained at it. Her hands were all up in there. There were huge chunks broken off shells, and oyster shrapnel everywhere. It was a mess. \\n\\nThe presentation was... I mean, what presentation? Oysters and clams stacked on top of each other in a haphazard manner, dirty old ice water (I'm talking visible discoloration and old oyster shell chunks, in mostly water with a few ice cubes directly from the oyster display) on a dinner plate serving as the base, and, to top it all off -- a package of oyster crackers thrown on top (Get it!? They're OYSTER crackers!!!) for good measure. I've eaten shellfish at many restaurants in many states and countries, and I've never seen anything as jaw-droppingly awful as this.\\n\\nTo her credit, she did come back a couple of times to ask if everything was okay, but how was I supposed to explain \\"WTF is this supposed to be? This is how you serve shellfish here!?\\" I mean, what am I supposed to do? Refuse the plate and leave? I did tell her that there were some shell chunks (to put it mildly) in the clams, and, to my horror, she took the remaining clam, washed it out in front of me, and put it back on my plate. Um... thanks. And then she took the clams off the receipt. Well, that wasn't really the problem, but whatever. \\n\\nWe were going to stay a while and get dinner after the kitchen opened, but left after that disaster, and went to a, really fantastic, Mexican restaurant across the street.

The gorgeous oval bar is an amazing center piece, which makes looping around to check out the dining options that much more enjoyable. Their concept of providing multiple seating areas on different floors is another great aspect to this food hall. I'd recommend going up to the rooftop during some good weather to take in views of the mountains while tossing back some oysters on the half shell. \\n\\nI had to ding Rosetta a few stars due to some hopefully early opening jitters. Namely, their draft beer system was having significant issues on back to back nights, and was only putting out full pitchers of foam instead of a cold pint of beer. Beyond that, I was happy with the variety of food options available, and even more satisfied with their text notification system. Very clever system that reduces clutter around the food stalls, and allows you to kick back at your table with friends while you wait. \\n\\nOverall, I look forward to checking out Rosetta again another time, but I think I'll give them a little time to work out their quirks.

Overall I really liked my experience here. Great food, good drinks, relaxing casual environment that fits well with the Beltline ambiance.\\n\\nThis place is located just at the intersection of Edgewood and the Beltline on Spx alley. Like all restaurants on SPX alley- there is no free parking lot. You're bet bet for free parking is to park along Edgewood and take the ramp down to the Beltline. There is also a paid parking lot behind Spx alley.\\n\\nThere are several seating options. For now, they have a first come first serve patio, and reservations required dining hall. Eventually they will also have rooftop seating, but that isn't open currently. \\n\\nTo me the food and the ambiance really convey a lively casual bar. The decor was bright and earthy, with grey and light wooden tones. They also had a really cool polar bear painting. The food was really good, I would describe it as fusion bar food- I mean that in a good way. They don't have burgers, nachos and fries, but they have stuff that sorta reminds you of food you'd have at a bar, but refreshingly modernized. The food is locally sourced farm to table.\\n\\nApparently, according to some articles, their menu is going to rotate weekly serving 15 different dishes ranging from 8-20 dollars. Dishes are small and are meant to be shared. You'll need to have 2-4 dishes person to feel full. I'm going to rank the dishes that I tried, but I don't know if it'll be useful in a week.\\n\\nMust have cocktail: strawberry: low waste practices. This drink is amazing. Tastes like a strawberry tart! Strawberry vinegar perfectly balanced the sweetness of the strawberries.\\n\\n1) blueberry dessert- this was an amazing dish! It's funnel cake on top of a warm blueberry filling topped with hay ice cream. It reminded me of my favorite carnival food, but so much better!\\n\\n2) bbq beef belly- this is an extremely fatty dish(they warn you from the onset) technically it's beef belly, but it actually reminded me of fois gras because of its high fat content. The fat really accentuates the beef and the bbq flavors well. I really like it\\n\\n3) smoked chicken- looks like chicken, but it tastes like smoked ribs! Delicious!\\n\\n4) charred corn and crab- the charred corn was sweet and had a firm texture. It complemented the crab really well.\\n\\n5) shrimp pancake- it fuses two dishes I really like- Korean seafood pancake and spicy Thai salad. Make sure to eat both the pancake and salad with each bite to get the full effect of this dish. I really didn't know the dishes would mix so well.  It looks like you're eating a garden\\n\\n6) beef tartare-the waiter described this as a deconstructed Rueben. They will mix the deconstructed components after presentation and you eat it on top of a really tasty thin fried potato. \\n\\n7) summer squash- really well cooked squash mixed with burrata cheese. Nuts add a much needed crunchy component\\n\\n8) lamb ribs- this was really tasty ribs. I really don't have much to say beyond that- it meets my expectations. \\n\\n9) oysters-the oysters were fresh and garnished well.  I really don't think there's much you can do to elevate raw oysters beyond the contents of its ingredients.\\n\\n10) cobia- my least favorite dish. I don't really have much to say about it.

My first time here, I got the Bombay and chose curry chicken and a bean dish. (I don't remember the name of it!) My co-worker also got the curry chicken, but went with a different veggie dish. I don't remember what it was called but it was made of up green veggies that looked a bit like okra. I went with white rice and my co-worker chose the chicken biryani rice. \\n\\nAll of our selections were good. The bean dish I chose was just a touch too spicy for me, but I was still able to eat most of it. I have a middle to low tolerance for spicy food, just FYI. My co-worker's veggie dish was really good. Not sure what those green veggies were, but I liked them. Oh yeah, we were also given samples of a dish that looked like polenta. Apparently it's akin to cream of wheat, seasoned and cooked with chopped vegetables. It was surprisingly delicious. The only disappointment was the bread.

From the exterior, I assumed it would be an awesome hole-in-the-wall with lots of character, minimal decor and authentic Mexican food. I was mostly right... but I was incorrect about the decor. The interior is actually REALLY cute, with chalkboard-style walls decorated with cute designs and inspiring words. The dining area is pretty large for a quick-service venue, with several sturdy wooden tables and chairs. Be forewarned... they're hightops, which some folks don't love. But luckily the chairs all have backs, which is important to me, from a comfort standpoint.\\n\\nThis is a quick-service, mom-and-pop-style dining experience. There was a friendly gentleman taking orders at the counter while a woman whipped up meals nearby in the open-concept kitchen. I think she was the only one cooking, but that certainly didn't delay my food. I ordered a burrito and a side of guacamole to go. My food was ready within about ten minutes, similar to a Tijuana Flats... which is extra impressive, considering there was only one chef.\\n\\nThe burrito was appropriately priced, flavorful and delicious. The guacamole was bright, chunky and fresh. I'm looking forward to going back to try the tacos and taco salad. And I'll DEFINITELY get the guac every time I return.\\n\\nGlad to have a local, mom-and-pop restaurant where I can get my fix on guac, tacos and more.

Our first trip to them, they were booked and turned us away.  The GM contacted us and got us in the next night and was wonderful, very kind and appreciative of our business.  The food honestly, was really good.  The kids menu was pretty non-existent, but they helped by offering homemade chicken strips with their wonderful batter.  The batter is used on their oysters, shrimp, and I believe the onion rings.  Every one of those items were DELICIOUS.  I highly recommend the fried oysters, which were given to us on the house for the inconvenience we experienced the night before.  The patio is a very nice touch.  We enjoyed sitting outside.

However, my substitute for the rice (which had corn in it) did not come out and I was given the rice.  Instead of complaining, after notifying the waiter who brought out the onion rings instead, I simply chose to not eat the last tortilla and ate the inside of the taco.

I was here for most of a week for a work conference (which was also in the hotel). The staff service level was great all around, from front desk, baggage services to event catering. \\n\\nThe reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating was because of some minor things with my room. When I arrived, there was a leftover ziplock bag in the ice bucket. I called housekeeping to get some new ice bucket bags and couldn't hear anything. The phone was dead. I tried dialing again and then realized it wasn't me, it was really dead. I had to move the cabinet and reconnect the phone line, which for an odd reason was not plugged in. The other thing that was a little weird was that my room wasn't made up until after 3 pm each day. I would be gone in the morning, maybe drop something off in my room at lunch, then come back in my room for afternoon break and housekeeping still hadn't got to it. My room was at the end of the hall, but still, it felt a little late for the room to be made up. Other than that, they did a good job keeping the room and bathroom clean. \\n\\nThe rooms are clean, the walls and carpet do not look worn and the bathrooms have granite counter tops. The large bathroom mirror and the table mirror are both lighted and do a fabulous job of minimalizing steam accumulation after a shower. \\n\\nThere is a nice pool with a waterfall and a water slide but what trumps the pool is their onsite gym. If you are the type that has to have your workout in, they have a spin cycle room with 12 bikes, a room with about 20 treadmills and ellipticals, a stretch and ball room, a bench area with barbells, tons of Cybex machines and another mirrored room for dance/yoga/pilates workouts. About 5 or 6 different rooms! \\n\\nThe daily meals for our large group meetings (500 people) were very good. A variety of food that was all fresh and then wait staff served juice and iced teas for breakfast and lunch.

But I've gone here twice and I was disappointed.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong. The food is satisfying, and the prices are ok, but the service is terrible.\\n\\nMy gripes about today:\\n\\n1. The menu. Their menus are poorly designed. You're supposed to mark on the laminated menu what you want to order. Well I do this, and the cashier didn't even look through it. He just typed in whatever was on the front page and gave me a total, without even double-checking if it was correct. I had to tell him the other items I had marked on the other page. He still didn't double-check if the order was correct. And he didn't give me a receipt.\\n \\n2. I do NOT like that the complete order isn't brought to the table at the same time. We were brought our sides way before our main dish was ready, so our sides were half-eaten and cold by the time I got my spring rolls. I would rather have waited at the counter to get my meal on a tray than to wait hungrily at the table with just a plate of chow mein in front of my face. Food is not enjoyable when you have tiny plates of sides presented to you one-at-a-time that are also meant to be shared with other people. That really sucked.\\n\\n3. Because they served our dishes one-at-a-time, they took our table number and completely forgot about my friend's main dish. We sat there waiting at our table for a very long time, not eating, until an employee came to collect our dishes. We told her we weren't done and that we were missing one main course. She told one cook. He didn't do anything about it. She then told the manager who also didn't do anything about it. We waited patiently for a little longer, ate the rest of the food, then we collected our things and went up to the counter again. A cook realized what the problem was, made my friend's dish, and gave it to him in a To-Go box! WTF?\\n\\nWe were hoping to share our order to taste the different items, but they blew it. They just ruined the whole dim sum experience.\\n\\nWe barely even got an apology. They forgot about us FOUR times. And I swear it wasn't busy.\\n\\nLike I said, I really wanted to like this place.

This place gets 5 bright red stars, and here's why:\\n\\nFirst and foremost, places where you can smoke cigars indoors (which in my opinion is the best way to smoke cigars) are few and far between and dwindling fast. For we cigar smokers, places like Greater Trumps are a god-send, and people who do not understand just how precious and rare these safe-havens are, should not be rating them, in my opinion. If someone were to walk into Greater Trumps looking for drink selection and a bite to eat, yeah, I can see how it wouldn't get a perfect 5 star review. BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT!! This is not a place to come to for dinner, or in a large group, etc. This is a place you come to relax and sip a drink to old jazz standards while you savor a cigar. And for what it is, Greater Trumps is my favorite place.\\n\\nNot only are cigar bars rare, but even rarer are cigar bars that 1) serve alcohol and 2) let you bring your own cigars from home. When I lived in California there used to be a cigar bar that would charge about 3 times the price of a cigar. You pay for both the cigar, and the entrance fee into the lounge where you can smoke the cigar, essentially. The same cigar you pay $10 at a lounge you can get online in for probably as low as $2.50. In this economy, I would not be able to enjoy cigars, one of my favorite things, if I had to shell out $10 a crack. The ability to bring your own cigars from home is PRICELESS to me. Just make sure that if you do bring your own cigar, that you give Greater Trumps your money in other ways. Order a few drinks and something to munch on. If you only order one drink, order one of their choice whiskeys or ports, splurge a little. Do not come here just to smoke a cigar and not buy anything. That defeats the purpose, and damnit I want this place to stay in business as long as I live!\\n\\nGreater Trumps is a McMenamins owned Pub, and I am grateful to the McMenamins for allowing cigar smoking here, in the Kennedy School's Detention Room, and at Edgefield's Little Red Shed. But there is something about Greater Trumps that, well, trumps even the other McMenamins cigar-friendly locations. Maybe it's G.T.'s proximity to the Bagdad Theater? Maybe it is the cozy, sometimes open-air feel to the interior? Maybe it's the jazz standard soundtrack they play MIXED with the low-lit philosopher's-den ambiance? I am not sure, but I am sure that I am absolutely in love with this place. I am in all sincerity thankful that such a place exists. \\n\\nTO THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE CIGARS:\\nPlease refrain from giving low reviews to Greater Trumps or places like it. You just don't understand. Yeah it smells like smoke in here, so don't write Greater Trumps a one-star review and complain about the smell! May as well give a one-star review to a dance club and complain about the noise level! And people like me, who love cigars and fear the day that places like Greater Trumps cease to exist, want to do whatever we can to keep them in business. I, for one, do not dance. That is why I refrain from reviewing dance clubs. I simply don't \\"get it\\". Likewise, if you don't smoke cigars, please think twice before giving Greater Trumps a review lower than 5 stars. And no, I'm in no way affiliated with Greater Trumps or the McMenamins. I'm just a Portlander who loves cigars and is grateful to have such a wonderful safe-haven to turn to."},{"name":"Pinkberry","address":"3393 Peach Tree Rd.

However it felt short on a lot of things. I ordered the churrasco which is one of the most expensive dishes. I specified that I wanted my steak rare, and just to enhance that I wanted it rare I told my server that I wanted is \\"bloody\\" or alive, as I hate overcooked meat. Sadly when my food was presented, my churrasco and incredibly overcooked. One of the things that did not help was that it was presented in a screaming hot fajita skillet, which continued to cook my steak to the point that parts of my steak was charred. I had to remove it from the skillet to keep it from cooking, but sadly the damage had already been done. The churrasco also came with chimichurri, but it was incredibly greasy, it was flavorless, it was mostly canola oil. It did not help my churrasco at all. Overall, I would not order this dish, it was sheer disappointment. \\nI also had a taste of the fish, which was pretty tasty. My dad, who ordered this dish was very happy with it. I also had a taste of the guanavana juice in milk which was also delicious.  The starter tostones were pretty awesome and would recommend them. \\nSadly, my dish was not the only thing that was wrong with this dining experience. There were five of us in my party and when the main dishes were presented, they were not presented at the same time. I would say about 15 min had passed between my brothers main dish and my husband's main dish. By the time my brother had finished eating, my husband was just getting his dish. Mind you, we had all ordered our mains at the same time. The service overall was very, very slow. We had seen people come in, order, dine and leave in the span that we were waiting for our food.  \\nMy mom and my husband had ordered the bandeja paisa which is always a Colombian favorite. The dish was very good, but my husband had complained that his egg in the dish was overcooked. My mom and also my husband also had told me that the chicharron was very greasy. My mom, who loves chicharron, had one bite of it. \\nOverall, the lack of timing when delivering dishes, and overcooking the $19 churrasco really killed it for me. My folks tend to frequent this restaurant and had only good things to say, but we had really bad luck on this visit. This is my first time at La Casona, but I doubt that I would return after this visit."},{"name":"Gabriela's Downtown","address":"900 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Always have the best food when I eat at Gabriela's!

The black truffle was the smallest portion I've received at a restaurant. Salt was missing from the table to add flavor... this of course took another 20 minutes to request. Halibut was sub par, salmon entree sides were bland. Burrata app was the highlight of our mother's day brunch. Also their infamous pizza is not available for dinner?  We asked if we could order the meatball app, just to be curtly told no as it is not on the dinner menu. Then on the way out we saw another family with 2 of these appetizers??

I spend a good fifteen minutes sitting on the floor of the airport when I got in, looking up eateries in Richmond before realizing there was no Lyft or Uber available and it would cost like $40 to hire a cab for this detour. Thankfully, I got one excellent Chinese meal during this trip, at the Dinesty Dumpling House on Robson.\\n\\nI went for lunch with three of my friends, who I convinced to make the longish walk here from the conference hotel. I was expecting a wait at 11:30 on a Saturday morning, but we were seated immediately. The restaurant was busy, though, and I think it got busier while we ate. I enjoyed the brisk, polite service and the bustling atmosphere. The interior was modern and trendy, especially for a reasonably priced dumpling place, with sleek decor and a wide window view of the kitchen.\\n\\nThe food was delicious. Dinesty specializes in soup dumplings, making the Din Tai Fung comparison inevitable, but whereas DTF's non-XLB offerings are not especially good, I thought everything we ate at Dinesty was fantastic. The steamed fish dumplings were excellent, as were the pan-fried pork buns and the pan-fried marinated beef wraps. And we did of course eat many orders of the steamed pork soup dumplings, and these were superb, with thin, supple skins, flavorful pork, and plenty of melty hot pork juice.\\n\\nI was extremely pleased with this lunch. The dumplings were top notch and we didn't have to drive to Richmond or even wait in line to eat them. I'd highly recommend Dinesty Dumpling House if you're looking for quality Chinese food near downtown Vancouver.

Being that it was beautiful out, the soft breeze felt wonderful and it couldn't have gotten better had they pushed our table out onto the sidewalk. She (our server) also let us all pay separately (including using our credit cards). Refusing to do so can often turn a nice time into a stressful ending. She was awesome and well deserved her 18% tip (mandatory for a large group). \\nCasa del Matador serves happy hour on Sundays. How great is that?? we all ordered a gazillion items, so the server was kept busy - but made a great tip from our table. I prefer their happy hour quesadilla's but the nacho is sooo large, it feeds 3 or 4 people. You can't beat that! \\nLastly, the place is really beautiful. The decor is Tex Mex meets Madrid or Barcelona.

It looks like the kind of place where all types of things are smoked, inhaled, snorted....but no one sparked up until after an hour or so of being there.They were a little distance away so it was not that bad as the service. When our waitress first approached us she said she was tired and looked every bit of it. I made her smile but it was short lived and so was her presence. She disappeared for 20 minutes at a time. the bills were wrong, (shrugs shoulders) she was awful. I get it, sometimes I am a little demanding when it comes to service, but I am an 18% and higher tipper. It hurt me to leave her 11% but she was that bad. A 3rd friend joined us and it was one of his first comments, \\"Where is our server?\\" We had to flag down other servers to go and find her or just place a drink order with them. \\n\\nOther than that, I like the spot.

We decided to go out for a bite after the gym. Needless to say, we were terribly under-dressed. However, we were treated extremely well by the entire staff. The hostesses were extremely warm and welcoming. We were sat at the chef's table which was a great experience. Our server/bartender was Jaqui and she rocked. She was so friendly, and really made us feel at ease. She knew the menu extraordinarily well and was super knowledgeable about mezcal. This restaurant is grinding its own masa and making its tortillas in-house.\\n\\nWe started our feast with Potato and Quesillo Taquitos and Chips, Salsa Y Caldera Cheddar. The taquitos were the perfect light starter. The soft-cheese made in-house (if memory serves) was fantastic. The chips appetizer was wholly unlike anything we had experienced before, in the best way possible. They fried their house-made tortillas, covered them in a dried chili salsa then topped with pickled veggies and a smoky cheese. Holy wow this dish was delicious. A few bites bordered on too salty, but truly a fantastic dish.\\n\\nWe then moved on to the Snapper Tostada. The snapper was extremely fresh and tender, and was perfectly dressed with a thick, delicious coconut, lime, chili pepper sauce. This may have been my favorite dish of the night. Next up were: Fish a la Devil and Suadero Tacos. The tacos were confit brisket which is then crisped up on a flat-top. These tacos were (like everything else we had on the visit), an amazingly balanced blend of flavors. The fish was served with all of it's accompaniments as a \\"make your own taco\\" style plate. The fish was tasty but the bacon veracruzana made the dish. I may have used two spoonfuls per taco. We finished up with Chocolate Con Churros. These were the perfect few bites to end the meal. The house ground Mexican hot chocolate was fantastic and the whole dish was not overly sweet. The churros were of an amazing texture and the housemade marshmallows were a bonus.\\n\\nI drank the Suerte Lager all night and I could have continued if I hadn't been so full of delicious food. This lager is a collaboration with Hops & Grain and it shows, because it is the perfect partner to all of the dishes we tried. The meal was fantastic, the kitchen was super organized, chef was friendly and responsive to our myriad questions, service was great. Yeah, I wouldn't change a thing. FYI, if you enjoy it as much as I did, feel free to send the kitchen a beer (or three)."},{"name":"Zeytin Turkish Cuisine","address":"4439 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"I've been driving by this restaurant for the past two years.

Then of course some baklava for dessert. Now let me tell you about this yummy dessert. It was freshly made so it  was still warm.

The server took our drink order and returned promptly with our beverages.  The first thing that caught my attention, one of the troubles of bag-in-the-box aka., post-mix beverage systems, was the flavor of my Coca-Cola was off, due to the highly level of chemicals in their water.\\n\\nI wanted to try the Texas Beef Brisket, I asked if it was available as a choice with the BBQ Combo: PICK TWO! YOUR CHOICE OF BAR-B-Q BEEF, PARK, BAR-B-Q CHICKEN, SMOKED TURKEY BREAST, SMOKED SAUSAGE, CAROLINA PULLED PORK OR PULLED CHICKEN?  The server told be, the Brisket was not available as a choice, I asked what cut the BBQ Beef was, she told me 'Beef', I asked what part of the animal was, ie., top round, she told me 'Round or Loin' but not brisket.\\n\\nI ordered the brisket, for my sides I ordered Collard Greens and Baked Beans.  The food came out of the kitchen in five minutes.  The first impression to me was the melamine plate was too small and was shop worn.  The 'Texas Toast', a buttered piece of thick sliced soft white bread was the most prominent thing on the plate.\\n\\nThe brisket was sliced very thin, it was not particularly hot, it had a nice looking smoke ring, but the only apparent seasoning I detected was a noticeable amount of salt.  There were a number of sauces at the table, I tried the mustard sauce, the Memphis BBQ sauce, and the sweet BBQ sauce.  They were all just ok.  The menu says the brisket is 'moist and full of flavor.'  What I had was dry and did not live up to its billing.\\n\\nThe greens were bland, there was a trace of smoked meat flavor.  They would have benefitted from some vinegar or hot sauce.  The BBQ baked beans were the best thing I had there, they were flavorful and chocked full of BBQ meats, but would have been even better if the temperature had been hotter at service.\\n\\n\\nAs a pastry chef I had to try one of the desserts.  The coconut pie was piled high, but was disappointing.  The frozen pie shell was pale and under baked.

It was AMAZING - I would highly recommend getting an X-Large to share with a friend and stuffing it with all the free toppings! I can't commend it enough - all my friends agreed that it was amazing. If quesadillas aren't your thing, you can order burritos, tacos, or tamales (on Fridays only) instead.\\n\\nThe sopapilla is a fried tortilla drowning in cinnamon and brown sugar, so devilishly sweet and sticky it hurt my teeth. Although I enjoyed it, I don't really think it justified its $5 price tag.

With the new remodel this McDonald's is hoping to polish their image. But...you can't polish a turd. That being said, I eat here occasionally and would enjoy coming back. I would appreciate better service, yes. And a shorter wait time. Especially when people that ordered before me are getting their order first. This is a busy location. They have at least 8 people working here. Only one is at the front register. And this person is not very attentive or customer service oriented in my experience. They now have a system of ordering whereby you can order on an app, a touch screen inside the restaurant, at the drive through or at the counter, and there are couriers picking up food for those who must not, or cannot leave the house. So they use a large printed number system on your receipt ticket. There is also a screen showing which order number is being served currently and which numbers are being prepared. Helpful, yes, but only if the numbers are actually used effectively does the customer benefit. Every other number I saw on that screen was called out as the order was presented. When my number was on the now serving side, I did not hear a number called, nor did anyone acknowledge that there was an order ready to go. I waited...I waited....I waited.... no number called, no \\"your order is ready,\\" no eye contact. Finally, when no one came to the counter to call the number, and the register worker was free, I approached to ask about my order. \\"Oh, it's here,\\" she said (bag sitting on counter, unattended), \\"I said Big Mac and fries.\\" I'm thinking: Um, really? Because that is not my number, and I'm certain you did not say a word about it, because I did not see or hear anything from you. \\n\\nMcDonald's seriously, if you are going to use a number system, be consistent.

It is what you make it. \\n\\nFood. \\nI'm always pleasantly surprised upon returning to The Ravenous Pig. There is no need to be ceremonious: It is incredible. Complex, rich, unique, fresh; it is worth every penny. That being said, portions are moderate, and larger than expected in some cases! My significant other and I never leave unsatisfied, yet we always wish we had room for more. I highly recommend the charcuterie board. The presentation and flavors will leave a persisting impression that will linger in the best way imaginable. For the entr√©e, I recommend the pork porterhouse. Presentation: intimidating. Price: on the higher end. Nevertheless, it is a must have. An experience in itself, which keeps my burning desire to return ever ablaze. I will say that out of all the pork I have experienced in my life, this steak is the very best. Juicy, tender, high quality meat packed with natural flavor. Cooked to absolute velvety medium-rare perfection. \\n\\nDrinks. \\nThe Ravenous Pig's cocktails are astonishingly complex and worth returning for time after time.

The burrito did not look appetizing to the eye and the tortilla was supposed to be toasted (this is an extra fee by the way) and instead it was soggy and dripping with bean juice. I took a bite and just couldn't eat it. I took it back to the counter to see if they could remake it and drain the beans before adding them in. I stood at the counter for about five minutes before someone offered to assist. I asked if all the toasted burritos were supposed to be this moist and he replied, \\"Yeah, that's what they normally look like.\\" I asked if it could be remade and he begrudgingly said yes. Unfortunately, when the new one was brought out, it was no longer soggy, but the ingredients were so bland and tasteless. The chicken had no seasoning and the white rice was bland.

His was all queso, not mustard - but it had salt. Neither salad had dressing on them, someone had to go get that for us.\\n\\nThen the real problem - the system is hard-coded to add a 15% tip. YOU pour the beer, YOU order the food, someone carries your food 50' from the kitchen to you and grabs a 15% gratuity for the whole meal for walking those 25 steps. Now, you can tell them that you don't want to add a tip (at the beginning or go through a hassle at the end), but that makes you feel like a jerk. They were saying that they were going to \\"fix\\" this, but let's be honest - they should have known that this was a problem.\\n\\nNope, not coming back. $48 for a flight of 4 small beers, a glass of wine, a salad and a pretzel.

It then took another 20-25 min to actually receive the paella to the table (which again, once we got it - it was quite tasty) but we'd been sitting for well over an hour and a half waiting - and the restaurant really wasn't that busy.

It's all in the moments. \\n\\nBut it's Summer 2017: The peacocks are still around, but the wedding gazebo is gone, and the big room is used for special events now. But think of an Austin restaurant that's in a renovated old house, then double the size & space, add two bars with craft cocktails, and offer a contemporary Southern menu with a touch of Indian fusion - hey, it's the new Mattie's. Victorian meets Millennian. Hip, cool, and very loud. \\n\\nFive of us shared three apps, five entr√©es, and two desserts, and the results were sure subjective: I thought the fried & roasted chickens were better than the pork, but she thought the pork was a whole lot better than the chicken or salmon. Interesting sides here with spicy bites. I kind of regret not trying their burger. We did agree the biscuits and p√¢t√© apps were good stuff, but the desserts were just okay. It totaled around $50 a head. Oh yeah, the staff is great, and I want to try their brunch. \\n\\nFinally, two brief moments: I noticed one gentleman seated behind us wearing a tie. In its Green Pastures heyday, there probably would've been one guy in the entire place not wearing a tie. I'll call that a GP moment. And at one point when I went to wash my hands, there was another gentleman blocking everything because he was intensely texting away.

Both meals looked filling and came with rice and beans. The Elote( Mexican corn) was delicious and chicken chimichanga meal was so yummy. Rice and black beans were included.  For my drink I had the pomegranate margarita fun bowl ($15) it was delicious, but I just needed it a tad stronger. My mom ordered fajitas and loved her entire meal. My whole family was completely satisfied and enjoyed all the foods. They even pleased my brother who is a picky eater. He loved his chicken quesadilla. One suggestion I would give is to include tacos on the kids menu. My siblings love tacos, but it wasn't an option for them on the kids menu and they were hoping to try some authentic tacos. My waitress was very polite and gave us quality service."},{"name":"Cold Beer","address":"670 Dekalb Ave NE, Ste 101","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We had an enjoyable experience at Cold Beer.\\nWe sat outside on a beautiful evening and enjoyed the activity on the Beltway.

We weren't told that it was valet parking only so we were shocked that when we pulled into a space we were waved down by an attendant and told it was valet only. Apparently we came in an entrance that did not have signage stating this, but no worries, we handed over our keys and went inside. \\n\\nUntil we ordered we were supplied with copious amounts of chips and salsa, which was very good. I had to stop myself from eating more as this could have quickly become my dinner. \\n\\nOnce we ordered, I excitedly ordered the Tofu Tacos, which comes with Lentil Soup. I thought it odd that the server asked how many I wanted as I figured there was a standard with the Tofu Taco Meal, but I said 2. My husband ordered the veggie quesadillas, with a side of black beans, and a Vodka/Cranberry (he later stated that he thought they only brought him cranberry as he didn't taste any liquor).\\n\\nIt didn't take long to get our meal, but the food runners seemed to be confused as to who got what. One of our friends dishes had green bell pepper in it and he said that he has been there numerous times and has never had bell pepper in his dish. They took it back and later on brought him the right dish. \\n\\nMy Tofu Tacos were pretty much flavorless, without the yummy sauce I smathered on them. It was delicious. My husband's quesadilla had not flavor and the black beans had so much salt, he started drying up right in front of my eyes (just kidding about the drying up part, but they were salty). \\n\\nWe eventually finished up our meal and left and I realized that I never received my lentil soup. At the end of the day, we felt the meal was subpar and we were overcharged for what we got...or didn't get. We would not go back based on this experience. \\n\\nThe only real pro to all of this is that our server had good customer service."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The sushi here is fantastic.

So we decided to try G-Men in Steveston area. \\n\\nThe restaurant was fairly empty on a Saturday night, the four of us were sat right away....which to be honest, I was so grateful for! Ramen places these days seem to have endless line ups.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple appetizers, Okonomiyaki and tori may don (fried chicken bowl on rice) And then we shared the miso ramen and added corn and egg.\\n\\nI loved the Okonomiyaki, it was fairly thick and had octopus and shrimp with cabbage. It was hot and crispy with the perfect mayo creaminess on top.  The chicken bowl was yummy too.  They know how to fry chicken and add the perfect amount of mayo and sweet sauce for a comforting bowl of goodness.  Sadly, the ramen was most disappointing.  The soup base wasn't as flavourful as most ramen places, we had to add a lot of fresh garlic to give it a boost of flavour. Also not a fan of the noodles, I prefer the freshly made ones. And these weren't. They also have beers on tap and every day they have some sort of drink special.\\n\\nFor price and selection (they also have a lot of sushi options) it was a place that would fit a lot of different cravings.

Even the second and third trips to Shanghai! Well, Dinesty Dumpling House in Vancouver didn't quite come close either.\\n\\nThis place is on the touristy Robson Street next to a couple of other Chinese restaurants. It was pretty busy when we went there, and something I noticed immediately was that almost all the customers are not Chinese. While I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's not a good thing either. This restaurant was closest to our hotel, and we didn't want to drive down to Richmond even though we felt it might a better experience.\\n\\nThe interior was nice and modern. I liked that the kitchen was viewable with the glass wall, so you can watch them prepare the dumplings.\\n\\nThe menu is a lot more extensive than I imagined. You literally get a giant picture book. Besides the Xiao Long Bao, there's also steamed and pan fried regular dumplings, buns, savory cakes, and spring rolls. Their main entrees hits all the main meats, fish and seafood, fried rice and noodles, soups, and desserts. And there's a breakfast menu too! It was extremely difficult to decide what to eat as I want to try everything!\\n\\nI guess Xiao Long Bao is a must since that is what Dinesty is known for. All the dumplings will have pork. We ordered one with crab meat and another with XO Sauce. I'm not sure if it's a Vancouver thing that many Chinese restaurants lack taste and flavor, but these dumplings were really bland and oily. When I bit into the crab meat one to drink the soup, it was mostly oil with a hint of pork and crab taste. The meat filling barely had any taste. The pork was under seasoned and there wasn't enough crab inside to even have its taste. The XO sauce was surprisingly even more bland!! How is that even possible especially when you're using XO sauce?? Well, it is! The pork is already under seasoned and there was just the smallest hint of XO sauce taste, and that was really from the large pieces of dried shrimp. I ordered the XO sauce one believing there'll be enough taste since XO sauce is very tasty. I was so disappointed! As for the dumpling skin, it was on the thick and doughy side. Sure making it thicker and doughy holds the soup more securely, but the thinner and less doughy yields a better eating experience.\\n\\nWe also had the Spicy Pig's Ears. This was really off the mark. The only tastes were green onions, sugar, and a lot of chili oil. The pig's ears were mostly stuck together and was difficult to separate. We like to slowly eat it. Eating one piece would've been a third of the plate. But they tender with the nice cartilage bite. This needed some soy and vinegar.\\n\\nLastly, we ordered the Summer Chicken with Basil in Triple Sauce. When I seen the words \\"triple sauce,\\" I thought, \\"this HAS TO BE tasty, right?? Right??\\" Well, even with octuple sauce, it'll still be bland. Sauce still needs salt and sugar and seasoning! While the chicken was nice quality and cooked very well and the outside layer of the chicken had some flavor from the sauces, the inside of the chicken had zero taste. The basil in this dish was non-existent. There was no herbaceous and brightness that you get when you're stir frying with basil. All this dish needed was salt and salt to marinate the chicken.\\n\\nOverall, I was fairly disappointed. I had high hopes for Dinesty Dumpling House, but it fell short of expectations. The food wasn't awful or inedible. It just lacked seasonings, taste and flavor, and everything was on the oily side. The staff here were just attentive. Not exactly friendly or courteous. I like they have such an extensive menu and would like to try other things, but it's really on the pricey side as I feel all the restaurants on Robson Street are on the pricey side since this is my third place here. I think the Dinesty's in Richmond may be better, but not sure.

However having to sit through such a dreadful experience prompted me to do so. In an attempt avoid wasting anyone's time I will summarize the top 5 most horrific things I experienced during this visit. \\n\\nWhen first walking into the restaurant around 9:45 or so I received a very kind greeting, not from the staff mind you, but the inch of grease caked on the floor causing most employees and customers to slip and slide around. Through the entirety of my visit there were almost 6 slips that I had witnessed. The staff claimed that they had \\"accadently used the kitchen mop\\" to \\"clean\\" the dining room. Which assures me that their kitchen is no friends of mine. \\n\\nThe second thing was the lack of service and functionality. The servers seemed to be in a frantic panic. Running around not acknowledging the people asking for their attention. Not to mention that it took 15 minutes to be seated by a host who had reluctantly stared and gave us the one minute sign over and over again.\\n \\nThird, Once finnaly being seated as to be expected there was nobody to take our orders and when someone finnaly did show up they quickly stated for us \\"hold on one second\\" and never came back. At least the fruit flies were anxious to take our orders.\\n \\nFourth, once we finnaly got a server (a new one) the food took well over an hour. I wouldnt call that fast food. Let alone quick service. Did I mention we were not able to escape until after midnight?\\n\\nAnd lastly I would feel bad to not mention that out of everything the second server who we had gotten was actually very nice and helpful. Unfortunately he was so busy trying to attend to everything else we barely got to see him. By the time we finished our food we had to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our bill. I probably could have gotten in my car and paid at the drive through faster than the register at the counter. Realistically I could have even driven 2 hours to get home and been served food at the Steak and Shake near my hometown exit all the way in Vero Beach before I got my food at this location. \\n\\nOverall I am unable to leave a 0 or 0.5 star review. So Steak and Shake. It's your lucky day. You get one star for your horrible service. At least the food was not terrible. I bet I would regret saying that if I could have a look in your kitchen or back of house. \\n\\nThanks for nothing \\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\nDisappointed. \\n\\nJTD Foodie Reviews."},{"name":"J.

We showed up a few minutes early, as expected, and did not mind waiting to be seated. We did however mind when parties with reservations after us (after 8 pm) were being seating before us. It was not that tables were not available, but that the staff sat other parties that looked older, and I am sure they thought that meant they were wealthier. After 40 minutes of waiting for a table and other tables being wrongfully seated before us, we left. We feel age discrimination had a role that they would not seat us because we are a young couple, but we are young professionals and it is unacceptable for this restaurant to seat others in front of you when you made a reservation and had high expectations for this restaurant. Not only was the seating unacceptable but the host stand employees were playing patty cake and eating food behind the desk instead of proving us the customer service expected. Before making our reservation, we were under the impression the restaurant had a respectable reputation and would be a perfect place to celebrate, and instead we discovered the opposite and will never take our business there again."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"4313 W Vine St","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2","text":"I havent been to a Steak n Shake in years due to a previous experience, but Mom recieved a coupon for her Birthday and she was determined to go, even if she had to walk to her there.

There were two guys cooking and preparing for like five other customers that were already seated and I'm standing there for about twelve minutes and no one was working the cash register.

That was appalling and the food was not that great to begin with. First off, I don't like their extremely thick milkshakes, it's ridiculous! They have these big straws for them and you can't even drink out them so that's completely useless. Second, my burger was cold despite the fact that the food arrived to my table shorter than how long I had to wait in line and they didn't even serve chicken nuggets, it was more chicken tenders but those were the best part of my experience.

I'm not sure what has happened, other than too rapid growth perhaps, but the last four cakes I've purchased have been incredibly disappointing and each time I wonder why I keep coming back. I guess it's the hope that the original melt in your mouth delicacies would return to taste like the individual slices they offer in the store. Sadly the last four cakes I've purchased have been second rate at best. One was still frozen - although when I called, the company insisted they do not freeze their cakes. The others were so dry that not a single person even finished their serving and the bulk of the cakes were tossed. This is true of the one recently yesterday. Ironically, I'd purchased an individual slice of cake at the same time. No comparison. The slice was the old moist and delicious cake i remembered. The cake I ordered for the celebration was pathetic and again I'm left wondering... why do i return? Skip the whole cakes and just buy the slices. Still puzzled as to why POC can't get it right.

The rest of our party had the shortribs and lamb.  We also had a plate of the wonderful shoestring potatoes to share.\\n\\nSo on to the randomness.  We were seated right away, but the service was a bit slow.  The restaurant is very stark with off white walls and a few high impact art pieces.  Not a warm, dynamic environment.  They are going for simple elegance in both their food and decor.  So, while my entree was excellent, someone in our group found a piece of styrofoam in his meal.  How does that happen?  The waiter did address this well, but it kind of kills the experience for at least one diner.  \\n\\nWe had a similar experience with dessert.  Two of the items received raves, but one was barely touched (very tart huckleberry sauce) and another only partially eaten.  Two of us (including myself) didn't see anything to die for on the menu so we didn't order dessert.  And if I don't order dessert on a special night out, something is seriously wrong with the universe.\\n\\nAlso, between our appetizers and entrees they brought us foie gras (\\"the delicacy of despair\\").  I was dining with some serious bird lovers so that didn't go over so well. \\n\\nAnd on to the final indignity.  I went to use the restroom and (how can I put this delicately) someone forgot to flush.  The fault of the restaurant, absolutely not.  Something you want as part of your night out at a nice restaurant - that would be a big no.  So for all you diners out there, if its brown, flush it down."},{"name":"1000 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria","address":"13599 W Colonial Dr","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"2.5","text":"We were SO excited to try 1000 Degrees.

We walked in and placed our order immediately...\\n\\nFor as many people as there are in the line to make the pizza, it sure was awful efficiency.

My boyfriend got a 10 inch BYO Neapolitan. \\n\\nThe people making the pizza were not very clear. We had to repeat ourselves MULTIPLE times. It was kind of frustrating. Also, the layout was odd. Some of the vegetables were not with others, and that was confusing. \\n\\nBy the time we got our pizza, we were excited to eat because we were hungry. We were frustrated that our pizza wasn't cut all the way through. Everything fell apart and it was a mess. See pics for evidence of that. \\n\\nOverall, I would spend $30 on 3 pizzas somewhere else.

We arrived at the hotel a little before 3 pm and our room wasn't ready yet. It wasn't a big deal to us because we could leave our things at the bellstand and explore, but the Hyatt wanted to make sure we were happy campers. They took my cell phone number so they could contact me when the room was ready and gave us a card for a complimentary dessert at the B-Line Diner. You could also use it for an in-room movie or appetizer at their two other dining locations. Mom and I LOVE dessert, so we decided to use it right then and there for an afternoon snack. We'd been told our room would be ready in about 20 minutes so that would give us plenty of time. \\n\\nUpon arriving at the B-Line Diner you are greeted by a huge case of beautiful desserts. After a couple minutes of checking out our options we decided to go with the Key Lime Pie. We were only a few bites into our pie when we got a text that our room was ready. Wow, that was quick! After a quick stop at the front desk we grabbed our bags from the bell stand and went up to our room on the 20th floor - it had an amazing pool view!\\n\\nThe rooms at the Hyatt Regency Orlando really do have everything you need. Comfy beds, fridge, coffee maker, a HUGE bathroom with a TV in the mirror, motion sensor night lights in the room and bathroom, a desk area, cordless phone, tv, and a big closet. \\n\\nThe next day our plan was to take advantage of our late check out (2 pm) and spend the day by the grotto pool. We checked in at the towel hut just before 10 am and they brought us to our poolside cabana. Talk about heavenly! There were three chairs outside of the cabana to lounge on, plus a big comfy daybed of sorts inside the cabana. The cabana also had a fridge and bar. There was even a button you could push to get a waiter to come over from the bar.\\n\\nThe grotto pool area is huge and has something for everyone! Waterfalls, a kids pool and beach, plenty of lounge chairs, a bar and restaurant, and even a slide.

It is a 1 dining credit restaurant, (used to be 2), and is themed around Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Up front this is my favorite Character Dining meal in all of Disney World. For the main reason that the food is unbelievably delicious and you get to meet 3 rare Disney Characters. Let me break down on what I thought was the best and worse about this dining experience. \\n\\nCharacters:\\nFirst off this is a Character meet and greet. I know there are some people that don't like them, so if meeting characters while your mouth is full is not fun for you, then I wouldn't come here. As for my wife and I we love meeting all the Characters we can. You get to meet Snow White, Dopey, Grumpy, and the Evil Queen. You can meet Snow at like 4 different Character Dining meals so meeting her isn't special. On the other hand meeting the Dwarves and the Queen is outstanding. The Dwarves can't talk so it is a little awkward, like Crystal Palace, but getting your picture with a rare Character really makes up for it. You also don't get to meet the Queen until you leave but it builds up a lot of suspense and makes it feel more like a honor to meet her. The huge plus side to this is that the restaurant is pretty small so you get a lot of time with everyone. More than at Cinderellas Royal Table. Snow talked to us for like 5 mins, Grumpy played with us for a while, and we got to chat with the Queen! This is definitely one of the reasons why you want to come here.\\n\\nRestaurant:\\nThis place is gorgeously themed. It is connected to one of the nicer resorts and was a 2 credit dining experience, so you know it has to be pretty. Once you enter Artist Point you are welcomed by painted murals of the Characters and scenes from the movie. Then as you make your way in it turns into a high class rustic restaurant. The pillars and walls turn into the forbidden forest the higher it goes until the ceiling is cover is tree branches and leaves. Inside those branches are lights that react to the Characters on when they enter. Snow White has a very pretty light that dances around when she runs through the room and the Evil Queen turns the forest red as if the whole restaurant is scared of her. It really has the Disney Magic and is one the better restaurants there is. We had a great seat, great view, wasn't too close to anyone, and was just in awe of everything.\\n\\nStaff:\\nI will make this one quick because we have only been here once but our complete staff was outstanding. The hosts were super friendly and talkative, our waiter new the menu back and forth, gave us great recommendations, took pictures of us, and was just very charming. They all were amazing at their job.\\n\\nFood:\\nThis is a 1 Credit Dining experience that used to be a 2 but still feels like it. It is also a 3 course meal like Cinderellas Royal Table and Be our Guest dinner. This restaurant offers a lot of beef and seafood options but there are 3 courses. First off there is shrimp, mushroom soup, and a charcuterie plate. My favorite was the shrimp and my wife's was the mushroom soup. Second or main course is next and my wife got the salmon. She said it was incredible and I really liked the bite I had. My main was Pork and mussels, and it was absolutely amazing! This is honestly one of the best meals I have ever had at Disney World. I suggest this if you have the chance to go. Next was dessert and you get like 3 different samples of dessert and they were good but nothing was that amazing. After that they bring you the Queens heart present in a gold case with smoke coming out of it. This was one of the coolest things about the entire meal. I can't wait to go again and try something new here! \\n\\nOverall this is one of the best experiences my wife and I have had at Disney World. I can't really think of any cons that we had because our experience was that good! Also we did a celebration here with flowers/gifts and they handled it amazingly. Everything was flawless. This is my most highly recommended Character Dining experience at Disney World. It is a little difficult to get to but it is worth the ride and you time."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Excellent service and excellent food!

I have little to no experience with Georgian foods, but I liked the flavors. My issue with the place was the actual bake. The dumpling skin was too thick and you were left with raw dough in the top of the dumpling where it was gathered together. The kubdari had a tasty pastry, which I'm guessing is a hot water crust. The problem is they cooked the fillings beforehand to prevent moisture in the pie and then when the pie was cooked the filling was effectively dry and tough. The pastry was also undercooked and raw dough in parts.

But there weren't any lines when I went anyways. \\n\\nI liked that they have a tasting menu for $65 where you can try 4-5 courses and the staff meal which was $36 for a sample of 4 curries. The staff meal also comes with naan and saffron rice. We weren't too interested in the items on the tasting menu so we got the staff meal to share and an order of lamb popsicles in fenugreek cream curry. \\n\\n- The staff meal (4/5): This is a great way to try various curries. I think it's enough to share considering the fact that I eat more carbs and sauce than the protein itself. You get to try the goat, duck koftas, rabbit & paneer cake and vegetable curry. The only complaint would be that all 4 curries are a bit on the spicy side and I can usually take spicy. I wonder if they can tone it down per request.\\n\\n- Lamb popsicle (4.5/5): The lamb was super tender and I absolutely love how creamy the curry was. The spice level was good. I think the cream neutralized the heat a bit. I just wished there were more lamb popsicle.\\n\\nWe were given these amuse bouche at the start of our meal.

I guess he thought you could because he had worked the venue before. Guess what, you couldn't cook on site at that venue and that was discovered the day of our wedding.\\n\\nIt took a very long time for all of our guests to receive their dinner. I'm not even sure everyone stayed to eat.\\nIt was upsetting for several reasons, but mostly I don't even know if people think about the stress of planning a wedding and how special a wedding day truly is. The bar Hanovers in Round Rock, that is now associated with Chef Gil, was clueless and unprepared as well. It's a long story that I decided is probably too long for leaving a review, but trust me when I say I didn't appreciate or need the added stress or surprise before and during my wedding.\\n\\nThe CFO of Hanovers, in Round Rock, will try and rip you off regarding the alcohol. \\nIf your venue requires insurance, don't book Chef Gil because then you are forced to use Hanover's Bar Staff.

I ended up handing the reins over to my mother-in-law because I would have completely, and excuse my language, been a total bitch if I had to deal with her any longer.\\n\\nOur wedding was still beautiful and I think the guests enjoyed themselves, but for the expense of having a formal dinner, look elsewhere. I could have used a caterer from our wedding planner, but I had already booked Chef Gil since a friend recommended them.I still could have pulled in the beginning, but the red flags didn't appear until a few weeks before. It was too late to book another caterer, but trust me I would have.\\n\\nI was on the fence of leaving a review all together because I don't like to leave bad reviews for small business professionals. Especially when recommended by a friend, but you know what, I didn't want another couple to have to experience what we did. It's one thing to mess up and it's another thing to do so and not even apologize or offer some kind of a refund.

She rushed the orders out of us even though she never even gave us menus  idk if she was new or what. The wings were half off 10pc and they were good. The pizza we order was not great we didn't really eat it because there was mushrooms on it and we did not order mushrooms due to allergies. The manager offered a plain slice cheese and took $3 off the $20 pizza. The drinks were good.

Frustrated. Those are better words.\\n\\nI work long hours at my job, and typically don't manage to make it out of the office before 11pm or so, and by the time I make it home, its 11:30 to 11:45pm at the earliest. Not a lot open in my area (Rock Creek/Tanasbourne) at that time of night. Old Chicago is nearby, but they get old fast. There are myriads of fast food, but as much as I love fast food, you can only eat so many Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburgers before you are sick of them. So, we (my partner and I) decided to try Shari's. Prior to this my only experience with Shari's was for pie and coffee with family one afternoon.\\n\\nAt nearly midnight, they were fairly busy. At least more people than I expected. We were greeted when we walked in the door and told that someone would be right with us. Right with us turned into 10 minutes when a gentleman came by and told us to sit anywhere we wanted. It was another 10-12 minutes before someone came to our table -- after I tracked down a server and asked if anyone was coming for our order. We ordered sodas. We tried to order dinner but the server said he would be right back. Another 10 minutes. We finally got our drinks and placed our orders -- chicken fried steak for me and pot roast with veggies for my partner. Then the wait really began.\\n\\nAt about 30 minutes they offered us free pie. We both ate pie. At about 50 minutes they apologized again and said they wouldn't charge us for our drinks. We asked several times why there was such a long wait, but never got a straight answer. At a bit over an hour, we finally got our meal. Mine was cold and had obviously been sitting a while. My partner's was fine. We were both tired and starving, so we ate, paid and left. The food was strikingly unremarkable. It could well have been microwaved from a TV dinner.\\n\\nThe only time we got service was when we flagged someone down or literally got up and tracked someone down. Our entire visit was at least two hours, most of it without food. \\n\\nAnd while it was busy, the servers seemed to be just standing around talking to each other. \\n\\nLousy service, bland food, and an unreasonable wait.

Three of us met up here last evening for an early dinner.  It was the first time for all of us.  Hubby, being Italian, can open the door and take a whiff to determine if the food is going to be good.  He gave us a thumbs up.  Antica is a small and charming little place with well spaced tables and booths named for a few Italian regions.  It is not a come-as-you-are tee shirt and shorts place but also not at all stuffy.  It was on the quiet side and made for good conversation.  The employees were speaking Italian to one another as were a couple of customers.  All positive signs of authenticity.  Our server was a professional server and delightful.  We were all VERY hungry, having had no lunch in anticipation of doing serious damage to this menu.  For starters, we had the antipasti for two which consisted of mortadella, pepperoni, two kinds of cheese, English walnuts and olives.  High quality and gone in a flash!  Next we ordered salads...Caesar's and a pere noci Gorgonzola and they followed suit.  All this, so far, accompanied by the wines...Colosi Rossi and Chianti which were both good enough to each have a second glass.  Then came the entrees, which were more than adequate portions.  One had the margherita pizza, one the spaghetti with meatballs and I enjoyed the ricotta e spinach ravioli.  Everything was excellent but the blue ribbon was given to the meatballs.  They were pillows of perfection.  Not kidding here.  We shared a bit of everything among ourselves and agreed that this food is worth every penny.  Not to be stopped by being full, we all ordered desserts and espressos for two and cappuccino for one.  Hubby went for the cannoli which he ALWAYS does in Italian restaurants.  This one received an A+ and he is picky.  The other two of us went for the blueberry and strawberry panna cotta.  Perfetto.  As if all of this had not surpassed food orgy status already, hubby ordered a tiramisu!  Delish.  Our charming server asked if we wanted anything else and I said, \\"a wheelbarrow to the parking lot, please.\\"  I wasn't kidding.  Anyhow, the grand total was $175. pre-gratuity. and worth, as I mentioned previously, EVERY PENNY!  It's a longish drive for us but, we'll be back.  That's a definite.  Bravo, Antica.

The guys at the bar were friendly at first, but soon grew tired after my friends asked some simple questions about beer. They ended up cutting my friends off from shots after two rounds.

Delicious food and excellent service!"},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So this is your mood.  You're thinking: dang, I just want to hit a local dive bar.  I wanna eat some good food, drink some cold, cheap beers, chill out with other like-minded folks. \\n\\nIf I'm right, do yourself a favor and come here.\\n\\nFirst things first: remember that this is a  DIVE BAR.  And that's a compliment from me, as I love me a good dive bar and this fits the bill so beautifully.    Cement floors, patched-up seats, hastily taped-up paper signs advertising things, and graffiti everywhere.  And every bit of it is glorious. Please don't bring your kids here. Or your parents who are in visiting from out of town (unless they're really cool parents).  Come here with your buddy or best girl who has no problem being chill.  Come here if you forgot to brush your hair today or you're still wearing last night's t-shirt and just don't care.  Come here because it's awesome.\\n\\nSO HOW AM I GETTING HERE?\\n\\nJack's is right on Highland just east of downtown in a very little strip building with a couple other restaurants.  There is free parking on the street and bridge, or in the little gravel lot to the east of the building.\\n\\nBut you walking/biking types?  Go this route.  This has such easy access from the Eastside Beltline these days.  The Beltline connects to the Freedom Pkwy Trail (right at the Inman Park juncture) and that Freedom Pkwy Trail runs directly behind Jack's with nice easy access right to the street in front of the building.   \\n\\nMADE IT!  WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?\\n\\nI can't stress enough that you should expect a dive bar experience.  Like things fancy?  Not your place.  Like to check your makeup or hair in the mirror?  Not your place.  (see photos)  ;-)  Get freaked out about single-occupancy bathrooms all genders can use?  Stay the hell out with that close-minded thinking of yours.   Otherwise, come on in and belly up to the bar or grab some table seats (both high and low) around the room.  There is even a covered outdoor area with long picnic tables outside in the back; great for larger groups in nice weather.\\n\\nAND THE PEOPLE?  ARE THEY COOL?\\n\\nEveryone is way laid back and chill.  We sat at the bar and ended up chatting quite a bit with our bartender (who also happened to be the GM, but we didn't learn that until later).   It was early in the day on a Saturday and pretty empty, but I got the feel the vibe pretty much stays the same all the time.  You'll see all types.  Beards. Tattoos. College kids. Sweaty little girls like me who just walked 5 miles to get here.  You get the picture.\\n\\nALL THAT WALKING/DRIVING GETTING HERE MADE ME HUNGRY.  WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\\n\\nGet you some wings.  They come in a boatload of varieties (plain, lemon pepper, bbq, honey bbq, garlic parmesan, strawberry, honey bourbon, cinnamon, chipotle, jerk, teriyaki, medium, hot, on fire, stupid hot, honey mustard, wasabi, sriracha) - or you can mix various flavors together.  They're all done to-order, so come out crazy fresh and hot.  I had the teriyaki and YUM.  I'd get them again.\\n\\nThen again, my friend had the sausage parmesan sub and said it was fabulous.  And I overheard others raving on their pizza, which should only make sense considering the name of the joint.  Going to have to go back and give that there a try.\\n\\nDANGIT NOW,  I'M THIRSTY.\\n\\nGood thing Jack's has all kinds of beers in bottles and on draft, from standard brews to local offerings.  And Miller High Life?  Always $1/draft.  I'm of the mind that a Bloody Mary should always come with a shot of beer (old midwestern tradition).  At $1/draft I had a big ol' shot with mine.  :)  But my bloody mary here was not just a plain bloody either:  they have something called the \\"Bloody Sesamary\\" which infuses vodka with sesame and candied bacon.  Delicious.\\n\\nTHIS PLACE SOUNDS GREAT.  DOES IT GET ANY BETTER?\\n\\nYou wouldn't think it could, but yes!  There are also daily specials written on chalkboard before you walk in the front doors.  There are Sunday drink specials too:  mimosas, bloody marys, the sesamary I mention above, etc..  \\n\\nSo, in conclusion?  Yeah.  Come here.  And when you do, keep an eye out for me because chances are I'll be back there often again.  :)"},{"name":"Flippers Pizzeria","address":"80 W Grant St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I order from this location all the time.

I've tried so many different things on the menu, hoping that one day I'll find something that tastes good. Time, after time, I am extremely disappointed. My last trip I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap because I figured there was no way a restaurant could mess that up... Well Hudson Grille somehow found a way to.\\n\\nThe other biggest issue about this place is their atrocious service. After my first awful service experience, I've been back 3 more times and experienced just as bad, if not worse service then each time prior. There is no reason I should wait 20 minutes for a bud light bottle or more than an hour for nachos. One of two things is painfully obvious: either 1.) the management in this place is not doing an adequate job training their people or 2.) they are terribly understaffed. Either way, the service is flat out deplorable. \\n\\nThis place has so much potential because they have a ton of great TV's which creates a fun atmosphere for games.

We decided to try BLTF as our last hope of finding a place that could accommodate us. Lo and behold, we enter BLTF and in front of us is a long table, empty, that seated exactly 12 of us. \\n\\nLike I said. It was entirely meant to be. \\n\\nI ordered a thai iced tea, papaya salad, red thai curry with roast duck, pad thai, and a side of coconut rice to share. Everything was delicious and good portions for a decent price. The roast duck red curry was my highlight. There were several pieces of whole lychee and many pieces of duck. The consistency of the curry was the right amount of thickness for it to not be goopy, but also not liquidy like broth. I love when the curry is thick enough to grab on to the rice. So flavourful and creamy. \\n\\nThe pad thai was also pretty good. I could maybe skip the papaya salad. Thai iced tea here is only $3... cheaper than other places I've been to. \\n\\nIf I'm ever in the area, I would totally come back here!\\n\\nThe only deduction is the layout/ambience of the restaurant.

Appetizers were good, we had the burrata and arancini, but the busser took away the food when we were halfway through!\\n\\nWe then ordered the boneless spare ribs - and they arrived suspiciously quick. So quick that the waiter was shocked to see it had arrived at our table, and we didn't receive our new utensils yet before it came.

Cute house and nice patio and not far from where I live. First, parking is awful, its not the restaurants fault you have to pay $4.00 an hour to park there, I get that, but maybe they could be more inviting when you come in and not act like they are doing you a favor seating you? Just saying. \\n\\nService! Wow, beyond bad, but we just paid $8.00 to park our cars for a lunch meeting and didn't have a lot of time so we were committed. The server mumbled and was hard to understand, when we asked about chips and salsa he told us we'd have to pay for salsa or said we'd have salsa if we paid for an appetizer so we ordered Guacamole as an appetizer. \\n\\nOur guacamole came out with no salsa so we reminded the server that made us order an appetizer to get salsa and he brought out a tiny lil thing of roasted Tomatillo Salsa reminiscent of what you can buy in a jar at Trader Joes. It was ok, not what I expect at a Mexican restaurant, and where are the other salsas we were expecting? We asked the runner that brought our food after our waiter dropped the 2 tablespoons of salsa in a tiny dish and dashed. We were reminded that if you don't pay $5.00 you don't get any, but he said he'd bring us another type of salsa. He didn't! Isn't that why we bought an appetizer with our meal to have salsa accompany it? Apparently not. We'll never know what the other salsa we were promised tastes like, but judging from the runny roasted tomatillo salsa we didn't finish we're ok not knowing. The guacamole we ordered was ok, it was nothing special and it came with thick very oily chips. Hey owners, you are right across from El Milagro, you should try sourcing your chips from them rather than frying your tortillas in rancid oil and calling them chips. \\n\\nThe Gringas Al Pastor I had was mediocre. Al Pastor is one of my favorite dishes, and I have eaten it in Mexico City, countless places in Mexico and locally I go to Al Pastor on Riverside for their Tacos. Owners, you should try Al Pastor on Riverside. The Al Pastor here was lacking flavor, the Gringas were overflowing with cheese and overly greasy. Grease was literally running down the Gringas when you picked them up. \\n\\nOur server checked in and saw our iced teas empty asked if we needed a refill. Great we thought, he's finally aware and engaged with his table. He brought us a carafe, left it on the table and scurried away. We looked at each other dumbfounded then finally poured our own tea. We also didn't need a whole carafe of tea, it was a waste. \\n\\nAdvice to restaurant owners:\\n\\nEither train your staff better or replace them. \\nCheck out restaurants that serve Mexican food like Al Pastor on Riverside, ATX Cocina, etc. Better yet, maybe visit Mexico.\\nFix your issue with chips and salsa and stop charging people for them. No one should have to pay for those overly greasy chips and mediocre salsa, especially someone paying nearly $30.00 for lunch in a semi clean casual establishment. It is not customary in Mexico, nor in Mexican restaurants in the states to pay for chips and salsa with your meal. Stop nickel and diming your patrons. \\n\\nTruly a disappointing experience and highly unlikely I'll ever go back."},{"name":"Hash It Out","address":"7316 N Lombard","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Do yourself a favor and don't come here.

We started off with the steak tartare and the ahi tuna and I have to say it was probably the best I've had in years! The bartender Asulu recommended it and two of their  signature cocktails that were amazing! Afterwards his recommendation on the tomahawk for two was a great choice, was bone in ribeye for two and with our side items he chose couldn't have been any better! He was very knowledgeable about the menu as well as their signature cocktail menu. They also had a few smoked cocktails with I guess with a smoker or smoke box I guess you could say which had the best presentation I've seen in many years! We were stuffed but had to try the dessert, it was between the creme br√ªl√©e or cheesecake and of course she wanted the br√ªl√©e which was a perfect 10! They also had an amazing salad bar with items you'd never see anywhere else around. It's a beautiful restaurant and everyone there were so nice! We left very happy and will definitely return soon! So if you are looking for a new place with a unique menu then this place will definitely not let u down! When you go, be sure and stop by the bar and see Asulu. He makes an amazing drink and if you're not sure what you'd like I'm sure he'll create a cocktail that you'll probably enjoy more than once! If you stop by and give them a try, I'd bet you'll definitely be back again! Amazing food and staff! Will be back soon!"},{"name":"Zoup!","address":"4971 Tuttle Crossing Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great breadth of soup options.

We split an order of takoyaki, and I got a premium spicy miso tonkatsu ramen for myself. The takoyaki was disappointing. Not a lot of octopus, and the texture was subpar. \\n\\nThe tonkatsu ramen was adequate. I liked the broth, and the noodles had good chew. The meat and the egg were not prepared well. The egg is usually my favorite thing about ramen, but this egg was hard boiled and cold. Just very disappointing. Also, they really skimped on the toppings. I had maybe five bamboo shoots in my ramen. For about $12 a bowl, I expect to be impressed. \\n\\nNow if you've never had ramen on the west coast, then you might enjoy this place.

I was on my way to The Yelpies and severely in need of an energy boost. Thought I scored a bingo when I spotted Foxtail on my route.  I'd been wanting to try them for a while and this seemed to be perfect timing.  \\n\\nUpon pulling in, I wasn't sure they were open because no cars were in the parking lot at 10:30 AM.  Then I noticed someone moving around inside and made my way to the drive-thru.  \\n\\nI ordered a cappuccino, which cost $4.43, and pulled up to the service window.  It felt like I had been waiting a while and I started to wonder what was taking so long, as I was the only customer.  Then another car pulled up to order behind me.  I normally never carry cash, but I'm glad I did today.  The lady who took my order handed me the smallest cappuccino I have ever seen and I handed her a $20 bill and 3 pennies. \\nI know coffee can be pricey and I'm cool with that, but then she handed me back less than $10 and some coins.  I'm starting to freak out a little by now and waved my arms to get the lady's attention behind the closed window.  After I explained that she had given me incorrect change, I was really turned off and dismayed because her tone of voice and body language suggested to me that she didn't believe me.  Her response was, \\"You gave me change!\\"  I still don't know what that means, but knew I was right because I only had five $20 bills on me and explained that to her. Without a word, she held out her hand and I placed the change she had made into it.   Then I waited some more...at least 2-3 minutes...and began to worry that I was going to be late.  The lady returned and gave me my correct change.  Her explanation was that she had charged me for the wrong order...the order belonging to the person behind me.  Mystery solved.  (SIGH)      \\n\\nTook a sip of my coffee as I'm pulling out of the parking lot and it tasted okay, but was not hot.

I'm going back to Disney World!\\n\\n& not only did I go back, but I was there for my birthday! Way back in my little kid days, I celebrated many of my birthdays at the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Getting to celebrate my birthday as a big kid at Disney World would certainly be magical. For the most part, it was, with 1 exception...\\n\\nSince I was staying at Disney's Wilderness Lodge with the girlfriend, I chose Artist Point for my birthday dinner. Artist Point is a Disney \\"Signature\\" restaurant, it's conveniently located inside the  Wilderness Lodge & most of the Yelp reviews for Artist Point are glowing. I figured it was a good bet.\\n\\nWhen making the reservations for dinner, the girlfriend informed the restaurant that it was for my birthday. We arrived on time for our reservation & the girlfriend reiterated to the host & our server that it was my birthday.\\n\\nWe were unceremoniously led to our table & our server was along with menus. For food, I ordered the Cedar Plank-roasted Salmon & the girlfriend ordered the Seared Diver Scallops. The Smokey Portobello Soup was so universally lauded by other Yelpers that we ordered that for a starter. For a cocktail I got a Hendricks Classic Martini.\\n\\nOur food took a long time. Our server, while vaguely friendly in a clueless way, seemed like she was on Quaaludes. Needless to say, my birthday dinner at a Disney \\"Signature\\" restaurant didn't feel very magical.\\n\\nAfter our long wait, our food was presented without fanfare. Yelpers have absolutely gotten it right with the Smokey Portobello Soup, it was fantastic. My Cedar Plank-roasted Salmon had pleasantly interesting flavors from its cooking process but was dry & a little overdone. The girlfriend's Seared Diver Scallops were excellent. My Hendricks Classic Martini was crafted correctly the way a classic martini should be.\\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered a Northwestern Exposure which is a cocktail with Ketel One Vodka, Amaretto, Kahl√∫a & Cream with a splash of Coke. It was nicely sweet & decadent.\\n\\nSo, for food, I would rate Artist Point as a 4 star restaurant. For service, on this 1 particular occasion, I'm deducting a whopping 2 stars. I was at Disney World on my birthday. Almost every Disney experience I've ever had has been about enthusiastic service making an occasion feel magical. There was a certain level of expectation that this would be especially true on my birthday.\\n\\nInstead I got ho-hum service without even so much as any mention of my birthday. I don't need a brigade of servers in sombreros to come over to my table singing happy birthday while clapping, but a couple friendly \\"Happy Birthdays\\" & maybe a cupcake with a sparkler in it would've been nice.\\n\\nThe girlfriend complained to the manager & he basically shrugged. Wow. To repeat the 1st line of  Alicia K's review of this place, \\"I really, really wanted to like Artist Point,\\" but I was let down by some of the most uninspired service I've ever had at any place Disney. Maybe it was just an off night, but that off night was my birthday so it sucked."},{"name":"J & T Market & Deli","address":"4438 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"It's the, \\"oh shoot, pull over, I need to pick up a cheap wine\\" or \\"snack\\" sorta shop. \\n\\nClean, cashier is a cool guy and for a little market, there seems to be a good selection of wine.\\n\\nUsually find myself biking up Glisan, stopping in for beer... they have Black Butte Porter, it's dark and lovely.\\n\\nParking on the street.

Drinks were a bit on the expensive side, especially if we're talking margaritas.  On a late (after 9pm) Wednesday night, Bacardi & Coke was $6, and was a measured pour, most of the signature margaritas were in the $12 to $14 range.  For example, the one I liked best is called the Reverse and was $12.  It's got Grand Marnier, tequila, lime and triple sec; it was pretty tasty but wasn't particularly large or strong, so $12 was a little on the high side.\\n\\nFood was reasonable; our party of three got quesadillas and a few different types of tacos that we all shared; blackened chicken, steak and carnitas.  The quesadillas were a little on the large size from a tortilla perspective since the meat comprised just the middle 70% or so.  Tacos were not that large, taste was good but not really something I'd go out of my way to experience in the future.\\n\\nEdit: Maria M of the restaurant says my review was wrong; my review of the Reverse said it has \\"tequila\\" when apparently it has \\"Don Julio Tequila\\".

It's consistently mentioned as the best restaurant in the Orlando area but I'm not convinced. My boyfriend and I came for dinner during our Disney World trip. We wanted to avoid eating at the parks but I don't think the food here was worth the drive. \\n\\nWe ordered the gruyere biscuits, shrimp & grits, charcuterie appetizer, pub burger, pork porterhouse, and pumpkin creme brulee. The biscuits and shrimp and grits were good but I wouldn't say there was anything particularly memorable about either. The much-hyped charcuterie appetizer looked impressive but definitely didn't live up to the hype. Our waiter mentioned that the pub burger was voted best in Orlando and I have to disagree. I found it to be too salty and heavy and could barely eat half of it. The truffle fries were also a little salty for my taste. The pork porterhouse was huge and had great flavors but was a little too heavy. Finally, our waiter recommended the pumpkin creme brulee for dessert. We shared the dessert which was a little disappointing because it didn't have the creamy consistency that creme brulee should have. \\n\\nOverall my experience here was disappointing. I was disappointed that we left Disney World early and disappointed that we spent over $100 for mediocre food.

The staff, environment, service, and food quality made for such an unexpected and awesome quiet date night. We love this place and are excited to have found some unique and delicious Mexican food near our homes. \\n\\nFirst off, you would never guess that the sketchy looking and little shopping center where Conin is located would be home to such an excellent food experience. It's like the quintessential hole-in-the-wall feel right at the start. \\n\\nThen we were greeted by a super nice and attentive guy that appeared to be running the front of the restaurant. He was casual, not imposing, and the nicest guy ever with solid recommendations when we ask his opinions about some menu items. \\n\\nHe also brought out arguably one of the best salsa and chips in greater Portland area. We happened to be super hungry when we arrived and he brought us out a second round of chips and salsa. Their salsa is different than most of the salsas served in restaurants today. It was spiced in a way that was more akin to seasoning which added a subtle unique flavor. I probably could have eaten buckets of the salsa by itself. \\n\\nThen they brought our double order of Chicken Enmolades. These dishes were excellent. The Enmolades themselves were delicious. They were flavored somewhat differently but definitely but an Improvement over any I've eaten elsewhere. The mole sauce felt more homemade or authentic as did the seasoned rice and lightly pickled veggies on the side. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the meal was that there were no dominant spices or flavors in the dish, they were pleasantly flavorful but nothing overpowered the senses. \\n\\nWe showed up around 6pm and the restaurant was still pleasantly quiet. I don't know if we just went on a slow night or time, but we liked it a lot. \\n\\nFor dessert we reluctantly ordered the churros. Never will we hesitate again. They were fantastic, no more Costco churros for me.  \\n\\nLastly, I was super impressed with how everything was reasonably priced. \\n\\nWe're very excited to return.

This hotel is hosting an event for the Little People of America.\\nThey have a waterslide on property. This waterslide has a sign that reads \\"children under 48 inches tall aren't permitted on this slide\\". They have someone standing at the bottom of the slide with a giant measurement device measuring people as they enter the slide platform, in public view. They are turning away adults over the age of 18 who are able to drink and swim from the slide. This is humiliating to them. I completely understand the safety issue, but management has refused to make any accommodations to address this obvious discrimination. The sign reads \\"children under 48 inches aren't permitted.\\" This implies that adults under 48 inches are permitted. By turning away adults, Hyatt Regency is implying that adults who have a genetic disorder are children. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have offered management four suggestions to mediate this outrageous discrimination. First, I suggested that they change the sign to read \\"people under 48 inches aren't permitted\\", but management refused. I also suggested that they close the slide if they aren't willing to accommodate all of their guests. Next, I suggested that they have a waiver for adults to sign in order to ride the slide and rid the hotel of all liability. Again, management refused. At the very least I suggested that they move the measuring station out of public view in order to humiliate these adults less, but again nothing was changed.\\n\\nTo make the discrimination even more obvious, the sign also reads that there is a weight limit of 300 pounds to go down the slide. They aren't weighing people with a scale. If safety is the main priority, then they should be weighing people with a scale. I offered this suggestion. A manager named Jose said they would put a scale by the height measuring station, but an hour later another manager said they wouldn't be doing that. People over 300 pounds can choose to try to lose weight, but people under 48 inches tall with a genetic disorder cannot choose to grow. \\n\\nI've also heard other stories from people at the convention who have faced other forms of discrimination due to their disability."},{"name":"Five Bucks Cafe","address":"3853 Lawrenceville Hwy, Ste A","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"The guy who took my order was really nice and friendly.

Within walking distance of the newest Orange Line T station, this gathering of shipping containers & tan tent is a very inviting space.  The place was hopping for a Thursday night.  We grabbed a couple of fresh brews & waited for a table to clear.  Within minutes a nice couple offered us their spot.  Even with the cold weather blowing outside the tent was warm & inviting. Caitlin had given me a few free food vouchers also & we took advantage of the privilege. First up was a well appointed charcuterie place with a nice blend of meats, cheeses, crackers & seasonal fruit. Then we had to go for the hot pretzels to get that homemade mustard in my belly. Boy, it did not disappoint.  The pretzel was hot & chewy then the mild mustard added the perfect kick. One of the staff saw me licking my fingers & offered me the spicer variant.  Again, it was a triumph of flavor. So much so I took a little container home. Hopefully they will be selling these soon.\\n\\nThis place is the perfect pre and/or post movie stop.

Both were great and under $5 per slice as well which isn't a bad deal! I love a not-too-oily crust and this was just that. Perfect crisp to it! I peeped inside and it looked very lounge style which is a great place for after work to have a couple drinks and enjoy some pizza and what have you. Great location right down on West Pender as well. Close to the business district and Water Street. If you're looking for a quick fix on your lunch break or you don't have a ton of time to spare then pop by their order window and grab a slice that's right there and ready to go! I only docked a star for the standard types of pizza they had. I tend to like a menu that has a good variety and Goldie's pizza menu (at least when I swung by) didn't have anything too edgy. Your basic Hawaiian, pepperoni and mushroom, chicken, deluxe etc. Some people prefer what's familiar though so this could be a great catch! If you're looking for something out of the box and you love that true Italian wood fired pizza this may not be up to par there but I don't think that's the look Goldie's is striving for anyways!

There was honey butter but even without the butter, the cornbread was buttery and melted in your mouth. \\n\\nWe of course ordered the 2-piece fried chicken meal, which comes with 2 sides. I chose baked mac and cheese, along with broccoli and cheese casserole. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious and had extremely flavorful crispy skin. I loved the crunchiness of the skin and the chicken itself was tender, succulent, wonderful. It definitely was some of the best chicken I have ever had! \\n\\nAs for the sides, the mac and cheese was great- Cheesy and savory, however I wasn't a fan of the broccoli and cheese casserole which came in a mashed ball shaped lump and didn't taste that great. Our waitress noticed I was not happy with it and asked if I wanted something else. I had tried a bite of my friend's fried okra and it took just that one bite for me to be hooked so I ordered the fried okra to replace the casserole.

You may have to park in the rooftop parkade during peak dining hours.

Beverages are always topped up and used plates are replaced frequently. Waiters are attentive without bring intrusive. \\n\\nWhat sets Shu Dao apart from other hot pot restaurants is the dining concept of individual hot pots coupled with consistently high quality ingredients. This means that diners do not have to share the same communal hot pot but instead has the freedom to choose and pick the soup base of their liking. Also, they have a wide variety of soup bases from pork bone broth to mushroom soup to drunken chicken soup to hot and spicy. While I enjoy Szechuan style hot and spicy soup bases, the ones served at Shu Dao (even at the mildest spicy level) are too spicy for me, so I tend to get the pork bone broth instead. \\n\\nThere is a sauce bar where you can be creative in making your own dipping sauce. It's one of the larger sauce bars you will find and I believe it comes at no added cost. \\n\\nHot pot is all about the ingredients, and at Shu Dao the food is always fresh and well presented. Variety is also ample, from all sorts of live seafood like geoduck, lobster and fish to premium meats like A4 wagyu and AAA Angus beef.

We also ordered - Oktapodi which is octopus marinated and then grilled. IT was delicious but for the price (~$12) portion was way too small. For entrees, we order the Athenian Kebob (marinated grilled lamb kabobs), Gyro Dinner (slices of gyro meet on top of a pita break with steak fries), and Stuffed Chicken (chicken breast rolled with spinach and feta cheese filling, over some lemon gravy).

My food was ready and I only had to pay. I was waiting, standing there after spending the whole day hiking in the Rocky\\nMountain National Park. Anyway, when it was my turn to pay, he didn't ask me if I wanted the reward program. I paid and he left before I even finish signing for my payment.

This is the second time that I have been to this restaurant (I live very close to this location). First, let me start off by saying that the food quality is great! The service is where I feel that this restaurant could use some work. The first time we tried this restaurant was on Veteran's Day shortly after they opened.  We arrived and yes they were busy, but they had run out of ribs. (how do you run out of your main dish? On the way out the door I was asked if I was a veteran (Yes) and then they gave me a coupon god for a free meal (that day only).  Thanks!\\nNow this visit was a recent one (02/19) and again they were out of ribs! We decided to give them another chance and ordered other items, and when we got the food to our table it was cold to the touch! To make matters even worse, when I took it back to the counter to ask for the correction, the cook uttered a profanity under his breathe in disgust (I actually heard him as I was standing feet from him. Really? This is how you show appreciation for your customers?

The only thing is the price.  I'm basing it on what I had which was the vegetarian fried rice with mushrooms but there wasn't much mushrooms and it was small for $14 .   It did taste good but it was more like a Chinese flavoured fried rice.  Again I'm kinda complaining about the lack of the only vegetable mushrooms.  Maybe about 5 were cut up to make my fried rice.  As everyone else says , it is a bit pricey here but still the food was quite good!! I just felt kinda sad I had so little mushrooms.  Would I come again?  Maybe if I brought my Instagram friends but for a good down to earth meal, there are so many other choices.   If I pay more I kinda want more.  I don't think my fried rice was organic but then I'm no expert.  \\nOn the plus side my brother and mom like it here and they always recommend it as the new hot Vietnamese restaurant in town!   \\n\\nStaff are very friendly"},{"name":"Boston Kitchen Pizza","address":"1 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My go-to pizza shop in town whenever I'm by Tufts.

For their celebration 1000 Degrees was giving away personal BYO pizzas for free, per customer.\\n\\nMy overall experience was positive. Though it took some time to actually make it in the restaurant, I was pleased by how efficient they were working. When you begin the process of making your pizza, you choose the type and then follow them down the line as they assemble your pizza. \\n\\nTaste - I liked how thin the pizza was, it made it easy to eat but wasn't so thin that everything was falling off. I added a bit of pesto oil to my marinara to give it an extra kick, and found it to be really good. \\n\\nService - The staff here was comfortable in the kitchen and were easy to work with when trying to customize my pizza. I see some reviews mention the awful service, however I cannot attest to that since I did take my food to-go. \\n\\nPrice - Though I did not pay anything in lieu of the grand opening, I could see why some complain. In all honesty though, most places similar to 1000 Degrees, do have similar pricing.

I travel to BC quite a bit, and rely on YELP for dinner ideas, etc.. This place was highly rated, so why not..?? I walked in and sat at the bar.. After waiting 10 min, the bartender emerged. I ordered a Black n Tan. It was finally delivered to me, but as I was about to take a sip, a long hair caught the corner of my eye. Not only did it catch my eye, but it also caught the bartenders eye. Now I have worked in the service industry, and the natural thing (in my eyes) to do, would be to offer another beverage. Instead he said \\"are you ok with that\\"? I channeled my inner pussy, and said \\"no, its fine\\". I then ordered the bangers & mashed... Came out quick and looked pretty good. I dug in like a fat kid would cake. I must mention, that as I was ordering I assume a shift change was in process. A blonde girl came in (I assume the manager named Mackenzie). I say I assume she is the manager because for a good 20 min, I listened to her and the bartender (Jarod) argue about a write up he had received that day. Talk about uncomfortable... It was like when your parents fought at the dinner table. I had to interrupt their battle to ask for the basics (salt & pepper)... The manager delivered, then went back to her battle. I was half way through the meal, and guess what.. ANOTHER HAIR. At this point, I had enough. I waited for another 15 min (while Jarod and Mackenzie fought), before I could say, \\"I'm done\\". When I explained that I found ANOTHER hair, I felt almost challenged. Like I put the hair in myself... Good to know that the bartender came back to tell me\\"dont worry, it wasnt a human hair\\"..

When looking for a place to stay for the night in Orlando I was surprised to see that the rates for this hotel were so low. \\n\\nI had to assume that SeaWorld isn't a popular destination during the winter, and thus I was getting a sweet deal. \\n\\nHowever, upon checking in I was surprised by the amount of nickel and diming and hidden fees that were applied to our bill. Mainly, the resort fee. I'm certain it's somewhere in the fine print that I signed up for, but still it was unexpected. Checking in at midnight I was given a list of all of the elements that the resort fee entitled me to. I asked the front desk person how many of the amenities were available to me at that late of an hour, and I was informed that only the two bottles of water and the wifi. Wow. Thanks. $25 for two 12oz bottles of spring water and wifi access. \\n\\nAfter checking in we went back to the front to retrieve our bags and were informed by the bellhop that once our bags were on their cart, they have to be taken to our room by the hotel staff. What? Seriously? Okay. Well now I'm in for a tip that I wasn't expecting to give. Fine. Whatever. \\n\\nWe made our way to our room and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the absolute size. However, I had a bitter taste in my mouth due to my interaction at the front desk and with the bellhops. I was impressed to see a door handle breakfast menu, but we had unfortunately missed the cut off time to place an order, and when I found that the tea service was $8 it was clear that there was quite the service charge for the convenience. \\n\\nAfter such a long day, we tucked into bed fairly quickly. I hopped on to my netflix to doze off to sleep and attempted to connect to the internet, but found that the logon on menu wanted to charge an extra $10 for connecting. I gave up. I was completely over it. \\n\\nThe next morning I headed down to the front desk to voice my concerns. I was greeted by an extremely pleasant woman named Michelle. Michelle was there to save the day. She listened to my problems, and even explained that although the wifi log on states that it will cost extra money, it's rolled into the resort fee. When I explained how confusing that can be, even to a technically literate person such as myself, she offered to waive the entire resort fee, which made me feel quite a bit better. Truly, the one saving grace of our stay at the Renaissance SeaWorld was Michelle's customer service. She listened to my concerns with focus, addressed my issues, and I left feeling less frustrated.\\n\\nI don't know if I'll ever stay here again. It just doesn't seem worth it if you're simply popping in, sleeping, and popping out. If you're enticed by the rates that you see on various vacation planning websites, be aware that you're likely to spend a bit more than the advertised price. You can weigh out your options and figure out for yourself whether or not the Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld is the proper choice for you."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time I ever saw a dog friendly restaurant!

I can finally say I've been to the Ravenous Pig. I saw a review done for this place by yelp-master Colleen a long time ago, and was always intrigued.  I was in the winter park area on business and was looking from the gps to the different properties lining the street (trying to find my destination) when I saw I was passing right by the Ravenous Pig.  I rubber necked, looking back in astonishment at what I'd stumbled across.  I made the mental note that when I was ready to leave the area, I would have to stop in for lunch.\\n\\n-Fast forward-\\n\\nI cross the two lanes of oncoming traffic and pull into the little driveway.  I expected to find a parking lot but I realized last minute that it is the valet area.  No point in being a cheap-o and trying to back out I guessed. It is complimentary after all.  The gentleman working valet was nice and was happy to finally see a manual transmission car in the sea of automatics he'd been parking.  That had me walking in the front door with a smile and I was instantly intercepted by a hostess. I told her I'd be sitting at the bar and she informed me I was more than welcome to.  I took my seat and at the time there was only one other person at the bar.  The room had a warm welcoming feel, and I attribute it to the brown wooden colors and the smiling faces.  I was given a menu by the bartender and ultimately selected the Oyster and Shrimp Po'boy,fries and a Pint of Lost Coast Ale.  My eyes wandered around while I sipped my Ale, taking in my surroundings.There is a chalkboard on the wall noting the various Ales they have on tap as well as advertising the next pig roast.  There were 2 flat screen tvs in the top corner of the bar area, so I was able to catch up on my sports center.  My presence at the time lent the most diversity to the room aside from one of the bartenders.  Before I knew it my food came out and I was MORE than content.  The Po Boy tasted fresh and hot, second only to my Po'Boy experience in N.O.L.A . The fries were fresh, and crispy and complimented the Po'Boy well.  Add the Ale and you have yourself a delicious lunch.  The bartenders were attentive and even asked what type of napkin I would like based on the fact that I was in business attire for work.  I find little things like that to be telling.  I made sure that since I didn't have any cash that I added the tip for the valet to my card and got it back in cash.  Good thing I did, because when I went to retrieve my car, the valet attendant took OFF! The man was moving like Usain Bolt!  Before I knew it my car was in front of me and I was off!  The Ravenous Pig did not disappoint in any way.  I came in not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  Can you say Clean bathrooms?  I give the Ravenous Pig 5 stars for making my day and giving me a reason to come back.

A Cuban sandwich was okay, but the roast pork was tough and the bread was ordinary. Black beans and rice came as 2 separate items and lacked the complexity or depth of flavors one expects. The chicken fricassee recommended by our server was overcooked (chicken was a little dry) even though it was in tomato sauce. Fried plantains were authentic. Service was friendly but inattentive.\\n\\nI would go back only if I was less than a 5 minute walk away to try other items, just to see if we ordered badly.

There's actually chef-ing (totally a word) going on, which is a thrill to be a part of. And yes, the portions are on the smaller side, but that's what makes it more of a tasting than a gluttonous meal!\\n\\nSad they took the chips and salsa off the menu since my first visit but apparently too many folks sent it back (because it was unique...like a tower/stack vs a bowl). I'd like to start a campaign to bring them back...I'm pretty sure I can get both sides of the aisle to come together on this one! It's a nonpartisan issue, for sure.\\n\\nOutside of that, I love the environment. The service is phenomenal...they must work off a CRM/Salesforce style customer POS because every notation (dietary restrictions, reason for celebration, etc) is made available to every staff member who is running food or beverages to the table. Outstanding touch that really makes you feel more like a guest than a customer. \\n\\nThe burrata bean dip is their sophisticated take on queso and as a bonafide burrata inhaler, I approve. A great way to start off the meal.\\n\\nThe brisket tacos come as a pack of 4 and while some of my party thought they were a tad bit salty, I dig all the sodium, so I loved them. Someone also asked for salsa so they brought out two of their hottest ones, and that was a smart move, so do that, too.\\n\\nThe mushroom tlacoyo was a repeat from my first visit and while I would never order it based on the description alone, it's my favorite thing on the menu. The flavors blend so well together and everyone seemed to be a fan. \\n\\nI almost forgot about the sweet corn! Another fave of the table...the corn is served off the cob and is sweet, but when mixed with the corn dumpling, charred shishito peppers, and the cheese (looks like carrots but was a hard, aged cheddar-like fromage) it cut the sweetness and made for a more savory dish.\\n\\nThe fish a la devil didn't look like the rest of the photos I've seen of it, so I think the presentation has either evolved over the year and/or it really just depends on what is available/fresh that day. It was a solid entree, but I'd recommend going for something a little more adventurous.\\n\\nThe dessert was a bust, but we forced ourselves to order it because we were there, so I think we could have ended with the savory and been supremely satisfied. (They were very kind and took it off our bill even though it had nothing to do with execution and more to do with personal taste.)\\n\\nI went with wine during this visit and wasn't blown away by their red choices (tried three), but I've been during happy hour before and their cocktails are concocted with as much care as their food menu, so I'd recommend going that route. \\n\\n\\"Lucky Hour\\" is every day from 5-6 PM, featuring $5 Snackcidents and $6 cocktails. \\n\\nThey also just started Mezcal Mondays, featuring half-priced mezcal copitas, plus familia pours from featured producers."},{"name":"Cilantro's Taqueria","address":"1427 S Bumby Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"5 STARS BABY.

As I mentioned before, my ordering experience was very pleasant. And when I called back with my issue, the first young man that answered apologized for the cold pizza and offered to have me speak with a manager, but he first asked me what my order was so he could start making a new pie for me.  When the manager got on the phone he apologized and immediately offered to send me another pizza as well. I told him that wasnt necessary, I spent the day at the park and was flying back out at 6am the next morning so I didnt want to wait. But he did issue me a 50% refund bc that's what I asked for. I could've asked for a full refund and I'm sure he wouldve done it, but my goal wasnt free food, I just didnt want to pay full price for cold food. The fact that they were all so accommodating is what sealed the deal for me. The level of customer service was awesome and the situation was handled with care and I appreciate it. To top it off, once I popped my pizza in the oven it taste pretty good. I never had gluten free pizza but this was very tasty, I wouldnt have know the difference if it didnt say it on the menu.

It is even tastier when you add the hot sauce the restaurant offers; but, you will have to ask for it. \\n\\nThe service has usually been good as the staff are respectful and clear tables/fill drinks when needed. Good quality of meat/veggies, good broth, all you can eat, and good service. \\n\\nThe Korean BBQ on the third floor has tasty food, with decent quality of meat. It's all you can eat, so that's pretty awesome. The only huge issue with the Korean BBQ is that the service was terrible in my experience. Not once did my table get checked on. I had to walk up to the waiter multiple times in order to ask for service.\\n\\nOverall, go for the all you can eat hot pot. The all you can eat Korean BBQ, be warned."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service and awesome sushi!

There is plenty plenty of parking and no lines to wait in. The atmosphere and decor inside is quite nice. Service was excellent and quick. I believe the owners are Korean, hence the K-pop music playing in the background. You get your own water and canned drinks. The prices for the ramen are around $10-11. We did not get any appetizers, so note that this rating considers only the ramen. \\n\\nNow to the food and explaining why this has become my favorite place in town to get ramen- the broth is delicious and less salty than the others in town. My dad got the #1 Kanji Signature Ramen, which has pork-based broth, and I got the #2, which was miso-based and spicy. Both were excellent and came with plenty of toppings and noodles. The #1 has a couple of slices of chashu, but mine didn't. I did steal a piece from my dad, and it was okay. Not excellent, but not bad.\\n\\nWe will definitely come back and bring friends here.

But let's face it, there aren't a whole lot out there.\\n\\nThey haven't been open very long, so they have a few things to work out. They are a family run business and still hiring some folks to help them out. When we arrived it was packed! Not a single table open, but they had a few people clear out so we snagged the first table top open. The food took a little while longer than I expected to receive, so keep an open mind if they are busy. They had what appeared to be 1-2 people working in the kitchen. We tried the crispy tofu appetizer and it was good, but next time I'll request no bonito (fish) flakes. I enjoyed my ramen, but I requested a soft boiled egg to add to it which was forgotten. It was brought out later, but I would recommend it being marinated in the soup or something since it was bland and not what I'm used to expecting. I would like to see the tofu in the veggie ramen be cooked/sauteed/ marinated or something. I don't prefer just plain tofu (it's boring and gross but I'm kinda white/beige so), maybe some people do prefer it that way but I don't eat tofu often. I'd want it to be more than fresh soft chunks thrown in.\\n\\nOh yea, you probably want to know about the other 4 ramen options. They've got them. I hear they're good.

The interior decor is similar to Shoya, and when I went in, there was no wait. \\n\\nThe menu itself was large similar to how Shoya loves their large size menu for their customers. When going through the menu, I took it as, \\"Hey guys, we are selling ramen noodles, but we want you to try these mapo tofu (not Japanese) and other dishes that we are experimenting on. Also, you want to try some fried rice and and chili shrimp etc.\\" In other words, the menu was a bit hodgepodge of different cuisines. It contained the ramen noodle theme, but it went off course with random dishes that did not pair well with ramen noodles. \\n\\nThere are two sizes of ramen noodle, regular and premium. Regular can be satisfying for anyone, but if you are the type that want everything bigger, go for the premium. The price for these ramen noodles ranged from 9 dollars to 13 dollars. \\n\\nI tried Yebisuya's \\"premium power tonkatsu ramen,\\" and based on what I tasted, smelled, and saw, I give it a two star - men, I have experienced better. \\n\\nFirst, the ramen noodle bowl was larger, which is fine. It's what I saw, which threw me off from the start. There was no \\"decor\\" or \\"presentation.\\" It was just a big bowl with a lot of broth. Too much broth where the broth buried everything underneath. So, presentation was subpar. Then, I tasted and smelled the tonkatsu aka slices pork pieces. It didn't taste or smell fresh. Most importantly, it was about 50% fat. I am not sure if this was done on purpose, the 50% fat part, to bring more pork flavor, but I didn't think it was a good idea because the broth already showed and tasted oil. So, it smelled old... that old meat smell after you cook it, I smelled it.... then I tasted it... it tasted like a old pork meat. So, that was quite disappointing. The noodle itself was not great either. Usually, you want to serve it at least some what el dente, but this was not the case. The noodles also lacked the proper texture. Compared to the amount of broth and noodles, I got barely any other toppings. I could definitely taste the garlic because the ramen came with garlic chips and all, but the overall ratio of flavor was off. \\n\\nI also tried their curry katsu, and I was very disappointed. The sauce was too salty. The pork cutlet was shocking... half the meat was fat... I felt like the restaurant was trying to compensate the lack of ingredients by overdosing with salt... It was a complete fail. What's funny is that, Shoya's curry katsu don is good, so I don't know what they were doing here at Yebisuya. \\n\\nThe chili shrimp was definitely a dish where you would get it from a chinese restaurant... like I said, Yebisuya had Korean kimchi, Chinese mapo tofu, etc. with their ramens. \\n\\nI think overall, Yebisuya is all over the place with its food, and because it does not have the main focus towards a traditional Japanese ramen, it's dropping the ball compared to other comparable ramen places around the Atlanta area."},{"name":"The One Sushi +","address":"2523 Caldwell Rd NE, Ste 1000","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"My best girl friends and I go to The One every week!

It was a little 4-pointer buck, maybe 80 pounds field dressed, but it was mine and I was excited. \\n\\nTold them I wanted shoulders ground, one leg whole, and one leg cut into steaks. I also said yes, I'd like my antlers back. They said it'd be ready in a couple days. \\n\\nFour days later and I hadn't heard back, so I called and got \\"oh. yeah, that's ready.\\" Cool. So now I have to drag ass down there on the day before thanksgiving, and stand in an enormous line to get my deer if I want it for holiday dinner.  \\n\\nSo I get there 5 minutes before opening, and discover a ten person line and 4 people behind the counter, already working...not so briskly. My turn comes up and the guy, I think he's the owner is like \\"what?\\" and I'm like, \\"I'm sorry?\\" and he gets irrritated and says \\"what do you WANT?\\" And I say \\"I'm here to pick up a processed deer.\\" \\n\\nDude rolls his eyes and stomps off into the back, slamming the door, which is a heck of a trick with commercial swing doors. He disappears for like ten minutes, and comes out with a taped up box with frost collecting on the outside. Cool. Frozen deer legs. That'll thaw out super quick. He stomps out around the front of the counter, throws the box on the floor at my feet, and snarls a number at me. I don't hear him, so he snarls louder and says \\"LEAVE IT ON THE COUNTER\\" and goes to \\"help\\" the next customer. \\n\\nSo, since nobody's giving me change and I want out, I over-pay by five bucks, grab my box of frozen, flung-down, disrespected deer pieces, and go.

My experience has been that they're mediocre and overpriced. Thunder Falls Terrace at Universal's Islands of Adventure easily surpassed my meager expectations. \\n    I had some kind of salad with chicken. (Give me a break here. It's been five weeks now since my visit.) It had a bunch of healthy ingredients, which was what I was looking for. It was nice and fresh and a big ol' Heap of food.

We had to stand for maybe 15 minutes, making our way through a couple of amusement park ride style switchbacks before we even got up the counter. This likely had everything to do with not one but two restaurants being closed in the adjacent Toon Lagoon area. Not directly the fault of this restaurant, but some kind of staffing/organizational issues no doubt. \\n    Once we got up to the counter the workers were friendly and energetic.

He enjoyed his. My friend did mention that he wished our eggs were runny instead of being boiled eggs. \\n- TAKOYAKI ($5.95): comes out fresh and pipping hot. I usually try to split them in half so that they don't burn my mouth. Each ball comes with a small octopus tentacle. There are six balls per order so let's say $1 for each ball. The balls are drizzled with BBQ sauce and topped with fish flakes. There is mayo on the side for dipping. I would say these are pretty standard in taste and texture. Satisfied my cravings for takoyaki. \\n- MINI SAUCE KATSU DON ($5.95): ordered this as a combination order with a purchase of a noodle dish. The katsu don consist of two palm sized lightly fried pork cutlets served with rice topped with cabbage and a special sauce. I was really surprised that the fried cutlets had flavor and was juicy. I guess it was juicy because there were fat parts in the cutlet.\\n\\nOverall, I do see myself coming back to try more of the items on their menu since it is located closer in distance to me than Jinya."},{"name":"Saltgrass Steak House","address":"8850 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow.

It couldn't have been more than a half inch thick, maybe a six ounce portion.  The waitress had described it as a filet mignon, which at close to $30 I expected to be a little more generous.  The potatoes were different (in a good way) and a little sweet so I asked about them and it turns out they're Yukon Gold potatoes mixed with a white Cuban potato which is slightly sweet.\\n\\nThe tuna was cooked to order (rare in this case) and served topped in a cilantro puree and on top of a mix of edamame, corn, tomatoes, and green beans in a broth.  Without the cilantro puree, the dish would have been very bland as there didn't seem to be much seasoning on the fish and little in the \\"stew\\", but together with puree which had a nice garlic taste to it, it got the flavor it needed.\\n\\nThe desserts are a selection of five different tasting combinations that again appear to be something that can be prepared in advance or at least quickly.

This small Jamaican restaurant has some very good jerk chicken and oxtail, but I think the food is a little overpriced.\\n\\nThere are $5.99 and $6.99 lunch specials, but the only meats you get to choose from are brown stew chicken, curry chicken, and fried chicken.  The brown stew chicken and the curry chicken consist of small, bone-in chunks of chicken soaked in sauce.\\n\\nThe good stuff is on the regular menu, where combos are priced at $8.50-$9.50 for a medium combo and $10.50 to $13.50 for a large combo.  Menu items include the aforementioned jerk chicken and oxtail, baked chicken, curry goat, and stew peas.  You can get any three meats for $15.00.\\n\\nThey also sell roti, fish, and shrimp.  In addition, Jamaican patties (beef, chicken, veggie, spinach, jerk) are only $2.00 a piece.  These seem to be the best value.  Sides include rice (different varieties), plantains, mashed potatoes, steamed cabbage, yellow yams, green bananas, and more.\\n\\nThere's no tap water, so if you want water, you'll have to purchase a bottle of Dasani for $1.00.\\n\\nMost of the food is already prepared and sitting in a serving line next to the cash register.  The medium combo is plenty of food for one person.  It includes rice and beans (or just white rice -- your choice), steamed cabbage, and your meat.  You can also get gravy poured on top.  I like the oxtail gravy, even with my jerk chicken.\\n\\nThe jerk chicken is very good, perhaps some of the best I've had in Atlanta.  Yes, it's that tasty.  The meat is quite tender and the skin/seasonings flavorful.  They did an excellent job with this one.  The oxtail is also pretty good.  Oxtail has a fatty, tendon-like consistency, so it's not for everyone.  The sauce they use for the oxtail has a unique, aromatic, and smoky flavor.  Some what indescribable, but it's savory.  I recommend both.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a hearty snack, try one of the patties.  They're like Hot Pockets, but much better and freshly made to order.  The beef patty seems to be the most popular.  The consistency of the beef inside the bun is finer than taco meat.\\n\\nService is good.  The meals are served instantly off the line in Styrofoam containers with disposable silverware.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small and not entirely conducive to dine-in eating due to the limited amount of seating (a few small tables and bar-height seating around the windows).

As always I like to begin with customer service. I was within walking distance from my hotel to Saltgrass and I was in the mood for a steak  so here I am. The reviews were mixed but whatever the place looked good. The place wasn't too busy for lunch which I liked. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile by a server named Ms. Carish. We talked about the food and the steaks that they served. During that time we were joined by a smiling Ms. Bianca who turned out to be my server when I was seated. Both were very knowledgeable about the food and assured me that my concerns about a how I liked my steak would be met there. Ms. Bianca asked me how I was doing then kindly walked me through the menu on their specials. I settled on the 10oz Pat Ribeye with a Caesar salad (with was large and one of the best I've had for real!) with garlic mashed potatoes. For checking in through Yelp I also received a free tap beer. \\n\\nThe food was good!!! My steak was a little above middle just as I asked and tender. Char was just right and both the mashed potatoes and steak was hot and seasoned nicely. They also serve hot bread that comes free. All in all I had a great meal in a nice restaurant while watching sports from my booth. The customer service from the staff was great so you can't go wrong. Hope this helps and I hope your experience is as good as mine or better.

I've now been there three times and had 2-3 drinks each time. The upstairs bartenders (especially Shane) are awesome, but the downstairs crew are awful. And the pours are way too skimpy.

She had to sit across the table facing the wall. We switched but the manager's rudeness was a big influence on the evening.  Our waitress, Melissa, arrived quickly and was very friendly.  She took our drink order (a few glasses of wine), delivered them quickly and provided suggestions for dinner.  We ordered quickly and that was the last we saw of her.  Miscellaneous people waited on us after that, and a gentleman kept our water glasses full all time.  We ordered their Pollo Pizzaiola and Baked Gnocchi with Wedding soup and Caesar salads for starters.  Starters were good, but nothing special, and our entrees weren't much different.  Gnocchi didn't have much flavor and was not anything I would order again. Pollo Pizzaiola was ok, but again, neither had us thinking we would return here.  \\n\\nFor us, the experience was choppy.  Mixed service, rude manager, average food. For us, there are too many good places with great service and great food to return here.

The service was absolutely horrible!  You had one waitress in the lounge, in addition she was serving the people in the larger area past the doors/bar area.  She was so busy that a regular guest that frequents the lounge brought me and my party silverware, place settings, tea and duck sauce.  It also took over a half an hour to get our order and drinks in.  Then another half hour to receive our check.  The service over the past years have gone downhill.

This place is nothing short of amazing and alleviates the need to drive to downtown Portland to get my fix. We were seated promptly after arriving and ordered drinks. I ordered an Oktoberfest beer that was basically large enough to fill two glasses for only $6. My husband's cocktail was simple and strong. The atmosphere was slightly upscale with exposed brick, candles, and dark features.\\n\\nWe ordered two pork rib dishes with pasta, peppers, and zucchini. I was really happy to see there was a vegetarian option as well. We also ordered a plate of ham croquettes to split. The croquettes were pretty tasty though there was maybe only one tiny piece of ham per piece; I think they could get away with making them vegetarian without a change of taste. The pork dish really shined. I usually opt to go vegetarian or fully porkified, so I've tried no shortage of fancy pork dishes over the years. This dish is among my favorites. The pork was a mix of tender melty pieces with crispy edges. Paired with homemade pasta in a slightly spicy porky wine sauce, it was fantastic. My husband ate every bite, even the pepper stems.\\n\\nWe don't usually go for dessert, but everything else was so damn good, we said the hell with it. The pumpkin cheesecake was ridiculously delicious. The best pumpkin dessert execution I've come across. Moist, creamy, and pumpkiny with a sugary crust. \\n\\nI want this place to stay forever. We've found our fancy date night spot without having to leave town. Two entrees, an appetizer, two drinks, and dessert cost us less than $80. It's a similar quality to Le Pigeon or Little Bird, but with a slightly lower price tag. Our only critique (and it's a small one), is that we would have enjoyed bread with the meal. We saw some come out to another table as we were finishing and were a tad salty we weren't offered any.

When my sister told a staff member we had a reservation, someone then went over to a few tables by the restroom and set up our 6 top.  \\n\\nAfter what seemed like an interminable wait (perhaps because the area in which we were waiting was so cramped and we constantly had to shift around to accommodate traffic), we were seated.

Then, when we ordered, he was very dismissive of one of our companion's questions.  During the middle of our dining experience, he swung back by the table and actually smiled and inquired about how we liked our food.  After he ran my credit card, it seemed like an invisible cloak had been cast over our table.  One man, who wasn't our server, offered to add bread to our to-go bag.  His pleasant demeanor was much appreciated.  \\n\\nThe food itself was just okay.  The calamari was the best appetizer we ordered.  The escargot was decent, and the stuffed mushrooms were terrible and came out of the kitchen cold.  Two of our friends ordered spaghetti as their entrees.  The food looked disgusting, and they assured us it tasted that way, too.  The fettuccine alfredo and lasagna were acceptable.  The best entrees were the scallops and shrimp liguria and the sea bass special.  I had the scallops and shrimp liguria.  The pasta underneath the seafood was a little oily, and the scallops and shrimp were slightly overcooked and tough.  The sea bass was the only entree cooked to perfection.  My bite of that was the best food I had all evening.

It was a singularly frustrating experience.\\n\\nDespite there only being in 2 people in front of me, it was 10 minutes before I could order. There was a full staff, so that wasn't a problem. The employees making the pizzas were so, so slow. As the man before me was ordering, half way through he looked back at me with the same look of astonishment that I had. Spreading the sauce took about 30 seconds, so it was perfectly distributed across the dough, arranging the cheese took about a minute, like it was a painting bound for the Louvre, and finally, putting the pepperoni on one-by-one, which took another 30 seconds. \\n\\nFinally, 25 minutes into my experience, my pizza finally made it to the oven. I've been to these kind of places before, so I was surprised when I saw that the guy manning the oven kept rotating the pizzas past the 3 minute mark. Like, minutes past. He was monitoring them closely, but clearly not effectively. Both of my pizzas came out burned. I could smell them across the room.\\n\\nI tried flagging someone over, but no one would come over to me. I asked the cashier if he could speak to them, and he looked very confused. 2 minutes later someone came over to tell me they were going to remake the pizzas. I told them not to bother, that I was going to leave, but they insisted, and so I waited another 5 minutes as they held up the rest of the line to remake mine. At this point, I walked over, to find that they put sausage on the BBQ chicken pizza I ordered. It's off of their own menu! I couldn't believe it. When I mentioned that it was supposed to be chicken, not sausage, the employee got chicken and put it on top. Didn't apologize, didn't offer to make it over or remove the sausage, simply put the chicken on top.\\n\\nI promptly thanked them and told them not to bother making them again. I left. No pizza, no apologies.\\n\\nFor those who are willing to stand for 40 minutes for a pizza (with no line), know that the pizza concept here is similar to a Blaze.

This employee pointed out to me that they are not an Italian restaurant who usually serves bread. I told her that 99% of the restaurants I've been to in my life, American, Italian, and so forth have never charged me for bread. The bread usually comes with the meal. \\n\\nBecause of the the unprofessionalism of the management of this  establishment plus the immaturity and lack of knowledge that comes with running a restaurant my friends and I will now not even go there socially !\\n\\nHasn't this restaurant ever heard of that expression \\" THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT !!\\"...This person didn't want to hear what I was saying but kept trying to defend the store's policy.

Traffic in Atlanta doesn't allow for those living OTP to get downtown easily. With an hour drive just to get to Buford Hwy so I could take local all the way down and 45 minutes to go... Closing time was upon us (7PM?? Who eats dinner that early, EVER?) so we got our friend who was working out of midtown to pick up fried chicken for us to-go. She ordered us 6 fried chicken dinners, with two sides each. I ended up choosing the mashed potatoes and creamed corn as my two sides and it came with some corn bread. The fried chicken came with two pieces of dark meat, per my request. The total was about $14 for the meal. I vaguely remembered another famous fried chicken venue that offers FOUR piece fried chicken with two sides for the same price... Ahem, Mary Mac's.\\n\\nAs we dug in to our food, I noticed the dark meat was a little dry and the skin not super crispy. I know it was mostly due to the fact that the chicken was sitting in a steamy styrofoam casket of death. The mashed potatoes were ok, but tasted like they came from a box. The cornbread was SUPER dry and crumbled at a single touch. It was so chalky in my mouth, I couldn't finish the small piece of bread. The creamed corn wasn't bad (really, the only saving grace), but it wasn't mind blowing, either. And through all the complaints we had, I knew I couldn't base Busy Bee's review off of a single take-out experience.\\n\\nHowever, until Busy Bee Cafe can prove to me in person how great they REALLY are, I can't give them a 4 or 5 star for the \\"Best Fried Chicken in Atlanta\\" that they claim to have."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I didn't get a chance to take any pictures of my food...

We also got the shrimp tostada which was delicious as well. It had some fruit, shrimp, and avocado on top. The beet tostada was great because I loved the infusion of the vegetables with the crunch of the tortilla, all blended with avocado. The tacos were also amazing, although a little difficult to share. My other favorite was the winter squash y butterleaf. It was a great blend of flavors, both fruity and crunchy. I enjoyed the migas as well. I don't think it looked very appetizing, but it tasted great. The entomatas were also good, I loved the crunchy tortillas mixed in. I also liked their brunch cocktail menu. They had some unique items on it, although I ended up going with a standard mimosa.\\n\\nThey were sold out of several items, which was very frustrating because some of them were items that we really wanted to try. For example, they sold out of all of their pastry items, as well as the mole flautas.

My gf got the shrimp and grits ($15) and I had the fried oyster po'boy sandwich ($14). I'd say the shrimp and grits was the better selection. The shrimps were quite big and cooked just right. The grits were also flavorful when mixed with the shrimp juice / gravy. \\n\\nThere was nothing wrong with my sandwich, but it didn't really excite on any levels. Five smallish fried oysters on a toasted baguette with some mayo and Safeway greens. The sandwiches all come with Cajun fries (fries sprinkled with Old Bay), but I received a basket of mostly tiny end pieces and nubbins - it was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nI wish I could give separate scores for food and service.\\n\\nSince Chewies is an open-kitchen restaurant, the interior gets *VERY* loud.

Waited forever for someone to acknowledge we are at our table. Then we didn't get my Jalape√±o Cornbread with my Grilled Steak Carne Asada which also was very good! Then after asked by three times for my Cornbread it came out loud owing nothing like it ever does. The cook obviously did something wrong. They. Always have a crunchy top these had none. If you have a history of providing a product consistency that people come to expect then you have a situation that you can't provide what people come to expect then don't provide it!!! DA! We also just found out that they have no policy for chips and salsa.... they let each server decide whether they bring it or not! Ours decided as he said not to. He said, its tougher to upswell appetizers if customers get full on chips and salsa. Well our point is we should have been offered it instead ovus wondering what's going on. And then we asked for salsa and that was like pulling teeth. Anyways. This place has always had poor service!! But we still go for good food (except the tacos) and atmosphere.  \\n\\nThey still use Taco Bell paper napkins!!! Really????\\n\\n\\nThey still use Taco Bell Napkins!!!!!!! \\n\\nWell after reading some of the negatives I realized that there are a lot of people who live around here that have no concept of attending a good restaurant. I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to upscale restaurants when clearly they Should be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! Let me speak English clearly. You don't take children to upper scale restaurants. The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse a baby crying! OMG that one really takes the cake. Some people just have no class. Let's get off the subject of the ignorant nay sayers or neg bags. \\n\\nThe fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for a more upscale customer (not families, children or dogs!) thank God. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to make is the ambience is fantastic, from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street side on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would even further help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on how they were putting their goods together. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. I've been all over the world and the only upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, and Irvine CA and they have valet service as well. The food was good. I like how they allow you to have on sone items various options with a variety of flavors and spices. The Queso was just ok it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it have less bean dip and a lot more Queso. With the Street Taco's they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 taco's 1 type of meat per taco. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsa's and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalape√±o Corn Bread. This plate was amazing. At the end of the day I told my wife, \\"Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience\\"? Most people take pics of the food. I never understood that. To me it's all about the atmosphere. But, then my wife and I like the nicer places wherever we go. Not everybody does not can appreciate them either. \\n\\nWe just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!\\n\\nOh, and we'd like to thank Carah our server.

For example, one wall has several large black-and-white portraits of big stars from the 1960s (Tom Jones, Star Trek stars, Sean Connery) and such other things as black velvet paintings.  Truly fun items.  In the end, the atmosphere reminds me of basement rumpus rooms in the 1960s (a little hard to admit, but I do remember rumpus rooms).

For seafood I usually only get the shrimp bc I've never had a problem before. The salmon is a hit or miss bc sometimes you can see that it's not that fresh and it comes out pretty dark in color. The meat is okay, I usually get the choice rib eye (fatty beef) and beef tongue back which is also a hit or miss bc sometimes you can get a super tender part or a super chewy part. Another reason I like this place is bc they offer the fried bean curd sheets which tastes so good when eaten with the meats. Other places offer the roll version which I'm not a fan of.

I ordered the original stromboli as carryout and went to pick it up at the Westerville location.  As I walked in, I expected to be greeted by the aroma of fresh garlic and hot pies baking in the oven; however, the smell of the mustiness of a cheap Myrtle Beach hotel smacked me in the face!  In addition, the place should be labeled a bar, not a restaurant.  It was noisy and loud and not a place I would care to sit down at and enjoy a romantic dinner.  So as I made my way to the bar, like a mouse in a maze, I caught the attention of the bartender.  I go to show her the Groupon on my phone and she immediately interjected and stated that it is for dine-in only.  This is something I admit that I overlooked, so I asked to just be given credit for the $5 I paid for the Groupon.  As empathetic as a bartender normally is, she refused that completely reasonable request as well..  I regrettably bowed down to the Groupon Nazi and paid for my stromboli and dodged my way back out the door.  When I made it home, I began to graze on the stromboli..  I found that it was a bit greasy, but not too bad (Antonio's is significantly better).

The Lynn building is a dilapidated excuse for an antique setting so much so that the ceiling was leaking onto my daughter because it was raining outside (and in). Not funny......The dingy room is poorly lit but enough light for you to see the mold growing on the 'stucco' walls and the giant clusters of cob webs floating above your head on the rafters!  The floor is terribly tilted and my chair had a sharp broken wooden slat visible on the back which could tear your clothing and should have been repaired or thrown out.\\n\\nService was meh, one server for the whole restaurant and a few bus kids helping out....nothing was the fault of the server who was efficient and friendly, but seriously, if a guest in Your establishment has a leaky ceiling dripping down on them, I think more could have been done than to ask if the drips went into your water glass!

It's like meeting a soul mate only to discover that they had been living in your neighborhood for years, and visiting the same hairdresser. I might be in love??\\n\\nThe minute you walk in the door you feel at ease. It is perfectly decorated and lit. The restaurant is formal but not pretentious--you will feel at home in nice t-shirt (keyword \\"nice\\"--leave you AC/DC concert shirt at home please). \\n\\nThe bar is gorgeous with deep wood accents and towering beer casks just to drive home the point that the beer is for real. \\n\\nThe service is impeccable from host to bartender to waiter (oops, I hate to be so brashly un-PC--server). \\n\\nBut as I have said many times, all of that would mean nothing if the food was not good. It would be like meeting the aforementioned soul mate only to find out that they had a terrible hidden secret, a fatal flaw that would only be made apparent over time; like they were a vegetarian or liked country music. \\n\\nFortunately that is not the case--the food is awesome! We started the meal with a round of shrimp tacos that were perfect in their simplicity. I then ordered an appetizer simply called \\"Bread.\\" It was--bread, a very delicious medley of bread with butter. Though it sounds like something that should have been delivered gratis to the table, this was definitely a step up from your average bread basket. \\n\\nFor the main course a friend and I split the enormous pork porterhouse and the steak frites. Both were amazing but I think the Porterhouse edged out the competition. Beware however that this entree is a commitment. Not as big as a new puppy but more demanding than say, a goldfish. \\n\\nFor dessert I had the coconut black pepper ice cream. It actually comes in a trio of flavors but I just wanted three scoops of the coconut black pepper. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this may have been the best thing I have ever tasted.

The food is delicious, many varieties of tacos being the mainstay. These are street style fusion tacos.  Though people are calling them two bite tacos, they are more substantial than that. More like 4-5 bites. I had the the shrimp banh mi taco for lunch and along with a small guacamole, it was an appropriate size lunch. For dinner, I'd do the small guacamole for one or the large to share and a plate of 3 tacos. It would be a substantial dinner.\\n\\nI have not tried the alcoholic drinks yet but they were pretty on the other tables and varied and I hear they are delicious. They certainly sound it from the descriptions. I had the unsweetened Pekoe black tea and it was very fresh tasting and refreshing. Get the carafe, even for one, it's smaller than you would guess and then no one needs to come refill.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the unusual approach to service here. They seat you, but you fill out a preprinted ticket for food and hand it to the server. Sort of like happy hour sushi places around Boulder. If you want help later for refills or anything you put a flag up on the stand at your tables. You can hand over another ticket for more food or have something refreshed or to get your bill. Different but it seemed to work. Anyone who sees the flag will come right over. Otherwise they don't bug you to reorder or hurry and yet they are not ignoring you. In theory this should work great to be left alone to converse with friends uninterrupted and so far it seems to be a decent balance.\\n\\nI did have the key lime dessert. It too is different in style but classic in taste. Comes in a glass, so deep layer of key lime on top of a solid layer of Graham crust. In this case, very solid. I struggled to get a spoon through it, I was observed and immediately approached by a staff member. Apparently it is supposed to be scoop-able, all the parts Including the whipped cream top and plenty of lime zest in each spoonful. Today, it appears someone packed the crumbs too tightly before baking and chilling too firmly before layering. Like digging into a hard cookie. But very tasty and I loved graham crusts so I was diligent. Lots of apologies all around and I did believe they would try to be more careful with new workers' technique.  They offered to replace it but I did not need it. The table next to me though, did eat the top layers and leave behind the crust.\\n\\nAs far as tables next to each other, it's pretty densely packed. Don't expect a conversation to remain private.\\n\\nI will definitely return. I saw so many cool taco flavor options to try.

I'll keep this short, but the bartender and waitstaff are a %^&* nightmare. It took about ten minutes to get a beer -- and we were sitting at the bar!! Finally, a cold beer was poured, as if doing me a huge favor. I drank it, and waited the 30 minutes for the bartender (who was right in front of me) to refill it. He ignored me. I put the cup right near the edge of the bar, and he continued to ignore me -- talking to the waitresses, hanging out, having a great time. Every time I looked his way he looked away. It was...strange. The barback (?), a girl, did the same. Finally, another guy came over. I wasn't even sure if he worked there, but I asked him for a beer. He looked surprised, then filled it up. The original bartender NEVER CAME BACK TO ME. From then on, as we ate some average, overpriced pizza, it was on to the barback. And, she ignored both of us. When I finished my second beer, she came over, took my glass, and washed it. I tried to ask for a beer and she walked away. This was becoming funny because it was so ridiculous, but when my girlfriend finished her wine, she did the same thing -- took the glass, washed it, ignored us, walked away. I talked her into pouring me a beer again about another 30 minutes later, but by then, I was sick of watching the waitstaff open wine for themselves, do shots of Fernet, and generally be jackasses. \\n\\nThis place is LOSING MONEY FAST. I would've had a bunch of oysters and 5-7 beers. Instead I had 3 beers and a crappy pizza (yes, I went down from average, the more I remember), and I learned that I would rather sit on my own roof with a six-pack. DO NOT GO HERE.

The food (sandwich & salad) was quite good, though it seems to be more expensive since I last tried it. The coffee seems to be the same brew as offered at the partner cafe, Diesel, in Davis Square. It's competent, but doesn't blow me away. The location, just outside Union Square is fabulous. The remodeling of the former bank is somewhat successful, if not a bit quirky not making the most efficient use of space. I wouldn't object to dining in the former vaults if it were not for the obvious association with Block 11 barracks at Auschwitz where one means of torture/execution was to lock prisoners into an airtight room either in a large tight group or with candles burning until the oxygen in the room was depleted. \\n\\nI have had a previous review deleted by Yelp, at the request of the owners of Diesel/Bloc 11, I am sure, allegedly because it did not meet the rules of reviewing, though as far as I know it did, but I am trying again. I really did eat and drink here and have visited it on other occasions. I don't see why part of my review shouldn't be about why I find the name of the cafe offensive and the failure of the owners (also the owners of Diesel Cafe) to change the name insensitive. \\n\\nThe story is about a barracks at Auschwitz known as \\"Block 11\\" and frequently referred to as the prison with the prison. It was used for torture and execution and it's courtyard was used for firing squads. Among its most notorious achievements was that Block 11 was used to test Zyklon B gas as an alternative to diesel exhaust for extermination in the gas chambers of concentration and annihilation camps run by the Nazis. From that point forward, Zyklon B became the Giftgaz used throughout the system for the extermination of Jews and others. \\n\\nApparently the name \\"Bloc 11\\" was made in total ignorance of the notorious barracks. Soon after the opening of Bloc 11, this association was made known to the owners. Something has been made of the difference between the word \\"Block\\" and the word \\"Bloc.\\" But, among other things, in French (and some other romance languages) the barracks is known as Bloc 11. Also it sounds the same. Does one letter really make a difference? Would you feel better coming to my \\"Klu Klux Kafe\\" rather than the more correct \\"Ku Klux Kafe\\"? I doubt it. Since the owners have been made aware of the similar names and have not changed it, I can only describe this as being insensitive to those whose lives have been tragically touched by the Holocaust. \\n\\nI no longer spend my money either at Diesel or Bloc 11. I think the owners need to become more enlightened as to just how strong and distasteful the imagery of the notorious prison in a prison, Block 11, is to a certain group of people. I am still optimistic that they may change the name and perhaps mount some sort of education about Block 11 and Auschwitz as part of the story as to why they changed their name. In any event, the name change is now very long overdue."},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Perhaps it's a different experience at the weekends, but we usually come during the week and we always have a great time.

I knew there were few locations in and around Atlanta, but when I saw the construction for the Tucker location I was thrilled!

I had to change my order and I felt a bit rushed in doing so. Ultimately, my alternate order was just OK. A few weeks later, I returned to place my original order, but they said I would have to wait 15 or more minutes for the white meat chicken to be made. I left and have not returned.

It's a bit out of the way, and may not look like much, but at the end of the day you're there for the tacos and they be gooooooooodddddddd. The long and short of it:\\n\\n1. Tacos: Breakfast tacos. Non-breakfast tacos. Vegetarian tacos. Tacos with cactus. Bowls..... which are like deconstructed tacos. Lots of variety which is always nice to see. 2 tacos were plenty for everyone (I had 3 because I'm a glutton). Everything was tasty and fresh. Worth a try over other Austin taco trucks.\\n\\n2. Price: 2 tacos and a bottle of water ran $9 which works for me and for what you get. We had tacos that were cheaper, as well as ones that were more expensive, so mid-price + quality = a good taco deal.\\n\\n3. Wait: Granny's is pretty popular and they seem mostly made to order, so a pretty sizeable line will likely have formed outside when you get there. It may take a bit to get your food, which was the only negative part of the meal. Usually this wouldn't deter me but there are a lot of really good tacos in Austin, so Granny's would only be my main choice if I was in the area/had time to wait. Worth it if that's your case.\\n\\n4. Location: A bit out of the way but not un-walkable distance from 6th st. Make the journey if you're in the area.\\n\\nGranny's was a shining light in the endless sea of taco trucks in Austin. Not so much better that others we tried to go out of our way, but we were in the area and it made for a great taco brunch. Worth a try!\\n\\nOverall Grade: B"},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Service was aweful and slow and the coffee was just over priced milk....never again"},{"name":"Noor Mediterranean Grill","address":"136 College Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I came down the hill for lunch a few weeks ago, after a friend had suggested Noor.

Totally ADD, I wasn't willing to wait and we went elsewhere. \\nThis time, I had the foresight to have 2 friends go early to grab a table for our large group. Not for breakfast, but for happy hour before Last Thursday. \\nWhile most of us were there for happy hour, some of our group knew exactly which dinner items were fantastic and opted to go that route. \\nOne really, really yummy dish my friend ordered was the Baby Beluga. I may not be a fan of mushrooms, but they were big enough that I could pick them out. It consists of lentils, avocados, veggies, sweet potato's, onion & garlic, over rice with a curry sauce. Don't knock it til you try it! \\nI ordered the mac-n-cheese ($4) from the happy hour menu. I didn't know it'd be Cajun, but love anything spicy, so it was a pleasant surprise. I also got their side salad - which comes sprinkled with hazelnuts. I chose the bleu cheese & wasabi dressing. You have to like stinky cheese and spice...but if you do, as I, you'll love the dressing! Lastly, I got a tall boy PBR for only $2.50. \\nAs for the restaurant itself, they have a fabulous courtyard - which we chose to sit out at. During the winter months, you can enjoy outdoor dining under the covered area. I believe they even have heat lamps, so you can pretend it isn't cold and rainy out. \\nThe best part of our 2.5 hours spent at Tin Shed cafe was our amazingly sweet server. She got all 15 of our orders right and let us split our bills. She also took some group photos for us, happily. I didn't get her name, but she was working outside last night (8/30/12) and was wearing pig tails.

I'm generally very empathetic when a restaurant makes a mistake, but under-cooking chicken is the one mistake that can't be made, as it can lead to customers getting very sick.\\n\\nI didn't notice at first because the outside was charred, and the first few bites tasted a little juicier than normal, but looked white. But then I got to the middle and noticed it was entirely pink. The waitress immediately got the manager, who was apologetic, made me a new meal, and didn't charge me for the salad. The only way the chicken could be that charred on the outside and raw on the inside is if it wasn't defrosted.

Bruegger's is consistent and well-managed. I always say that they have the hottest coffee in Columbus. On top of that, their playlist is always poppin', featuring all the pop songs I grew up on. It is clear that their marketing strategy is geared towards college kids like myself. \\n\\nI don't have much to review on besides their coffee and cinnamon bagel because that is my go-to order... however, they definitely do these things  right! I have also tried their pumpkin bagel and pumpkin coffee during their seasonal offerings. Very good. \\n\\nThe ambiance isn't anything to write home about. It's not necessarily a quiet place but if you work well in more casual environments, it is very welcoming to those looking for a place to get stuff done. They also have free WiFi. \\n\\nI am giving Bruegger's 4 stars because the interior could use a touch up (booths with rips). However, that is no reason to stop me from making this a go-to for me!

We ordered white meat, agreeing to pay the $1.00 up charge, and received dark meat. No big deal right? They'll fix it. Wrong! The waitress argued with me trying to convince me that a thigh was a breast. Because lots of breasts have legs attached to them huh? After waiting ten minutes to get the correct chicken we received a dried out breast to accompany the dried out brisket that was also on the platter.

Unfortunately, the soup wasn't as flavourful as I would have hoped. It tasted weak, like it had been watered down. I only finished half a bowl of my soup.\\n\\nThe Pad Si-Ew comes with pork but you can substitute beef or chicken at no extra cost which is nice. My portion was very generous, but I felt like the flavours were off. It didn't taste bad, just not like any Pad Si-Ew that I've ever had before. Maybe different spices?  \\n\\nThere was only one waitress, which I thought was a bit strange for lunchtime.

He also said it wasn't about the money, but it was his rule and he wasn't changing it. If it's not about the money...then do it!!\\n\\nI asked him what was the difference between me ordering it at the table and boxing it up myself, as I did with my son's leftovers, as opposed to them making it and putting it in a box for me aka 'to go' ?

Even though I'm a local girl, I put myself in vacation mode took it all in like a tourist. \\n\\nMy boyfriend did the planning and we had an upgraded room which I was stoked. The executive suite was beautiful and even had a wood burning fireplace. And it was about 800sf! When do you ever get to stay in a city hotel room the size of your apt? Yes! \\n\\nService was first class all the way. We checked in and out with Lillian. She was extremely personable and fit for her position. All the hotel staff we encountered were friendly. We took advantage of the fireplace butler a couple times. You could select from a menu of wood, each wood had a description of how the fire would burn/smell. \\n\\nThe suite was framed in luxury. All the furniture was new but retained an old elegance look. The room was impeccably clean. The bathroom, while on the smaller side, was functional with stone accent everywhere. You can even call the bath butler to make your bath heavenly. The Molten Brown products in the bathroom were a generous size, take them with you! \\n\\nThe Champagne Brunch in the morning was fabulous! If you have the opportunity to go there for it as a non-guest, do it. It was shellfish galore, sushi, meats, cheeses, hot buffet, and a full dessert selection.

I'm a fan.\\") for me. This is a local fast-casual Mexican chain with currently three locations: Buckhead, Tucker, and this one in Inman Park. What's cool about this location is it's situated on the Atlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail. It opened in 2016.\\n\\nThe restaurant is hidden from street view, tucked away in the Stove Works mixed-use development across from Krog Street Market. Other Stove Works tenants include Rathbun's and Krog Bar. Free self-parking is available for Bell Street Burritos customers in the Stove Works deck, though spots are limited. Additionally, there are a handful of open-air spots reserved exclusively for Bell Street Burritos customers right outside the restaurant.\\n\\nBell Street is like a local, hipster version of Chipotle. I've been to their old location (now closed) on Howell Mill Road (https://bit.ly/2FDef9Y) and their location on Peachtree Street in Buckhead (https://bit.ly/2uvdNV1). I like Bell Street, though I can't really say I prefer it over Chipotle and Willy's. They're all good and fine to me. This location on the BeltLine is no exception.\\n\\nBell Street sells burritos, bowls, quesadillas, tacos, and other food like nachos, chili, and tamales (Friday only). They offer about a dozen different protein and vegetable fillings in both corn and flour tortillas. You can expect to spend at least about $7-9 each for most regular sized burritos/bowls, about $8-11 each for most extra-large burritos/bowls, about $6-8 each for most regular-sized quesadillas, about $8-10 each for most extra-large quesadillas, and $3-4 each for most tacos. Tacos come in two styles: green (with onion, cilantro, green salsa) and chipotle (melted cheese, grilled onions, spicy chipotle salsa). There are free toppings like cilantro and onion and there are premium toppings like potatoes and green chiles that cost anywhere from $0.25 to $1.00 per topping. Add $3.75 if you want to make your meal a combo with chips, salsa, and a drink. So you're looking at roughly $15 per person after tax and tip.\\n\\nThey have a kids menu, they serve beer, and they offer desserts like sopapillas (deep-fried sweet tortillas) and pops from King of Pops. Breakfast burritos are available Saturday, 11am-2pm.\\n\\nWe stopped in for dinner on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy. The Stove Works as a whole was busy though. There was no parking in the deck, but luckily, multiple Bell Street surface spots were open. Here's what we got:\\n\\n* Guacamole and chips (small for $3.95)\\n* Green taco (onion, cilantro, green salsa), steak, corn tortilla ($3.75)\\n* Green taco (onion, cilantro, green salsa), pulled chicken, corn tortilla ($3.50)\\n* Chipotle taco (melted cheese, grilled onion, spicy chipotle salsa), pork, corn tortilla ($4)\\n* Steak bowl ($8.50) - pinto beans, melted jack cheese, rice, salsa fresca, chipotle salsa, cilantro, jalapeno, onion, green chiles (+$1)\\n\\nIn general, the food was consistent with the food I've had at other Bell Street Burritos locations: good, but not great. This place is worth stopping by if you're on the BeltLine and want some quick and casual Mexican food.\\n\\nThe small guac serving is really small. If you want to share, I recommend going with a large ($5.95). Bell Street's chips remind me of Tostitos white corn chips, except thinner, crispier, and they're served warm. They're tasty and for me, one of the more memorable tortilla chips around town. The guac was delicious. It would've been nice if the serving size was a bit bigger though. They put pico de gallo on top of their guac to add more flavor and texture.\\n\\nThe tacos were fine. All the tacos were served in double-layer corn tortillas. They needed two layers because the inner layer wasn't strong enough to hold the ingredients and salsa. The pulled chicken taco was my least favorite, but it wasn't bad. The steak and pork tacos just tasted better. Portion sizes on the steak were lacking in both the taco and the bowl, so that was underwhelming. As for green taco vs. chipotle taco, go with a green taco if you want a tangier, \\"fresher\\" tasting taco and go with a chipotle taco if you want smokier and more savory flavor.\\n\\nLike the tacos, the steak bowl was fine. It was satisfying. It wasn't as filling as a Chipotle steak bowl, but it was filling enough. The ingredient quality was good and I liked the combination of ingredients and flavors. The bowl didn't really wow me though or have me craving more like a bowl at, say, gusto! would. Again, I wish there was more steak. The steak portion seemed too small.\\n\\nService was great. All of the staff we interacted with were polite and friendly. We dined in, took a number, and our orders were delivered to our table fast. Drinks, eating utensils, and condiments were self-serve. No need to bus your own table here; they do it for you.\\n\\nThe restaurant has two levels of interior seating and a covered patio on the lower level. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed."},{"name":"BD's Mongolian Grill","address":"3977 Worth Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"If you don't have a large appetite, you're going to pay almost as much as your garbage disposal counterparts.

The service provided is just as horrible as the food. CAN I GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR??\\n\\nAs someone who grew up around a large number of Pakistanis and Indians I understand the cuisine well. Normally I would come here and pick up some naan. Since Shalimar became Tempura Grill Austin I have been here a few times and have been highly dissatisfied. Sometimes they have forgetten a naan or two. On one occasions I only received 7 and a half naans when I ordered 8. This even happened after filing a complaint with the guy at the counter. His promises to ensure better quality service are nothing but lies. Whenever you call to place an order he says there are customers and ask us to wait. However, one who speaks either Hindi or Urdu can tell he is just chatting away with friends and also does this while others are in line waiting to either pick up or place this order. \\n\\nToday we decided to order some nihari. We ordered two orders of it and were highly displeased. The curry itself lacked basic seasoning such as salt and was extremly oily while there was hardly any meat in a dish known for containing beef. They even advertise it as Beef Nihari yet lack an esstential element of it when serving it: the beef. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend people who are being introduced to the cuisine of the indian subcontinent to NOT try this food. The food is not at the level of the other establishment of its kind in the Austin area and the service is subpar.

For a city that loves dogs more than even its bikes, you gotta admit, that's a good shtick and I'm surprised it's not more common. \\n\\nIf it weren't for that shtick, this place would be 2 stars and not 3. Everything is fine and stuff you could easily make at home. That's probably why 75% of the folks eating here are dog owners. They want brunch, but don't want to leave their pooch. Alas, that leaves out the much more brilliant but equally long of a wait at Tasty n Sons, and drags folks over to here. \\n\\nThat being said, the food isn't bad! I loved my buttermilk biscuit and homemade jam, in the way I love all buttermilk biscuits and homemade jam. My salad was very good. My cheesy grits were cheesy and gritty. The bacon gravy tasted like bacon and had the texture of gravy. The potato pancake was a big star, though. Not at all greasy as they frequently are. It was a latke at its best. \\n\\nThe menu is very easily adaptable to whatever dietary needs you have. The servers won't look twice if you want your scramble vegan, or your burger paleo.

I have gone to visit 3 times and each time has disappointed me. The food has been delicious but the disappointment each visit has left me with an overall poor experience. The first visit was a few months after opening, there was still a long lineup out the door. Arrived shortly after opening and ended up waiting for over an hour and the treats we wanted were either not available or sold out quickly. We wanted the parfait which apparently had been out of stock for awhile and the limit of 3 cakes still prevented us from trying out the O Matcha Cake.\\nSecond and third visits were by reservation because we wanted to try the souffle pancake and soba. Space was limited and so the reservation time was 3 months for when we wanted to go.\\nThe first reservation date was for the Soba Bar. We looked at the menu online and was looking forward to trying the Tonkotsu Soba. When we arrived, we didn't know where to check in and were seated in the same area as the take out orders so it was very loud. We didn't find out until as we were ordering that the Tonkotsu Soba was sold out so we ended up ordering Nishin Soba and the Unagi Dashi Chazuke. A friend also ordered the Matcha Parfait and asked to have it brought out at the same time the rest of the food came out because they didn't want dinner. Her parfait didn't come out until everyone else was almost done eating. I ended up ordering a Matcha Parfait myself after finishing my meal and it didn't take as long to come out...seems a bit odd here but maybe timing was just off, I can't say for sure.\\nWe came back the third time because I wanted High Tea and hoping that we can get a second shot at the Tonkotsu Soba. We were informed that the Soba's aren't served until after 5pm and that was the final straw. While the food I cannot repeat enough was good, the disappointments outweighed everything else. If there were posts in the store and especially on the menu indicating items were \\"Limited quantities\\" or \\"Available only after 5\\" we would be more understanding but I can only say this was overhyped and my patience has been tested time and time again that I can't really recommend this place unless you were in the area and were passing by, otherwise I would say there are other places worth checking out instead."},{"name":"Ferrara Pizza and Pasta","address":"3020 Lamberton Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Simply awful. 40 minutes to get a  medium pepperoni to go. \\nLost tickets. \\nKids behind the counter laughing. \\nHe pizza guy making the pizzas was trying but they screwed him over. \\nEvery single person who came in after me got their food and left. \\nSorry about the wait sir...\\n\\nSorry I won't be returning."},{"name":"Austin's Habibi","address":"3316 Harmon Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A short drive away from campus but so good!

I told her we just want to eat, and not sit around all night. I ordered a calzone, my friend ordered a sub. I was informed by cashier girl that the calzone will take some time to cook. I didn't know how to take that as if since the clock was ticking would it give us even less time to sit down to eat? Or was she discouraging me to not order a calzone at 8:15 at night? Whatever the reason, we felt very unwelcome. She did say that it will take longer to cook than a sub so my friend would prob get his meal first. When the meals arrived, my calzone came first. Assuming they forgot his sub since we were told it would be out first he said I ordered a sub too. Another female who brought mine out told him she only has two hands!

Solid pies sold here!"},{"name":"Hyatt Regency Orlando","address":"9801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"When you are supposed to be a NON SMOKING hotel, make it NON SMOKING.

To slowly POISON our children? Sofa bed pull out was horrible. Cakes in the b-line restaurant are better if you take them to go.
