They also have seasonal beer that change during the year although they did not have any this night.  All the beer is full flavored nothing like the big breweries swill.  If cheap swill is what you consider beer do not come here as they do not sell any other beer than their own brews.\\n\\nEveryone's food looked, smelled and tasted great as well!

I would give it zero stars if that were an option on Yelp. I can't comment on the quality of the food because we didn't stay long enough to find out. That's how poor the service was. I am not usually one to write reviews on these sites, but I am so disgusted by my experience at Massimino's that I feel compelled to share it. Let me also add that we came here because Massamino's was highly recommended to me by a friend who said that \\"the eggplant parmasean is outstanding and the atmosphere and service is good.\\" You can imagine how disappointed we were.\\n\\nSo here's our story: My date and I had a 6:00 pm reservation which we made three days ago, and when we arrived, the \\"hostess\\" (if you can call her that), hastily informed us that there would be a 30 minute wait. There were two other couples behind us who had made reservations as well and they were told the same thing. The hostess's explanation was that whoever took the reservation did not write it down and because there was a game in town, she didn't have enough seating. (Umm that is their problem, not ours)! She wasn't even apologetic. She just told us to \\"go down to the bar and get yourself a drink.\\" When I told her that neither of us planned to order alcohol, she said \\"oh then you can't go down to the bar. They really wouldn't like that. You'll have to wait up here.\\" Because the restaurant is in cramped quarters, there wasn't anywhere for us to wait, or sit down for that matter. About 10 minutes later, she led us downstairs to the bar area (presumably for a table?), but then left us standing there without seating us. When I asked one of the waitresses if she could be of assistance, she said something about needing to grab a check and then ran off.\\n\\nNeedless to say, my date and I were not impressed. I asked to speak to the manager and was told that he was not in tonight. Finally, my date told the hostess \\"There are plenty of other places that serve eggplant parmasean in the North End that will seat us.\\" And we left.

The vanilla and chocolate ice-cream were average. The thing that really threw me off was that they don't use real whipped cream. They use something that tastes akin to cool whip. I like fresh whipped cream and would have accepted a store bought version. The cream puff was hard and filled with cool whip. The eclair was not fresh but similar to a frozen wholesale foods eclair.

I liked how there was actually a thick layer creamy peanut butter between the cake and frosting as opposed to some whipped up stuff containing 15% peanuts.

While everyone has been raving about the soup, I find it a bit too rich for me... probably because I'm not a huge fan of cheese. Very flavorful with bits of bacon, I enjoyed it better when dipped with the pretzel bread. The sausage is equally a bit too much since it definitely has more of a spicy zing to it than I expected. The polenta + onion sauce at the bottom of the skillet balanced this out on my tongue.\\n\\nRegarding the entrees, I can honestly say that everything we've tried here has been good but not the best I've ever had.

While every table will eye the towering plate as it comes to your table... in the end, it's actually kind of hard to eat if you're actually trying to incorporate marshmallow, graham cracker, brownie + ice cream into each bite. Another fun dessert is the Chocolate \\"Moose\\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0YKKxJcLmisKhB8QPHZDug?select=6MQyY1WGBzafuTqxa38RYw which is mousse actually shaped into the head of a moose complete with maple leaf ears, candy eyes + a tongue sticking out.

While it looks like every other cr√®me brul√©e you've had in your lifetime, I assure you that the maple flavor in this dessert makes it unforgettable! \\n\\nIf I were rating Le Cellier purely on desserts, I would give them a solid 5 stars... but all things in consideration, a 4.5 stars rounded down! I've heard that this restaurant has more hype than Les Chefs de France, but the French have it as my #1 favorite based on personal preference of the dishes offered. \\n\\nTIPS: Again, do make a reservation as early as you can, which means months in advance!

This city could certainly use more restaurants like this one, with nice decor and a short but delicious menu.  I guess they're now open for lunch, which I have yet to try (though I've heard it's really good), but I have eaten dinner here a few times now (maybe 4-5?), so I have lots to comment on regardless.\\n\\nOne thing that's a must here is the garlic bread.  The bread has bits of roasted garlic in it, and the bread it grilled before it's brought to your table, with more garlic and parmesan on top.  I'm sure the garlic bread here is the best garlic bread in town, and I make sure to get it every time.  \\n\\nI've tried a number of things on the menu and all have been good.  The tortellini trio (I think that's what it's called) has three different sauces on top and is probably one of the best things they have to offer.  I also really enjoyed the stuffed pastas, as the cheese tastes incredibly light and fresh without being overwhelmingly \\"cheesy\\" or \\"gummy\\".  My least favorite dish was the \\"Ms. T's favorite\\", which has cherry tomatoes and basil and is okay but rather lacking overall in flavor.  I think this may have something to do with the olive oil they're using, as it's really light and not at all flavorful; one of my only complaints about this place has to do with their olive oil choice.  It makes dipping bread in olive oil and vinegar a bland experience instead of a delicious one.  Changing the olive oil could be a HUGE improvement for some of the items.  Also, it would be nice if freshly grated parmesan was offered for the entrees... right now, the pastas are served, and that's it, whereas fresh parmesan could give even more flavor to the dishes and make them pop.  But to end on a positive note, for dessert, the tiramisu is good and definitely something that two people can split.  \\n\\nThis restaurant has only been open a few months, and I'm pretty sure it'll get better as they really find their stride; I've certainly had better dishes as the time goes on.  I'd love to see some of the changes I mentioned about (better olive oil, fresh parmesan offered), but it's still a place I'd recommend, especially because of their awesome garlic bread.

The shellfish offerings are clearly the star of the place, so the fish is a bit average overall. Non-seafood entrees are certainly not to the same standard as the crab or lobster. The BBQ entrees were bland, the prime rib was overdone and dry, the salads were wilted and seemed old, and the vegetables on the line were overcooked. \\n\\nThe lobster, crab, and other shellfish entrees are where the real value is. Unfortunately later in the day it seems standards started to slip and things either tasted overly salty or a bit off when we were taking them fresh from the line.  \\n\\nIf you love shellfish then I suggest getting there before 6 PM (1800) for the early bird pricing and seating during the peak period for the best food. If you miss the dinner rush then I suggest giving this place a pass as the food won't refresh on the line often enough for the chefs to produce quality food for the $40+ price tag.

Sadly, you would be mistaken yet again.\\n\\nI won't get into the minutiae of the evening, as that has been more eloquently done by others, so I'll sum up my review as follows:\\n\\nStart with 5 stars for $1.50 slice of cheesecake, subtract 1 star for every hour it takes to get said cheesecake.

I think what really makes this place stand out from the rest of the restaurants around Fort Point though, is the atmosphere. It has a really cool, unpretentious vibe and the music is notably good. Ming Tsai apparently has great taste in music. The waitresses and bartenders also could not be nicer. It's some of the best service I've seen around Boston. I live in the neighborhood, so this place may become my second home."},{"name":"Nutty Brown Cafe","address":"12225 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I had heard good things about Nutty Brown Cafe years ago and then forgotten all about them.

He still helped me with a decision and was very attentive and sweet. He was not he problem.\\n\\nAt first I was simply disappointed in the food. I had a patty melt, you should really not be able to screw up a patty melt. The burger seemed to only be seasoned with salt, not really any flavor. The meat was DRY!!! Oh, so dry! The burger was on sourdough and not the more traditional rye. Problem is even the bread lacked taste, it was almost like a slice of white bread rather than sourdough. Someone in the kitchen needs to learn the fine art of food prep. I had some chunks of not quite cooked 'sauteed' crunchy onion that were so big I felt like I was just biting into an onion. The root end had not been cut off and I was served a chunk of onion the size of a walnut on my sandwich. I love onion but BLECHH!\\n\\nI was thinking to myself as I drove away, lesson learned. Not a bad (as in ewe gross I can't even eat that) burger; just not a very good burger. Problem is, now I feel sick to my stomach and i have a fairly strong stomach. Something wrong with the food?

Just alright.\\n\\nI ordered the signature cheese soup and filet mignon with mushroom risotto. The soup was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. The flavor was quite sharp and felt heavy. I could understand how some people like it though. The bread basket, on the other hand, we both loved. We asked for seconds of everything, but especially the pretzel bread. As for the entree, we both liked the mushroom risotto. The filet mignon was tasty but not as good as I expected it to be. I am not picky with steaks but I do have to say that even the Kona Cafe top sirloin I had the next day was much more satisfying. \\n\\nThe service was pleasant for the most part. The waitress was nice but there was one big thing that we were disappointed with. Since we came here to celebrate a birthday, we both expected that we would receive a complimentary dessert or a small glass of wine or something. Unfortunately, that did not happen, even though we had made reservations on the exact birthday. We were not even offered one of those generic Disney birthday cupcakes. All we were really given as a birthday freebie was a take-home menu that said \\"Happy Birthday\\" on top. Although we understand that restaurants are not necessarily required to do anything for birthdays, we did have a sour taste in our mouths as we were given our bill. Even omitting a minor thing like this can really dampen someone's night. \\n\\nI really wanted to love this place and have it be the dining highlight of our Disney World trip, but it really wasn't. We felt that the the whole experience was definitely not worth the price. There were some elements of our dinner that we quite liked, but we would not make returning to Le Cellier a priority. There are just too many great restaurants at Epcot and WDW to want to come back here. \\n\\nP.S. The dining atmosphere isn't spectacular.

I rate each place against its \\"peers\\" and this place has some tough competition for a high-price-point Sushi place.  Shin, Hanamizuki, Nagoya, Amura, and others do a lot better job at similar dollars.\\n\\nOutdoor tables have a nice view of downtown Baldwin Park, sometimes even of Lake Baldwin and the lighted fountain if you get a table closest to the street and corner.  Indoors is clean and modern and nice, as pictures show.\\n\\nService is dependably good, sometimes great, depending on who you get.  Courses are served leisurely and never piled over each other -- of course, I never have this problem because I refuse to order everything all at once.  I eat one thing, then order what looks good from there.  But it does matter to those of you who like to pre-select everything.\\n\\nYou get plenty of attention and they're quick to ask if you'd like another wine from their reasonably good wine list, generously poured when by the glass.\\n\\nThis all sounds so great, so why 2-Stars?   Well, frankly, the food.  And that's the main thing we theoretically dine out for -- although I have a different theory:  I think it's for entertainment, but that's a discussion for another day.\\n\\nYeah, the food.  Look, I can get GREAT sushi at Shin just 3 miles away, probably the best in Orlando, and at similar prices.   Seito's just isn't of the same quality, same creativeness, and I even doubt the freshness (not sure if that's Seito's fault, or their vendor).\\n\\nSeito has this history of going up and down, and right now it's down.  The problem years ago might have been that they were spread too thinly between at least 4-5 locations.  Then they cut back to 2 locations and improved greatly, ranking nearly as well as other Sushi places of comparable cost.  Wine list improved, etc.  But now that they've opened Osprey Tavern across the street, Seito has suffered.\\n\\nIt's more than merely a Sushi place.  You can get a steak here, or a broiled piece of white fish.  And the menu is interesting, but it's stuck in-between.  It's not a full menu like Hanamizuki, and it's not strictly sushi/sashimi like Shin Sushi.   And that's not a happy medium if you like sashimi or sushi as an appetizer then real Japanese food as an entree.  And that's what I tend to like.  But here it's limited choice in non-sushi and that's enough to tease but not to satisfy.\\n\\nThen there's the quality.  I'm officially now afraid of the tuna kobachi.  And that's a staple item for a sushi bar to make.  Heck, non-Japanese restaurants try to be trendy by having it on their teaser menus.  And somehow, it's really fishy.  Sashimi, especially when in ponzu-ish sauce, should not be fishy, especially tuna, valued for its sashimi texture, but not so much flavor.\\n\\nAs for creativity, the chefs here don't dazzle.  I like to give a sushi chef some latitude to surprise me, but with certain caveats such as: no avocado, no mayo, no gooey sauces, but plenty of different fish roe (smelt, salmon, flying-fish in all colors).  And I like shavings of different sashimi decorating the top and sides.  And at the center, nice soft-shell crab and another fish is great.  But I can't have that here.  No deep-fryer means no soft-shell crab, or many other sushi options...   This is a problem.\\n\\nThe sushi rice here seems to fall apart so much more easily than it should.  Are they using enough sushi vinegar?  This should be basic stuff for a sushi place, and every roll should be perfect in a place of this price -- and I'm not at all price sensitive when I eat, but this bothers me because I tend to use price as a guideline to the quality of a place.\\n\\nThere are a host of other culinary sins that Seito commits, too numerous to name.  It was more interesting to use this review to examine WHY there is such a problem of a place trending up and down over long-term cycles.\\n\\nAt least for now, you can cross Seito off your list.  There are so many better places to go if you want cheap, poorly-made sushi and appetizers.\\n\\nI'll update this if they improve.  I live walking distance and I'll try it again periodically.  I have hope for it -- I like to support Downtown Baldwin Park."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I was taken here for my birthday a couple weeks ago by some strong foodies and I was very impressed.

As it turned out, probably nothing more than the hype of a new restaurant opening. I mean, the food was good and reasonably priced, but I don't think it warrants the wait. (Kinda reminds me of when Beard Papa first opened in Aberdeen Centre. People waited forever for those cream puffs! And now? Barely a single person in line.) The concept of \\"designing\\" your own bowl of noodle soup is pretty cool though (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/AeAGcXBZAH4NMkYSUSMHvA?select=8bhPIjp6r4PENYdmHvaXZg).\\n\\nMommy and I got two bowls of custom noodle soup--the first with basa fillet, fish tofu, and specialty sausage in parsley & century egg fish soup (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/AeAGcXBZAH4NMkYSUSMHvA?select=y_Ztfq2zCOav0mLxYUqkIQ) and the second with fish puff, mushrooms, and pork liver in malay laksa soup (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/AeAGcXBZAH4NMkYSUSMHvA?select=8mqSOtxtfamvpajrvJ3plQ). The fish soup had a nice slight creaminess to it but was a little bland; the laksa soup was a lot more flavourful--and a little spicy! It had a splash of coconut milk and a nice lemongrass flavour. Yum! We chose thick vermicelli (like a rice flour spaghetti) for both soups and the noodles were cooked well. All the toppings were pretty good except for the overcooked liver. (Tofu puffs were included in both noodle soups.) My favourites were the specialty sausage and the fish puffs (similar to tofu puffs but chewier). The sausage was fatty and flavourful and reminded me of the ones I used to eat in HK. The fish puffs were just plain delicious. I loved their texture and they were perfect for soaking up lots of tasty laksa soup. Double yum!\\n\\nWe also got sides of marinated pork intestines (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/AeAGcXBZAH4NMkYSUSMHvA?select=oROXmiFDZUsvTkHwLILX6g) and deep-fried chicken wings (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/AeAGcXBZAH4NMkYSUSMHvA?select=3DncESV6wfG21K6iFBTZ1w). The pork intestines were absolutely fantastic! So warm, soft, and fatty, they practically melted in my mouth. They were marinated well had that distinctive poop-was-stored-here flavour that I love--what could be better? (That's not weird, right?) The chicken wings were also really good. Served piping hot, they were juicy, tender, and deliciously seasoned.\\n\\nLastly, we got an order of chicken on steamed rice (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/AeAGcXBZAH4NMkYSUSMHvA?select=w50hCFpj9DZPwHDWIR3LFw). For $6.25 this was the best deal on the menu. The portion was huge and it even included a drink. There was a lot of flavourful chicken but even though it was all dark meat it could've been more tender. Still, it's a simple and very satisfying dish.\\n\\nGiven the number of Chinese restaurants in the greater Vancouver area, I probably won't be back. It's still worth a try though, if only for the custom noodle soups and fabulous pork intestines!"},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What can I say?

I thought this was so well-handled and knew we were in for a great meal. \\n\\nOf the starters I was loving the queso dip and also the chicken fried oysters which have a major kick. I ordered the shrimp and grits for my dinner and was blown away by Lamberts' spin on this southern classic. The dish had a great tangy flavor and, surprisingly, didn't feel super heavy. The collards and mac and cheese we had on the side were both fantastic. \\n\\nThere was no room for dessert but I'm sure they would have been wonderful.

But, one thing I will give them is that they were knowledgable about the area and much more helpful than the front and concierge desk.

I told them that I could do that myself, she goes on to print out a few restaurants with \\"the most stars\\" she says. We walked out to the valets and asked them where to eat...they immediately gave us maps with directions, wrote names of hot restaurants, and circled the area on the map. That is what we expected.

This was more of a 3 star hotel. We requested a Queen bed but they only had doubles and my wife raised an eyebrow and the Mgr quickly hit the keyboard to look for a Queen. But, he had no luck, instead he moved us to a room with a view of the river and the downtown area and extra breakfast comps. Does that make up for their mistake, a little. The room was decent and clean...which was a good thing because I couldn't take another raised eyebrow look from my wife LOL!  I do believe that when the manager found out we were in the hotel industry in LV, he did everything he could to make a good impression on us. The fitness room and the pool was just ok.

For the place is located on the second floor, so the visual enticement is not readily apparent.  It's one of the few good places I know that offer both Japanese sushi items and Korean BBQ (which you grill yourself by your tableside) in an all-you-can-eat package.\\n\\nI do have to stress the Yakiniku aspect or else the dining experience wouldn't be complete if you were here only for the sushi items.\\n\\nThe place is almost always packed and large groups celebrating someone's birthday is a given at this restaurant.\\n\\nOur waiter was courteous at first and tried to explain (despite the language barrier) the menu style and portion.  But as the place filled up, the time between dishes started to build and were inconsistent in arriving.  Because you grill the meat yourself when ordering the Yakiniku portion, then you have to allow time to be able to cook the raw items and prepare to wait longer.  Given this scenario, I was surprised that our waiter was trying to kick us out after an hour and a half by calling for a last order for our table.  It was early dinner when we arrived so I guess he wanted to make sure a fast turn-around for two or more set of guests after us.  I hope this is not what happens for a large group especially in one of the semi-private rooms.  For I would certainly recommend this place and will be back perhaps at their other location just to experience a better service that isn't rushed especially when you cook the items yourself.\\n\\nThe food for the price is certainly not bad and the meat items is definitely tasty and soft.  I'm impressed.  While the ambiance is nothing to sing about, its certainly what you come to experience typical of a Japanese and Korean restaurant.\\n\\nParking is obviously street level so plan ahead or take a bus if you don't want to think about expired meters unless, of course, you're hinted at being kicked out as well for over-staying.

Another server walked by and watched me clean them up, stared at me for a second and then walked away. Then my server saw the pile of chips and asked what happened, I told him I accidentally knocked them over and he said \\"oh, good, I thought we did something.\\" Then he kind of laughed and walked away. Later he asked if we wanted more chips. I asked if refills were free and he said, \\"no, this is senor frogs, nothing's free. It would be $3.\\" So I thought that was pretty stupid.

You can get something similar but much better at Giovanni's on Chickasaw Trail and Curry Ford.  We would not consider going back because the music was cranked up to headache volume.  A table of four seated near us left before ordering for this reason.  Yes, I am an old fart, but I love music.

I had a very cool server. I can't remember his name right now but if I saw him I wouldn't know him. But my bad experience came from the kitchen and the manager. My food came out definitely not the way that we ordered. We ordered well-done burgers and we got medium rare. I asked to speak to the manager because we had already been in there over an hour waiting on our food. The manager came to the table and only suggested a re-cook. She also gave us a simple apology. I work in customer service and I feel as though that was subpar customer service at best. I was visiting for my birthday and that left a bad taste in my mouth. We had plans after dinner and weren't able to make our plans because we were waiting for our food to be recooked. The manager didn't even appreciate our business. We were a party of 5 and spent plenty of money there. The chicken came out okay. But the only thing I can remember is the poor treatment from the manager. If I'm spending with my party over $200 for a meal and that's the type of service I get, it makes me not want to ever come back to this establishment. And I guess she doesn't understand that word of mouth is powerful. We came there on a suggestion of a friend. Now if someone else were to ask me where to eat, based off of that experience, I will tell them this is place not to eat.

I went in because I was caught in nostalgia, thinking of the fish and chips eaten years ago in Jolly Ole'.\\n\\nIn the window I saw that they had a $5.00 basket. 'Fantastic' I think, six dollars is about all I have got. And I'm no stiff, I generally do not eat out if I am unable to tip respectably; but in my experience, buying fried fish is a quick, dirty exchange. It is one to be done with the haste of a drug deal.\\n\\nSure the waitress asked me if I wanted to dine in and sure- I said yes, setting myself up to endure a charade of menus and water; I come to learn that this $5.00 basket is a lunch special which has ended-even though some dude who seemed to be the owner (he was the only thing British in the place) told me yes they had a $5.00 basket. So whatever turns out there is a happy hour special of fish 'bites' and chips. The name churns my stomach but at the magic price of $5.00, I'll take it.\\n\\nOnce the order is in I am left to sit in this eerie and smelling back room booth; on a rainy afternoon with the curtains drawn shut, a choice which only amplifies the deafening levels of the cheaply thought 'British' aural fare being pumped throughout. The only thing which can make this worse is the fact that a television not five feet away from me is playing an episode of Dr. Who. How I longed for a miracle, or a sign of life that would turn down the music and turn up the sound on the time travel. But alas, not even a subtitle.\\n\\nSo the fish bites arrive; they turn out to actually be a decent size portion, whereas I would recommend if you MUST EAT HERE that you buy this and you will save some bucks instead of buying the $9.00 serving on the menu and you'll save your body the misery processing that shit because it was greasy and it was wrong and I knew that going in-but it wasn't even good. I could barely taste the fish it was so soaked in grease and oil; I imagine it needed to drain a bit more before being put in the basket. The chips were the better part of the meal but really, uninspired. I would like to know if they were homemade and I would respect them more if that was the case. But really, it just tastes and smells like they need to clean their fryer and use some better grease that does not have the plastic-tub edge to it.\\n\\nIn the end it wasn't even the poor food or the confusing pricing and menus that made it so god-awful. That place was lonely and dark and seriously needs some health inspection. And the waitress had some real long hair in a loose ponytail which is killer for me. Put that shit in a net or a tight-bun puhleeeezzz.\\n\\nI go to PCC and if there was a decent chippy around, I might end up spending a lot more money there than I would care to admit. Somebody should move into the neighborhood and serve superior fish and offer a selection of meat pies, sausage rolls, and chip baps + shit, and make a chip outta something other than a Russett Burbank for crying out loud.

And even with these you can customize. For instance my fave is a customized Rad Thai salad: no bean sprouts, add avocado and corn, take out shrimp (I don't love their shrimp quality personally but it's a salad chain not a seafood joint!!) and add falafel instead. Yum! \\n\\nTheir kale Caesar is satisfying and I used to love their spicy Sabzi but my taste has changed. I wish they had softer and larger cut beets (like at Chopt - found in NYC and D.C.). Their grain bowls are heartier too if you're looking for more filling options!\\n\\nLunch service is very very efficient and you can mobile order too. I'm a fan of their various lemonades and iced teas! Free wifi is nice. \\n\\nService during off peak hours can use work truthfully. It can move pretty slowly but if you've got time the salads are worth it. Salad prices range from $9-15 depending on what you get. \\n\\nStreet parking is limited on Red Sox game days but the place is T accessible from the D line (or Kenmore for a longer walk) or by bus!

A lot of the sushi places are cutting their fish thinner. They have a standard selection of raw fish, yellowtail, tuna, salmon, escolar, albacore, scallops, uni, sweet shrimp are all fresh. Although the scallops and sweet shrimp are frozen and defrosted as I placed the order (not surprising for most sushi places in Austin). The toro is average at best, not the super fresh buttery/fatty stuff I'm used to. They have Spanish Mackerel sometimes where they serve the nigiri and then deep fry the bones of the fish - this was excellent. They have this special on rare occasion, so ask for it at the sushi bar and get it if they have it available.\\n\\nThey have a huge assortment of rolls that range from the standard rainbow rolls to more inventive Yanagi Specials. I usually try one of these rolls just to put a twist on things. But I'm usually purely a sushi consumer. They do offer you a complimentary seaweed salad and miso soup when you choose to sit at the sushi bar, also a nice bear carved out of the orange rind when they send you off as you ask for the bill.\\n\\nAll in all, Yanagi is a great alternative to going all the way downtown for sushi esp. if you live southwest of town. Look for the coupon in The Impact Newspaper that us Southwest Austinites get in the mail periodically.\\n\\nHope this helps."},{"name":"Huong Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"1270 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"There are few things I like better than Pho.  It so happens that one of those few things is 80s music videos, and Huong conveniently has both.\\n\\nThe pho here was excellent.  Slightly too salty to be perfect, but I loved the rich broth, chewy noodles, and ample quantities of rare steak, finely sliced tripe, beansprouts, and herbs.  The broth was so good that (a) I didn't use any chili or hoisin sauce, and (b) I drank every last drop of it.  Both occur only rarely.\\n\\nAs for the music videos, I enjoyed reconnecting with Blondie, Kim Carnes, The Police, Heart, and Mike Oldfield.

We usually stop in for breakfast - I love the breakfast sandwiches and their variations, and she enjoys their popover sandwich. The orange juice is quite literally (and I mean that correctly) the best orange juice I've ever had. I've also been there for lunch, and my favorite is the BBQ seitan.\\n\\nThe food is always fresh, hot, delicious, vegetarian, and (important for us) kosher. I highly recommend trying Clover in general. But in this review, I also want to note how excellent the Brookline Village location is. The staff who manage and work at this location are always very helpful and friendly. They don't just want to make sure they get your order right; they want to make sure you enjoy the experience.\\n\\nThe one quibble I would have with this location (which does not do anything to affect the rating I give) is that they are unable to provide chairs for patrons due to town regulations. If somehow once could eat in the location (as we do) without standing at the side table, that would be great. But that's a minor issue, given the quality of the food and the service.

It's become a fancy Brazilian Bistro.  Botekim is the type of restaurant you'd expect to find in the city, but it's not totally out of place because this area in Marietta is filled with several Brazilian restaurants and businesses.  Brazilian Bakery and Sabor Do Brazil are some examples.  However, unlike its casual neighbors around the corner, Botekim is a nice sit-down restaurant.  You can book reservations on OpenTable.\\n\\nThe outside of the restaurant is unassuming.  Inside, the restaurant has been totally gutted and renovated.  Unlike before, the space now feels bright and open.  The floor is spacious and filled with many small tables with wine glasses and white tablecloths.  There's a bar in the back with shiny TVs and outside, there's bistro-style seating inside the covered patio.  Overall, the atmosphere is very refreshing.\\n\\nBotekim's menu is simple, but virtually all of the options sound appealing.  You can order an assortment of meats and cheeses, Brazilian appetizers like yuca fritters and pork sausages, salads, sandwiches, entrees like grilled pork loin and picanha (top sirloin), sides, and desserts.\\n\\nAt lunchtime, sandwich prices range from $8 to $11 and entrees range from $9 to $16.  There are a few good lunch specials.  For example, you can get a soup and sandwich for $9 and a salad and sandwich for $11.  The soups, salads, and sandwiches in these deals are all full size.  You are basically getting a free soup or salad with your sandwich out of these deals.\\n\\nI've tried the \\"X-Picanha\\" sandwich, agriao salad, and empadao de frango.  Each of these tasted great.\\n\\nThe picanha sandwich comes on a Brazilian roll with rump cap (top sirloin), vinaigrette, and bleu cheese.  There are also freshly chopped tomatoes and onions.  The steak is cut into slices and is cooked-to-order.  I recommend medium-rare.  The meat is tender and juicy, and a little fatty as well.  The sandwich is about the same size as a regular burger.\\n\\nThe agriago salad is Brazilian watercress salad.  Along with watercress, it comes with Bibb lettuce, tomatoes, house vinaigrette, and spicy roasted pecans.  The salad is fresh and crisp.  Very good.\\n\\nThe empadao de frango is like Brazilian chicken pot pie.  One serving equals one slice.  Inside, the pie contains chopped pieces of chicken breast and hearts of palm.  On top of the pie is frisee (curly endive) salad.  Like the agriago salad, the frisee is fresh.  The empadao de frango itself is savory and delicious.\\n\\nDrink-wise, I've tried Botekim's housemade pineapple and mint soda (unlimited refills) and Guarana (Brazilian ginger ale).  The pineapple and mint soda is expectedly minty and the Guarana is served out of a can into a glass with ice and a small slice of grapefruit.  The Guarana is sweet.\\n\\nService is very good.  Chef Alex DeGrossi (Sal Grosso, Market, Bistro Niko) takes time out of the kitchen to check on his customers.  DeGrossi worked with Ian Winslade (Prime, Bluepointe, Spice Market, Buckhead Bottle Bar) to open Botekim in Marietta.\\n\\nBotekim opened Summer 2011.  To get the word out, the restaurant seems to have popped up on just about every online deal site out there.  Not only that, but while you're in the restaurant, the server may give you a special offer if you \\"Like\\" Botekim on Facebook on your smartphone.  My special offer turned out to be a $5 discount good towards my next visit.  That's a good thing because I will be coming back."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"zaftig  /z√§ftig/ Adjective (of a woman) Having a full, rounded figure; plump.\\n\\nAnd boy is that how we all felt afterward!

We went there yesterday and had this new cook, cooked our food for 50 mins and I was watching her the entire time. She was real slow and cooked everything in the wrong order. By the time everything was done my food was stone cold. \\n2. The server flipped something off with her own fingers in my girlfriend's food in front of everyone. Which pissed me off even more. It just made everything disgusting. Please learn how to be a server. If you want great tips (I usually tip 40-50%) then be more thoughtful and caring. Don't stand at your server station and chat or talk on your phone.\\n3. Every time we come here and we get habachi, my girlfriend gets extremely sick. Yes it's not the white sauce, it's how you guys prepared your food!! I've been in this industry long enough knowing that the ways you guys prepare our salad and food is not in standard with the health department. Please use gloves and don't cross contaminate our food. \\n------------\\nHowever, sushi was great!! The sushi chief is amazing and fast! After I had trouble with my food, the Asian server came over and fixed everything by getting me sushi. \\nas a conclusion, go there and expect your food to be slow and service to be bad.

This time around my friends and I came in ln a scout mob deal and we tried a variety of sushi dishes. \\n\\n1/2 deduction for food and the other 1/2 off  for the service, our waitress although very nice sometimes completely ignored us, she'd come and assist the group sitting next to us and walk off even while we we tried to get her attention at one point another diner who saw all our failed attempts finally reached out tapped her back and grabbed her arm to get her attention and send her our way. Thats not acceptable but we were nice nonetheless. \\nWe had: \\n\\nMango sushi it was better the second time around, its a flash fried rather large sushi on a big plate which was layered with a mango slaw and sauce on one side and a sweet chili sauce on the other. The dish was aesthetically pleasing and very flavorful, I did find it to be a little too sweet for my liking but others found it fine. \\n\\nThe mixed fish ceviche this time around was not as delicious as I remember it to be.  The sauce was very fresh and bright and the flavors were layered so well that each individual taste of the ingredients were highlighted and tasted separately and played well together as well.  The fish  were sashimi pieces and and some were cut too thick and did not soak in the citrus juices long enough leaving the taste to be fishy but still edible. It could have been the night but I experienced the same thing last time I ordered this too. \\n\\nThe super crunch sushi was an unexpected delicious surprise and I will definitely order once again if I come back here. It has a crunchy yet soft filling that made the dish.   \\n\\nThe red square was not good and very pedestrian as far as complexity of flavors goes. It was too sweet, too fried, and not very pleasing, kind of tasted like Chinese food.  Over all would not suggest it. \\n\\nTuesday special smoked salmon is not like the smoked salmon you'd put on a bagel or served in Seattle.

One would think that as Huuuuge as The Oasis is, they would expand on their menu. It just seems very limited in my opinion.

My visits to Zaftig's became monthly, bi-monthly, and finally I went over 3 months without dining at Zaftig's until this past Saturday when I decided I missed their delicious bagels and potato pancakes. Much to my dismay I discovered that Zaftig's now has the worst host staff I've ever experienced at a Boston restaurant - seating your buddies on a 45 minutes wait is NOT OKAY. Seating people who left and came back after you called their name is NOT OKAY. Maybe one table of two, but two tables of five is unacceptable. When I politely ask you about my place on the list (just a part y of three with my grandparents) and notice you've seated four parties that arrived after me that include two parties of three, but don't say anything, you should be appreciative and not roll your eyes at me then talk loudly to your fellow hostess about people being impatient. Heads up: you gave me a 30-45 minute quote and I came to you at 47 minutes. If I were a restaurant owner I'd fire you on the spot - and that's saying something from someone who hosted/served for four years. After finally being seated the waitress was much better than most there, but the food was sub-par - chewy eggs and burnt bagels. Needless to say Zaftig's, you've lost a regular's patronage and it's really sad."},{"name":"Vinotopia Restaurant & Winebar at Cinetopia Mill Plain","address":"11700 SE 7th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"this place sucked. it took forever just to get water. i'm very unhappy my pound cake was bad. please improve. plus we waited forever just to get our food and the guy who waited us was really slow so the manager had to come and give us an apology for the wait. i'm mad."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Whatever may have been, I just wasn't feeling HCT.\\n\\nIt really pains me to just say A-OK because I've been wanting to try Hot Chicken Takeover for YEARS. Every time I've come they're either closed or out of chicken. I finally was able to come at an open time when they had an ample amount of chicken, only to be greeted with a line out the wazhoo. I noticed their order ahead line, which I was pretty pumped about. One because I'm oblivious af and really don't notice anything, but two because I could go sit with my family and wait the 15 minutes for it to be ready instead of standing in line with the rest of Columbus.\\n\\nOne thing that always saddened me about Hot Chicken Takeover is that they don't offer potato salad, but I got over it quickly and ordered a hot chicken sandwich with a double side of mac. I waited patiently while my family and friends devoured other delicacies that could instantly be given to them by other market vendors. I thought in my head that everything was going to be okay because I was getting the thing that I so desperately wanted for years. \\n\\nWhen my order was ready, I walked back to HCT's corner restaurant. The cashier working was very friendly and gave me my order. He then directed me over to the ranch station so I could pick up the world's best condiment and some utensils. Hot Chicken Takeover has paper towels instead of napkins, which I'm not sure if it's because of the aesthetic or the waste, but I didn't find it endearing. This chicken is hot and leaves a trail, so if anyone needs extra they're getting their grimy hands all over the communal paper towel roll. I was lucky not to have that experience, but I could imagine my disdain if it did happen to me. \\n\\nI sat back with my friend and family and very excitedly opened the box. It was very heavy and I mentally prepared myself to have leftovers for after the bars. The first thing we all noticed was the bread. Why is there so much bread? They put two on top and two on bottom. I assume it was to soak up the excess sauce, but a) there wasn't as much sauce to soak up as I anticipated and b) what was I supposed to do with this bread? I'm not eating 4 slices of bread with my sandwich! The chicken breast on the sandwich itself was ginormous and I appreciate the ability to ask for extra pickles. Pickles + Nashville-style hot chicken = life. I found the sandwich itself to be really difficult to eat because the bread to chicken was not a fit. You couldn't pick it all up, but cutting into it meant that the bread would be an idiotic add on to your bites. I ended up ditching the bread and attempting to enjoy the slaw, pickles, and chicken with my homegirl ranch. The breading kept falling off so I ended up dipping non-breaded chicken and pickles into the ranch. The hot is probably very hot, but I wouldn't know because I never actually ate an unadulterated piece of the spicy coating. \\n\\nI thought maybe my saving grace would be the Mac and cheese. Do you know what it's like to be disappointed by Mac and cheese? WHO GETS DISAPPOINTED BY MAC AND CHEESE? Sure yeah, it was cheesy. It was very cheesy. But that's all it was. There was no depth of flavor. There was no creaminess. It essentially tasted like someone poured macaroni and store bought cheddar cheese into the baking dish and called it a day.\\n\\nBetween the poorly executed sandwich and the one-dimensional Mac and cheese, I felt like I'd been let down. This just was not what I was expecting. I'm still giving 3 stars. The staff was very friendly, and I don't want to be banned from Columbus. However, I will not be back."},{"name":"Nutty Brown Cafe","address":"12225 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Nutty Brown is a great venue. \\n\\nWe ate here about 100 times when my folks were building their  house in DrippingSprings.

If you don't ask when you are seated then you will get the cheap tea. Other than the condiments already on the table, soy sauce, red chili paste and hot mustard, you can also ask for tobasco sauce. I prefer the red chili paste though.  \\n\\nHere is what I normally eat and recommend. \\n\\nScary Chicken Feet- Lol. I added the \\"scary\\" part because since I was little, I was told that young children should not eat chicken feet otherwise our hands would shake and my father would do a very impressive tremble to ward my siblings and I away from the plate of chicken feet. When I grew older, my father confessed that it was something that adults said to scare the children and so that they can have the chicken feet all to themselves. Lol. China Pearl makes this dish pretty well. If done perfectly, the skin should slide off of the bones, it should be soft and very flavorful. It should be covered in a brown sauce. Don't go for the pale white stuff because that is NOT what I am talking about. \\n\\nShrimp dumplings (ha cao) and lobster dumplings (no more lobster dumplings on menu): I know some review writers complain that some of the food is very bland, well, some are supposed to be. And that's why there is a dipping sauce. The lobster dumpling is pretty flavorful by itself but you can add a little extra saltiness by dipping them in soy sauce. I love to mix in my soy sauce a little of the chili paste. You know, the red sauce next t o the yellow one.\\n\\nShu mai- like a pork and shrimp dumpling, goes into the chili paste. I like spicy, you can probably guess that right?  This is a must in all dim sum meal. It's just the way I do things. \\n\\nHmm. Not sure what to call this one. It's a shrimp rice roll. Comes in three rolls with shrimp wrapped inside. I usually ask for extra sauce. This shrimp version of this dish is better than the beef one. The bread roll version with the scallions and cilantros is also very good. I'd eat that too.  \\n\\nTripe with ginger and scallion- this one is really good alone for the first few bites so you know what it is supposed to taste like then I would dip it in the red chili paste. I just love the heat from the ginger in this dish. \\n\\nChili and salted shrimp- with heads attached! Did you know that shrimps with their heads taste sweeter than ones without their heads attached? You get this from the food bar. Skip the calamari. \\n\\nSnails in black bean or oyster sauce and clams in oyster sauce also from food bar. Go, get up and check it out. Bring your slip. You suck the snail out. Forget the toothpick. You will be there forever.   \\n\\nPork or beef intestine dish, like a stew. You get this from the food bar. When you see it you will know what I am talking about. Do not confuse with the condensed pig blood stew which is also good too.  \\n\\nOther dishes that are pretty good include the rice congee. I love the chicken one, but I also love the egg one too. Egg one is a bit unique. You might find it taste a bit rotten. Lol, because it is sort of.  Sticky rice dishes, the rice plate with the clear up side down glass bowl on top of the brown sticky friend rice. Fried tofu with shrimp paste is also very yummy comes with the lady with the cart with tofu cooking in this brown liquid sauce. Crispy fried taro something dish (lol) in the fried food cart and also good from there is the shrimp and leek fried dumpling.   \\n\\nHot tofu in sweet ginger syrup is the best desert to end the meal with.

It was not a good experience! Honestly, it was awful! The waitress was sarcastic to my father in law a few times. The food was over priced and was not good. I ordered my steak well done. It came out very link. It was cooked med. But on the ends it was burnt. I sent it back because I hate any kind of link in it and it was a $26 steak. It took them at least thirty mins for it back out. In the mean time my family all 10 of them were done eating. It came back out...it was the same steak I sent in and it was literally burnt! Burnt so bad you could smell it. I was shocked. I called the waitress over explained to her I didn't want it and I needed it removed from the check. She said OK and offered me a free steak to take home with me and the manager would make sure it was good. I was against it because it was clear the cook wasn't bright or just being rude. Either way my husband said yes. After another 30 min wait she brings it out on a plate. I asked for it to go because our family was done. There were 5 children...small9 children. She comes out and charges us with the steal that they offered free for their mistake. She talks to the manager again and he says he will take twenty percent of the steak. I asked to speak to the manager and he wouldn't come talk to us. Unreal!! I sent that steak back and left. I will NOT EVER go there again and neither will the other ten family members. The was crazy!

When I was a kid, it had all of the popular New England fare: New England boiled dinner, meatloaf and \\"badaydahs,\\" hamburg club sandwiches, pie. The mailman, local police and my 8th-grade math teacher, Mr. Peabody, ate there. There was a mini jukebox on the table of each booth, and a quarter got you 3 songs.There was even a waitress named Rosie, who wore an actual waitress dress and apron. They really did, back in the day.\\n\\nNow the juke boxes and Rosie are gone, sadly, but the diner is owned by George and Zoe, a nice Greek-American couple from Belmont. George usually is in the kitchen, and Zoe greets customers and works the counter, orders supplies, and generally keeps the place humming. Georgia and Jane are the regular waitstaff. All are nice people.\\n\\nCustomers are still local workers, though my 8th-grade math teacher has long since passed on. And now, with more than 10,000 students at Salem State University (2,000 living on-campus) across the street, they get plenty of college kids, SSU faculty and staff. The place bustles during regular breakfast and lunch hours, and on weekends for breakfast-brunch.\\n\\nThe food is what you'd hope for, for diner fare. It's American with a touch of Greek -- come on the right day and you can get one of the gazillion  \\"special entres\\" listed on the menu, some of which are traditional Greek fare -- but usually we're ordering pancakes, eggs, French toast, or a whopping platter of bagels with cream cheese, lox and big slices of tomato and onion.\\n\\nThe coffee is good and the cup is bottomless; what's more, they have a delicious crab salad sammich (on a grilled hotdog bun) with minimal mayo and no additives (not even celery) so that you can actually TASTE the crabby goodness.\\n\\nThe only real letdown, for me, is the lack of good diner desserts. Pie should be a mainstay of diners, but the current Salem Diner only offers apple pie, and it looks and tastes like it came from Costco. Not that there's anything wrong with that, as it is full of good apples, it's just that it tastes Costco-esque to me. A little bit cardboardy for the crust.\\nIf they could do the pie thing the way the Agawam Diner in Rowley does, they'd be golden! Banana cream, chocolate cream, coconut cream, blueberry, strawberry rhubarb, even cherry. Sigh.\\n\\nThe check arrives with some sweets. Sometimes mints, other times Milky Way and Hershey chocolates. The place is clean, tidy, and has the charming 50s-60s look we'd expect from an American mainstay like the Salem Diner.\\n\\nOh, and the Johnny Pesky Corner takes up the rear of the diner car, homage to the beloved former Red Sox player who used to frequent the diner for decades, and who \\"adopted\\" George and Zoe when they became owners. Johnny is 92 and in assisted living now, alas, but the memorabilia and autographed photos are still there.

On my last visit a few weeks ago, I never got that far.  We arrived around 5:30 pm and waited about 20 minutes in line just to get on the waiting list, after struggling to even to find a parking spot caused by construction issues.  After being told it would be a 30 minute wait and being directed to an inadequate bar with only 2 overwhelmed bartenders, the wait stretched to about an hour.  So after missing the sunset and the temperature dropping into the 40's, we were shown to a table on a newly opened lower deck where there was only one set of customers.  AND they were leaving because it was too cold.  When I asked where the heaters were, the seater told me those were on the upper levels.  I told her this was unacceptable and we would just take a seat inside.  She told me I would have to go back to the front desk and get back on the waiting list.  We picked up and left at that point, went down RR 620 to the Hill Country Pasta House and had a great experience.  I went to the Oasis website and entered a complaint the next day about the experience, adding that as a former restaurant manager, I felt management should be aware of what happened.

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I want to spend a little time on their standard whole chicken entree & their version of ceviche!\\n\\nThe chicken is perfection!  The owner, who is a wonderful and very kind/generous woman, informed us that the chicken is seasoned for two days and cooked over an open flame in a brick oven visible to diners.  The skin is just crunchy enough and delectable while both white and dark meat are tender and full of fall of the bone deliciousness.  I can not describe how tasty this chicken is and all the flavors that burst into your mouth with each bite.....you absolutely need to try it for yourself!  A yellow (mayonnaise based), red (like Asian hot sauce), and a green (like salsa verde) sauces are provided for the chicken...the red sauce is the best IMHO.  Their standard whole, half, or quarter chicken plates come with a simple dinner salad served with Italian dressing and out of this world fries that are fresh, not greasy and a perfect compliment to the chicken.\\n\\nMy wife loves the ceviche as do I, very different than Mexican or Salvadorean ceviche with a heavy emphasis on the cilantro flavored greens, key lime or bitter orange and a bed of sweet potato.  Extremely tasty and not too heavy.  You may be enticed to sample another excellent appetizer, the Peruvian version of plantain bananas which are not as oily as their Jamaican or Salvadorean counterparts but equally yummy especially when dipped in the sweet sauce provided.\\n\\nThis is a true Portland Metro area gem, reasonably priced, authentic and with superb service....you feel that the owner & her staff really want you to enjoy the entire experience of dining each and every visit.

After a fire a few years ago, the owners rebuilt something scary in its place.  \\n\\nThe old Oasis was a fun, oddball place a good ways from town - it was a destination, with great views and a tradition where everyone clapped at sunset.  I was a teenager the first time I went, and back then when there was almost nothing between Austin and this place.  The lake was high, roads out here were rural and it was just a ramshackle, fun spot to go to.  \\n\\nSo, time passes, I went off to college, got married, and started bringing my own family here - by this point (late 90s) it had swankified a little bit, but the food quality was suffering.  It was a spot people went to specifically for the view..  They didn't put a lot of effort into the food because there was still going to be a market for the Oasis even if it it was average, and that's just... lazy.   A few more years pass, and though you don't go expecting a great dining experience, it's still a fun place to bring out-of-town friends... plus there was an art gallery/antique shop housed in a Victorian house next door, and a new music venue, though I was never there when a band was playing.  I'm not even sure the parking lot was completely paved.\\n\\nI went last week for the first time in probably 8 years, and didn't recognize it.  The hostess explained it was a totally new building, placed on the site of the original which burned down some years ago.  I had completely forgotten.  The decks are the same, so that's neat, but it's not just a restaurant anymore.  It's a sprawling complex with various shops, constructed like a little Disney faux village, but with an odd western-themed interpretation.  It's what an overpriced architect who had never actually been here would imagine Austin was like.  The whole situation is so, so weird and even a little creepy... and the statues all over the front entranceway give me the heebie jeebies. \\n\\nThe food is still mediocre at best, the lake is tragically low, and now, rather than beautiful Texas countryside, you get to look at bloated mini-mansions crowding the hills before you go pick up your SUV in the parking structure.

Reading in advance- I knew to anticipate an hour or more wait.  Essentially there are two Dinner seatings- one before sunset and one after sunset.  The people who come before sunset get in over an hour before sunset, the people who get seated after sunset may come in before sunset but will linger with a drink around the property while sunset happens and then sit for dinner after the sun has set and the first crowd has left.  Just plan to have a two part experience if you don't get in the first seating.  \\n\\nThe fajitas were super fast out of the kitchen- within 8min, and about 10min faster than an order of Queso and Guac- which is highly unusual and something the kitchen can try to figure out how to manage better.  The server warned us that the fajitas would be very fast- and offered to put the Queso in first- so he already let us know the order might be off.  We had combo fajitas and the chicken was well seasoned and the sides were fresh with warm flour tortillas.  The beef was a bit chewy and tough.  The white chips were the freshest and for some reason the blue chips served did not seem fresh- the Queso and Guacamole were good other than the less than fresh chips.

I've tried many Chinese foods in Boston, but they are all terrible compared to the China Pearl Restaurant. I find this restaurant in 9 Tyler St Boston last weekend, I highly recommend this delicious economical restaurant, I think so for three reasons.\\nFirstly, China Pearl restaurant is located in 9 Tyler St Boston, it is near by Chinatown so it is very convenience location to MAIA's students. We have school bus can drive us to Chinatown every weekend, when we arrived at Chinatown, we walked to the restaurant just spend about 5 minutes. Secondly, I think the food of China Pearl Restaurant is really delicious and various. For example, Dim Sum is a characteristic food of Guangdong. I thought i haven't any chance can eat foods of Guangdong in Boston before I find China Pearl Restaurant. And this restaurant make really delicious various Dim Sum, it is enough to compare with good taste Dim Sum in China, so there have many Chinese customers every weekend, it also attract many American customers. Thirdly, I think consumption of this restaurant is really economical. i and my friend eat a lots of delicious food here, in the end, we just cost ÔøΩ?0 for these yummy foods,it is really economical.\\nOverall, all aspects of China Pearl Restaurant is almost excellent. The only feature I don't like of this restaurant is egg tart taste too sweet. However, I highly recommend this delicious economical restaurant again.

The one served here was more like a traditional American side salad with a little Feta cheese thrown on for good measure.  My experience at most American Greek restaurants is that the food is pretty average but well priced.  I'd have to say this holds true for The Greek Corner.

It is a must try whether you live here or are from out of town and it's ok for kids.  They even have a game area with pinball machines, etc...the only reason I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 is due to the attitude I got from an employee, the same employee, twice and when I brought a group of 10 people they were not organized or seemed to even really care that there was a group of us about to spend upwards of $200.

For those who might be unfamiliar with Portland Dining Month, let me explain: during one whole month (March this year), restaurants in the area can opt to participate and charge a flat $29 for 3 courses. This encourages all in the area to try out spendier places, to sample a restaurant's offerings, and to become acquainted with a new place or chef without completely emptying their pockets. In our case, it allowed a couple of cash-strapped friends to come eat with us!\\nMother's has a beautiful corner location which is easy to get to in the heart of Portland, with parking across the street. I paid $3 and could have left my car there until 7am (woot)!\\nWe had a reservation and were 10 min late-my fault-and when we got there had to wait 10 min for our table. No problem, except I wished afterwards we weren't kept waiting in the way of the door but were encouraged to grab a drink at the bar which was immediately behind us. (Hey, Mother's, you could have sold us another round)!\\nAnyway, they were still fussing with the table when we got to it and when I began to sit down, I was asked to wait until the staff had time to finish! (hey, Mother's, that's a problem with the hostess seating us, not with the GUEST). So we all stood there near other diners' elbows for another 2 min while two staff members finished setting the table. I know this sounds like a bad review, but the waiter was wonderful--funny, smart, witty, knowledgeable, entertaining, and fast--except when one of my table mates sent back her salmon for the 2nd time--then he disappeared! The salmon appeared to be a carelessly put together, underpresented, afterthought. None of us could figure out why OUR dishes looked and tasted so so good (especially my red snapper--oh my!) while her entree' came first overcooked, then raw inside-- TWICE--and was placed in a simple china Bento-type dish with broccoli in two corners . No bed of lettuce, no garnish,  simply a scoop of white rice next to the salmon. The rest of us were so glad we hadn't ordered THAT! Put a LITTLE care into each dish, Mother's, I can't cook very well and I could have pulled a piece of salmon out of a box, slapped it on a plate with broccoli and some 1.99 take out rice, heated it all up and done better in the microwave than you did with that dish. Notwithstanding, the manager finally checked on us after 15 minutes.  We were all done eating but our sad, salmon-ordering friend (she was still waiting for our waitperson to reappear at that point, to let him know the salmon she  had asked to be popped under a broiler for a few minutes was still raw; there had been no change. When asked, the manager made it right, giving our companion her choice of entrees and not charging her a thing, which is exactly how to handle the situation, IMO. \\n We happily ate our desserts while she had her meal and then she was happily rewarded afterwards with the best dessert of the bunch--a pear pomegranate sorbet to DIE for! One scoop pomegranate, one scoop pear, and one mixed scoop in a large martini glass--perfection !! Even our fruit detesting friend loved this dessert. I will go back just for the red snapper and the sorbet and the wonderful creme brulee' I had there that night. There were so many things that Mother's got RIGHT, I am giving them 4 stars when that evening was more like a 3...if you don't count all the wonderful food that came to our cozy and charming window table!

I am a huge fan of tea, as is my best friend, so we ended up trying three types. We drank the St. Regis ceylon blend, the Mad Hatter's blend, and the vanilla rooibos blend. The St. Regis is a very neutral type tea, perfect to start off with. The Mad Hatters is very fruity, perfect to pair with the desserts. The vanilla rooibos was a very subtle sweet, perfect to end with.

If you are able to put up with the wait, the Special Crab Soup with vermicelli and Special Fish Cake Vermicelli pho noodles will be well worth your time.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is tight. Tight seating which means sometimes you will learn to share. However, I like that they are clean and brightly lit.\\n\\n\\nSpecial Crab Soup with Vermicelli (Bun Rieu) #23: A nice flavorful broth of crab and fish soup base. The soup itself is not spicy however the orange tomato sea suggests. Crab paste was nice with every slurp of the vermicelli noodles. Comes with some shrimp and ham. Add some bean sprouts, perilla leaves and lime.\\n\\n\\nSpecial Fish Cake Vermicelli Soup (Bun Cha Ca Dac Biet) #24: The dill was fragrant and different from what you normally get.

Don't be fooled. Let's start off by the first RED flag, it's no longer called MJ donuts, it's now called el rinc√≥n criollo, and let me tell you there's nothing criollo about this place. \\n\\nIn the Latin culture criollo means homemade deliciousness, the first thing that comes to mind is the flavors from back home. The flavors that mom, pops and Abuela imbedded in our lives from day one. \\n\\nWe were a party of 5, we sat and were greeted by a nice lady whom brought us the menus and quickly started to take our order. We started by ordering our drinks, I asked for 5 ice waters for the table, but was told they only have bottled. We ordered 3 coffees, which were good. We also wanted fresh juices, like orange juice or passion... you know, the ones you typically find in Latin cafes, but that was a bust because they only had Minute Maid. \\n\\nWhatever... we got over it and moved on to our food. We each ordered a breakfast platter. The eggs here look like they are cooked on a dirty flat top or on a regular saut√© pan. Please invest in a NON stick pan so your eggs come out yellow and fluffy not brown. The bacon was not fresh at all, it had a yellow/greenish tint to them which freaked me out. The pernil is also not fresh, as a Latino I've had 2-3 day old pernil at Home and TRUST me I know what that taste like. \\n\\nWe ordered a second round of coffee, but \\"the machine broke\\" how ironic. The lady said it happens all the time, so we suggested that they return the machine if they still had the box. \\n\\nHere comes the final drop that filled the glass, we found a disgusting piece of hair in our food. The hair looked like it came from \\"you know where\\" and ironically the cook was balled and had no facial hair.\\n\\nWe all instantly dropped our food and decided that we could no longer finish our meals. We got up and asked for our bill, we barely touched our food and we're being forced to pay for the disastrous meals. \\nNo customer service!\\n\\nThe lady told us it was out of her hands and she couldn't comp the meals. She then suggested that she could call her Manager or the owner, whom were not present to see what could be done. Why isn't a Manger present? Who knows, So... she got on the phone and literally started calling someone, after a few try's that \\"someone\\" Finally answered. \\n\\nThe lady passed us the phone and we began pleading our case to \\"the owner/Manger\\" they were understanding and were able to comp the meal. We didn't walk out, we ran out. \\n\\nThis place needs help, the fact that they changed the name and haven't even opened up a new yelp account tells it all. Yelp holds business owners accountable and will not allow you to just open a new account due to a failing business. \\n\\nStay far away from this place, it was a horrible experience overall."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm no vegetarian and am usually pretty picky with all things vegetable (hint: i don't enjoy eating veggies).

This was certainly NOT the case. If it had, we would have taken our $200 + that we spent on the meal elsewhere. To make matters worse, when we explained that we had not been given the heads up about this, he unapologetically told us that he believed the hostess over us.

Lo-and-behold a coffee place that also serves authentic Mexican, and not too far away from our humble little home.  10 minutes later I then realize \\"oh no, they close at 8:30pm\\", and now it's 8:10!  We hop into our little people-mover, and we make it just in the nick of time...but they are closing.  We did our best sad puppy dog eyes and the guy at the counter could not say no.  \\n\\n20 minutes later we were enjoying tacos, a burrito, a heck of delicious margarita, and a cafe con leche.

Before we get to the food lets start off with the decor of this massive restaurant.To start off, the restaurant from the outside looks like a huge bronzed chocolate factory and when you get inside you feel like you are entering the inside of a chocolate factory themed galore. All the staffs are dressed in their costumes all walking about waiting tables, taking down reservations, stocking chocolates  etc. They have a whole floor dedicated to just selling all kinds of sweets from flavored cotton candy to candy liquor to just plain chocolate bars. You are out of the park ,but this place gives you a full separate experience for you to enjoy. Out of 2 days we visited  Orlando, we dined here twice because we had such a good experience the first time around. We went here for dinner and both times we waited for an hour, but it was well worth it because the food and the service made up for it. On our first round, recommended by our friendly waiter, we ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer, hamburger, and chicken mushroom risotto. Except for the hamburger which we were not a huge fan of, we were very pleasantly surprised of how tasty the brussel sprouts were. We never liked them before ,but after giving them a try out here, we changed our perspective on them. As for the risotto, it was the best risotto we have ever had. Besides its' massive portion size, I was able to finish most of it because it wasn't heavy. I was informed the chefs dont use any creams or butter ,but instead use chicken stock as their base. I'm not sure how they were able to make it so creamy and flavorful ,but it impressed both of us. The 2nd time we were seated around 10pm. Knowing it was late and the portions were big here we decided to just get the lobster crab penne, red velvet milk shake, and a drink (Peach Smash). The pasta dish nailed it again! The dish was full of flavor not heavy and full of lobster and real crab meat chucks!! As for the dessert it was too big. We still couldn't finish it even though we only ordered one entree to share. Also, because it was considerably more busy than the last time around,I think the milkshake melted. It came out more like a smoothie than a milkshake and it way too sweet for us. However, I did enjoy the red velvet cupcake that it came with the milkshake. As for the Peach Smash the quality was comparable to Dead Rabbit's cocktails (#1 bar in the world).

Well, no big deal, except we just wanted some food, and on I-Drive, you're guaranteed to spend at least another $15 on dinner (for a total of $30 without any tip for your server).  So, instead, we decided to leave.  Well, the guys out front didn't want to turn away our group, which consisted of six girls and two guys.  They ended up comping the cover.  We squeezed our way to the bar while the hostess put a table together for our group.  I felt like I was back in a college bar.  Lots of elbowing and the bartender helps out the good looking girls first.  We managed to get our drinks pretty quickly, but man, they were weak.  Finally, after twenty minutes, we managed to get a table in the very front of the restaurant (far away from the dance floor) where no one else was. There's also a balloon guy, but good luck getting him to get to your table on a busy Saturday night. It's also so dark and loud - it's really more like a club on Saturday.  Good luck having a conversation without yelling at each other.\\n\\nFOOD & DRINKS (1/5): I'm not picky when it comes to bar food, but seriously... The food was basically cold by the time we got it.  I'm not sure whether the kitchen messed up or if our server took too long to come by and get it.  Either way, it's inexcusable.  We ate our food reluctantly, knowing that if we had asked for it to be remade, it would have taken forever.  Our orders were pretty standard and no special orders (i.e. food allergies or complicated orders).  \\n\\nSERVICE (1/5): As a former server, I get it.  Late nights are awful, and you have a horrible crowd.  I tend to be more forgiving of servers, but notsomuch with this one.  Our server was rushing us to get an order in, but then we waited forever for the food to arrive.  Once it arrived (cold, by the way), she was nowhere to be found.  We couldn't even tell her about the cold food.  We waited for another half hour after finishing to get our checks.  No matter how fun the dance floor seemed, we just wanted to leave Se√±or Frogs.\\n\\nSo, I'll have to say no to Se√±or Frogs.  Lo siento, Se√±or Frog."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Cambridge Common has the great combination of decent, cheap food and excellent beer.

The only \\"bad seat\\" I saw would be the table closest to the restrooms, but all other tables (at the bar, near the bar, by the window, outside the window) all offered a good vantage point. We liked the half booth/table we got across from the bar, as we had extra room to sit next to or across from each other. \\n\\nFor drinks, we had the persephone (pomegranate and asti) and a bloody mary. Both drinks were well-made and delicious, the first a sweet alternative to a mimosa, and the second with a strong, spicy kick. Note: the drink menu is a separate menu available in the condiment caddy on the side of or in the middle of your table. \\n\\nBoth the salmon hash and portabello scramble came with slices of toast, which we smothered with the pot of marionberry jam. That local jam on each table was heavenly. Definitely help yourself to it!\\n\\nThe hash was 70% potato and 30% salmon, coated in a leek-based cream sauce. I wish it had more salmon, as every piece I found was delicious but left me wanting more. After a while, the surplus of potatoes made me feel full yet unsatisfied. The eggs (scrambled) were fine. \\n\\nL asked to have a substitute for her potatoes, and our server could only offer sliced tomatoes for an extra $1. The tomatoes were all right. It would have been nice if they could offer fruit or a vegetable instead. The omelette itself was very dense and cheesy. Neither of us were able to finish it, though we found the mushrooms and spinach a nice change from the potatoes and salmon on my dish. \\n\\nPerhaps we ordered wrong, but we found both dishes a bit too heavy and greasy, particularly with their plentiful portions.

We recently came for brunch and left agreeing something exciting has to change before we decide to ever come back. Most notable from this visit was the orange juice that tasted like Minute Maid from a can (just think a brownish-orange juice and you've got it) and the children's Mac and cheese was just mush. It had some cheese but you could tell there was a ton of flour added to it to make it appear thick and cheesy. Kraft mac and cheese would hit theirs out of the water. Please!

Finally, we scheduled 3 weeks out and got a reservation at a reasonable hour. That led not only to heightened expectations, but also large amounts of skepticism as to whether or not it is really that good. Well, here is a spoiler alert for the rest of the review: not only did it live up to all the expectations, it was one of the best meals I've had around the world and maybe the best we've had so far in Boston (Loyal Nine is the only other contender thus far).\\n\\nEven with a reservation we ended up waiting 15 minutes for our table. That's not a big deal because the bar scene is vibrant and also a lot of interesting libations. From \\"The one in the grapefruit\\" which is actually served in a grapefruit (ingredients are a secret... \\"full of the stuff we like\\") to the wine and beer lists there is something for everyone depending on what mood they are in and what they prefer. The barkeeps were attentive, quick, and friendly all at the same time while serving multiple waves of drinks to the waiting customers and servers to deliver to tables. \\n\\nAfter browsing the menu, hearing about the spicy marinated hamachi belly and fried rice special, and figuring out appropriate ordering off the menu we settled on 5 dishes across the various sections: \\n- Celery Root Tonnato; think modern and healthier version of classic iceberg wedge\\n- Lobster Fra Diavolo; homemade noodles, perfect level of spice, buttery lobster\\n- Spicy Thai Street Noodles; simple yet expertly executed and not oily\\n- Spicy Hamachi Belly over Fried Rice; easily the best dish of the night as the hamachi was buttery and firm with a creeping heat over a full dish (prob 2ish cups) of fried rice that wasn't oily or overly fatty with just the right amount of vegetables to offset the richness of the fish\\n- Octopus a la Plancha; perfectly grilled octopus and smashed, roasted potatoes (similar to how plantains are roasted and then smashed)\\n\\nThe impressive thing about the menu is that it is not a single note or overly heavy on any one type of cuisine or preparation. It borrows from a variety of countries and styles that gives the menu a varied and worldly feeling despite Chef Jamie's reputation for having big, bold, smoky American flare and flavors. There are a few dishes that embrace that side of his creative mind, but it does not define what the menu or his approach to food is. \\n\\nThe one complaint we read about a few were the portion sizes and the prices. Full disclosure, I usually have to eat before or after any tapas dinner or meal due to the sizes/portions of food unless I want to take out a second mortgage. After preparing myself for this kind of situation, I was pleasantly surprised at the ample portions of hamachi belly, grilled octopus, and other dishes that we ordered versus other highly touted tapas restaurants. \\n\\nLittle Donkey may be a special occasion type of dinner for most people due to the price point, but is not one that should be missed for anyone who enjoys a wide variety of food, worldly cuisines, or expertly prepared fare. Further, it is reasonably priced for what you get and offers a true \\"trip around the globe\\" type of experience with all of Chef Jamie's creative dishes. This has elevated it to a \\"must experience\\" dining experience in the Greater Boston area."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"If you want to find this place, look for a line of people waiting outside.

I went for two full-sized cannolis filled with ricotta, one dusted with chocolate chips and the other covered in toasted almond slices.  The outer pastry was perfect.  I often find cannoli pastry to be baked too thick and having an almost deep-fried texture.  But these were perfect.  Not so perfect was the filling, which was way too sweet for my liking.

I am not a big fan of lamb but I figured i would try the gyro sandwich which consists of a mixture of ground beef and lamb seasoned with mixed herbs, all this wrapped in grilled pita bread.\\nLet me just say that the gyro was AMAZING. The spices they used, tzatziki sauce and the fresh tomatoes made it all very tasty.\\nTo top it off every sandwich comes with your choice of rice pilaf, Greek salad or french fries. I opted for the Greek salad which came with home made dressing. \\nThe portions are reasonable, the salad itself was pretty filling if I may say so myself.\\n\\nAll in all, the food here is pretty good and affordable.

I do enjoy the spices, the scrumptious deliciousness, and the simple taste that went along with usual Indian fare and it is a treat anywhere to have such a delicious treat. For me, it was here in Boulder at Mt Everest Indian cuisine restaurant. I arrived here around 12:30pm after having a treat of ice cream at the nearby Glacier ice cream. It was a spur of the moment thing and I knew I did not have Indian food since my birthday in mid September. The restaurant itself was relatively small, but large enough to be intimate and cozy at the same time. Upon entering the restaurant, it was dark, but light enough to see where I was going. Call it mood lighting, but it was middle of the day. lol With that said, I asked the host how much the buffet was and he replied that it was $9.95. Thought that was reasonably awesome, since many fast food options you can get a combo for around that price. Having a buffet of Indian entrees was as a great a value that I have seen. Although the selections were rather limited, I filled up on the usual favorites. \\n\\nMy new favorite is their creamy spinach. Pretty sure they mix cheese with the spinach, although I can't be sure. The tandoori chicken was very nice and must have had more than 2 servings. I ended up loading up on 2 plates with semi heaping portions. I left the restaurant pretty bloated and yes, definitely got my money's worth! At the end of the day, the value and taste is worth gold in my book. Mt Everest serves up awesome Indian cuisine at an affordable price. I also ordered a strawberry lassi also to cap off a delicious meal. Mt Everest Indian cuisine restaurant is located at 4800 Baseline Road in the heart of Boulder. They accept major credit cards as well as cash, so that's always awesome. Since they are attached to the shopping center, parking options are boundless here. Best bet is to come here as early as you can to avoid any issues and get that premium spot next to the restaurant to avoid walking extra. :)\\n\\nThe overall experience here at Mt Everest Indian restaurant can be characterized as being good, positive, a great spot, and casual. The ambiance was nice to have a quiet lunch here in Boulder. Not sure if they have wifi or not, but it was cool to have lunch here. The tandoori chicken is spot on and the buffet, as aforementioned before, is a great value. If you are in the area and craving some naan, do yourself a favor and stop on by. The service is really non existent if you do the buffet. Recommended if you are in the area and need that fix of curry and tandoori to make the day go by better.\\n\\n4.0 stars for the overall experience. 4.5 stars for the food. 3.0 stars for the service, or lack thereof. Still good though.\\n\\nSupport local!\\n\\nB"},{"name":"Donna's Cakes","address":"100 Spring St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Will never ever order again.

The minute we got to the hotel to check in, guess who didn't have their room. The BRIDE AND GROOM! I ended up having the conversation with the general manager on duty that night (7/4/15) and he said to me, \\"I am sorry, but there isn't anything we can do.\\" He offered her another standard king room down the hall from the standard room they set them up with that day. I understand it being booked and that all the suites were occupied, but the general manager did a great job of not doing anything correct for his guests. He didn't call other hotels to find her a suite, he didn't do anything. As a general manager, I would think you would want to fight and try and fix the situation, for the hotel did give her suite to someone else. If you ask me, the guy didn't care one bit about the situation. I have to admit, I may not have been the most friendly, but hey.. its my best friend and her and her almost husband didn't have the room they already paid for. WHAT A BUMMER. Good thing the bride is nothing but sweet, and simply excited to get married to the man she loves. I think I turned into Bridezilla for her. What are you going to do.. Its your best friends most memorable day. Good thing the day wasn't ruined because of the general manager and her standard king room on her wedding night. At least she had an extra room down the hall to not use.\\n\\nSo then I go to my room, I walk out to my balcony to a huge wasp nest outside. I usually wouldn't have said anything for I love all creatures, but my boyfriend is allergic. The hotel removed the wasp nest when we were at the wedding.. So thank you for that. I just hope it was relocated away from where guest sleep at night. I got my first wasp sting a few weeks ago in my sleep.. I really did not want that happening again! YIKES. \\n\\nIn the end, the hotel did house all of the brides guest, it was close to the venue, and I didn't hear of other complaints. I would just work with the skills of the general manager.. It is him who should help to figure a better solution out. Free meal on the hotel, bottle of red wine, something then just \\"Nothing I can do\\" which makes me feel like \\"Stop talking to me and deal with it.\\""},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Dinner with family and friends.

There appeared to be two servers for the bar area, but one disappeared and the other one (at the far end away from where we were sitting) appeared to have no interest in taking an order.  After about 10 minutes the other bartender returned and apologized that he had to leave to go \\"check on a cake.\\"  He was very pleasant and took our orders for drinks and an order of the chocolate almond bread.

The bread was tasty and there was enough for 4 of us to have a piece.  Eventually we were seated at a table on the outdoor patio and after a wait, a very nice but harried waitress came by to take our order.  Our youngest son ordered the $12 red velvet milkshake.  It was over the top in terms of appearance: gobs of whipped cream on top and around the milkshake and full-size red velvet cupcake speared on the straw.  I had a few tastes, the whipped cream sure tasted like Cool Whip (I am an accomplished baker and make a lot of homemade desserts so I know what real whipped cream tastes like), the milkshake just tasted very sweet with no discernible red velvet / chocolate taste, but the cupcake was pretty good.  The entrees were fine, nothing remarkable but nothing was inedible either.  We would go back because our sons (aged 13 and 19) really liked it and loved the cool steam-punk theming.

Is this a sign? \\n\\nWell right behind the chefs is the scent of fresh baked products and a slew of other enticing aromas.... yummy... this is going to be damn good.\\n\\nWe get in and realize this place is huge. it is actually three separate building areas.

The burger was wonderfully unique--full of flavors superior to any other burger I've ever tried. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the ($12) Grand Sandwich--an open-faced hot ham, turkey, bacon, and tomato with Boursin cheese sauce. When I return here, this is what I'll order. I tried a bite, and it was phenomenal. If you're on a tight budget, bypass the burger and order this sandwich!\\n\\nOur waitress was AWESOME! Her name was Anne. Since we were dining at a relatively slow period of the day, Anne took time to talk to us and made great suggestions. We were very thirsty after spending the morning in Animal Kingdom, and Anne did well at keeping up with refills. \\n\\nTwo more little things--drinks and desserts. The pomegranate lemonade is fantastic; order it. And there are four desserts available at lunch. They're tiny little individual sized desserts--$2.99 for one or $9.99 for a platter of all four. Brilliant. And delicious.\\n\\nThank you, Disney, for creating such a magical little cafe."},{"name":"Spoke Wine Bar","address":"89 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in here for a date night with a friend.

About half of our party seemed to enjoy their meals including the birthday girl thankfully. Also the servers were generally friendly. \\n\\nHowever the positives were not enough to outweigh the negatives. One of our party members put in our name at about 6:45. We didn't leave the restaurant until close to 10:30. There's nothing acceptable about this. They don't allow reservations. We got to our table around 8-8:15. Everything else was waiting for food. I get that this is a tourist destination, but you would think a restaurant within a theme park would know how to deal with volume. It seems that is not the case. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes, mine was lackluster. I ordered a broccoli cheddar soup and the wild mushroom chicken risotto. The soup was fine. The risotto was extremely bland. The texture was pleasing, but it had no flavor. My boyfriend ordered the brisket meatloaf. I tasted that and it was pretty good. The desserts look nice. I don't think I'd bother coming back just for dessert though because that line looked like it would easily take 30 minutes or more. One friend ordered the avocado bruschetta for an appetizer.

Except that when Shannon B., Emma D. and I went to Great Bay last night for girl's night out (there's a fish joke in there somewhere), the selections on the prixe fixe menu seemed like their least exciting offerings. And of course, we'd had a few drinks already, which made it all the easier to go screw it, let's order from the far more tantalizing regular offerings.\\n \\nOur oh so congenial server (see Emma's review!) recommended three of the entrees, and they sounded delicious, so we split them. We all thought the tilefish served over vegetable pasta was a bit lackluster with the exception of the delightfully crisped skin on the fish's underside. Great texture can only go so far though. My first bite of the scallops with greens, some sort of sausage or proscuitto and anchovies had me mmmm-ing appreciatively, but halfway through mine, the intense flavors seemed like overkill. I liked having the one, and could see it as an appetizer maybe, but wouldn't want to attempt the plate of all four myself. Even the quinoa-crusted skate, the unanimous favorite of the table, suffered a similar problem, in that I enjoyed the portion I had, particularly the fish itself, but I didn't then want an entire serving. The sort of rubbery texture of the skate needed to be paired with something complimentary, like maybe a thick polenta, instead of the thin foam and very firm fava beans and salty bits of pastrami. The dishes on the whole were fairly good, don't get me wrong, but they certainly could use some re-thinking before I'd find them worth the price.\\n \\nThe dessert we split though, oh man, that suceeded where the entrees failed at being a cohesive blend of awesomeness. The rich, dense chocolate torte was offset perfectly by crunchy praline and a light wasabi ice cream that added just enough of a kick. \\n\\nThe other thing GB got right was the drinks, like Shannon's delicious black tea and peach margarita. It took us a moment to figure out what childhood taste it evoked, but sure enough, it had a striking resemblance to Welch's White Grape Juice. Well, an alcoholic and spicier version of it, but trust us when we say that's a good thing. I'd come back for drinks and dessert for sure, and maybe an appetizer or to give their raw menu a shot.\\n\\nOh, and Great Bay should consider itself lucky I'm not going to deduct more stars for the most egregious use of Flash on a restaurant website ever.

( I still CANNOT get Candy Girl from New Edition out of my head.) The staff was friendly but the food did take quite a while to reach us. We all had the Banh Mi this time; the last time it was fired rice on the go. The fried rice was a huge success. The Banh Mi, however, was a little slight on the flavor but B-I-G on the roll. The roll was delicious and crispy, but there was so much of it that it overshadowed the rest of the ingredients. The meat was flavorful, but very peppery, and there just wasn't enough of it. I did love the fact that the vegetables come on the side rather than on the sandwich since we have an anti-cilantro child in the mix and cilantro literally ruins his entire day (it's okay, more for me). Oh, and the Banh Mi is HUGE so you may want to plan to share.

Basically it was bacon wrapped quail. The quail itself was tasty but the bacon wrapping it was limp and soggy.  I was disappointed that it was not crispy or at least a little crisp.  It was supposed have some Jalapeno cream cheese but I don't recall anything like that showing up on my plate. The best thing on the plate were the green chili grits.

What I have tried:\\n\\nCrispy Wild Boar Ribs - Lambert's take on buffalo wild wings, spicy with blue cheese dipping sauce, these are so good.\\n\\nBeer Battered Florida Rock Shrimp - the shrimp themselves have a very light honey glaze that is enjoyable.  This is offset by a ranch dip that is very heavy on the buttermilk giving it a very mellow ranch taste.  Another great combo.\\n\\nLambert's Baked Mac and 3 Cheeses - At least one of these cheeses was velveta because it had that characteristic gooy bright yellow texture and taste.  Fantastic mac and cheese with a nice crust on top.\\n\\nBurssel Sprouts, Bacon, and Brown Butter - Make sure to dip them in the brown butter at the bottom, it really ties this dish together.  Anytime you put brussel sprouts with bacon though the results come out amazing.\\n\\nJalapeno & Garlic Roasted Broccoli - Another nice vege dish.  It is surprisingly mild, you don't get overwhelming heat from the jalapeno or the garlic but they are there nonetheless.\\n\\nNatural Hanger Steak - The Cholula Butter gives this an interesting tangy taste, with citrus notes from the lime.  I didn't think the flavor was that special, not enough to justify the toughness of this cut of meat.\\n\\nMustard and Brown Sugar Crusted Ribeye - Of the two steaks I liked this one better for my tastes.  Where the previous steak favored salty, tangy, citrus type flavors, this steak balances the sweetness of the sugar with the spice of the mustard and the heat from the garlic squeezed right onto the ribeye.  There is nothing like a delicious medium rare piece of steak with melty garlic on top.\\n\\nColorado Lamb Chops with Habenero Mint Jelly - This is hands down one of the best dishes I have had anywhere in quite some time.  The Habenero mint jelly on its own was a masterpiece, but when paired with a perfectly cooked medium rare lamb which had some acidity to counterbalance the jelly, was perfection."},{"name":"Waterloo Ice House Southpark Meadows","address":"9600 S Ih 35 Frontage Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start by saying we've always come here for good burgers and while this dining experience was pretty bad they made up for it with customer service you don't see often anymore. \\n\\nA couple weeks ago some friends and I stopped for a late lunch/early dinner.

It was so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation at our table. The buffet is set up in such a way that the wait staff coming out of the kitchen would bump through the line to get to the dining room. It would be a bit more tolerable if they would break up the buffet into stations to minimize the congestion. (steamed seafood, fried seafood, veggies, sides, etc)\\n\\nThe food was OK at best. I know, it's a buffet and I accept that but the quality of the  preparation has seriously declined over our last visit.

It will forever be my favorite PDX Pod, not just due to its delicious food carts, and not just because it's open until 3:00 am. \\n\\nIt's because Cartopia saved my life, as well as my entire trip to Portland.\\n\\nThe hubs and I were supposed to arrive in PDX early to start our eating and drinking vacation, but when we finally staggered wearily off our hours-delayed plane, it was 11:30 pm. Another unexpected snafu at the hotel took hours to resolve. By the time we addressed our hunger, it was 2 am. In dismay we knew most restaurants had closed hours ago.\\n\\nExhausted, shivering with cold and starving to death, we had no idea what to do. Tears filled our eyes as we hopelessly considered settling for a greasy, weeks-old hot dog at a gas station. What a terrible way to start out our foodie vacation! Without much hope, we turned to our iPhone and Yelp to seek out any kind of late night sustenance.\\n\\n\\"Hey, here's a place called 'Whiffies' that claims to be open,\\" the hubs said, his voice daring to hold a note of hope. I nodded miserably, unhappily picturing a dirty, run down Denny's type establishment with a cranky waitress serving me gross food.  \\n\\nWhen we pulled up to the address, at first we didn't quite understand - there was no restaurant. But there was friendly bonfire smoke curling warmly into the cold night sky from what appeared to be the center of a small circus grouping of tents across the street. There were people in thick jackets and knit caps milling about a fire or sitting on park benches, eating. And then it dawned on us. Could it ...be? Gasp! IT WAS A FOOD POD. An honest to goodness grouping of PDX Food Carts. We stood there for a moment, mouths agape, hardly daring to believe our good fortune. \\n\\nSuddenly awake, I jumped out of the idling car, determined to run over to the pod before the miraculous mirage of it could disappear. \\"Go park the car and meet me there!\\" I gasped, shivering in a jacket too thin for the bracing night air. Undeterred by the cold, I bounded across the street. The hubs parked somewhere (you can't park across from the pod, there are signs warning against it) and found me standing next to the bonfire with happy tears brimming my eyes. \\"Look....just look!\\" I whispered, pointing with a trembling finger at six magnificent food carts. \\n\\nThe first cart was the sought-after \\"Whiffies.\\" Instead of my much-feared diner food, it served Fried Pies, both savory and sweet. Other carts were \\"Bubba Bernies\\" (Cajun), \\"Perierra Creperie\\" (amazingly huge crepes), \\"El Brasero\\" (Mexican) \\"Potato Champion\\" (Belgian style frites & poutine) and, glory of glories, \\"Pyro Pizza\\", a cart with a wood-fired pizza oven so huge it took up most of the interior space. We could not believe our luck. Thanks to \\"Whiffies\\", we had accidentally hit upon the Mother of All Late Night Food Pods. \\n\\n\\"We are about to have our first food cart experience, and I have a feeling it's gonna be great,\\" whispered the hubs, the gentle steam of his warm breath slowly ascending into the frigid night air.  He held me close as we gazed about at all of our many choices. Faint and dying (seriously) from starvation, we couldn't decide on just one item. \\n\\nWe first wobbled up rather giddily to \\"Whiffies\\" and purchased a fried meat pie, BBQ Beef Brisket with Mozzarella. The girl behind the cart had very kind eyes and a ready smile. She quickly cooked and delivered a delectable-looking pie into hands shaky with hunger. Oh MAN was that pie delicious. \\n\\nWe were still greedily devouring it as we ordered a generous serving of amazing poutine from \\"Potato Champion\\".  Again we met with very nice purveyors who kindly answered our questions and quickly served our food. Nothing could have prepared me for the out-of-body experience I had eating those hand-cut, twice-fried fries drenched in savory gravy and piled high with creamy cheese curds. \\n\\nThe only thing that could eclipse that experience, the hubs suggested, might be a hot-off-the-bricks Italian pizza, so we finished off our now-magical dining experience with the pie of the night from \\"Pyro Pizza\\". The crispy, whole-wheat crust was glazed with a delicate white sauce and adorned with a symphony of toppings: roasted potatoes, onions, garlic, and thick slices of artisanal pepperoni nestled down into a melty mound of cheddar, mozzarella and Romano cheeses, all accompanied by a huge dollop of crema. It was out-of-this-world fantastic.\\n\\n\\"You know what, honey?\\" the hubs mumbled contentedly around a delicious mouthful of oven-baked pizza.\\n\\nI looked up with eyes shining brightly with happiness, wiping heavenly poutine gravy from my my chin.  \\"What, darling?\\" I asked, snuggling into his arms sleepily under the cover of the warm tent.\\n\\n\\"I think this is the start of what's going to be a truly fantastic and very memorable trip.\\"\\n\\nAnd thanks to Cartopia, it really, really was."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"So... before I begin my reasoning of just 2 stars let me begin by saying, the food (both entree and dessert) are to die for.

As a local of Boston I eat on the North End EVERY SAT night, and we found rather odd how so many in this Italian business district tell us, Mike's is like McDonalds, or their cannolis are frozen etc.  Yet every time we brought cannolis or lobster tails they were delish and our friends we bring them home for went out of their minds.  After finding it odd, SEEING A PATTERN that the people of Boston think it's their job to tell people not to go to Mikes, I decided to investigate. Can everyone be wrong I said?  Maybe I think Mike's is good, but maybe the others are better?  So my wife and I went to Mike's and bought a Florentine cannoli and a plain shell chocolate chip cannoli plain ricotta filling. Then we went to Modern Pastry and bought a chocolate chip plain ricotta filling cannoli.  There are many places that sell cannolis in the North End but Modern comes highly recommended so we went there.  In our room we separated the 2 plain shell chocolate chip cannolis.  I had my back turned and eyes closed, and first I had my wife let me taste the filling of each one with me not knowing which one was which.  The filling was delicious in both samples, but I said the first one, but by a slight margin if I had to pick one.  I chose Mikes.  Then she let me taste a small piece of each of the entire cannoli, shell and filling, and she said I chose Mikes.  But they were both good.  Then I gave my wife the same tests, she also chose Mikes with the filling taste and the full cannoli sample of each.  We both agreed the shell was very hard in sample #2 which was Modern.  Here is why.  Notice at Mike's they advertise \\"Handmade Homemade Shells\\".  They are the only one that do!  The Florentine cannoli shell was so fresh at Mikes I had traces of peanut oil they fried the shell in on my fingers. Mikes hand makes their shells and people have the nerve to call Mikes frozen, a frozen cannoli, really people?  You think that place got that popular selling thawed out cannolis?  Modern, Maria's and others will fill the shell (they did not make) in front of you to order, opposed to Mikes where the 18 varieties will come out already filled in trays.  There is a line around the corner for Mike's Pastry, if Mike's had to fill each cannoli upon order there would be a line back to the Zakim bridge.  So people take advantage of this and add shelf life to the cannolis going as far as calling them frozen when they were out for about 5 to 15 minutes as trays are constantly coming out to serve supply in demand.  One time I wanted a chocolate covered cannoli and the girl said wait a few minutes they are coming out, & they did in about 4 minutes, so they are being made continuously.  This reminds of a very popular restaurant in 1992 that had lines out the door, and in mid 95 a rumor spread like wild fire they they were recycling their food.  It ended up being a rumor started by a local competitor who was frustrated seeing the lines of people going in that restaurant.  This is what is going on in the North End of Boston. There are many cafe's and shops that sell pastry and they see a line whipped around Mikes Pastry extending into the other street and they are frustrated that Mike's is getting all the business. Stop the lies, and stop poisoning people minds that visit Boston!  Get the facts straight like I did that Mike's is the only place in Boston that hand makes their own shells.  They are the only shop that has 18 different cannolis with and extra pumpkin spice cannoli this season.  Now all these shops in the best little Italy in the US know how to make awesome fresh ricotta filling, they're all good.  You think these Italian businesses have been around in that area for decades not knowing how to create ricotta?  Get real.  They are all good on the North End but Mike's is the King of the Cannoli.  This is not designed to take business away from anyone.  Go to Maria's and taste her homemade Italian cookies.  Go to Modern and try their awesome cheese cakes, peanut butter cupcakes, so much good pastry in these stores, you have visit them all, good stuff.  Back to the cannolis, the ones we tasted side by side in blind taste test were both good, but the fresh shell was a big factor.  The shell at Mike's is MUCH softer because it is homemade in house, Modern, Maria's have a hard crispy shell.  Modern admits they buy their shells from the Golden Cannoli in Somerville MA, & the Golden Cannoli stated their shell can last 365 days frozen, so which place has the questionable shelf life? Maria's said me they did not make the shells. The Food Network confirmed (you tube) that Mike's makes 5000-7000 shells a day, do the research.  So stop trying to slam this place that has the best cannoli is Boston and perhaps America.  Stop the rumors, my research can be verified.

Mike's pastry serves up large and delicious cannolis. I have only stuck to the basic ones, the original cannoli and the original with chocolate chips, both are great! \\n\\nI also love how you can purchase cannolis for shipping. They package ten shells and include the filling in a piping bag. They also give the chocolate chips for the ends.

I like the pad ordering system. I appreciate the staff; you can tell they enjoy their jobs and they work hard. I like the story of how ruths chris got started, Ruth was spunky business savy lass! I hate her steaks used to be $8 bucks and now they are damn near $60! Was she a marketing genius or what? \\n\\nRuths chris is synonymous with elegance and class. What I don't like is how they have become lax on the dress code which is why I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars. I'm not saying \\"ghetto people\\" shouldn't eat here but I am saying I would appreciate if I can get 2 children 3 and 4 dressed appropriately for the restaurant and keep them in line not to disturb anyone's dinning experience I would appreciate if \\"Marqueez\\" and \\"keyshawnesha\\" (real names I over heard other members of their party say greeting these people's late arrival, that's how loud they were) came in there dressed presentable and not dressed in ball caps, jordans, sagging jeans, and the females dressed like a thots (thots = hood boogers). Their whole entourage looked like a low budget rap video or like they heard ruths chris offered a bmz club back drop with champagne bottles airbrushed on it. As if the females were all ready to pop over and the dudes get into the prison stance to take a group picture. Lol I'm cracking jokes but I'm serious, I'm tired of uncouth people. I could see if this was isolated incident but it's like this everytime I come **insert ratchet names or entourage here** Please don't lower your standards any further ruths chris! \\n\\nOn to the food, I can't lie the food is pricey. Is it worth it you ask? No... if it was up to me I would lower the prices by $10 -$12 per entree, $3 per appetizer/salad. Now if they do this in conjunction to **coughs that scam obamacare** I understand everyone takes a pay cut but corporate. Yeah.... corporate greed at its finest but I digress. If the food and the service weren't good I honestly wouldn't be back at these prices especially when long horn offers a good steak. I sincerely apologize but a cow is a cow to me, whether it's grass fed or cannibal lol all kidding aside I like the place, it's swanky, and the service is stellar. \\n\\nIn some cases you get what you pay for so it's a necessary evil I will happily pay. 5 out of 4 stars for being some what lax on their dress code policy. Dress codes are put in place as a detourant, I see how it tap dances on the line of discrimination but I've been to restaurants that don't allow children because children can ruin a dinning experience. Especially for those who dont have children or are planning a date night getting away from their own damn kids. So if a restaurant can refuse children, refuse people dressed like typical riff raff. Observing obnoxious riff raff ruins my dinning experience. Just my opinion, but I'm sure others who work hard for their money like me who want to be away from that type of element agree."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went in late tonight for a cannoli.

So this is the only donut review I'm making. Now you have to keep in mind it's kinda an apples vs pears type comparison here. \\n\\nPip's little donuts of love are made to order so they come out crisp and warm. The inside is soft but not crumbly. Each topic you choose is fresh and generously applied. The maple bacon was probably the best version of maple bacon I have ever had. The mix of finely chopped bacon candied with maple syrup made for an explosive amazing bite. Definitely my favorite out our order. Not throwing shade at the rest either. The cinnamon donuts were ridiculous. The Nutella was good too. I tried a marion berry jam donut because it was seasonal. It was tart and worth trying. While the other donut places makes their craft daily, they aren't necessarily made to order. Something way better about a fresh warm donut vs a donut that has been sitting for a few hours. \\n\\nOne of the other things I liked about Pip's was the atmosphere. I couldn't help notice all of the families with young ones. There was even a family celebrating a one-year old party with the celebrant trying her first donut ever. It screamed come and sit down and bond over a couple dozen. People were taking with each other. Not one single person staring into their phone or laptop off in a corner. There was life here. Perhaps that is why I bought a Pip's decal for my flask.

This cost me $16.  So how were those tacos?\\n\\nThe Steak taco was cooked medium well, cooked VERY well, as it bursted with flavor and was actually medium well.  It was wrapped in a flour shell and stuffed with onion and came with an avocado salsa verde.  Really enjoyed the steak taco.\\n\\nThe Carnitas taco was both juicy but crispy pieces too.  This pork belly piece of meat was REALLY good, but it was also kinda greasy. Also on the pork belly was this guava glaze that made it taste slightly sweet, along with onion, and avocado salsa verde.  Also wrapped in a flour shell, if they cut out some of the grease, this would be an amazing taco.  As it stands, right now it's really good!\\n\\nThe Tacos de barbacoa is a slow cooked brisket on a corn tortilla, which comes with cilantro, cabbage, and guac.  The flavor of the barbacoa was good, though this was my least favorite of the three tacos.  That's not to say it was bad....just that the others were really great.  Still, i'd pass on this one next time in favor of another type of protein.\\n\\nAll other things, including the rice, refried beans, and the small piece of the tamale I tried were all pretty good.  The tacos were the main event for me though, so I didn't have very much of the beans, rice or tamale for it to make a difference in my review.\\n\\nSuperica holds quite a bit of real estate in KSM, taking almost the entire left front corner of KSM.  Plenty of seats both inside and outside, and parking is based off of community parking via the market.\\n\\nI like Superica.

It's definitely one of my favorite shakes EVER. It's really rich but not too thick like a shake at sonic. \\n\\nI really liked the location of this Hopdoddy! They have outdoor seating with umbrellas (so you can sit in the shade if it's sunny) and candles to keep away mosquitoes. It definitely has a nicer ambience than the ones on Anderson and S. Congress.

On their website,  \\"We are on the Best 35 Restaurants\\".\\n\\nI've heard (not yet tasted) of the Filipino Empanada, I thought I'd try that! I couldn't find anything else on the menu I wanted, so I let my husband order whatever he likes.  He ordered the 1/4th chicken with beans and rice and the Inka Cola (made by Coca-Cola), which was unusually good, but I'd rather have no carbonated drink.  It's yellow!\\n\\nOur waiter keeps apologizing, about our meal because of the Empanada.  That's OK, we weren't sure how long, but he came to apologized to us 2-3x and now I'm starting to wonder. We were the only 3rd one in the room @ that time, but while eating there were three more tables came in, so it wasn't that busy when we got there. So, he handed us a wrapped cookie, before we got our meals. \\n\\nNever mind about that, let's move on to the food.  My Empanada came in, it looked presentable, I actually enjoyed it! Hubby's chicken I wanted a piece of his chicken wing, but it looked raw. (see photo).  He was starving! But he tried not to eat too close to the bone. What if we ordered half of a chicken, the leg would be more raw, but this is the chicken wing. . . I'm trying not to imagine what the leg would be like.  I was grossing out, & at the same time trying to eat my Empanada with chicken & raisins.  It was fried in oil, so I am pretty sure they were cooked! I saw some sliced olives in there, but where are the raisins? I  started to wonder, and I started to look for them as I sliced them with my fork,  and I counted ONE raisin.  OK, let me say this again, they were good!\\n\\nHubby told me, they weren't that great, and he was disappointed! \\n\\nThe wrapped cookie, covered with white powder sugar?

The venue was pretty crowded and loud, there was less than 5 feet between us and each other table. \\n\\nFood and drink: we started with the flight of ice wine and the house poutine. This was probably the most disappointing part of the experience. The ice wine was extremely sweet and did not live up at all to its 27$ price tag. The entire flight added up to maybe 1 glass of wine, and my girlfriend and I struggled through getting them down due to the intense sugary flavor. The poutine was EXTREMELY salty. I don't think this was a subjective sort of thing, it was actually tough to eat because how intensively salty it was. Next we had the porterhouse for 2, which came out to $119. The presentation was nice, and the mushroom risotto and lobster mac and cheese it came with were very good (but very small portions). The featured meat, however, was very disappointing. It was presliced on a large presentation dish, and of the 10 slices of New york strip I had, 8 of the pieces had tough pieces of tendon and fat that were literally inedible. I had to spit multiples pieces in to a napkin. My girlfriend had a similar experience with her filet portion. I have had much better quality meat from my local supermarkets, for a fraction of the price.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would highly reccomend against going here.

HCT offers two levels of heat:  hot and holy.  I opted for the hot, and it was enough for me, but the burn was different...since a lot of the heat was from cayenne, it was rubbed into the chicken.  It wasn't one of those \\"hits you in the back of the throat\\" burns, it was a good heat, mitigated with ranch dipping sauce.  And when we were done, the burn didn't last long in my mouth, although I think my lips felt a bit tingly for an hour or so after.\\n\\nFor this April event of HCT, you had a choice of dark or white meat.  Each platter came with two pieces of chicken, accompanied by some delicious mac-n-cheese, vinegar-based cole slaw, several pickle slices, and two pieces of white bread.  The chicken is stacked on top of the white bread so that the bread soaks up a bit of the chicken juices and spiciness.  I recommend dipping that piece of bread in a bit of the ranch.  Yum.\\n\\nThe chicken itself was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy on the inside.  It's a huge portion; I only ate about half of it.  While the outside isn't \\"saucy\\", it's still quite messy.  Being the uber-planner that I am, I brought some wipes with me, which were much appreciated by our group.\\n\\nI'm not sure if HCT will be changing locations, but the April event was held at a co-op on the East Side of town, a place which is ok for a Sunday afternoon, but not so sure I would go there at dark.  They had a picnic table set up to enjoy the meal there.  They had another table with sweet tea and water.  If you get your food to go, be sure to ask for napkins and plasticware.  And if they can get you some wipes, grab some of those too.\\n\\nI think this is going to become quite the destination point once word gets out.  If you're interested in trying it, they are doing invitation-only dinners right now, so get on their website and sign up for their newsletter so you can find out when the next event is happening.  Here's how it works:\\n\\n- sign up for the newsletter\\n- receive an email invitation to buy tickets\\n- select a pick-up time\\n- select white or dark meat\\n\\nYou'll want to act quickly once the invitation comes out.  The day I got my invitation (8 or 9 AM), I went to buy tickets at lunchtime and the first pick-up time sold out.  If I recall correctly, HCT's Facebook page indicated tickets were sold out within 24 hours.  That's a good position for a business to be in.\\n\\nBest of luck to you guys, HCT.  I look forward to my return visit, tissues, wipes, and napkins in hand.\\n\\nPS--I forgot--watch out for this:  the \\"hot\\" and \\"holy\\" look the same--you would expect the \\"holy\\" to perhaps be redder, but it's not.

Mmmmm, I must be in heaven. After diong some research with the 3 Boston Lobster Feast, this one appeared to look the most decent from the photos online. From the outside, it appeared like a normal restaurant. We decided to go to Boston Lobster Feast one evening for dinner. We got in around 7:30pm, and the restaurant was moderately busy, with about 15 of the 25 tables occupied. There was also a full bar room with several TVs with sports and game shows on, with several stools and a few tables I believe. The maitre-d sat us immediately as there were tables available. She dropped two menus and informed us that our waiter would be right with us shortly. We waited about 5-8 minutes before the waiter finally came over to ask us if we would be ordering from the menu or opting for the buffet. We both opted for the buffet, and he informed us that we can also order a couple things that were not available at the buffet: french fries, lobster bisque, and one or two other items that did not raise an eyebrow. I decided to go for the lobster bisque. The waiter then informed us how the establishment operated, dishes are located on the right, next to the dessert bar. Just beyond the dessert bar was the counter for raw oysters, raw clams, crab claws, peel & eat shrimp, and 1-2 different types of rolls. To the left of that, there was another counter for the hot food ranging from new england clam chowder, marinated mushrooms, some cold salads, southwest chipotle mussels, fried clams, fried fish, hush puppies, steamer clams, baked fish, prime rib, snow crab legs, boiled lobster, and a few other items. It just did not feel like there was much else and I felt very limited in choices. Most of the food did not look appetizing nor very fresh. The prime rib (cut to order) sitting under the infrared light looked like it was sitting there for a while, the clam chowder looked like it hasn't been stirred for over an hour, the raw clams/oysters looked a little unfresh, rolls did not look fresh at all, and pretty much all the rest of the food did not look appetizing. I was able to overlook most of the food in expectations for the boiled lobsters. Walking to the left side of the hot food counter, a man will serve you only one lobster at a time. He put my lobster on my dish and it was SMALL, looking like a measly 1 lber and one claw was missing. I'm guessing they used the lobster claw to make the lobster bisque. Lobster should usually be tender/soft and melt in your mouth. The lobster here was a huge disappointment as it was overcooked, chewy and a bit tough. The melted butter helped it to go down a little better, but it was still very tough. Only the meaty (palm) of the claw was slightly soft. Somehow I still wound up eating maybe 5-6 lobsters, but definitely not at all satisfied with the lobster. I grabbed the other food and was not amazed by anything here, most food overcooked, bland, or just plain out disappointing. I don't really know what else to say. The lobster bisque was decent, but it tasted a bit salty after my 3rd or 4th spoonful. The dessert bar had several cakes and cookies, the chocolate cake was decent, cookies also good but slightly stale.\\n\\nService was impeccable. I felt as if I were in a restaurant, as our own personal waiter came over every 5 minutes to ask if we needed anything else, dropping off napkins, refilling our glasses, and cleaning up our used dishes. Only once or twice (out of the 10-12 times he came by) did I find myself, inconveniently sitting with used dishes on the table. His name was Ronnie and he is also quite a chatty guy if you try to talk to him.\\n\\nBathrooms were decent and bearable, but not superbly clean or tooo dirty.\\n\\nOur buffet meal came out to $39.95/person which was definitley not worth it, and not to forget the lack of variety of food, and food that did not look appealing nor taste very fresh. The only thing that went above and beyond my expectations was the waiter service. For that, I will give Boston Lobster Feast 2 stars.

They have a great, ever-changing beer list that never fails to please (even better, order a few different samplers of four -- same cost as a draft -- and pass them around).  They have waitstaff, that, while seemingly ever-changing as well, is unfailingly cheerful and prompt.  They  have a very good but un-fussy burger -- I myself am hooked on the black angus -- that arrives with any of a variety of delectable cheeses and goodies on top.  The sweet potatoes fries are the best -- but the regular and curly's come in a close second.\\n\\nPretty much everything on the menu is very good, quality but un-fancy and affordable.  I think the lowest part of the menu is the sandwiches and occasional panini that shows up there, but when the burgers, entrees, salads, and appetizers are so yummy, I'm not complaining.  \\n\\nMostly Cambridge Common is just comfy.

We strolled down Harvard ave while we waited for our table. \\n\\nThe small mistake I made was not ordering a Jewish specialty dish when the place is known for its Jewish specials. My omelette was a little overcooked so the eggs were a bit dry. I got the Lenox omelette though so luckily the goat cheese filling helped mask the dry eggs. That being said....When you're at Zaftigs, get the specialty stuff. My mom got the combo whitefish plate and it was delicious, comes with all the fixings. Others got the matzo brie which was good, and the cheese blintz were yummy also. The latkes are a MUST ORDER.

It's literally just a cup of tea in a fancy bulb-like glass that has the exact same amount of water as their mugs, that you then transfer into your mug. So they just waste an extra glass to make it fancy? I'm not really sure. But I was a little under the weather when I went for breakfast and wanted a nice little pot of tea so I wouldn't have to keep asking for more hot water and waiting for the server to bring it to me. She told me it was for one person (I guess to avoid sharing a drink and losing money on a second drink order) but it still wasn't a \\"pot of tea\\" in any way shape or form.

The two most common types of restaurants where Chinese buffets and authentic (sometimes not so authentic) Mexican food.

We really wanted Thai food, but the Thai place we liked around the corner had just closed so we couldn't go there.  We searched Yelp for a bit, naming random restaurants and shooting them down for a lack a vegetarian options, and then came across Taste of Mexico.  After seeing that they had a very vegetarian friendly menu we decided we'd go and give it a try.\\n\\nThe weather was nice, so we sat outside, as did everyone else who was there at that time.  The waiter was friendly and quick about getting us menus and water.  We looked through the menu at all the things we hadn't eaten at a restaurant for ages trying to decide.  Do I want enchiladas?  Tacos?  Burritos?  Finally I decided on getting their vegetarian Chile Rellenos, while my girlfriend decided on vegetable fajitas.  We got horchatas to drink.\\n\\nWhile we waited we snacked on chips and salsa, which was very good.  The salsa had a great flavor, a little spicy without destroying your mouth.  After a very short wait our food came out to us, and it was delicious.  The chile rellenos were a little colder than I would have liked, but the quality of the food was great.  The fajitas that my girlfriend got were delicious as well.  After finishing we got our check and found that the we hadn't been charged for the fajitas due to a special that was going on.

We got Chicken Satay, Tofu Goreng, Mango Salad, Roti Canai, Sambal Green Beans, Panggang Fish, Gulai Seafood, Mee Goreng, Eggplant Fries and the Goreng Pisang. I know. There were lots to pack though!! \\n\\nChicken Satay - SO SOFT. The peanut sauce was nice too. I wish there was a little more crunch on the sauce but I'm not complaining!! \\n\\nTofu Goreng - I've never had this anywhere else so def unique to me. I am not a fan of cucumbers and I attempted to eat them in this dish but just couldn't push myself to do it. Love the peanuts sprinkled on top and the veggies in it. The mixed textures of the soft tofu and crispness of the deep fried portion was nommm. \\n\\nMango Salad - I didn't have too much of the Mango Salad due to the cucumbers. I know!! I should have sucked it up. I'm sure it was delicious though as the rest of my family ate it all. \\n\\nRoti Canai - Crowd favourite!! Roti itself is soft and crispy on the edges. The sauce I think is maybe laksa?? I'm no expert but definitely my favourite. We ordered two!! HEHEHE \\n\\nSambal Green Beans - UGH. My fav dish. Seriously. Love how fresh the beans were. The prawns that were in it for NOT overcooked at all which was a plus. Not too salty where I had to eat it with rice. Perfect veggie dish. \\n\\nPanggang Fish - WARNING!! This dish is SALTY. It's not the bad kind but you'll definitely need to eat it with rice. Love the okras in it and the fish pieces are deep fried. There's also a bit of spice to it. Maybe the dish itself was cooked with some fish sauce or shrimp paste but def a fishy smell to it. Don't be put off though!! For sure would order again!! \\n\\nGulai Seafood - A basic yellow curry. Lots of different seafoods like mussels, clams, fish and prawns. I'm not too sure if there were squids or not as we boxed up the rest and I didn't take the box home with me. There are veggies in it as well so it makes a good dish that you could possibly just get on its own with a side of rice. \\n\\nMee Goreng - Tasty!! A bit of a kick to it but not bad at all. It almost tastes like the Chinese stir fried beef with the flat noodles in that brown sauce. There are beef, tofu and I saw some prawns. So good!! One of my favourite dishes as well!!! Can't wait to eat my leftovers for lunch. \\n\\nEggplant Fries - WOW. The texture of the eggplant is really weird. I'm sure the outside is breaded and it was deep fried but it almost felt like the inside of the fries were hollow. There was a hint of the eggplant and the rest was more of a salted and spiced batter. It came with sweet and sour sauce drizzled on top. Might be best to get the sauce on the side as there are a lot of the fries and you might want to pack them without the sauce soaking the fries!! \\n\\nGoreng Pisang - THIN BATTER. THIS. I can't emphasize enough how much I appreciate this. I cannot stand thick, almost breaded, batter on my bananas. It just takes away from the bananas themselves... Loved every bite of it and the maple syrup was definitely a plus. AND PEANUT!! Like a banana sundae MMM... \\n\\nOverall, really enjoyed my dinner. Reservations were needed for my little group as it was very busy when we arrived. Our server was quick to fill our tea and water but never really checked out often to see how our food was (we had lots of dishes swapped out for new food that was coming).

I get it, Orlando is a tourist trap. Its like eating dinner at an airport and being happy the food wasn't that terrible. Top Golf uses their location to justify atrocious customer service. \\n\\nTo set the scene, after arriving to the golf bay, there is a table with menu's where Top Golf hopes to double dip on entertainment and dining expenses. An hour with the driving range is ordered, along with an appetizer and a pitcher of beer.  About 20 minutes later a food order is also put in. After our hour of golf hit the 45 minute mark we opted out of renewing for an additional hour. \\n\\nImmediately after declining, a gentlemen with glasses (no lenses)(douche) immediately pressured us to either buy more time or leave the table after it expired. We mentioned food was ordered and that it had not arrived. He said it could be delivered elsewhere. We reluctantly purchased more time with the driving range to avoid the hassle of moving. This was after all, the point where our food was being prepared by waitstaff behind closed walls. Opting not to make too big of a scene seemed like the safest call. Nothing against the support staff in Orlando. They were mostly genuine and one could tell very easily, they all knew their company's process is shit.

Do not focus on anything but eating, the tab is running.\\n\\nOur group of 3 ordered a few pitchers of beer, appetizers and meals.

A broad selection of BBQ, all with a modern twist. Good sides, and a good beef (mostly steak) selection. \\n\\nThis place is a good blend of new with old. It's not over the top trendy like other reviewers suggest. Although the Austin neighborhood around it tends to be that way. This is still a place that looks like a nice refurbished old building with a sports/music bar upstairs. The aesthetics fit with the menu. \\n\\nI started with the Boar ribs. Maybe the best thing I remember eating all year. Perfectly cooked. Very spicy. Fantastic start. \\n\\nThen I had a combo of pulled pork and brisket. I couldn't have been more excited waiting for the entrees to arrive. I am a big fan of BBQ, and these are two of my favorites - pulled pork and coffee-flavored brisket. The meal was a little slow to arrive, but the bartender was good about noticing that and rectified the situation. However, I could not have been more disappointed when the food arrived. \\n\\nThe LED lights overhanging the bar didn't help, but both the brisket and pulled pork all glistened in the lights due to being way too fatty. I managed to eat about half of each only because I was so intent on trying, but it was a struggle. The flavors in both were good - you could definitely tell that the place had potential. But both needed another couple of hours on the smoker. \\n\\nThe food presentation was good. The sides of pickled veggies were great. The sides of fries and jicama slaw were solid. But I can't get past how way too fatty the meats were. \\n\\nThis place has a lot of potential. The interior was clearly designed by talented people, and the menu constructed by people who understand current food trends and have an ability to adapt traditional foods to modern times. But the execution of the meats was completely unacceptable. \\n\\nPlease rectify this situation. So much potential exists in this place.

It takes a certain kind of person to be able to shake off the people that can really make the job miserable. But, it's also very rewarding.\\n\\nI have recently had a severe ankle injury and am unable to work for at least 3 months. Two fractures, one break, 2 severe displacements and severe ligament damage. This has put a major hindrance  in be able to go to sweetgreen and enjoy the healthy diet that I now desperately need  to get back to strength.\\n\\nSo enough blabbing. So I went to a doctors follow up on surgery today with my mother. We were deciding on some place to eat when I begged for sweetgreen which she has never tried.

The lobby has been updated and I would say a very moderate refresh.  There is an odd decline into the elevator at the step, this might indicate that during the lobby renovation they just tiled over the old floor rather than doing a full demo.  The devil is in the details with this property.  The elevators themselves have not been updated since the original hotel elevators were installed.  Paneling has been replaced, but the old button panels remain.  The paint on several different floors is not being kept up and can be seen sluffing off on the air vents and is literally peeling off of the window frames in the rooms.  In the room, the bedding was standard Renaissance faire, clean.  The bed itself for whatever reason is no where near as comfortable as the last Renaissance I just stayed at yesterday in St. Augustine.  The pillows have an odd smell to them, and unlike other Renaissance properties there was a lack of down or synthetic down pillows.  The Flatscreen TV is large and of good quality, but the cleaning of the rest of the room seemed spotty at best.  In the shower there was ALOT of caulking over grout gaps, the shower curtain bar trim was loose on both ends, and there were hairs from previous guests in odd places (like the ceiling of the bathroom and pushed against the edges of the bathroom floor moulding tiles).  The lobby bar attendant was very friendly and courteous,  you can't blame the employees for the tools their management gives them.  Overall I would say Marriott has lost control of this property.  The manager should probably be fired, and the owner needs to spend some real dollars to bring this property up to minimum Marriott standards all around.  Total repair required is in the tens of millions of dollars.

Drove around downtown for a looong time before able to find parking which of course was not their fault but just to fore warn others new to the neighborhood, expect horrible parking situations. It was a little after 9 at night on a wednesday and didnt wait much since it was pretty late already which was a good thing. My girldfriend and I ordered from the menu, pork, short rib, chicken, spicy lamb, and couple of sushi handrolls. I received the lamb and short ribs then the pork a little later but never received the chicken. The sushi handrolls were nothing more than I would expect from a low class conveyor belt fast food sushi place (not fresh). I asked the waiter does the meat come with any sauces for dipping he pointed to a gravy boat / teapot thing which i poured over the meat. The sauce i would assume to be just lightly watered down sugar, soy sauce mixture which essentially made all my meats taste the same. BEWARE, they have posted do not waste food or they will charge you, which is not hard to do because i ate the little that they brought, paid my $50 dollars for two people and left realizing i got ripped off.\\n\\nWould I ever recommend this place to any of my friends?

However, the worst aspect was the recurring theme of price over quality. The one that took the cake was the white asparagus. I don't know how you can in good conscious serve two pieces of white asparagus for $18. Also, who cooks cured ham if you're touting its quality? I don't mind paying a pretty penny if the food is worth it, but it was simply not.

The crab legs were so salty, it made me sick to my stomach. I tried a different batch. Same thing. In addition to the overwhelming saltiness, there was NO meat in them. You didn't even have to crack them open. Just hold it up to the light and you'll see it's empty. I had to spit the fried clams out, they were so hard. The lobster was extremely chewy. Fried shrimp was mostly batter. I finally asked to speak to a manager to let him know about the product quality. He insisted I let him pick me good crab legs. Alright. He tells me he had to sift through 105 pounds of crab legs to get me the two clusters he did find that were good. Right there. Out of 105 pounds, the only good ones were two clusters, so everyone is guaranteed salty, meat-less crab. The ones he brought out were much better. He also brought out new fried clams and said he made these by the recipe so they should be good. So that's telling me the product that everyone else is getting is poor and not made correctly. He also stated that he agreed about how incredibly salty the legs were and that the reason there's little meat in the crab legs is because it's the end of the season and the crabs have begun to molt. I understand what he's saying, but once again...despite being aware of this, WHY are they still putting out poor quality products?! For $50 a pop, I never need to go back."},{"name":"Blue Dragon","address":"324 A St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place! Period. Food was excellent.

I will definitely be back so I can enjoy the food again, only on fewer dragon bowls than I had this recent trip. Ming was kind enough to stop by our table and say hello (btw, as he has done other times I've been to his restaurants). We had just about every item on the apps/plates menu (humus, sweet potato chips, shrimp shumai, salt/pepper shrimp, bison burgers, korean wings, ribs, shishito peppers....), and it was all delicious. We then as a table shared 3 or 4 steak entrees. Just fantastic! Get it medium or med rare. The best!!\\n\\nFor the critical feedback: our party got there about 615, as they don't take res (or at least not for a party as large as ours). We were hoping to eat early. At this time, we were given a 2-2.5 hour wait period. (The actual wait was 2.5 hrs.) Honestly in my opinion, this was ridiculous. We went to some bars in the area (Lucky's / Harpoon) and passed the time. I don't think BD has many seating options for parties our size, hence the wait I guess. And overall, I honestly was surprised just how small the place is given Ming's history/success in the area, but I won't pretend to know why it is so small.\\n\\nService was great, the girl who led waiting our table, and the team, was great. Excellent mood, friendly, helpful, etc.. \\n\\nAlso besides Ming, we saw Milan Lucic of the Boston Bruins who stopped in, and some members of the Sons of Anarchy (TV show) who were having dinner.\\n\\nNext time I go back, I won't go with as big a party."},{"name":"Menya Ramen","address":"331 W Bridge St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Love!

It came in a small to go container as I ordered to go from this restaurant. The place felt a bit too cold for me too, so would recommend asking to sit far from the door if possible. The baked salmon was a sushi role but we couldn't tell from the menu and that wasn't made clear to us either by the server, it was a bit too spicy but tasted good, again we were told it would be enough for 2 but it wasn't, the baked cauliflower with the basil sauce for $7 was not very saucy so that was also disappointing, we were hoping to avoid fried food but not worth the cost, the Jasmine rice was good. I would return but only go for drinks and sushi, the decor was nice. I would like to have tried their fried rice and noodle dishes to see how those compared, but the bitterness of the ginseng soup ruined all the other flavors for me, very disappointing, especially if expecting high quality soup, for the future will only go to Chang An around the corner for consistently good soup, at a much better price with larger portions."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"First - they have real yummy Indian food.

Last Saturday afternoon I stood in line for 15 minutes in a stifling crowd and finally got 2 cannoli: one Amaretto flavor which had perfectly delicious filling but also had a large empty air pocket in the center because it hadn't been filled properly. I also ordered one Limoncello flavor and I actually don't exactly know what it was filled with but it was definitely not the right thing! It had zero lemon flavor and looked and tasted like thick custard pie filling. The cannoli shells don't look or taste the same either.

The hostess then refused to seat us until all our party was there, even though she saw this person go into the restrooms.  Strange at best...  But we didn't make a fuss or anything.  We were shown to an oversized, cushy booth & given our menus.  The decor is nice and inviting, but it wasn't overly unique in anyway.\\n\\nMy group & I just missed happy hour (literally, by 2 minutes), so we took a seat inside and browsed our other options.  They had a specialty sushi roll that evening, which a friend tried & found to be about average.  I tried out the Chili Glazed Salmon salad and was pretty satisfied with it as a whole.  I was given the option as to how I wanted the salmon prepared, which was a nice change.  I stuck with the 'medium' option & it was in fact served around that exact level.  The salmon itself was a generous serving and had a texture that was just a tad bit firm and the glaze complimented it well.  The serving was big, but the majority of the bowl was definitely lettuce, followed by vegetables, and a few crispy wontons here & there.  It wasn't anything extraordinary & for a $13 price tag, I expected a bit more oomph to it.  Everyone else liked their meals just fine, but no one raved about anything, really.\\n\\nOur server was kind & attentive, but didn't hover which was nice.  She split our checks without hesitation & boxed up our remaining food quickly.  Honestly, she probably deserves 4 stars on her own.  And she let us linger for a bit while we finished up everything.  I never like being rushed to leave a place, so I found this impressive.\\n\\nParking here was awful, but I blame that more on the area than the restaurant.

Staff kept on rushing back and forth looking stressed out so I'm not sure if it was a typical Saturday night or not. Over 20 minutes later we asked the same hostess again about our reservation and she didn't even remember us. She had completely forgotten and took us to a table that had probably been ready for us that whole time. No apology or anything. Why couldn't she have taken us to our table at the beginning?\\n\\nIt was our first time here being out of town and it was nice sitting in the big room with the corner window. The decor is beautiful and we enjoyed the food. I'm thinking our next visit will earn 4 stars."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Cannolis made to order.

I was so excited about the new lavender and cardamom lattes, I even brought a friend in from out of town in to try this new heavenly concoction. All of my high hopes for a great latte and a little conversation were dashed by a very terse cashier, who informed us they were out of the syrups with the charm and warmth of the hair netted lunch line lady from high school. We left with our house coffee feeling judged. (that is a net loss of approx $4 to $6 plus tip if the owner is doing the math)  So today is a new day and I am a forgiving person, actually in truth I was driven by the sirens song of the lavender latte, so I gave it another try..... Strike two. As this cashier sized me up with disdain my mind immediately started to wonder through the pinterest pages of my mind, lavender syrup.. There it is. You see I can make my own lavender syrup at home and dust of the old espresso maker, cause if I want to enjoy a beautiful latte with that much attitude I can make it in my own kitchen and have a few surly teenagers judge me for free. I hope Posies will realize that coffee is a service industry, and I have been shopping in the neighbors 39 years, but with service like this their days are numbered. And just in case anyone else would like to enjoy a beautiful lavender latte without the nonsense, here is a recipe for a wonderful syrup http://peasepudding.wordpress.com/2009/12/29/lavender-syrup/ .

It's what made the crawfish, shrimp, potatoes, corn, sausage, and mushrooms taste so delicious when I recently visited for the first time. It was very busy on a Thursday evening around 8:00pm, but luckily for us, we found four seats pretty quickly.\\n\\nWe ordered a dozen oysters ($9.95), a pound of shrimp ($7.99), and 8 pounds of spicy crawfish ($7.95/lb), which also came with some corn, onions, potatoes, and mushrooms. For some reason, sausage seemed to be completely absent from our batch of crawfish. *sad panda* I'll give them the benefit of the doubt this time. Everything was butter-dripping tasty. We started having hallucinations of dipping all kinds of other edibles in the puddle of spicy butter at the bottom of the bag, like bread, French fries, more crawfish, etc.\\n\\nRandom observation: there are fishnets (actual ones, not the stockings) on every wall (including the restrooms) and fake plastic fish. Fun, cheesy times!\\n\\nThe verdict: I feel 30 pounds heavier than I did before I walked into the Crawfish Shack. Was it worth it?

Altogether, a very satisfying meal!\\n\\nFor people for complain about the service... it's typical Asian restaurant service. Expect to be ignored. Expect to wait if you're there between 7 and 9pm.

They have a small indoor bar and a large patio outside. The night was warm, but it was dark and breezy. There were eight of us around a table.\\n\\nFirst, we ordered drinks. The server was very nice, talkative and friendly. She was attentive and responsive. Then we ordered food. Some had appetizers, others ordered meals. I ordered my traditional burger, but this time with sweet potato fries. When they arrived, I will start by saying the fries were good. Unfortunately, I have a food allergy that absolutely sucks - I cannot have milk or milk products. So, I am always very careful to order so the wait staff knows. I told the waitress who told me their normal bun had milk in it and offered a substitution. That was great.\\n\\nWhen the meal arrived I started to enjoy my food until a few bites in when I realized there was cheese on the burger. When the waitress came by, I told her. Of course, as normally happens, she blamed the kitchen. She offered to call security or an ambulance but I know when it is serious and it did not seem to be so I declined, but asked them to replace the burger.\\n\\nIn a very short time, the manager came by and brought the replacement. He was kind but did not apologize. He did comp the burger. (If he did not, I would have really make a scene.) But, when something serious like that happens, I would expect more. A simple apology would have done nicely.\\n\\nOther than that big mistake, the rest was good.

To be clear, I am not complaining, as we obtained many friendly warnings that the food was running out, to include brisket.  The pulled pork was decent but not the best I've ever had.

So distracting.  I normally wouldn't have a conversation with someone who's playing with their phone.
