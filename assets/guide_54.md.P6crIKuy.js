I came here with after hearing a recommendation from a friend. I'm so glad I did, the owners, Sherry and Brandon, are such a sweet couple and I think they really bring something unique to Austin.\\n\\nSo from what I understand they move constantly but are always within Kitty Cohen's on Fridays. Don't miss your chance to try this place. Most places that label themselves as 'authentic' within Austin and specialize in meat based dishes, you can usually expect some either very tasty but albeit a tad on the greasy or fattening side. NOT Mama Kong! Sherry really brings the authentic taste of Cambodian food that is not just filling but also refreshing and more on the healthy side, so you don't have that feeling of regret.\\n\\nI really loved the Nyom Samat, it tasted like a seafood salad with hints of pork belly in it. Not being the most avid salad/veggie lover, I could still easily devour this as it had a really refreshing taste to it, but at the same time still being able to fill myself without that feeling of being over encumbered.  I also highly recommend the Somlar Kari if you want just a very tasty but light curry soup. This little soup had so much flavor it reminded me a bit of a bisque. All dishes come out fresh on arrival.\\n\\nThank you Sherry and Brandon for bringing something very unique to Austin.

The Union Oyster House is the perfect \\"more than halfway\\" stop for a snack, a meal, a break or an adult beverage.  So its location is key along the trail!  Take a break to digest all the history you have taken in and go to the Union Oyster House.  \\n\\nAnd to not pay respect to their chowder (which was delicious) or their wine (which was limited in options), but let me highlight their paper straw.  The world is changing and I believe in showing patronage to places that make an effort when it comes to the environment.  So while at the Union Oyster House, I was pleasantly surprised to see that even though I did not ask for a straw in my water it was provided (it would be better if they simply did not put one in there unless someone asks), when it did arrive with a straw, it was a paper one and not a plastic one. \\n\\nYou never know when location and a straw will be the deciding factor in a review, now do ya!"},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is so cute!

We arrived 30 minutes prior and had a very pleasant time at the bar. Eventually, we moved to our table and Dwayne, our server, greeted us promptly. I asked him for suggestions for a starter and they were spot on--the lobster fritters are delicious. We ordered our food--my wife the duck and the lamb ribs for me. Dwyane also suggested the acorn squash as a side--it was mind-blowingly good. Two fantastic suggestions from him. My wife's duck was amazing as well. Unfortunately, the lamb ribs were so burnt that the bones broke when I tried to separate them. Within five minutes of figuring this out, a manager asked how our meal was unprompted. I hate to complain but showed him the ribs and he said they never should have made it out of the kitchen. He asked me if I would like them to prepare the same thing or something other in it's place. I opted for the duck. He then said he would be taking both off our bill--above and beyond service. Dwyane continued to be a stellar server and apologize even though it most certainly was not his doing. We finished our meal, paid, and made sure to tip our server extra for his great service and the food that was removed from our bill.

It is the oldest continually operating restaurant in the country, and on a recent visit to Boston I decided to try it with a group of friends.  I made reservations days previously via Open Table and didn't have a problem getting in to the restaurant. \\n\\nI elected to use the valet parking described by the restaurant's web page. $14 is fairly good for parking in the area. The problem was I didn't find the valet. I pulled up to the restaurant at 5:30 and there wasn't a valet. I waited and waited...I called and the lady said someone should be out there - so I waited longer. Eventually I called back and she said oh, maybe he shows up at 6? My reservation was 5:30, and according to the web site, the valet would be available at the time. They do validate parking at a brick garage, but I didn't find that one.  I ended up paying $34 in a nearby parking deck.\\n\\nOnce inside, we were escorted upstairs (some fairly old, narrow wooden stairs). The dining area was charming and left like colonial times. The walls where puttied, little lamps at each table kept the place dim and cast a yellowish tint. Each time the dumbwaiter was used (when's the last time you saw one of those?), the lights flickered.\\n\\nWe each ordered diet cokes and reviewed the menu. When the drinks came, the napkin stuck to the glass like it often does and each of us did the customary action of shaking salt on the napkin. That blew at least three people's minds. Our waitress and two other staff members stopped and asked \\"what are you doing?\\". When we explained one useful think learned in high school chemistry class - salt on the napkin prevents the glass from sticking to said napkin, they were impressed. I thought everyone did that...\\n\\nOne friend ordered the mushroom ravioli with a side salad, another ordered the lobster ravioli with a salad, and my other friend & I ordered the grilled scallops. One puzzling thing she and I both noted is that while the menu read it came with green beans, it actually showed up with snow peas - which were good; just not what was on the menu.  The scallops were great and very filling. There was probably 10 of them in the plate, and for $26, not too bad. We did find it a little difficult to get drink refills. \\n\\nAfter dinner, three of us went for dessert - one had the Indian pudding (not nearly as good as the Wayside Inn), one had gingerbread (which she said was spectacular), and I had the apple cobbler (which was not that impressive).  For four of us, entrees, diet cokes and 3 desserts, the total was $147. \\n\\nI enjoyed the feel of the restaurant - the closeness of the tables and the lighting made conversation possible. I would also rate the food highly. My scallops and the surprising snow peas were great, and I did sneak one of the mushroom raviolis - very rich and creamy. The service on the other hand was just so-so, the valet was non-existent, and the deserts I would choose to find elsewhere. They were each $6-$7.50 for a small ramekin of product and really not worth it in size or quality. \\n\\nI would definitely come back. The history, atmosphere and food alone are worth coming for a visit. I can deal with the slow service and can skip dessert. Skip the bathroom too - it's located in the bar area and there isn't much room to wait without being in the way."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We stopped here on our way back to California.

It was pretty empty when I arrived and maybe that should have been my clue. It took a few tries to establish my precise order, but it was written down and repeated so all seemed good. And the descent started at that point. As a vegetarian I was surprised to see bacon liberally sprinkled over my food. Dish returned. Maybe that's what caused the next offering to be so bad - poorly cooked eggs and stone cold potatoes served on a frigid plate. It was a race against time to consume the eggs while they still retained some warmth - I failed - but the potatoes were a lost cause.\\n\\nIn a quaint display of customer sensitivity my server asked if I wanted a box for all the food I had left. Wow. No. I complained about the temperature of the food and, to be fair, she offered to bring me another plate - this would be my third - and I declined.

I simply asked the worker for recommendations and he rudely said \\" No! I don't do that , I never do that shit.\\" It made things extremely awkward and shocking that someone would employ someone that had no sense of professionalism or care for customer service. It was my first time there with my friends from out of state and it just ruined the experience . We all felt uncomfortable and rushed to leave even though there was barely any other customers. We came there on November 4, at 9:30pm. I tried calling multiple times and was hung up on. I want management to know that this worker is honestly a pathetic excuse of a cashier, he did not want to help us at all. I did not get his name but he was a white male with ear piercings, tattoos, grey shirt, and not to be mean but a missing ear lobe. I hope this will help the business employ better workers that actually seem like they want to work there. I have never in my life wrote a review but my experience with this worker was extremely rude and aggressively adamant about not wanting to help us and made it absolutely clear by saying so. That is why I felt the need to write this because I've never experienced such horrible customer service. I will definitely never come back to this establishment because obviously they don't know how to enforce proper customer service standards."},{"name":"The Oyster Bar","address":"1 Faneuil Hall Sq, Ste 200","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You feel hunger but your stomach won't tell you what it wants, you google \\"restaurants near me\\" and you stare at the list blankly, you bounce ideas of your girlfriend but can't agree on one place so you grab the half eaten bag of chips, a bowl of cereal and heat up the frost bitten garlic bread from in the freezer (no shame).  Picking a place to eat can be tough especially when you aren't craving something particular. It'd be nice top have tons of options of different cuisines, all under the same roof, about 535 feet long.....yup, we're talking Quincy Market.\\n\\nThe largest food hall in New England, the Quincy Market Food Colonnade is located at the Faneuil Hall Marketplace. This isn't the classic McDonald's, Panda Express, Sbarros food court (I'll still hit the chicken teriyaki from Panda Express). Not including the dining outside the food hall, there are over 30 different vendors slinging everything from clams to cupcakes, lobster rolls to lo mein, pizza to paninis, you get it. The second you step through the double doors, you're gonna smell some amazing stuff. Trudge your way through the hordes of bodies and you can window shop some great potential meals. We'll eventually hit them all, but today we are going to start with one of the few vendors that has its own seating, Walrus & The Carpenter Oyster Bar.\\n\\nWalrus and The Carpenter is a small sit down bar that sits about 10 people. If you see a stool open, grab it! You'll be grateful for the break from the madness that can be Quincy Market. Bartender was very nice and attentive. They've got some wine and a few beers on tap. I went with beer, an Irish Red (can't go wrong). Now for the big pick, food. Its a seafood place, product is fresh daily. The other patrons at the bar had all different picks and they all looked good. Decided to keep it classic New England and got a lobster roll, that big ole' sign nudged me in the right direction.\\n\\nThe lobster quality looked great, couldn't wait to get into it. Toasted bun? Yes please. A slight hiccup would have to be the portion. I've paid the same or less for some monster lobster rolls. Maybe I'm so 'Merica that I need a large portion of everything, but this seemed a bit puny. For what it lacked in size, made up for with substance. This roll had me thanking Poseidon for blessing the oceans with tasty lobsters. The lobster is cooked and seasoned perfectly. The bun was solid to hold it all but light at the same time, not soggy at all. Who doesn't love Cape Cod Potato Chips on the side? Nice bit of crunch between bites. Wash it all down with a beer, heaven.\\n\\nThe first stop in Quincy Market is a win. Walrus & The Carpenter Oyster Bar will give you a great taste of quality seafood in New England in a unique setting. Satisfying flavor will help you forgive the portion. Great excuse to walk five feet in any direction and get some dessert after your meal. Stop by and let me know what you think, I'll definitely be stopping in again."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I took my girlfriend's mother to dinner last night at Gracie's.

And frankly, the grub is so good it's worth a deviation from your diet du jour so long as you're not risking life or limb.\\n\\nThe place gets a one-star demerit for their excessively disorganized queue management - if you wander more than two feet from the door you get booted from the list, and the hosts are really terrible about underestimating your wait times. You can expect to wait up to two hours - no matter what the person at the door tells you. And, you can't make reservations, or ask them to text you when your table is ready.

She was clearly having a bad day (slamming cups down, unfriendly, unhappy), but definitely shouldn't have been on the registered as one of the only person guest interact with.\\n\\nOk with the negatives out of the way... let's get to the burgers, which matters most. We ordered a \\"junior\\" (single patty) hillbilly burger with pimento cheese, brisket chili and jalapenos... oh it was delicious. The fries were tasty and crispy. We also had an impossible burger (single patty) and to that I added pepper jack cheese and brisket chili. They chili is an amazing topping for these burgers, would recommend for sure. The impossible burger patty (available at many places nowadays) was almost indistinguishable from the standard beef burger... but with no meat! Incredible!\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries were probably a bit tastier than the normal fries, mostly because they were crispier, which is my preference. Overall, very tasty burgers, without being too greasy or messy. Interesting topping options and pre-selected burger options compared to basic burger spots.\\n\\nThe only other downside is that despite the large patio, dogs are only allowed outside the patio... aka 1-2 tables next to the parking lot, probably not a great place to bring your dog (thankfully we did not)."},{"name":"Zack's Pizza & Subs","address":"478 Columbian St","city":"South Weymouth","stars":"3","text":"Extremely unpleasant staff.

Sorry.  Pretty decent SIZED group of people :)  And I couldn't help but do a little comparison to the other tiny, farm to mouth style restaurant down the street, Barley Swine.  Maybe this was also because some of the folks that were with me for the BS fiasco (referred to by Mike C as the Bataan Death March)  were also with me for Lenoir.  I was soon to realize that these two restaurants, while similar in fundamentals like cooking up interesting foods with fresh local ingredients in an intimate setting,  were vastly different in execution and as such, Lenoir was a clear winner for me.  \\n\\nFirst of all, Lenoir TAKES RESERVATIONS.  In fact, I think that's the only way to get in and at this time you have to make them a good week out.  Course, once they catch on you'll have to plan even farther ahead.  I admit I got a little nervous of a repeat BS experience when they pushed our reservation time back 30 minutes because the folks before us were late, but as I mentioned in that BS review, I don't mind waiting with great company and the owner graciously comped us a bottle of wine as well.  The other great thing about a reservation for a party this size (9 of us), we were relegated to the communal table and offered a chance to have our apps and our desserts family style.  So instead of each person choosing one of each, they brought out two choices of apps and two choices of desserts for everyone to sample.\\n\\nSecondly, Lenoir is serving up some great food in big enough portions that you won't have to hit Taco Smell on your way home.  And while they are using interesting ingredients here, they are not resorting to the very fashionable dressing up of offal like BS is doing.  Nope.  No tongue and cheek here (literally).  We started out with both the brussel sprouts and \\"melted\\" carrots on polenta and the chickpea panisse with the poached egg on top and greens underneath.  Both were really good and creative and generous in portion.  For my entree, I had to have the axis venison as it came so highly recommended.  It surprised me by being presented almost like a pho, in a broth with noodles and sprouts.  While tasty, I was surprised to find that I actually loved my hubby's dish even more.  He got the chicken with lettuce and peanuts (again the accessories had the Asian flare of being served on the side like a pho).  His chicken was also covered in what can best be described as \\"threads\\" of sweet potato, so small and so fine but still lending a sweetness to the dish.  For a guy on a strict diet, he was extremely pleased to find something on the menu not only that he can eat, but that is similar but soooo much better than what we are eating at home right now.  Our desserts were a coconut cake and the cheese plate.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I do have a, um, cheese tooth so I gravitated to that.  The fiore sardo cheese was very similar to parmesan, finely shaved and paired fantastically with the candied oranges and the marcona almonds.\\n\\nOne last difference.  The ambiance.  I remember BS being somewhat sparse and simple, which is fine.  But Lenoir is warm and beautifully decorated with recycled wood pieces or old frames all creatively placed.  The linens hanging in front of the windows gave it almost a secretive feel, like being in a childhood fort.  And the communal table in the middle of the restaurant was a great way to share that secret with friends.  I would say this place holds 40 diners tops (we actually counted) so it is very intimate.  The owner herself took our coats and umbrellas and our waiter was very efficient and made great wine recommendations (get the sparkling pinot!!). \\n\\nI would definitely return here, esp since they change the menu according to seasonal availability of local foods.  So yeah, maybe I should call right now to reserve a table in the spring.  Once people discover this place,  you'll wish you had as well.\\n\\nJust a note:  they have raised their 3 course meal price from $30 to $35.  Still a deal if you ask me and probably as much or less than you would pay for half the food at BS."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"SOUP SZN IS HERE.

What can I say about a place that has 4.5 stars with 2,000+ reviews? This place is nestled away in the outskirts of metro Atlanta and is wonderfully rated by multiple internet review sites. We had to check it out during our long weekend vacation. We get there right as the place opens and get our pick of the litter when it comes to outdoor seating. We have a great view of some nice looking apartment complexes, a fun looking dog park, and the downtown buildings far away. \\n\\nLooking at the menu for this place, we were incredibly overwhelmed. There were so many deliciously unique dishes here that it almost wasn't fair. And their specials list wasn't helping anything. After quite a few agonizing moments, we end up deciding to split three of their apps and one of their entrees. \\n\\nLet's start with the apps, the special. I don't 100% remember it, and it's not listed anywhere, but I do remember that it was krab meat, I think duck, and some veggies in a sandwich where the bun was a fried bao bun cut in half. So good. The bun was fluffy and absorbed the sauce of the meat, which was teriyaki-like. The meats were tender and fall-apart. So good. I think they ran out of this special in a couple of hours. \\n\\nWe also got the Fried Calamari (aioli, pineapple dipping sauce). It was fried to perfection and had shishito peppers also fried with it. The tang from the peppers matched super well with the sweet, pineapple dipping sauce. The calamari's breading was thin and crispy and delicious. A star app. \\n\\nThe last thing we got was the winner of the night, the Lobster Wontons (cream cheese, caviar, mango glaze, truffle balsamic). These things were so, so good. They were fried, but they were not greasy. The lobster filling was strong, but not overwhelming. The flavor infused itself into the cream cheese so it was like it was everywhere. The sweet mango glaze and the crispy wonton shell set this thing off. So good. I wish we had ordered four orders of it. \\n\\nNow for the entree. After much careful deliberation, we chose the Pad Thai Salmon (cornmeal battered, eggs, ground peanuts, fresh vegetables, sweet chili parmesan). I have never had salmon like this. It was crispy on the outside, almost with a crust of cornbread, and yet it was moist and flakey inside. Holy moly. \\n\\nThe eggs and the peanuts and the veggies were all cooked very well and made this dish wonderful. We knew we had chosen correctly. That was, until we actually saw someone order the Lobster Fried Rice. I usually avoid lobster entrees, because they're kind of gimmicky, but we saw this thing and were like, wow. Think carefully. That's the moral of the story here. Like I said, the menu isn't fair. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had an order of the Empanadas. They were very berry-themed and they had some cinnamon ice cream. Very good. Not the highlight of the night, but a great way to end. \\n\\nOverall, this was a perfect dinner. It is very highly reviewed for a reason. I recommend coming here. I almost went back the following night to try all the foods we wanted to not miss out on. Live it up while you're here.

This is going to be a long one...\\n\\nWe had reservations at 5 pm on Sunday to celebrate my birthday. We arrived right on time but as they had not yet opened their dining room for dinner yet, we had to wait about 10 minutes.\\n\\nWe were seated at the table immediately on the other side of the waiting area wall, right at the entrance to the dining room - which did not bode well for the enjoyment of our meal. I looked longingly at the many other tables that were empty this early in the evening and thought about asking for another table but figured maybe they had lots of reservations for larger parties. This is a busy, popular place, and there were only 2 of us, after all. \\n\\nSo here is what we ordered:\\n\\nJAM√ìN SERRANO\\nPICADILLO ACEBICHADO\\nAHUMADOS DE MAR Y R√çO\\nPALTA RELLENA DE CANGREJO\\nCONCHAS A LA PARRILLA\\nCANUTOS DE QUINUA Y MARACUY√Å\\nTRUFAS PERUANAS (CUSCO & LORETO)\\n\\n- \\n\\nEverything was decent and nothing was extraordinary, neither in presentation nor taste. I have had far better, far less expensive meals at many other places in Portland and have also had far better, far less expensive tapas back east. Perhaps their entrees are the way to go since some of their tapas leave a lot to be desired.  Perhaps we just chose poorly.\\n\\nHere is where my real complaint lies:\\n\\nSince we were seated early, our table was not initially that big of an issue. However, as time went on, the restaurant got busier, and the traffic past our table increased. The walkway, which was between our table and the one next to us, was maybe 18 inches wide and that is being generous. There was so little room to get through that there were times when people actually had to lean over our table, and thus over our food, as they walked by. \\n\\nOne blonde female server in particular did this more than once and at one point actually slammed into my chair so hard that she moved it (and me, of course) several inches away from the table. I turned to look at her but she continued on, seemingly completely oblivious.  I am not sure how she could have been though, she hit my chair THAT hard.  How could she not notice?  No excuse me, no I'm sorry, nothing.  I'm a little person and I was smushed up against the wall as much as I possibly could be. This was just one of many bumps and jostles I received throughout the evening from both patrons and servers alike. That was just unacceptable for the amount of money we were paying to dine here. \\n\\nThe only redeeming quality about our experience was the service we received. I wish I could remember our server's name. She was very sweet, attentive, and friendly.  She had an extra little treat sent out to us in addition to our original dessert order. I am not sure why she did that...maybe she could tell that we did not really enjoy ourselves. Whatever her reasons, it was appreciated, given the overall poor experience we had. \\n\\nI have been wanting to eat here for so long, and was so excited to use my birthday as an excuse to come here for dinner. It was just not worth it at all.\\n\\nI also noticed, with some distaste, that there were 3 tables (which seated 4) that remained empty throughout the 2 hours we spent here at the worst table in the place.  I do not think it's that unheard of to seat a party of 2 at a table for 4. If those who run this place ever read these things, I would suggest relocating that table or removing it altogether. I do not see how anyone could enjoy a meal while sitting there.

But the combination of flavors and toppings is so fun.\\n\\nSpicy tuna tacos - Brilliant idea to fill a taco-shaped wonton with a sushi-like filling. It's not super spicy and more of an uncooked texture, but great as an appetizer while hungrily waiting for our ramen. \\n\\nSpicy chicken ramen - This dish alone is a reason to come here, even if you've been here before and eaten something else. There's something about the pairings of the spinach and bean sprouts that come in it, the flavor of the broth, and the thin noodles (and how perfectly they're cooked). \\n\\nSpicy creamy vegan - I find there was a strange mixings of different flavors that go into this bowl, but it does work quite well. A little salty for my taste but definitely not lacking flavor. I wasn't the biggest fan of the toppings offered as they felt like all the little items you sprinkle on top and not many things of much substance, but there are a few opportunities for substitutions within reason and I certainly took advantage.\\n\\nToppings - I love that there are so many options! They're actually great for sharing or having just a taste/try because each order comes in a separate bowl (also making the cost much more justifiable). Special shoutout to the bamboo shoots, though I've seen a number of vegetables go by that I want to try. \\n\\nSpecifics - Tofu is great in any option, though I do find it a little bland to just have the (slimy) plain boiled cubes. The bamboo shoots have this cool smoky flavor and they're huge, not tiny flavorless sticks. The chicken chashu mixes in well but keep in mind it's a ground meat so it kind of disappears into the soup. The majority of vegetables are pretty simple (like mushrooms) but definitely make a statement in your dish.\\n\\n\\nService: Tons of waiters bustling around, but each one is super friendly and knows how to talk ramen (or sake, or whatever you're into). \\n\\nAtmosphere: It's way too small in here and they know it. I don't know what they can do to get more space other than open up a new location! It is comfortable inside, just difficult to get your ideal seating because you just get whatever table is available.\\n\\nParking: The lot gets crazy with all the restaurants in the strip, but there are multiple lots in the area that [I think] are available for Jinya customers.

While the flavor was great, I find the broth to be too thick, heavy, and oily for my taste. Coupled with the usual long wait time, I've not returned until tonight. \\n\\nWe were craving for a bowl of steaming hot ramen on this freezing night.....we were not too thrilled about the anticipated long wait. To our (pleasant) surprise, the wait wasn't long.....(Everything is relative. We waited for about 30 minutes at 7:00 PM on a Saturday, compared to the usual 1 hour wait time). \\n\\nWe ordered the two new items; the spicy diced chashu and Tokyo tonkatsu. I love the Tokyo tonkatsu - The broth is thick and has depth of flavors. The noodle has the perfect chewiness, and the egg was perfectly cooked (egg yolk was still soft but not runny....yummmm!!). I would rate this among my top 3 ramens in Atlanta. Wife's spicy ramen was not too shabby as well. Many other ramen places would sprinkler chilli oil/powder in regular broth to make it spicy, but not here. The spiciness is blended well with other flavor of the broth. We finished the meal with one of the best panna cotta we've had. Well, technically speaking, its consistency is somewhere between panna cotta and custard. The dessert is not too sweet and is refreshing - a great counter to the thick and heavy broth.\\n\\nBased on tonight's meal, it deserves a five star review. Yes! we will keep coming back for the delicious ramens,"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Make reservations, other wise food & portion  outstanding and I can eat.

I went twice in their first 3 weeks of opening and greatly enjoyed it!\\n\\nTownsman is located in the (rapidly gentrifying) hinterland between Chinatown and South Station, in what appears to be a swanky new luxury residential building.  Upon entering, there is a lounge area on the left and a bar on the right, perfect for meeting with friends for drinks, although you might be in the way if you're unable to snag a seat. \\n\\nThe dining room itself is modern and simple, boisterous and maybe a little brightly lit for my liking, but service is friendly and attentive.  The servers clearly have fun and the energy level is high. The GM/Sommelier Meredith is warm, charming, and does a great job understanding what you're looking for with wine before offering a suggestion.  I've enjoyed both bottles she's recommended.\\n\\nThe food was locally sourced and executed to perfection both times I went.  Among the starters, the charred baby octopus was phenomenal and the mussels were great and served with a large piece of bread that's perfect for finishing off the broth.  During my first visit, the server and other patrons sitting nearby recommended the Amish farm hen.  After trying it, I can imagine that it will become their signature dish.  On a future visit I'd love to try the lamb saddle or duck, but the chicken is so well presented, with amazing flavor and without the dryness that plagues the chicken at other places.\\n\\nThe wine list is diverse with options that were mostly French, and they have a nice selection of cocktails as well.\\n\\nOverall, while very new, this place truly lived up to the hype, and they seem to have transitioned seamlessly to the new location in Boston.

About 3 pounds and 2 gallons worth.  I was hoping an Oompa Loompa would roll me out to the juicing room when I was done.  It was painfully delicious!  \\n\\nMy main reason for going, other than the good reviews, was to check out HH as I didn't see any comments on that yet.  Eh, it's ok.  A buck off all drinks, 4-7.  The drinks are pricey but chock full of unusual flavors and freshly made, so it's understandable.  Had a melon drink with fresh melon juice and prosciutto (sweet and a little too salty for me near the end), a cherry ginger limeade (nice and sweet), and (my fave) the grapefruit basil drink which should replace Mimosas for breakfast everywhere!  Unfortunately, despite the kaleidoscope of flavors, one hour and 3 drinks later, no buzz.  They could pack more booze in there I think.\\n\\nThe food was outstanding.  Actually I should say the SIDES are outstanding!  We started with the waffle fry nachos which were sufficiently covered in refrieds and cheese and sour cream and heartattackness.  Hubby and I each got a different dog, his porked and mine, the Texalina, with cole slaw on it.  My only beef (ha pun) with the place is that these monster dogs come out in little paper trays.  My dog had a french bread bun that was huge!  And there was no way I could get all that messy goodness in my mouth, so I had to use knife and fork.  I couldn't cut my stuff without it all spilling out the tray and I couldn't get a legitimate bite of all the flavors together.  A little dog, then a little bun, then a scoop of cole slaw.  It was unwieldy at best.  Or maybe I'm just too much of a p***y to eat here.  These dogs are for bold eaters!  \\n\\nBut the sides!  Oh. Goodness. Revealed.  The corn cup was an explosion of flavor with sweet corn, lime, chile and cilantro.  And the broccoli salad we got to \\"balance out\\" the unhealthy food, was the best dish of the nite, with fresh broc, onion, almonds, and bacon (ps, also unwieldy to cut broccoli trees in a tiny cup).\\n\\nJust a side note.  I loved the honkey tonk music playing too!  Daddy raised me on Waylon, Willie and the boys and it really took me back.

Delicious and simple, yet the flavor palette coming from this thing is off the charts. \\n\\nPotato Cakes with Crab Salad? Surprisingly light and delicious, and the mixtures of celery, ginger, garlic and mixed seafood made this appetizer well worth the starter. \\n\\nThe Aj√≠ De Gallina was fantastic right to the very end.

As classic as Peruvian it can be. \\n\\nThe Rotating Trio of Creme Brulee is something that I highly suggest a group or two grab. It's totally worth experimenting the different flavors from toasted caramel to paprika to something incredibly surprising! How can you say no to three rich and delectable desserts? \\n\\nThe food at Andina has impressed us, and their passion for making authentic Peruvian food has been incredibly successful.

I appreciate the amuse-bouche sponsored by a Florida beach community that's putting BP's settlement money to good use, but the quality of the rest of the meal just didn't quite hit the mark. I started with oysters on the half shell, choosing Gulf coast, West Coast, and East coast varieties. The oysters from the left coast were smaller, but with a really good brine and flavor. The much-maligned Blue Points were meaty, but slightly bland. And the Gulf Coast oysters? BP should have paid for those too. It was like eating nothing at all. Thank goodness for the horseradish and cocktail sauce or I might have just left them on the plate. \\n\\nFor dinner I had the cedar plank salmon. It was cooked perfectly and every bite was moist. So why not 4 stars? The oysters set the tone and the lackluster wine list sealed the deal. By the time the entree arrived, they'd already lost a star.

Warm, good flavor, nice texture.\\n\\nWe decided to split a couple of the entrees and that is where the party stopped.  The lobster was ok but honestly pretty bland.  It melted in your mouth which is good but it was a very small portion and just not seasoned well.  We also tried the Ossobuco and it wasn't as tender as everyone would have hoped.  It didn't fall off the bone and it was pretty \\"chewy\\" which was disappointing.  The root veggies served with it were okay but not cooked through and tasted like the dirt they were rooted in.  The grits were good and although pesto was mentioned on the menu, didn't get a hint of that from any bite I took.\\n\\nSo we had a couple highs and a couple lows during our dining experience.  The service was pretty spotty and that was a little annoying but as annoying as some of that could have been, all was redeemed when we tried dessert.  At the server's recommendation we tried the sticky toffee pudding.  It was a game changer.  It was very good.  They should call it sticky toffee BREAD pudding because that was the consistency to be honest.  It was very sweet and rich but the PERFECT sweet complete.  It could have been served with some type of unique gelato to balance the sweetness but overall it was quite tasty and one of their signature items.  \\n\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my time here.  Would I come back?  Maybe.  They aren't cheap and the service/atmosphere is nothing super special.  I would go there to start my evening with a couple of small plates/sides and then maybe head elsewhere for the main meal.  Don't judge me, but I may come back again for the dessert!

Very sweet. Finally the chicken. Moist and well seasoned, very flavorful. It was hard to eat with a knife and fork as it was a thigh and drumstick.

The chowder was not thick first off yet not too soupy and you were able to taste all the ingredients again with the creamy broth just blending it all together. There was just enough meat, potatoes and clam meat that complemented the tasty broth. It was so good, you didn't even need crackers to supplement the taste cause I was too afraid to ruin this delicious dish!\\n\\nThe oysters were thick and meaty. Had that taste of the ocean which was great but not too overpowering which was great. The lemon just brought out that flavor that made you want to just eat more and more because it had that effect. My girl definitely enjoyed them. A bit pricey but it was definitely worth every penny spent.\\n\\nThe Newburg Seafood was my main entree. The amount of rice and seafood that they gave you was perfect! not too much of either. The sauce melted into the rice and the seafood that included lobster, shrimp, and scallops, made the dish overall work well together. The newburg was a bit heavy but overall a very delicious plate!

The turkey Bree sandwich was nice but goes better with the soup. Without the soup it lacks a little flavor.

So we decided to call for reservations. I called multiple times but couldn't get through. My bf calls on his phone and it goes through but the hostess said there were no reservations for a party of 2. I look through the Yelp reviews and other people had made reservations for their anniversary and had no problems. We decided to check out their website and they had OpenTable Reservations on there so we made our reservations through there...no problem. So I'm wondering why the hostess said there were no reservations for a party of 2. \\n\\nWe actually arrive an hour early and they said they weren't able to accommodate us until our reservation time. But they directed us to the bar side that had available seating. We requested for a booth but was denied. They said the booth was for bigger parties of more than 2. I told the hostess it was our anniversary and there was no one in line and they had 4 tables open. He said that was the \\"rules\\". At this point, we're pretty irritated and didn't want to be seated in the regular tables that are super close to the other tables. Literally there is no space in between the tables and we were looking for a more intimate dinner for our anniversary. \\n\\nSo we decided to go to the bars and wait until our reservation time. We arrive at our reservation time. We requested the booth in the dining side and they were ok with it since it was pretty late now and there was no one there. We were handed the menu and we ordered our drinks. \\n\\nWe got the Pineapple mojito and the ahumado de pepinillo. The mojito had a weird taste to it. It did not taste refreshing like a regular mojito. And it didn't taste like pineapple...more like a thick syrup with old mangos. The ahumado on the other hand was very good. It was a bit spicy but the sweet rims and the citrus flavor balanced out everything. \\n\\nNext we ordered the tapas to share and a entree (but we ended up cancelling the entree because we got too full) \\nceviche de pescado ($20)- Basically fish ceviche that was very sour and doesn't come with plantain chips or anything to eat it with. So eating ceviche straight up was too much for me. Would have been great if paired with something to balance out the sourness. \\nconchas a la parrila ($14)- scallops with string onions rings. It had an acquire taste to it...not sure what it was but it was a bit too heavy for me. I couldn't enjoy the soft scallops because if the smell. \\ncausas morada ($10.5)- purple potato and shredded chicken breast. Very cold dish! The purple potato just tasted like cold potato and the chicken breast tasted like chicken breast from a can. \\ncarne empanadas (12.50)- beef meat pies...this was probably the worst! It was sour! And tasted like throw up. \\nanticuchos de pulpo ($14)- grilled octopus with chimichurri. This was probably the best dish. The octopus was not chewy but very tender. It was very light and refreshing. \\nrellenos palta rellena de cangrejo ($14.5)- avocado stuffed with crab was super generic. The crab was really cold. It just tasted like regular crab with avocado. \\n\\nNothing really stood out to me and everything was mediocre. Trying to get reservations was a pain and the hostesses weren't very helpful or nice. Too many \\"rules\\" to follow....and not accommodating of the guests. Our server was nice but it seemed like she was tired since we were one of her last customers. She did have a positive attitude though and accommodated our needs. I just wish the food tasted was better!

On my slice the cheese was on one side and the sauce was on the other with basil on the top so it seems like it was made so in order to get the best bites you had to fold it in half. The bottom was very crispy which I always like in a pizza (no soggy bottoms here!).\\n\\nNote that they only serve slices daily until 6:30pm and from 9:30pm to close!"},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great German beer selection and a really fun menu.

The non-foodies are getting hangry.\\n\\n[Time & Date of visit]: Opening day, 11:45 lunch time\\n\\n[Location/Ambiance]:\\nLocation - The map marker was a bit off, hopefully my edits go through. It's located in the corner right next to D Geller & Son, so follow the signs for that if you get a little lost.\\n\\nParking - The busy plaza could have better pathways / more visible stop signs. Plenty of parking in the lot even at prime time lunch hour. The front parking spaces right in front of Jinya are reserved for D Geller & Son though. \\n\\nInside - Reminiscent of LA ramen spots, I believe they brought over the designs similar to their other shops. Just in case the counter area is a bit cramp for you, opt for the patio section with shade. \\n\\n[Service]: \\n\\nOur server was very accommodating as we transition from the single counter space to the patio. Usually I ask for food recommendations and see if they are just trying to push for a sale on the high price items. Or if they are on the level and actually and provide honest feedback on what food items they liked. I'm thankful that she chose the latter. The pork belly bao was spot on just as she explained it. Though it was still opening week and they are working out the kinks, the food came out in a timely manner. Water refills could be checked on a bit more, but I believe they didn't expect a huge lunch crowd. Hopefully they continue to improve.\\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\n\\nBrussel Sprouts Tempura - The batter was a good amount without being doughy and cooked well for a slight crunchy texture without being overly greasy / oily. The bigger pieces were not cooked all the way, so expect some more aggressive chewing. It's worth a try, but I hope that they get the size portions consistent. \\n\\nJinya Bun - Pork Belly at it's finest. I think honestly, this could give Ah Ma's version a run for it's money. All the meats, not much of the fat, and OMG it's so tender that Karly G was able to cut it with the toothpick to split between us. Not kidding. MUST TRY. \\n\\nJinya Tonkotsu Black - I'm not the biggest ramen fanatic, but this.... was spot on. The broth was hearty. The noodles cooked al dente. The pork was oh so buttery. The only thing I would add would pay for extra meet. \\n\\nThe Cha Cha Cha - Included with this bowl, is a jar of garlic and a garlic press brought out tableside. Yeah, it's a bit more work but freshly pressed garlic needs to be eaten right then and there. I would have to say, the spiciness level is more \\"American\\" vs \\"Asian\\" from a spoonful of broth that I tried. I believe Karly enjoyed it though. \\n\\n[Total Bill w/ Tip & Tax]:\\nThe ramen is a bit more expensive, ranging from $10-12 before adding toppings. But I think it was great as is. Unless you really really have to add more to it just because, expect a higher bill. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nI think Jinya, even though it is a chain, is a very welcome and much needed ramen spot to ATL. Umaido has been less than impressive, and the emptiness inside shows. While other Japanese fare restaurants just have it on the menu, it's not the featured item per se. I think that Jinya deserves 5 stars and hope that they continue to provide this level of quality."},{"name":"Carlita's","address":"1101 NW Northrup St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We came here on the first day it opened to the public.

They didn't. They did make the entree they hadn't given me, but that is all. So...we had one warm entree and one cold and soggy entree. Not great, guys.

New to the area, I was really happy to find a good ramen place in Harvard Square. My husband and I came here on a Tuesday night around 8, and had to wait about 15 minutes. The vibe of this place is modern, trendy, and super casual all at the same time. \\n\\nI got the miso ramen, and my husband got the spicy miso ramen. Mine was awesome, and he said his spice level was just right. I like that you can get it in 3 different sizes. I had enough to bring home for a second meal.

Well, it was. Yes, it was safe. Yes, the food got here. Yes, it arrived in a very reasonable amount of time. Is it hot? No. Is it plentiful? No. But it's here.\\n\\nIt does the trick, but just be aware that in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants, it's not the best bang for your buck. I'll probably reconsider before ordering here again unless I'm desperate for delivery since the food was still good. Without the broth thing, I would have considered a third or fourth star, but since they're being stingy with me, I'll be stingy back."},{"name":"Alchemy Caf√©","address":"625 Parsons Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"At first I wasn't going to leave a review on this place at all. It didn't have enough stuff I really liked. I would look at the menu and have the hardest time figuring out what I wanted and sometimes just passed on items. I'm a protein guy and I love meat. So the menu just didn't do it for me.\\n\\nBut passing by this place so frequently becuase it's right under the fitness loft, it's hard to ignore. Especially if you are hungry right after a workout. So needless to say I have ate here a lot more. So now the background is over let's get to the real review.\\n\\nThere is nothing this place does wrong. And it does everything right. Everything I've gotten had been pretty good. They mix healthy and clean with a nice taste. My favorite is the Portobello sandwich. It just does it for me. I forget that there is no meat on there. It gives good taste without giving out a guilty feeling of eating something bad, Because you aren't. I love the strawberry Avocado toast as well, as seen in my pictures. The tartness of the strawberry's and the sweetness of the little bit of honey drizzle is really good. But they offer so much more that Are solid as well, like bowls, juices, shakes and more. I haven't had something I didn't like here yet. I get the juices from time to time. They are really refreshing.\\n\\nThey also do a very good job of presenting their food. I mean you almost have to in this day and age because of social media and even platforms like yelp. But everything is dressed for success here. They make healthy just look good. That's plain and simple. Scroll through the pics of the place and you can see for yourself.\\n\\nEverything is always served in a timely manner and the employees are always friendly. So there's never a problem with customer service. So you won't have to worry about that.\\n\\nThe thing I like most is because (as mentioned before) it's placed right under the fitness loft, so it's easy to get some clean nutrients after a workout when your body is craving them the most. I know when I'm done working out my body is drained. And it only wants one thing... food.... and what is conveniently placed below my gym?...... exxxactly. It makes it so easy to grab a bite and just go home. No need to hit Krogers or warm up this weeks meal prep. \\n\\nThe place is nice and clean inside. You will never find it dirty. It has lots of tables and chairs for gathering with friends or reading books, getting work done or whatever you want to do. It's flooded with natural light, which I like the best, because it has two big windows on both sides. It's a nice little hip place to chill and eat and do whatever you want.\\n\\n\\nI'd recommend this place to anyone,l. Keep in mind. Im basically 99 percent carnivore LOL. And the menu does not have a lot of meat options. So it's still hard for me to find something to try. But when I do it's always a \\"glad I tried that\\". So anyone like me, be prepared to struggle on what you want on the menu. But when you find something, you will like it. This place just doesn't do anything bad, plus the convenience, plus the cleanliness, plus the atmosphere, plus how fresh the food is, it can't be be beat. I have to give 5 stars, (even though I might find the menu hard to adapt to)Because they take what they offer and do it exceptionally well. Which is what every restaurant or store strives to do, even when what they offer isn't for everyone. And I have to respect that. I'll end this off with the only negative.... things can kind of be pricey. But if you get over that, everything is good."},{"name":"Mortadella Head","address":"20 College Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious food, consistently served by friendly staff.

The first time I got the steak, it was huge portion with lots of flavor. The chicken was not so great. It was very dry so I ended up just sharing the steak dish. The 2nd time was a bit of a disappointment. The steak was about half the size of what I ordered last time. Now this could have been a different cut of steak, but the flavor was nowhere near as good as the first time. But any restaurant is going to have its ups and downs I suppose. I hope it does well!\\n\\nMake sure to make an reservation before going. The place has a cool set up and is definitely worth trying at least once. But be warned, their floors are sticky.

I then asked the server if she can tell the bartender to go more towards the sour side, and she gave me this awkward look. Well, when my second martini came, it was still made exactly just like the first one. *sigh*\\n\\nI had the pad thai with tofu and although I must admit that I was not too thrilled with it when it first came out, I sure changed my mind once I dug into it. There was PLENTY of tofu and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The thing that kind of threw me off is that it was a bit too soupy. Anyway, I couldnt finish the whole dish at $11 for the dinner plate so I took half of it home. I left the soupy part behind and left it dry for me to take home and it still tasted pretty good for the second round. \\n\\nI had a chance to taste my friend's General Tso's chicken and that was great as well. \\n\\nThe server was nice and sweet but lackluster. Our server, at the end, while she was handing our bill, accidentally dipped the folder in one of my friend's food that she was still working on. Im not sure if the server saw it at the moment, but my friend made a comment about that and the server did not even acknowledge what just happened. \\n\\nAnyway, I recommend the pad thai (although it doesnt look to appetizing at first, it actually tastes very good.) and the general tso was also pretty good."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite brunch spots.

It reminded me of a place we used to have here in Miami, the Miami City Club. The place has windows going all around the building. You get a view of everything you could ever want to see in Boston. As tourists, this kind of view was a must-do for our trip. This alone is deserving of 5 stars, and the live jazz musicians really added that something extra to the experience. \\n\\nMy only complaint is with Top of the Hub as a restaurant/lounge. We ended up better off than we would have been a few floors down at the Skywalk Observatory. The tickets for that viewing were around $10-15, I think. We took a peek, and saw they didn't have any kind of seating, so you're just walking around the indoor observatory until you're tired of the sights. The benefit of Top of the Hub was that we could sit at a table by the window, have a drink, listen to live music, and see the sights at our leisure. So, back to my complaint.....our drinks were gross. My $15 \\"chocolate\\" martini was so strong that I had our waiter make it again, and it was still like drinking lighter fluid. Service was friendly, but incredibly slow. For the first 15-20 minutes of being there, no one approached us. We finally had to get up and find someone to come take our drink orders. FYI, the other reviews made it seem like you needed a minimum order to sit at a table, but they didn't give us any problems. We were there in the early weekend afternoon and each ordered a drink, and they had us at a table by the window. \\n\\nI'd normally take away more stars for bad, expensive drinks and poor service, but the views really do make up for it, and for around the same price, it's a better experience that going to the Observatory."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Never had Ramen before, and was a bit skeptical.

As a Southerner, I've gotten my fill of artery clogging Sunday cuisine, and let me tell you, Mary Macs is just about some of the best restaurant down-home food I've had. YUM. \\n\\nMini Corn muffin + pot liquor  -As first-timers, me and the sig got to a comp taste of Mary's mini corn muffins and pot liquor, and with a dash or two of their homemade pepper sauce this stuff is to die for. Spicy, salty, briny, yummy.\\n\\nFried Green Tomatoes - Comes with a white white dipping sauce (tastes like a sour cream base with maybe horseradish) crispy on the outside, tender in the inside. Great!\\n\\nAssortments of Breads - biscuits, mini corn muffin, cinnamon roll - Their bread is just amazing. The biscuits taste like home. the corn muffins are just the right texture and moist, the cinnamon rolls are delicious and would make a great partner with some tea or coffee in the morning.\\n\\nLemonade+Sweet Tea - OH LAWD...I spent quite a few years in Baltimore, and we called this mixture a 'half and half'. In any event, this stuff is amazing. They make their own lemonade, and the combination is just the right amount of country-sweet, and a little tangy.\\n\\nPot Roast - Comfort food at its finest. Comes in a bowl with roasted carrots and potatoes. Kinda like a pot pie, minus the breading. SO good, and the gravy that holds the whole thing together? BABY, lemme tell you: I need that stuff at all meals moving forward.\\n\\nMeat Loaf - Tender, moist with an awesome ketchup-based sauce on top. Loved it.\\n\\nSweet Potato Souffle - Tastes just like a really, REALLY good sweet potato pie, minus the crust, plus melted marshmallows. A southern staple, done oh, so right.\\n\\nCollard Greens - Add a little of that pepper sauce I was telling you about, crumble the corn muffin, mix, devour. *mmm*\\n\\nBlackened Trout - SOOO good. As a healthy alternative, you have got to try this. Squeeze a little lemon over the top, and its gooood eats.\\n\\nStrawberry Shortcake - Dense, not too sweet pound cake with fresh whipped cream and strawberries. I got bullied into this (i wanted to try the peanut butter pie) but I was pleasantly surprised. it was very good. Not too sweet.\\n\\nMeh: Cabbage didnt look so hot, the sig exchanged it for the sweet potato souffle which subsequently was inhaled. \\n\\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants some traditional, well-seasoned southern food in a quaint environment.

I usually go for on the of prebuilt burgers, the namesake option. It's a really basic double stacked burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion, and their signature burger sauce. I found this sauce pretty good, actually more than Farmburger's equivalent. Compared to similar chains, the burgers here easily score a  stars.

You wait in a line to order up in the front, which during busy nights takes forever. I was a tad fed up with how long things were taking. The line was well outside the door yet there was only one single cashier. I'm not sure if management realizes this and the fact many of us were waiting well beyond 20 minutes outside in the heat.

Complex items \\"eggs and croissant\\" looked to take about 30 minutes.. yikes.\\n\\nI stood at the counter, 2nd person in line for about 15 minutes before I was attended to, and I informed them that someone else was in front of me!  The ENTIRE establishment (employees and patrons) looked at me like I had 2 heads!! With service SOOO bad, how could I possibly allow someone to go ahead of me?  Well, because I am and American, a gentleman and I know the difference between right and wrong.\\n\\nSo after another 5 minutes... I ordered the MINIMAL to get out of there... cheese bread: a bit oversized but properly done and tasty; a sweet empenada of cheese and guava, it was okay; and a cafe latte and an cappuccino. Both coffee drinks were sooo mild, I would call them bland, but the milk was steamed to the proper temperature and not scalded.\\n\\nThey need to re-do their service operations.  Maybe I give them a try in 6 or so months.."},{"name":"Anchovies","address":"433 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had a similar experience to the review below unfortunately.

We had a reservation for noon and the place was pretty much packed. It's a nice dark restaurant with wood floors and tight spaces (the bathroom I visited could easily trigger serious anxiety if you are claustrophobic). We were seated on what could be considered the third floor. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive which was helpful since the water cups are tiny and empty quickly. \\n\\nWe split a dozen raw oysters which was around $35. Pricier than other places I have been, but the quality was noticeable. None were chewy, they were not fishy tasting and they were served basic with cocktail sauce and horseradish on the side. They were really good! Every meal comes with a big square of warm, sweet cornbread. For my meal I had calamari on top of a plate of salad ($15) and the portion was overly generous. Tons of both tentacles and rings atop fresh lettuce. Enough to easily share! My boyfriend went for the lobster roll (I think it was around $30 or so) and I was so happy because I wanted to order it but knew I couldn't finish it. I got a bite and it was deeeeeeeelicious! Lots of meat piled on top that was fresh and tender. I wish I would have ordered the Clam Chowder, but I guess that will have to wait until my next visit. \\n\\nThe menu is strongly seafood based so if you are not a fan, you might have very limited options. They do have a cheeseburger, chicken sandwich and some salad options on the menu. But other than that, this place is focused on fish and shellfish which is why I liked it. While they don't have the most diverse beer options (mainly Sam Adams), Bell in Hand Tavern is right next door.

My Bengali friends gave my foods an inspection and they do say that the dishes are very authentic.  Also, there is a soup offered, tandoori chicken, chicken masala, and a beef curry.  On the left side of the buffet is a Bengali rice pudding, perfect for cooling off the spicy food, a type of chickpea dish that tasted like salsa, and three types of chutneys/yogurts...The red one is VERY VERY spicy.  The lunch buffet is perfect for a sample of authentic Bengali food, but I would probably recommend coming back for dinner when they serve even more unique Bengali foods like okra, lamb, goat, and fish.  Great tasting South Asian food that is different from the normal Indian flavors.  Only thing I would improve is the buffet lighting and labeling of dishes.\\nTIP for buffet...Since most of the buffet choices are watery and runny, I would try as much as possible to not let different gravies mix together in order to really taste the real flavor instead of a mix.  Perhaps using the rice to separate the plate into four quadrants of entrees would help flavor cross-mixing."},{"name":"Jack & Benny's Downtown Diner","address":"12 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The steak breakfast burrito was amazing!

I used to geek-out on beer forums, and Hair of the Dog (known from here on as HotD) came up quite a bit.  The beers were BIG and HARD (to acquire).\\n\\nLater I'd visit Portland and discover there was no HotD brewpub, but there was a brewery.  I tried to arrange a visit, but couldn't work it out.  Instead I settled for taking a couple of bottles up to Mt Tabor on a Sunday Morning (sssshhh, don't tell, and don't worry, I RECYCLED).\\n\\nLater, I'd get to visit the brewery.  Alan, the founder and brewer was incredibly hospitable.\\n\\nNow that I live in Portland, I find that HotD is one of the more esoteric Portland breweries.  It seems it has more fans outside of Portland than inside (the only place I've seen it on tap is Horsebrass, for example).  Hopefully that will all change with the opening of a bona-fide brewpub.\\n\\nAnd just a couple days ago I visited,  it's quite the nice little spot.  Here are my thoughts:\\n\\n- You should know that all of HotD's beers are BIG and BOLD.  By Portland standards they are a little on the sweeter side.  If you like big American Strong Ales and Barley Wines, this is the place for you.  But they also have a very good IPA and even a \\"session ale\\" (for you non-beer geeks, this means a beer you can pound many of, with little effort)  You can get them in 12oz or 3oz sizes.  FOR YOU SUPER BEER GEEKS: they also have vintages of many assorted HotD beers from years gone by in the bottle.  You can only drink them on-site though.  I appreciate this because...the beer geek community tends to create \\"hoarders\\" who will stock pile more beer than they drink.  I know, I used to be one.\\n\\n- The food is surprisingly good and inexpensive.  $6 for some of the savory, melt-in-your mouth brisket?  Yes, please.\\n\\n- The hours, are conservative.  This isn't a \\"late night spot\\", be sure you check the hours before you visit.  I think they are generally 2pm-8pm, Wed-Sun.  (they could change soon though, so consult them first, nothing worse than showing up with a killer beer thirst and having to go home with your tail between your legs...see what I did there?)\\n\\n- The location, is kind of odd-ball, but in a area of Portland that seems to be up-and-coming.  The views of downtown are great.  Rarely do you get any views of downtown from anywhere in SE Portland."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"I consider myself a taco connoisseur...and OH.

When my boyfriend and I walked in I was not paying attention so I ended up getting behind a gentleman waiting for his to go order. Not the best idea to Yelp and walk! Oh well... good thing my boyfriend was vigilant enough to ask where we should go to request a table. He placed us on the wait, but a couple of moments later he noticed two empty bar chairs and we went for it. \\n\\nAt the bar we watched the hustle and bustle of the morning rush. Pretty exciting stuff, so as I waited I had a great time to explore the restaurant. Rosie's has a clean eclectic yet modern feel. There is a tine roof as one of the walls back drop, subway tiles, and pretty amazing lighting. A couple of moments later Clay (the cashier/waitor) came to us laughing and stated he would take care of us. He was one of the only employees relaxed enough to take on the rush. He asked for our drink orders an he went to fetch them. He came back with two to-go cups of water, and he told us it would be a moment for the coffee. Just to fast forward a little, the coffee took approximately 20 minutes to actually arrive to us. \\n\\nAs we sat patiently an older woman with blond hair, assumed to be a manager, noticed our extended waited and offered us four muffins on the house. \\n\\n*Appetizer: Muffins ($3.00)\\nThe muffins were amazing. They were a rich brown assumed to be made with molasses and either pecans/walnuts. So for anyone with food allergies beware of possible nut allergies.\\n\\nApproximately 40 minutes and a terrible encounter with one of the other waitresses our meals finally came out. \\n\\n*Sides: Oatmeal ($2.99)\\nThe presentation was nice. The oatmeal was plated with chopped strawberries and a side of brown sugar. Definitely mix the brown sugar with the oatmeal to bring out a sweeter taste.\\n\\n*Side: Scrambled eggs with cheese ($2.49)\\nThe eggs were scrambled perfected with just the right amount of cheese.\\n\\n*Side: Chicken Sausage ($2.99)\\nI typically prefer my sausage to be cooked a little less crispy. I'm not a fan of burnt edges.\\n\\nOverall this restaurant deserves a A for food and a C- for customer service/restaurant organization. Clay was a superb employee, very nice and friendly, the manager she was also a delight to approach, the muffins were amazing, and the interior, exterior, and marketing is amazing. Pitfalls, the kitchen was terribly slow, the restaurant logistics could be slightly better organized, and Clay's sister (the other waitress) had terrible customer service. She argued with the kitchen staff in front of customers, she rolled her eyes, and she inappropriately interacted with me when I attempted to check on our food. Hopefully on our next trip the restaurant gets more organized and attitudes improve."},{"name":"The Fireside","address":"801 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great Place.

The clubhouse itself is large, but a very odd layout requiring you to travel through the small restaurant/bar area, down a maze of hallways and up several stairs to find the proshop. Staff was friendly throughout my interactions. There is a small driving range and nice putting green area adjacent to the first tee. \\n\\nThe course itself was in great shape when I played in late April 2015. There are many elevation changes throughout the course. Most of the holes were straightforward and boring. The greens were somewhat hard, but rolled nicely. Pace of play for a saturday morning was fair. My biggest complaint would be the lack of any memorable holes throughout the track, with #9 being the only really interesting hole. \\n\\nOverall, MetroWest Golf Club is a nice track just outside downtown Orlando.

Sightings are far and few. No it's not the same as Chicago deep dish. Is ice cream and gelato the same? (If you answered yes, shame on you). \\n\\nVia 313 has honed in and perfected a style of pizza that doesn't get as much recognition as it deserves, one most have never heard of. Detroit style is thick, chewy, squared corner piece goodness. The space itself is extensive both inside and out, and the menu is filled with creative ingredients mashups like pineapple and bacon, or balsamic and prosciutto. \\n\\nFOOD \\nVia 313 offers all pizzas in both small and large. Luckily, half and half is an option for those like myself who find choosing just one completely impossible! \\n\\nDetroiter - very similar to the classic pepperoni, but with two types of pepperoni's per pie. The crust is absolute perfection. Chewy, piping hot, and the wonderful crispy crannies you can only get from corner pieces. A dab of marinara lines the middle of the slice. The pizza as a whole could have benefited from a little more salty component, which you wouldn't expect with pepperoni involved. \\n\\nCadillac - the fan favorite. Not at all your ordinary cookie cutter pizza. Prosciutto and balsamic take center stage. Again, the crust is beyond reproach. This combination has actually become common place over the years. As a result, I do have a point of reference. Unfortunately I don't feel it was well executed. The balsamic glaze is on the thin side, making it almost impossible to remain on the pizza while grabbing a slice. Meanwhile the pruciotto...hmm...Feels more like ham in disguise. Thickly cut and also chewy, the exact opposite of what good pruciotto should be. \\n\\n313 has a lot of good components, including the late night closing time. Not the perfect Detroit style pie, but it certainly hits the spot and satisfies my fix."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"The tacos are life changing.

We (a party of 4) arrived at 11pm, waited in line 29 minutes to order, after we ordered, half of the meal came to our table and our server said the other half was coming out in just a minute. Mind you, this is a fast food place. We waited and waited as several other tables (including a table of 8) that arrived after us got served and our food did not come out. Everyone who had come in after me at this point had been served. We went to the kitchen to inquire about why our food was taking so long and spoke directly to the owner who asked me what our order number was, turned around, and then said \\"it's right here, it's the next one out\\". Throughout all this time, NO ONE has come to our table and our number is still at the table and the rest of the party is waiting to eat. After another 15 minutes pass by and no one has brought the food, we approach our server directly and ask about the food once again. He then says \\"just a couple more minutes\\" and head backs into the kitchen. It has been well over half an hour of waiting for the food at this point, seriously ridiculous. The server after saying that he's \\"going to check on our food\\" continues serving other tables and doesn't come to our table to give us any update on the progress, so we ask again and he says that the order is taking a while because they dropped the order ticket and no one noticed. No apologies at all. He actually states it's our fault because we didn't call his attention to it. We said that we spoke directly to the owner and he said \\"well the owner never told me anything\\". We then ask to speak to the owner and the server says he's going to bring him to our table. We see him speaking to the owner in the kitchen so we stayed waiting for the owner to come to our table, which he never did. We waited 15 minutes, and the owner passes by us several times, cleaned a table next to us, but made NO ATTEMPT to speak to us. At the end of the night, we left after an hour and a half of waiting and speaking to one about the poor service we received. \\n\\nHonestly what kind of business practice is this? This shows you don't care about taking responsibility for your mistakes and have no integrity or work ethic. It's disappointing because the food wasn't bad, but this kind of irresponsible and careless behavior as well as bad customer service matters more than food.

It's the first time coming to BDB for anything other than coffee/ dessert so I was very excited for a more complete dining experience. \\n\\nDriving  down 11th St. in East Austin, it's clear that this area of town is vibrant and still on the upswing. Blue Dahlia sits unassumingly, in true Austin form, with an inviting entranceway. Parking, as far as I could see, was only available along 11 St. on both sides. Thankfully, it was not difficult to find an open spot right in front at 10:30 am. \\n\\nThe rest of my party arrived sooner (sadly, Negar and I were running on 'Greek time' once again) and I was happy to see that they deftly nabbed a wonderful spot in the outside seating area out back. To my delight, this was THE place to sit on a sunny, mild day-- where the makeshift pergola, interesting garden accents and lovely bamboo clumps set a lovely scene. \\n\\nI ordered the Belgian waffles, some fresh squeezed mint lemonade and a black coffee. The waffles were very good and nicely presented, but a bit on the small side (even smaller than my typical Spartan-like portion requirements). Coffee was a bit blah and cooler than ideal, but I should know better than to order a 'coffee without specifications'. Overall, it was a nice spread and the warm sun on my brow, settled any differences between me and the meal.  And what a value. Simply put, BDB is not going to have you calling Barack for a bailout anytime soon.\\n\\nThe rest of my party had what I think was the signature breakfast dish-- the frittata. They all loved it and the portions seemed to be 'just right' without much of a delta in cost. Request that they bring the jelly and nutella jars over to the table. Spreading some nutella on the belgian waffles (or delicious breads) made for an extra tasty treat.  I look forward to trying the oatmeal and the yogurt parfait next time.\\n\\nService was a bit slow and unnecessarily inefficient, but the gals were pleasant when they made it out back to tend to our incessant requests. Perhaps that is the one downside to sitting outside- more infrequent visits from the servers as they seemed a bit understaffed once the BDB got packed. But, again, it's easy to overlook this with the quality of the food and the awesomeness of the atmosphere. \\n\\nLastly, what makes a dining venue really sizzle for me? When you get up to walk out of the restaurant after a satisfying experience and run into familiar faces and friends about to enjoy their own.

I ordered a carry out of the Crispy Chicken Salad.  I failed to realize it came with smoked corn.  I'm getting so gd tired of everyone filling up their salads with corn!!!  Surprised that a place that's considered \\"fancy\\" around here can't get a salad right.  Mostly iceberg lettuce; the chicken was thin, bone-dry, and tasteless - I'm guessing it's left-over from other sauce-filled dishes they served last night. Shredded cheese out of a bag contributed to the blandly dry, crappy meal.  For $13.00, I expected more.  You can get a better salad at Texas Roadhouse (y'all have those around here??  If not, you need one).  My first impression of this place - you can't rely solely on ambiance and character.

Pouring syrup over everything was the icing on the cake.\\n\\nTomato, Basil, and Mozzarella Omelette with Sweet Potato Fries: I love the combination of tomato/basil/mozzarella. They tasted super good in an omelette and the cheese was still gooey on the inside. I was delighted to see that they had Cholula hot sauce on the table because I like a little kick to my omelettes. The tomatoes tasted fresh and the basil flavor was on point. You can tell the basil had a strong flavor but not overpowering. I'm a big fan of sweet potato fries over regular fries and was happy to see that it was only a $1 extra for the substitute.\\n\\nOverall a pretty good place for breakfast/lunch.

A very unique dining experience on multiple levels, all in a very good way. This is a character dining experience themed to Snow White. Disney did an amazing job of transforming the space into the enchanted forest and their attention to detail from the menu, table settings, and the food options truly make you feel immersed in the world of Snow White. There are rare photo opportunities with characters who are not often present at the park. These include the Evil Queen (a special one-on-one meet and greet where there is a PhotoPass Photographer to capture the moment), Dopey, and Grumpy. Of course, Snow White also traverses the restaurant and stops by each table to greet, sign autographs, and take photos with guests. As per most character dining experiences at Disney, the characters follow a preassigned path to ensure they visit each table and their visits are paced out nicely throughout one's meal.\\n\\nIn terms of food, there are a lot of unique offerings that I typically wouldn't eat by choice, however, in dining experiences like this, I have learned to trust the art of the chefs and just go for it! Every meal starts with a shared grouping of appetizers; one of each type of appetizer per person. Again, the choices may not be the most appealing to non-adventurous diners, but all of the appetizers were well-crafted and delicious. I specifically liked the bisque served in a mini cauldron. The next course is an entree you choose. My husband and I both had the prime rib and thought it was perfection! It was paired with a horseradish mashed potato and included veggies and a croissant-like roll. Portions for the prime rib dinner were huge. I could barely finish half of the prime rib. The meal concludes with shared desserts, also themed to Snow White. The show stealer of the dessert with respect to presentation was the Evil Queen's special dessert, brought to the table by our server. Such outstanding attention to detail to tie the experience all together. The other shared desserts are also not typical fare, and although I understand the inclusion of the gooseberry pie for theming purposes, it was the worst dessert out of all of the ones brought to the table. None of the desserts really stood out in terms of taste, and for the amazing effort that was put into creating the appetizers and main entrees, I would have expected a better dessert experience in terms of offering and taste. \\n\\nThe service we experienced was top-notch Disney from the hostesses, to our server, and to the character escorts. It was apparent they were all invested in making the meal a magical one for the guests.\\n\\nI would return to the Storybook Dining at Artist Point again in the future without any hesitation."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Asking my boss if he had ever had ramen and hearing him say that he's never had it was a shock to me. Especially when he had access to it so many times before. So, to introduce him to ramen and how great it is, I decided to take him to Santouka. Solid reviews, and I knew that ramen is hard to make, but if you get it right, it comes out good. I've had pretty nightmarish experiences with ramen too (i'm talking about the restaurant sold $10 instant ramen). \\n\\nRest assured, the ramen here is solid. Not only because it's a second location for Santouka (originally from Japan), but that it was flavorful and everything you look for when looking good ramen. Plus, the line out the door (with reservations) is a pretty good indicator as well. **I would recommend to reserve as well, because you probably wouldn't be able to get in without it...**\\n\\nSo what did I get? When I eyed their menu, one thing just kept screaming out at me: the Spicy Miso Ramen. It paired well on a cold ass night in Boston in February, and it was something that I just sounded great.

Everything else was fine -- the dressing didn't quite taste like caesar but not bad.  The shiitake bacon was very salty and had a distinct burnt taste.  I ended up avoiding it and had a handful of it left at the end.  The maple-wheat croutons were weirdly sweet and just didn't go well with the salad.

He's right and this rolling effect is obviously rare in Florida.\\n\\nI'd say roughly half of the holes have some sort of elevation change, with #2 and #14 standing out most in this category.\\n\\nOne of my favorite holes is the closing hole on the front nine, as this Par 4 reminds me very much of the Par 5 6th hole at Bay Hill as it wraps around a lake to the left bringing water into play on both tee shot and approach. \\n\\n#11 was simply a better hole before they filled in the big fairway bunker on the left side of the landing area. Honestly, it is too pedestrian now and if this hole was modified to appease members and regulars, that's unfortunate. That bunker forced each player to think with his/her tee shot and now there is zero mental aspect to that play.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the course plays slightly shorter than posted yardages (6100 from whites and 6600 from blues) if fairways are rolling out as most Florida fairways do in the early spring and summer months.\\n\\nConditions of tees, fairways and bunkers were above average for my latest round in March 2018, but greens were slightly below average and ran very slow and bumpy. Perhaps it is just bad soil, but certain greens like #10 and #12 often look troubled in multiple spots. \\n\\nBeverage cart ran late into the afternoon while the food and beverage was always available in the clubhouse either for grab and go or dine-in.\\n\\nOh, and since my friend and I needed a quick change of clothes after play before heading to see the 76ers play the Magic that day, who chooses the music played in the locker rooms?

Before they were in their big space, I went to their little space ! \\"Use to be a standard fav of my family!\\"\\n\\nYesterday, I took my son and my friend to a late breakfast at the Cadillac, our server Peter was phenomenal he was very courteous had lots of information for us and Quick and efficient about getting our drinks order and so forth.\\n\\nMy son and I both decided to order the steak and eggs, he ordered his medium well,  I ordered mine medium rare. My friend ordered the macaroni and cheese. I also ordered a side of bacon and I wanted my eggs to be without any dairy so no Gorgonzola.\\n\\nI have to say that I was absolutely shocked at the quality of food that came out of the kitchen my food was cold my sons potatoes were cold my steak was cooked but it  looked like it sat  out for 20 minutes and it was cold. like you could pick it up and it felt cold .  The steak was as well tuff and wasn't nice and steamy!  The potatoes were barely room temperature , my friends mac & cheese was just horrible and of course Peter sent it back. \\n\\nMaybe three minutes later my \\"plate \\"  came back piping hot and the potatoes were still cold the steak was still cold and he brought me a side of fresh potatoes that were very warm. \\n\\nI was told unfortunately the quality of the food has recessed since Rod and Teri sold this place in February. Well I guess that's the problem, when you have owners that are in the building hands-on watching what takes place every day it makes a huge difference in the quality of your business. Just remember nobody loves your business the way you do. Nor will they take care of it the way you will, that is if you really care!\\n\\nYou know I can almost handle mediocre service if the food is just absolutely phenomenal and melts in your mouth. However, this today made me never want to return to this restaurant.  I'm so disappointed at the new owners they have let the quality go in the toilet, they need to get a line cook that knows what the hell they're doing, pay the money for a great chef to run that kitchen! You have a diamond in your hand and you're turning it into a river rock ! \\n\\nGet it together, because Portlanders we know what good breakfast taste like and we know the quality that we've had for over 20 years at the Cadillac Caf√©.\\n\\nI digress"},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was super tiny but the food was huge in flavor!

They now have sangrita, a very necessary tequila chaser, and someone did their research and came up with a spectacular recipe, very impressed. Service was flawless on a weekend. The tacos are much bigger than what i remember but I was still not blown away. They are lacking flavor. Not sure what is needed to punch it up but the mole chicken taco was still a little bland. The skillet dish was crazy good. Also they start up happy hour again after nine. I always thought 4 or 5 was early so I'm digging second wind happy hour. Definitely putting work into getting better and it show. \\n\\n\\n\\nExpectation is a hell of a burden. When a new highly anticipated place opens in your hood, when you watch the brown paper come off the widows and see the beautiful new interior after a year of teasing us with tacos and tequila, you expect to get knocked off tour feet. Well that didn't exactly happen. That said, the place is still decent and has tacos and tequila and is one block from where I live, so I will be back many times and keep trying and I have a feeling my rating might go up. \\n\\nThe place was crowded on a Friday night of their first official week but we got a table quickly.  No reservations for small parties. The service was friendly but a little clumsy. We ordered everything at once and the apps and everything came out at the same time. Drinks came about 15 minutes later. After a little table reorg we fit all of the plates on there. Street corn was great and guacamole was edible but why not make it fresh at the table, that's what the people want. Is there anything better. Instead it came pre made in an ugly dish. Didn't taste bad though but nothing spectacular. Chips were stale and tasteless. That's a no no. The tacos were ok. Again not knocked off my feet. These days I expect a smorgasbord of flavors in a taco but that didn't happen. Chicken mole taco yes, halibut taco absolutely awful. Either do that one better or just do a regular fish taco. Really no good. \\n\\nNo desserts yet, hopefully soon. No tequila chaser or sangrita and no Ingredients to make it. Kind of disappointing. \\n\\nOverall it was ok. If it wasn't a block from my home, I wouldn't go back. There's better elsewhere. But I'm a captive audience. I hope they'll keep improving.

The donuts themselves come in every color unnatural to man (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326692527/), many of which take you back to flavors from your childhood, with several of them being cereal themed. They've even got vegan donuts (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326732447/), if for some reason you enjoy mixing pleasure with pain (all kidding aside, I've actually heard from several vegans these are quite good as well).\\n\\nSince it was already 12:30, I had been eating virtually all day, and had to drive 3 hours back to Seattle and wake up around 7am for work the next day, I figured the best option would be to just get a couple dozen (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327505570/) donuts to take into the office so nobody questioned me as I passed out at my desk that day from a Portland overdose. I decided just to let them pick the donuts, because at $8.50 for a dozen if they choose that's a pretty sweet deal in my mind. He did let me add a couple that I wanted too, which made it all the more worthwhile. One box was heavily loaded with crunchy toppings (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327526780/) and basic options, while the other featured a lot of cereal based (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326805005/) donuts along with some sweeter toppings like coconut. \\n\\nThroughout the week we ended up piecemealing the donuts bit by bit among our team, everyone taking bits of various ones as they walked by each day. As a result I got to taste almost everything, and although I can't recall the names of all of them, I definitely really enjoyed about 75% of all the ones I tried, a pretty hefty percentage considering how much they play around with toppings. Obviously the maple bacon bar (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326698991/) stole the show, and rightfully so. This thing is like magic. It just hooks you, and you suddenly want several dozen of just that one. I would have never guessed such a simple combination could be so amazing, but it's true. I was also a huge fan of the \\"dirt\\" donut covered in Oreos, and the Portland cr√®me pie (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327448502/) which is as fun to eat as it is to look at. Pretty much anything with coconut on top was a hit, although if there was anything I didn't care for too much it was the cereal based donuts, with the exception of the peanut butter glazed donut topped with rice krispies.\\n\\nIf you're knocking Voodoo my guess is that you didn't have a maple bacon bar, and if you DID have one and you're still knocking it, well then I can't help you. Some things are idyllic for a reason, and Voodoo has created their own little slice of fantasy out on the West coast."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"8300 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"I wish I could give less than one star! 25 minutes in the drive through EVERY SINGLE TIME I go here.

They're served with horse radish, mignonette, house made saltines, and a house hot sauce, so you can prep them any way you like them.

When I asked a different waitress about our food she went to check and came back and told me she was very but our waitresses hadn't put in our order \\"properly\\" so the kitchen never got it. We were so hungry and frustrated that we didn't want to leave and go find another place which would mean another 20 mins so we waited. We got out salads 40 mins after ordering. If we hasn't asked the waitress about it we may have been waiting there till closing time with no food!!\\nThis exact same thing happened a Second time where we ordered food and waited over 25 mins for a salad. My guess is someone messed up out order again but they wouldn't admit it. We got a small discount on that meal but left very disappointed with the service.\\n\\nToday a month later I came back to try it one last time before giving up on this spot entirely since I really do love their food.

It was pretty disappointing, but I'd go back for oysters.\\n\\nI reserved a table explicitly, not a high-top, but we were seated in a very empty restaurant at a high top.  We had dollar oysters, which were small and delicious.  The mignonette was ok but not amazing, unlike Lineage where it was zippy and bright.  The table bread was bizarrely sweet.  My husband ordered a glass of wine and it nearly emptied the bottle.  Instead of just giving him a generous pour (for his birthday, which the restaurant knew) the server took a seriously small amount of wine back somewhere for some other purpose.  A missed opportunity to make people feel really welcome, but fine.  Then we had some good food for dinner, except they served like days-old-cooked bell peppers that were slimy from sitting around after being cooked with the hangar steak--completely inedible.  The steak was cooked well, but the sauce was way too salty.  Street corn was delish, the fried oyster slider was fine but not thrilling, and the french fries with fish and chips were not great at all.  Nothing wrong with them, but not good fries: boring, bland, under salted.  \\nSo we ask for the check, pay, and the server comes back with sorbet for my husband's birthday, which was very sweet...until we got our change and they had BILLED US FOR HIS BIRTHDAY SORBET WE DIDN'T ORDER.  She printed out a new bill!  It was only $3, but WOW.  It was jaw-dropping.  Have you ever been billed extra for going somewhere on your birthday?  \\n\\nLineage was a community place. I didn't expect it to feel the same at Island Creek in Burlington, but I didn't expect it to be sort of alienating!

The chicken legs were greasier than expected, but it wasn't horrible. The potato salad was good. It was creamy and potato-y. I liked the dumplings. They were soft and flavorful.

The servers barely acknowledged us and at one point server 1 handed us our menus as we were standing but did not take us to a table. Finally, the server 2 sat us at our table. Server 1 then proceeded to take the order of the table that was sat after us. When she finally made it to our table there was no greeting only \\"do you know what you want?\\" I gave my order and then was told they were out of french toast and texas toast. I quickly decided on an alternative (because who knows how long it would have taken her to come back). She brought our drinks and we waited for our food. At least 30 minutes go by and nothing. No refill on our drinks just waiting. While we were waiting, several parties came in and were not greeted and so they left. One family of 5 stopped at our table and asked if we had been waiting for long. We said yes and then they left. During the time we spent waiting at least 5 parties who had come in to eat left and there were open tables but they weren't bussed and cleaned. Server 2 spent the majority of the time on her phone and server 1 never came back to our table. Finally, the table that came after us but ordered first got their food so we figured we were next. Another 15 minutes go by and still nothing. At this point, we had been waiting almost an hour for food. Finally, I see 2 orders of chicken and waffles set out by the cooks. This was exactly what we ordered. Unfortunately, server 2 got the plates and set them down to 2 other customers who had definitely come in way after us. I also saw that some to go orders were also ready for some customers who had come in after us. At this point I am furious and I walk up to server 1 at the register. I stand there and she makes no eye contact with me and instead is on the iPad. I say to her that I'm upset and ask when will we get our food. She looks at me, says nothing and then turns back to the iPad. Server 2 jumps in and says \\"oh no, they had a to go order already\\". I tell her I'm more upset about that fact that the people at the counter and the people at the table had come in after us yet they were eating. Furthermore, the people at the counter had our exact same order so why would theirs come out first? I say, at this point, we are the only people in the establishment who have not received their food. The two servers just stare at me. Literally blank stares. Again, I am furious. So, I ask when will we be getting our food?? Server 2 says \\"that's what we'd like to know\\" and just shrugged her shoulders. So, my head is about to explode at this point thinking WTF? Are you serious right now??  They give me more blank stares so I turn around and we leave. \\n\\nWe wasted damn near 2 hours in this establishment and walked away with NOTHING. I have never been to a place as unprofessional as Rosie's and I will certainly never return."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Being the tourists that we were, this was a must try before we left the city.

The outside of the building is colorful and when you get close to the doors, they have a menu on the wall so you could start gauging your options.\\n\\nInside is quite quirky (as you can see in the pictures).  A lot going on in there, but it keeps you distracted from how long you've been waiting in line :-)   they do shuffle people through pretty efficiently though.  \\n\\n*pro tip: look at the menu outside and at the display cases inside so you are ready to order \\n\\nAs for the donuts, I really enjoyed my Portland Cream donut.  The chocolate on top was thicker than your average mom and pop shop chocolate glaze.  Almost more like a fudge, if that makes sense.  The dough was good...lighter than Blue Star's dough, but thicker than a mom and pop store.  The vanilla custard inside was really good!\\n\\nMy husband wasn't so keen on his voodoo doll donut.  While he liked the chocolate on top, he thought that the donut was a little stale.  \\n\\nThe cannolo was pretty good.  I liked the almond filling and it was a nice, light option.  Careful when you bite though, the dough unravels!  \\n\\nAll in all, glad we tried it out.  Would I come back?  Yes...for the Portland Cream donut and the weird decor.

One of my new top favorite steak houses in Atlanta. It's located in Brookhaven and it's sort of hidden which I like. There's valet parking and I think there's also a regular parking but I'm not sure. The valet parking is tip only. It's a big restaurant with multiple areas and levels. Each area/level or differently decorated. There's a bar upstairs and I think there's even an outdoor seating area when it's nice outside. Deborah was our server and she was outstanding. Great recommendations and excellent service. We did make a reservation to come here and I'm glad we did, while there were tons of reservations to place got packed pretty quickly. It's beautifully decorated. We started out with the bacon and ribs, waygu beef. The bacon was pretty good. The ribs however or fall off the bone delicious and well marinated. Lots of flavor. The drinks were also yummy. We ended up getting a steak, waygu steak with truffles on top, the truffles are an extra 30+ dollars (just FYI bc I was surprised) BUT They are fresh and delicious and plentiful and there's a delicious truffle butter as well on top of it. We got the baked Alaska for dessert along with the chocolate mousse cake. The baked Alaska was pistachio cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream, and if you like mint chocolate chip ice cream this is right up your alley because it's got excellent flavors. I'm not a fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream. But I truly enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake. This place is pretty expensive and it's not someplace you can go to every weekend unless you want to throw down some serious cash for dinner. It's a great place for fancy dinners, dates that you want to impress or just someplace nice and expensive to go to once in a while. I recommend you go here!! We had an excellent time and I'll definitely be back but in a little while when I can save up some cash. lol.

I ended up getting a kale salad that usually comes with grilled chicken, but I swapped the roast chicken for the crispy chicken that comes in the sand which.  They were very accommodating to my request.  Two other folks I was with ordered the sand which.  I think everyone enjoyed their dish but in my review, I have to be honest.  The food was good, but the crispy chicken wasn't what I'd expect. It was not really \\"crispy\\" but rather a thick batter that was actually hard to chew into.  Maybe some people like that, but my idea of crispy chicken would be to have the crisp factor, but still be tender enough to easily break through and get to the moist chicken meat.  In this case, I felt the outside batter was encasing the meat and it was just too thick and hard to eat. Actually since mine was on a salad, I used a fork and knife and I'll say it was actually hard for me to cut into the chicken.  In the end, I gave one piece to someone else at my table and left the last piece because it was just too hard to cut. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just not my taste. The place itself is very comfortable and service was great.  I'd def go back and recommend, just not the crispy chicken for me.\\n\\nOther notes- I was unclear about parking so parked in the parking deck.  Rather full but found a spot. I was lucky they were letting free e trance that day (midweek lunch tine) but I hear it's expensive otherwise.

It was kind of funny because every time a gentleman that looked like he may have been a supervisor would walk into the room where the tables were being cleaned the woman would pick up her pace. The last time he went in there he was looking at his watch but he never jumped in to help her, being that she wasn't working at the pace that was necessary to lessen the wait. It would have been nice to see him get in there and help especially since you could see the room clearly from the waiting area. \\n\\nOKAY!

I was trying to imagine how this burrito would even hold up without the sauce on top. As per usual with wet burritos I used a knife and fork to cut, the issue with this particular burrito was the tortilla was so hard to cut at the bottom. The only thing I had was a butter knife and it really wasn't cutting the extremely hard pieces of tortilla. It turned into a mess and the tortilla was just useless so I ate everything else.

I'm very big on rooftop bars, as it's the only thing I ever do in NYC once spring hits. Even on a Sunday, this place was relatively packed. We preferred a table but as soon as we entered the lobby of the building, they told us we would have to wait 40 mins for a table. If not, we can just go up and grab a drink at the bar. So we decided to do the latter as we were pressed on time. The bar was super crowded but we managed to get a drink after a while. What was really disappointing was that they had closed off all ways to get near the windows to see the view. I thought that was the whole point of the restaurant. So I somehow sneaked my way around and luckily got a picture in but was told I couldn't be in the area and had to go back to the bar. You can't see the view at all from the bar as they have shelves and shelves of liquor bottles obstructing the view. Who interior designed this place?! The drinks were subpar. I ordered a whiskey sour and it wasn't well prepared and was most likely made with just regular sour mix as opposed to the proper way of making one (fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, egg whites). Only drank 1/4 of my whiskey sour and headed out. A very mediocre experience."},{"name":"TGI Fridays","address":"10811 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"My husband and I miss the endless apps.

For those of you unfamiliar with it, every March, a hundred or so restaurants in the Portland area participate to provide a fixed-price three course dining experience.  This year, it's $33 a person.\\n\\nWe decided to hit up Gracie's on a Friday night.\\n\\nSeated promptly for our 6:00 reservations, we were presented with their regular menu and also the Portland Dining Month menu card.  Gracie's has three choices for each course (so basically, you could create nine different dinner combinations) and for an additional $12, each course would be paired with its own glass of wine.\\n\\nWife N loved the wine pairing idea and went with it.  I on the other hand fancied a \\"Flaming Negroni\\".  Look, just like a Manhattan, everyone has their cool take on a Negroni and (along with the Manhattan) Gracie's is no different.  What was different was that theirs was on fire.  Upon delivering the tipple, the server will light on fire, at your table, a 151-soaked orange rind skewered with cloves and after a few seconds of fanfare, drop the incendiary citrus into what is on its own a perfectly admirable Negroni.  And with the quick pfffftt of the orange rind dousing itself into your drink, it is served.  Nice.  Most entertaining Negroni I've ever experienced.\\n\\nCourse 1:  I ordered the Beet Salad (caracara oranges, horseradish, honey, pistachios, goat cheese and shave-sliced melba toast).  I loved everything about this--beets were perfectly cooked and tender and the orange, pistachio and goat cheese harmonized all in one bite.  What wasn't in every bite, but was really nice when I did catch it, was the horseradish.  This dish had a great balance of sweet, salt, zip, and herbal.  Excellent.  Wife N. had the Blackened Gulf Prawns (avocado, grilled scallions, tomato coulis, cilantro, and threaded corn chips). She gave me a tiny bite, and what I had was marvelous.  Loved the flavor on the prawns. Pairing: WVV Estate Chard 2016.  Great wine that both stood up to, and cooled down, the blackened shrimp. Nailed it.  \\n\\nCourse 2: Me: Chantrelle Ravioli (Pecorino, White Truffle, Rose Beurre blanc).  Mushroom lovers, rejoice!  Awesome and cheesy (but upscale) this dish had plenty of mushroom flavor, both in the ravioli and in the sauce.  What I didn't get, though, was the rose beurre blanc.  There was sauce on it, but it was more like a mushroom and romano cream reduction than a rose beurre blanc.  I got no rose.  BUT: the dish was fabulous. Everything was just spot on--anyone who loves mushrooms and truffles will love this.  Wife N. got the Beef Cheeks (parsley potatos, carrots, roasted leeks, pink peppercorns). Really nice.  Tasted like it had been in a pressure cooker for hours. just falling-apart tender, great flavors in the reduction, and those leeks---oh those leeks those were beautifully tender and sweet. Very nicely composed dish.  Pairing: WVV Elton Pinot Noir 2013.  Nailed it again, beautifully earthy and an excellent complement to the beef.\\n\\nCourse 3: I had the layered White Chocolate Mousse with Raspberry Coulis.  Oh, heaven.  And it just kept giving the whole way through.  Wife had the Espresso Chocolate Cake (Kahlua Ganache, Cinnamon Nutmeg Butter cream).  I'm not a chocolate cake guy, but it tasted \\"pretty good\\" to me.  Wife N is a very chocolate cake lady, and thought it was fantastic.  Her fork clashed with mine as I went for the smallest little bit of the frosting and she glared at me, explaining the frosting didn't fall over because she was ignoring it.  It fell over because she was focusing on the cake, and that she intended to save the frosting for last, as \\"it's the best part\\".  I did manage to sneak a bit of it, and I concur--that's some excellent cinnamon frosting.  Pairing: WVV Pinot Port.  Beautiful.\\n\\nExcellent meal and a great representative of what we expect for Portland Dining Month.  We'll be back to check out some of the other dishes.\\n\\n-Dan"},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ford Fry rarely misses and this OG westside spot never disappoints.

It was the right start and to accompany the cheese we ordered Lychee Martinis which further enhanced the taste. The cocktails were mildly sweet and you could actually taste the alcohol (a big plus).\\n\\nThe second item we ordered was Lobster Macaroni & Cheese. Again a very well cooked dish. A bit heavy so perfect to share and a nice twist to the American classic.\\n\\nNow the few flaws. Firstly they were either over booked or under staffed. And even though our server was sweet, he was in a rush and didn't even mention the evening specials. We just assumed they didn't have any contrary to what's stated on their site.\\n\\nSecondly the main course we ordered was Fried Fish curry; the vegetables in it were raw.

As they don't take reservations and I've heard about the long waits if you don't get in at opening time, my friend and I decided to plan accordingly this weekend to go early and wait in line before the doors open at 5:30pm. \\n\\nWe arrived at 5:20pm and there was already a line up with about 20 people. We made it in by 5:40pm. A cheering shout out to the young lady who took down the names of the guests outside as she pleasantly greeted all the people in the line up and also thanked us for coming, waiting and informed us how much longer we had to wait. Wow, what service and we haven't even sat down yet!\\n\\nAll the plates are served family style so we ordered 3 items for the 2 of us to share:\\n1. Fried cauliflower, chickpeas, herbs & aioli. The dish was tasty and enjoyed having a warm veggie dish on a cooler night. I found the cauliflower more panned fried than deep fried thus not as crispy. The cauliflowers on the bottom were also soaking up in oil thus limped. Still enjoyed. \\n2. Spaghetti nero, clams & bagna cauda (a hot dish made from garlic and anchovies). Loved the crispy deep fried garlic chips over the pasta as it provided a surprising crunch to a plain pasta. If you don't enjoyed a spicy hot kick to your meal then this item is not for you. I enjoyed the first few bites then the salt was building up on my tongue. \\n3. Pappardelle & wild boar ragu. The thick pasta was cooked al dente and the ragu was mixed perfectly with the pasta. Served warm and most delicious with the first few bits and the again a bit too salty near the middle and end.\\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed with the two pasta dishes as it was just a bit too salty (and I enjoy salty types of food). Salt shouldn't be the last and lingering taste. It's a shame as the pasta were cooked perfectly. The service was excellent throughout. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

Unfortunately, the experience was a complete letdown. The one good thing was the food- pancakes were delicious- otherwise I'd leave just 1 star. \\n\\nThere was an hour wait, and my friends got there a bit earlier than me and got a little table on the right patio of the restaurant. I joined them and after some time realized there was no one coming to take drink orders. I went inside to ask where I should order and they directed me to the other side of a patio where they said a cocktail waitress would come by. I found it so bizarre I had to wait on the other side of the restaurant and just wait standing in the sun by myself waiting to order while my friends were seated together on the other side of the patio. The staff didn't seem to care an ounce about how inconvenient this was and shrugged me off. The cocktail waitress was nice, though people on the patio who were there before me were complaining about the long drink wait time- she explained the bar was very backed up.\\n\\nFinally after returning to my friends, we were eventually called in to be seated (after waiting well over an hour). When I asked for a water- I was told I'd have to pay for a bottle of still water (essentially a .99 bottle of water upcharged to $3) due to Austin's current water boil situation. I've been out to plenty of places and not a single business- including casual sports bars- has charged me for water during the situation. When I questioned it the waitress shrugged and said \\"it's not our fault there's a water boil notice. It would be so expensive for use to give out bottled water for free.\\" If casual businesses assume it's worth doing for their customers, than I think it's safe to say this trendy, pricey place could afford to consider their customers as well.\\n\\nFinally, two friends at our table were visiting with England and needed an itemized receipt for work. The waitress told us this was just not possible with their system. We asked to have her manager involved, and she ultimately was able to get their two checks itemized... though she had our friend do all the work of writing down on a piece of paper the items belonging to them. It then took close to 15 minutes to get our checks back.\\n\\nOverall- the several incidents we ran into were met with little care or sympathy from staff.

Her attitude was so bad, that the person I was on the phone with had a comment about it. (Strike-4) I still supported my local establishment and ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich, got my food and left. When I returned to the office (across the street) to eat the sandwich (which was soggy) (and as if things couldn't get any worse) I found hair cooked in the egg whites. Before my meeting, I immediately phoned the manager she asked me to bring the sandwich back in order to get another one. Am I not the one that was inconvenience I paid 11.00 for a sandwich that I cannot eat. Not only that I have to keep it (smells) in my office until I can go back up there to return the sandwich in exchange for my money back..... long story short it's not worth it.

My mom relentlessly searched the internet all day for a restaurant that would fit my (numerous) demands: ambience, steak, desserts, and unique drinks. We made a reservation and requested a seat with the view-- when we arrived, they sat us right by the window with a great view of the BeltLine! Our waitress came by and asked us if we were celebrating anything. Of course, I was feeling celebratory as heck after finishing my exam!! So we let her know the good news. \\n\\nDrinks: I got a drink to start (called Blue something?) which was like a fruity modified mule. 5/5\\nAppetizers: You get complimentary bread served with a spread (I think it was ricotta?)... tasty but definitely an acquired taste. Then we ordered the baked oysters to start. Note-- there are only 5 per plate, so if you're a larger group get a couple! The oysters were baked with cheese and bacon... delectable. 5/5\\nDinner: I ordered the Bistro Steak and my mom ordered the burger. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals! Can't comment on the burger, but the Bistro Steak was wonderful with a chimichurri topping, mushrooms, green beans, and some heavenly whipped potatoes. The burger comes with some VERY sizable onion rings. \\nDessert: The waitress was kind enough to bring me a brownie a la mode to help me celebrate!! Loved the brownie and vanilla ice cream. We also ordered the coconut cake, which was unfortunately a little dry. \\nAmbience/Environment: This is in such a cool part of Atlanta and the building looks like an old factory inside. Super cool. And it's right on the Beltline so you can walk out the back door and enjoy a nice walk to work off some of those whipped potato calories.

Their homemade habanero hot sauce is a definite must order on the side to dip your yucca fries or just to add a touch to any of your dishes to just set it over the top. The simple beet salad with the sesame oil was also an amazing choice and the quinoa vegetable plate was just enough for the table to share. All the items we ordered were vegetarian and gluten free friendly. \\n\\nAs for dessert they had an amazing blackberry lime sorbet which was creamy and a perfect pallet cleanser after such a decadent meal.

We had to weave through about 6 very closely set tables. It was loud because the tables were on top of each other. It was akin to a wedding reception, not an Easter brunch. \\n\\nMany of the food choices were empty, cold or of low quality. The Canadian bacon on the eggs Benedict was a thinly sliced deli ham.  Soggy bacon, unseasoned potatoes and cold french toast rounded out breakfast.  Very limited options if you didn't want the Asian food or breakfast food. Bagels with only lox to choose from as a topping. There were no traditional sides that went with the ham or roast beef. The only vegetable was mala green beans. The desserts tasted previously frozen (and the two waiters manning this station faught with each other about one of them stepping away). $200 for 5 people for that level of food and ambiance is not at all worth it.

But, much like the burritos, what's on the inside is incredible! And, for the record, they have a nice little patio area which you should be able enjoy for the two weeks a year the temperatures are sub-110 degrees. Just sayin'. \\n\\nLike other people, I asked the difference between a burrita and burrito. Size is part of it but the burrita is mostly just meat and cheese while the burrito has other stuff like lettuce inside. \\n\\nThat mystery being solved, I ordered a steak burrito and a spiced pork taco. The taco's are street tacos meaning they don't have a ton of stuff loaded in them. Meat, cheese, cilantro and a lime wedge on the side. Honestly, if the meat is good, that's all you need. And this meat was incredible. Great flavor. It was apparent they use quality ingredients. If you want more on your taco, I would suggest this fancy little place around the corner called Taco Bell. Have fun with that. \\n\\nThe burrito was huge. The steak was excellent and the fillings were not overwhelming. I ate every bite but I was quite full afterwards. \\n\\nThey brought me 4 sauces to try. My favorite was the \\"hot\\" one. Yes, it had some good heat to it but it wasn't overwhelming and had good flavor as well. Any idiot can throw a bunch of Carolina Reapers in a sauce and make you question your life choices as you sit on the toilet praying for the lava god to make it stop but to make something that compliments the food takes skill. There was also a green chile sauce with a bit less heat, a no heat sauce with some tang (I'm assuming tomatillos) and a brown no heat sauce that was more savory than anything. \\n\\nFinally, the staff was incredibly friendly. I had a few questions before and after I ate and they were most accommodating. \\n\\nMy only complaint would be that the menu is a la carte and the chips and salsa seemed a but pricey although since I didn't order them, I'm not sure how much you get. Maybe they literally bring out a wheelbarrow loaded with chips and a bucket of salsa, I don't know. I doubt it but it'd be pretty cool if they did. \\n\\nIf you're in the Ocoee area, this place is most definitely worth a shot. \\n\\nOh wait! One more thing.

Everyone in our group had a different favorite - the corn, prosciutto cotto, and spicy sausage. I have the feeling that if we had ordered three different pizzas from the menu, we would have loved them all too! Had the house wine - fun to learn it comes from the owner's vineyard in Sicily.

Pappardelle alla bolognese and fried egg was amazing. Pasta was at a perfect al dente, fried egg still had a runny yolk and added nicely to the bolognese sauce.

BS reviews on quality and service. This place is garbage. It's unorganized. And those of you who are stating that \\"they do things different, but it's working for them\\", is complete BS and a ridiculous encouragement to an establishment that doesn't know how to operate. It's not working for them. What's working, is that there aren't enough breakfast spots in the neighborhood, so no one wants to wait in long lines at businesses near by, leaving this place as the next option. I would rather wait 1-2 hours for quality food and quality service then eat here again. That's what good food is all about. Otherwise you can buy the Paramount BS.\\n\\nHere's my experience. \\n\\nWe arrived as a group of 5. There were 4 empty tables open and available. It wasn't busy, and only 2 people ordering. As we walked in 3 of us sat down at the largest table towards the front, to put down our rain coats and umbrellas, so no one was carrying them around. The other 2 headed straight to the sign labeled ORDER HERE at the end of the restaurant. About 10 seconds went by, and a gentlemen comes literally yelling at the other 3 saying \\"you can't sit down, until you order and pay\\". He pointed at a sign on the wall and said \\"you have to get up\\". \\nWhen we told him we were in line placing an order for the group, he mentions again \\"that's policy\\" and points on the wall again.\\nNow, as we stand in front of the CHEF, under the ORDER HERE sign...yes the CHEF. All we here is the chef and the lady at the register yelling back and forth, arguing about what they need to complete and why haven't they completed it yet. Then another girl who's pouring beverages assisting the cashier gets in on it, meanwhile we're just standing there a bit confused to who we need to get our order to, and just sit down. \\nAfter 2 minutes of arguing back and forth while we stand there and another group begins to build and watch this all from behind us. The chef turns and looks at us and asks us what we wanted. Quickly and without any pause, we gave him an order of 5 plates. Then he tells us \\"ok\\", he turns around and begins working on the order. \\nWe step literally 2 feet forward towards the cashier and she repeats the same question and asks us  \\"what did you order?\\". WoW..... We repeated the order to her. While we're repeating the order she walks away towards the chef while we're in mid-sentence and they begin arguing again. Ummmmmmm hello. WTF...did you just ask for my order and then walk away from me? Yes you did. So then she and him and the assistant pouring beverages started going at it again. Then a guy from the far back of the kitchen started yelling and they went at it with him. While we waited for about 4 minutes after she was suppose to take our order and collect money. We watched there drama routine play out. Super unprofessional and very sad to experience in a food establishment in such an eloquent neighborhood.\\nThen the beverage girl asks us what we wanted to drink while cashier lady continues her rant back turned to us, walking up and down behind the bar in and out of the kitchen. We gave the assistant our drink order and she began pouring the drinks. The first cup she pulls out, covered in lipstick and what looked like dry orange juice pulp all over it. She poured into the cup anyways. I stopped her and told her, \\"this is dirty\\". She paused and looked at it, and then the guy who had yelled at us at entry came up from behind and grabbed it and removed it from the counter and told her, \\"don't use it\\". \\nThen finally the cashier made the few seconds to get her self back into position to take our order and ring us up. While she was ringing up our order, she asked 3 times for us to repeat the order. The order was not complicated. There were no special requests. 5 dish's that's all. It couldn't have been that hard for someone who knows their menu. And now that we're paying, they are expecting a tip before service and the meal is delivered. Double WTF??? Service is earned, not handed to you because you have a POS and a sellers permit. \\n\\nWe finally walked away and went to sit down. 10 minutes later our food comes out, 1 at a time. The food was nothing spectacular whatsoever. The potatoes were cold. The toast was super thin and the French Toast was not brioche as advertised. $70 for five lousy dishes and awful service. Not worth it at all. \\nThere are 2 other spots near by that do a phenomenal job. I recommend Tatte Bakery as the best. Long lines and 30 minute wait is worth every penny you spend and bite you take. \\n\\nYou folks who are leaving good reviews for this place with no content to back it up, is just pure non-sense. This place is horrible. You need a consultant in operations and customer service. You'll be able to turn your tables, provide better service, and make more money if you just keep a hostess at the front and convert your bidders and to servers."},{"name":"Anchovies","address":"433 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I came to Anchovies last night for their famous dirty martinis with a few other friends of mine.

She had long brown hair and tattoos. I understand the bar was busy. The sad part is that we would have stayed because we genuinely came for the martinis.\\n\\nAs someone with a customer service background and sales person, she either needs to relax with a dirty martini herself or maybe she cannot handle the amount of people that were at the bar.

We all have lived in the city for five years and just genuinely wanted a dope martini.

The menu was so limited and most items from the dining room were not available.  Much fewer choices then when I worked there.  The fresh shucked oysters and little necks were the only bright spot.   All the food came out together, including the apps we ordered.   The clam chowder was ok, but not hot by any stretch.  The burger sliders were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted.

Ambience/decor was more for the older crowd, but I'm not complaining! I'm just used to being excited by the hipster kind of decor. But taking that preference aside, everything was exceptional. Best place to eat food. \\n\\nI would say this food, though nothing unique in offerings (llomo saltado, cebiche/ceviche, and tapas are common), the taste and quality of food rivaled everything else I've had from home (Bay Area pride! woot woot!). I love Peruvian food!\\n\\nAmbiance: (4/5) Dim lighting (very intimate but how can I take foodie pics without flashing everyone?! :P), very home-y. The owner came by and asked us how everything was. Usually this kind of gesture can err on the side of being too invasive and awkward, but she came when I was already in love with the food, the service, the everything that this just tipped it over for me. She was sweet and made me feel like I just ate a meal cooked from a loving grandma. (Don't worry, I'm not cheating on you, gma!)\\n\\nService: (5.5/5) Beyond exceptional. They were accomodating. We showed up to our 10PM reservations 15 minutes early and they gave us water while we waited since we hadn't drink enough water after the Feast PDX festival.\\n\\nFood (6/5)!!: We ordered:\\n\\n1. DE PESCADO \\"5 ELEMENTOS\\" Cebiche - (4.5/5). It tasted so good and was very solid. Best cebiche ever? No, but definitely not a let down and definitely mighty tasty.\\\\\\n\\n2. CONCHAS A LA PARMESANA (5/5): Bay scallops in cheese and lime. When deciding between small/large, Server said the small is like 5 tiny scallops, but it's more like 20 smaller scallops, which would be perfect for two people. I would have wanted more if the bigger size wasn't so pricey and if my stomach was an endless pit! :) We literally drank the juice/broth at the bottom of the thing. It was SO good. I've never had something that good. But I LOVE scallops. I didn't expect to be so in love with something as simple as scallops and cheese.\\n\\n3. ENSALADA VERDE PERUANA (3/5): The salad was underwhelming compared to the rest of the delicious meal. I usually love salads, but I felt that I could have saved on this and grabbed something else. But I tell myself, I need the acid and fiber to break up the yumminess of dinner.\\n\\n4. ARROZ CON MARISCOS Peruvian style paella: (5/5): Okay, let me start off by saying I ALWAYS order Seafood Paella if there is an option at Peruvian places. Its one of those dishes that have so many interpretations and they always taste different, but I love that about it. So the one at Andina... was the best one that I've tried so far. :) It's not what I'm used to. I'm used to the seafood being mixed in with the rice, but it's outside of the pile of rice so I felt that was a little weird. Flavor-wise, this is my favorite Seafood Paella of all the ones I've tried to date.\\n\\nAndina, you have stolen my heart.

After it was apparent that I was becoming very offended by her attitude, she mentioned that she could still put the order in if we wanted. HELL NO! With that girl and that attitude, we couldn't risk the chance of it coming back without a wad of spit in it.

(especially if you need to go to Chicken Sausage Town, which probably has a horrible amusement park).\\n\\nA delightful aspect of my breakfast was the Hazelnut French Custard Toast, which didn't even need syrup.  Granted, the charred fur of Free Range Tickle Me Elmo would be edible with that much hazelnut and butter. (Not that I tried, I eat all my Muppets al dente).\\n\\nMy potatoes were pleasant  enough but a little over-browned,  the George Hamilton of tubers if you will. \\n\\nThe 3 star rating is pretty much egg-based.  Both mine and one of my dining  companions eggs were undercooked. Not raw per se, but  they were supposed to be fried but were less congealed than the Brady Bunch pre-marriage.  Pretty bad. (both the family and the eggs--not you Marsha, you get a pass. Wink).\\n\\nI've gotta note that i wasn't a fan of the decor.  Quick, word association:  Cadillac= missing teeth Elvis fan, Cadillac= grandma leaving her turn signal on, Cadillac=53 in a 65,  you get the idea.  I think whenever you have a car obsession you should collect it in your garage or wait until you turn 12 and grow out of it.\\n\\nI guess it does make the room unpretentious as it should be given the volume of the place, but take the full size car out and put in 6 more tables please.  Hell, keep  it and I'll eat on the hood if it will cut down on the wait time.\\n\\nThe staff was efficient, yet could not have been more distant if they took my order via satellite.  In German.

It really was excellent.  \\n\\nThe star of everyone else's meal was the Suspension Cake, which was so big, it looked like something out of _2001: A Space Odyssey_.  I mean, the thing cast a shadow.

To our surprise the worst customer service I've ever experienced. The waitress was very  inattentive as if she was being bothered by our party of four asking questions since it was our first time at this establishment. As you know this establishment is African American based and we are Africa  Americans, so of course we didn't think that we would be treated any different than any other customer. To our surprise we had a Caucasian waitress who was very inattentive to us and acted as if we were a bother she didn't do anything that we asked her to do which is a norm anywhere else such as us asking about the different items on the menu  coming back with a bottle of wine( which was Avery cheap bottle of wine that was marked up) didn't come over to open the wine , didn't clear any dishes was very rude and stank to put it plainly. When the birthday person asked about a desert she sighed and finally came back with menus then when asked about a particular desert she stayed \\"I'm sure it taste like any other desert\\"   Once we were completely finished with our meal and waiting on our checks a friend that we knew came over and say with us and decided to order food so the waitress finally came back with our checks to our surprise she added 18% gratuity and when asked why she stayed that you had a party of five and I then informed her no we asked for a table of for four and you served a table of four just because someone comes and sit at your table at the end of your meal does not mean you tack on another person in order to gain gratuity and how dare you with the service you provided. The busboy who was doing all the work and taking our concerns and doing everything she should have been doing  went to get a manager and the male manager claimed it \\"well it's restaurant policy for a party of five to charge\\" I the asked where is it posted and where is it on the menu? He stated well it's not but it just is. So I asked the busboy to go and get the other manager and when he did the waitress came back over for payment and I told her I'm waiting to speak to the manager she then spewed some nonsense oh they're going to call the police if you don't pay your bill, I said you need to step away and let me speak to the manager she says I'm telling you they going to say you're trying to run out without paying your bill I said oh am I trying to run out and I'm sitting here with credit card in hand.. Finally manager came over again I explained everything all over again and she apologized and said she wish she had known. Well my thought was if you were running the restaurant you'd know what's going on in your restaurant and what's really bad food was cold and not fresh; appetizers were good. Busboy should be a manager because he managed the entire time and it's sad because the manager didn't know his name she stated he must be new.

Definitely coming back."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A good but underwhelming experience, and you'll probably be poorer after eating there (pun intended!).\\n\\nGetting there: There's reason Poor Calvin's offers a complimentary Uber service to and from the restaurant (restrictions apply to location, and you have to reserve ahead of time)-- it's hard to find parking. The actual lot for the restaurant is small compared to how many people it can hold inside. I'm sure you can find street parking nearby wandering around, but I opted to play it safe (as the paranoid OTP-er I am) and pay $10 to park at the lot on the corner Peachtree and Renaissance Parkway (by Gladys Knight's chicken). \\n\\nThe ambiance: romantic, intimate, and trendy. You enter to see the bar, and a deceptively small looking lobby. But walk past that, and the open facing kitchen, and you'll be taken to the back of the restaurant that was additional seating. Plenty of tables there, including a few for larger parties. I would argue that our section was almost TOO dim. We could hardly read our menus. And trying to take food pictures required additional lighting. No, I'm not embarrassed to ask my girlfriend for a flashlight from her phone. We were seated next to a wall and window, and on a dreadfully frigid night, the draft was creeping up on me the entire time. \\n\\nAnd of course, the food: For starters, I got the Beef Satay, since I always love the chicken satay available at most Thai places. The beef was a nice twist, and it was flavorful and tender. Peanut sauce still made a good pairing with a different meat. My friends got some steamed dumplings, which were even more tender and just as tasty. So far so good.\\n\\nOften times with entrees, I end up getting exactly the dish I end up enjoying, to the envy of my girlfriend. This time, we reversed roles. It seems from other reviews that the Lobster Fried Rice is the thing to get. But I thought to myself, how good can fried rice really be? Let's get something more high-end, like duck. So I went with the Duck Dynasty ($28). It's a dish with seared maple leaf duck breast, and grilled tiger shrimp, served with Parmesan kale mashed potatoes (sweet potatoes I think), and grilled asparagus. Pretty much everything on the plate was good. It tasted sophisticated, not too salty or over-spiced, the meat was properly cooked, and presentation was classy. But it wasn't mind blowing-ly good, which was my expectation going in. On the other hand, I enjoyed the Lobster Fried Rice far more. It comprised of fried rice made of eggs, diced greens, and a tempura lobster tail (for $29). The best way to describe it is a more high end tasting fried rice. But ask yourself, can't you get pretty damn good fried rice for $5 at the corner Chinese takeout? Probably. So while this dish was good, it wasn't 600% better as the price would indicate. I should add the serving size is decently large on both dishes, enough to eat once, and have a half portion for leftovers. \\n\\nFinally, finished off the meal with two desserts. I opted for the Toasted Pound Cake, because I saw the words \\"ice cream\\" and \\"green tea glaze.\\" I was surprised to see that the pound cake itself was green, sitting under some vanilla and nutty ice cream. Some sweet warm bananas completed the construction of this giant dessert. Taste wise, it was good, not as sweet as it looked. I kind of wish it was more like a simple brownie and ice cream though. The other dessert we got was the Bourbon Whiskey Banana Pudding. And can you guess what I'm going to say next? Yep, it was good but not spectacular. \\n\\nSo the theme of the night is not living up to lofty expectations. It's not the fault of the restaurant. Offering the Uber drop off and pick up is a nice touch; the service was outstanding (kudos to Matt for being on point the entire time); and presentation as a whole is high quality as you'd expect. The weak point happens to be the food. It has a hard time living up to the hype. I am partly to blame for ordering a full 3 courses and drinks, but my ticket came out to a dollar shy of 3 digits. Seeing I'm not baller status, that's a bit high for the good but not great food I got. Combine that with some of the other minor gripes like lack of parking and lighting, and I feel I can't give it more than a solid 3 stars experience."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Touristy.....sure but hey the donuts are pretty darn good and I will tourist it up for sugary fried dough any day of the week.   \\nI'd pass on the maple blunt if you are looking for a decent amount of maple.

We were hungry and our tastebuds were ready for it. It was well past the lunch rush, and apparently they had been slammed, because as we approached the front door we were greeted with a huge overflowing trash can (for the outside eating area). It was literally packed down and spilling into a huge pile of trash on the floor, which people had to step through to get in. As we entered, we again saw several overflowing trash receptacles and trash on the floor surrounding them all. There was also trash all over tables and the floor in the dining area. (I suppose, because people figured what's the point of trying to put in the trash bin). It smelled bad and there was no visible employee making any effort to clean.\\n\\nSince we had been on the road many hours, I needed to use the restroom before ordering. Big mistake. Disgusting and piled up with trash, dirty toilets, sinks, floors... everything. But the on a positive note... there was hot water, soap and paper towels.

It was decent, but not anything memorable which was surprising because I love a few of Ford Fry's restaurants here in Atlanta.  Perhaps this restaurant is better suited for dinner?  Brunch is a very trendy market in Atlanta so I understand the draw for restaurants to want to participate and capitalize off this trend, but not everyone has the ability to do it well.  Let's get into it.\\n\\nThe Food:  There were 5 people with us.  Between us we ordered the warm donuts for the start, the Duke burger, the brisket hash, eggs Benedict, steak and eggs, the chicken fried chicken biscuit.  The donuts were delightful.  The chicken fried chicken biscuit is literally drowned in gravy.  It would be better if the sauce was provided on the side.  The eggs Benedict was not that good as the ham appears to be a salty prosciutto type of ham that is shredded and piled on top of the biscuit.  Everything else was decent.  None of these items came with any sides which is a disappointment.  \\n\\nYou can only order family sized portions of grits or bacon for a side...so the sides/accompaniments are limited and made for sharing only.  It would be nice if there was a better selection of small side dishes that could accompany meals (breakfast potatoes, grits, bacon, turkey sausage, fruit, salads, etc.)  \\n\\nThe Drinks:  The bloody Mary's are good.  The mimosas are not.  \\n\\nThe Service:  Everyone on the wait staff was very friendly.  Our server simply did his job, but didn't offer much insight into the establishment or the meals.

It could have been because we came in during a Saturday afternoon, so it was pretty empty aside from the people who started arriving for a wedding that was planned there for later on that day. Even during the day, the building felt a bit creepy- it has that shadowy, old school type look still, and smelled like it could use some renovating. \\n\\nThey have the restaurant and I think all of the different themed bars/rooms on the first level of the building. One has spirits (including ones they distilled), and the Boiler Room has a jukebox, shuffleboard, and pool tables (this was probably the most interesting room to hang out in). We just tried the Terminator Stout, which was just ok for me- it was very bubbly for some reason, and not very heavy bodied (more like a porter consistency). \\n\\nI've only been to one other McMenamins (in Downtown, so it wasn't that big), but I haven't been that impressed by the beers I've tried.

First off this restaurant should be classified as a $$$$ not a $$$ restaurant.  The wine is $12-16 a glass, Oysters $2-2.75 each, appetizers are  $10 minimum, the cheapest entree is al carte at $30 (for their chicken) and tops out at $70 for the steak, all entrees are al carte.  The sides start at $10 but as a bonus are shareable.  Maybe on that hot date you can share an appetizer, order the chicken (damage control or hedge against the steak ) and have beer, while being to full for desert to get out under $65 each (with a tip knowing only you know how much that is going to be...).  Seriously though, I have traveled the world and have had exceptional meals at many restaurants that come in at $100 per person and felt I have had an excellent meal and were also good value at that price. \\n\\nLet's get into the details, this was a big dinner celebration, my son graduated college and we were celebrating.  We had a reservation for five and were seated after a short wait in a beautiful dining room with an awesome bar as a center point.  We ordered drinks a couple of the party had water (dietary restrictions), my wife iced tea?, my son a nice IPA and I had a Trappist beer (a Westmalle Dubbel) to start.  We ordered appetizers, she crab soup, fish chowder and an order of fried calamari.  I had the fish chowder which came  in a good portion, but had little fish in it (I gave away the biggest piece to my wife for her taste ).  The accompanying broth was good tasting but not exceptional for lack of the good stuff.  My wife's she crab soup which I did get a couple of spoonfuls (I told her I gave her my fish) was good but not great, it also lacked those essential crab pieces.  There are places in Savannah GA that would blow it out of the water in taste, level of sherry, buttery taste and fresh amount of crab and price!  The calamari was very good maybe exceptional as it was super tender (obviously well prepared and fresh).  The only complaint I had was where was the accompanying sauce, but found it on the bottom and in some cases it was hard to get what I thought a good portion size pieces a good amount of the hidden sauce. \\n\\nI ordered the Bronzino (fish) served with the head on (which they politely asked me if it was acceptable) prepared with capers and pignoli nuts.  I had this fish before in Europe and in a Greek restaurant (PA) that flew their fish directly from the Mediterranean and displayed their fish proudly to the customers for selection and freshness.  Quite honestly when it came, I as a avid fisherman thought this was a fish I would have tossed back!  My fears were realized as I had to scavenge little bits and pieces of fish that at the thickest was not a centimeter thick!  My son though was really enjoying his halibut dinner and my wife had the scallops.  I had a taste of one of the four fairly large sea scallops which were on point for preparation, taste and presentation (of course $8 each with no side).   I ordered three sides for the table, hush puppies, fried rice and fried potatoes, with bacon and cream.  The hush puppies were odd and touted as beignets being served with a yummy maple butter and sprinkled heavily with powdered sugar.  Not sure why these were sides as they would have been a better desert, portion was nicely sized. The fried rice was not to our taste as it had a fish sauce mixed in that did not agree with me as it was rather salty and a little bitter, while the portion was generous.  The fried potatoes were excellent, think the supreme potato nacho with thick bits of scrumptious bacon and very fresh kind of sour cream.  Everyone passed on desert so we called it a day.  \\nFood 1-5 The bronzino was a joke, portion size would have been sad for an appetizer.  Soup good not great.  See above! \\nService 2-4 Our waitress, after we ordered drinks never brought my wife's iced tea and after delivering drinks two times and not asking if we were good had to be reminded.  She apologized and got it quickly, but this is not $$$$ or $$$ restaurant service! They did not ask us if we wanted another drink so I they missed out and I skipped my glass of wine...  They were polite and fairly knowledgeable of menu.  The manager did come by twice to check in and I did not (due to event and company) say anything, which I would have, otherwise. \\nAtmosphere 4.5 The atmosphere is very nice and the best feature of the restaurant on our visit. \\nPrice 2 My definition of value for food service for the price we paid which came in over $350 did not meet my expectations. \\nOA 2.5 - 3.5? The Optimist has some very good food  if you pick right, you may have a good experience, it is overpriced for the service we received and does not meet my value proposition.

My family got the Froot Loops, maple bacon log, and the Oreo vanilla raised doughnuts. I would love to go back and try more flavors! The prices are a bit high for doughnuts but then again these are fancier doughnuts then what you'd get at a Dunkin'. They are more like desserts then a breakfast meal.

They have eight options for ramen bowls. I've tried two of them and they were both pretty good. You can add yourself to the yelp waitlist so you don't have to go right away. You will order your food at the hostess stand, so it cuts down your waiting time for the food when you're actually sitting at the table. An unconventional way of doing things, but it's a very small restaurant so they try and have a fast turn over time for the tables. Try to go at a time when it isn't that busy unless you're looking for wait for an extensive amount of time."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"After reading a lot of bad reviews on the place I was very skeptical on my reservations that were made. It was my two year anniversary and we arrived for a 8:15 PM reservation, and was kindly asked to wait at the bar. The bar was full, but we managed to snag a seat a few minutes after standing. We weren't seated until 9:00 PM (& not by the window like we had requested) but we did enjoy a nice drink at the bar (Wish it had better views by the window though). I had read a lot of reviews about the staff and waiters being bratty and snobby, but we didn't experience that at all! It was a Friday night so I expected it to be busy, and it was, but nothing that we couldn't accommodate to. We had a lovely waitress, Jessica, who was very attentive to us. She was so friendly and sweet, she took our picture by the window once a table was cleared. Food was good, despite what other critics said. Really wish we had a window seat, but guess that means we will just have to go back at a less busy time.

We managed to snag a last-minute reservation, but I would recommend booking early if you want to try this place.\\n\\nWe ordered the following dishes to share:\\n-Sopa del Dia (tomato soup): the soup had a rich and creamy flavor, but I didn't think it was worth $9 for a bowl.\\n-Anticuchos de Pulpo (grilled octopus): this dish's presentation was impressive, but the texture of the octopus wasn't quite right. It tasted a bit leathery.\\n-Palta Rellena de Cangrejo (avocado stuffed with crab): this dish was pretty mediocre. The crab lacked real flavor.\\n-Pimiento Piquillo Relleno (stuffed peppers): this dish was also just okay. It didn't leave a very strong impression.\\n-Carne Empanadas: I enjoyed this dish. The stuffing was pretty good and I actually liked the dusting of powder sugar on the exterior of the empanadas. It added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the savory interior.\\n-Arroz con Pato (duck leg with rice): I liked the texture of the duck, but I was not a fan of the sauce that was poured over it. The sauce was too sour and overwhelmed the dish completely.\\n-Arroz con Mariscos (seafood paella): I am a huge fan of paella, but this dish fell a bit flat for me. The temperature of this dish felt oddly lukewarm instead of piping hot which made it less appetizing.\\n\\nThere were some dishes that were pretty good, but overall I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the menu items we ordered (especially taking into consideration the high price of this restaurant).

The friend I was traveling with is vegetarian, so Andina seemed like a good choice.\\n\\nI made reservations maybe a month in advance and had zero trouble picking my desired date and time. I would definitely recommend making a reservation here, as it was completely packed when we came for dinner Friday night around 7:30. \\n\\nThey have two levels, the main floor you walk into and a basement level that was decorated to look like you were in a different country (maybe modeled after the streets of a Peruvian city?). I was hoping our table would be on the lower level, but alas we were seated on the main floor. There's a nice romantic vibe which comes from the dimly lit interior. This seemed to be a good spot for special occasions as well, as we saw some birthday parties.\\n\\nWe started out with a cocktail each. I went with a margarita ($13), which was just okay. My friend's mojito ($11.50) was delicious though, so I'd definitely recommend that. Most of the cocktails are in the $11-13 range so pricey, but not terrible by SF standards.\\n\\nWhen my friend asked for our server's recommendations on vegetarian dishes, I was impressed when he brought out a separate menu just for vegetarians. Not too many restaurants do this so kudos to Andina for making my friend's life a little bit easier.\\n\\nWe each ordered an appetizer and entree:\\n\\nTortilla de papa ($10) - if you like potatoes, get this dish especially if you have a bigger group as the portions are huge!! It's more like a potato and egg cake rather than a flatter tortilla, since the slices are huge. It is a little on the bland side, but we were given a spicy sauce that my friend used generously with this dish and he really enjoyed it.\\n\\nDe pulpo ($14 for the smaller order) - OMG this was by far the highlight of the meal for me. The octopus was prepared excellently and each bite had the perfect texture of soft and chewy. A bit pricey since you're only getting one tentacle for the price but would highly recommend. Order more of this if you're in a group since everyone will want their own!\\n\\nHongos saltado ($23) - my vegetarian friend typically doesn't like mushrooms, but he did enjoy this dish. You have a couple types of mushrooms sauteed with onions and tomatoes in a sweet soy-based sauce. The mushrooms are quite flavorful, but I wish there was more of the garlic rice. My friend definitely ran out of rice pretty quickly.\\n\\nArroz con mariscos ($28) - I was disappointed by my Peruvian style paella. It comes with a good amount of seafood (mussels, octopus, shrimp, fried white fish, and a seared diver scallop), but again I felt like the portion of rice wasn't enough. Also, I didn't realize there would be bits of cilantro mixed in the rice, so I was tasting it in every bite which I didn't like. The mix of seafood was all delicious except for the chunks of fish which were flavorless and quite dry.\\n\\nWe ended with the helado de lucama ($8) dessert, as it is ice cream made from the national fruit of Peru. I've never had this fruit before, but neither my friend nor I were a fan as it tasted a bit odd to us. We both tried a couple spoonfuls and left the rest.\\n\\nService was attentive as you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Near the beginning of the meal, one of the owners (or at least the mom of the owner?) came over to greet us and welcome us to the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch.\\n\\nParking in the area wasn't bad. We parked maybe 2 blocks away at a metered spot but we saw more open spots as we walked to the restaurant.\\n\\nWe paid ~$140 for dinner + drinks for the two of us."},{"name":"Rosemary Rocksalt","address":"1350 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Went in this morning to get a dozen bagels and they customer service was stellar!

We both ordered off of that menu, although their regular menu is awesome and loaded with apps, breakfast items and dinner items.\\nWe started with drinks - my dining partner in crime got a pumpkin beer with cinnamon on the rim. Yum. I went with the 50 Shades of Earl Grey cocktail. Perfect. Loved the flavor.\\nFor dinner, he went with the bat out of hell burger which appropriately featured a huge chunk of meatloaf and also came with nice and salty waffle fries. I went with the meatloaf benny. Huge chunk of meatloaf with just the right amount of spice, perfectly done eggs, amazing home fries and a delicious piece of thick oatmeal toast. It was perfection. Zero complaints on anything with the two meals. I can't wait to go back and get it again honestly!\\nFriendly staff, great prices (and donating to charity!), amazing funky decor and delicious food.

It's literally the only restaurant between my office and South Station so I've tried really hard to like it. I just can't continue to piss money away here anymore hoping for an improvement. Tonight took the cake as I ordered a $40 hamburger and glass of wine and proceeded to wait 35 minutes for my burger. Ordered medium rare, served well done, it was a flavorless hockey puck that was drenched in a very mild cheese and a day glow mayo sauce that seemed more appropriate on a Big Mac. I would have complained but I was nearing the verge of missing my train and took my shit burger with me to eat on the purple line. The fries were ok and the star of the meal was a homemade pickle that was thrown in the box without care. The icing on this misery was that they gave me public restroom style napkins with my order.

There's not much room between the bar seats and tables. \\n\\nThe menu selection is limited, as is often the case with ramen places. I ordered the spicy miso ramen.

The oreo was a great touch but when it came to the donut, it almost tasted like it was filled with sugar.\\n* Voodoo Doll - $3.50 (3/5) \\n -The classic donut that most people get for the picture. This donut was  chocolate donut with a jelly filling inside. It wasn't the best donut. Mine was a little deflated and the chocolate melted way too easily.

It was a very unique and a healthy app!    We ordered the tomahawk pork, which was 14oz and the scallop risotto, which had 3 scallop and 2 shrimp and a very thick risotto. We ended up getting the Double Chocolate cake to go, which is pictured.  Overall really good food.  Negative was the service and why the rate is at 4 and why it's probably on Living Social because the service was not well.  Our server started off strong, but left us hanging quite a bit.

Decor- once you finally navigate how to enter this facility it is nice...beautifully decorated! It's gives off a modern chic sexiness.\\n\\n3. Drinks- amazing!!!\\n\\nCons\\n\\n1. Location-  is quite underwhelming. When you turn into the area where it is physically placed...it looks like  an industrial wasteland with no clear direction on where the entrance is and nowhere to park. I get it, save money by remodeling an empty warehouse. Community development is key. \\n\\n2. Parking- nowhere to park so everyone must use valet parking which was clearly understaffed so we waited in line for 20 minutes to have our car valeted. This made us late for our reservation. The \\"One way in , one way out on an industrial platform\\" model can get really backed up on a weekend. And of course it was backed up. It was chaos and disappointment. \\n\\n3. Music- the facility is so nice! But the live music was off. Bluegrass  in a place like this took away from the entire vibe. Maybe have jazz or soul house? \\n\\n4. Service- was hit or miss.

Instead of waiting for a table, we sat at the bar.  We were greeted and handed menus by a very friendly young lady.  The breakfast and lunch menus are fairly deep, but really seem to just be upscale Elmer's Americana-style selections, with some curious flavors thrown in for good measure.\\n\\nI ordered the pork sandwich and JP, now going strong down the vegetarian/pescatarian path, went with a white rice and steamed vegetable dish.  We both ordered a cup of the soup of the day, which was clam chowder.  We expected that the clam chowder would have been brought out immediately.  But after about ten minutes and the chowder not showing up, we thought, dagnamit, they're going to bring out the chowder with the rest of our food.  \\n\\nIn order to avoid that, I asked our waitress if we could get our chowder right away and she muttered something but still didn't bring us the chowder.  Sure enough, ten minutes later, she brought the chowder out along with the rest of our food.  Grr!  The chowder was creamy and had plenty of nice sized chunks of clam.

Curiously, it had a flavor like Rogue Ale's Shakespeare Stout.\\n\\nJP thought his rice and steamed vegetable dish was good.  But I damn near fell asleep just looking at it.  My pork sandwich came with slices of apple, gorgonzola cheese and green onion on sourdough bread.  My mouth exploded in a noisy cinnamon fest upon first bite.  What was going on here?  I opened the sandwich and discovered that the apple slices were thickly chalked with cinnamon.  Fortunately, yanking the apple slices from the sandwich yielded a now delicious sandwich. I loved the creamy somewhat tart gorgonzola cheese.

Admittedly, I will offer a shot of Gammel Dansk to an unsuspecting guest to see their reaction (and it can be precious).  As far as Broder's aquavits - thumbs up to the pristine clear Aalborg.  A dash always improves a martini.\\n \\nEntering Broder to the sound of Aretha Franklin, I was seated promptly by a hipster Dane.  I definitely got the feeling this restaurant is dominated by regulars and I felt a bit the outsider.  \\n\\nThe cold ceramic tile wall which served as my seatback in this tiny restaurant restrains me from describing Broder as \\"hyggelig\\" (Danish for cozy and comfortable).  But yes, do add points for the curtain they have in the entry to cut down on cold air coming in.\\n\\nI ordered the Royal Pot Roast sandwich and the soup of the day - potato chive.  Even though the restaurant was not filled, I observed that the small stove prevents orders from being delivered to the tables quickly.\\n\\nHowever, the food is very much worth the wait.  The potato soup had a wonderful smooth and thick texture.  Seasoned just right and served at a perfect temperature.  \\n\\nThe roast beef sandwich was outstanding.  It came with a delicious creamy horseradish sauce and a little bowl of pickled carrot, beet and cucumber. Because the top half of the toasted bun was set jauntily halfway off the sandwich I took that as the cue that this was to be eaten as a Danish open-face sandwich, i.e. with a fork.  The roast beef was flavorful and came with a few rings of red onion.  Absolutely perfect!\\n\\nI saw that many people ordered the aebleskiver, which come with three different dipping jams/sauces.    The menu calls them Danish \\"pancakes\\", but I like to think of them as little round waffles since it's really a waffle recipe.  I do have an aebleskiver skillet at home, but I'd rather have Broder's skillet.

The bowl was so full with noodles that it was hard to stir until some of the noodles had been eaten. Once there was room enough to stir I did so and from the bottom of the bowl a dead bug appears. I stopped eating and it took several minutes to get our waiters attention. He did not ask if I wanted it made again or anything. He took away the food and asked the kitchen to make it again. He apologized but he also asked me if the bug had gotten in the food after it was served. That was not the case but I don't see how it matters. He then asked if we wanted the food to go, to which I said yes because my appetite was gone. He then gave us the food to go and a full priced bill. No manager was brought over and no real amends were made. I was very disappointed because up until then we had really been enjoying the food and experience.

I'll update with her name once I find my receipt. I would recommend asking for her. \\n\\nWe were all iffy about ordering the booze shakes, so we decided to pick 3 and share them 2 per person as one alone is about as much as a burger. So from strongest to weakest alcohol tasting; BOOTY SHAKE which you could taste the whiskey immediately on the first sip. Next would be the EL DUDERINO, slight taste of alcohol but smooth and still some what sweet. Perfect middle of the road shake. Last we picked the STIMULUS PACKAGE which is also modest on sweetness with a slight after taste of the amaretto. Any light weights out there should pick this.\\n\\nI ordered the Sweet Potato Kettle Chips for starters, they were decent. Thinly sliced but missing something as it was pretty much bland if you didn't use the blue cheese dipping sauce. \\nOur table ordered a variety of beef burgers with single, double, and even 2 ordering triple patties. I myself ordered the Double Beef Cowboy style and a side of onion rings as reading other reviews stated the fries were pretty much lower end frozen crinkle cuts. The food is brought out on rectangle metal trays, reminiscent to a dentist's tray they place their tools on. (Maybe this is part of the \\"Killer\\" name/theme???)  Even though the burgers are some what still small, the trays do serve a purpose as the grease and sauce from my burger were still dripping, I actually over hung half of my tray above my lap as I always seem to get something on my clothes when wearing khaki shorts or a white shirt. That seem to calm any fear and catch the drippings of my burger. Visually the burger looks pretty packed, wrapped neatly aside from the cheese sticking to the wrapper itself, and should have tons of flavor. But unfortunately the burgers taste some what dry, especially once you get to the middle and lacking in flavor. Very much missing something. As compared  to the other H&F, Anne's Snack Shack, even Flip- Grindhouse has some tinkering that's needed to be done in order to compete. The onion rings were about average. fried to near crunchy while not being too greasy but still lacking flavor. I think having their own dipping sauce would help with this.\\n\\nWhat saves this place was our awesome server, we should have listened to her when she asked if she wanted to split our checks for a party of 6 to save on confusion for some of the calculating we attempted on our own. Wow...6 of us Asians and we still missed out on the .12 cents we didn't add due to tax. Don't copy off on us on a math test. =\\\\. Even with a party of 6 our server still didn't add the automatic gratuity. \\n\\nSo overall, food needs work. I'm not sure who the diners who reviewed before got as a server but I would say the service was excellent. 2.5, and only with a MAYBE on coming back if the taste gets improved on."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I decided to try Frank on a whim while waiting to see a movie at the paramount.

While we didn't see a children's menu, we didn't mind, as everything was reasonably priced anyway. However, our youngest diner was 8, so for those with younger children you might find it problematic. The oldest grandson had grilled cheese ( several kinds of cheeses made for a stringy, gooey sandwich that had me questioning, \\"why didn't I order that\\". Our younger traveler ordered the French toast, it was absolutely covered in cinnamon and everything one could want in French toast, served with maple syrup. My husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich and thought it was fantastic. The chicken was breaded and fried to perfection with a fresh, tasty coleslaw on top. A toasted bun and great homemade French fries rounded out his meal. I opted for the shrimp po boy, also with the FF. The po boy was delightful, breaded shrimp,  breaded pickles with a tasty remoulade, with  chopped tomatoes all expertly done and served on a hoagie roll. I didn't bother to eat the bun, not that it wasn't tempting, but a gal has to make concessions somewhere when eating fried shrimp and French fries. Craft beers and specialty sodas rounded the whole experience out. Top it all off with a knowledgeable, friendly server and 66.00 check before tip and you have a recipe for success.

I live in Grandview and I was unaware of what Bar 145 actually was, in my mind it was a Zauber type place, probably because they are physically located 200 ft from each other. Well news flash, it's a huge almost club-like bar with a stage and DJ?!...\\"?!\\" that's me being bewildered by the entire thing. And they're a burger joint with a huge menu including a spinach salad?! (singular favorite food: Spinach) maybe I'm a weirdo, but that's irrelevant. \\n\\nAaaaannywaaaays. Stay focused. They had lots of high top tables and a great drink selection. Plenty of beers on tap and the good stuff too, for those who choose not to recognize Mich and Bud as friends, Jackie O was there with quite a few of his crafty friends. \\n\\nI had a cocktail, like a few if them actually. The drink menu is huuuge. Since I'm staring at it, there are 13 signature cocktails, not including the 12 martinis. I had the Angry Bird: vodka, Angry Orchard, Sour Apple Schnapps, and I quote, \\"a few Bar 145 suprises\\"...I did not realize that ingredient until now, and yes, it's an eyebrow raiser, but just drink up. \\n\\nGive Bar 145 a shot, or martini ha ha anyways they also have a large patio so my explorations here have just begun.

Most know it as Valentine's Day. I've known it as Eternal Singles Awareness Day. Still, my friend asked me if it would be okay, and, me thinking about the fact it's an authentic restaurant attached to a halal grocery store (and so there's no way it would be filled with lovey-dovey, googly-eyed lovebirds staring heart-shaped holes into each other's skulls), I told him it would be fine.\\n\\nTrue to my thoughts, when I'd entered a little before 7:30pm there was one table occupied with a group of three male friends chatting, and just the cashier/server at the till. Practically empty.\\n\\nWe'd placed our orders at the register, paid, and had a seat at one of the pedestal tables toward the front. The table was uneven, and I did my best to ignore it as it wobbled periodically as one of us touched it.\\n\\nI'd ordered a plate of vegetable biryani (Bengali-style, so it had potatoes mostly), and my friend the Bangladeshi-style chicken roast. We both also asked for 1 naan. Each table has a pitcher of water, so that was our beverage. Upon ordering, the cashier/server, a nice, soft-spoken and patient, young guy, said it would be about ten minutes.\\n\\nTrue to form, that's about how long it took to come out. Both our plates were practically heaving with food, and the naan, sectioned in fours, seemed larger than I'd even thought. The plates also came with a side of vegetables (onion, small penciled cucumbers, and chopped lettuce).\\n\\nWe dug in, relishing every bite, the both of us. The spices were just right (even more so for my friend, who had the somewhat funny misfortune to bite into a piece of a hot pepper he'd thought was a green bean, and spent the next couple minutes recuperating). They'd placed plastic spoons with our food for eating, but my friend ended up needing a fork and knife to really get into the chicken, since part of it was a drumstick still on the bone (as opposed to \\"cubed\\" chicken as the menu had described); that didn't stop him from enjoying it tremendously.\\n\\nOn a neighboring table there were bottles of chutney that I'd meant to try, but hadn't. It looked a lot like something my part-Indian great aunt would make and send us sometimes. The food didn't need it, though.\\n\\nI'd ended up taking the rest home because I'd felt stuffed.

The broccoli rabe (spelling?) appetizer served with sausage was servied on a 12-14 \\" rectangular plate which was crazy big for the 5\\" section being occupied by the food.  Taking themselves too seriously in this case.  The food was fine but a bit much on the red pepper flakes...what is it with those anyway?

Anyway back to the crushed red pepper flakes...brought to the table in a 4-5\\" bowl which held enough of them for weeks of usage if not months.crazy.  Also ordered Lasagna (portion way too small for an average male) and average at best in the flavor profile.  Ordered spaghetti and meatballs and sausage - it was fine but nothing really that differentiated it from say an average Italian restaurant.  Now for the service....I asked the waiter to box up the 1/2 pizza as we didn't finish it.  He did so and he returned to our table appearing to look for a place to put it - I pointed to the pepper flakes and said we didn't need them (thinking if he took that away there would be room on the table).  Instead , he apparently understood that I didn't want the pizza (you know the one I asked him to box up....yea I know), when I noticed what happened I went to correct him but he had gone somewhere out of sight, so I told the hostess about the mix up and she went to find him.  He returned to the table saying he was sorry but had already thrown it out.

Staff pass us by several times in normal demeanor. I even pushed the menus out over the edge of the table as far as they would defy gravity and made eye contact with two employees but the hints weren't taken. The last straw for me was when the booth next to us was waited on when they arrived 5-10 minutes after us.

It seems like their agenda is to push on to you whatever product they need to get off the shelves. I've been a customer for over two years, and recently I came here wanting to purchase an Orion mod. The employee working the counter convinced me that purchasing an Orchid was a way better choice. Fast forward not even two months, I returned to the store to buy more pods for the mod system. The owner of the store says that they've had a recall on the pods due to them tasting like heavy chemicals. There was another customer there at the time with an actual Orion, ready to sell me another piece of equipment, I stopped him in his tracks telling him that, that was what I wanted from the beginning but his employee convinced me to get the current mod I am having issues with right now. No apology was even mustered up, no discount offered for a new proper working device, no advice on how I could fix my situation.

I tried the apple cider Manhattan and my friend got a really nice spiced mule. They did have some daily specials too. The prices are good. My friend got a fig salad. That looked delicious actually. Huge and they added salmon upon request. My mother got a meatball sandwich and I went with one of their specialty pizzas (Lil Joey). The pizza wasn't that good. Very dry and overcooked on the bottom and really no taste to it. I even asked for grated cheese to add to it along with the red pepper flakes on the table to try to make it tastier. The meatball sandwich was just okay. I'm not sure what they used for spices but neither my mother or I liked them and has a sickish feeling from them.

First thing I did was try the flowers to see if it was edible, they're not for consumption, bitter. Warning please. \\n\\nMy overall thoughts are that the curry somewhat makes the taste of the duck itself underwhelming so I'm not confident in saying it's the best combo. What I can say is that it's an enjoyable combo because I like both duck and curry. The red curry gives a more sweet than spicy taste, good choice for those that can't handle the spice. Excited to try the curry filet mignon.\\n\\nAlso had a taste of my friend's general tsao's chicken, a classic Chinese American dish. My thoughts are... not bad.

There are a lot of tight fairways and a decent amount of hazards so if you're a beginner bring many balls.  Minus having a dead cart here and there, I have a good experience. They have three sets of 9. Heritage, legacy, and tradition. I personally think Legacy is the most challenging of the three when playing from the tips. But tradition is my favorite. For the amount of golfers they have they take pretty good care of the course. Some bunkers and greens could use some love but for what you pay the course it worth it. Another plus is The employees at Heritage are always friendly. If you haven't played there I would definitely recommend to go soon. It a great find hidden in Tucker.

My favorite style is Gringo($6.99), it has jalapenos, avocado, pico de gallo, black bean spread and diablo sauce.  It's spicy and goes perfectly with the veggie patty. The veggie burger consists of quinoa, black beans, onion, carrots and chickpeas. I also love their crinkly cut fries and just have my grindhouse sauce on the side to dip them in.

I took a chance on poor Calvin's and was so impressed with the quality of the food, portions and the flavor was off the damn chain. I highly recommend this place to anybody that wants to find food that tastes amazing!

Like everyone else has said, this place is huge! Such a nice break from the cramped restaurants that are everywhere in Austin. They have incense in the bathroom and the whole place is super clean!\\n\\nOnto the food - I LOVED the calamari, it was probably one of the best calamaris I've had. There was a lemon sauce that came with it that was -heavenly- and the squid had the perfect flavor. I definitely recommend it, even if you haven't had squid before! I shared the dishes with the two other people I was with and we all agreed that the pineapple fried rice was the winner. The orange chicken and seasame chicken both kind of tasted the same, and to be honest they kind of tasted like slightly better quality Panda Express. Both of the chicken dishes did come with rice though, which was nice.\\n\\nI'm definitely coming back here to try the pho and the octopus skewers! I don't think I would order the chicken again, but based on how good the other dishes were I think it makes up for it!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"300 District Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Every time i am in Bedford I have to eat their lobster roll!

Quality has been consistent for decades.  Nicky still works making the pizzas after all these years.  I never realized how addicted I was until they burned down a few years back and I had cravings specifically for their unique blend of flavors.  They still prep the ingredients and don't use the bagged frozen crap that a lot of places have switched to.  That goes a long way with me.\\n\\nTheir subs, particularly the steak bomb, are great too."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been coming here for years and sadly, this will be my last time. \\n\\nFirst, they have priced themselves beyond the \\"level\\" of restaurant that they are and the food does not reflect those prices. \\n\\nWe came in with a party of eight (four couples) on a slow Saturday afternoon. We had drinks, which are \\"Boston\\" expensive (Brew beers $7-$8, Martini $13, \\"measured\\" whiskey starting at $9). When I ordered the Southern ribs (which is why I went there specifically and looked forward to having those for a week), they waiter said, \\"we don't carry those anymore.\\" BIG strike one! Why are they still on the menu, not crossed off, no note or why didn't you tell us after bringing us drinks for thirty minutes? You're a BBQ restaurant! \\n\\nSo, I begrudgingly but politely made an alternate choice of baby backs and brisket and then ordered  mashed potatoes as one of my sides. \\"We don't have mashed potatoes today.\\"  Fine! Really? I laughed.\\n\\nWhen all the food came out, ALL eight meals were over-cooked: Baby backs, brisket, salmon, burgers, turkey tips, steak tips. Two meals were taken off when they complained. Not sure if they would have taken all the meals off if we all complained. It would have to be inedible for me to complain.\\n\\nIn all fairness, its a cool atmosphere and the service was good and prompt and they at least did the right thing for the two who complained. But if your food isn't good and its too expensive ... well... \\n\\nI'm bummed because it's hard to find a good BBQ  restaurant without driving to Boston."},{"name":"Island Wing Company Bar & Grill - Hunters Creek","address":"2079 W Town Center Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The hummus here is delish!

Both of them were incredibly friendly and professional. The General Manager, another Scott was very attentive and kind to us. \\n\\nThis was first class service in a new age restaurant.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n\\nMust get their oysters (come with a beautiful medley of cucumber ice, mignonette, cocktail sauce and what appeared to be homemade hot sauce). Super fresh.\\n\\nShrimp de Jonghe - fabulous dish, get the bread service just so you can dip the bread in this shrimp de jonghe broth.\\n\\nBacon - very unique, almost an Asian flavor to it. It's very thick like pork belly but there no way not to like this dish.\\n\\nWedge Salad - looked great, but I didn't try it\\n\\nSteaks:\\n\\nSteaks are SLIGHTLY thinner than other steakhouses in Atlanta (which I actually LIKED!). Unlike other steakhouses, these steaks aren't doused in stale butter and they are reasonable sizes with a solid selection (I had the Spinalis which was a unique texture).\\n\\nI would recommend the strip or the Spinalis if you are in the mood for a more adventurous steak.\\n\\nSides:\\n\\nMUST TRY - Roasted corn with bacon (this is on another level)\\nThe English Pea succotash was just ok (good, definitely not great)\\nFrench Fries were wonderful (tasted like a homemade ketchup)\\nDifferent try the twice baked potato, but the sour cream on the side of it looked enticing.\\n\\nAll in all, a fabulous experience and I'm excited to go back to this Brookhaven neighborhood gem."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"By some miracle of God, 10 of us were able to get a last minute table here for dinner on a Saturday night! We were seated at a big round table in a quieter, more intimate dining room that had a few other tables. Ambience was nice, classy and dim-lit. Definitely a good date spot! \\n\\nThis restaurant features Peruvian tapas with small plates meant for tasting and sharing, as well as larger entrees. I tried the following:\\n\\n- Drinks: Sangria: it was a little too light and one-dimensional but pretty tasty. I felt like I was drinking juice. \\n\\n- Palta Rellena De Cangrejo: avocado stuffed with crab and topped with a poached prawn. This was so delicious!! Great combination of flavors and textures. My tastebuds were diggin it. Definitely my favorite dish of the evening. Get this!\\n\\n- Oysters: I tried two different kinds--I forget the names but they were both West Coast ones. I asked for something similar to Kumamotos (my fave) which are light and sweet and not too briney. Unfortunately, the oysters we got were a little brinier than I would have liked but it wasn't bad. Their mignonette did a great job of masking that ocean taste. \\n\\n- De Pescado \\"5 Elementos\\" Ceviche: I usually order ceviche any time I see it on the menu. This one was pretty good but it didn't blow me away and wasn't too memorable. Portions were definitely on the smaller side. \\n \\n- Lomo Saltado: I've definitely had better Lomo Saltado in LA. This one was a disappointment for me because I found it to be too salty. :( But it wasn't bad!\\n\\n*Side note: their complimentary bread is AWESOME! Especially with their three delicious dipping sauces! YUMMM! I loved it! \\n\\nService was a little slow and absent in the beginning... but it got better as the evening went on.

While you waiting to be seated you can grab a drink in the bar or enjoy cozy seating in the lobby. \\n\\n2. Ambience\\nReally quite elegant place. Music has classic accent which fits such a elegant stylish place. This place is perfect for romantic dinner, anniversary celebration, Valentines or just a fancy dinner.\\n\\n3. Design\\nI love this swanky Hollywood style design. Seating is really comfy because tables are far enough from each other. Me and my husband we enjoyed our privacy. \\n\\n4. Food & food quality \\nFood was amazing! We had pre set menu because it was dining month and this was the menu that I like most so we decide to go to Gracie\`s. \\n\\nStarters\\nEverything from starters was such a great experience. I'm really picky in food because I don\`t eat a lot of things but in this dishes I felt harmony. Combination of savory, sour and sweet flavors.Perfect!\\nI had avocado gulf prawns as a starter which was savory enough but avocado balanced this spicy taste. My husband had butternut squash soup with carrots which was really light and refreshing.\\n\\nMain course\\nSecond course was fantastic. Salmon with spinach puree which is one of my favorite. Berries and sauce in salmon balanced between sweet and salty taste. Great!!!\\nhusband took veal cheeks which was extremely soft and were melting on tongue. It came with square vegetables and nice salty gravy sauce.\\nDesserts!\\nChocolate cake is always winning dessert but hazelnut topping was great add to that. Mine was Raspberry Coulis also really good but a bit sweet for me. We were sharing both desserts with my husband and it was perfect solution.\\nMy berry cocktail was so good that I ordered it 2 times.( Fernet-me-Not)\\n5. Service\\nOur waiter Brandon was really pleasant and not hovering server. He explained everything what they have on their menu and he provided best service that I can ask for. I think he is really knowledgeable and he knows how to serve  \\n\\nThanks to Gracie\`s for such an amazing experience on our anniversary!
