Nothing in particular was wrong with it--a good balance of sweetness, creaminess, and chocolatiness--but it fell short of what my expectations for an $11 dessert an this uber fancy restaurant.

Dishes and cups were all branded with their logo. Had a good view of the kitchen and dimsum station behind a large glass window (more on this later). \\n\\nThe plates have very large rims however, and the rather small rectangular table got crowded quickly. I realize that the usual round tables in chinese restaurants are not the best looking but they work better with sharing style dining. The chopsticks were in a dark wood; was curious how they washed them as it was a sort of material that a dishwashing machine would destroy in a hurry. \\n\\n\\nDishes: \\n\\nStewed Pork - Arrived first and quite quickly. The meat was not tender and clearly needed to be simmered much longer. This dish is best when the meat melts in your mouth and it was the furthest from that sort of texture. \\n\\nChicken - Fried with sauce poured over. The plate was not the right shape for this dish (large rim, small deep bowl that's maybe better suited to saucey dishes) and made the portion seem smaller as a result. The sauce also tasted watery/not concentrated enough. \\n\\nFish Soup - Slow cooked soup with small fried fishes in it. Soup was very flavorful, one of the better dishes we had that day. Had to be careful with the bones though. \\n\\nSmoked Duck - Was supposed to be the appetiser but came dead last. Got the bonier parts of the duck. \\n\\nOverall the pacing of the dishes was all over the place. Strange that the stewed pork, which normally would take much longer time to prepare, came first. Long waits between dishes and it was hard to enjoy them all together as a full meal as you were getting them one at a time. They also only served red rice, no option for white rice! Fine if you're health conscious, but of course red rice will cost more. \\n\\nI found a bit of a contradiction between the restaurant's glitzy image and the food quality. Maybe it was partly the combination of dishes we got, but if I'm dining at a nice place with every bit of cutlery monogrammed to death, am I wrong to expect the meat to be deboned a little bit more? While I have no issues eating meat off bones, it can be awkward with chopsticks and I found the cooking rather unrefined for the image they seem to convey. There were multiple \\"garbage bowls\\" full of bones crowding up the already-too-small table. No one came to offer a plate change either until we waved someone down. \\n\\nIn any case the service was not warm. Got no reaction when thanking the servers for refilling water or bringing dishes etc. As we were leaving I also noticed a bowl of minced meat dimsum/XLB filling sitting on the dimsum station. As I said, we had full view from our table and not once during our meal did we see anyone working there. Makes you wonder how long that bowl of filling has been left there, and their general sanitation standards at all. \\n\\nGood to have tried for ourselves but we won't be back.

So now that I did, here's my thoughts.\\n\\nWhat I got:\\nMixed green salad $5\\nThe Blue Devil $9\\nSmall Fries, Regular $3\\n\\nHere's what I thought:\\n\\nMixed Green Salad:  $5 was a bit much for about 2 handfuls of mixed greens tossed in a lemon vinaigrette.  I could have bought 2 bags of mixed greens for that price at a farmer's market.  The lemon vinaigrette was SO acidic, I was left with cotton mouth.  Personally, I would have liked a little less dressing and maybe topping it with some fried onions or something.  But a plate of greens?  Not worth ordering.\\n\\nThe Blue Devil:  This was definitely a highlight.  Burger was about med-well.  I can't stress enough how refreshing it was to see the bleu cheese MELTED on my burger.  Most places just throw some crumbles on top, cold, right before serving.  The aioli was flavorful, the bacon smokey, and the fried onions gave it a great crunch.  An excellent burger.\\n\\nFries: Tasty enough, but I felt like I got the remnants of a frozen bag.  They were tiny fragments mostly, not full fries.  The sea salt was just enough.  It says they make their own potato chips....I wonder why they don't make their own fries? Handcut fries would have been so much better.  For the portion size and considering they're probably frozen...$3 was maybe overpriced.  I would be willing, however, to pay that much or even more for freshly handcut fries.\\n\\nI did not partake of the adult milkshakes (lactose intolerant) but would love to see them offer a soy or coconut ice cream/milk option for those.  My dairy sensitivities can handle a little bleu cheese, but not a whole milkshake, unfortunately.  \\n\\nAll and all, I'm a fan.  I will return.

I imagine the time it takes for people to finish their meal and all to be fairly quick since the menu is so small (literally just 3 ramen options and 1 appetizer). I went with the Tan Tan and the bf went with the Shoyu. Now, I don't know what constitutes as spicy for some but the Tan Tan definitely did not cut it for me. The broth just tasted very creamy and then oily once I swirled the spicy sesame oil in - I thought it was peculiar how it wasn't already mixed in. I know it states what's in each ramen but I was still sad that this specific dish didn't come with an egg. At $13, kind of expensive for how little you get in it. As for the Shoyu, I just tasted the broth and I think I'd prefer this over my own order.

Since the small plates run $8.50, that's $4.25 per skewer. Wow. Taste was okay but pretty much in line with a good chicken satay. The potato frittata was the best \\"deal\\" of the three we bought. It was a nice thick slice and did the most as far as quelling our appetite's reign of terror. Good subtle flavors and texture. Now, to the scallop dish. It was one single (substantial in size, granted) scallop with crispy onions on the top. One scallop. About the size of a marshmallow. $8.50. The flavor was nice but it was such a fleeting visit on my tastebuds. Scallop, we barely knew ye. \\n\\nI'm probably just a little too cheap for this place. If we'd have stuck to entrees instead, maybe our experience would have been much better. I was not blown away by any of the flavors (-1 star) and the portions were just too small to justify the price (-1 star). My wife and I were basically hungry about an hour later. I know this could have been overcome by throwing more money at the menu but it just didn't seem like we should have to do that, especially when told of the small plates suitability for 2 people. 2 small chicken skewers and a single scallop for a total of $17? Is it just me?"},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The crust is magic.  Chewy and half-baked on one side, crispy and fully cooked on the other.  The sauce is also a masterpiece of spices, garlic, and citric tomato.  I haven't had such a fantastic basic marinara since my addiction to Pinocchio's tomato & basil.  (But you have to go to Harvard Square to have Pinocchio's...).  You gotta try this place.\\n\\n\\"Detroit style\\" pizza is similar to Sicilian-style: pinky-finger-thick crust, and each pizza is a small, 8in by 8in 4-slice square.  They also take effort to make the crust chewy (Sicilian is more airy) and crispy on the bottom.  The result is definitely distinct from Sicilian and isn't nearly as thick as Chicago-style.  Via 313 also seems to put on a little more toppings and cheese than you'd get on a typical Sicilian.\\n\\nI got the rocket (soppressata, arugula, parmesan slices) and a marinara.  Both were roll-around-the-hotel-room-floor good.  The marinara was perhaps more memorable because their sauce is so spicy and complex.  Eating two at once was a bit of a splurge but I had ran 10 miles that morning.\\n\\nThe place is a bit of a walk from downtown but well worth it.

For our entr√©e, I ordered a swordfish steak while my girlfriend ordered bar steak. The swordfish sauce had a funky smell and a sour taste. was not a fan. The choice of side vegetables (some very bitter greens that kinda taste like kale, forgot the actual name), was poor. My girlfriend's steak was very tough. It was evident that a grade of beef that should not be used in an upscale restaurant like Two Urban Licks has been used to cut costs.

The extensive menu at NaraDeva boasts of a menu inspired by her mother's cooking, a few dishes from the streets of Thailand and some handed down by family generations.\\n\\nPricing might seem a tad higher when you glance at the menu, but the generous portions and fresh cooking seems justifiable.\\n\\nUnlike French cuisine, South Eastern cuisine cannot be given justice by skillfully presented photographs or eloquent writing. The savory-spicy flavors of Thai food have to be tasted to truly relish its worth. \\n\\nOnly on extremely rare occasions do I venture out to Indian restaurants outside of India simply because I cook Indian food and nothing remotely tastes even similar to what I am accustomed to having being raised in India. I can relate to the owner's commitment to maintain the sanctity of authentic Thai dishes, inspired by her mother's cooking. This being said short of taking a flight to Thailand, NaraDeva seems to be one of the rare places reminiscent of authentic style Thai cooking. \\n\\nFor all the people hooked on heat and complex yet comforting flavors Thai cuisine has to offer, NaraDeva is one restaurant I am pleased to endorse is worth the trek, regardless of which suburb of Orlando you reside in.

When we asked our waitress she said \\"oh yeah, we have soup, and some wraps, and ice cream too.\\" They didn't have any menus; she just forgot to mention it to us.\\n\\nToo late for soup, but we tried the ice cream. The only available flavor was mint which was okay. When they brought it, it was actually pink ice cream with little bits of green.

We also had the tune poke which was very well liked at the table but I didn't try it myself. Of course the cocktails were flowing as well and the specialty cocktails are quite good here as well and worth a try. \\n\\nFor dinner our group had the scallops which were fantastic...perfect crust on each side and they melted in your mouth...top two scallop dishes I've ever had; the duck fat poached swordfish, which was very tasty, but I thought lacking a bit of flavor; the halibut which was prepared perfectly and very good. The sides we ordered were the corn milk hush puppies which were delicious, but I didn't think they needed the sprinkle of powdered sugar on them at all, and the Brussel sprouts. I'm not a huge brussel sprouts fan but these were delicious and I would eat them again and again. \\n\\nFinally we split two desserts, the chocolate roulade and a coconut cookie/ice cream sandwich, which I don't recall the name of. They were both fantastic. The chocolate cake was perfectly moist and warm and the ice cream was a nice compliment. The coconut cookie had a great crunch on the outside and very soft on the inside.

You cannot save a table - you have to order first, then they will seat you. We thought for sure we'd be stuck without a table because of the amount of people ahead of us, but apparently the turnover is fast enough that it wasn't a problem. The line was still a bit long and wrapped around the really tight area, thus blocking the two bathrooms. We watched them cook as we waited, and I'll say they work rather quickly.

It's a bigger place by Portland standards and on the second floor of a building. It has a modern feel. We only had to wait 10 minutes or so to be sat but our waiter took at least 10 minutes to even greet us. When he came, he was very apologetic and spent the entire service trying make up for it which he did. My husband and I had some Sangria  which was fruity and delicious. For an appetizer, we had the fresh fish Cebiche and it was out of this world. My husband is from Chile, Peru's northern neighbor. He told me the food is very similar to his country so he ordered our entrees for us. I got the \\"Aji De Gallina\\" which is pulled chicken in a creamy sauce with rice and garlic and it was succulent. My husband ordered the \\"Lomo Saltado\\" which are beef tenders wok-fried with tomatoes, onions, oyster sauce, garlic and served with french fries. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. His only complaint was not enough french fries. It was served with 8 large fries stacked like a Jenga puzzle. He said in Chile and Peru, they like the sauce to soak into the fries so more would have been better but he loved his dinner. My daughter had a trio of \\"Empanadas\\" which are deep fried pastries filled with stuffing. One was beef with raisins, another was chicken and mushrooms, and the last one was spinach with mozzarela. My daughter devoured them. My husband and I liked them but we have had much better empanadas. They also brought out some treats from the chef which was a nice touch. One was some type of sashimi with a sauce and the other a potato and cheese thing. It was not on the menu so I can't be specific but they were tasty and much appreciated. Just as we ordered dessert, they also brought some complimentary cookies that were to die for.  Two lemon shortbread cookies filled with what my husband said was, \\"Manjar\\", which is when you heat up condensed milk and it turns to a type of caramel.Then came the Lucuma ice cream which is a fruit native to Peru and Chile and it was some of the best ice cream I have ever had.

It's an old elementary school restored and turned into a restaurant, bar, hotel, movie theater and more! \\n\\nLet's start with the movie theater. I've been here twice now and both times the movie cost me $4. That's an unbeatable price especially when you consider how relaxing and intimate the movie theater ambience is. Couches and small tables occupy the theater making it an extremely comfortable and intimate venue for seeing a flick. They have full concessions right outside the theater with beer, wine and a bunch of food too! A slice of pizza costs as much as as the movie ticket though. :(\\n\\nAfterwards, why not try out one of their many bars, 5 or so..Each with a slightly different feel to them.

It's super cute from the outside, and my first time peering in with Mamma and Mr. Mix by my side, we were compelled to go in for a taste test.\\n\\nPrime seating is at the original wooden bar where bowls of chowda' and icy plates of East Coast oysters are served up from the window display. It's picture perfect, and would make a great holiday setting, if it weren't for the food. Once you open your mouth, I'm afraid it's all downhill from there.\\n\\nThe clam chowder may be the worst I've had. I would be shocked if it wasn't processed gruel from Sysco or some similar industrial giant. The day we visited, they only had one type of oysters available: Blue Points...from LONG ISLAND. In a city of seafood, it made no sense to me that they would ship in oysters from New York. When Mr. Mix ordered their house made root-beer, he was dismayed to discover it was really just a generic, store-bought bottle branded with an Oyster House label.

The menu should have stated ...comes with a huge handful of shredded carrots and cilantro that overshadow any taste of crab whatsoever, you might as well order cardboard. \\n\\nGumbo had no crab...just more of those disgustingly chewy oysters and one shrimp. Roux was waaay too dark if that is possible so I am guessing this was the night before's dish. I will say that the french fries with malt vinegar aoili were delicious.\\nThat's it. I am sad because this place is half a mile from my husband's business and we love having lunch dates. It's back to JCT Kitchen and Canoe for quality. Trust me, go to Serpas' if you want a decent fried oyster. This is so not the place.\\n\\nThe wine was good. Pricey,but good. The day you see me pay 40 bucks for a dozen oysters on the half shell is the day I give up eating seafood for good. saw the lobster roll. It is the smallest thing I have ever seen, but I also saw the burger and it did look good. I have no idea how it tastes. Spent quite a bit for lunch to only like the fries.

We stayed here because I have a friend who lives nearby and recommended this to us.  Seemed kinda too corporate and bottom line to be posing as such hipsters artists to me.  The novelty of staying in a renovated elementary school wore off after the first night, bars were nothing special and neither was the beer, except for the Ruby Ale which I liked. Tastes are subjective I'll admit.  If I were a local, wouldn't visit this place with all the other beer options in town.  Don't think this was worth the price, but that's chance you take sometimes.  Oh yeah, they don't have TVs in the rooms, rooms are quite small and cramped for two people and luggage, the maids didn't clean our room the first day either (we didn't leave the service sticker in the door, but come on man), the soaking pool was closed (they did send us advance notification).  All the little things add up.  It's almost like they didn't want you to stay in the hotel at all during the day.

There were the aforementioned pickled vegetables, dried seaweed, fish cakes and bean sprouts. A lot of it was spicy, about at the limit I can handle. The fish cakes were very fishy, as was the pickled seaweed. Clearly they live and die by the sea and its contents. The dried seaweed was my favorite. It had a salty sweet taste and a fluffy, hairy, papery texture. The pickled tofu was good, the bean sprouts, the turnips. Most of it was very good, though I don't really like spicy stuff. I like fish but I don't like fishy stuff so I didn't like the fish cakes and wasn't crazy about the pickled seaweed. \\n\\nI forgot the name of the main dish I picked. It was noodles made with sweet potatoes, stir fried with vegetables and beef. It needed no condiments as it was cooked in a sauce that resembled teriyaki or soy sauce. The noodles were sort of clear and very squishy, almost gelatinous. When I bumped the plate, it all jiggled like a pair of surgically enlarged boobs.

I had my very first hotdog (on a bun) EVER right here at Frank! That's right. Growing up I never ate bread, I didn't like it. Turns out I have Celiac disease, so cool, who needs bread? And with all the gluten-free options available in today's world, I just never craved a GF hotdog bun. I have nothing against hotdogs, I promise. I'll eat them plain on a plate with some spicy mustard and relish, for sure. But when I sat down to eat at Frank with some good friends and saw GF hotdog buns on their menu, I thought, \\"what the hell.\\" And I totally went for it and I ate an entire hotdog on a bun! Or do you say \\"in\\" a bun? \\n\\nFirst of all, Frank was crazy busy during SXSW, duh. Good thing I squeezed into a seat at the bar and immediately ordered a fabulous Ginger Cherry Limeade cocktail. Pink, served in a mason jar, and super cute, one might say it's a pretty girlie drink. But whatever, it's delicious! It might taste like there's no liquor in it at all, but I watched them make it... don't worry.\\n\\nOnce we got a table, we ordered a second (or third?) round of drinks and some dogs. I went with the Red Headed Stranger for my libation; bacon infused vodka with Bloody Mary mix + a piece of bacon, cheddar cheese, a jalape√±o stuffed olive, and pepperoncini. Whoa! I actually opted for plain boring vodka instead of the bacon, because there was already bacon IN the drink itself. That's enough bacon for me!\\n\\nNow let's talk dogs! I ordered the Chili Cheese Dog, GF. I guess this is a classic. Hotdog, chili, bun. Pretty simple and pretty tasty. Hotdogs aren't the sort of food I crave or choose on my own to eat, but I'd say I had an awesome hotdog experience here at Frank. Not my favorite type of restaurant, but they do what they do well."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was in Austin for the weekend and tried Blue Dahlia for brunch on the suggestion of a local.  \\n\\nThe best thing about Blue Dahlia: the ambiance.  The place has a typical Austin vibe -- casual, quirky, charming, a little weird.  Definitely worth it if you're visiting from out of town and want to experience some Austin flavor.\\n\\nA good thing about Blue Dahlia: the food. I ordered a special that was off the menu that morning -- an egg frittata with sausages.  The dish was good and the serving was generous.  My friend ordered the roasted turkey tartine, which is pretty good, though not great.  \\n\\nThe not-so-good thing about Blue Dahlia: the service. My first brush with the service was at the counter, when I tried to order a coffee so I could get my caffeine fix while waiting for a table.  When I told the girl behind the counter that I wanted to order coffee, she curtly asked me to wait since she was busy.  She was obviously stressed, so I did my best to be nice to her.  Our waiter was much friendlier, but not very competent.  I ordered a serving of handmade bread to go with my frittata, and our waiter completely forgot about it.  When I later asked about my bread order, the waiter apologized for forgetting and offered to provide extra complimentary bread with my frittata.  He forgot about that as well.  \\n\\nFinally, the worst thing about Blue Dahlia:  the coffee.  Don't get it.  Unless you like watered-down coffee with no flavor.  So in sum, I'd recommend Blue Dahlia if you want to relax in a chill setting with good food, don't mind spotty service, and don't plan on having coffee with your meal."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"2973 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"This location is solid (like most CMGs), but the line is almost always out the door.

They all ordered Singapore Slings, so I tried to switch things up with a Corpse Reviver (bombay, orange liqueur, lillet and lemon) for $10. It was pretty light and sweet, but don't be fooled... I took a large gulp at one point and it wasn't as light as I originally thought.\\n\\nFood: \\nFirst came the complimentary White Cheddar Yorkshire Pudding. Oh. My. God. What is this heavenly manna? Its a fluffy and crispy godsend for sure.\\nThe menu breaks down the categories pretty easily:\\n\\"Starters\\": \\nPimento Hush Puppies - The plating made it look like Japanese Takoyaki. There was quite a bit of sauce for hush puppies, so definitely not the traditional. I liked the combination of the sauce with the spicy kick of the pimento cheese, though. Comes with 4.\\nDeviled Eggs - with pork rinds instead of the traditional bacon bits? Loved the concept. Comes with 4. Unfortunately, they seemed to have broken the salt shaker on this one and sprinkled on way too much salt. My friend got all dramatic that it was borderline inedible. I wouldn't say it was inedible, but I did suddenly feel my veins shrivel in dehydration...\\nRoasted Octopus - My friend ordered this one. The kitchen did a great job with the octopus, taking the tentacles and blackening them without burning. The octopus was tender and soft while crispy on the outside. I didn't really get the flavors of the additional garnishes, but that octopus though!!\\n\\"Garden\\":\\nBrussels Sprouts & Bacon - Very good, but as I mentioned to my table, how hard is it to mess up brussels sprouts? I've never had bad brussels sprouts eating out at a restaurant. The sherry vinegar got a little too strong toward the remnants of the dish.\\nRoasted Mushrooms - I saw marrow and mushrooms and I was hooked. The mushrooms were seasonal and roasted well. I disregarded the toast, just because I was already getting very full. The flavors worked well together, though.\\n\\"Hearth\\":\\n\\"The Duke\\" - the big ole burger that gets its namesake from the restaurant name (or vice versa?). I was expecting a huge burger (I mean... an $18 burger better be huge). But it was not. I was also not a fan of the pickle mayo. I love pickles and I love mayo. But for some reason, I just couldn't get into the pickle mayo. I wish I had asked for it on the side or had left it off altogether.\\n\\"The King\\" - two couples at the table ordered \\"The King\\" to share. I was intimidated by the $87 steak, so I avoided, but instantly regretted the second it was brought to the table. Perfectly medium rare ribeye steaks. There was jus on the side for more flavor, but I stole a bite and it didn't even need the jus. That meat was so tender and so flavorful. Nearly perfect. And that BONE MARROW? Wow. Super rich and flavorful, that it would be hard to finish an entire serving by yourself, for sure. \\n\\nWe didn't order dessert, but we got coffee, which seemed reasonably priced. They serve Counter Culture!\\n\\nOverall, it's a litttttle overpriced and a litttttle overhyped but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Also, while writing this review, I noticed the brunch menu on their website...

When I go to Home Slice, it is typically for dinner, however, I have been known to grab a couple of slices during lunch. The lunch rush is not too bad and if there is a line it usually passes expediently. For dinner, I usually grab something off of the Tried and True listing of popular pies on their menu. My favorite on this listing is the Rosted Red Pepper, Itallian Sausage, and Romano Cheese. When I order for dinner, I almost always get the garlic knots as they are out of control; sometimes I will get a double order. Last time I came here I tried the White Clam pie. It was interesting and came with lemon wedges but for now on I think I will stick to their pies that contain red sauce as it is just so damn flavorful.

A perfect combination of rice, refried beans, salsa, guac, sour cream, queso fresco, and impeccably barbequed chicken, rolled in a warm, freshly griddled tortilla. Served with salsa and chips for $8. Never in my life have I been served such a well constructed burrito. Absolutely NO mess. No hot sauce dripping out the bottom. Ingredients evenly distributed throughout, and to emphasize again, a warm, homemade griddled tortilla. Absolutely delicious. I am not at all sorry to say that I shall no longer venture to Anna's for a burrito during Mixtura's business hours. Mixtura wins, by a long, long shot.\\n\\nOn to the brunch:\\n\\nI believe it to be the best in the Somerville/Cambridge area at the moment, simply due to the quality of ingredients, care in preparation, and friendliness of service. We arrived with 6 people on a Sunday and they were happy to push together 2 tables for us. We ordered:\\n\\n--French Toast with blueberries and mango: as others have noted, amazing . The mangoes are caramelized in cognac. Nuff said.\\n\\n--Mexican Omellette: homemade chorizo, fantastic.\\n\\n--Salvadoran Omellette: OMG the plantains....\\n\\n--Inca Omellette: Where the hell else can you get a quinoa-sweet potato omellette for $8.50? My favorite.\\n\\nEverything was cooked to perfection, and the sides were fantastic. Get some extra  home fries. Our coffee was constantly refilled throughout the meal, and our waiter was pleasant, friendly, and accommodating. \\n\\nAt the end of the meal they brought us a plate of traditional dulce de leche cookies with dabs of a special type of Peruvian honey. It was at that point that we all sort of fell in love with Mixtura, in a very, very real way. For the rest of the day, all that the six of us could seem to talk about was how delicious our breakfast was, and how much we loved Mixtura, and how much we wanted to go back, all the time, and tell everyone we know about it. I have never written an extensive Yelp review, and often resent people who ramble on such as I have in this writeup, but I was seriously that impressed with my Mixtura experience that it merits this long of a review.  Even if its empty, go, sit by the window, support these wonderful people preparing this wonderful, wonderful cusine. ¬°Viva Peru!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a bit overrated. The cereal they sprinkle on some donuts usually tastes super stale."},{"name":"XLB","address":"4090 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Shanghai soup dumplings should be a delicious and terrifying experience.  The perfect soup dumpling is a tiny parcel of savory pork just bursting with scalding hot broth that threatens to strip away all semblance of intact mucosa in your mouth.  The ideal skin is supple and thin.  Picking up a soup dumping should be a delicate affair.  There should be a large soup spoon ready to slip underneath the dumpling should the bottom begin to sag and give under the weight of the symphony of pork broth contained within (spillage of said broth should result in much shame and regret).  That first bite should unleash a cascade of umami and richness filling the mouth with an explosion of porky goodness, just balanced out by a hint of acid from the vinegar and ginger dipping sauce.  Unfortunately, these dumplings were none of those things.  Don't get me wrong: They were decent enough non soup dumplings.  If they were sold as \\"dumplings\\" I would probably give this place an extra star.  But when you try to sell a Shanghai soup dumpling to a guy from Shanghai, there are certain expectations to be met; and this place fell far short. \\n\\nTo start, the dumplings visually were an uneven affair.  A hodgepodge of assorted shapes and sizes which, aside from being unappealing to look at, indicated different degrees of cook (since a large dumpling will finish cooking more slowly).  True to expectation, the smaller members of this motley dumpling crew were dry and rubbery.  I could have speared one with a harpoon and not worried about spilling the precious broth within, because there was none to be had.  The largest one had a small amount of soup inside, but even that one was a far cry from what I was expecting.  Contrast these with the dumplings I recently enjoyed at Seattle's Din Tai Fung where the dumplings are evenly sized and bursting at the seams with broth, and the entire event at XLB is just sad. \\n\\nWe also got the duck baozi which were a sad, soggy, mushy riff off of peking duck bao.   A normal peking duck bao is a perfect balance of soft pillowy steamed buns with tender roast duck meat and crispy skin topped with fresh scallions and tangy hoisin sauce.  A real peking duck bao is a riot of textures and flavors and should induce tremendous pleasure and guilt and a small amount of concern for one's coronary arteries.  The ones at XLB could be eaten through a straw, and were muddled in flavor and texture.  It was just mushy sweet stuff mixed with mushy salty stuff crammed into an oversteamed bun.  Very disappointing.\\n\\n\\nWe also got pork and cabbage baozi (way too salty), sauteed chinese greens (too bland -- needed ginger, garlic, salt and a hit of MSG), and tofu and sausage (a poorly balanced mess with too much acid).  The green beans were decent.  They were well cooked and nicely balanced with a touch of the schezuan peppercorn for that wonderful \\"ma-la\\" flavor that is so quintessentially schezuan.  Could have used a little more oil -- they did seem dry.  \\n\\nThe tea was wonderful.  Both the green and the jasmine tea are light and floral and aromatic.  No excessive bitter tannin flavors from oversteeping.  The tea and the beans dragged this place up half a star (but you can't do half star ratings on yelp, so I rounded up). \\n\\nOverall, this place is acceptable if you've never had a soup dumpling.  If you're looking to wash down gummy and uneven dumplings with excellent tea, this is an fine place to spend your money.  As for me? I'm saving my funds to go towards gas money for my next trip to Din Tai Fung."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Love poor calvin's it's my go to brunch place (well since park's edge closed).

Frankly though, that comparison does neither any favors given how diametrically opposite the two restaurants seem.\\n\\nYume wo Katare has long lines that snake outside the restaurant and patrons are shuffled in; singles most frequently, couples next, and groups rarely. Santouka takes your number down and both texts and calls you when your table is free. Yume's tables are reminiscent of a bar: you always sit aside your fellow diners but never across and their tables are wooden. Santouka has a modern restaurant feel and your group of four doesn't have to shout left to right since they use more traditional tables.\\n\\nThe ramen too, is vastly different. Where Yume wo Katare shouts and screams, full of flavor, texture, and umami, Santouka's is quietly solid. Yume's ramen is frequently too salty, too flavorful, too greasy, too much garlic. Santouka's almost seems machine-made: too perfect in its construction and without any of the frills. I would not go as far as to call Santouka's ramen boring since it is so good, but I feel it suffers from a lack of excitement or pizzazz.\\n\\nReally, which one you consider better boils down to personal preference.

I ordered three tacos with my three favorite meats: grilled steak, grilled chicken, and al pastor (which they call \\"spicy pork\\" on their menu).  Every order comes with chips and salsa, and the salsa had a mellow (not overwhelming) spiciness which I liked.  OK, those tacos were really good. . .all three of them.  I could tell that the ingredients were of good quality.  The steak was lean and flavorful.  The chicken consisted of chunks of non-gristly white meat.  The al pastor had chunks of pineapple in it.  All three meats were nicely grilled and browned.  I like to try many different taquerias in town and, really, most tacos are kind of about the same. . .average.

Tonight we dined and had one of the worst dining experiences of our lives. My husband and I are parents so we have to make our plans pretty far ahead of time and hire a babysitter. When we arrived to the restaurant we were seated in this cold basement room that I never knew existed. We did have reservations and previously we were always seated upstairs in the past, thus I never knew you needed to request certain seating areas. When we arrived there were plenty of tables left upstairs as well, so not sure why they made us sit down there. The room was cold and the ambiance not the same. You can't hear the live music and the lighting is too bright (not romantic in the least). Additionally, we were seated next to a screaming baby and a loud bridal party. I felt so bad for the screaming baby who was obviously with the nanny while the parents were dining upstairs. By the time the mother finally came down to comfort the baby (45 minutes-1 hour later), two other couples sitting in our section had left due to the noise. I literally felt like applauding when the poor baby stopping screaming. The baby was probably around 9 months old and the nanny didn't even pick her up! On to the food, our appetizers took about 20 minutes to come out and were tasty as usual. Our main entrees however took over an hour after that and lacked the pizazz we have experienced in the past.

Still not vegetarian.\\n\\nBest/worst moment of the meal:  Vegetarian friend, who is now clearly established with the server as a vegetarian, orders cheese waffle fries.  The order comes back as waffle fries loaded with cheese and bacon.  Server realizes the order's wrong, takes the bacon fries away, comes back and tosses them on the table and says we can just eat them anyway, THEN comes back again and takes them away because it's actually an order for a different table.  Punchline is when we get the order of waffle fries with no cheese.\\n\\nHonestly thought we were on some kind of episode of Punk'd because the service was so ridiculous.

This is my favorite restaurant in Boulder, if not overall. I would be more than happy to eat the arugula salad, quattro formaggi pizza, and budino every day.

I can't speak for the meaty pizzas, but the margherita, bianca, and funghi pizzas are spectacular. I also highly recommend the arancini (fried rissoto, saffron, and bufalo mozzarella balls)--they're an incredible start to the meal.\\n\\n2. Regarding the 'thin, soggy pizzas': Comparing Napoleon-style pizza to Chicago-style, New York-style, or delivery-style pizza is pointless. Napoleon pizza is meant to be thin, and it will absorb the moisture from the sauce. It's meant to be eaten with a knife and fork; it's not meant to be stiff enough to eat by hand. If you are looking for thick crust American pizza, this place might not be for you. BUT, if you are looking for some truly incredible flavors and food that bests the pizzerias of Italy, come here, and come hungry. \\n\\n3. I can't help but laugh at the folks (specifically Jodie K. from Denver) who are mad that there wasn't plain pizza for their kids: the Yelp account reads \\"Good for kids?

The interior of restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing, with the large windows letting in tons of light on this early morning I decided to stop by.\\n\\nMy friend and I had been hearing about the infamous cake table through a variety of food blogs and decided to check it out.  It was ~$10 for a variety of desserts and pastries so we decided to try it out.\\n\\nThe cake table when we went had hazelnut chocolate cake, cinnamon bun, key lime pie doughnut, berry muffin, lemon cloud cookies, vanilla spice cake, triple espresso cookie, among a variety of other desserts.  My personal favorite was the cinnamon bun, as it just melted in your mouth, but pretty much all the desserts were extremely tasty as well.\\n\\nIn addition to the cake table, we wanted to try some of the savory dishes, in particular the Fried Chicken and Waffles ($18), which was my personal favorite out of everything I tried at Townsman.

Seriously, kicking myself. I remember running by this place a couple of years ago and saying to myself.. \\"must try and somehow it fell off my radar.\\n\\nLast week,  the boss and a colleague were in town and they like to go to Zagat rated restaurants and I usually just stick with my Yelp recommendations but they picked Anis. I was really happy as I recalled wanting to try it anyway.  \\n\\nAs far as the service, it started off kinda choppy.  My boss ordered a bottle of wine, and he looked at him and says, \\"Is she going to be drinking, because I need to see her ID.\\"  He didn't even say it to me! Wow!  Instead of being annoyed, I took it as a compliment as I am many moons over age 21 so it was all good.  As the wine came he asked who wanted to try it and as I  know a tad about wine my boss suggested I try it.  I took my time and swirled it, smelled it, and sipped it while the waiter just looked at me. I have no idea why I find so much  humor in typing this.  I wish could remember the name of the red wine but it sure was tasty.\\n\\nIt was  Tuesday night and they have a prixe fixe menu for 35..00 which was excellent. I got the frog legs,  duck leg for dinner, and a blackberry crisp for dessert.  The frog legs were pretty well prepared in a white wine  sauce with parsley.  The duck leg with veggies melted in my mouth. It was perfection. The blackberry crisp is a tart dessert served with ice cream and I give it a 3.5.  We got a cheese plate for the table and it was five star. It made me want to get an empty suitcase, get on the first plane to Provence and stock up!\\n\\nThe live French music was awesome.  The sign says the music is on Thursdays and Fridays but it might be every night. I think I am going to put Anis into a monthly rotation.

The meals are full course, so everyone starts with a salad, then you pick your appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. I remember ordering the Chef's Special, which was a shrimp omelette. The shrimp did not taste fresh, which was disappointing seeing as how it costs a pretty penny for the meal. However, the rest of the meal was okay.

The food was okay, but not worth the price (I'd choose Ruth Chris or Capital Grill over Top of the Hub).\\n\\nHere was my main issue: unless you sit at a table against the window, you cannot get a decent picture. Our waitress was nice enough to take one for us, but it showed us, another couple behind us, and then a sliver of the skyline (not something we are going to frame). Walking around we saw two adjacent tables against the windows and asked a waitress if we could take a picture, but she said no because we didn't have those seats and it would disturb the guests sitting by the window (the closest guest was ~5-6 feet away). Upon asking the maitre d'hotel , he, again, with an extremely rude, dismissive tone said we can only take pictures at the table we had and gave us a look as to leave.

Great coffee, delicious food, plenty of outlets, comfortable seating (and plenty of it), friendly workers, and other people doing work. \\n\\nFOOD: The pastry list is incredible, and they taste incredible. I've had macaroons, the key lime tart, chocolate tart, fruit tart, and chocolate. I have NEVER been disappointed. For \\"real\\" food, I've had the strawberry, goat cheese, and candied almond salad (a la carte, $7.49, + $2 for protein) and I really, really liked it. I most recently ordered a tartine, the fig, bacon, and brie one ($4 for a half, $6 for a full). The bread was great -- very good texture, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. The brie with the fig and bacon was a good flavor combination, but a little heavy on the fig. Overall, I think the prices for food/dessert are pretty reasonable, especially considering the quality. \\n\\nAMBIANCE: Eclectic. The place has a very unique vibe, which I really enjoy. It's not quite trendy/hipster, more like smart/weird/quirky. There's framed needlework all over, along with mirrors, paintings, hanging plates with faces of classic French artists (I think??), at least 7 fairly odd chandeliers, and none of the furniture matches. There is however, a TON of furniture. Lots of wooden tables and chairs, but also several couches and arm chairs. It attracts a wide crowd, which I like because it's not dominated by snobby hipsters. \\n\\nSERVICE: It's seat yourself and order at the counter, but they give you a number and bring you your food. Everyone I've interacted with here has always been very pleasant. \\n\\nOVERALL: Love this place. I do wish they had some outdoor seating, but still definitely my favorite cafe in Atlanta for doing work, particularly on a rainy day. And I do a lot of work as a graduate student. If you're looking for a place to get some work done while also sipping on coffee or nibbling on some delicious pastries, this place is for you.\\n\\nTIP: Tons of parking!

Donuts went anywhere from a little less than $2 to over $5 a donut, depending on how big or wacky it was. My boyfriend's favorite was the infamous maple syrup bacon donut. I myself loved the donuts with oreos on them the best. The voodoo donut was an interesting concept, but was simply a plain jelly donut with chocolate icing, which I am not personally a fan of. Overall, my brother, boyfriend, and dad got excited and ended up buying 4 dozen donuts, which probably took a lot of time and didn't make the line go by any faster.

The garage doors were open when we were seated and we froze our behinds off for the first 5 minutes of sitting...literally shaking as I didn't realize I would need a coat in a restaurant (we had valet' d the car ).

His name was CRIMSON (which is so very cool like him).  He was upbeat, very personable and attentive.  He definitely made the experience nice!  We had the calamari appetizer which was huge, had a yummy sauce on it...and was very filling.  We also had the tuni tartar appetizer...which was a little bland for our tastes.  I had the  Scallops (which came with a gouda grit side)....and who couldn't love cheese grits...IT'S THE SOUTH!!!  My date had the chicken and he seemed quite pleased as well.

I try to keep a balanced view of my restaurants and read several reviews before darkening the restaurant's doorway. In the case of the Union Oyster House, there are myriad reviews to consider. Since there is a true dichotomy about how people feel about this place, here's my take. There is always going to be a bad meal or a surly server if you go to any one place enough times, and I sensed that some of the negative reviews were based on a one-time only visitation which is, of course, an unfortunate way to be introduced to a restaurant. So since I have now have had a one-time only visitation, I can say that I experienced none of the negatives. The traditional cornbread was very good and warn, and I was given more upon request. My wife's cocktail passed her discriminating tastes, and my seasonal draft beer was great. Our main courses (my wife had grilled shrimp rather like a shrimp scampi, and I had Boston scrod) were well presented and very tasty. To be also mentioned was the gingerbread cake (with ice cream) which was really nice and appropriate for the holiday season. We sensed that our server was one who had worked there for quite some time, and she was pleasant and helpful. We will return.  (I would recommend reservations to avoid waiting.)"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Literally love this place.

Its name describes it. . .the patty is a bit thicker that many others, and that extra thickness keeps if from getting completely dried out like many others.  Also, the lettuce on it is crispy (rather than all limp) and there are two generous slices of tomato.  On top of that, the bun is a brioche style bun, which has a nice buttery taste.  I think Carl's Jr.'s Thickburger beats out all other fast food burgers.

The garlic infused sauce is incredibly flavorful and the same can be said about just about all their stir fry sauces. Vegetable fried rice are tasty here as well and their drinks are very refreshing; the Thai iced tea packs in a lot of cool flavor while the guava smoothies are a very popular option for the summer. Service can be a bit slow as they bring your meal in installments due to staffing limitations in the kitchen.

One of those moments came today with the suggestion from my daughter that we have lunch at Home Slice.  It is close to where she works, and she swore to us that it's the best pizza ever.  By golly, I have to agree with her - the crust was perfect, the toppings fresh, and it wasn't greasy at all.  I had the pepperoni and mushroom which was delish, and I tasted her spinach slice which was equally good.  Her BF had a meatball sandwich which he said he would order again too.  The waiter was friendly and attentive, and the food arrived quickly even though the place was packed.  If only I had stayed only with pizza, I would have given it 5 stars.  But I ordered caesar salad, and there was something weird going on with the caesar dressing that I didn't like.  Therefore:  Pizza - 5; Salad - 3; Average - 4.

My friends and I love coming here when it is a lot of us because you can order 2-4 dishes to share and everyone will be full to their heart's content. This time around, it was just my friend and I so we decided to order 2 dishes: seafood pan fried noodles and pork fillet.  I pretty much always order seafood pan fried noodles because they are generous with the amount of seafood and Bak Choy they mix in the dish. I especially love the crunch to the noodles for added texture. The only thing is that during this visit the pan fried noodles I ordered were slightly burnt-- not a big deal because it actually added a toasty taste, but something to be noted if you're looking for consistency of dishes.  The pork fillet had a nice and crispy texture, though lacking in flavor and seasoning. I would definitely recommend going for more of your classic Cantonese staples because they surely make those really well!  \\n\\nCustomer service here can be a hit or miss--during our most recent visit, we were not given water and had to actively seek out a server multiple times to bring us some. I am also a bit wary of the cleanliness and sanitation here after seeing them dump a huge pile of green beans on an empty dining table out front for peeling without using a table cloth (who knows how clean those tables are) or containers. \\n\\nWith that said, the appeal of this place is truly the value of getting good food (and a lot of it at that) for a fair price.

The butter lettuce salad was not fresh and the salad dressing was nothing notable to really justify the almost 10 dollar charge. Poutine was also disappointing. It just had a lot of gravy and some cheese curds but overall lacked flavours. My dining partner ordered sloping hill pork (?) and I ordered lamb cheeks which was they day's special. Both were quite good, the lamb cheeks were very tender though it had a bit too much of the lamb taste/smell....Where the restaurant really wowed me was the dessert. The lemon meringue pie with lightly browned surface was amazing! Not too sweet or sour but just enough citrus to cleanse the palette especially after the lamb!

I was psyched to try it because banh cuon is one of my favorite vietnamese dishes and it's hard to find because it's a breakfast item and most vietnamese restaurants don't carry it. \\n\\nI was expecting the restaurant to have a long list of different banh cuon (rice crepe eaten with or without a filling) but they only have two different types. One is served \\"dac biet\\" (special style) and the other is plain (without the extras). They did have a complete vietnamese menu which includes rice dishes, bun dishes (vermicelli), goi (salad), pho (beef and chicken based), hu tieu (another type of noodle soup), banh uot (rice crepes a little bit different than banh cuon) and banh hoi (angel hair vermicelli served with grilled meats and vegetables).\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n-for an appetizer the nem noung cuon (summer rolls with nem nuong which is a kind of grilled seasoned ground pork)\\n-for main dishes the banh cuon dac biet, bun cha gio thit nuong (vermicelli with spring rolls and grilled pork), and pho ga (chicken pho)\\n-for drinks che sam bo luong (a dessert drink) and iced coffee with condensed milk \\n\\nThe banh cuon, the house specialty, were pretty good. The crepes were fairly thin (they generally taste better when the crepes are on the thinner side) and filled with ground pork and sliced wood ear mushrooms (both types of banh cuon served here are filled with the ground pork mixture). They were served with gio (a kind of vietnamese pork terrine), yam tempura (strange and nothing like the japanese kind. the yams were grated, battered and fried) and something I was told was banh cong (a weird fried shrimp cake which I didn't care for at all). I could have done without the extras because the best thing on the plate was the banh cuon.\\n\\nThe nem nuong cuon were decent. You get two rolls filled with lots of vegetables but not as much nem nuong. The bun cha gio thit nuong was also very good and tasted pretty standard (it's when it tastes \\"off\\" that I would be concerned).  However, I didn't care for the pho ga. It had a weird \\"gaminess\\" to it if you can have that with chicken. I think that's because they serve it with various chicken parts other than just chicken breast.\\n\\nThe restaurant also has a long list of drinks which include dessert drinks which are often eaten with the meal instead of at the end. Che sam bo luong is one of those drinks. It's hard to explain but I think there's seaweed, mung bean and gelatin in the drink. It's one of a few vietnamese dessert drinks that don't have coconut milk in it. It was good but a bit on the sweet side for my taste. The iced coffee with condensed milk was perfect though. Ask for it \\"to go\\" and it'll be served in a plastic cup with a straw so that if you don't finish it at the restaurant you can take it with you. \\n\\nThe service was attentive. There was only one server with many people in the kitchen but it wasn't a problem. \\n\\nI would definitely come back, especially for the banh cuon.

Word of advice is start figuring out what kind of doughnuts you want because the line moves really fast!!

While the doughnut was good , the jam was okay.\\nMaple blazer blunt- Looks like a blunt with maple flavoring and no you cannot smoke it\\nDiablos Rex- Is a doughnut with a pentagram for those who like to summon a partner eating with them.

It is a calm and neat environment perfect for a casual lunch or dinner setting. They have their menu signs in the same format as Chipotle with entrees of salads, pastas, and wraps with a set price for under 8 dollars. They also have a ScoutMob right now so that would be half price so under 5 dollars, great deal!\\n\\nAnyways, you pick what style entree you what and you pick your meat/sauce to start. They have meatballs, grilled chicken, salmon, and breaded chicken. They have a few different sauce such as your regular marinara, a spicy version marinara, and alfredo. Then you get to choose all your toppings/vegetables to add on top and finally finish it off with cheese. They also have a few different types of breadsticks that you can order on the side. Personally, I got a salad and they have a few different dressings such as balsamic and pesto. Right next to the self-serve drink machines, they have parmesan cheese, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar if you need more flavor. \\n\\nThe portion sizes are medium sized, smaller than that of Chipotle but for relatively the same price. The meal was decent but felt awesome considering I spent less than 5 bucks using ScoutMob. I am not sure if I would pay the normal price for the same meal because it didn't impress me but seemed to be average.

They always change up their menu and it's filled with really interesting, delicious healthy food. This is a great place to check out when you're getting bored of the same old places/food. They do an amazing job of sourcing seasonal food and the ingredients are always very fresh. They have a fantastic sommelier/bartender who has introduced us to some really interesting wines that I would never have discovered on my own. They carry very cool wines - stuff from all over the place and some very funky variety - love that about this place. They do this thing where they offer several courses. I'd advise following that setup as much as your diet allows because it's going to be delicious and it ends up being a very enjoyable experience because you end up trying foods that you might not normally try. For me, that's stuff like soup, or desert. However, they are always very accommodating to my dietary restrictions and they don't make me feel weird about not following their standard drill if it doesn't work for me for any reason. This place is definitely snug. I think it adds to the charm. Even though the seating is not something that would typically ever work for my husband's back, we always seem to get in and out without injury or indescribable pain. This isn't a place where we find ourselves chatting over a glass of wine after dinner for an hour. It is kind of an eating experience. You go to eat - you're seated on time, served in a timely manner and never ignored by the waitstaff. You drink if you're into that kinda thing, have desert and get on your merry way. It's about the food and drink, although having good company doesn't hurt. ;) It's a good place to go for a fun dining experience that's a little different from other places around town. Since seating is at a premium, it's good for small groups or pairs. Definitely make a reservation. The wait occurs outside at this place. I think they now serve drinks outside though at this little outdoor cantina setup they have going on, which is pretty cute. Speaking of cute, this place is adorable. They have some parking and the decor, inside and out, is fun/interesting all the way down to the restrooms.

Since the sign went up I've been looking forward to trying this place, especially since I am a firm believer in the flavor you get from cooking with charcoal. I had the 1/4 chicken (excellent) with two sides and a drink 7.99 and tres leches (excellent) 3.25. On a subsequent visits I've tired the yuca fries (good), rice (good), black beans (good), mac & cheese (good) and flan (OK)\\n   I have also ordered their family meal $21, a whole chicken and two large sides, to take over to a friends. I'm happy to say everyone was really impressed with the food. It's enough to feed 4 moderate appetites or 3 big ones.\\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe chicken was very good, juicy and tender with lots of flavor. The only problem I had with it was it was a little salty for me. If you like or don't mind salt this probably wouldn't bother you but for me I thought it got in the way of tasting the other seasonings they had used on the meat. \\n   Reluctantly, I went back to the counter to order the tres leches for desert, I say reluctantly because I felt sure I'd be disappointed. Who expects to get decent tres leches at a fast food restaurant? When I ordered, was informed it was made by a local bakery. It was VERY good! Sweet and moist without being soggy or overly sweet.\\n   On a later visits I have tied the yuca fries, black beans, rice and mac & cheese sides, all are very good. Actually, exceptionally good. The only way I'd expect to get better sides than these is if I was at a sit down restaurant paying two or three times more.\\n   Their staff has always been friendly and eager to be of service. One time I went in to pick up the family meal they didn't have any chicken ready and said it would be about 10 minutes. They were accurate in their time estimate and gave those of us who were waiting a free Inca Kola to drink while we waited, a very nice touch. Another time they suggested trying 1/2 black beans and 1/2 rice for a side. Without hesitating I agreed. Despite this, they mixed up a small sample to make sure I'd like it before putting it on my plate. That level of service is rare, even in a full restaurant, let alone at a fast food establishment. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\nThe mashed potatoes had an odd flavor that I didn't care for. It was like it had picked up some flavor from whatever they had been stored in.\\n   \\n\\nThe Indifferent:\\nI tried their flan on a later visit, and although there was certainly nothing wrong with it, it wasn't anything special either."},{"name":"Original Joe's Restaurant & Bar","address":"11080 No. 5 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Great service, friendly atmosphere, good crowd for the game and WOW the beer selection.\\n\\nHad the wings and double dog sandwich.

A great appetizer to share, and good portion size for only $8. I had the Plancha Burger, which I rank as one of the best burgers in Austin, especially for only $9. The patty had a little bit of bacon ground into it, and was very good. And it's clear the pastry chef know's what she's doing, since the Challah bun was outstanding.

The restaurant is small, intimate for some, crowded for others.  If you are looking for an establishment that provides patrons personal space, Paramount may not be for you.  You will be very close to others, in some cases sharing tables with other patrons.  \\n\\nParamount has the feel of a warm diner that is quite busy and is situated in the heart of Beacon Hill.  The food is comfort food that is notches higher than your average diner.   I was hoping to try their lobster mac and cheese since nothing screams comfort and warmth on a cold day than that.  However, they were out of that dish along with the homestyle chicken which was a disappointment when you can't get what you want.  \\n\\nWe chose the French onion meatballs as an an appetizer, they were fantastic.  All the qualities of French onion soup infused with meatballs, I would recommend to anyone that is a fan.\\n \\nI settled for the barbecue steak tips served with grilled asparagus, mashed potatoes, and onion rings on top.  The plating of the dish was excellent as were the sides, the portion size was extremely generous.  The steak tips were cooked to my specifications, the only knock was the barbecue sauce and felt it took away from the steak itself and was a bit overpowering and not subtle enough.  \\n\\nThe ambience was a nice change from other Beacon Hill venues, food was solid and will definitely have to go back to try what I wanted to have in the first place."},{"name":"Arby's","address":"4950 S Cobb Dr SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"Literally writing this sitting in the drive through.

I met 4 friends there and we had some seating issues because we added one more person.  They wouldn't allow us to add a chair to the end of the table so, they moved them around a few times, told them we may have to wait another 30 minutes and then finally figured it out with the assistance of my friends boyfriend!  The interior is modern and chic and there is a decent size porch if you enjoy al fresco dining.  Please note you have to be seated at the bar top unlike most other restaurants where you can just walk in, sit and avoid the wait.\\n\\nOur additional person and I finally arrived and we joined them at our new table.  \\nI opted for a bloody mary (3.5 stars) in true brunching fashion!  The juice blend was homemade and was the perfect blend of spicy and I will cure your entire hangover ailment.  I just wish the garnishes would have been plentiful.\\n\\nHanger Steak with anchovy and kale butter (5 stars):  Have you ever had a dish that made all of your taste buds come alive at once?  If you haven't you should try this because it's something you should experience.  You have the creamy butter, the bite of the anchovy and the taste of top quality and well cooked beef flavor blending together to dance on your palette.  At first I was turned off by reading about the anchovy on it but, it really gave the topping a blend of the best flavors from a ceaser salad.  It was surprising to me how that flavor gave the dish the one pop it needed to balance perfectly together.\\n\\nBean Salad (5 stars):  This was served on the side of the steak and it absolutely blew me away with the creative flavor combinations and the perfectly cooked beans.  The sauce on it was in part creamy but, then it had what I think was some type of creamy mustard as well.  It was melt in your mouth good, creative and the unimaginable compliment to all the flavors of the steak.  \\n\\nThe complex flavor pairings of the steak and the bean salad could have gone horribly wrong with such diversity but, I love a bold approach to so many flavors that somehow works and makes you say WOW how did that happen or I can't believe that actually worked!\\nFried Chicken with coriander slaw and pickles (3 stars):  They don't give you the option of light or dark meat and I was figuring we would be served one of each but, it was all dark meat.  That being said of course it was juicy and the breading was ok but it really could have used more flavor.  The coriander slaw was just ok and I would have liked to see a creamier flavor to compliment the fried chicken more.  Unfortunately I was not a fan of the pickles because to me they were too vinegar based and should have had a little more dill to offset that full solitary flavor.\\n\\nThis place is a bit pricey on the brunch side of things but, well worth it if you order the right item.

So often the chicken dish in a fancy place is dumbed down it seems to keep the less adventurous happy, but for once the dish both sounded amazing (came with a pisco-based sauce) and lived up to its hype.  Well done, Andina!\\n\\nThe service was also top notch - our server was happy to make recommendations that turned out to be splendid.  And the hostess let us know when we showed up at 6:30 pm on a Sunday that while we did not have a reservation they could give us a table until 8 pm if that was ok - which I think was a nice touch since being asked to leave before dessert would have been a little off-putting.

We drove from Denver for my birthday and decided to have dinner at Leaf, since it is one of the few vegan restaurants in Boulder. I really want to keep this review short. So as we were seated, they put silverware and some plates on our table. One of the plates had a chunk of food stuck in it. \\"Yummy\\"! Had to ask to replace it. The service was very slow, but finally our server came to get our orders. She couldn't hear the word I was saying and was asking me to repeat myself all the time. Made me feel uncomfortable. We ordered raw flatbread which was on happy hour, miso soups, and entrees of tofu/tempeh and rice. Raw flatbread was gross. The oil was dripping from it. I am a vegan/ raw vegan food chef myself, have been eating raw for a while, and that was just a bad raw dish. The soup was extremely SALTY. The entree....I just liked the oyster mushrooms. The rice and tempeh were swimming in some kind of salty broth and didn't taste good at all. Our server didn't come once to ask how we were doing, and even after we finished our meal, placed silverware on our plates, leaned back on our chairs, it took her at least 10 minutes to realize that we are done. Well, I don't even know if this place serves desert! Because no one asked us if we wanted desert, nor gave us desert menus. Got a check, raw flatbread was full price on it. I know that it is not a big deal, and easily fixed, but the service was extremely slow and we just wanted to leave already! So she went back, fixed it, thanks. And even then the total came up to $60.

You can get more thoughtfully prepared food with larger portions at other places around town, both Dai Due and Salty Sow are better picks for dining east of 35. I will say that the server was very attentive to an allergy issue my wife has and we were both really happy about it. Overall this place seems sloppy and the menu is unfocused. It's some mishmash of French, American-Southern, Mediterranean, and Indian. It's all over the place and overly ambitious. Below are a few notes. \\n\\n1. We waited outside for our table and ordered a cocktail. It took 30 mins to get our drinks and 3 mins later our table was ready. Other people received their drinks before us who had ordered after we did. Not a huge deal, but just shows a lack of ability to prioritize and process tickets in the correct order.\\n\\n2.  The portions are tiny. I'm not a huge eater and portions are not an issue I've come across in Austin ever. But, we paid $18.00 for a single octopus tentacle with some greens. It was a joke. They served it on a big plate so I guess that's why it's not an appetizer? \\n\\n3. We ordered a rabbit terrine and it was full of what looked like dry cubed pork chops. It tasted ok, but WTF? Call it a pork chop terrine if that's what it is.\\n\\n4. We ordered a bottle of Gamay and it came out room temperature. I'm guessing it was just in the back some where hanging out? The server casually informed us that she, \\"didn't sell much of this wine\\". The bottle retails for $15 and probably wholesales for around $10, we paid $43. A 4X markup is a lot for a place that doesn't know how to serve the wine. It's summer in Texas, Gamay is one of the few reds that are served semi chilled, figure it out. That wine should essentially be THE red wine they push given the season and their menu. Educate your staff, serve it properly! Also, teach your staff to refill a guest's glass if its low. It's awkward to pour sitting down and you sell more wine!\\n\\n5. Our chicken under a brick was a salty mess. The meat was over brined and the skin was nice and crispy but was itself covered in salt too. It was a decent size portion I guess. \\n\\n6. Our dessert was panna cotta. It was hands down the worst version I have ever had. Panna cotta is about texture and cream. Ours came with ice cream in the middle covered in all sorts of jams and pastes and nuts. The little globes of panna cotta were like rubber - someone got way too heavy handed with the gelatin. That dish needs to be rethought. It was an asian inspired ice cream sundae with milk jello. Back to the drawing board! \\n\\nI don't know what's going on at this place, it's just too expensive for what they are serving. I don't want to be mean but it's beyond me how this place stays in business. They appear to be successful which is great for them, I know it's a tough business.

I was hoping for a place to meet for business lunches, meet up after work for a happy hour, or have a nice dinner. The first time I went, I took my employees for a celebratory dinner. Food was great, service was great, even though they just opened, and I realize it takes restaurants awhile to find their groove sometimes. \\n\\nSecond time, met up for a happy hour on the rooftop deck. Apps and drinks were great. Service was a little slow up there, but it was a nice evening and no one minded. \\n\\nThird time, dinner on the roof. Drinks were good, not great, and about 50% of the food was decent. Other food was lukewarm and seemed old. Specifically the grilled cheeses with soups. \\n\\nFourth time, everything was bad. Poor service, warm beer, mixed drinks were pretty gross, and the all the food was tasteless. A few of us sent back our drinks, others just didn't finish. No one finished their food. Server didn't mention one thing about it. When we sent back the warm beer, she didn't even apologize. The server told us she was high. It's Boulder, I get it, but super unprofessional, and it was clearly affecting her ability to do her job. \\n\\nLast time, it was even worse than before. The vibe matched the food and drinks. \\n\\nEvery day, we get asked by visitors where they should eat lunch in the area. We used to send tons of people here, because initially it was good, and we really wanted to support a new business. After my experiences, as well as those of others I know, I don't feel comfortable recommending this restaurant to anyone. I think it can be good, it's just very dependent on who is working, both as servers and in the kitchen. \\n\\nThis place has such great potential, and my hopes were so high, but they have just continued to disappoint, which is sad.

With most restaurants, when I see a menu I have to go through a screening process where I locate the few options that I have available and then choose out of those. However, with an all-vegetarian menu, I just sat there looking at the menu  for ages, like I was dumbfounded or something. (The waitress became slightly annoyed perhaps since it took a good 5 minutes for me to decide)\\n\\nAnd decide I did: polenta fondutto with traditional Japanese green tea with toasted rice to drink, and a artichoke heart guacamole to start. My lady friend got Indian Korma with black rice and a glass of wine.\\n\\nNow, while the artichoke heart guacamole was so-so, everything else I must say was excellent. I've never tasted polenta this amazing. The wine was excellent, the tea was excellent, and they even have their own organic vodka. I can't rave enough about how good the food was. \\n\\nStill, why only 4 stars? Well, the portions are on the smaller side and the meal came to a whopping $60 for two people.

The oysters were quite good, but they were overpowered by the spiciness from the tasso, which tasted somewhat similar to chorizo to me. The grits were awesome. I loved the individual components but I'm not sure they came together as well as I'd like... they weren't particularly well-balanced.  \\n\\nFor my main course I got the surf and turf, which was a soft shell crab served with a small portion of filet. I ordered medium rare, and I got something more on the medium/medium well side of the spectrum. This seems to be a patter in Columbus. The steak was good, but not mindblowing. The softshell crab was smothered in a sauce that I didn't really care for, kind of sweet-mustard, not really a flavor I could define. It was okay at best. The crab was prepared really well and was obviously fresh. The sides were asparagus and mashed potatoes. The sauce from the beef went well with the potatoes. Overall, pretty good, but again, not mindblowing.\\n\\nI got a cocktail with vodka, rhubarb bitters, and soda, which was great. I also tried some of the wine that BBJ got and it was one of the best wines I've ever had. And their wine list is INSANE. I would definitely come back here to just order a couple of bottles of wine and hang out.\\n\\nWe all came here with my Fudha and they were really accommodating, even though we were in a group so it was a little weird with most of us having Fudhas. Bonus points to them for not being stodgy about that.

It's good food, but it's not $30+ entree good. Or at least the entrees I got. Not to say that I won't try it again, because I will.

Maybe.  I'm not sure what else on the brunch menu's main entrees truly captures my attention.   \\n\\nThat said, it's clear this kitchen can perform.

The potato latkes are also worth an order.  \\n\\nIn any event, Launderette fills the niche market of a casual restaurant with a strong kitchen pounding out American fare at reasonable prices.

Iced coffee and mimosas (mimosa: $7 each or a pricey $38 for a carafe) need to be served in a bigger glass/a bit more liquid per serving. My Benedict was tasty but looked lonely all by itself on my plate...a few potatoes or fruit or other small side would have been nice to see alongside the Benedict. The servings seem a bit stingy for the price, including my iced coffee. The Samoa GS cookies (2 cookies on a plate), brought to our table cold from the refrigerator (are they supposed to be chilly?), were just ok. There are plenty of good brunch reviews for this restaurant, but from our experience, I'm not sure why.

Once I had established this, I had a decent time there but can't say that it was anything great.\\n\\nFirst of all, I always have a difficult time deciding what to order in places that are pan-anything (the Cheesecake Factory would fall into this category as well).  It seems to me that when a restaurant tries to do everything, they end up with a lot of mediocrity.  \\n\\nWe had a large group, so we shared several orders of the calamari which was actually very good, as I always appreciate when places go light on the bread crumb batter in deep-fry situations.  I think I sampled a bit of someone else's seaweed salad, which was also tasty.  My sushi was just okay, and I was jealous that my food didn't come in the big slanted bowl referenced in other posts as my friends' dishes did.  \\n\\nOverall, Jae's is worth a visit, but don't save it for a special occasion.    Definitely skip it if you are indecisive in pan-Asian situations as I tend to be.

A truly crave-worthy veggie burger.  The patty is made in house with beets, black beans and carrots.

This mingles really well with some of the sweet flavours of the glaze, carrots and beets.  The patty is a touch on the mushier side, but overall a really great taste. The bun is nice and soft.  I added cheddar cheese, which was a good move if I do say so myself.   The burger comes with a choice of fries, yam fries or salad.  I added a side of veggie poutine for $3, which was good but maybe a bit too much gravy, which made the fries soggy.\\n\\nWe arrived at around 6pm on a Friday.

I've gone three times now, but three strikes and it is out.  This place really needs a serious change of management -- they make so many mistakes in orders and take forever.\\n\\nMy last visit I ordered two burgers, the Blue Devil and the Cali, for take out.  One I asked to be well done, but they didn't make a note of that anywhere.

I also overheard the chefs in the back tell the front desk that any new orders will now take 1 hour to make because they were so backed up. \\n\\nSo I ask what is going on - how much longer -- and hand her my receipt.  She said they were running really behind.  At that point, I notice that the receipt she handed me was someone else's receipt and Lauren told me they had lost my order in the system.  After wasting nearly an hour waiting, I would have to wait an entire additional hour because they screwed up my order in their system.  The place was utter chaos -- it seemed like a cook didn't show up.  Not only that, they did not warn anyone that they were backed up when initially taking take-out orders.  \\n\\nI simply don't understand how a take-out burger could take more than 15 minutes to make.  \\n\\nGiven the long and unpleasant wait, I asked to cancel my order -- I would have liked to have given them zero stars (if possible) but at least they did not charge my credit card, though I had expected them to.\\n\\nThis place needs a serious overhaul.

Also, there was a bit too much ricotta cheese which moistened a portion of the crust and made it a bit soggy.\\n\\nI do like the atmosphere although at lunch it can be difficult to carry on a conversation without shouting.

We really enjoyed the experience.  We were seated at the end of the long communal table and at first I thought it would feel too tight but it really was not.  Enjoyed visiting with the diners next to us.  Between us we sampled a variety of the dishes - except from the dessert section.  We all agreed they were interesting, quite tasty and all had something unique that we enjoyed.  Stand-outs were the charred tomato salad, the panna cotta, and the goat and potato terrain.  My only issue, and for us it is a big issue was that my son very clearly explained to our server that he is severely allergic to nuts and some seafood.  The server indicated that really nothing (until the dessert section) contained nuts and all ingredients are clearly noted on the menu.  My son then preceded to order the bread (which costs extra).  A different server brought the bread (very delicious - btw) and I noticed a small dish of something dark served with the bread.  I asked what it was and the server replied it was charred leek mole.  I then inquired if it contained nuts (as mole often does).  He looked at me oddly (condescendingly?) and said, no it is charred leeks.  I said ok - then no nuts?  He said, well it is mole.  So I said - nuts?  He finally, hesitantly said well yes there are nuts, it's mole.  It was like a who's on first conversation.  I just felt, in a small, intimate restaurant such as this, if we clearly explained our situation and asked our server what contained nuts - he should have been familiar with the menu and let us know about the bread  and also the other servers should be trained to know what contains nuts!!  We acknowledge that the risk is on us if we choose to eat somewhere with our son and we never ask for any dishes to be changed, we only want to be informed as to what contains nuts.  So for us that was the only misstep (a fairly big one) in an otherwise very enjoyable and unique dining experience out.\\n\\nn.b. - for those that are large eaters - My son, after cleaning all 3 or his plates at Lenoir and eating some of mine did skip across the street to La Mexicana where he enjoyed 4 barbacoa tacos (all for under $5$ :)"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is amazing!!!!!

The idea came from 3 good friends, husband and wife team Jen and Joe Strickland and Terri Hannifan in November of 2005.  They had been working on the idea for almost 5 years before they finally were able to launch one of Austin's better pizza places. Since 2005 they have been helping keep South Congress one of the hippest places to hang out as well.\\n\\nFrom the moment you walk in you feel like they just \\"Get it\\". The staff always appears extremely happy (you mean they actually enjoy coming to work?) and the food is consistently good.

We've already have eaten at Home Slice a bunch of times, so we were excited to finally write a review for them (not that they are hurting for press or anything). The waiter, like always, was hanging like it was a house party at a friend's place.  The laid back atmosphere and great mix of people make Home Slice very comfortable and inviting.\\n\\nThe pizza arrives and it's like you're sitting on the mean streets of New York. This is the closest interpretation of what true east coast pizza is all about that we have in Austin.  The pie is a perfect blend of flavors, clean sauce with a light dusting of oregano and parmesan cheese, topped with a terrific mozzarella and provolone blend. The pepperonis are fantastic because they give you just the right amount of flavor without taking away from the cleanness of the rest of the pie. The crust is thin (but I've seen the thickness vary lately) but has nice stability to fold and do it the right way, thanks to the gas deck oven cooking at a pretty high temperature.\\n\\nI don't know what it is but it just seems like the pizza flavor really flows, Home Slice has tremendous flavor balance from start to finish.   I found myself full not really wanting more but yet still eating more because it was that good.   Home Slice is one of the only full service pizza places in town with a simple but effective beer and wine selection.

The fruit loop donut was very sweet, but if you like fruit loops, it was awesome.  The Old Dirty Bastard is chocolate, crushed Oreos, and drizzled peanut butter, it was amazing.  The Maple Bacon donut... you may have seen this at other places, but they don't cheap out here and they make it right.  Anthony Bourdain showed it best.

Most of the vegetarian options were just modified menu items which would have originally come with meat. We were overall happy with the food; they have excellent presentation and the creativity level is brilliant.\\nDue to the noise level, we did have a miscommunication with the host staff, which caused us to be seated 45 minutes after our reservation.

It was a very large potion ...enough for 2-3 meals but I just couldn't do it so after meal one it went into the trash. There is 30 bucks down the drain. Previously I have the spring rolls, lobster fried rice, coconut shrimp and calamari. Can you say oil, oil, oil. It was very oily and left a bad taste in my mouth. Lastly I had the Suspension cake.

We ordered a variety of small plates which were all excellent!

He explained the ordering process to us and answered all our questions about the crust (which is made with healthy whole wheat flour and a bunch of other stuff I don't remember). What impressed me most was the way he interacted with the staff.  They were having fun, but he challenged them with making our pie in under six minutes and you should have seen them jump!  The pie was awesome!  We had the Sonoran.  I loved the texture too.  It was a great flavor combination and crisp on the outside, but still palatable, not like the cracker they serve at Upper Crust where we usually go.

I ordered the Oven Cake Breakfast, partly of the hype and partly cause it just sounds too good to pass up.  The quantity is good and instead of the eggs, I gave their tofu scramble a try.  I have no idea how their tofu scramble is made, but the outer coating of powder made every bite a struggle.  The texture was what I expected, which was no problem.  But the taste of the powder wasn't acceptable for my tongue at all.  Apologies that I can't describe the flavor, but after only a few bites, I threw in the white flag.  The body of the cornbread was good and combined well with the blueberry.  However the top and bottom were burned which made it a struggle to bite through.

But you probably shouldn't go to a place that has 'wing' in the title if you're vegetarian. \\nWhere this place stands out is probably the fact that they have a drive-through available. There aren't many places where you can find traditional bone-in wings at a drive-through restaurant. However, I have not ordered from there and some of the reviews that I've read on yelp state that it is not as convenient of a process as you might like. But, maybe that's why you never really find traditional wings at a drive-through. \\nOverall it's a good stop for lunch.  I do wish they would expand some of their lunch specials to make it worthwhile and it would probably increase the traffic in the restaurant during lunch times."},{"name":"Townsman","address":"120 Kingston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Saddle up to the bar, where you can watch some food being prepared while you wait for your order to arrive.

Perhaps it's because I don't buy into the bacon trend that has swept the Sates or that I'm less inclined toward a sweet-savory combo, but IF I WERE - I'd say this was a great donut.

Cutting into my Voodoo Doll, I was quite pleased to see it oozing out raspberry jelly from it's abdomen. Clever, really. Otherwise, I was a bit unimpressed because it was just too sweet.

If you're offered an off-the-menu dish, especially one with a green mango sauce or relish, jump on it.  It will be the pride of the kitchen and delicious.

Garlic naan and onion naan, which includes cilantro, are two of my favorites.

I asked to speak to a manager, I inform her of the challenge, and she walks me back to the table. To be fair, she DID comp our entire meal and my food soon came out BUT she made an unnecessary comment about how she \\"can't turn back time\\" since we hadn't had food in 2hrs. So ....the upside was the fish & grits were DELICIOUS ....just like the salmon chips. I chaulked it up to a miscommunication and concentrated on the great food.\\n\\n Fast forward a day, I bring my husband back because he wanted to see what all the fuss was about. We were seated quickly but they walked through a lot of empty seats and placed us right by the back door. This is usually not a problem but it was between 20-30 degrees and you were blasted w. cold air every time the door opened. We dined in our coats. The waitress was prompt and friendly ...we ordered the salmon chips (again, delicious) and both of us had the crawfish benedict. This is pretty much where things go south. She had asked if we were okay with soft poached eggs...we were. When the meal arrived (which was SUPER quick) ...it was lukewarm and the eggs weren't soft-poached, they were under done. The whites were not cooked and there is nothing quite as unappetizing as a gooey under done white. Along with that, the dish needed salt (which isn't on the table). The crawfish lacked any seasoning whatsoever .... the hollandaise was probably good but it was cold & lacked any depth. Even the side of gouda grits I had ordered the day before were bland and cold. I'm sure it was a mix of prepping and the repeated blast of cold air from the outside. We managed to struggle through the benedict and we figured we'd sweeten the meal w. the bragged about donut that they offered. The donut arrived ice cold and while it tasted okay, it was nothing to write home about. Even the cocktails were unbalanced and unappealing. Nothing short of the $11-14 price tag convinced us to finish our drinks ....\\n\\nAll in all ... the only thing worth mentioning were the fish & grits and the salmon chips (Seriously, YUM) ... but neither makes it worth the drive or the expense. My first meal was comped but my 2nd trip ran me every bit of $105 and I've never had a more not-worth it meal. This may be a hotspot but I'm not impressed and I won't be back.

Last nite after missing a few turns and streets, I couldn't get here and ended up at the Aria.  Found it tonite and coming out of Aria expectation/standard, it might be a tall order to stand up to.  The place looks interesting, huge patio fill with lots of people.  The entrance has a beat up mini car with lots of plantation around making it looks very French.  Also lots of import luxury vehical.  The passage into the dinning room was designed to be casual and bistrol style than the more formal Aria.  Servers were not in uniform and casual made it a bit dinner friendly ?  I don't know.  Menu was exactly what they advertised on all those visitor magazines.  I ordered the escargot which was fantastic, not the usual on the shell or bake in pastry, it's sautee in heavy cream with tomato and a polenta in the middle.  Probably froezn or from can but whatever, it was nicely done and tasty.  The duck confit also came out very French with kidney beans.  Unfortunately, it was just a tad salty but the bean was flat, so it balance out if you eat everything a mouthful together.  At the end I got some free ice-cream too.   My bill was about 30% less than Aria somehow with the exact number of drinks and appertizer + Entree, the duck confit cost more than the pork shoulder from Aria but I guess the wine was less..

To honour them, we went on our own and did a taste test. The full review is in the macaron blog ...here is a section from it. \\n\\nWe also ordered 3 sandwiches...\\nThe chicken salad (which comes on a croissant), the turkey and brie w/berry compote (on a baguette) and turkey, bacon cheddar w/o the bacon because I try to keep Kosher.\\n\\nThe Savouries\\nMost places in Atlanta that are specialty sandwich shoppes or anything other than a large chain charge about $3.50 - $8.50 for a good sandwich. I define a good sandwich as something on bread that has been baked that same day, has an incredible homemade sauce/aioli/mayo plus another mustard or tart like spread on the opposite slice of bread, the perfect set of greens to compliment the other veggies and proteins and is at least 3-4 inches tall in size (and that's just the filling). Those types of sandwiches are servd in parchment paper, wrapped in brown butcher paper and placed in a paper bag made of recycled materials. Every now and again, a sandwich like that costs upwards of $11 but with the rise of custom burgers in every part of the city you can find them at $5 or $8. Amelie's sandwiches are available a la carte or with a side and a drink. A la care is about $6.00 with tax. The bread is very light, there is hardly any weight to the sandwich and it fits in a standard plastic to-go container if you wish to take it with you. It looks small compared to Alon's or some of the other French bistros in town. I'm used to being weighted down by sandwiches. However, don't let the lower height fool you, the flavour in these is big enough to satisfy the soul. I think had I bought soup, a drink and a side to go with it, making it a little more than $11 with tip I would be completely satisfied. My friend did just that and she was good to go for the rest of the night.\\n\\nSweet Starlettes\\nThe desserts are the highlight. After passing through the seating area you are face to face with an entire counter that stretches far and wide full of pastries. I may be exaggerating but there were so many things from which to choose. Twice baked croissants filled with cream cheese, nice sized muffins with amazing toppings that were not only visible on top but throughout  the muffin. There are the deep cut standards of French fare, meaning it's more than a bunch of stereotypical eclaires, it's so much more than that.\\n\\nLes Macarons Francaises\\nMy initial reason for going was just to go to have some Macarons. I was going to do a clean out...you know, \\"I need all of your macarons...all of them. Now! Merci :)\\" I instead only cleaned out their stash of lemon, vanilla bean and took just 2 of the raspberry. These are like the ones they have at Henri's bakery but MUCH larger and not as sweet. The macarons at Alon's and Doucer de France have a lingering taste, you can enjoy them long after they are over and it's a real taste explosion...a party even in your mouth. Amelie's Atlanta seem to \\"just visit.\\" The ones at the Charlotte location lingered...I had an orange cream and a vanilla if I remember correctly and I could taste those macarons until my next meal. They were really flavour keepsakes. The Atlanta one's seem to hit you where you want it and then they are gone...and I'm okay with that. I will go back for more. \\n\\nAtmosphere\\nIt's quaint and cozy. There are a variety of seating options from cafe tables to what look to be plush chairs and bold decor.

Even though it was pretty packed, they seem to do a good job turning over tables, but it left us feeling rushed our entire meal. I think we were in there a total of half an hour. We had a huge lunch so were only looking for some small plates. The pisco sour was decent but a bit acidic. For being Peruvian, there was not a whole lot of authentic dishes on the menu. I know alpaca and guinea pig might be hard to get in the US but that is what you often see on menus in Peru. The regular ceviche, which came recommended, was my least favorite dish. While I liked their serving vessel being a wide bowl as I always had in Peru (as opposed to martini glasses in the States), it was missing a fresh fruit component. I like my ceviche with spice but I think that is more a US thing and in Peru there was always some awesome fresh fruit that was impressive. This was just whitefish, onions and acid. Corn and sweet potatoes just felt out of place for me although I liked the onion ratio. Overall, it was far too acidic for the whitefish to shine. The octopus was very tender but it really needed some char. The chimi that came with it was on point though. We both agreed the shrimp best dish. It had a nice crust on the outside and moist and sweet on the inside.

You would think with all the people in the place the pizza would be heavenly. Its Pizza for god sakes. Nope. The crust was limp, not fully cooked, I love New york pizza, but part of it being ny style pizza is you have to be able to fold it without the cheese sauce toppings falling off this was not possible with ours, fork and knife required. The crust/dough had no taste. There was hardly any sauce on the thing and the spinach was not wrung out properly, spinach water in every sad bite.  Top that off to the fact we split the damn thing and I still paid 21 bucks including tip, for HALF A PIZZA! This did not include my drink tab. Also, it was a very dark place. I undestand that you are on soco, and that dark is hip, but come on, i wanna be able to see what I'm eating. Is THAT how you dupe your customers into giving you high ratings?!?!

We sat outside and the ambiance was perfect.. trendy but romantic. Music playlist was on point-- indie, upbeat, hip. Loved it all. Parking lot is small but there is street parking all over. No issues there. Some people were dressed up and some people strolled in wearing gym clothes. More upscale than not.. but it seemed like a \\"come as you are\\" sorta place.\\n\\nWe started with the brussels sprouts and crab toast. I'm from Maryland, so I know my way around a crab dish and this was fantastic. Came with two slices so it was perfect for 2 but could easily be cut again for a party of 4. Brussels were savory, sweet, sticky... barely short of perfection. Why does Austin have so many restaurants with GREAT brussels? I would get both of these again.\\n\\nThen we went main course.. got the chicken thigh as per yelp suggestion (Do not overlook the chicken dish here.. moist, crispy skin, delightful sauce on the side), pickled green tomatoes with fried jalapenos (a play on fried green tomatoes? I liked it just fine, but not my favorite pick. I wish we had tried the cauliflower instead), and the plancha burger. Wow that burger. Bacon in the patty, perfect bun, special sauce, and perfectly pickled.. well, pickles. Not a GIANT steakhouse size burger, which I preferred.

One of the great things about Mary Mac's is the number of choices. Usually, you might go into a restaurant, see a large menu, and know that the kitchen can't possibly cook all that stuff very well.

The whole nine yards. I research this sort of junk, and I do feel like I know a little too much. As Yelp works on a 5 star scale, is it heresy to review anything but Franklin's as a 5? I guess... maybe I am on thin ice here. But I did think the stuff is here. Maybe they should have an F rating... just for Franklin. Franklin still has my heart, as it literally threw my brisket spectrum off of the scale.\\n\\nIn effect, I knew I had to get to JMueller before the plots thickened within the Austin smoked-meat realm. We went on the coldest day of the year. As we pulled up around 10:30AM, we knew we had to plot a plan of eating attack. Get our meat, scarf it down, and leave before the cold even had a chance to attack. It didn't work.\\n\\nLet us lay out the scene: 4 hungry gentlemen. 40 degree weather with a 35 degree windchill. 1.5 lb. brisket, .5 lb. pork shoulder, 3 ribs, 1 beef short rib, .25 lb. turkey (was not for me... I promise... I have not eaten turkey at a BBQ establishment for quite some time), 2 beef sausages. A touch cheaper than Franklin: ~$50 for all of us.\\n\\nAs I stated before, we got beat by the (opposite of) heat. The meat got cold within about 5 minutes. Good thing we only had a few pieces remaining.\\n\\nThe overriding theme here: the bark. It was crusty, smoky, rich, meaty, and flavorful.... everything you desire out of what I like to call \\"meat chocolate.\\" The brisket was fatty, tender, dang near perfect. The ribs were meatier, but, in effect, did not yield a good amount tenderness. Again, the crust was good. The pork shoulder was texturally akin to the ribs. The sausage was top o' the line: it possessed a good \\"snap\\", and the bold flavor was fantastic. Turkey? Didn't try it, rightfully so.\\n\\nOK, to the winner: the beef short rib. Normally beef ribs do well in braising. But... here with dry heat provided by smoke, the cattle bone just melted. Absolutely melted. Quite phenomenal. Usually a beef rib, regardless of how delicious it is, cannot be pulled apart by human hands alone.\\n\\nJMueller's is one of the new kids on the block (SoFi has some AWESOME new eateries), which is sort of weird... because he was actually one of the original protein-based meal pioneers.

The wait staff are great (one even offered me some free broth when I was sick to help me feel better), and the food is great if you're a southerner. But that's just it: many Atlantans are immigrants from other states or other countries, and even the younger generation of southerners has lost touch with its culinary roots (I can attest to that as a young southerner). While I personally love the sweet tea, the fried green tomatoes, the black eyed peas, and all the things that make southern food great, I think that many in Atlanta are no longer aware (or were never aware) of that tradition. \\nThat's all plainly apparent when you walk into Mary Mac's and see the age group they cater to mostly. The people who appreciate good southern food, and can cook it, are ageing. Atlanta is modernizing and Mary Mac's needs to catch the rest of the pack or they risk getting left behind. Maybe some advertisements aimed at a different crowd? Or food designed to slowly ease a non-southerner into southern cuisine? All I know is that this place, while great, is a dying institution.

It took quite a while to get a window seat at that time (~15+ minutes) but once we got seated the ambiance and the view made everything a-okay. It does seem like Top of the Hub realizes that they have a great viewing spot of Boston and as a result do not feel that they need to bring the best service.

The quality of ingredients great.  There's a lot to love about Pescatore.\\n\\nBut their service is just so completely horrible, it makes it really unappealing to eat here.  They have a serious, SERIOUS, problem with service.  Last time we were here, dinner lasted THREE HOURS.  Yes.  2.5 hours for our meal to come out.  It was delicious, and they were annoyingly apologetic, almost in a confrontational way.  Normally, I'd appreciate apologies but what happened here was so OBTRUSIVE it almost made me furious.  After an hour, the waitress returned to the table at minimum, once every five minutes to commiserate, and apologize, and tell us all about her personal life, and chastise us for ordering something difficult to cook, and, and, and.... I mean, REALLY.  I don't know why she didn't just pull up a chair, since there was no way for any of us to conduct conversations without her butting in.\\n\\nWhen we were finally exhausted and ready to leave after our 3 hour meal, she insisted we have dessert on the house (it will only take a half hour to prepare!)  We of course said no, but thanks for the offer.  (She should have just taken something off the bill instead, but that's neither here nor there.)  But she refused to take no for an answer until someone in our party had to raise their voice to get her to shut up.  Basically, it was just her trying to make sure she got a good tip, because it wasn't her fault, as she kept telling us, over and over and over.\\n\\nSo, I don't know why I went back.  I guess because I love the food.  I do.  This is one of my 'go to' restaurants in the area.  We made sure to go on a dead night.  Restaurant more than half empty.  Dinner started off badly when on the way to sit down at the table, my companion said to me 'brr... it's cold out there tonight'.  To which she went off on how he wasn't properly dressed for the cold and it wasn't the restaurant's fault because they had the heat on, and our table was far enough from the door not to be drafty.   No one had even complained, and no one had said it to her.  And essentially this went on throughout the meal.  We order a salad to share.  I put some on my plate and start to eat.  She runs over and says 'oh your plate is too big, let me get you a smaller plate so the table isn't so crowded', so she takes my food away while I am literally eating and have salad on my fork.  Then once she replaces it, she says 'the salad bowl is too big' and took the large salad away and came back with it on a tiny plate.  Then as I try to eat, she starts moving glasses, and water, and salt and pepper shakers and, and,  LEAVE ME THE F&@&@&K ALONE!  No one had asked her for any of this meddling.  \\n\\nSo then she just keeps coming back every few minutes to tell us all about her personal life, and to continue to chastise my companion for his poor choice of winter jackets, etc.  Well, 90 minutes after ordering, our entrees finally arrive, and wouldnt you know it?  She got BOTH of the orders wrong.  Not one.  But BOTH. I don't eat mussels, so a big plate of mussels was not an acceptable substitution.  She then chastised both of us and said it was our faults she got the orders wrong because we weren't clear enough when we ordered.  She said there were a few things on the menu with very similar names.  Well, then she should know to clarify that.  So my companion finally loses it and says 'Is there some reason you feel the need to make me the villain here? Our order was wrong. It doesn't matter whose fault it is. All that matters is I am not getting my dinner tonight, and you're here arguing over whose fault it is.  I don't CARE WHOSE FAULT IT IS'\\n\\nWell, she runs off and puts in the order for our actual dinners, and tells us it should only take an hour to which point we say 'forget it. we're tired.  Just bring us the check'.  So furious, probably because it means she'll get a smaller tip, she shouts across the restaurant, full voice, snidely, 'FORGET THEIR DINNERS! THEY'RE JUST GOING TO LEAVE!'  She drops off the check and runs off.  \\n\\nI've eaten there at least 20 times.  And this is the third time I've had this waitress, and she just keeps getting battier and battier.  If they treat the 'regulars' this way, imagine how they treat everyone else.\\n\\nSo, ultimately, it means I will no longer eat at a restaurant with food I really like because it just isn't worth the hassle.  Nothing is worth this kind of hassle."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very cool and unique place. Awesome food.

Their menu only consisted of 3 different types of ramen (they offer a spicy option for the miso ramen but not sure for the others). They make you place your order with the host so that way it reduces any wait time which I think is very smart! I went with the shoyu ramen $11- The broth is on the creamy side but nonetheless still flavorful but also a little salty. There was minced pork, half an egg, bamboo, some corn and wakame in the ramen but if you'd like to add anything additional, it'll be $1/item.

I usually drink most of my broth but strangely I stopped about a quarter of the way.  The noodle consistency reminds me of a al dente pasta.  It tasted as it was a packaged ramen that was instantly heated up.  This was the major disappointment to me.  The pork meat was delicious and fatty.  Try the extra pork toppings if you are especially hungry.  The pork cheek is delicious and tender.  The marinated egg is also good too.  \\n\\nOverall, Santouka is a decent ramen shop.

The filets were extremely salty & we considered returning them but did not want to ruin our family Christmas dinner by waiting for replacements. The short rib was very basic/nonremarkable. The chocolate cake dessert tasted as if it had come frozen from the grocery store. The pistachio desserts were bland. We had looked forward to our dining experience @ Hamilton's Kitchen, but with so much wrong, it was difficult to consider this a positive memorable experience. It is also apparent that this restaurant does not follow its dress code suggestions as there were diners dressed in shorts, flip flops, & t-shirts for Christmas dinner."},{"name":"China Dragon","address":"798 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I love Chinese - at fast food take out stands in the mall, at high end restaurants.  You name it.  But seriously, this is the most disgusting chinese food I have ever ordered, eaten, or seen - ever.  Stay away.  Far away.  Everything, and I do mean everything is fried.  I like fried food - but this food is fried not in a good way.  You order sweet and sour chicken and get some strange box of extreme-breaded chicken nuggets with a side of pre-fab sweet and sour sauce.  The shrimp in every dish, whether specified or not, is fried.

It is great to be able to try so many different  dishes on the menu.  Between the four of us we ordered ceviche, avocados stuffed with crab, quinoa salad, and the octopus.  By far my favorite dish was the octopus.  I have never had octopus that was cooked so perfectly.  It was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Everything we ordered was great but if you like octopus you need to try it here.\\n\\nWe had reservations, i recommend that, and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.

When my girlfriend returned she said the stall was so small, she had to step out of it to close her pants. I explained I hadn't ordered yet, still no menus. My gut said it was time to leave, but lets give this a chance, it has to get better. Five minutes later we ask a random staff member for menus. Five minutes later a waitress appears, apologized for the wait, she wasn't informed she had a table. We ordered appetizers and a refill of beer.  She never heard of the Harpoon dark that I ordered from the down stairs bar earlier, asking me to pick something else from the drink menu.

I got the Herbivore with added Arugula and it was delicious.\\n\\nIt is not a pizza by the slice so expect to wait for your pizza, but even then they were really quick. The crust was the perfect balance of crunchy and soft and the cheese had great pull meaning it was good quality and baked for the proper amount of time. Everyone at my table loved the pizza. \\n\\nMy only complaint is the pricing. The pricing matching full size pizzas at many pizza places of the same caliber but for a pizza that only serves 2 or 4 if everyone is okay with one slice. \\n\\nOverall though I highly recommend this place. It goes right up there with Homeslice as the best pizza joints in all of Austin."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We went strictly for the warm GF chocolate chip cookie with coconut milk ice cream.

Reservations are welcome, and on the evening we went, nearly each table was occupied.\\n\\nThey've scattered fewer than ten tables about the edge of their dining room so that their customers did not sit one on top of another.  The furniture is a bit eclectic yet cushy.\\n\\nAs a bakery by day, and a restaurant at night, they have a rather short but simple menu for their evening guests with 3 starter options, 2 entrees, and 3-4 dessert selections (that's if you count the cheese selections among them).\\n\\nBread offerings were two, and came served with a little bowl full of roasted garlic cloves that reminded me pleasantly of Vinny Testa's, minus the bulb.  The slices worked better with the garlic, but that didn't stop me from trying to spread them on the roll as well.\\n\\nThe soup of the day was butternut squash $10, so we opted for that as well as an order of the Country Pate, cornichons & dijon $12.  The soup was of the savory sort, but being quite rich and smooth and in contrast with the sweet crisp diced apple garnish, it was rather luxurious.  The pate was a mix of savory and sweet, crispy and smooth.  Their appetizers turned out to be my favorite of our three courses.\\n\\nThe entrees options were but two: Beef Bourguignon $26 or Chicken with Citrus and Thyme $24.  Normally, my DC and I would get one of each so we could try both.  But my DC tends to avoid chicken when eating out, and didn't like either of the vegetables that came with the fowl - turnips and brussel sprouts.  I considered getting the chicken anyways since I preferred those vegetables over the carrots and mushrooms which were in the beef stew, till our server told me that it was a single chicken breast.  I prefer dark meat.  So two Beef Bourguignons it was!\\n\\nMy first bite of beef was a bad first impression as I found it dry and tough.  I dug around however and found some softer bits on my plate.  So when our server asked how things were, I told her about my run-in with the tough beef.  Shortly after, the elderly gentleman asked us the same, and I told him the same.  He voiced that I may have received one of the tougher bottom bits.  Near the end of our meal, our server came by and asked us (again!) how we liked our meal.  I kept mum this time to be polite as two pieces of beef now remained sadly pushed aside on my otherwise empty plate, while my friend responded a route \\"Fine.\\"  But instead of leaving us, she repeated her question again to me.  So I spoke up with an \\"eh\\" and a gesture to the offending chunks as in addition to finding some of the beef unappetizingly tough, the dish was a bit bland.\\n\\nAfterwards I consulted with my DC, and he agreed that the beef was rather tough, but he tends to just say everything is fine unless he finds that the food warrants being sent back.  When he was done with his entree, half still remained on the plate, inclusive of several chunks of beef, all of which he declined to take home in a doggie bag.\\n\\nThe cake of the day was lemon $10, so of course we had to get that.  The other pick was the galette $11, as my DC claims - cookies aren't dessert.  The galette was apple and individually sized.  It came at room temperature which was a bit odd since the elderly gentleman had pronounced to us that they had just come out of the oven as we were mulling over the dessert options.  The cake was a rectangular slice with lemon curd tucked between the cake layers and garnishing the plate, and a dusting of coconut shreds covering the coating of frosting.  It was tender and soft and just sweet enough.\\n\\nThe desserts were tasty, but their simplicity of presentation and light portion sizes did not earn the two digit price tag, particularly when compared to similarly priced treats at establishments I have visited this year such as Bergamot and The Capital Grille.\\n\\nWhile the service here was pleasant, it was a bit slow at times, such that I would suggest this to be a place to visit when one is feeling more leisurely.  And I found it odd that they would ask how things were - so often! - if they weren't going to care about what I had to say.\\n\\nTheir online menu has since been updated to reflect the one we were presented with on the evening of our visit."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic view of the City.

It was my first time having duck meat but it was very yummy and they drizzle several sauces on the plate that compliment them well. For the main course I went with Pineapple Fried Rice and added the jumbo tiger shrimp. It's actually served out of a pineapple that has been cut in half and hollowed out.

Usually, there is way too much rice. The ramen (choose your flavor - I got shoyu) was amazing. It wasn't overwhelmingly flavorful with pork. Mine also had crunchy bamboo shoots ^_^\\n* Chashu pork + ramen combo ($15 f or small, ^ add ons same pricing as above): The chashu was really tender!

It is located just south of 6th street, right behind Parkside, which makes sense after learning that they are one in the same, and also explains for the lack of decor and personality at The Backspace. I appreciate minimalism in restaurant decor, but the inside was just rather gross looking. For example, the walls looked unfinished, candle wax was dripping all over them. In addition, the place was swarming with flies. We had four flies hovering just around our table throughout the entire meal. And these weren't your traditional outdoor flies either - these looked like fat fruit flies. Yuck. Alas, we were still looking forward to our meal.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 types of antipasti - the baked ricotta and the artichokes. The baked ricotta was delicious.

The first few bites of Yume Wo Katare is absolutely delicious.  Santouka was good but does not blow you away.\\n\\nThe size: Santouka wins.  Santouka ramen comes in a much more reasonable sized bowls.  You can pay $1 more for a larger bowl or $1 less for a smaller bowl.  I was able to eat the large bowl without any issues.  At YWK, I always have to ask for less noodles, and even then, I have trouble finishing.\\n\\nFattiness: Santouka wins.  I would recommend Santouka's shio broth over the shoyu broth.  The shio broth gives you more of the flavor of the pork whereas shoyu's soy sauce flavor masks it a little.  YWK's broth is porky and similar to the shio broth.  The issue that I have is the extra pork fat that they like to ladle on top of your ramen.  So I always have to ask them for no extra pork fat.\\n\\nNoodles: YWK wins hands down by a mile.  Santouka uses thin noodles that is pre-purchased whereas YWK's noodles are much thicker, chewer and house-made.  \\n\\nLast few bites: Santouka wins. Santouka is very consistent--each bite tastes like the last.  When I first eat YWK, I definitely enjoy it way more.  However, there is a point where the experience becomes less enjoyable, and by the end, I usually feel kind of disgusting after ingesting so much pork fat and salt.\\n\\nExtra Sides: Santouka wins.  Santouka offers extra pieces of chashu, bamboo, egg etc.  YWK has an option of 2 vs 5 pieces of chashu only but also more of bean sprouts/cabbage. \\n\\nDining Experience: Santouka wins.  I feel slightly more leisurely dining at Santouka.  There is no need to feel the need to finish the entire bowl (at YWK, they publicly shout out \\"Next Time\\" when you don't finish so some may feel more pressure to eat more than they want).

Friends of ours went during a more normal busy time of around 5pm and were presented with a one hour wait!  I don't know if one hour is worth it for these novelty donuts but it's something that you can't miss when you come into Portland. \\n\\nI tried five types of donuts: Memphis Mafia, bacon maple, voodoo doll, old dirty bastard, and the Portland cream.  I would get everything again if I came back EXCEPT the Portland cream and the voodoo doll.  While the voodoo doll maybe is the most fun looking donut, the raspberry jelly was underwhelming and like the same jelly you get out of donuts from Safeway.  Same goes for the bavarian cream in the Portland cream.  The bacon maple is a simple donut but nice combination of actual bacon and maple frosting.  The Memphis mafia will run you the cost of a Starbucks grande mocha latte but it will feed you til the next morning unless you want to take in mounds of calories in one sitting.   Everything from the fried dough and banana filling to the chocolate chips and peanut butter on top made it such a rich creation.  And my ultimate favorite was the old dirty bastard.

But here, for the ambiance and prices, it should have been taken care of. \\nAlso, it appears that they cut back on the quality of their ingredients. The famous mac and cheese came out burned on top, plus it was not as creamy as I remember it being. My cousins steak was almost completely rare when he asked for well done. Plus my house salad was just  plate of lettuce. No carrots, no tomatoes, no nuts, nothing but lettuce. I think the prices are high for what you get. Eight dollars for lettuce is really uncalled for!

They had filled one chafing dish with mala string beans i put some on my plate and as i was telling my mother in law to get some i hear them say this is the last tray take them out so we can take down stairs as there are more people down there... Really does it not matter for the diners upstairs? Several items that were listed on your website for the mothers day brunch were not even on your buffet or maybe they didnt make it out before we left at 4:30 .. such as green bean almondine and chicken bruchetta.

Good thing we stopped by as with most Bourdain promoted establishments. I don't even like sweets but this place was CRACK. The colors on the doughnuts are as psychedelic as you can get and the flavors are just as intense. The bacon doughnut (thought to myself WTF???) tastes amazing! It was like you wrapped your pancake and bacon from breakfast, covered in maple syrup and injected it into a crepe which was then deep fried. Sounds unhealthy? Probably is... but we enjoyed every single bite.

We didn't know what to expect so we had to try it out ourselves.  The service was fast and friendly.  We got chips and salsa as soon as we got there, along with our drinks.  Salsa was too spicy for the kid but he'll learn.  We ordered (a little pricey) and didn't have to wait too long for our food.

They were like bloated flautas, open at both ends.  Weird, but good.  I got the Supreme Nachos.  I felt like splurging, I had only snacked on veggies all day.  The nachos were huge!  My kid ate some of the shrimp, my boyfriend nibbled on a nacho or two and I still had a half of plate to take home for leftovers (still good the next day!).  The kid got chicken nuggets, basically the cheapo small Micky D's style nugget with generic french fries.  All in all, it did taste like AZ mexican food (Phoenicians, you know what I'm talkin' about).  It's no Aranda's (more Americanized, if you will) and the beans are NOT porky tasting, thank god!\\n\\nThe bill was lower than expected.  Apparently the nachos are cheaper during happy hour.  The football game was loud enough for the kitchen staff to hear, but then again, you Texans ARE obsessed with football.  So I guess that's to be expected.

I would say you need to find the right menu item and stick with it, as some things can be hit or miss. The salmon chips appetizer is unique and absolutely delicious. I love the brisket, as it is perfectly cooked, tender, and tasty. On the other hand, some dishes- Mahi Mahi comes to mind- aren't very good at all, and I have no idea why they serve it.

Some places use a heavy hand with mayo, but I didn't think it was the case here.  I really enjoyed this roll, but I wish they would have been more generous with the lobster filling considering the hefty price tag they charge per sandwich.   \\n\\nBeing in Boston, I knew I had to get my Oyster fix, so I also ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell ($14.28) - They shucked the oysters in front of me, and these suckers were huge!  I usually prefer smaller oysters because the big ones always tend to be too salty with a more intense seafood flavor.  Not these oysters.  These suckers were the smoothest \\"large\\" oysters I've ever tasted.  I squeezed lemon juice on them, topped them with a bit of horseradish and cocktail sauce, and it was perfection.  I'm still dreaming about them...\\n\\nOh by the way, they accept credit card now!"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Came to Portland for the weekend and made a reservation here because it was the \\"buzz-worthy\\" place.

Then we were greeted by a nice gentleman that ran through the specials.  Time to think ready to order but then another guy came to take the order.  He wasn't able to make any recommendations to us because he barely spoke English, although after us communicated back to him in Spanish it still seemed that he didn't know the menu.  We started with ceviche which were small portions and nothing out of this world, I almost asked for extra lime to add more acidic flavor.   I got the special of the Tuna. It came out with an Asian influence!  Sitting in broth with bok choy and shiitake mushrooms.

Another group who was waiting before us was not so lucky because not everyone in their party had arrived, so we got seated before them.  Our wait turned out to be at most 30 minutes.  I think considering how busy the restaurant is and that there's at best about 34 seats (and obviously because we benefited from this), the policy is fair.  Most people also respect the fact that there are plenty of people waiting, and tend not to linger after their meals.  Still, when we were leaving just before 2pm, there was STILL a wait to be seated!\\n\\nWith all the reviews here about the food already, I'm not going to belabour the point.

Everett was the first location developed by the founder \\"Bo\\" and it shows. The same gentlemen who opened the doors still works there and even if I don't go in for a year, he says hello to me by name. \\n\\nBeyond that, the food is stellar, and you can get a good value if you know what to order. The clam chowder is amazing, while not distinctly Thai it's one of my favorite soups in PDX. Pineapple curry will melt your cloudy day any time of the year. The Pad Thai (because everyone will order it) is better than the streets of Bangkok has to offer. I'm rarely vegetarian, but their tofu is out of this world. The fisherman's rice is $15 bucks, but that along with the Crab Pad Thai is something I consistently order. The former is a pile of fried rice with bacon, two types of tasty fish, and crispy green leaves that encourage you to share the meal only with yourself. You might regret that you said \\"family\\" style after the tender chunks of halibut and salmon hit your plate. \\n\\nIs it more than other Thai food, yep. Is it worth it, yep. My Yelp brothers and sisters will not be disappointed if you're prepared to go upscale Thai and do it at the right venue. Do I love Baan Thai near the PSU park blocks, absolutely.

The thing I miss most about Houston is James Coney Island. (Okay, just kidding, I really miss the museums and the zoo the most, but James Coney Island is third on the list of things I miss the most.) I especially love when I can get a hot dog composed of actual meat - then I can pretend I'm eating something slightly healthier as compared to the other options. Given how much I love hot dogs, I have no idea why it took me so long to try this place. No, actually, I do know - it's downtown and I never eat downtown. Mystery solved. \\n\\nBefore I even talk about the food, I need to tell you about the most important discovery of 2014. This discovery might only be important to me, but it is, nevertheless, important. They have a drink called the Ginger Cherry Limeade. Of course I ordered that drink, because cherry limeades are in my top ten list of favorite things. (This list also includes cats and bookstores, among other things.) The drink is served to you in a Mason jar and it is so pink and pretty. In fact, all of the drinks are served in Mason jars, and I really like that for some reason. Back to that drink, though - like any standard cherry limeade, you'll receive a slice of lime and a maraschino cherry. (My first drink had two cherries - oh, my lucky stars.) It was so pretty, I almost didn't want to drink it, but that didn't last for long. \\n\\nThis drink is what would happen if Sonic had the most glorious affair with a bar and that comingling resulted in a baby. Sure, I could go to Sonic during their happy hour, buy a cherry limeade, and pour some liquor in it, but it just wouldn't be the same. Frank has turned the cherry limeade into an art form - everything about that drink was bliss wrapped in heaven packaged in nirvana. I told everyone at the table I was going to marry that drink and I meant it. \\n\\nThe food was good, too. The poutine was yummy and combined three of my favorite things - fries, gravy, and cheese. I've never had real poutine and that makes me rather sad, but this was good and I would eat it again. In fact, it makes me excited for when I eat the real thing, because I'll only have eaten non-authentic poutine and when I finally taste the real thing, I imagine it will blow my g-d mind.

I've been hearing good things about Frank, and I was thinking it may be the ideal place to take my boyfriend for his 26th birthday.  He loves Chicago dogs and beer variety, but I still thought I should scope it out first during my lunch hour that day to prevent encountering any surprises.  \\n\\nIt was a gorgeous day .  I arrived around 1:15, and was greeted by the hostess.  She was quite pleasant, and offered a bar table for me to sit at.  I took a moment to study the types of beers they offered on the wall behind the bar and to take in the style of the restaurant (Neat designer ceiling fans, large windows, skylight)  The seating at the restaurant was about 45% full around this time.  A waiter promptly took my order and not too long after, my food was brought out.  I realized there was no silverware on the table, so I asked the hostess, and she went back to holler at my waiter who kindly followed up immediately.  \\n\\nThe chili was deliciously spicy, but the frank itself was unexceptional.  The waiter brought me refills of my drink without request, so I never saw the bottom of my glass.  At this point, I'm thinking 5 stars for chili, service, and ambiance, so I text the invite to my boyfriend's family and our friends to join us at Frank later that night.\\n\\nAfter gushing about this place, my boyfriend was pretty excited when we arrived there later that night.  My boyfriend fasted all day for this one meal and because he worked a late shift that day, we wound up getting there around 11:30 pm.  Our waiter asked us if we'd be dining, then reluctantly sat us, and came off rather curt while taking our drink order.  Bad night, maybe?  He came back with our drinks and asked us what we'd like to order.  Now, get this: my boyfriend orders a chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries for us to share and this MF-ing waiter has the nerve to scoff at this in front of his us, his customers!!!!  WTF?  What the F are you trying to say?  Okay, so something is seriously wrong with this individual.  Who the hell does that, really?  \\n\\nSo, my boyfriend is livid at this point, but his friends and family start trickling in because we had told them to meet us there.  We fill them in on the waiters bad attitude, but they quickly pick up on his stanky vibe anyway when he takes their orders.  We endure the horrible service for that first round, and decide to bounce to another bar as fast as everyone can down their drinks.  \\n\\nI am so embarrassed by the lack of consistency in the service.  It was because of all the praise that I gave this place based on the fantastic experience I had earlier that day that brought all our loved ones out there that night to endure such an UNPLEASANT experience.

Good food is easy to find in Atlanta. My striped bass was fine but from the annoying hostess to rushed service on a booked Sunday birthday party was a fiasco. \\nI booked my party for 10 people. During the same day my party was confirmed for 12 then quickly turned to 13. I called during the day before 5 pm, no answer. They never made a follow up call by the way. The hostess was so angry with me when I came with the news. (Reminder \\"empty\\" restaurant all the way till the closing time). She spoke to me quite ugly and in an intimidating way that it was my fault telling them it was only 10. So she didn't know if she could do anything about it!?  Then she said that she'd \\"try\\" to arrange it for 12. I actually was too uncomfortable breaking the news to her that it was going to be 13. She was so rude, told me and other friends that it was for only this time and the next time we'd be under a \\"contract\\"  if came with over 12 people. All she had to do is to pull very next 4 top table to combine with ours. Finally she ended up doing it (how simple it is). But of course before it's done she wasted our at least 5 mins of time running her mouth nonsense. (Reminder number 2; \\"empty\\" restaurant)\\n25 yrs in the industry some of us had been, we don't even know what she meant with that. And she harshly added, \\"it's  going to be %18 gratuity on your checks. I told her that \\"I don't care\\". She must have seen my eyes furiously staring at her, she continued \\"I'm not trying to anger you!\\" Oh I know girl! You're just putting me back on my place! \\nClearly, the girl had a wrong idea about her job description not to mention behavioral issues. \\nShe also snapped my friend who asked earlier if we 8 of us could go to the table while the rest of the party on their way(which was confirmed)  We could only sit at a 8 top with that 8 people.We weren't allowed to go to the table. Fine! Restaurant rules, especially when busy. Got it! But you don't spit out on costumer's face like that! There are so many different polite ways to handle this. But polite isn't in her dictionary. Too bad!\\nDuring the dinner the server was rushing us, he wanted to get out of there. It's Sunday, It's empty, I get that, too. But, do I have to tolerate that? Is it my problem now? Oh, is this because he poked me on my back with his server book while i was having a conversation with my friend to get my dinner order? He was too eager to get the order in, couldn't have patients so he had to poke me. \\nLater on grabbed my not done dinner plate first then asking if I was done, and immediately dropped a complimentary dessert mentioned that kitchen closed so he had to drop it now. \\nHonestly, I was really touched for a second, them bringing something complimentary and all, cause you wouldn't expect it after all. That also turned into disappointment quickly. It was a lil chocolate cup cake topped with a marsh mellow in a plate they wrote \\"happy birthday\\" with a chocolate sauce. Cute! As soon as I took a bite of it I had to take it out. It tasted like it's been sitting in the kitchen for over a week, not so fresh! Considering that, my server could have hold that on the kitchen table for 5 more minutes, right? Instead of dropping next to my dinner plate? YIKES! \\nIn the mean time while my friends looking at the dessert menu they received their checks before they asked for it.

With it being small and super popular comes a line before being seated. I would recommend checking in via the waitlist on here and visiting the other shops in the area while you kill time. However, the restaurant for the compact size and popularity is very efficient in managing the line as you are able to select your meal before you are seated in order for things to flow faster. From sitting down having a glass of water and the restaurant being full I had my food within 5 minutes piping hot and delicious. \\n\\nI think I have found a new favorite of mine as Ramen especially this time of the year when it's cold seems ideal for so many meals.

It is Friday night, but there were several times when we obviously could have been helped and weren't. It wasn't a terrible thing, since we were having good conversations, but it was definitely noticeable, and is the only reason I didn't give Alana's 5 stars. \\n\\nOkay so the food. WOW. So, we started off with bread baskets, of course, and since Lent is over, I allowed myself to try a piece of artisan bread, since the pieces were small. Served with oil, this was a nice touch, but personally if I'm going to eat bread, I prefer it to blow my mind... (you know that kind? omg). But, ain't no big thing. We also ordered three appetizers for the table - oysters (from MAINE!), scallops (the world's most perfect food) and shrimp. My favourite were definitely the scallops, but everything was excellent (horray for seafood in the Midwest not sucking!). Oh and we definitely had the chef/owner come and give us a sample of some sort of amazing pita with cheese on it. YUM. \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the fontina risotto. I do like that Alana's changes their menu all the time, and that is wonderful, but it also means the menu is quite limited. I would have preferred protein in my dinner, but since I didn't want trout (eww) or steak, there wasn't any other choice. However, the risotto, which came with grilled asparagus, was excellent. I also shared the frisee salad with a colleague, which was excellent - I'd consider ordering it as a dinner, with a few apps. \\n\\nOverall, between the seven of us, I think we ended up ordering every entree on the menu (I think there were only 4), and everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals (it's hard to tell when you're having such good convo). I know my risotto was heavenly - thick, cheesy, heavy... you know, completely decadent. Of course, I should have remembered to have the rest of it boxed up, but the server didn't ask me, so I missed that opportunity, le sigh. \\n\\nSome of the table got dessert;  I was still overwhelmed by the risotto incident, so I didn't try anything, but dessert definitely got the most audible reactions - the cherry pie in particular was a big hit. \\n\\nOh and I forgot to mention - my friend works here, and it was really nice to see him (kinda wish he was our server, because HE would have been on top of things); also, when we walked in the maitre'd (do people still use that term?) was SO excited about my Maine tattoo and struck up a really nice conversation with me about Pemaquid (where the oysters were from). It was very genuine, and I really appreciated it, because most people who bring up Maine are completely obnoxious and try to imitate our accent or have only been to Bar Harbor and completely base their idea of Maine on the ultimate tourist trap - but this guy's genuine affection for the time he spent in my home state really set up a really warm, cozy, and intimate tone to the whole experience. \\n\\nAlana's seems very romantic. I'd like to come back here sometime with the boy or a close friend, and just have a nice, dreamy dinner for two. Or maybe I'll try to impress my momma when she comes to visit in a few weeks. This is defintely one of those casual yet upscale places that is the perfect cross between high cuisine and relaxed yet classy atmosphere. It's one of those places where you pay $22.00 for an entree and it's worth every penny. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back here. Hopefully ASAP."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Cool little place with fantastic food. Great pizza and service.

The bacon was delicious, but the hype really left me feeling disappointed.\\n\\nThe line is ridiculous at this place.  I didn't enjoy the doughnuts that much the first time, but we had to go there again to get some to bring back for our friends and families.  That time we waited in the rain and it was just really shitty.  \\n\\nThe person at the counter on the second day had a bad attitude.  She couldn't pick the doughnuts up or it stuck to the paper and she just threw it really hard against the wall to hit what I assume is the garbage can.  I get that she's under a lot of pressure, but it was frightening.  \\n\\nI got the Voodoo dozen, which is when they pick the doughnuts for you.  How the hell did I not get a single doughnut I wanted?  That was epic fail.  Thankfully I did enjoy the filled doughnut with cream and chocolate glaze on the outside.   Still, I prefer the texture of Krispy Kream doughnuts.. they're a lot more fluffy and don't taste all doughy.  \\n\\nGo here at like 2 am, the line isn't as ridiculous, and it will taste better because you're probably going there after a night of drunken debauchery."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Oysters were great but the service was awful. Wait staff was very friendly but they brought us hot shrimp instead of the requested cold, raw oysters took 30 minutes to come out due to some alleged miscommunication between the wait staff, and we had to wait 15 minutes for the check. Probably won't be back. Have heard that sitting at the bar will get you faster service, but we couldn't sit at the bar because a member of our party is disabled. Speaking of which, the restaurant is largely inaccessible to the handicapped -- don't think a person in a wheelchair would be able to use the restroom. Finally, shrimp and fish were decent but nothing to write home about."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I personally was not super impressed by this restaurant. With all the hype I was expecting something a little more civilized with top notch food. The clam chowder and lobster was incredible but everything else including the oysters I thought was quite average for the big amount you spend. The reason for the 4 star is because it was sooo cramped in there. Honestly wish there was an option for 3.5 stars. Even with the good lobster and soup I felt like it was a bit hard to enjoy as there was just no personal space while eating. So overall I'd say good for lobster and clam chowder but don't go to the top floor of seating, Way too cramped and the rest of the food was just alright."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, wow, wow.... yes, that's three, count'em three wows.

Everyone smiled at us and greeted us as we were seated, second good sign.  Our server was quite delightful and helped us out with the menu items since it was our first time (third good sign).\\n\\nThe food here is nothing short of amazing.  If I were to ever move to Portland I would have to move to Clinton St. or somewhere near it so I could have my regular fix.  The food here is comfort all the way with what seems to be a more contemporary take on Scandinavian food but paying homage to the traditions.\\n\\nAn excellent experience through and through.

For 5.95 you get butter chicken, rice, naan, salad, and a veggie curry.  Easily enough for 2 meals.\\n\\nThe food is tasty, but not always consistent.  I think they serve the take out containers from the lunch buffet usually, but I once got butter chicken that was stone cold, while the other dishes were proper temperature.

We soon realized, however, that the table wouldn't accommodate us all... it turned out they arranged the table for a few less than we had asked for.  They apologized, moved things around, and made it work for us. \\n\\nThe food was quite good.  I had arroz con pato (rice with duck), and enjoyed it a lot. I also had half of maybe the best empanada I've ever had, a nicely done scallop.  I also had a couple bites of an ice cream made from the national fruit of Peru- it really didn't taste fruity at all but more vanilla-caramel-y."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If you are ever in Boston and in the mood for fine dining, I have just the place!\\n\\nLet me start by saying that the view of Boston from Top of the Hub is absolutely stunning. The restaurant is located on the 52nd floor at the Prudential Tower.\\n\\nThe best live jazz in the city (self-proclaimed by the restaurant) will accompany you while you enjoy the view and, of course, your food.  You can order √† la carte or opt for the 3-course dinner menu for a set price.\\n\\nMy main dish was a braised lamb shank with whipped potatoes, fruit compote, and roasted garlic. Simply delicious.\\n\\nMy date for the night (my mother) decided to go with the Vermont misty knolls chicken with English peas, shallots, soubise (a thick, white sauce made with onion pur√©e), and sea salt roasted fingerling potatoes. I had the pleasure of sampling her food and it was also to my liking. I think it was the soubise sauce that won me over.\\n\\nAgain, I highly recommend Top of the Hub, especially for couples, formal dinners, or even just a night out on the town."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is amazing! The feel is vibrant, lively and this place feels truly authentic for Peruvian food. The service is worthy of noting - the place was packed but we still felt like we had personal attention. The fact that it was packed meant that we waited to have a table a little later than we wanted. We showed up early for our reservation and were seated not until a little after reservation time but felt that the staff was making every accommodation to accommodate that - we got an excellent table!

I asked her opinion on a few dishes and she recommended the bacon and eggs combo, mainly because she said the bacon was delicious. Sure enough, the bacon was super tasty, and they had this smoked chipotle Tabasco sauce that went very well with the eggs. The only weak point was that the toast was slightly soggy. It still tasted lovely with the raspberry jam, though. They also had a shiny antique Cadillac inside the place  which, in combination with the Christmas decorations at the time, made for a classic, quaint environment.

Flavors surprisingly delightful, decor an interesting and well-appointed modern take on traditional Scandinavian interiors, the only complaints being the crammed-in feel and the wait.  The second time we went, we brought my parents in the interest of showing them great breakfast food in Portland and came away frankly embarrassed.\\n\\nThe cheap speakers were screaming so loudly I couldn't hear the people at my table.  I said to a waiter, \\"This is really loud.\\"  He replied \\"it's always this loud!\\" with a horsey laugh.  I told him I couldn't hear myself.  He didn't say anything - poor attitude - but shortly thereafter the music got slightly quieter.  \\n\\nThat left the problem of the crowding.  broder knows they have a tiny space - either embrace it and remove a table or move into a larger space.  The empty tavern next door where everyone waits their hour and a half for a table could probably use the trade.  As it was, I could hear the stranger next to me far better than the person sitting across from me.\\n\\nTwo of our four dishes were good; the remaining two were middlin'.  One hash was overcooked and far too salty, the other lacked flavor.  If it weren't for the remaining two I'd have said they'd abandoned their values completely.  \\n\\nOne of our party ordered orange juice which he turned down when it arrived because it tasted and smelled \\"off.\\"  The waiter, thinking he was asking for a fresh glass of juice, brought over the gallon jug he was pouring it out of.  It's the extremely cheap brand sold at Fred Meyer in the jugs that look like milk gallons.
