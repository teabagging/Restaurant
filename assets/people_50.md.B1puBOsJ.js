I had been once before and had a pretty good experience overall: no wait, good staff, tasty food, decent prices. All of the key components for a nice brunch.  \\n\\nWe arrived around 1030a and it was pretty dead, just one or two tables of newspaper-reading coffee drinker types. We sat outside on the covered patio since it was a gorgeous breezy morning and not too hot yet. \\n\\nService: Our waitress came right away with the menus but took forever to do every other thing the whole time we were there. \\n\\nMenu: All the delicious regular brunch fare....with many options for french toast, from butterscotch to raspberry jelly-filled; eggs any way you like them, homestyle potatoes, omelets with lots of ingredient options; and a yummy-sounding yogurt parfait thing that I am definitely trying next time.  \\n\\nWhat we got: I got eggs over-easy that came with homestyle potatoes and a fluffy biscuit with a honey glaze on top (being a true Southerner, I am very discerning when it comes to biscuits). All delicious, especially the potatoes, which are cut in chunky pieces and cooked with herbs and onions and and make for a savory side dish. My dad and boyfriend both got omelets which each came with the potatoes and toast, I think, and my mom got the raspberry jelly filled french toast. They all seemed pretty happy except that Mom had to send back her original french toast because they put strawberries on top and she's allergic.   \\n\\nBad stuff: Our waitress was not really knowledgeable about anything; like when my dad and boyfriend ordered a side of potatoes to split, she should have said that their omelets came with them already (it did not say that on the menu, and the french toast doesn't have sides listed, and doesn't come with any), instead of letting us order extra. And again, she took forever to do everything. There was another table who came in after us who had a different waitress, and got everything (drinks, food, bill) at least 10 minutes before we did. The manager did come out to check on us after Mom sent back the french toast, but it seemed like our waitress had told on us or something because the manager seemed worried about us being unhappy. Also, we didn't get the Fruit Loops/Corn Pops munchie bowl this time like we did when I went before.\\n\\nGood stuff: The food is delicious. That's a big selling point obviously, and definitely overshadows the bad service thing. Prices are not bad, I would say two people could have brunch for $30 or so including tip. Not too crowded, although it was filling up when we were leaving a little before noon. I think people just don't know about it since it's kind of in a random location, although not too far down past Figo. \\n\\nAll in all, I really like it and I'd go back again for round three."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks","address":"1123 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't have a bad thing to say about this place.

It was busy, but we had no problem finding a place to sit. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on beer and was able to surprise us with some good local flavors.\\n\\nOur food was wonderful. I love avocado so it was only natural that I had the chicken fried avocado and it was delicious. I don't think I would even try anything else on the menu after having that. My hubby had a fish sandwich and said it was good. Two of my kids had bacon cheeseburgers and said they were really good; not the best they've had, but good. My other kiddo had the Lone Star chicken sandwich and said it was the best chicken sandwich he's ever had. \\n\\nThe bathrooms were clean and that's a big deal to me. From what my hubby told me, maybe the men's restroom was not the most suitable for young boys. We're pretty open with our kids though so it didn't bother our family.\\n\\nOverall this place was a great experience.

And yes, this is a 5 star review.  Why?  Because every time I am here (which is almost every time that I fly through ATL) I enjoy the calm atmosphere, attentive service, good food and very good coffee.  I am almost always here at breakfast time, and I much prefer a nice place to sit than a quick meal from a food court walk-through.  The only negative about Care Intermezzo is when you check in at the host stand:  you almost always find the person working there staring down at their phone.  If so, clear your throat, get their attention, and asked to be seated inside (as opposed to the \\"outside\\" tables on your right).  Inside you will find tables close together, but in an environment that is fairly inviting for an airport.  From the glass windows overlooking the runway, to the books along one wall and TV screens on the other, you feel like you've left the hustle of the airport.  \\n\\nThe menu covers all the bases, but I always find myself drawn to the omelettes (usually the Americana).  Tasty, good sized, using fresh ingredients.  And both the potatoes and fruit side choices are good (but I usually avoid the toast as it comes out limp and under-toasted).  And you will be happy if you are a coffee drinker:  the coffee is strong and hot and served in your own pitcher (which has between 3-4 cups).  All in all, one of my favorite breakfast stops when traveling.

The service was also incredibly slow and the actors that came around the tables were more annoying than entertaining. \\n\\nI can't say that I will come back here except if I am just getting a desert. \\n\\nTLDR: just don't get the veggie pasta"},{"name":"Michael's Restaurant","address":"208 Fitchburg Tpke","city":"Concord","stars":"2.5","text":"Love this place.

The food is just alright, but my big problem with Doc's is the service.\\n\\nI have been in the service industry for my entire adult life, so bad service is VERY obvious to me, and quite particularly the other night, when I got NO service.  Thank the stars for bartenders, or I would NEVER go back here.\\n\\nI made a load of money during SXSW.  Like, $$$$$ BALLIN'.  Since it ended, I had been going out to bars, restaurants, and coffeeshops and spreading the love to fellow industry workers with 100+% tips.  I came in fully intending to make a server's night.  The patio was full, so I grabbed a beer from the bar and waited for a table to open up; didn't take long before I had a spot.  Granted, I'm sitting at a table with a full beer; it looks like maybe I've been served already which would make sense to not be greeted if they were rotating tables - but they were not.  They had server sections.  My table had been cleared of all but the previous customers' check.  After about 5 minutes of sitting and waiting, a server stopped by, grabbed the check, but would not even look at me.  FIVE servers passed around me for over 20 minutes without a word or even a smile.  (I should mention here that in my experience as a server, EVERYONE is your customer, whether they're at your table or not.)  I'm STARVING, and now I'm out of beer.  I figure, okay, give it 5 more minutes, maybe someone will see the empty beer and a light will go off.  I'm making eye contact and even trying to flag down any server who flits by me; NOTHING.  I finally gave up and ordered from the bar.  But the horror didn't end there!!  At the bar, the female bartender only looked up at me and then went back to printing out checks (a smile and \\"Someone will be right with you\\" goes a long way, people.)  Finally the male bartender came back and took my order.  When I told him about not receiving service at the table, he didn't acknowledge or apologize.  Once my food arrived, I was only 3 bites in when an SA came by and tried to start clearing the condiments and extra plate I'd been given.  Like whoa dude, calm your tits, I ain't even opened that ketchup yet.\\n\\nHonestly, this is not the first time something like this has happened here.

The food is variable, some things are fine, some things are so-so, most things are overpriced, like $10.95 for a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my reason for writing this review.  I had dinner there with my parents last night, my mom and I both ordered grilled cheese, I ordered mine on light rye, she ordered hers on white without bacon and with all Swiss cheese, it usually comes with Swiss and cheddar.  I'm not a huge fan of Swiss but I do like it melted and combined with other cheeses.  It was the worst grilled cheese I have ever eaten, I finished half of it only by dunking it in the Au jus that came with my dad's brisket.  I took the other half home thinking maybe my son would eat it. \\n\\nI just opened it up to slap on some American cheese and re-grill it because I really wanted it and I thought that might make it better, imagine my surprise to find that mine had been made with all Swiss, no wonder I hated it, that's way too much Swiss for me.  I called and spoke to a manager named Mike and told him the issue. This is the first time in my life I have ever called with a specific complaint about food, telling the manager I had half of it left (not to mention telling him I live around the corner) and not had an offer to remake the food.  \\n\\nI worked in restaurants for many years, server, cook and management and this to me is unconscionable. I will do my best to encourage my elderly parents to get out of their comfort zone and go somewhere else in the future.

They had various flavored water type drinks plus a free water bar with warm, cold and fizzy waters. The bill with tax was $10.50. \\n\\nThe food arrived quickly. It included 5 or 6 small fried chickpea balls (I believe these are also known as falafel, unless that has a different recipe). Each about an inch diameter. There was also 3-4 oz each of hummus, cucumber tomato carrot and pickled onion salad and something with what seemed to be tiny black beans (like 1/8\\" across) with raisins. Finally there was a small plastic container with a tablespoon or so of tahini. The pita was about five inches across thick and most important warm. This was certainly filling though not enormous. \\n\\nThe food was very good. Certainly fresh. I never said \\"oh my god-wow\\" but certainly worthy of going again when I'm in the area. \\n\\nMy only dislike was the open kitchen. Kind of cool to see the cooking and know what was done with my food. However it was maybe too close. The food prep area was right on the other side of the not very wide eating counter and the preparer being that close right in front of me was a bit off putting."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Love the crowd and the location... food was ok at best... but what I really loved was this drink called the  \\"bubble bath\\" Please try it when you go."},{"name":"Luke's Inside Out","address":"1109 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best sammich....ever.

Covers are either cheap or non-existent, and drink specials accompany most events.\\n\\nOverall: Red Cap is a good place to spend time when you're on the west side of the city, either as a cheap afternoon or after-work hangout, or as a place to dance and drink on the weekends."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I hear the breakfast/brunch is delish, but I came for dinner. \\n- Complimentary bagel chips to start were nice\\n- Sandwiches were served with half sour pickles (basically slimy cucumber status) I would have greatly appreciated a choice between full sour and half sour pickle\\n- Ordered pastrami and swiss - bread was great, decent serving of pastrami, and the potato salad was good, but nothing was amazing.

We most bemoan the dearth of Chicago style pizza and ribs, Swedish bakery, perfect pasta, and, perhaps surprisingly, Greek cuisine.\\n\\nThe Greek Corner almost fills the void, and in some ways surpasses what I remember enjoying years ago.\\n\\nThat is not to say everything is \\"fresh\\" and made there, but it is to say that most items are made in-house, and those items shine brightly.\\n\\nThe lamb shank (braised lamb) is notable for fall-off-the-bone meat in a slow-cook with ideal, fresh spices.  In my opinion, it's the best item on the menu and in many visits, I find myself returning to it, despite a prior resolve to eat something more lean.  :-)\\n\\nI read a lot of praise for the gyros here, but the meat is not their own.  It's a spit of pressed lamb and beef from a restaurant supplier.  Granted, it's of very good quality, and not over-salted (a frequent problem with such pre-pressed gyros).\\n\\nBut in addition to being a commercial product, I have a couple of other problems with it -- I prefer that it be sliced thinner, and cooked to a much finer crisp, than the thick slices The Greek Corner serves.  But in their defense, the slicing thickness can be rectified by asking for this type of preparation.\\n\\nThe way you'll usually see gyros served in Greece, when you can find them (they tend to be more popular here, I think), is as homemade, home-spiced, pressed lamb (not a blend with beef) or another single meat, cooked on a spit next to hot flame, sliced thin and crispy.  It's then served over raw onion on a plate.  Pita is on the side, along with tzaziki. It's simple because the lamb is the highlight. \\n\\nI get into the gyro issue because it's the one menu item people think about for every Greek place.  It's what everyone expects to find, but few people seem to have had gyros actually made from solely lamb, made and pressed right in the restaurant -- what people eat, almost without fail, is the commercial stuff.\\n\\nBecause The Greek Corner uses such a good grade of the commercial meat, I really don't have a huge problem with this -- it's still pretty good.  But I remain in my search for somewhere that does this item as it should be done.\\n\\nBut onward past the gyro rant.  Greek-lemon soup is nicely tart and perfectly thickened.  You'll get a little packed of oyster crackers on the side, which sorta cheapens the appearance of what is a really great soup.\\n\\nSaganaki cheese is huge with me, and theirs is good, even if i can't really remember ever seeing it arrive in flames.  (The ceiling's too low to do it inside.)  It's a good grade of cheese, although I do think it comes pre-breaded.  Still pretty good.\\n\\nSpanakopita is superb here, with a mild cheese and well-cooked, well-chopped spinach inside.  The layers of filo dough are done beautifully, and have the right consistency.  This is really a great choice, and typically a huge favorite of Greek food fans.\\n\\nTzaziki matters.  And it matters to The Greek Corner where it's made fresh and wonderfully understated -- not overly acidic but with a nice zip of lemon, not overly dilled, and definitely not overly filled with wet cucumber chunks (a rookie mistake in tzaziki).  The Greek Corner might have better tzaziki than I've ever had -- it's creamy without being too oily.  It's marvelous.  Come for lunch and just dine on tzaziki and pita and some Mediterranean olives...  you'll be fully sated.\\n\\nBaklava here shows the same care in the layers of filo sheets as the spanakopita does.  The nuts are ample and the honey might be something a bit more wild than clear clover honey.  I notice a distinct flavor that really makes it stand out.  Again, house made top-to-bottom.\\n\\nI've had good experiences with grilled whitefish here.  This is more like what I typically find on a Greek isle, where fish and shellfish are more common than what we see on the American menus.\\n\\nThe stuffed chicken is so full of flavor that I might warn folks to steer toward something they know if they are not too adventurous in flavor -- I am, and I think this is indeed a well made, tender chicken with all the right goodies pouring out of it.\\n\\nThis isn't the place for wine, but there are a couple of Greek beers, which are canned, but good.\\n\\nFor what it is -- a great family Greek restaurant in a good location, a cute place, and with a lot of care in their mostly house-made ingredients, this place is a solid 4-Star.  \\n\\nI base that mostly on the food and (relatively good) service, along with a good view of the avenue, park, and a bit of the lake.  I'm not totally sure that making their own gyro meat would kick it up to a full 5-Star, but it might get me pretty close.\\n\\nJust go there.  And don't be afraid of the gyros.  They're very, very good.  \\n\\nI'm just a bit spoiled from having them house-made from single-meat lamb for so long. But then, there are plenty more things on their great menu to spoil myself with."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Very nice atmosphere and a great food.

It is located in Inman Square and parking is best found along Cambridge St, but it is also a relatively short walk from the Central Square T stop.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive and every dish so far has been excellent. Their \\"hot\\" is actually hot, unlike many other Indian restaurants, so order your heat level appropriately.

If you are an Indian food fan and have tried other Indian restaurants in the area, it is well worth trying Punjabi Dhaba.

Boston people love dive bars so this would be the restaurant equivalent. \\n\\nI have wandered by this place a few times but its usually stupendously packed (it can only seat about 10 people) so I simply go to the very good Indian place right down the street. However one day they were empty and I was hungry so I figured I would give it a shot. When I first walked in it actually reminded me of a truly authentic Indian place. Its in a small, well worn space with a seating area about the size of an average bedroom. There were various plastic cups labeled \\"lassi\\" in the fridge, a bucket of anise seeds sitting on a shelf and a menu full of dishes with no explanation as to what they actually are. However it didn't take long to realize there are some serious differences. First is the supremely high prices, true Indian food is dirt cheap bordering on free. Second, there were no flies buzzing around which are essential to the true Indian experience.  Third, there was a large prominent tip jar on the counter which I found hilarious considering the service is some of the worst you will find. And finally, when my food did come out, instead of being on a banana leaf like its supposed to , it comes out on a steel Korean War surplus food tray. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good (although you really can't screw up Indian food as long as you stick to vegetarian) and came out quickly but other than that it wasn't anything special. There are plenty of other Indian options in the city that are much better. This place is unique though in that you can get an idea of what the true Indian dining experience is really like.

I'm not a huge lobster fan but I love all seafoods but I was impressed. This is not a Ruthe Chris so don't expect the best but I thought the Lobsters were great for the price I paid. My boyfriend and I had 2 lobsters each and probably 10 clusters of crab legs and a pile of mussels. The waitress offered us Lobster bisque that is part of the All You Can Eat menu but not at the bar. She was fabulous. I never once had to ask for a refill and she had my shells cleared and my bowl empty every time by the time I came back from the buffet.

But since the cafe is so small, there are no public restrooms, which is also why it isn't a very good study spot. You fill yourself up with boba tea, but you can't concentrate on studying because you need to pee. Eventually we had to go elsewhere because I needed to use a restroom. Anyway, I ordered the coconut taro boba tea. That one seemed to be popular, as I heard several other customers order the same thing after me. It was pretty good. The tapioca pearls seemed a little over-cooked, but it wasn't too bad. I tend to like my tapioca pearls more firm instead of mushy, but I like to assume that maybe I just got an overcooked batch.

He picked up a slice of the southern brown butter pecan, a slice of cherry crumb, and a small apple pear cranberry (a favorite blend of his as perfected by our second most frequented pie shop back home). As you can probably infer, we like pie. Pie rarely stands a chance in our presence, and leftovers are unheard of.  \\n\\nWe found Petsi Pies to be kind of bland. The pie crust was just ok, nothing special or standout about it. The filling on the two fruit pies was also pretty mediocre, not much greater than grocery store pies. The best of the three pies was the pecan, which is funny because I normally don't even eat pecan pie. After sampling the pies, it took about 3 days for the pies to be eaten, two of which were weekend days so we were actually at home NOT eating pie as it sat right out in the open on our dining room table.\\n\\nMaybe the other pastries are better, but the name of the shop has the word \\"pies\\" right in it so....

I was sold on the beautiful french decor alone. Upon inquiring, she said they had the best breakfast in town. Well then! Being that breakfast is my favorite meal, I had to get a group together and try this chi-chi restaurant out myself! Thank God I made a reservation because the place was packed when we arrived this morning! Not only did I get a parking spot in the street within a block (normally hard to do downtown no matter where you're going) but they seated us immediately. I was worried, because I was told they wouldn't seat us until our entire group arrived...and I was running late - which means my friends would be stuck standing around waiting for me - but that didn't turn out to be true. My friends were seated and engrossed in their menu when I got there. For starters, our waitress rocked! I didn't get her name, but she's medium to tall (hard to tell when you are seated and they're standing over you) has brown hair and Dolly Parton's figure (the upper half). I know that sounds crass, but it's the most accurate description I can give considering I was busy studying my menu then busy eating and drinking every time she came around. I was going to order the Bloody Mary but she talked me into the Man-mosa (the large Mimosa). She did not steer me wrong! It was twice the size of the regular (which is $8) but didn't cost twice the price (it was $12). It was also made with fresh squeezed orange juice and just one made me tipsy. I made the mistake of ordering a regular breakfast (bacon, eggs, toast) - which would have been great had my friend to the right not ordered the most glorious french toast I'd ever seen! (their Crunchy French Toast) Luckily, she let me eat some of hers...after I ravished my own plate. We asked our awesome waitress to take a group photo and she not only kindly smiled about it (instead of rolling her eyes - like some servers do) but insisted on taking a couple shots, to make sure we got a good one. This place has great customer service and their staff knows how to get a good tip out of a person! I can't wait to go back and try the biscuits and gravy! I know I should get the Crunchy French Toast, but I'm banking on another friend to order that so I can eat my own then nibble off theirs."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The overall theme of this restaurant is unbelievable.

I ordered the teriyaki salmon hoping for a portion of fish in a sticky teriyaki sauce with fresh veggies and a mound of Asian white rice. Unfortunately it was like a bowl of soup with rice, fish and veggies. Also peppery. The fettuccini Alfredo was acceptable. The real novelty here are the milkshakes. They are out of this world.

You'll find that you can slip through to the counter pretty easily, where you'll like be helped pretty quickly (I think I only waited 5-7 minutes).\\n\\nBecause of the amount of people in the joint, I couldn't even see half the goods that they make there!  I hesistated on the cannoli (I've already had cannoli and do love them), and I still regret not getting one (or 5), especially after reading the reviews of my fellow Yelpers (note to self: ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS FIRST!).\\n\\nLet's talk about what I did get:\\n\\nAnise biscotti - good, but not amazingly better than others I've had\\nAlmond-cluster cookie thing - really good\\nAnise drop - good, but very licorice-y (if you're into that kind of thing - my boyfriend was NOT)\\n\\nand the star of the day:\\n\\nLobster tail - a giant confection as big as my forearm (literally), stuffed with the same amazing sweet-ricotta goodness they stuff the cannolis with (I'm assuming).  Um.  Amazing.  It was wrong - so wrong.  But so good.  So so so so so so good.  \\n\\nSo that's my visit to Mike's.  I loved it.  I can understand why people would say it is a tourist trap, but I completely disagree.  Just because something is so amazing that everyone recommends it to their friends and family doesn't mean that it's a tourist trap. I never felt like there was any compromised quality due to the amount of people in the joint (which was A LOT).  So all you haters out there, quit hatin'.  Mike's is the bomb and you'll simply have to learn to accept it."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite doughnut shops to go to!

I wanted to try a cafe within the shops, but they were closed for the day despite their hours saying otherwise. In any case, you can enjoy a beautiful view of the lake and also take some glamour shots with the restaurant balconies as the backdrop. The entrance and interior dining/bar is decorated fabulously with some really quirky 50's wax statues (think Betty Boop or some weird old scarecrow lady and lots of neon lights) You can sit anywhere outside and still get that amazing view of the lake. It was a bit chilly and soft drizzle of rain but it went away by the end of our dine in experience. The staff were very friendly and the food actually didn't take long as we were expecting it to due to the reviews on yelp..! I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and it was out of this world!! I got extra guacamole from my sisters plate who ordered fish tacos and my dad ordered a classic cheeseburger which was not bad! The meat was pretty juicy despite the burgers looking charred!! My veggie burger was super tender and had a unique flavor and to my surprise extremely tasty! I stuffed it with sweet potato and guac with ketchup and it turned out perfect for me..! It was a very good portion size too. They serve you drinks in souvenir cups that say Oasis tx etc. sadly I forgot to take mine! Oh yeah, they also have railing on the stairs filled with heart-shaped padlocks much like the famous France 'padlocks of love', so if you are into that sort of thing, don't forget to bring a padlock!

So after waiting a little while, we got our table and ordered drinks, chips and salsa and guacamole, and fish tacos.  Like my sister said, the food is mediocre at best, but this place is not about the food, just about enjoying the sunset and the lovely Lake Travis. \\n\\nFirst of all, this place is ginormous!  It consists of four stories I believe.  They must have hundreds of workers being that there's a good bit of indoor and outdoor seating.  Being that this place is so big and crowded, I'm sure the servers get overwhelmed all the time, which causes the service to be very lacking, as we had first-hand experience.  Our server seemed to keep forgetting about us and it took forever just to get the few items we ordered.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend eating elsewhere before coming to The Oasis.

Coming from NYC, Ive had cannolis all my life and really this place has the second best cannoli Ive ever had...\\n\\nI would however skip all the hype and just get a plain or maybe chocolate chip cannoli. There are like roughly 8 or 9 different types of cannolis and Ive had them all... not really worth it trying them all btw.\\n\\nThe problem with the shop however is the amount of people there, from tourists to locals to tour groups... there are just people there ALL THE TIME. Sometimes on the weekends Ive seen the line GO AROUND THE BLOCK. That is a serious problem in my book but if you go on a weekday in the winter... and you happen in on a full shop without a line coming out, and you have patience, it is definitely worth the wait.

This is where I had my first meal and have since revisited twice. I've only had breakfast and coffee.\\n\\nAmbience: First impression was of some signage telling me no complaining allowed, which was a touch disappointing because that's exactly the kind of thing I would do with my mother over three hours and six pots of coffee in a place like this. The interior looks like a dollhouse. Smells like the cosy countryside cottage of a mother in law who actually likes you and wants nothing more than to hear you ask for another helping of her cooking. It's likely that in years to come I shall misremember some additional bay windows, day beds, possibly a view of an English rose garden. \\n\\nBeverages: Was not yet aware of the \\"Portland coffee\\" thing, and this being my first cup in Portland, I was blown away by the Eleven of Spades. They also have mint tea that is brewed with very fresh mint leaves. \\n\\nFood: I've tried the Grilled Portabella Mushroom Scramble, Omelet Du Jour (bacon, cheese, some other stuff) and Mike's Special Scramble. Also a single egg over easy, which I ordered to avoid tempting judgement for ordering nothing but three pots of coffee for breakfast. The food appears to be cooked in a generous amount of oil, which I enjoyed. The dishes were solid, satisfying, reliable, comforting, which seems to be exactly what they were going for.\\n\\nService: This is the reason I intend to keep revisiting. I am hitting that age where there is a palpable and unfavorable shift in the \\"miss\\":\\"ma'am\\" ratio (alongside shifts in other ratios too), so it's a nice experience to sit down in a sunny dollhouse and be called \\"hun\\"and have my shoulder touched when I say something \\"adorable\\". Shauna and Amanda were sweet, attentive, motherly of course, and made me feel warm and fuzzy. My friend and I came here once in the late afternoon for \\"just coffee and tea\\" and chose to sit outside.

I wished they had those Thai doughnuts or banana spring rolls that most Thai restaurants serve though. That's what I always think of when I think of Thai desserts. \\n\\nOverall, we both enjoyed the meal and the drinks.

It was good, what I didn't like was the meat. I hate when I have to over chew my meat and I kept having to do that.

(Unless it's bacon!)\\n- Korean Chicken Wings with Fresh Kimchee and Soy Glaze.. Pretty good.  Wish the wings had more glaze on it but it was the perfect crispiness.\\n- Garlic-Chili Braised Octopus.. loved this.  Octopus was cooked perfectly and the flavors melded really well together.\\n- Dan Dan Noodles.. should've ordered another one.  Needed more carbs and was delicious haha\\n- Salt and Pepper Shrimp... probably my favorite dish of the night.  Enormous shrimp\\n- Duck Lettuce Wraps.. Not a big fan.  Special for the night\\n- Crab Rangoons.. they were ok.  Nothing too special.\\n- and The Cookie for dessert... yum!! Fresh out of the oven with ice cream and caramel on top.  Sooo good\\n\\nDrinks were ok.  The margarita my friend ordered was basically un-drinkable.  It was so sour to the point that you pucker your entire face.  The Dragon Bowl is fun when you are with a group of people.. or even 2 people on a date or something.\\n\\nService was great.  Our server and the busser were pretty attentive.

The host came out of the bar and asked if we wanted to order from the menu or go \\"on market\\" (which I guess is an upscale attempt at code for \\"buffet\\"). We did look the menu over but the best deal seemed to be the \\"market\\" since it included a drink (the $7.99 deal).\\n\\nThe \\"market\\" is a strange set up. There were two pastas (that day it was ziti in a bolognese sauce and angel hair with roasted garlic, oil you had to add yourself), a vegetable soup, and salad. The salad was finely shredded lettuce and three dressing to choose from. That was it. Weird.\\n\\nHere comes the truly weird part. The sign is not really true. No pizza on the buffet. They tell you what three pizzas they have that day (on our day it was meatball, mushroom or cheese) and your server gets it for you in the kitchen. And the slices are TINY. When our server said the slices were small, she wasn't kidding. They must slice a normal-size slice into three slivers. To me, this comes off as an attempt to discourage true \\"all you can eat\\" pizza. They also bring it out on thin, single paper plates in contrast to the heavy dinnerware they use otherwise. What's with that? \\n\\nThe food itself was okay, nothing exciting. The sausage in the bolognese sauce had a nice kick I was not expecting. The angel hair pasta with roasted garlic required oil and you had to add that yourself. It was quite bland. The pizza was decent, from what I could tell from the slivers of cheese I had. But nothing outstanding. \\n\\nThe actual restaurant is nicely decorated and our waitress was attentive enough. I did notice that the prices for entrees were a on the high side for lunch. Having tried the two pastas, if they are any indication, the prices don't seem to match the quality of the food. And I am quite willing to pay for good pasta. \\n\\nWhile Capozzi's was okay, I think I'll return to Athens Pizza, where I know I can actually get an entire slice of pizza on a real plate."},{"name":"Czar Ice Bar","address":"56 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place rocks.

I then called again and was told by the woman answering the phone that the roll I had ordered was meant for a sophisticated palate and for people who are very versed in eating raw fish. She did not actually say this to me with such eloquence, but for the sake of this post, that sums it up. She mentioned that the manager would offer me $5 off my next visit. The roll was $16. I then asked to speak with the manager who then argued with me for quite some time, challenged my claim, insulted my knowledge of sushi (which I eat probably 4x a week, and most usually sashimi not nigiri or rolls). He was unwilling to offer me more than $5 off and was as rude and rude gets. I would not recommend supporting an establishment that offers such poor customer service.

We've been to Ray's over 2-dozen times in the past 14 years and think we have a pretty good handle on their restaurant. \\n\\nFirst off, we started going to Ray's while dating, and now go to Ray's to have a nice meal in a beautiful setting.  On many days, the ducks are walking about, and canoes are traveling down the river, a serene setting. It's always been about the ambiance when we go to Ray's. \\n\\nOver the years we have always commented to each other about their slow, slow service. As you read other reviews, you'll notice this is a theme but again, it's a romantic setting so you get what you want what you pay for. \\n\\nOn May 10 we were happily surprised as the service was rather impressive. This was new for us. Ray's used a front and back waiter, a busboy, and even a beverage server. The service aspect was refreshing and I hope Ray's keeps this up. \\n\\nBeing fans of Ray's, we know our tab is going to exceed $100 for two and we know their food portions are on the small side and accept that, as the quality and preparation of the food is always stellar. \\n\\nThis particular evening I decided to try their  \\"Hand-cut Delmonico Ribeye\\" for $40. I was in the mood for a nice, thick cut steak.  When I order a steak at any restaurant I expect perfection, and at $40, I expected a top end steak.  I have to add, I copied and pasted the following from Ray's own menu: \\"top quality Midwestern corn-fed beef. We hand-select the finest Black Angus in the United States. Aged a minimum of 21 days to insure flavor and tenderness\\"  \\n\\nMy steaks appearance was skimpy. It was a ¬æ\\" thin cut, of what looked like a low-grade beef, or a grocery store steak that was aged from sitting too long in the meat cooler.  I grimaced but kept my composure, as I'm sure it had to taste spectacular.  I always order my steak medium-rare, and this evening was no exception. I expected a mouth-watering, flavor rich bite but that wasn't the case. This \\"steak\\" was a huge let down, mediocre at best and that's being extremely kind. Usually I would send something like this back to the kitchen but this was a long over date night with my wife and I didn't want to ruin the evening; and it would have. With this stated, I must say to all readers of this review, do NOT get the  \\"Hand-cut Delmonico Ribeye\\" at Ray's. If you want a $40 steak, go to Morton's or the Palm and get a 2-3\\" steak that'll satisfy any meat lover's thirst. \\n\\nI must be fair to Ray's and add my wife had their prime rib on this evening and it looked and tasted, as a fine cut of beef should. I also have to point out the appetizers, soup, as well as out dessert were all excellent and prepared as expected. We will go back to Ray's once I let this go, but I need time to heal that tasteless steak experience, so maybe in 2015. As for our next visit, I'll be sure to stay clear of their steaks and have my old standby, their Horseradish Crusted Grouper; always excellent.\\n\\nI still recommend this restaurant for a date night without the kids but can no longer, in good conscience, give Ray's a 5, or even 4-star rating. Ray, you've been downgraded to a 3. \\n\\nTake this review for what it's worth.

I have never found the food to be \\"typical American style Chinese food\\",  I've never been to China, but I've eaten in a lot of old school Chinese restaurants and Gold Garden is not your parents Chinese diner. Most of the dishes are completely foreign, I'm writing this from home so I can't give you great examples on the spot. I'm sure a person might find their favorite traditional dishes amongst the myriad of mystery taste thrills. The menu doesn't give many clues about the preparation, etc., you might do a quick search on your phone. Lastly, you are in a Chinese restaurant run by Chinese people, there are language barriers, cultural differences, and palate preferences that make it an experience as well as a meal. \\nLet's talk specifics: Egg Flower Soup, good flavor, odd yellow color, thick texture (guard gum), not my style, I wouldn't reorder. I'd give it **, General Tao's Chicken, veggies crisp and plenty, chicken okay, overall tasty. ***, Dry Fried Beans,  fresh string beans, bit overcooked, I asked if they were garlic beans, told yes, not as much as I was hoping for, lots of onion and peppers. ***, Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp, crunchy exterior perfectly cooked shrimp, light on the honey walnuts (maybe 5) plenty of perfectly cooked broccoli, mayo sauce was perfect.**** Service was ****.

It could easily feed four people, and is more than enough for two.\\n\\nThe steak was perfect. We ordered medium and the beef has just the right amount of pink. I'm not exaggerating, it was easily among the best steak I've eaten. The chicken and ribs were a bit dry, but still well seasoned and tasty. The mushrooms are full, small button shrooms and were not seasoned at all, which kind of surprised me. It would have been a nice touch.\\n\\nFor sides we had baked potatoes served with ample butter and sour cream. The side salad was above average. I had the chicken pot pie soup, which was like eating chicken pot pie without the crust. Very tasty and  an interesting \\"soup.\\"\\n\\nThe atmosphere is what you would expect.

The mismatched tables and chairs give the place character and set the mood for a unique experience.\\nThe food - we wet for dining month and the prix fix menu was a tour in flavor.  The chef has found a way to make the food accessible and seemingly simple, but extremely complex and multiple layers of flavor in one bite.  The lamb belly char siu was my first time having lamb belly.  Watch out pork belly, this is the next big thing.  Perfectly seasoned and charred w/ fat nicely rendered.  The smoked lamb Bobotie was by far the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I have no idea how she does it, but each portion felt like it was made to order for each plate.

The dessert is AMAZING! The milkshake I ordered was ginormous and filling and oh-so-tasty. It's totally okay to come here only for dessert. \\n\\nBad experience: We had a party of 15 people for my friend's birthday dinner. I ate dinner elsewhere in CityWalk due to the 2 hour wait to be sat since there they don't do reservations (this makes no sense by the way - too many people at all times! CityWalk - do better for your guests that have been at parks the whole day). When it was finally time to be seated, myself and a few others decided to only order desserts since we already ate. When we ordered, the waitress gave us a funny look and said \\"Dessert for dinner? Okay then...\\" in a non-jokingly matter, it seemed very judgmental. She was most likely disappointed we didn't rack our tabs up with all dinner orders so she could make the most money. A long time passed before people's dinner orders started to show up - without the desserts myself and the others ordered! Another dinner order also came out incorrect and had to be sent back. The waitress stated an excuse about the kitchen being very busy, but as a former server that worked in restaurants for years to get myself through college, I know for a fact desserts take way less time to make than dinner does. The waitress most likely forgot to put our orders in. The ones who ordered dinner were almost done with their plates before we decided to just cancel our dessert orders. After we cancelled the dessert, they all of a sudden came out (the waitress probably didn't want to lose any more tabs on the bill). One member of our party had to turn the dessert away after she was too mad about waiting so long for it to come out and I didn't blame her one bit. I only accepted mine because I really wanted to try the giant milkshake and it didn't disappoint. The waitress also was not very attentive and came back sporadically. On top of this hot mess, the waitress automatically added a 18% gratuity to the bill, which I understand is usual for large parties, but in this case, it was inappropriate for the service that we received. If the server couldn't handle the big party or was too new/inexperienced, I wish she asked for some assistance from management or another server instead of just trying to milk as much tip money as she could from our table. This kind of experience is inappropriate for a birthday party - we all told the birthday girl we hope she never makes us come back to this place as a large party again, and she was peeved this happened on her birthday.  \\n\\nI don't want to judge this beautiful new restaurant from one experience from a bad server, and also know that CityWalk gives great customer service and does all that they can to make situations like this one right, which is why this is not a one-star review. Maybe they are still working out the kinks and need to give their servers a little bit more training."},{"name":"Crush","address":"1400 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Popped in for a drink before dinner and feel in love with the place.

I chose this place because I saw they had a reuben and I am all about a good reuben.  Sadly, the reuben here did not deliver. It was OK, but for being a deli-style restaurant, it was definitely lacking. Firstly, there was barely any meat. They do have an NYC option for the reuben, but the regular reuben is listed at 5oz of meat (which in my experience is usually plenty, but did not seem like the amount I got on my visit) and for $12.75 there should have been more heft than the skinny sad little reuben that I was served. What meat there was was good, but because there was so little, the dressing overpowered it and it just was not what I was looking to satisfy my craving. I got the spicy version, which was flavorful, but again, there was not enough to really enjoy. The red potato salad that came with was also a bit dry and bland.  Maybe it was because we came a little before closing? Not sure. I probably should have gone w/the slaw.\\n\\nFor $16 w/tax, tip, and drink, I have to say it was a bit overpriced.

It was pretty loud, and the tables are closer together than I prefer. Not a huge deal, but if you're looking for a romantic and intimate dinner date, this probably isn't your spot. However, the food was incredible and employees were very attentive.\\nDrinks :\\nSuffering Bastard - WOW what a strong drink. Although, it's expected, considering its claim to navy strength rum. Wasn't particularly a fan because alcohol was ALL you could taste, but I'm not partial to the strong alcohol taste in any case.\\nRose of Lima - This was a much more delicate drink. If you're looking for something a bit more unique, then this is a good choice, as it has a floral component. Very tasty!\\nFood : \\nSweet Potato Chips with Scallion and Meat Jus Dip - a nice way to start off with drinks. The chips themselves were very good! Although, the dip tasted like an ordinary French onion dip.\\nPad Thai with Scallops and Bacon - to be honest I expected a bit more from this dish. Pad Thai is a favorite of mine, and I've always thought that anything you add bacon to was a gift to earth. The flavoring of typical Pad Thai wasn't really evident. The bacon was thick cut, and although it was good, it wasn't necessarily a great supplement. The scallops were great in their own regard, but again, I'm not sure about their role in the dish as a whole.\\nPo' Boy - This was a special. Soft Shell Crab with what seemed like a coleslaw topping in a sandwich. The crab was delicious with a crunchy coating. The flavors of whatever was in the sandwich were interesting in their own regards, but I thought they went very well together.\\nCarolina BBQ Potstickers - wonderful crispy goodness of a perfectly fried potsticker FILLED with fantastic pulled pork! Um, yum? And if that's not enough, there was a spicy sauce underneath that added a great kick to the dish. \\nBison Mini Burgers - just get it. Best burger in itself that I've ever had. The burger alone was SO tasty, cooked PERFECTLY. It also came with a sauce which was a great addition. This was by far the most satisfying part of the meal!\\n\\nOverall, this is my favorite fusion restaurant thus far. The ideas were very fun, and for the most part executed well!

I first visited for my birthday in 2005 and fell in love with them. They weren't crowded, the food was amazing, prices were reasonable, portions were good, and best of all, you get to take home the menu, which was printed daily and dated (perfect souvenir for a birthday dinner).\\n\\nWell, just like anything good, word got out and they started getting busy (I know because I live on that street and pass by almost every day). Seeing a good business get the popularity they deserve is awesome, but at the same time, it's kind of sad because you just know things won't stay the same for long.\\n\\nSure enough, in 2007, they underwent some major renovations. And when they reopened, the parking lot was packed every single day. My boyfriend and I were just as curious as everyone else to see what changes took place but we decided to wait until the newness wore off a bit so we didn't have to make a reservation forever in advance. When we finally made it back, we saw that the changes they had made to the decor was beeeautiful AND obviously expensive (e.g., carpeted steps were now made of marble). They had converted a dressy-casual restaurant to a place where floor-length ballgowns (think prom) wouldn't seem out of place. Prices went up, portions got smaller, and mood lighting got much darker (probably so you can't see the prices). Food quality also seemed to decrease, or maybe that was just a side effect of having to pay $30 for 3 scallops. The service we had that time was terrible too, but I wrote it off as them having a newly hired staff. Lastly, the menus were now leather-bound, so no more souvenirs.\\n\\nA little over a week ago, I celebrated my birthday again here for old time's sake. The food is back to being good but still very overpriced, service seems less personal than ever, and the overall experience just has no wow-factor anymore. After numerous chances (this was probably my 6th visit to the restaurant, 3rd since its renovation), I think I'm going to finally accept that Ray's will never be as it was pre-2007. I might come back one more time to try the brunch that everyone talks about but no more dinners here for me.

The taste for bulgogi was mediocre, but, while charging $16.95, the portion was about 60% of the same dish offered by most of the Korean restaurants in Allston area.  The taste for soondubu jjigae was simply and plainly wrong.  While the dish was not disgusting, I really don't know what it is that they brought, but it is not soondubu jjigae.  And the portion is on the smaller side for $13.95.  \\n\\nThe common small dishes (banchan) they offered were small in portion and low in quality.  It is quite obvious from their taste that these were most likely bought in a grocery store like Super 88 and had been hanging in their fridge for a while.   They also served us 3 banchan to start until we requested for more.\\n\\nWaitresses were all good nature and easy to talk to, but that does not compensate for their poor service.

We had been to this location prior when it housed a Chinese restaurant. From when you walk in, they have an incredible bar and lounge area for a pre-dinner cocktail or opportunity to collect as your party arrives. We had reservations and were seated immediately. The restaurant was packed! The clientele for a Saturday night was mostly older people, but my husband and I were discussing how Dunwoody consists of young families and empty nesters and the young parent's hardly go out and if they do, they wouldn't bring young children to this restaurant. Although the restaurant has a kid's menu, I wouldn't bring my toddler and infant to this place at 7:30 PM on a Saturday night. They had an extensive wine list, lots of delicious menu options and nice specials. We started with a glass of house wine and bruschetta. The bruschetta was what you would expect - nothing too unique, but very good. We then split the Tomato Bisque soup which was excellent. Definitely rich and creamy. They served a house bread and it was perfectly crusty and soft - a great dipper for the soup. I had the cesar salad and my husband had a mixed green salad - both average and what you would expect. My husband had the pasta dish with the grilled chicken and garlic. His pasta was perfectly cooked - al dente and the dish was delicious! I had Halibut and it tasted a little over cooked, but the sauce they drizzled over it and the lemon risotto it sat on was exceptionally yummy. Our waiter overheard me say this was our first time at the restaurant, and he surprised us with the house made Tiramisu on the house. It was delicious. The service was great and it was a nice dinner. It is very pricy for the fact that most of the items we ordered were average, but it wasn't overpriced, just average from what you would expect of a restaurant of this stature. We would probably go back if the occasion called for it or if we had guests in town and wanted to stay close to the house. I recommend you try it out. For $90 you get 2 glasses of wine, 1 appetizer, 1 soup, 2 salads and 2 entrees (of which the soup and entrees were incredible while the others were average)."},{"name":"Cha Cha Cha Mexican Taqueria And Bar","address":"3808 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"After failing to watch a sabering (you can't call it \\"sabering\\" when you use some kind of machete, monsoor froggy) and munching some macaroons (okay, that's *three* good things about France) I was hungry.

I would definitely stick with their sashimi since I thought it was the best thing they had. We managed to get their udon noodles on our first visit as well which was also really good. Light and not a bad appetizer to prep you for your sushi feast.\\n\\nOn our second visit, we ordered the love boat once again and their spicy salmon sashimi. Their spicy salmon sashimi was BOMB. I loved it so if you ever get a chance, I would highly recommend it. They gave us free salad, miso soup, and an Alaskan roll because they messed up our order so we got to try those out as well. Once again, it was a pretty satisfying experience.\\n\\nAs for service, they're pretty good. However, on our second visit, they completely missed our order so they gave us some free food. Wished they didn't forget about us in the first place but they quickly apologized and provided us with ample food to fix the problem; can't complain about free food! Besides, it's understandable since the restaurant is pretty busy all the time.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is clean and cozy. There's always a lot of people so keep in mind that you might have to wait a bit when you come in. Other wise, not a bad place to dine on some sushi.\\n\\nMy overall rating: 3.7\\nFood: 4\\nService: 4\\nLocation: 3"},{"name":"Tacos Mazatlan","address":"","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by for quick taco lunch. 5 tacos served up SUPER FAST, like 5 mins or less!

So I decided to go ethnic and try out the highly-rated Greek Corner.\\n\\nThe atmosphere alone gets this place 5 stars. The inside seemed OK enough, but the patio was heaven: blue and white hanging bulbs, columns draped in bougainvilleas, Greek music playing softly and lights twinkling from Lake Ivanhoe and the shops across Orange Ave. Full disclosure, your view of the lake is interrupted by the parking lot, and you can expect some traffic noise from Orange. However, the overall effect was so charming that I really couldn't hold that against the place.\\n\\nThough the menu offered an extensive selection of Greek specialties, such as lamb and chicken cooked various ways, stuck to my \\"simple, vegetarian\\" goals for the evening. I started with dolmathakia, herbed rice stuffed grape leaves. For you cheese-lusting vegans out there (I know your kind), this will be the methadone to your dairy withdrawal: the tangy flavor and crumbly texture of the rice filling caused me to actually call over the waiter to check that it didn't contain feta. Nope, entirely vegan. Next up was a vegetarian souvlaki: grilled eggplant, red peppers, zucchini and feta on a warm pita. The vegetables were perfectly prepared--surprisingly crisp, yet hot all the way through. The side greek salad was about what I expected, however, diced bell pepper and cucumber livened it up.\\n\\nAll in all, the place has a wonderfully humble vibe: plastic water glasses, paper napkins, laminated menus and friendly servers.

The sea trout was cooked very well but also lacked flavor along with the shrimp. I would say all of the platter was very well done and it just had no flavor. Although the oysters on the half shell were very good you must remember to request the horseradish and cocktail sauce.

First I downloaded their app, but couldn't create a profile in order to register for their rewards program, so I just ordered as a guest through the app. I walked over to pick up my order and from the moment I walked in is where they really failed, in my opinion. The place was pretty much empty, aside from the folks that worked there, but it took a bit for anyone to acknowledge my presence. The face man for the place looks at me and says \\"can I help you\\"? Pfffff.... I told him I was there to pick up an online order. He handed me the pizza and I asked him if there were already peppers and cheese in the box. He says \\"yeah, I can get those\\". Cool.... He practically tosses them into my hand, dropping some in the process. I asked him about the problems I had creating an account on their app and if there was another way to register. He says, \\"we don't really know\\". Okaaay... The guy just didn't have any people skills, again in my opinion. The pizza was average.

My family, a few friends and I decided we were going to eat at Rays on the River for Thanksgiving this year. I've never eaten at any Rays establishment before and have heard really good things about Rays on the River. After looking at their extensive Thanksgiving menu online, I was impressed so I proceeded to book the reservation. Because we were a party of 9, I was told by the staff that we would be seated in their \\"Pavilion\\" to accommodate larger parties. They said it was an outdoor, temperature controlled area that they hold wedding parties or special events in. Didn't seem like a problem to me over the phone so I booked the reservation. I was emailed their reservation form which required a credit card hold and it stated that their would be a 21% gratuity charge. Ok, no problem. Thanksgiving evening approaches and we arrive at the restaurant. It seemed pretty congested pulling in and waited a bit for valet. There was a massive amount of people standing outside waiting for their reservation or vehicle from valet. We approached the desk outside to let them know our party had arrived and we didn't wait very long as we were called pretty close to our reservation time. What I didn't care for was my party and I were escorted outside around to the back through the back parking lot, weaving through parked cars to arrive at a tent which was their \\"Pavilion.\\" Hmm, ok. We were seated at a table meant to seat 8 comfortably and being a party of 9 adults, we had very little elbow room. Also, the temperature of the tent was quite chilly as well since our reservation was for late in the evening after temps went down a bit from the beautiful afternoon we had. We were greeted by our waiter who was courteous and did a good job of keeping our water glasses filled. The restaurant appeared crammed as it was packed with people inside. Given it was a holiday, it was understandable but weaving around tables and accidentally bumping into people seated due to little space to get to the indoor buffet was not fun. The food was really the biggest disappointment. It is buffet style, serve yourself, which I like and although there was a vast assortment of food displayed both inside the tent and inside the restaurant that we were able to choose from, a good portion of the food items were barely above room temperature and the quality of food was poor. The food items were more of a pre-cooked, frozen food quality than a fresh, \\"home cooked\\" type of meal. I have eaten at other great Atlanta restaurants for holidays and was disappointed with this establishment. Myself and my party were not impressed but remained upbeat and enjoyed each other's company and the holiday. We received our $600 bill tally for the evening which included $96 in gratuity charges and concluded our evening. Because I have never eaten at Rays during their normal business hours outside of this holiday, I don't have anything to compare to as far as food quality and standards but after seeing the massive amount of people they are trying to serve and being served this poorer quality of food at this important holiday time left me with a bad impression that they are more concerned with turning a profit than maintaining high standards for their food.

The atmosphere is outstanding and the drinks are tremendous.   It was a recent visit that started to expose their growing pains and it's not good.   They have added a restaurant and it feels like they don't know what they are doing.\\n\\nThe main building where they serve drinks has a ton of character.   But it's not updated to reflect the change in food service.  They still have a line labeled Drinks &. Food, yet after waiting in said line for 10 minutes we are told you can't order food up there anymore.   Get rid of the sign!  And how about removing the large chalkboard that has been there forever that details the day's cheese and charcuterie plates?  Maybe a sign that says all food should be ordered at the restaurant?  Instead they say hot food can be ordered at the restaurant.  These are simple changes that make the experience better.  \\n\\nNow on to the new restaurant.   I have no idea what the theme here is.   There is no character at all, which is a shame since the overall character of Treaty Oak is great.  There is a giant TV that seems pretty out of place.  It's counter service in which you have to search for a menu.  And the service is slooooooow.    I waited 20 plus minutes for a plate of burnt ends.   This place could be so much better, but it feels like they cheaped out.  It almost feels like a mall food court.  \\n\\nThere is some serious fine tuning needed here.  \\n\\nWe will continue to visit and enjoy the great drinks, but I think we're done with the food for now."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We accidentally lost the freedom trail and wandered into Mike's Pastry for a snack.

We arrived the first time around 6 and learned better. The second time we arrive around 7:30 and the weather was perfect. No seating unless you buy VIP, but the vip packages didn't include anything but a seat and a waiter so it didn't seem worth it. Eli was less crowded, but Randy's concert was packed! Just depends on which concert you go to when it comes to the crowd. Since I've heard this location has been sold and they will be building a new venue, I seriously hope they will organize the bars better.

The food was deplorable. No meat on any of the bones on the ribs plate, the brisket was full of fat and not much else, it was like eating fat and bones covered in mediocre sauce. I shudder just recalling the food here, honestly. The only thing we ordered that was edible was the wedge salad, thank god they didn't find a way to screw that up. \\n\\nThe drink I was brought was not the drink I ordered and the waitress argued with me about it at length. They apparently ran out of strawberries and she claimed the color in the campari had separated and that's why the beverage was the wrong color. However, she didn't admit this until I sat there puzzled reviewing the cocktail menu to be sure I didn't order wrong. How about a heads up when you bring me the wrong drink, sugar?  when I FINALLY got her to admit it was wrong and to take the drink back, she came back saying, \\"i was able to get the kitchen to give us some strawberries and we opened a new bottle of campari for you, this should do it.\\" Oh I'm so honored...? What the hell?\\n\\nThe live music was cool though, very good, and helped me get over the rude wait staff. They were all pretty snotty.

I like the fact that they make their own pork dumplings and various shrimp, fish, pork, b eef balls. Cod fish was very fresh as were their rolled meats like lamb and beef. Side table where you self serve to mix your own sauces like soy sauce, satay sauce, chili oil, peanut sauce, vinegar etc. The sides were so so. The kimchi was their version of huge chunks of cabbage, fairly sour not spicy. Gogii lychee dessert was quite small in size.  Soup base boils quickly and evaporates quickly so instead of needing to constantly flag down servers to refill, we turned the temperature up and down as needed in order to conserve the soup base. There are combos you can choose from which are often better deals bc soup base is included, soup base alone is 9.99.\\n\\nService: seems to be plenty of staff around on both occasions we were there but they are not attentive. You need to flag them down and they are quite cold like you are annoying or bothering them.  I go for the food and try to ignore the service part.

I went with a group with a corporate account paying for it, so we tried a LOT of the menu items.  As to be expected, some were awesome and some were meh.  I'll try to outline the full experience as well as I can.\\n\\nWe started with:\\nCalari - HUGE bowl of fried calamari.  Seasoning was well spiced and you didn't always need the sauce accompaniment, but it was good too.\\nCaprese Salad - Really good.  Nice salty mozz paired with sweet/tangy tomatoes.  Really just the classic caprese dong well.\\nPansoti de Zucca - little butternut squash purses surrounded by brown butter.  YES PLEASE.  These could have easily been dessert.\\nThe apps rocked it.\\n\\nI had the prosciutto wrapped shrimp for my entree.  I think I had the more enjoyed entree out of our group.  The prosciutto was done well but the shrimp were maybe a bit over.  The haricot verts (green beans) were tasty.  The supli (I had known them previously as arancini) were friend rice balls.  They were good but needed the red chili pesto to add some flavor.\\n\\nWe tried many of the desserts:\\nNeapolitan - Chocolate Donut was really good.  Not super sweet but rich chocolate flavor.  Vanilla gelato.  Tasty.  Sweet and creamy.  Strawberry jam.  Weird.  No thanks.\\nStawberry Sorbetto - the bomb.  so so good.  great flavor and sweetness.  the shortbread cookie that came with it was forgettable.\\nCheesecake - nice, dense, not too sweet.  raspberry sorbetto was awesome.\\nCreme Brulee - forgettable.  not terrible but nothing special.  This one I actually wanted/needed to be a bit sweeter.\\n\\nOur server took pretty good care of us.  We had a leisurely dinner (3 hours) but by the time we were ready to go we had a hard time catching his attention.\\n\\nThere are definitely some great things at Vespaio.

And mikes pastry does not disappoint. \\n\\nThe line outside to get in speaks for itself. Typically when you walk to a nightclub and you see a herd of people outside the door trying to get in, you're naturally going to assume its because whatever is going on inside has to be mind blowing.  Well, mikes pastry is the equivalent to that.\\n\\nIt cant be normal to spend $55.00 at a bakery can it? Also, should you be embarrassed when the guy behind the counter giggles every time you add another thing to your white pastry box, thinking you're finally done raping this place of every canoli, lobster tail, and chocolate creme brulee they have. But no, you just keep adding more to the box, and he just keeps on giggling wondering how someone so tiny plans on consuming so much pastry.\\n\\nI love their traditional take on a bakery. youll find eclairs and cream puffs, canolis and cookies. None of that overly modern stuff you'd find in some 5 star steakhouse.\\n\\nThe only reason i docked the star is because being an out of town-er, visiting mikes for the first time, I was very confused on how to get in and how to order. There are too many people inside and absolutely no order to the madness. There are no lines, just people squished together like sardines doing their best to communicate to their friend on the other side of the shop, \\"heeyyyy! See anything good in that case!?\\" you cringe at the thought of you not seeing every single item they have to offer. Did i just miss out on the best pastry of my life? Then the lady next to you snarls as she clearly doesn't appreciate you screaming in her ear. But.you have no choice. \\nFight your way to any associate and just start screaming out the pastries you want to take home, they are quick about it. but  you better memorize what you want, because there is no walking from case to case contemplating what you want. and be sure to have that cash money in hand, as they don't even deal with credit or debit.\\n\\nOh, oh but the sweet joy you feel walking out of the place with your very own box. Gripping around its corners with force, so that the only way someone was getting their hands on it was if they pryed it from your dead lifeless fingers.\\n\\nThen as you make it away from the crowd and youre safely across the street, looking at mikes from a distance like a mirage, youre finally clear to lean against a wall, slide your back down to the floor, and open up a treat worth lugging on as your second carry-on in the airplane leading you back home to san diego."},{"name":"Moe's Southwest Grill","address":"2484 Briarcliff Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this Moe's!

This created somewhat of a mushy texture and wasn't the best roll I've ever had but at the same time, I've had much worse.  \\n\\nFor dinner, we had the sea bass and Ahi tuna.  The sea bass was very good but the marinade was a bit much by the time you got to the end of the meal.  The Ahi tuna was great with a  great spicy sauce however the sous chef in the back must of used a 2 cup ladle because the steak would have been swimming in the sauce had I not built a damn on  1/2 my plate to prevent drowning my steak.   The manager said they have a new guy back there and he'd talk to the chef but agreed that there was way too much sauce on my plate.  \\n\\nNow, as far as the service, I've read where some reviewers have not had the best experience there and I have to tell you, I gave it 4 stars because the service was amazing.

No big deal, and the younger waiter was on the ball as usual and alerted him of my lack of coffee without even having to come to our table about it. He obviously overheard me talking about it to my family.\\n\\nThen there was a condescending comment the older \\"gent\\" said to my elderly aunt, who's meal was a couple of eggs with hash browns and one piece of toast. Nothing substantial and in fact seemed lacking as she would have liked a bit more toast for her eggs, understandably, but she did not complain. \\n\\nOnce we were finished our meals, he looked at her and said \\"You ate it all!\\" to which she seemed taken aback and said \\"well yeah, I was hungry\\". \\n\\nCue my sympathy for my aunt and utter disgust at the waiter for this passive aggressive comment that one could only surmise was a quip about her weight. \\n\\nI don't know if this guy is the owner or manager and I don't like to cause problems when I have family that are regulars there including myself, but it does not matter, that was absolutely uncalled for and rude.

We sat down and had already checked off things off the menu we wanted to order so we got our food very quickly. Our table was also right in front of the sushi/fish bar so all of the sushi/rolls/sashimi we ordered were immediately hand delivered right in front of us! They indicate on their menu that they will charge you extra if you waste food, so do NOT order more than you think you will eat! When you mark a quantity on the menu, that's what it literally means. If you mark 1 next to a sushi roll, you will only get 1 PIECE of sushi - not 1 big roll. If you mark 1 next to gyoza, you will only get 1 piece of gyoza. ...you get the picture. :) The food was overall very delicious and the waiters are very quick to give you your food and hand you extra menus in case you want to order anything else. The wait was definitely worth it! The next time we go to Vancouver we will go out of our way to come here for dinner again. :)"},{"name":"Green Lettuce Indian Style Chinese Restaurant","address":"1949 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is the best Indian Chinese food we ve had in Vancouver. 4 of us ordered the Gobhi Manchurian, Fried Rice, Chilli Paneer, Shezhuan noodles and Manchow soup.

Just go ahead and dip that lobster and crab in butter, you bad boy.\\n\\n2) Don't forget that you can order certain items like hushpuppies and lobster bisque from the waitress.  \\n\\n3) Don't eat too many calorie-laden and stomach space consuming sides and salads.  Stick to eating lobsters, crab legs, prime rib, and other similar items.  Sides are only necessary if you want some variety.\\n\\n4) Desserts aren't great.  Just have more lobster and crab legs as dessert.\\n\\n5) This isn't a New England lobster house.  You're not going to get perfectly cooked lobster.  The lobster may be overcooked and a little rubbery, but it's all you can eat.\\n\\n6) There are coupons and deals floating around the web.  And eat before 6 PM, it's cheaper.\\n\\nI'm just glad I didn't have a doctor's appointment afterwards or he might not believe how high my cholesterol is.

I had ordered a few trays of food and it was supposed to be served at 7:45, but they didn't start bringing it out until after 9pm.  The bridal party (including myself) didn't arrive until 9:15, so maybe that was the source of confusion.  Our server was awesome, unfortunately I didn't catch her name.  I didn't have to go to the bar all night.  Mixed drinks and shots, some girls had beer.  Everything was great.  It was packed with people when we arrived at 9:15, then there was a lull around 10:00, and then it was packed again around 11:00 pm.  Good music, good crowd on the young side (early-mid 20s).

We had to talk ourselves out of ordering just 3 burgers the other day so we'd look like we have some breadth.\\n\\nI think that Porter Cafe has a tiny bit of a limited menu, but they knock those out of the park.

You may notice that the price is slightly lower than surrounding hotels, but not enough to make up for the mildew growing in the bathrooms, the awful food, or the front desk staff that seem to not care too much about their jobs.

But this is different. \\n \\nThe hotel needs an upgrade, for sure, but that's not important.  What is important is the fact that the bathroom in my room literally smelled and looked like the bathroom I shared with four guys back in college.

I was greeted by a friendly hostess who told me that I could place an order for takeout at the bar. I went to the bar and sat down. I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped me pick a proper meal. I told him I was feeding two people to keep that in mind. We started out with some type of saut√©ed cauliflower about $10. We on to his personable favorite. Brisket fried rice. About $16. Last but not least the entr√©e. Beef & pineapples. I enjoyed a glass of the house red while my order was being prepared. Meanwhile he brings my check. Including a $5 tip, $60. Let me repeat, $60. I get the food home and start opening containers. The rice was a mess. It was in fact brisket and rice. Then the cauliflower. There was four to five small sections covering the bottom of two separate very small bowls. It looked and tasted like cauliflower that had been cooked in soy sauce that you can find on any Chinese buffet. Around $10. Finally the Pineapple Beef!  Nowhere to be found. Let out of bag.

A bit too quick, but better fast than slow. The menu is difficult in that it is limited. One burger, one chicken sandwich, trout, ribeye and a pasta and a few salads. They have charcuterie and cheese biscuits. We ordered both, and while very good, the charcuterie came with 4 small crustinies, not enough to share or to finish the plate. Biscuits were good, but not as soft and fluffy as on a previous visit. Now to the reason I am writing this review. Prices! Sandwiches don't come with a side. 14$ for the sandwich, 5$ for a side, now you are paying  $21 for a hamburger! While it was good, there are many better to be had that come with fries. Think the pearl or the Top steakhouse. Same for the chicken sandwich. Nothing comes with sides. We ordered the ribeye, for 36$, and it came all alone on a plate. Not even a sprig of parsley!

As such, dinner reservations need to be booked well in advance even during off seasons, but if you have a small party you MIGHT be able to get like a 3:00 booking 2 days in advance if you call the reservations number (which I tend to find a more successful strategy than the website or app especially for traveling alone or in pairs). It has low ceilings and the customers seem to keep quieter than in some of the other places so that you can have a quiet conversation. I eat my steaks rare to 'gently mooing' a temperature that will betray a cheap cut of meat no matter how well marinated, and cause gristle to overshadow all. While I have been underwhelmed with the cuts of meat I have had at other disney locations this one was good -- although the chef at first sent out a cut that was medium rare and therefore by my tastes overlooked. Happily the staff whisked it away and brought its replacement so quickly that there must have been a backup waiting. My only complaint is that the marinade for the steak sort of overpowered the meat (when a $50 steak should really be the star). It came on a mushroom risotto that nicely complemented the marinade. I also has the classic pontine which was very tasty and went well with the steak. For dessert I got the maple cream br√ªl√©e, and whoever had put the crust on had been over enthusiastic. Rather than a light crust that crumbled under your touch I had to really crack it open and the taste of burnt sugar was all I could taste."},{"name":"Long John Silver's","address":"704 E Williams Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This was a rare treat for me because I like LJS but  there isn't one where I live.

I went here with 2 girlfriend to celebrate my birthday and one of my girlfriends. We went on a Sunday afternoon thinking that is would not be to bad of a wait. We still have an one wait at 3:00 on a Sunday. We walked around the inside store and then did a lap around city walk until my friend got a text that our table was ready. We were sat upstairs stairs right by the window and had an incredible view. We noticed there was a bar area up there and asked about the wait sitting there. Our waiter mentioned that, that area is a walk up with no waiting. Good thing to keep in mind for the next time. One of my girlfriends is gluten free so she asked the waiter some questions about what she could order since they do not have a separate menu. He went as far as to bring out the chef for the day who, explained everything in detail to her that she could order. Since she chose the kettle chips, he explained he would even change the oil in the fryer for her accommodation. Amazing customer service. We all ordered milkshakes and shared the kettle chips. They do have two separate kitchens and our order of milkshakes came out first and then the chips. I got the bacon shake with bacon ice cream, bacon brittle, chocolate covered bacon and bacon whipped cream. I do not need to have bacon for the next month as I had my fill in this one drink. Was life changing if you like bacon. One of my girlfriends had chocolate times 5 and the other had peanut butter indulgence. All were very tasty. We also ordered a cream brulee to go. Our waiter washed out our milkshake cups for us so we can taken them with. I would for sure get the kettle chips again as they were both crunchy and soft in places and had the perfect amount of melted cheese and red and green banana peppers on top. Nicely decorated quite large and loud. Very busy. If you are only have a milkshake there is a counter where you can order just that and take it to go. I would go again and try more food items.

I totally get why people love this place and would travel near and far to come to it. The food is outstanding! Lucky for us we live in Waltham, unfortunate for our budgets we can only enjoy it on special occasions. \\n\\nI thought their restaurant week special of 4 courses for $25 pp was a special occasion. Don't you just love a foodie bargain? The regular entrees are in the $16-$23 range which isn't bad.

At Bombay Caf√©, you'll find the locals- either taking a respite after some grocery shopping, or just in for a quick, cheap Indian bite.\\n\\nLook, this is not a fine dining concept. You have to take a menu upon entering, walk up to the front counter, order, take a numbered stanchion to an open table, and wait for your order to be dropped off. If you want to be served hand-and-foot, this place is NOT for you.I ordered a few dishes to sample a variety of their offerings- Pani-Puri ($3.95), Paneer Pakora Chaat ($5.99), Mysore Masala Dosa ($7.95), and the hard-to-find Gobi Paratha ($3.50). In retrospect, I'm glad I stopped from ordering more since it was more than enough food.\\n\\nFor standard Bombay-style cuisine, the Pani-puri was the right choice. 8 puris (small hollow, fried, crisp dough spheres) were presented with a sufficient amount of a garbanzo-potato mixture and a side bowl of sweet-and-spicy water. A triad of chutneys- mint-cilantro, tamarind, and a mildly spicy orange-colored one were promptly set beside the appetizer. I like assembly of this dish a lot- you have to deftly fill the water inside the hole of the puri and gobble the entire thing in one fell swoop. Yum. The garnish of Sev (thin fried lentil noodles) and cilantro was perfection.\\n\\nThe Paneer Pakoras were definitely a toss-up. Some people would prefer a thicker piece of Paneer in it. Others would be content with how spongy the batter was that soaked up the flavors surrounding it. But I did feel that this was consistent with a street food order- paneer, in India, especially if you're not in the North, can be a higher priced item. At Bombay Caf√©, their pakoras have a scant slice of paneer. About 4 large pakoras were quartered and topped with curried garbanzos, yogurt, tomatoes, and chopped onions. It was good. The side condiments are integral to this dish. So when you go, don't forget to add the chutneys. \\n\\nThe Mysore Masala Dosa was okay. The dosa (a sort of fermented lentil crepe) needed to be crisper- a simple technique of cooking it over the skillet for a slight longer would have scored higher on execution. The flavors were a little subdued- especially of the masala that was smeared onto the crepe. I have a feeling that this is the orange chutney that was part of the condiment triad. The turmeric-laced mashed potatoes, lentils, and green peas that were tucked inside the rolled-up crepe were standard. So was the accompanying side of Sambhar (curried vegetable stew) that you get to dip the crepe in. However, I found myself skipping over the crepe to get to these tastier items. \\n\\nThe Gobi Paratha was intriguing since I've never tried one. A little bland for my taste, I realized that gobi (cauliflower) doesn't have much flavor to begin with. The gobi inside this flat bread is minced ultra-fine with a touch of garlic and cilantro. A side order of Ghee (clarified butter) made the paratha more enjoyable. Next time, I will pair this with a main-course curry item.\\n\\nAfter lunch, I did have the opportunity to talk to the owner, Joy Kakkanad, who mentioned that they are known for their Indo-Chinese specialties. He also mentioned that his restaurant's main goal is to deliver speedy, minimal service with flavorful food and highly competitive price points. Mr. Kakkanad, I think you have a good concept and I think your flavors are successful in capturing the Bombay dine-and-dash scene.\\n\\nOh, and a word of caution- these are Bombay flavors. Hence, the name of the place. Not Delhi, Kolkata, or Chennai. I get perplexed at self-entitled people that request (like this particular 'special' man in front of me at the counter) \\"authentic Gujrati style\\" and the equally profane \\"make it medium-spicy but not too spicy.\\" I suppose the cook had to stop everything and have a little interview with him about exactly how much chilly would be perfect in return for a STAGGERING SUM OF $6 from his precious little wallet. GET REAL AND GET SOME ETTIQUETTE. If you don't like the food, just don't go back. You're making the person behind you (viz., me) look like I just stepped off the boat with you.\\n\\nIN A NUT SHELL: A great way of introducing your friends to Indian cuisine with a Bombay flare (which happens to be the second most-populous city in the WORLD). If they don't like it, you didn't bust your wallet over them. For 2 appetizers, 1 main course, and 1 bread, my bill came out to be $22 with tax. And they were big enough to be split between 2 people! And we couldn't finish all of it! The d√©cor is tastefully done but don't expect 5-star service. Do expect a good price point for what you're being offered."},{"name":"Bombay Caf√©","address":"1137 Doss Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing Indian food slightly more affordable than its major competitor - u must  order the chilli paneer and the paneer makhani.

My only true complaint, however, is the parking and traffic flow.

It is something I contemplate when going there- do I want to deal with the parking and driving out of there. I know Disney is working on this, but I don't think they should keep adding on to Disney Springs until this is fixed (new shopping planned).

The menu looks like an antique book and once you open it, you can read the story line behind the restaurant theme.  I am not a big eater by nature and I knew I wanted to try a dessert, so I ended up ordering the cream of broccoli soup, truffle fries and water to drink.  The water came out in an amazing etched glass, which I loved.  The soup was thick and creamy with a small slice of cheddar cheese and a broccoli stem on top.  The truffle fries were crunchy and very tasty.  For dessert, I ordered the hazelnut milkshake, which comes in a souvenir mason jar (not glass), which you can take home.  The milkshakes are about $12.00 and honestly I could not finish mine, so you are better off sharing with someone else.

Yes it was decadent and calorie laden with all the cheese, dough and crust but that was a simpler time when my doctor wasn't so adamant about such things as \\"cholesterol\\" and \\"weight\\" and I got that pizza on more than one occasion.\\n\\nHowever, recently, about 6 to 8 months ago I went over here and got the single serving deep dish pepperoni and it was truly abysmal.  No sauce hardly, and it was under the cheese, not how deep dish is supposed to be served.  Because deep dish has very thick crust it depends upon the extra sauce to make it yummy.  With not enough sauce the pizza was somehow both doughy and dry.  The cheese was ok but they were quite stingy with it.  I didn't even finish the pizza, it was just that poor.  And one look at my belly and you'd know I rarely leave pizza on the table!\\n\\nSince that experience I have eaten two more times here and tried other dishes and everything is pretty good.  The service can be a little slow but I'm always able to get back to work within an hour.

Apparently the restaurant opens at 4 pm for dinner but they have an outdoor stand that sells the tastiest burritos (vegetarian or pork) and you can get it with a side of scrumptious green or red chile. I was initially snobby, thinking how good could these burritos be if they're pre-made and sitting in a warmer, so initially was planning to watch my husband eat his burrito. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. After one bite, I needed a burrito for myself. These are definitely worth the calories. The burritos were moist and full of flavor. The tater tots add just the right amount of crunch. The veggies were so delicious on their own that it didn't need the delicious tasty braised pork, but it was a welcome addition. The green Chile was full of herbalicious flavor and just the right amount of heat. They also sell coffee and Mexican hot chocolate. Max was super friendly.

While Le Cellier is one of the pricier options, even worth two meal credits on the Disney Dining plan, having the dining plan makes Le Cellier very well worth it, and if you're not on the DDP and looking for a special dinner, this is your place.  Reservations are notoriously difficult to obtain, so use Disney's guide of 180 days in advance.\\n\\nWe had been salivating all day waiting for our dinner reservation, even to the point where I was begging to try to go in early.  I really liked that the restaurant is set back off of the \\"main drag\\" of World Showcase.  Beyond that, the ambiance is very woodsy-lodge-y, and I loved every minute of it!\\n\\nAs with all of World Showcase, our server was Canadian, and very proud of it.  It was also very evident that she *loved* working at Disney, and was happy to be helping us.  She made our experience at Le Cellier even that much better.\\n\\nEven though we were on the meal plan, we splurged a bit on some appetizers and beverages.  The menu for our evening at Le Cellier:\\n\\n:: Le Cellier Poutine - Canadian cheddar, black truffle, red wine reduction\\n:: Duck Confit Poutine  - which has since been replaced on the menu, but it had duck confit, berries, arugula and parmesan cheese.\\n\\nThis was my first foray into poutine, and it was incredible.  Literally, I wanted to lick the plate.  We could've eaten just poutine for dinner, but of course, we were on the meal plan and entitled to an entree and dessert.\\n\\nI had to go for the ribeye, as really, it's the meal plan.  I was on vacation, and I wasn't skimping.  This is a $64 ribeye.  I could've eaten it for three days, and shared with others.  The thing was massive.  But perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned.  Hands down, best Disney meal of the trip.  I'm dying to return."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've been waiting for what feels like 2 years for this place to open.  Then it opened and I had no idea for a month! So when I found out it was open, me and my buddy made a bee-line for breakfast and a few hours checking the place out and whacking some golf balls.\\n\\nFirst impression: Plenty of parking, though lot was quite full at 11am on a Sunday. Building is HUGE. Easiest way to get to it from International Dr. is to just cut through the convention center. It's right on the other side of it.\\n\\nWe walked in and it was indeed busy (we saw a few birthday parties, etc.) but we checked in in no time and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a bay (we specifically asked for a couch vs. high top as we planned to eat while we waited in the restaurant - so that added to our wait).  Well 10 minutes after we sat down and ordered or brunch drinks and food, they texted us a bay was ready.  The cool thing is the person on the other end of the text is a PERSON.  So we texted back \\"can we push it out 30 minutes while we eat?\\" and they responded back \\"sure thing\\" - and indeed about 30 minutes later they texted us the bay number that was held for us for 5 minutes as we were paying the check.  Just a cool system when it's not super busy.\\n\\nThe food was quite good (breakfast burrito and eggs benny) and other reviews seem to corroborate that they really do focus on the food quality. The bloody mary was really good as well as were the mimosas. \\n\\nWe hightailed it downstairs (the main floor is the 2nd floor; one above, one below).  Down there (ground level) is another full bar and more restaurant seating.  Our bay was 130 which was the furthest right besides the adjoining VIP area which is the same (like 4 bays I think), but in a private-ish room.  Our waitress explained how everything works, had a great personality, and kept us laughing and the frosty beverages coming!  I won't go into how the games work other than to say it's super easy to figure out and is kind of like a hybrid of bowling and golfing and darts.  It's awesome and lots of fun.\\n\\nWe chipped and drove our way through quite a few games in 2 hours before calling it quits. What's great is you can just extend your time if you want - everything is billed at the end. Genius on their behalf but it does get pricey quickly (especially if it's just 2 in a bay - they seat up to six for the same price). The bays are very comfortable, have a TV you can change, several screens to track the balls and scores, etc.  Pretty swank. Also this is the first location in the world to have realtime ball tracking. You hit the ball - it goes flying and can be hard to see where it lands. This fixes that - you get a literal video game style playback of your shot.  Awesome!\\n\\nWe can't wait to go back on a weekend night as I'm told the crowd is much more \\"nightlife\\" and our age group/DJ/etc.  But the wait for a bay often averages 3 hours the staff was telling us. Add it's prime pricing at $50/hr per bay - so we'll have to figure that out because 3 hours at the TopGolf bar(s) plus 2 hours in a bay could get VERY expensive and quite tipsy. I will update after I do a weekend night trip and figure that out.  Anyway you slice it (holla!) it's a really good time."},{"name":"Seito Sushi","address":"4898 New Broad St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This past Saturday without a reservation we popped into Seito Sushi  (Baldwin Park) to see if we could get a table (open table was full for the time we wanted).

We knew there was a likely going to be a ridiculous line, so we called ahead--hot, white for me and warm, white, double mac for him.  Mine translates to hot spice level and white meat chicken and his translates to warm heat level, white meat chicken, and double macaroni and cheese.  I actually like cole slaw, so I stuck with slaw and mac and cheese.  \\n\\nThis chicken is every bit as amazing as I had expected.  The chicken was so moist.  Mine was super spicy, almost overwhelming so, but I dipped into the free ranch dressing and that helped.  The cole slaw was vinegar based and I could tell by looking at it that it was peppered generously.  I really enjoyed it.  It provided a sweet and crunchy contrast to the spicy chicken and the rich, cheesy mac and cheese.  I was surprised at how good the mac and cheese was.  I am picky about it usually--so often mac and cheese is mushy and flavorless.  These noodles still had good texture and the cheese seemed real.  The plates came with pickles and white bread, but neither one of us ate any of that.  \\n\\nWe were planning to have dessert elsewhere so we passed on the banana pudding when ordering.  So it was a big surprise when there was a banana pudding in our bag! Score--free banana pudding!  It was banana flavored pudding, whipped cream, and a crumble of vanilla wafers in a little cup.  Really good even though neither one of us completely likes bananas.

Choose the light lunch. They'll seat you on a higher balcony. We didn't choose quickly enough so we were seated on Level 2 instead of Level 4, which is where the views are even more spectacular. I don't think the food would have been much different, or better. And the chairs on the top level, for some reason, are wicker instead of plastic. I guess the mimosas make up for the plastic, 2nd rate (but still amazing) view. \\nOkay, on the positive side....this is where I would have my rehearsal dinner, if I ever get married. NOT for the food. \\nAnd the gift shop is super cute with lots of unique gifts and \\"oh shit, I need to get something for so-and-so back home\\" kind of stuff.\\nDon't even get me started on the bizarre collection of sculptures outside. It's just an homage to the \\"Keep Austin Weird\\" philosophy we so inexplicably hold dear to our Texan hearts. Oops, apparently, it's not inexplicable.

Pretty tough to screw up a ham-and-egg-on-a-roll; I think Noah served those on the Ark. Three strikes and I never went back. But things have changed.\\n\\nThe new Ken's is very different. It's brand new, clean, neat and well-lit. The menu is on a signboard big enough for even those of us over thirty to be able to read. The personnel have a good, cheery attitude and the sandwiches are very good - as good as can be expected in a small town. They handle lunch rush hour with efficiency and accuracy. The ambiance is much nicer. The old Ken's reminded me of the Men's Room at Grand Central; the new one is borderline elegant. I've been back several times and it's on my weekly visit list.

It's an upbeat, fun place to get drinks and try tons of unique mouthwatering dishes. I went with a few family members late at night last Monday after the long weekend. The place was definitely poppin' and busy. Since the restaurant was just opened by a chef who owns one of the best restaurants in Boston, we expected their to be a wait. We grabbed drinks at the bar and stood at a funky high top made out of a gorgeous extended piece of wood. Here you can order whatever you like while you wait for a table. Passing servers were attentive to us and asked if we'd like any appetizers while we drank our cocktails but we chose to wait to be seated before placing a food order. \\n\\nWe waited for about 45 minutes at which point we were given the option to sit at a traditional table and wait a few more minutes or be seated immediately at a communal high top. The word \\"communal\\" made me a little nervous but, after checking out the space, we chose the communal high top. As far as I'm concerned, we got the best seats in the house. The way the table was designed allowed ample space between us and the party to one side with a beautifully placed, hanging water feature on the wall to our other side. The table was in a corner at the far end of the restaurant so it offered us an intimate immediate space while still experiencing the lively, social features of the bar. \\n\\nOur server, Sarah, was one of the best servers we have ever had. She was sweet, knowledgeable (especially for having just opened), attentive and accommodating to our needs. I will definitely ask for her next time we go. \\n\\nThe dinner menu is fun and diverse. You can choose between small, medium and large plates which makes it really easy to share everything while enjoying drinks. Ming Tsai does a great job integrating Asian cuisine with traditional bar favorites making lots of options for various palates. We especially loved the Japanese sweet potato chips, pork and scallion wontons and the garlic-sake clams with udon noodles.\\n\\nWe will have to go back because there were a couple of dishes we wanted to try that they had run out of over the long weekend. Due to a high volume of guests along with adjusting management, these kinks along with waiting for a table is something that needs to be expected when dining at a recently opened, highly anticipated restaurant. It always takes at least a few weeks for a restaurant to run as efficiently as possible as it takes time for management to understand their rush patterns, clientele and levels of demand for particular dishes/drinks. I was amazed at the efficiency with which Blue Dragon was running having opened only a week earlier and am confident it will become one of the highest acclaimed restaurants in Boston. I highly recommend going here with a small group of friends to enjoy drinks and a night of tasting and sharing rounds of  delicious food."},{"name":"New York Pizza Exchange","address":"2810 Paces Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"\\"Pizza is a lot like sex.

Our table was ready when we got there, but we had to sit on the patio because we had a large party.  We had to read the menu with the flashlights on our phones as there was little to no light on the patio.  Not once did the waiter recognize we were there for a special occasion despite the bachelorette wearing a sash and the prior arrangements.  The food was good specialty BBQ but was not spectacular.  For the prices we paid, it should have been out of this world great with comfortable portions.  The best thing was the ribeye steak for over $40.  The salads were small and light on the dressing, the \\"family\\" style sides were only enough for a family of 2 at $8 each. We had to ask for drink refills. To top off the night, we got back to our cars to leave and the parking garage told us the validation was worthless after 5:00PM and parking would be $10.  We could have parked on the street for free!

I went here a few times as a freshman in college with friends - I never went out of my own peresonal choice but figured I would give the place a try. The pastries were worse than the pastries of the surrounding underrated North End bakeries like Bova's 24-hour bakery - Mike's Pastries taste very fake and um, Americanized. They don't have that genuine Italian/European flavor to them that the other bakeries have. But that is just half of the the review - what kills this place is the DISGUSTING and RUDE ATTITUDE of the people working there. It's ridiculous that they think they can get away with their behavior because they are overrated and all the tourists go there just to tote around a white box tied with ribbon. The first time I went there, I ordred take-out pastries and had them wrapped in that \\"signature white box.\\" I was with a couple of friends and after I paid (key word being \\"paid\\" - meaning I was a paying customer), I had to wait for my friends to place their orders. So I sat down at one of the tables there. Mind you, the place was pretty empty (it was a weekday afternoon), yet one of the busboys/waiters (whatever he was) came over to me and told me I could not sit there as I had take-out  and not eat-in. I was appalled. I wasn't going to eat my take-out there or anything - I just wanted to sit down for 2 seconds and wait for my friends. Ridiculous behavior. Another time a friend of mine told me she was trying to make a decision between some pastries and the clerk told her to \\"hurry the hell up as she didn't have all day.\\" Horrible behavior - these people are letting their overrated reputation go to their heads. I have given this place  a few shots and each time has been an unpleasant experience - if you want a true Italian pastry - hit up Bova's or even Modern Pastry (never been there but anything is better than Mike's at this rate!).

People kept going in ahead of me not even bothering to ask if I was on line, which I was. So being fed up with people essentially cutting in front of me, cause it's obvious that common courtesy goes out the door when you're here, I went inside and apologized to the person in front of me, saying I didn't want to squeeze in here but everyone kept coming in without asking if I was waiting so I had to. \\n\\nThere was only one reason I was there that night, to get a cannoli, or as I told the other people waiting on line behind me, I was there to get a cannoli to eat then I could go start drinking some beers, which ended up getting a few chuckles. The line somehow got really disorganized and snaked around the place, as it's not really the biggest to start with and there are a few tables with wait service against the wall, making it even more cramped than usual (the tables were all full when I was there). Slowly but surely, the line started moving and while I am not usually a sweets fan, some of the other pastries in the counters looked amazing too. Finally, I was able to put in my order for a cannoli (plain shell with ricotta filling) and when I finally got a chance to eat that cannoli, I knew the 30 minutes I waited in line for here was well worth the wait.\\n\\nThe things I didn't really like was I felt that there should and could have been a better way for the line to get organized. Another thing is, and this is actually really minor to me but it's a big deal for others is that they're cash only.

Instead, the dishes had depth and were true to what I have eaten overseas. The only reason I do not give this five stars is the soybeans. They cover some dishes in supposedly fried soybeans.

But I digress.\\n\\nMy colleagues and I ordered a few items, and had them boxed. They only accept cash, so one of us had to run over to the ATM a few blocks away. As we were leaving, one of the tables freed up, so we decided to sit down and eat there. One of my friends went up to the counter to ask them for some plastic spoons / forks. He came back and told us that they had refused because you \\"only get cutlery if you sit down and order\\". This sounded strange to me, so I went up to the counter and asked the first person I could find: \\"Is it true that I can only get spoons / forks if I sit down and order? A table just freed up so we decided to sit down, could we please get some plastic spoons?\\". She reaches under the table to give me the spoons when suddenly, the first server that my friend asked comes running in and says: \\"wait! Don't give them spoons. The other guy already asked me and I said no! They're trying to be sneaky!\\". \\n\\nThis assumption on her part really irritated me. First of all, I hadn't bothered to check if this server was the same one my friend had asked first. I just went up to the first person who was free. Second, why is trying to get a \\"plastic spoon\\" considered sneaky? It's not like I was asking for actual silverware, or that I'm trying to steal the crown jewels! Then comes the best part, she turns to me and says: \\"I don't know if you can read english, but there are signs everywhere that say you can only get spoons / forks if you sit down and order. I don't know why you had to go *aks* someone else for spoons when I already said no\\". \\n\\nYeeeeaaaah...... OK. The person who just said *aks* is asking me if I can read and understand English. Great. Maybe she assumed I couldn't speak English because of my skin color. The funny thing was, I was more upset about the fact that she thought I was being sneaky. I started arguing with her. Finally, we demand to see the manager, and I ask this so called manager why a simple request for forks and spoons (the plastic kind) is being treated with such hostility, at which point he shrugged his shoulders, and gave me some plastic spoons along with a bored look.
