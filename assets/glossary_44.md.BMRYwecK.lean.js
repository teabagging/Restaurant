I had the Mi-So-Hot (Tonkotsu-based) with chashu and menma (bamboo) while she had the Tonkotsu Original. Tatsu-ya's Tonkotsu broth is definitely the richest and most intense I've had outside of Japan. The broth in both of our bowls were thick with satisfying swirls of pork fat and a similar consistency as the soup used for dipping in Tsukemen. The egg was perfectly cooked with a runny yolk; the chasu was not too fatty; and the crunchiness of the woodear mushrooms was a nice touch. While I definitely liked the heat from the Mi-So-Hot, I'll most likely get the Tonkotsu Original next time, so I can enjoy the Tonkotsu broth in its pure glory. One thing though, I did notice that they used very thin noodles for their ramen. I'm used to thicker, wavy noodles in my ramen, but it ultimately  did not detract from the overall experience.\\n\\nBtw, I could feel my blood thicken from the pork fat as I was finishing the bowl.

My main point is that the food was great and trumped the service luckily. The waitress we had yesterday was ATROCIOUS. For a good majority of the meal she was rude, snappy and rushed and only I think realized how her behavior was unacceptable towards the end of the meal as she tried to make jokes and be cheerful at that point. However in my opinion, she had already lost me. I would definitely go back here for the food but if I ever got seated with her again I would immediately request a different table. We sat down and were told the waitress would come back when all of our party had arrived which was fine. However when she did return she was rude and unaccommodating when it came to placing our drink order. My sister in law had asked for a drink to be modified and after much complaining and I don't know oh I'll have to see and hemming and hawwing she said she would check. Once she brought the drinks around we were waiting to see if rolls would be brought to our table as we had seen all the other tables around us receive. We did eventually get those. My mother in law and I both ordered Sangria and when we received our drinks and took a sip we knew there was more than just wine in our drink so we asked the waitress what was in it. Her reply oh I don't know I know there's wine in it and started to walk away while my mother in law was trying to ask her if she could please ask the bartender what was in it. She said she would but we'd have to give her some time because she was really really busy. (Which would be fine under normal circumstances but her tone of voice throughout our meal was unacceptable to say the least). It didn't get any better than that because when she came back quite a few minutes later and we asked if she had inquired about the Sangria she told us no she had been to busy. It was at that point we had to explain to her that it tasted as though there was a liquor in the sangria and we would like to know if that was indeed the case. At that point she agreed to go right to the bar and find out for us which was great and all but since when do customers have to explain why they are asking a question about a menu item? The ordering of dinner was also very frustrating because of her attitude. She was very rushed in taking our order and was visibly displease when we asked any kind of question about a food item. Luckily our food for the most part came out correctly. When it initially came out, my sister in laws side of squash and my fiance's mashed potatoes hadn't come out and the waitress was very frustrated when I tried to explain that to her. Overall I'm very disappointed at our first visit here. I had suggested it to celebrate fathers day with my in laws and it was quite an embarrassment to receive this kind of service. I do understand it was a holiday, it was busy and we were a party of 9 but I don't think that her frustration should have been taken out on our customers. Again I would definitely give Century House another shot because of the food quality but if I received the same service again I would definitely rule it out (However I don't think that would be the case as we saw all of the waitstaff for the surrounding tables being quite pleasant despite the day being busy)."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It was a pleasure to eat at Jake's.

The duck was so smoky, I was waiting for it to sit up and light a cigar. It was also incredibly tender. The truffled yucca fries (awesome concept) were also great.\\n\\nFor drinks, the sangria and Hibiscus Caipirinha were both lovely, but by far the stand-out favorite was the Habanero Watermelon Margarita.

I think the hype sort of masks the actual taste of the giant piece of grilled ground beef, smothered in cheese and grilled onions, topped with 2 slices of bacon and hugged by 2 grilled donuts.

The sides I had were the onion rings- nice and perfectly crispy! The jalape√±o creamed corn- where have you been all my life?? And finally Brussels with bacon...perfect way to serve em in my opinion!

The garlic rolls were easily the highlight. Buttery, garlicky, salty -- and the Alfredo to dip them in was a great idea. I didn't detect any kind of canned taste as other reviewers have noted, but then again, I scarfed them pretty fast, because they were incredibly good. \\n\\nThe fried ravioli was a bit disappointing. It wasn't bad, and I polished it off, it just really didn't taste like anything. \\n\\nThe pizza was quite good. I liked the way it was light on the tomato sauce and heavy on the vegetables, so you could actually taste the toppings. I didn't eat it when it was hot (I ate too many rolls and ravioli), but it reheated well a few hours later and was tasty. \\n\\nIf there was one slight negative thing, it was the delivery driver, and to be fair, he really seemed to be having an awful day. I mostly felt sorry for him. He took my money and pocketed it, then asked if I wanted plates. I'd never thought to ask, so since I'm in a hotel, I said yes. As he fumbled in his bag for them, he said he was sorry but he was in a horrible mood because the restaurant was short-staffed and, from what I could tell from his muttering, this wasn't his usual job. It's too bad he didn't at least glance at the money I had handed him. I'm probably the only person today who tipped him $10. \\n\\nFood seemed solid enough.

Was very disappointed:\\n~ We ordered simple chili cheese with onions and mustard hot dogs on poppy seed buns.  The food was barely warm.  It was no better than a Dairy Queen cheese coney, but was a lot more expensive.  (Diner Alert:  Phillips Coney Island or Skyline ChiIi and Hot Dogs would have been a far better choice.)\\n~ We expected to get frosty root beers when we ordered the Frostop root beer.  Instead, it arrived cool, probably because there was NO ICE in it.  (I asked for a glass of ice to add to it.)\\n~ Incidentally, there were people waiting outside in the hot sun to get a table.  The place is very small and cramped.  They should at least put an umbrella or two outside for shade while people wait to get seated.  (Good luck waiting in rain, snow or cold weather, folks.)\\n~ Incidentally, when I gave the doorman/host the number in our party (two) and our  name, we waited tto be seated at the front of the restaurant.  (Fortunately, there were two chairs we could sit in, everyone else had to stand inside, if they were lucky).  Ten minutes later, in walked a party of three who walked right up to the bar and seated themselves.  When I mentioned to the doorman/host that we would have taken bar seating had he mentioned it (he didn't mention it to two other parties, either), he apologized.\\n~ When we did get a small table for two, my chair was jutting out in the way of the kitchen service area, and waiters/waitresses had to squeeze by to serve customers.  The radio and noise from the kitchen was very loud and unpleasant.  I changed seats with my partner, because I was getting a headache from the clamor\\n~ The artwork was primitive, although the subject (pop and rock stars) held promise.\\n~ If they want to make things right, Dirty Frank's can contact me.  I'd like to give them a chance to make things right.  Otherwise, I will not return on my dime."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This spot has the old school vibe that I appreciate, including white coat servers.

However, be warned, if there's more than 3 or 4 of you, seating might be a little tough.\\n\\nFat Matt's is a little quaint barbecue spot and the taste is one of the best around. Their menu is limited to a degree; mostly consisting of ribs (sandwich style, 1/2 and full racks) and chicken (1/4 and 1/2). Their meat is soft and tender and, as cliche as it is to say about barbecue, the meat really does fall off the bone. I had the rib sandwich and was able to pull the meat straight off the bone with the bread from my sandwich. Their barbecue sauce is on the map as one of the best in ATL and i'd have to concur. Sweet with a hint of smokey flavor and a little on the thicker side so it sits on the food just right. Their sides are what everyone craves when having good barbecue. Brunswick stew, baked beans, green beans, mac and cheese, etc. Their prices for their sides are nice (considering they are sold separate) but their portion sizes reflect those prices. Drink selection is Coca Cola products, lemonade (reg. and diet) and sweet/unsweet tea.\\n\\nThe cons, as all places have, are: seating is on the bad side of limited. I usually like smaller joints b/c it adds a \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" feel, but during the busy time, this place gets cramped. I left the table satisfied, but I'd like to see their portion sizes go up a bit. Their brunswick stew and mac and cheese sides were served in a little bowl that seemed smaller than the container the bbq sauce was served in. I didn't check out the bathroom situation. Parking can also get limited during heavy hours (which can be expected for a smaller place like this). All in all the cons only dropped it half a star, but i can't do half a star and i'm a bit of a \\"round down\\" kinda guy.\\n\\nI can't NOT mention the music. Probably what put Fat Matt's on the map is their live jazz music I went for lunch at noon or so and there was someone playing for the lunch crowd. It's my understanding that this music goes on all day every day. There's something to be said about a place that's willing to put on music for a crowd of 60 people or 6 people. Dedication to customer satisfaction and atmosphere!\\n\\nPlease, if you live in Atlanta or are just visiting, check out Fat Matt's on Piedmont, if you're dissatisfied please let me know of a better place and I'll happily weigh in on your ideas."},{"name":"Ward 8","address":"90 N Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I came here last week for drinks and a quick bite.

They have every type of burger option: hamburger, chicken, veggie, portobello mushroom, etc. So, I imagine it works well for those that are veggie. Everything is a la carte so you basically pay three to five dollars for the burger and bun. Then each topping is extra. This is either great or not so great depending on your burger eating style. I'm guessing if you like a burger with a lot of toppings it isn't very economical. However, if you have a few things you like on your burger then my guess is you pay less for a decent burger here. \\n\\nIn addition to the burgers, they have mondo servings of fries and a bunch of deserts.

I LOVED that the ginger beer was not overly carbonated (i.e., must be made homemade on site), yummy high quality rum (which also makes it a pricier bevie but oh so worth it) and just a slice of lime. I think they may have added bitters which i do not object.

We had some pretty decent pulled pork on the table as well, but not the best I've had (I'm from North Carolina where it's at!).

The salsa is also quite tasty. I like that you can get jambalaya instead of rice and beans (go Cajun!). My pals love the catfish fajitas. Magaritas are passable and they have Negro Modelo, my fave Mexican beer.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this place is that it is CHEAP!

The hostess greeted me as soon as I got to her podium and then... I waited - almost five minutes, according to my phone. Now, if it was busy, I would have no issue with waiting but there were only two other parties in the entire restaurant at the time so I'm not exactly sure what she was doing while pecking away at her computer screen.\\n\\nAnyway, I was seated and then I waited again for almost 10 minutes before someone took my drink order.

The pickles took about 20 minutes and then it was another 30 minutes until our entree came out. All together, we were in the restaurant for about an hour and a half, which is not good for an area near a huge school and a lot of businesses. If the wait times are always that long, B&B Joint is going to miss out on a lot of business from people who only have the standard hour for lunch - and they can definitely forget about the 30 minute crowd. Our server was pleasant, if just a tad too eager.\\n\\nThe food was mediocre. The chicken sandwich I ordered was bland; the lettuce was wilted and the sauces and guacamole were non-existent. The pickles were very soggy. \\n\\nThe prices at B&B are ridiculous. My chicken sandwich was $7-8 - a lunch special - and came without a side. For two beers, a sandwich, and a side of fries, my bill came to $24. That's not really a lunch special to me; I felt jipped. By the time I got it, it was also cold. \\n\\nOne of the beers I ordered was $9 and it's a fairly common craft beer.

I tend to sailor dive with reckless abandon and an aim to take out any passerby or children in the vicinity.  Thats what led me to take a brief break from years of vegetarianism and try what was rumored to be the country's best barbecue.\\n\\nI'm an Austinite through and through and as such have always had a nagging love for brisket and ribs, although I managed to push it far back in my mind.  When Baines K. suggested we get up early and stand in line for barbecue however, I though, \\"What the hell, it beats work!\\"\\n\\nA few minutes before ten, we pulled in to the parking lot and found our place in line, behind what was probably a hundred people that apparently wanted food more than we did.  I was impressed to see how dedicated people could be, sacrificing their sleeping-in/work/court time, all in pursuit of pulled pork.  No one was complaining about the wait, despite the fact that the doors wouldn't even open for another hour; Quite the contrary actually, we all seemed to be enjoying this simple, slow way of spending our morning.  No meetings, no Mopac, no screaming kids, just an ever-growing group of people, some from Austin, many others from all over the world, patiently waiting, making friends, and anticipating.\\n\\nAbout thirty minutes before the first plate would be served, a chipper girl in her twenties came through the line, taking pre-orders so that she would know at what point to start turning people away that had arrived too late (it's a good plan, but its screwed up by the hoards of overly made-up soccer moms, arriving just in time to bring six of their closest Stepford Friends to the prime spot in line that some unlucky husband waited for since 8AM).  Once she reached the point where the food would be exhausted, she told everyone left that there was no guarantee that they would be fed.  Many left, some chose to stay and chance it.\\n\\nThe walls lining the approach to the counter are covered with magazine and newspaper reviews, raving about the little up-start that could (and did).  Hard to believe that all this fuss could be created by a young guy with a trailer and a second-hand smoker off of I-35...  It's an interesting thing to see if you pay attention, almost a time line covering the brief few years Franklin has existed and the meteoric rise they've experienced.\\n\\nLets cut to the good stuff though.  At that crucial moment when I was asked what I wanted, I realized, I could either have another serving of coleslaw and watch people sink their teeth into what many say is the best example of barbecue in existence, or I could make an exception to my dietary restrictions and find out for myself what everyone was so excited about.  Screw it.  Lets eat.\\n\\nBaines K. ordered a brisket sandwich, I had a Tipsy Texan (a DELICIOUS sandwich piled high with chopped beef, sausage, coleslaw, pickles, and onions) and we split an order of pork ribs the size of my kid's forearm.  Ridiculous.  Pure ridiculous.  Two light eaters, faced with a week's worth of meat on a Tuesday just before noon.\\n\\nChallenge accepted!\\n\\nWe were both immediately impressed with the tenderness and delicious flavors in the ribs, each of us failing to find words, instead just blankly staring while uttering incomprehensible sounds, interspersed with \\"Jesus\\".  When it came time for the sandwiches, we each tried a bite of the the other one's wanting to taste as much as possible.  The brisket was tender with a great crust of pepper and spices, a delicious smokey flavor through all of it, the chopped beef was perfectly cooked and cut, every bite with just a bit of fat, the sausage absolutely amazing, thanks to a special ingredient that Aaron Franklin, the proprietor and pit master will be happy to share with you.\\n\\nAfter an hour of gorging ourselves and downing a beer, there was nothing we could do but attempt to drive home before the imminent food comas (see \\"itis\\") set in.  As we drove away, I was very happy I'd set aside the meat restriction for the morning to experience what was, by far, the best meal I've ever had.  I don't plan to go full-blown carnivore anytime soon, but I guarantee I'll be back at Franklin.  After all, we still have to try the pulled pork and the trukey!\\n\\nOh!  Prices... cheap.

I got in line around 8:45am and was around the 30th person in line. Around 9-9:30am, the staff comes around to give a time estimate and ask what you're thinking of ordering so they know when to tell people they might run out, which I thought was a nice courtesy. A bit later, another member of the staff came out to sell some beer. What's nice about Franklin's is that it is BYOB friendly and many people in line brought coolers (which people ingeniously brought to store drinks but then later fill with meat) or went to the nearby CVS to buy. Franklin's also provided coffee for free in the back.\\n\\nI got a 11:30 service estimate and it was on point. I think I got served just a little before that. By the time I left around noon, the line wasn't that long out the door anymore. So I think everyone that was there when I left would get served by 1pm. Then again, this was a Thursday so definitely wouldn't be the case on a weekend.\\n\\n\\"Whoa, that's a lot of meat.\\" That's essentially what I will remember about this place. Because the longer I waited in line, the bigger my order got. What was initially a conservative pound of brisket and 1/2 pound of ribs evolved into 2 pounds of brisket, 1 pound of ribs, 1/2 pound of pulled pork, and 2 pies. I came alone. I swear, I didn't eat it all and it wasn't all just for me..!\\n\\nSo there I was, sitting at a table with 3.5 pounds of meat in front of me, while a bunch of hungry eyes in line were staring at the meat, then me, followed by friendly laughter. I tried, I really did. But I only ate like 2 slices of brisket, 1 rib, and a pulled pork sandwich. I was full for the rest of the day. I think it was the salt. It's so good but it is really hard to eat that much in one sitting. Make sure to go get some of the pickles and onions, it really helped.\\n\\nThe brisket was by far the best thing I had here. Especially that hot, fresh, fatty piece that they cut for you to try while you order. There is nothing like fresh marbled warm fat. They ask if you want lean or moist. I had no idea so I opted for a bit of everything. I can safely say now, just get the fat. It's so much better. Though the lean would be good paired with sauce or on the bread as well. The fattier version also kept better when I had it over the next few days.\\n\\nThe ribs were really good as well. I loved that it was a dry preparation, and it was tender and juicy. I like pulled pork but I don't think I've ever had a version that was much better or worse than any other place's. While Franklin's was good, I probably wouldn't get it again. That being said, it did taste great with some vinegary hot sauce and toast.\\n\\nIs this place worth it? I say yes. I think you gotta at least do the line once. It's fun, especially if you have friends with you. Everyone is so friendly - both staff and patrons. I loved how staff would come by and ask how you're liking everything, if everyone's comfortable, etc. If you can avoid the line after that, this place is always worth it.

Dropped by around 10pm for a drink with friends after having a great dinner at Red Lantern. We entered the bar area and sat by the side stools waiting for service and ordered a few drinks. We had been waiting for a while just sitting there and were then approached by a bartender that rudely informed us that our drinks wouldn't be coming because we were really drunk and she didn't feel comfortable serving us. Despite the fact that we all only had one drink with dinner, and were clearly not intoxicated, it was the manner and tone in which she approached us that I thought was completely inappropriate. This is my second time trying this establishment and each visit continues to disappoint me more and more. We decided to leave and on my way out I stopped by and politely asked what, in her opinion, made us seem unfit to serve. Her immediate response was that she couldn't believe I was asking her and that I was being confrontational. At the end of the day, she didn't have an answer. I've worked in food service so I understand the fear of restaurants in over serving. Each bartender has a right to make their own judgement calls. I'm more so disappointed in the manner that this was handled and the treatment of this establishment's customers.

I can make it here, order foods, and finish eating before the next class started !!! On top of that, I love how they are able to customize how spicy you wanted your food to be. The guy who was helping me was very supportive about all my inquiries about the foods, despite they are being a little busy. \\n\\nSecond, The food (5/5)\\nI had the chicken plate. Literally, one of the best chicken I have ever had. Everything was well seasoned, and the rice was cooked to perfection. Every student complaining about not eating healthy, not if you eat here. Lean chicken meat, with your carb (rice), and a crap ton of veggies to fill your veggie portion for the day. Their meal is really well made. I mean you spend about 8$ at SAC anyway. So the price is not really that expensive. On top of that, it is really filling !! I just had one chicken plate and I was full till dinner. I really recommend their white sauce(signature white sauce). It goes well with everything. \\nI have tried this kind of food at multiple food trucks in Austin but these guys really know what they're doing. \\n\\nLastly, the location. (5/5)\\nIt is located literally right in front of the tower !!! It is super convenience for people wanting to grab a quick meal before heading to class or after or If you live on campus or in the general area who want good, and lean foods for a very reasonable price, I would recommend you guys stop by here. It is literally in the middle of all the attraction around downtown.  \\n\\nOverall, this will be one of the place I would always stop by, and recommend people to come by. Also, this is a local business. Show some love for local business !!!!!! \\n\\nI would say they should open till a later 8pm on weekdays.\\n\\nI will definitely be eating here very often from now on."},{"name":"Paul's Omelettery Restaurant","address":"2211 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I saw the Yelp reviews and always wanted to try this place.

It was more liquid-y than most I've had but I must say it was quite good. Very Spicy. More rice would have made it better.\\nMy steak took almost an hour to be served. My waitress knew it was taking long and kept apologizing. She blamed it on a backed up kitchen but the restaurant was only about 2/3 full. I ordered my steak Medium Well; which to me, means warm pink on the inside. When it came, it was well done. Not slightly well done but WELL done. In fact it leaned from well done to slightly charcoal, versus medium well to well. Then there's the choice of meat; it was tough. I mean eating it was like chewing on shoe leather. My perception can be a little skewered because I'm from Kansas City, Missouri and we know meat. Whether you smoke it, barbecue it, grill it or whatever, we have the best beef in the country. That being said, even for Atlanta standards, this was a poor choice of beef.\\nI never complained about the service or food, or anything to my waitress.

Assuming it was the delay in my service, she automatically offered me a discount for the delay in my meal. I politely thanked her and said it wasn't necessary. She gave it to me anyways.

They also have a weird selection including egg nog and frangelico (which they tried to pawn off on us as \\"free shots with purchase\\" - no thanks). \\n\\nThere is a selection of margaritas as well as the shots and flights of shots, and I have to say the Jalapeno is delicious! They have classics, but also dabble in the more exotic with hibiscus, avocado, blood orange, etc. Apparently some of the margaritas are premade with the alcohol already, so you can't switch the tequilas out (but they do offer a \\"double shot\\"). We also tried the infused flight - and for the price of four ($21) I did not expect to get four overflowing glasses full of tequila (i was thinking maybe 1/2 - 3/4 full shots, since alone they each cost $10). Upon trying them, I realized why they just needed to get rid of the stuff. The jalapeno is good, the hibiscus is interesting, the tropical was not awful, but the cocoa was downright nasty. Luckily, they made the ones we didn't hate into margaritas for free. \\n\\nThe food menu is fairly basic, lots of chips and dips (we tried the trio and the queso and the guac are both good - the salsa was not our favorite), crab tostadas, and a few other options.

Somehow, even with this divine instruction, it took me 2 and a half years to get there.  \\n\\nAfter finding myself downtown with a few coworkers after some sort of flee market shopping trip, we decided an early lunch was in order.  The heavens spoke to me and I immediately suggested DF's.  We got there right before it opened and there were already a few people waiting outside.  After entering I can see why, the place is pretty small and getting a table is probably an issue most days/times. \\n\\nI know that DF's has alcohol slushies but I wasn't going to go there at 11 am (What? Kristen, you couldn't drink at 11 am on a Saturday? OK fine, I was still hung over from the previous nights activities, are you happy now???).  That said, I took a 'when in Rome' approach and ordered grape fountain pop.  I was super thirsty (see: dehydrated) and happy to find that the drinks are served in what I can only describe as a giant red plastic drum.  Kudos. \\n\\nThe 3 of us decided to order 2 dogs each and then split them up so we could try all 6.  We also ordered a side of onion rings which was disappointing. The basket of rings came out and contained 4 rings.  On what planet is 4 onion rings a basket?  Not on mine. OK lets talk dogs.  \\n\\nOverall the flavor of the dogs is good, I really like the poppy seed buns too.  Here are the types we tried: \\n\\nRazzle Dazzle: Cream cheese, peppers and onions.  This was by far my favorite. The contrast of the warm salty dog, cool cream cheese and the snap of the raw peppers and onions was a perfect combination. 5/5 stars\\n\\nSour kraut dog: Sour kraut and spicy brown mustard. This was not my pick and it was just OK 3/5 stars.\\n\\nThe Classy lady: Cheese sauce and potato chips-crushed. I wanted so badly to love this one but I thought the cheese sauce was a little too thick, a little too heavy for the delicate dog and the chips.  Naturally I still enjoyed it but think the sauce could be tweaked.  4/5 stars. \\n\\nSarva's Tot-Cho Dog: Cheese sauce, tator tots, onion, jalapenos. More of the same cheese sauce but good flavors.  Note, we removed all traces of the jalapeno so not sure how that added to the overall flavor.  3/5 stars. \\n\\nLara's Pittsburgh Princess: Fries, slaw and malt vinegar.  This was another that I really liked - good contrast with the crunchy slaw, soft fries and the dog. 4/5 stars\\n\\nAmy's Big Boston Dog: Baked beans, cheddar cheese and onion.  The beans were a little mushy and it didn't do a lot for me. 3/5 stars. \\n\\nThe waitstaff was not super friendly and that bothered me because they place should have a fun atmosphere.  This is probably the top reason I cannot give this place 5 stars.

I'll start by saying, I had a bad experience making the reservation. I donated blood through the little red bus, I was given a free admission to the show plus 1/2 off for a guest. Well I decided to take the family, I have two 2 1/2 year old twins. So I went on line to book the show, I couldn't get past the promotional code from my blood donation voucher so I decided to call in my reservation. On line when I tried, I got as far as ordering the tickets for 4, meals which included chicken nuggets and Mac&cheese for the twins, ( by the way children under 3 are free) which I thought included the meal. When I called I spoke to a lady, which I did not get her name. When I explained what I had tried to do on line and that I had donated blood for a free admission, 1/2 a second ticket and I have two year old twins, she began to quote me a price, explaining that I would have to upgrade the infants to a child which cost 6.99$ each. I told her that I thought the kids ate for free, according to the reservation I attempted, they eat for free. She said no that I was wrong and the twins would cost 6.99$, I was a bit disturbed, but decided to make reservations regardless. I told the reservation specialist that I wasn't going to argue with her, that I would be making the reservation and pay the 6.99$, then she vanished and put me back in the call rotation! I waited 13 minutes before I decided to hang up. I was so upset, called again!left a message with administration. I still wasn't satisfied! I called again, spoke to Nepal asked how many agents work there, he advised he couldn't give me that information, I replied, I want to speak to a manager, he kindly transferred me to administration. I decided to drive there and speak to some one!!! When I arrived, I went to the main office and found myself explaining my story to tony cardosa, what a great man! Turns out he's the Vice President/ general manager. He took time to listen to my story, apologized and helped me make my reservation. Once we were done he explained that when I arrive on Sunday 10/16/2016, that I should take my tickets to Carlos or Carissa and they would take care of me. He wrote a note on my reservation to either Carlos/Carrissa, ( maybe Marisa) I really can't remember the second name. Upon my arrival on Sunday, I explained to the ticket booth attendant that I need to speak with either Carlos or Carrissa/Marrisa. He explained that Carlos was on duty and he would get him right away. Carlos approached me with sincere concern and professionalism. He took time to read the note written by Mr. Cardosa and quickly invited me, my fianc√©, and twins inside to a separate booth where he assured me that I would be taken care of. Sure enough, we were upgraded to VIP, where we were escorted to a VIP  appetizer area where we were treated to Shrimp, meat balls, mozzarella sticks, cheeses, salads, fruit, rolled salami, bruschetta bread, mozzarella with slices of tomatoes. It was a very nice display!!! VIP is definitely the way to go!!! When it was time to enter the main area, we were seated in the purple section, our vampire was awesome!!! We really enjoyed or seats, we were in the front row, in front of all the action and adventure!!! We were given unlimited pitchers of beer, soda, water!! The food was very good, dessert was also included and very good. We truly felt like VIP!! I want to thank the staff, mgt, actors, and our server for an excellent evening!! We will return for sure!!!

The food was excellent. No question about that.  I had never had ramen noodle soup before (other than the obligatory .20 bags we bought in college) so I can't compare the food quality to another ramen place. It was the dining experience that I didn't enjoy.\\n\\nSome people don't mind standing in a long line for food, concerts, movies or whatever. I am not one of those people.  First of all the restaurant is located in a strip mall  on Hwy 183 and it's exact location is on the side of the mall that gets full afternoon sun. It's only 78 degrees in Austin today but standing in a line on concrete in the full sun made it feel like it was at least 90 degrees. We had heard there would be a wait (we heard about 20 minutes or so) and we arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant opened for dinner at 5pm to find a very long line - if I had to guess I would say there were about 70 people in front of us.\\n\\nWe waited 50 minutes just to get inside the door of the restaurant which seats only 39 people (at which point I was drenched in sweat).  It took another 15 minutes to inch our way up to the counter where you place your order and are given a number to take your table so the waitstaff can bring your food when its ready. Then we had to stand against a wall and wait until a table opened up.  By the time we got seated and had food in front of us our total wait time was 1 hour and 25 minutes, most of it spent sweating in the sun.  \\n\\nThe waitstaff aren't really waiters in the traditional sense of the word.  No one offers you more drinks and, very occasionally, someone comes around to fill your small water glass. When we decided we would each like a beer we grabbed a waitress who brought us the beers and told us we would have to go back up front and pay. In other words we had to cut in front of a line full of hungry and sweaty people to pay for our beer.  This is Austin and people were nice about it but, seriously, is that the best way handle drink orders?\\n\\nThe noodles were fresh and delicious and the broth was wonderful. We ordered gyoza as an appetizer and it was clear the ingredients were very fresh.\\n\\nBut I will never go back to this place. Totally not worth the hassle in my book.

So with such a shaky beginning you would think that my rating would be bad and it is quite the opposite. I ordered BBQ by the pound: why waste any time on sides at a smokehouse......so I ordered fatty and lean brisket. For a vegetable course, I had them throw in a couple of pork ribs. I had enough food for two people....and in that pile of smoked goodness, I had the best Brisket in the world. BEST EVER. PERIOD. WOW. (yep, the fatty brisket) There were three sauces and to be honest I can't imagine destroying the smoked perfection with any of them. I won't hold it against you if you are a saucehead.... Now, about those vegetables, they were amazing. I have had my fair share of ribs, and some have been pretty good. These ribs were top notch and truly fell right off the bone.

Ultimately, it took way too long to even get the appetizers/drinks so we ended up just getting the check and going next door to Merrill & Co.  \\n\\nTo make matters worse, the service itself was mediocre at best. When we asked our server about certain wines, he told us he would find out more information then reappeared no less than 25 minutes later without having asked anyone.

Or perhaps more accurately, the 4 1/2 hour wait went FAR more quickly than I would have imagined, and once inside, the food lived up to the billing, so much so that too much of a good thing is bad (knowing I wouldn't visit again any time soon, I ordered 3/4 lb. of the brisket (mixed lean & moist), and a 1/2 lb. of the ribs (two large ribs). At the outset, it was otherworldly delicious, living up to expectations, but by the last few bites, it was simply too much. If I were to do it again, I'd have cut my portion in half. Better ending on a superior high note wanting more than shoving down the last few bites because it's simply too good to throw away.\\n\\nIf I can contribute anything worth noting in this review, it's my observations about the wait. First, and as I intimated above, the time really does go fast. It's remarkable. When I was reading reviews, seeing people wait three, four, or more hours for service, I really didn't think it would be worth the wait. And in many respects, it isn't. Delicious as it is, it's just food after all. That being said, the wait really is far less onerous in reality than it sounds when you're reading these reviews. And that is true not only for the extroverted among us, who can certainly pass the time talking to others, but also for those more like me (I'm a raging introvert). I simply brought my book bag and got some work done that I have been wanting to do for a very long time but never seemed to find the time to do. In this sense, being held captive by the line was a blessing. However, there are some important things to keep in mind:\\n\\n1) Arrive very early if you can, trying to be near the very front of the line. The reason is simple: by the time the restaurant opens at 11, there are probably 150-200 people in line. And while there are indeed tons of chairs available to sit on (stored underneath the building near the entrance ramp in the parking lot), the staff asks everyone to put their chairs away when the restaurant opens, at least if you are among the first 50-75 people waiting underneath the overhang, on the ramp that winds back and forth like an amusement park line. Interpretation? Once the chairs are put up, you could still be waiting an hour or more to get your food even after the restaurant opens if you're in the middle of the pack somewhere - close enough to the front that you had a seat initially, but far enough back that you have to then stand in the cafeteria-style line until everyone in front of you orders. So, the moral of the story is get there as early as possible. In my case, I went on a Tuesday morning (March 8, 2016), arriving at 6:30am, and I arrived at the same time as an Australian couple, making us the first three squatters. I had ordered and was eating at my table 10 minutes after the restaurant opened, while others who were only a few dozen spots behind me were still in line, now standing, even thirty minutes later when I had finished and was leaving.\\n\\n2) They open the restaurant bathrooms to the would-be diners somewhere around 9am, if I remember correctly. This is huge if you have indeed been waiting several hours by this point, particularly if you are in line alone, as I was. Your chair can hold your spot for you, and people take turns, so that was a great relief, literally.\\n\\n3) Don't be too fussed about the weather. If you're early enough, you'll be under the overhang anyway, so you'll have protection from direct sun and rain. It in fact poured at one point while we were waiting, but it was actually quite pleasant, as it was breezy and we were kept dry by the overhang. In this respect, weather is really a non-issue if you're early enough. The only thing I suggest is bringing a sweater and/or dressing in layers because, at least on this day, the weather conditions changed a lot in the 4+ hours spent waiting.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a great visit. The wait was far less ugly than anticipated and the food really is that good. The staff, down to the very last person, was great too, as were my fellow squatters.\\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"being from nyc, i'm anything BUT a connoisseur of southern food, but i sure as hell know what i like... and what i like is the food at south city kitchen - midtown!  i recently had a business trip to atlanta, and after checking out online reviews for the restaurants surrounding our hotel, my bf and i decided on this restaurant.  fried green tomatoes?  yes, please!  and more of them!  they were delicious!!  to be completely honest, i'd only had them once before at dinosaur bbq; they were good there, too, but these were different, a bit more \\"gourmet\\" with the goat cheese and all.\\n\\nfor the main course, i had the \\"boo-yah! base\\" and my bf had the pork.  mine was really good - okra was a nice surprise since it's not very common up here - but his was really tasty, even down to the kale!  so good!  \\n\\nand the drinks were good, and a good size... just like the food.  \\nand the biscuits and corn bread!!  omg!!\\nwe were so full but squeezed in a coconut sorbet.  yummm!  a bit tangy for my bf, but i liked it.  \\n\\ni can't forget about the service, either.  our waitress was sooo friendly and helpful and attentive.  \\n\\nthe restaurant is located on a short strip with several bars, lounges, and restaurants.  we didn't check them out but they were certainly getting quite crowded by the time 11pm rolled around.\\n\\nwhen/if i go back to midtown atl, i'd DEFINITELY stop here again!!"},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"The bhindi masala is my favorite, but all of the other many vegetarian foods are delicious too!

I didn't just want to eat chicken so I asked the server if they have a rice bowl of some sort with pork or beef and she said, \\"yes, beef!\\" So, I asked if its like beef strips kinda like teriyaki style and she nodded so I said, ok I'll get one! \\n\\nFood arrived and I mixed my bowl. Guess what? It was a medium sized bowl with rice and literally a teaspoon or not even of ground beef mixed with veggies. ( it ended up to be the dish called bibimbap, don't get me wrong coz I had that dish a couple of times and it was good but keep in mind that I ordered for something else )  I was so hungry that I had a spoon or two but to my dismay, I stopped and asked the server why did she say beef strip when its all veggies mixed with a teaspoon of ground beef!? She took my spoon and mixed the bowl to check herself, in front of me, and took my bowl without saying a word! \\n\\nShe took it to the counter and both her and the lady cashier were talking and looking at me. At this point by the way, our chicken was still nowhere. We stood up and asked both of them whats going on!? All of a sudden, their chef came out of the kitchen with one more teaspoon of ground beef and placed it on my then cold meal to hopefully make me feel better! LOL.. We were so shocked on how rude and unprofessional they were so right there and then, we just asked them to wrap the chicken to go and got the bill immediately. I cancelled my meal obviously and will not pay a dime for it. No tip either. We just stormed out of the place and realized that I wasn't even hungry anymore. What a horrible experience! \\n\\nTo be fair, their chicken wasn't too bad but nothing special. Pretty mediocre."},{"name":"Mo Cha Tea House","address":"12520 SW Farmington Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"They have the best bubble smoothies and coconut pudding in an actual young coconut.

When I ate there last night 8/11 people in our group ordered some kind of pulled pork and the waitress had to come back and tell us they didn't  have enough left for everyone to get it (this was about 9:30 pm) which created  a Hunger Games style battle to the death over the last of the pig. \\n\\nAppetizers- get the fried ribs. They may have other appetizers, I'm not sure because FRIED RIBS. \\n\\nEntrees- I always get some kind of combo plate so I can try multiple meats and sides but if you are some sort of communist I guess you could just get a pulled pork sandwich or something else anti-american- I mean 2 of the negative reviews I saw were about the burger.... ITS A BBQ PLACE WHY ARE YOU ORDERING A BURGER??? I'm sure Fox Bros has really bad Chow Mein but I would never know cause I learned at an early age how to order at a restaurant properly. \\n\\nChicken wings- Many people hate on the bird at a BBQ place but it can be pretty tasty. The wings here are very good (recommend getting all drums)\\n\\nBrisket- another fiasco last night they only had chopped brisket but it was still pretty good (but if available you want sliced for sure). Overall brisket is a pretty key component of any BBQ experience and this one doesn't let you down. One thing I like is that it doesn't come slathered in sauce so you can sauce it to your liking- if you think its a little dry just add more. \\n\\nRibs- the average person has no idea what the difference is between various types of ribs and really you can't go wrong. For the distinguishing BBQ fan the Texas Spare Rib is your move. \\n\\nPulled Pork- delicious, melt in your mouth goodness. I don't care for the sandwich because the bread just waters down the pork taste. \\n\\n\\nSides, in order\\nBrunswick Stew\\nMac and Cheese\\nChili \\nBaked Beans\\nFrito Pie\\n\\nCorn Bread- make sure you get some of this - its great.

The menu description makes it sounds delicious but it was anything but.  \\n\\nThere were huge chunks of kimchi, as well as 3 chunks of pork over cold shriveled fries.  The pork was very overcooked, dried up and hard.    The kimchi should have been chopped up, as you only get 2 giants bites of it.  After you get past the toppings the fries are dry and flavorless.\\n\\nThe sandwich again had very overcooked fried chicken and the toppings all sat on top, with not much sauce, so this ended up being very dry as well.  The meat portion was bordering on tiny.\\n\\nI didn't finish either dish and probably wouldn't have had more than a couple bites if I wasn't starving and had already paid for it.\\n\\nI also waited about 15-20 minutes for food.

I'm forever in search of THE BEST steak in Portland. Nothing has compared to Craftsteak in Vegas. Portland City Grill came pretty close, however.\\n\\nIn the end, the Steelhead was calling my name. Fresh Steelhead with Wild Oregon Bay shrimp and a basil butter sauce. It was a really light sauce, not creamy at all, and I prefer those kinds of sauces. I asked the waiter if I could substitute the roasted potatoes with a salad and he said no.  He said they could give me extra veggies instead of potatoes but I said nevermind. Seemed weird they don't substitute.\\n\\nThe fish was perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth! The sauce was tangy and delicious. \\n\\nordered the Cheese Ravioli with Crab. It came in a cream sauce with chunks of goat cheese, spinach, and basil. I snagged a few bites and it was great too!\\n\\nI've never had Key Lime Pie in my life but ordered it for dessert. I wasn't sure what to expect. It was tangy and bitter, but in a good way. The little bit of whipped cream was just sweet enough to balance it out and the graham cracker crust was thick and crunchy! It was fantastic. I don't regret splitting it thought because it's very rich.\\n\\nAll in all, great food, pretty decent service. I suggest making a reservation.

We waited several minutes before the waitress said \\"Im sorry but the printer is broken so it will be a few more minutes. What does that have to do with getting our chips???  Why couldn't she just go get the The chips? But she made us wait until the printer in the kitchen went back up! When we finally got the chips and salsa we were very disappointed. The  chips were crunched up in tiny little pieces like the bottom of the bag.  I asked for chips that weren't all crunched up but I didn't want to wait again for the ticket printer. The waitress said\\" oh no worries I will just get you new ones\\". Why couldn't she do that before?? The tacos were very expensive for how small they were and the meat was cold inside them.  Advice I would give to this new restaurant is 1).  chips and salsa for free especially considering how expensive the rest of the meat is.  2). Cut the price down if you want return customers.

I ordered the Chicken and Waffle, while he ordered the fried chicken, biscuits and gravy with a side of grits. I had struggled with my choice because the base price for a single piece chicken with a waffle is about $10 or $11 (can't quite remember), while each subsequent piece is $2 each. My innate sense of best value screamed that the three piece was the better deal by a wide margin, but I wasn't sure that my stomach could take it. \\n\\nThe spirit is willing but the body is weak.\\n\\nAnyways, I got the one piece while pretty much everyone else at other tables got the three piece. However, I did note that the portion is extremely generous, and when we got our meals, I had no regrets, The chicken was large and perfectly breaded and fried while the waffle was delicious and substantial. So crispy, yet warm and tender inside (that goes for both the chicken and waffle). It was far and away the best chicken and waffle I've ever had.\\n\\nMy boyfriend's meal was equally delicious and highly recommended if you are not in the mood for sweet. Although he enjoyed the main item, he finally decided he hates grits in general if he did not even like it at Screen Door. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is a bit loud and can get crowded quickly (30 minute wait on a Thursday morning), but it is worth it!

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes, it really is that good. I was looking for BBQ done with passion and character for a long time before coming here.\\n \\nWhen BBQ offers the primal satisfaction all smoked meats should aspire to, sauce is an extra. Not a requirement. The meat must climb the mountain of greatness on its own. The rub must push it over-the-top. Sauce is there only to allow the culinary experience to float away into the heavens. \\n\\nThe Fox Bros menu is well-thought-out. It offers just what you want in an array of the diverse BBQ of the south. Fried okra, Frito Pie. You even have the option of meat on your Mac and Cheese. \\"Fox's Mac\\" is topped with a tomato-ey Brunswick Stew filled with smoked chicken and chunks of potatoes.\\n\\nThe sliced brisket was flawlessly smoked, done slow until the collagen drenches the meat in unctuous rich beef flavor, complemented by a simple and effective savory rub. Highly recommended. (they were running out of the sliced brisket when we arrived)\\n\\nPork Spare Ribs (listed simply as \\"ribs\\" on the menu.) There is a depth of flavor and an herby complexity in the rub. The spices meld and deepen during cooking but do not turn harsh and carbonized. Tender, hickory smoky, perfect ribness.\\n\\nPork Babyback Ribs (Monday Only Special.) These were terrible. Dry and tough. She ate one bite and pushed her plate away. I didn't even realize what was going on over there, until I'd finished my meal and I tried her plate. What the heck? Yes, Fox's still gets Five Stars - they swapped out the uneaten Baby Backs for spare ribs, and the server was totally cool about it. Everybody drops the ball once in a while.

(who is on Yelp, you oughta look him up, but his reviews might not do a Bostonian much good, as he has transplanted his'self to the Big Apple - Brooklyn branch) was hanging out with me this one time in Coolidge Corner, and it was eating time. He's Jewish, I'll just throw that out there. I will also say that I grew up in the sticks of NH, and the town where I did all that growing up in didn't even have a real resturaunt in it for a long time, and when they finally did get a restaurant that was personally owned and not a fast food chain, it was so disgusting that I wouldn't be caught dead in there. it was all fast food chains, no kidding. They were all on the same road, too, like maybe Johnny Fastfoodseed came through there in the 70's and just started throwing his seeds all around willy-nilly up and down that one street. So with that said, I wasn't the most cultured or adventurous food connessiuer. \\n\\nSo I had never had falafel. So I go through the motions that everyone goes through. \\"What's in it? Is it meat? Chick Peas, really? I've never had a chick pea. Is it good? They look crunchy. Are they crunchy?\\" Ben was like whatever, guy, just try it. So I took that great plunge and got my first falafel sandwich at Rami's. \\n\\nIt was so good! They even put cucumbers and pickles in there, and I ate them, when usually I would brush them off. I must have been in a super good mood. And the dood working there was super friendly (as everyone else has said) and loaded my sandwich up with a ton of falafels. The tahini was borderline addictive, and the last two bites, full of hummus and tahini and falafel were friggin amazing. And I eat fast and I don't swallow that much, so I've got this huge mouth full of pita and tahini and hummus and falafel and its all dripping down my face, which is contorted into that kind of face you make when you go \\"oh man this is so good\\". Go to Rami's and you'll know the face I'm talking about. \\n\\nSo after that, I was curious, and I tried all these other falafel joints in Boston, just to see what the deal was. And guess what, they all sucked. Ok, wait, they all sucked in comparison to Rami's. I even went into Rami's once and told the guy there that I had done that. He got kinda weirded out that I was comparing non-Isreali falafel to like.. greek falafel. But WTF do I know, I'm a kid from the sticks. I just like how it tastes. \\n\\nI'm giving out four stars on this one because in my golden days of Rami's dining, they used to put a lot more falafel into the sandwich than they do these days. But then again, everytime I go in there, there's like 3 families ordering and stuff, so they're probably busy. \\n\\nAnd oh yeah, don't try going on a Friday night, or at all on Saturday.

For the main course ordered pan fried Halibut.(7 oz).  Came with a jalapeno sauce.  I'm not big on very spicy, but read a revue that said it wasn't spicy.  Took a chance and sauce had a very nice flavor without being overpowering. Halibut was thick, moist and cooked perfectly.

We typically make the pilgrimage to Lockhart and head to Black's. \\n\\nBut one weekend, while heading to Zandunga, we passed a shack with a line out the door. A titanic, ridiculous line, spanning the length of the parking lot, in 95 degree heat. Franklin BBQ eh? Could this be the challenger that unseats Black's and saves us two hours of travel time on Sunday?\\n\\nA small group of us arrived at 10:30am, to what appeared to be a small line. Of course, we immediately began picking the brains of our fellow line denizens. Pork ribs, brisket, and bourbon banana pie, done! \\n\\nA Franklin employee starts coming down the line. Clearly shes here to take pre-orders, and help everyone through the line expeditiously. I mean, that's what common sense would dictate from a restaurant known for long lines. But no, shes here to find out what we want to order, but largely ignore it for the sake of knowing when they'll run out of meat. What kind of ass-backwards hillbilly planning is that? Seriously?\\n\\nAlright, well everyone has been hyping this BBQ as legendary, the wait will be worth it if that's the case. The doors  open at 11, and the line advances slightly. Then we wait. And wait. And wait. Once inside, it smells heavenly. We slowly creep up enough to view the chopping block. \\n\\nThe racks of ribs look so good they're downright pornographic. If you've ever wondered what the definition of \\"rib porn\\" is, watch them pull a rack of ribs out and unwrap it. Then add your own Barry White soundtrack in your mind. Time seemed to slow down slightly, and I was bouncing up and down slightly with excitement. \\n\\nThe fella taking our orders was genial and clever, clearly he enjoyed his job. The BBQ ran roughly $15/plate, pricey, but in the upper echelons of BBQ, you've got to pay to play. \\n\\nWas the first bite orgasmic? Absolute BBQ nirvana? Ehhhh, not really. It was good, really good. Subtly smokey, with the most amazing texture. Bones were easily plucked out of the meat, which was so well cooked that meat and fat seemed to blend together in harmony, yet it still contained that tensile strength that tells you, you aren't chewing on a blob of lard. \\n\\nI slather on some sauce in an attempt to kick it up a bit. The espresso BBQ sauce got rave reviews from the table, though I still preferred their classic, vinegar based sauce. It definitely improved the taste, combined with the sublime texture, and you've got a serious contender. \\n\\nThe brisket was equally moist, but largely tasteless despite have more rings than Saturn. Bonus points for the smokey beans, if only the brisket tasted like that! I hate to say it, but the bourbon banana pie was the star of the show. Amazing flaky crust, and a perfect palette cleanser.\\n\\nDid Franklin's steal the crown? Not quite. Had I never had Black's before, Franklin BBQ would be the best I've ever had. But factor in 30 minutes of drive time + an hour and a half wait, and it would have been slightly faster to drive to Lockhart.

It tasted like a sandwich that you'd buy from the freezer of your grocery store and then nuke in the microwave.  The fries were woefully undercooked, limp and cold without any crispiness to them at all.  I can usually eat just about anything but even I couldn't force down more than a couple of bites.

There are a few other places, but this is what would attract the average person from another neighborhood or even someone from OTP when they aren't at Wal Mart or some place.  It's a beautiful building; very colorful and adorned with lighting fixtures from Mexico; giant sculptures of sugar skulls and Mariachi bands, and lots of outdoor seating. It's kind of a destination restaurant as far as taking photos if you're into that kind of thing (but don't take photos inside the import store, they don't allow it.)  \\n\\nNot that this is a downside, but the menu itself isn't actually touristy.  Though I always picture a chain restaurant like Uncle Julio's or something having a more tourist style menu, where the food is never spicy and you just see the usual Tex-Mex.  However at the same time, it's not fancy either. It IS kind of Tex Mex because it's just tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, tamales, etc, however, they're made with fresh ingredients and their salsas and side dishes are better. But is it amazing? I guess it falls just a bit short of that.  This place is so big and colorful and unlike anywhere else that you would think there'd be a sort of gourmet Mexico City type of cuisine, but there's nothing like that.  In the mornings, the Adios Cafe is open for breakfast/brunch.  They have a really good coffee selection, all Mexican-style. I had the cafe de olla which had cocoa and cinnamon and it tasted great and was super strong.  On one hand, this is a pretty good alternative to getting brunch at any Sunday mid-morning place in intown Atlanta because most people are wanting the usual and may not think to get a Mexican style breakfast.  On the other hand, they're still doing a basic breakfast and just putting it in a tortilla , or adding salsa to eggs, or serving blue corn griddle cakes.  I've never been to Mexico but I hear the breakfasts are more like fresh fruit and a pastry, but I don't know.  The staff is nice and friendly there, too.

One is downstairs right next to the bar. That is where we sat, and it got pretty loud. There were groups of people standing around the bar, and some were really near the tables, so it will be loud. There is also another seating area in what looked like the mezzanine area, away from the bar. I would recommend sitting there if you don't want to have to shout.\\n\\n*The drinks*\\nThe cocktail menu is excellent here. They even had a winter special which was a egg nog with a layer of Bacardi 151 on top. They would set the 151 on fire in front of you, which was cool.\\n\\n*The food*\\n-Spanish cheeses: these came with grilled bread which was excellent. I thought that it was a little weird that nobody explained what kind of cheese we were being served. The menu simply said assorted cheeses, and the person who served us the cheese dropped it off and walked away. Luckily the cheese was delicious.\\n-Fried calamari: this was the bomb. The calamari pieces were lightly fried, with delicious sauce.\\n-Paella: this was a disappointment. It was more like claypot rice with seafood on top. IT wasn't even served in a paella pan, it seemed to have been cooked in a claypot and even had the burnt edges of claypot rice. Maybe it was more \\"creative\\"?

I went with a veggie burger and the fries & 'shrooms, while the wife went with a dozen wings and chili fries.\\n\\nFirst off, Ellis is super friendly and loves to talk about his craft, which is really up my wife's alley, chef that she is. The veggie burger was really delicious, not of the soy variety, but a nice hearty patty of goodness topped with avocado. I was asked if I had anything against carrots, which I do not, so I had a good amount topping the burger, because, as Ellis put it, \\"I dunno, I got a thing for the color orange lately.\\"\\n\\nThe fries are spectacular, a nicely seasoned batch of potato wedges. The 'shrooms, while nice, didn't add too much to the mix. He also gave me a batch of what he called \\"420 Sauce\\", which was a green dipping sauce for my fries. It reminded me a bit of a thinner-consistency guacamole, very good indeed.\\n\\nThe chili used for the fries my wife got was very, very nice. Even as a vegetarian, I'm not morally opposed to having meat once in a blue moon, which had to be my attitude with these fries, as the chili had nice chunks of pulled pork and just the right amount of spiciness. I was even talked into having a wing, which are ever-so-slightly breaded, enough to make them crispy but not enough that you're fighting through a shell to get to the meat, a la Hooters.\\n\\nOverall, it's nice to find yet another great spot for soul food in this town.

The second time, after they just cranked up the brand new smoker, I went back. This was during ACL weekend on Friday. I made it in line about 11:30 and had my food shortly after 1. It seems from reading others' reviews on here that the line time is only getting longer despite the new piece of equipment.\\n\\nTHE BEEF BRISKET-The brisket is the absolute best beef brisket I have ever had in my entire life. I always ask for the sliced fatty brisket. The second I took my first bite, I was hooked. Nice black crust formed on the outside of the meat, giving it a punch of flavor from what tastes like an espresso based rub. It's good with the espresso sauce. (This guy is an espresso nut! What do you expect from a guy that wakes up at 3 am everyday?) But, it's best with no sauce at all! And best of all, it's very smoky, and you can totally taste that oak wood. And the fatty brisket here is significantly better than the lean, because the fat is so well rendered into the meat. \\n\\nTHE PULLED PORK-Aaron impressed me with the pork as well. There are some pieces of crust present throughout as well as a moistness that is unachievable by most 'que places in Texas, and even most Memphians can't get it down either. I am from Memphis originally, so I am always seeking out good pulled pork in Texas. Eating pulled pork with a little bit of sauce is usually a habit, but Aaron's pork does not require sauce! It is by far the best in the state of Texas, and right behind three others in Tennessee and Carolina. \\n\\nTHE RIBS-The ribs are pretty flavorful and near solid red from the smokiness. They are very good, but they are lean and meaty. The smoke is there, but needs a little bit of flavor added from some fat, which was not present. If for some reason you can't handle some flavorful fatty goodness even though you're standing in a barbecue place, the then ribs are a good option (they also have turkey, which I haven't tried)\\n\\nTHE SIDES-I wish they had a little more side selection. I know with the popularity of this place they're probably not thinking about new sides anytime soon. The slaw is great. The potato salad is good, but it's a standard yellow with Russet spuds just like typical places in Memphis have. I usually prefer a red potato salad with a mayonnaise base. The beans are borracho beans--not a fan.\\n\\nTHE DRINKS-Yes, I am writing about their drink selection, too! They normally feature Maine Root beverages, refillable from the fountain. And this includes Prickly Pear Lemonade and Blueberry Root Beer. I don't like Texas water, so it was refreshing to see some better drink options that didn't include Coke or Pepsi.\\n\\n\\nI would deduct a star for the per pound meat prices, but you can easily alleviate that by ordering a 2 meat combo plate. The 2 meat plate is definitely the best deal around! If you're craving more variety, just add on from there.\\n\\nOverall, the best barbecue place in Texas, and one of my all time favorites in the states!

Well worth the wait!"},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Brunch review only:\\n\\nMy party of 7 and I came into Masa on a Saturday at about 11am.  We didn't have reservations.  Make reservations!!! Especially if you want to sit in the main dining room.  Since we didn't have reservations, we were told that it'd be at least a 45 minute wait, but we could dine at the bar, which was full service.  We opted for the bar.  It was tricky to get all 7 of us at first, but a super nice lone dinner graciously moved over 2 seats for us. thanks!\\n\\nFor $7.95, you can select a first choose meal of the choices: banana empanada (best choice hands down per our server), granola con leche, or some thing else... fruit maybe?\\n\\nSecond choose was a choice of like 4 options, which i can't remember other than their version of eggs Benedict, huevos rancheros, or scrambled eggs of some sort.  I got the huevos rancheros, which was tasty for the most part- a little on the salty side for me, but I'm not a salt type of person. They start off with a plate of crushed black beans then top it with fluffy (home made tasting), chewy, and soft tortillas, 2 eggs sunny side up and yolk tastefully runny, then added a dollop of cotija cheese (theirs is a cheesy sour cream instead of crumbled or grated) and salsa.  Other than it being a tad too salty... It was still good, and I still managed to scarf it down (lady like, of course ;p ) even though I knew I'd be totally stuffed! They also give you the option of tea or coffee with free refills. Our server didn't let my friend get decaf tea (Lipton decaf too!), saying it'd be a regular charge. Boo to that.\\n\\nService was ok at best, considering how busy the establishment was and the size of the bar and our party (pretty small- prob can hold up to 11 at the actual bars counter top). We sat there numerous times with empty glasses.. They usually bring out their delicious corn bread (try their blue corn bread-yum!) Right after you order or even before some times, but our server was lacking bc we got it waaaaaay after (literally right before our first course).\\n\\nOverall, it was pleasant, I'd definitely come again for brunch.  I'd like to try their tapas one day too.  They have happy hour on them!!  After 4pm on Thursday, their tapas is $0.50 all night!  I love cheap, yummy food at nice ish places. haha I'll be seeing you again, Masa!"},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I found this place after a friend recommended it.  Apparently it's still in the \\"beta\\" stage of being a bar, but from what I could tell it's got a lot of promise.\\n\\nTo start off like some others said the name is a bit of a mouthful, I have a feeling people will just call it \\"Cypress Street\\" or some other nickname.\\n\\nThe feel is a total neighborhood bar, with a porch out front for the summer.  It's tucked away between several condo/apartment developments, and you get the idea those residents are going to be the main patrons.\\n\\nInside the wood motif is comfortable, though the lighting is dark for even a bar.  I don't expect sterile office lighting a bar, but I'd like to see more of Some one than just their eyes and teeth.\\n\\nIn general Cypress Street has a lot of potential, and I will certainly go back to check out their full menu.

The parking lot got pretty full as soon as it opened but we were lucky to be one of the first ones in.  They are very efficient about getting people in and out quickly.  \\n\\nAs for the food, I ordered the Haystack Benedict which was a garlic rosemary biscuit w/bacon, egg, hashbrown casserole and hollandaise.  This was so freaking delicious but heavy.  My husband ordered the Cornbread Waffle with ginger pulled pork.  His was flavorful but the cornbread waffle got soggy very quickly.  Not something we'd order again.  We also enjoyed the Nutella Turbo which is cold brew with Nutella and condensed milk.

My husband got really good Mac and cheese but does not make up the raw fish. Will not be back. \\n\\nThe longer version is that my husband and I went to Wild Horse on a whim. We were seated at a nice table and I had a nice glass of wine. We started with the poutine and it was really good. The gravy was the best part. \\nOur food came out and my husband's was pretty good. I stuck my form into the fish and took a bite. It didn't flake as it normally should for a white fish. I thought it was raw and asked my husband - a former chef - if I was crazy. He said that it was in fact completely raw and everything on the plate wasn't edible. The waiter came over and asked if I wanted something else. After eating raw fish, no, I didn't. I totally lost my appetite. But my husband told me to get something because he knew I would be hungry later. The waiter recommended the ravioli and I said fine. The ravioli came out about 5 minutes later and it was pretty flavorless. The Raviolis were mushy and I do not even know what was in them. Cheese or what? The sauce was flavorless and it was just a mushy mess. I had two Raviolis and gave up. \\nThey boxed it up and I just left it at the table. No thanks.\\nWe won't be back. For spending $65 on a meal it wasn't worth it at all. \\nLastly, the part that bothered me most was that the manager did not come over to apologize. They did not take anything off the bill (I truly didn't expect that) but it seems like standard procedure that the manager would be sent over to acknowledge that in this instance they missed the mark. That's the classy thing to do. That's what gets people to come after a bad experience.

Sat at a table, didn't see a waitress for 20 mins.  No big deal.  We just went to the bar to get our own drinks.  Minutes later, the waitress swings by surrounding tables asking them if they were doing ok, if they needed anything.  I was like WTF? I tried getting the waitress's attention so that I could question her about the service.  She of course avoided eye contact with me like the plague. I finally got her attention on her 3 rd pass by our table and asked her if she was the only waitress working.  She said yes.  Then I asked if there was a reason why, during our hour plus there, she never once came to our table.  She said it was because she assumed we got our drinks at the bar.  I mean I guess that seems fair but when I was a cocktail waitress, I still asked customers if they were doing ok just in case they in fact closed out those tabs at the bar.  It is called customer service and Lil Woodrow's should consider learning about it.  I don't think I'll be back to this location.

Not so good as the fatty brisket but still worth trying at least once!\\n\\nPulled pork: Really really good! Love the salty bits and you don't even need the bbq sauce. I've had lots of pulled pork but nothing compared to this. Maybe you can find in other parts of the  South but I've never experienced anything close.\\n\\nSausage: really good.\\n\\nTurkey: really good! Compared to any other smoked turkey it's worth it.

Much better than Salt Lick or John Muellers. The pork ribs - the meat literally fell off the bone when i picked it up. Definitely one of the best ive ever had. The pulled pork had dry parts and very moist parts. The moist parts were the most tender pulled pork i've eaten ever. Their turkey was uneventful and I actually disliked the sausage.

I really enjoyed this during the first few bites but after a while, it became harder to have more of, especially as the broth gets cooler. It just became too heavy and I was looking for a way to find a balance or take a break with sips of beer and water. Ultimately, I would still order this again but I think this would be a great thing to share.\\n\\nI also loved the Brussels Sprouts here. I had never had it prepared, or even considered this method, anywhere else. If you're familiar with Chinese cuisine, the sauce used was very similar to the sweet, slightly vinegary sticky sauce used in Peking Spareribs. But what was great about this was that the brussels sprouts were still very crisp and not soggy from the sauce."},{"name":"La Mezcaleria","address":"1622 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"It is always a long wait to get a seat for dinner but the queso fundido is worth it!

It is right down the street from my house, and that means a lot.  It doesn't preclude I will go there, however.  What does is their lovely selection of beers on tap.  All my favorites and then some:  Blue Moon, Stella Artois, Bass, Dos Equis, Fireman's 4, etc.  There is ample outdoor patio space, so you are almost guaranteed a seat.  Don't shy away in the winter, this location has the trademark fire pit to keep your tootsies warm.  You would think that keeping the large garage doors open would prevent the patrons from having a safe haven from the oppressive heat in the summer.  Instead, they have created a breezeway by having patios w/huge garage doors on both sides of the building.  This draws the air right through and makes for a pleasant experience inside.  There are washers in the back for those who like a good bar activity.  No pool tables.  You can rest assured your sports fancy will be tickled at one of the numerous large and small screens situated in all viewing areas.  Even if you have to sit outside, you have a decent view of the larger screens.  it does get packed during UT football games, so get there early if you want to sit inside.  \\n\\nI have mentioned I will always return to this location, but I need to explain why none of my close friends will, which also explains the 3 stars.  There have been numerous occasions when a hand full of waitresses were working tables and never once asked if we needed anything.  Our beers were clearly empty, our pockets clearly full, our table clearly ignored.  Numerous occasions.  We decided they are not assigned particular tables and it causes confusion for the waitresses.  Either that or they thought we had a tab at the bar, so they would not get tipped.  In this case, the chicken came first.  We were going to bar to get service because we weren't getting it from a waitress.  This was not our preference.  On one particular occasion in the recent past, I recall my friend waiving down a waitress and asking for a menu.  She never brought the menu and never asked if we needed anything and never asked another waitress to assist us.  We bought food at the Thai place down the way and brought it back to the table in protest.  It's funny, though; I am sure no one even noticed.   On another occasion, we sat outside and flagged a waitress every time we needed a beer.  We ordered a pizza during another flag and had to go up to the bar to check on it after 45 minutes.  No order was placed.  They need a new system. \\n\\nPerfect beer selection, decent food, cool space, horrendous service, three stars."},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I like Black Fire. They provide a wide variety of meats, most of which were good. They also provided a very decent salad bar and some other hot items on the salad bar such as white and yellow rice, lasagna , Beef with black beans. \\n\\nEven better was the price,which was only $41 per person,which is a LOT less than other top steakhouses. For example, Fogo de Chao,which is the gold standard for Brazilian Steak houses charges upwards of $75 per person. Mortons, which is another top notch steak house, is also very costly. Rarely will people get out of there for less than $60 per person.\\n\\nEven better, they were able to personalize the meal for us. For example, they serve chicken breast and some steak wrapped in bacon ,which I don't like. Thus, they make the same items for me without the bacon.\\n\\nLikewise, I want some more well done filet mignon while my family wanted some filet much less well done. They were able to accommodate all of us,which was a wonderful touch.\\n\\nThey also had very nice decor and plenty of parking. So why didn't I give it 5 stars?\\n\\nThe problem is that most of the meat was fatty! They definitely didn't have the same quality of meat that Fogo de Chao or Mortons would have. However, it wasn't bad at all, and I do recommend it. They do have offerings that are lean and very tasty. I just wish they bought better cuts of their meats.\\n\\nBottom line: if you are in the mood for steak and want to get access to many different types of meats and cuts of meat with a very good salad bar at a very good price, this is the place for you. If you want top quality cuts that only the best restaurants serve, you should go elsewhere. However, it will cost you at least 50% more for almost the same quality.\\n\\nI should note that this is a heck of a lot better than what we were charged at Disneyworld for  a good meal. We had steak that the Disney Japanese steak house that was at least $45 per person and provided a LOT less in quantity than what we had here."},{"name":"The Squealing Pig","address":"134 Smith St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place to escape from medical-center hell.

The chicken-fried rabbit was decent - a terrine of rabbit is breaded and deep fried.  Not what I expected, but good.  \\nThe striped bass crudo was a waste of fish.  Two thin slices of fish covered in peanuts and a few dabs of sauce - all you tasted was the peanuts.  $16.

Kevin Gillespie and team have conceptualized and executed a well-thought out restaurant. The beverages were complex in flavor and delicious. The food was also very good, although bordering on too salty. I think the restaurant is great for the area, but it would take a lot to get me from the Westside back to Revival when I have JCT Kitchen just around the corner.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\n\\nSitting in Revival makes you think that you are actually in your grandmother's house on a Sunday evening. There is just enough kitsch scattered about to not overwhelm the senses. The restaurant really strikes a nice balance here and I think that the design of this place is top notch. We sat in a small room behind the hostess stand and I actually felt this room was somewhat neglected in the decorating department. One extreme negative that really seems to bug me more and more is how incredibly loud the restaurant is. WHY ARE PEOPLE SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER? This place could benefit from a few sound dampening panels or foam underneath the tables. Am I having dinner or am I at a Def Leopard concert?\\n\\nBEVERAGE\\n\\nThe cocktail menu is definitely interesting - there are a couple of punch-style options as well as a full drink menu. I had the Hurricane Punch and it was really good - it had passion fruit listed as ingredient so I was immediately on board. One of my dining compatriots had their take on the Boulevardier made with scotch and it really packed quite the alcoholic punch.\\n\\nAlthough I did not have the beverage, the Toasted Old Fashioned from Meredith's alcohol cart from Gunshow makes its appearance on the regular beverage menu at Revival. This really is a great version of the Old Fashioned and I highly recommend trying it if you're a fan.\\n\\nOne beverage-related complaint is that I ordered a decaffeinated coffee at the end of the meal to accompany dessert, but it never came. Our server noted its absence as we were finishing dessert and apologized. While I would have rather enjoyed my coffee with dessert, I am glad that she acknowledged that it never came.\\n\\nFOOD\\n\\nYou're basically presented with two dining options: (1) Family-style where you choose your entr√©e and everything else is basically chosen for you and sized proportionate to the number of diners at your table OR (2) A la carte. Given the number of actual menu items (e.g., limited menu) - I don't see the real benefit in choosing the family-style unless you wanted to try everything. One benefit I would see is that the side dishes are sized proportionately to the number of diners where as if you choose to dine a la carte, they were JUST right for four diners - although bordering on too small.\\n\\nThe food definitely reminded me of Sunday dinner sitting around my grandmother's table. It is a nifty concept and the execution is spot on. My only real complaint would be that the fried chicken was bordering on being too salty. I believe the chicken is brined before it goes through the frying process and a lot of sodium is imparted into the meat. Beyond that, there's not much else to complain about.\\n\\nSERVICE\\n\\nWe had an extremely amicable server named Felicia. She was super energetic and attentive throughout the course of our meal. Word to the wise, do not say \\"Bye, Felicia\\" as you are leaving.

The flavouring for the fish is very good, but the cold bok choy threw me off.\\n- shortrib lettuce wrap: a winner of the night. The braised shortribs came shredded up, juicy and full of flavour. The lettuce wrapping was fun, and the full combination of the beef, lotus root, crispy egg noodles, and the hot sauce is a match made in heaven!\\n- kakuni and scallop: this fell a bit flat for me, since the total portions on the plate were significantly smaller than expected. Three quarter-sized pieces of pork belly for two scallops was pretty hard to split up.

We ordered all four meat options: pulled pork, sausage, brisket, and ribs. All of them were amazing and I say go for it!!! Definitely order more brisket than you think you want.

It was a beautiful day so we, along with everyone else, opted to sit outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to be greeted with no apology from the waitress.  I understand she was getting tables faster than anticipated but a busy server should always stop at a table to apologize for the slow service and promise to be over ASAP.  They have a small selection of local beers which were great.  After another long wait (we were finally able to put our order in 40 minutes after being seated), our food arrived and looked fabulous!  I ordered the Roasted Mushroom Pizza which was loaded with mushrooms and gorgonzola, I could only finished half of the meal but it made great leftovers!  Others at my table had the Chicken Pesto Pizza (good), Three Little Pigs (he loved it!) and the Bratwurst Burger (so-so).  All of the meals were very high in calories, but worth it for a special occasion.  We had the Banana Pudding for dessert which was too big for four people to share.  It was decent but nothing better than what I could make at home.\\n\\nOverall a good experience with a great ambiance (I loved watching the kids play in the fountain).  The closest parking was 10$ and I heard you could find cheaper parking but this was the most convenient.  The wait staff was friendly but inexperienced.

I don't know what they put in it but it's really heavenly.

I have to preface my answer. Franklin Barbecue is my answer, but I am hesitant because of the long wait/line. My first review on my blog was on Franklin, and you can find it here. It has been a long time since I stood in line at Franklin. It has been over two years. I have had it at festivals and through pre-orders since then. Pre-ordering is the way to go. You sign up online about a month ahead; order over five pounds of meat, and walk up and pick up your delicious meat without waiting in line. You cannot eat the food there though.\\n\\nAmber and I took the day off so we can wait in line at Franklin. We got there around 9:15 AM and were about 50 people back. I was surprised the line was so long on a Tuesday. When the staff came around gauging how much food everyone was ordering, they informed us there will probably not be any pork ribs left for us. I was bummed. They came back later and said there will be some because a pre-order had cancelled. Yes! We had some friends meat us at various points while we are waiting. The time moved a lot quicker than the last time I waited. We got to the door around 12:15. We finally arrived at the counter at 12:45 PM. \\n\\nThere were five of us so I wanted to make sure no one was hungry after we left Franklin. I ordered three pounds of moist brisket, a pound of pork ribs, half pound of pulled pork and turkey, and three links of sausage. I got carried away and might have ordered too much. Is that possible at Franklin? The only meat that was missing was beef ribs. It is only a Saturday special, and you will not catch me in the longest line of the week. Five hours or more? Nope.\\n\\nOne bite into the brisket and I was transported to that magical place. It has to be one of the best things I have ever bought into my mouth. The explosion of flavor that came from the bark was delightful. The meat was so tender and smoky. The rendering of the fat was on point. I could live solely off this brisket. I could not stop eating it. The pork ribs were delicious. The meat could barely stay on the bone. The rub and smoke meddle together forming a deep flavor with every bite. We typically forget about pork butt in Texas. Aaron however did a great job with the pulled pork. It had a nice balance of moisture, rub, and smoke. I am not a fan of turkey normally, but the slice I had was fantastic. It was juicy and flavorful. I did wish for a little bit more smoke. I enjoy their sausage, but I wish they made it in-house. Besides the line, this is their only other flaw. Not bad flaws to have if you can call them flaws. The sausage is made to their specification by Texas Sausage Co. The grit and snap were ideal. It had a great taste from the pepper and garlic blend. Everything was excellent that I forgot about their three sauces. You can even buy their sauces from HEB now.\\n\\nWe got a tour of the new smokehouse. Franklin Barbecue was closed for a couple of weeks this summer to build it. With the new smokehouse, the weather elements will not affect the smoking process as much which allows for shorter and better cook times. The added on structure now houses fives offset smokers and a rotisserie smoker for ribs.\\n\\nSometimes it is hard to put your opinions into words or on paper. My friend Rob that night said it best, \\"I did not eat dinner because I didn't want the taste of Franklin Barbecue to leave my mouth.\\" True. What I do not get is how some people think Franklin is overhyped. Have they tried their meat? They like their BBQ covered in sauce? Sure there is wait, but the prize at the end of the tunnel is superb 'cue. If they do not think this is good barbecue, they might want to get their taste buds checked out.

I live so close and have tried to come a couple of times, but I primarily dine with vegetarians and vegans, so this spot has never been on the top of everyone's list. But today my non-vegan sister was in town for brunch and there was no question. We were going! \\n\\nThere was a line out the door on Saturday at 10am, but I expected it so it didn't bother me. The line didn't move particularly fast, but it wasn't an insanely long wait. They are moving to a new location later this year, but their current floor plan is pretty small. 6 or so tables inside and a couple of tables on the patio. I got a little bit of seat anxiety while waiting in line, but there were two booth seats open by the time we ordered. They have a process with the line and getting a table (no saving tables while you're in line) and it seems to be working for them until they get to their larger location. \\n\\nI struggled to pick my favorite thing on the menu, but I knew I wanted one of those biscuits. I ordered the 7 Bowl of Nonsense off the specials menu and my sister got one of their classic dishes with eggs, bacon, a biscuit, and grits. The food was outstanding. Really nice presentation and and seemed very similar to something I would receive at a trendy, southern brunch spot in ATL. My meal was SO GOOD. Roasted potatoes, sausage gravy, pimento cheese spread, eggs over medium, and a biscuit. Ridiculous. The biscuit was so perfect. Huge, soft, fluffy, flaky, everything a biscuit should be. The perfect thing to sop up all of the gravy, pimento, and egg yolk. Ri-dic-u-lous. The winner on sister's plate was THE GRITS. Creamy, cheesey, garlicky goodness. Must try. \\n\\nService was decent as well. Everything is relatively self-serve (order at the counter, find your own table, get your own drink), but they do clean up the table afterwards. We didn't interact with any staff with the exception of ordering and didn't have any issues. \\n\\nSe7en Bites is a must try for the Orlando brunch crowd. It's no where close to healthy (the bar stools sit in front of the ladies baking- hello butter, Crisco, and sugar!), but that's not why you're choosing this spot for brunch. Get a biscuit and get the grits!

Are you sure you wouldn't want a cocktail? Glass of wine? Iced tea? If you ask for one dessert, be prepared to be asked if you wouldn't prefer two. There's a reason these restaurants run solidly in the black.\\n\\n2. For the money you pay, you get some very average food. Canned corn on some catfish is the sort of item most restaurants would price out reasonably around 12 dollars, with sides. You simply aren't getting a good value. At every turn, the restaurant seems to skimp. Fried chicken with few spices, but slathered in butter. She-crab soup the consistency of half-and-half, with little in the way of crab. \\n\\nOverall, if you're looking to spend money and enjoy some nice atmosphere, South City Kitchen delivers.

We made sure to stop in during our recent trip to Portland, since I haven't had much Southern food in my life and wanted my introduction to the cuisine to be at a great place. We came on the 4th, thinking that people would be at cookouts and whatnot, but the place was still hopping! That's a true testament to how much people love this restaurant--or maybe they were all just celebrating America by eating the most American food possible! Thankfully we did not have to wait too long, and I definitely noticed that despite the crowd, the hosts and servers seemed super on top of it. \\n\\nWe got iced tea, sweet tea, fried okra, brisket with cole slaw and baked beans, and a side of mac and cheese. In a surprise touch of Southern hospitality, our server never let our tea glasses go to empty, and we were not about to argue with that! The fried okra was very good, and goes very well with the sauce accompanying it. The mac and cheese is about as indulgent as you can imagine it: covered in melted cheese and smothered in buttery, creamy sauce. The star of our meal, though, was definitely the brisket plate. The cole slaw was delicious, the baked beans were the best I've ever had, and the huge hunk of brisket (10 oz!!) was so tender it just fell apart at the touch of my fork. I will say I was confused by the huge mass of crispy fried onion strips on top--I liked them, but there was just so much of it--but the whole experience was a party for my taste buds.\\n\\nBy the way, I thought I had an impressive appetite before I ate here--I was wrong. If you think you can eat a lot, prepare to be humbled by Screen Door. I only got through half of my meal and half of our sides before I had to call it, but hey, that means awesome lunch for the day after!\\nSo Screen Door definitely delivers: great hospitality, great food, and great atmosphere."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ummmmmmmmmmmm............Can you say UHMAZING?

The place is small but cozy, and I cannot recommend going to the bathroom enough. It's a weird recommendation, but when you get there you'll understand. The walls are a work of art, and the paper towel dispenser is very cleverly implemented. I found myself taking pictures of the bathroom while there. The staff is friendly and welcoming. They came over twice to check on us which is impressive considering how busy they were due to the pending line still in the doorway.\\n\\nI had the #2 tonkotsu sho-yu which I feel was overly salty. Even though it was soy based and therefore supposed to be a stronger taste than say the #1 tonkotsu, I found myself grabbing my water every few bites. In the end I finished all the noodles but left the broth mostly untouched. The noodles have a unique texture, and went down fast. The piece of pork that was included was heavenly. It was tender and fatty and complimented the taste of the ramen perfectly. The soft boiled egg had a consistency that pleased my taste buds (I came here knowing my love for soft boiled egg so I got an extra one for a buck fifty. This egg did not disappoint). I also added naruto maki which was chewy and a nice addition to the whole picture.

Fortunately, I noticed a  single table opening up out of the corner of my eye and requested to sit there - hostess happily obliged. \\n\\nFood:\\nThe menu is pretty basic, with what honestly feels like, some higher-end, slightly too pricey bar food. \\nPita bread triangles as an appetizer were really good, except for the fact that we had to point out that one of them had been essentially totally unbaked and was still completely dough. \\n\\nI had the chicken and waffles, and although it's definitely a smaller portion size, the flavor was awesome. My wife went with the Porter Burger that was really good......until she got to the center where she got into again...cold, uncooked, totally raw meet.\\n\\nWe are not the types to complain about food, but I had to say something about two of our meals having food that was not just undercooked, but essentially uncooked. The waiter was totally understanding and apologetic. One of the owners even came out and again apologized and even comped both the burger and appetizer for us. Really a cool guy, all of the staff seemed great and striving to please. I cringe when having to complain about our meals, but we honestly looked at it as trying to help Porter work out some of the apparent kinks in their process back in the kitchen.\\n\\nWe'll definitely try again, but we had what I would consider some new restaurant hiccups that were pretty significant."},{"name":"Maraya At Sabrina's Restaurant","address":"8100 Crystal Clear Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"It looks like nothing on the outside and is a bit hidden away.

The rabbit had barely a hare of rabbit, and doughy dumplings that went uneaten. Another drink was so thick and rich that a shot-glass size would've been welcomed, and one, though scrumptious, tasted like it contained one 1/4 thimble of gin. You get the idea.\\n\\nHere's the kicker: the hyped-as-hell special secret uberburger doesn't even come close to haunting my reverie. Turning melty cheese into a chewy cheese coaster is novel, but it didn't improve the consumption experience. It unproved it. Deproved it. What I'm saying is, I took off the cheese coaster.\\n\\nWould I recommend A&H? If you're prepared for an evening of edible wheel of fortune, sure. You might come out on top. Just don't hold your breath for the secret burger. If you pass out waiting, when you come to, the burger in front of you won't be that exciting."},{"name":"Courtyard Portland Downtown - Convention Center","address":"435 NE Wasco St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Spent Memorial Day Weekend here with friends from Seattle.

We showed up during off-hours, well after the dinner rush on a very rainy Saturday evening. The restaurant was mostly empty, and we were the only ones waiting, yet it still took several minutes to be seated.\\n\\nPretty simple menu -- four burgers (IIRC), and a couple of options as far as fries go. I went with the house burger and fries. The toppings were mostly awesome -- a heaping scoop of caramelized onions and a slice of medium cheddar. I was disappointed to find leaves of iceberg lettuce, however. I don't know -- I guess I'm expecting green or red leaf if I'm eating a better burger. \\n\\nBut was it a better burger? For such a supposedly fancy burger, it was remarkably pedestrian flavor-wise. It wasn't bad, but I figured it'd be knock-it-out-of-the-park awesome. And it most certainly wasn't. The meat was cooked nicely to a medium, but it just tasted unseasoned and essentially bland.\\n\\nSpeaking of bland ... the fries ... hand cut, and crispy, but totally plain otherwise.

I don't live far from Rodeo, and had passed it many times.  Finally I decided to give it a try.  I was pleased with what I found.\\n\\nI was sat down, and offered chips and cornbread.  The cornbread sounded enticing, but I needed to try the chips and salsa for a decent review.  Of course, I asked for them to bring their hottest salsa to check that out.  The chips were tasty, and fresh.  The salsa actually had a decent kick to it, that I would think many people would find too hot, so that was a good start.  They also gave me a dish of pico that was tasty and had a good tomato flavor.  I also ordered a couple of beers to go along with my meal.\\n\\nThe menu had a good variety with plenty of the typical fare on there, burritos, tacos, enchilada, and such.  I decided to go with one of the meals and ordered the Molcajete (strips of beef or chicken served over a bed of rice in a special sauce with cheese and cilantro, served with beans and two flour tortillas). I got the beef.  The food came out pretty quickly, and had a nice presentation.  The black beans were tasty, and the carne asade served over the rice was outstanding. The tortillas were slightly crispy yet chewy, so no complaints there.  My big disappointment was with the rice.  Normally, I wouldn't ding something like that so much, but as the bed for my meat, I was not so happy with it.  It was okay, but tasted and felt to me like bagged Uncle Ben's rice (which is too similar to the bagged rice I used to barely stomach out of MREs).  I am not sure if it was just the way they prepared or if it was just pre-cooked, bagged rice.  Either way, I didn't care for it.

So that was already a good start.\\n\\nIn our party we had the hubs, our 17 year old daughter, our 5 year old picky eater, and myself, the food lover.\\n\\nIt was so hard trying to choose what I wanted because everything looked so good so I opted for their Screen Door plate where you can choose 3 side dishes and it comes with cornbread. The 17 yo got the same, but different sides.  5 year old went with mac and cheese (kids version with no toppings) and hubs had the Brisket.\\n\\nMy food.  \\nI choose the catfish, collard greens, and brussel sprouts dish off the Local sides that came with cornbread.  The catfish was juicy but crispy and I loved the corn meal crust.  It was so tasty, juicy and perfectly fried and came with their own remoulade sauce.  The Brussel sprouts, although not really Southern, was a flavor explosion in my mouth.  They were so good I could've eaten an entire bowl of just those.  They had bits of tart blue cheese and sweet currants (I think they were currants) and they were so good, from the looks of the local menu, I think their Veggie sides are where it's at!!!  Trust me on this.  The Collard greens that came in comparison were rather plain and standard fare.  I have had amazing greens but these were not bad, just not worth it.  Next time I will order a different side. My cornbread was so good.  Here...they killed it.  It wasn't too sweet like some places and you can tell they used corn meal to make it.  I loved it.  This is a must.\\n\\nThe 17yo is not very adventurous with her foods yet.\\nFor her sides she had french fries, chicken and sausage gumbo, and mac and cheese.  The only thing worth noting was the mac and cheese and that is to say If you like Velveeta mac and cheese then you will love this as it has that same consistency and taste, but it was way too gooey and rich for us.  It was like eating cheese sauce with some macaroni in it.  The sauce drowned out the macaroni.\\n\\nHubs liked his House Smoked Brisket.

Weather was great, pulled out our lawn chairs and waited with the other couple hundred people that already were in line before us. We enjoyed hanging with our friends for the first 4 - 4 1/2 hours. After that it was a bit much. Especially when we finally reached the interior with a view of how completely inefficient their operation is. The operation manager in me wanted to jump in and make things better. But I put my weekend hat on and chilled out. The inefficiency is probably what keeps the appeal. Makes it seem exclusive when in all reality they are just making people wait when there are free tables and the ability to feed people faster. It seems to be a part of the strategy and clearly its working because hundreds of people wait in line daily. \\n\\nFinally after 6 hours we made it to the counter. It was fun deciding just what to pick after 6 hours of anticipation. We chose a 1.7 pound beef rib (yes, just one weighed almost 2 pounds!), pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey, potato salad, slaw and key lime pie. Oh and a couple of jalape√±os for good measure. \\n\\nFinally the moment of truth.... The beef rib was outstanding! It was literally melt in your mouth. Everything else was also delicious. Only thing I disliked was that all of the meat was a little too salty. Everyone in our group agreed. And normally I love salt on my food, it was just a little overwhelming. After a few bites of each thing we threw in the towel. Meat overload is not a good feeling. I think we spent a whole 15 minutes eating and then we're on our way as we're most of the others around us.

It was friday night and fairly busy but two seats opened up as soon as we walked in. We sat down and were greeted almost immediately by a very busy young bartender. They really have their work cut out for them at this bar. All the juices are squeezed as needed for the individual drinks. All manner of ingredients are being muddled, shook up, and chilled right before your eyes. These bartenders take it in stride and seem to enjoy making all these rather complicated drinks. I ordered a beer and my girlfriend ordered a Basil Grape refresher. One of those involved drinks. It tasted and looked great. We ordered some things from the happy hour menu and the regular dinner menu. From the happy hour we got spinach artichoke dip. A rich and cheesy dip with Parmesan shaved on top. It came with a cool metal bucket filled with warm tortilla chips. Very good, especially for my vegetarian girlfriend. I ordered buffalo wings and cold crawfish. The \\"wings\\" were actually all drumsticks and they were huge and numbered at six or eight. They came coated with hot sauce. Served with celery and carrots and blue cheese dressing. This plate was a good meal by itself, no doubt about this. The crawfish came cold on a plate with crackers and dill havarti cheese slices and cocktail sauce. There must have been a dozen of them gracing this dish. They tasted wonderful with the cocktail sauce. It also important to remember that these items were ordered from their happy hour and menu and they cost but three or four dollars each. I am always hesitant to mention price on Yelp. This is a great deal designed to offer some inexpensive food to go with your drinks. I do believe this menu should be ordered from only as something to go with a few (at least) cocktails or beers. Otherwise it is a bit of a waste of time for the staff of the bar and kitchen. My darling also ordered the hummus plate that was very large with warm pita, tomato and cucumbers.  I also splurged on the dungeness crab LEG cocktail of the dinner menu. It was awesome, simple as that. Approixmately ten leg segments removed from the shell. It was served with a bowl of cocktail sauce and some extra horseradish. I asked the bartender for some drawn butter and he happily obliged. It was really great. I had a few Rogue Dead Guys. My gal had a few of these really creative cocktails. We both had a bunch of great food, and enjoyed the lively but not too crowded environment. The bar is a cool part of Portland history and shows it well. The staff is great and fits the bar.

I used to frequent many great places in my old neighborhood such as Momofuko Noodle Bar, Ippudo and Ramen Setagaya.  I was happy to learn that a dedicated ramen shop was opening in Austin.  Could this place bring me back to my long lost ramen eating ways of the past?  Ramen Tatsu-ya did not disappoint.  I went on a Friday at 8:00pm.  Unsurprisingly there was a line out the door.  Surprisingly, the line moved fast!  Truly impressive for such a place considering it's popularity.  The atmosphere is casual and buzzing with a large communal table in the middle of the restaurant.  The music is even better and it makes this place really vibe.  Between that and the friendly staff, this place is spot on for Austin.  They offer refreshments while you wait in line which is a nice change and amazing considering how busy they are.  They have a good beer selection with classics like Asahi, Kirin and a bonus assortment of local brews (Austin Beerworks).  I ordered the original Tonkosu with a corn-bomb and extra egg.  After my order at the counter I was escorted to the communal table which I personally love.  It's a lot more fun and easy way to make new friends.  The food came out fast.  Score.  The broth was nice and creamy, and loaded up with pork belly, egg, wood ear mushroom and scallions.  The corn-bomb on the side was another nice addition to throw in as much or little as you like.  I also order the Munchie Katsu Slider, which I had no idea what this was.  Do yourself a favor and get this slider.  It's panko-breaded, extremely juicy goodness on a Hawaiian roll with a side of Japanese potato salad.  I still can't get over how juicy this slider was!  The food was fantastic and really warms the soul.

Real bbq ribs are PULL not FALL off the bone.  Such a thing is unacceptable for quality bbq and is indicative of the use of a non-pit form of smoking, which is to say a method of cooking foreign to barbecue.

We decided to give this Ramen place another try thinking they would have worked out their long wait issues, but we were mistaken. It was cold and pouring rain that evening, when we got to the restaurant there was a long line outside. When we stepped in a waiter came us and said it was not allowed to stand where we were standing and we had to stand behind a line on the floor (due to safety reasons) and wait outside the door... in the cold and rain. There is a very prominent sign on the door that gives you all kinds of instructions on how to stand in line and how to behave when you are in line... really? We were about to order and behind us were a party of 3, we were a party of 2, the waiter wanted to seat the party of 3 first because 3 seats were readily available. We agreed out of politeness. But this is not the customers problem, inadequate seating arrangements in a restaurant is the restaurants problem. There are other popular restaurants in town that has similar long lines outside, I can think of a burger place on Anderson and Mopac. But they seems to manage their lines very well. For example, instead of posting a notice saying don't cut in line, they could rope off the line like other places do... anyway all this should not be the consumers problem. These are some basic things consumers expect from hospitality business like a restaurant.

Then it took a while for our luggage to come out and of course the rental car company was slammed with other renters.  I was lucky to have a friend that picked up the preorder or else we wouldn't have been able to eat the legendary smoked meats.\\n\\nOf course we over ordered (6lbs of brisket, 1lb of turkey and a lb of spare ribs).  Though my friend requested to have the point (fattier piece of the brisket) they were fair and gave us 3 lbs of the point and 3 lbs of the flat (leaner piece of the brisket).  I did notice the point being a lot more moist than the flat.  This was more than likely due to the fact that the meat was sitting for an hour and half after being cut.  Included were 2 types of bbq sauce (both were tasty), sliced white onions, pickles and Texas white bread.  I think it's been over 20 years since I've had white bread and damn did it taste good!!!  The brisket did have a decent smoke ring but thought it was slightly under seasoned.  No doubt was the brisket good but honestly didn't live up to they hype I had for them.  The turkey was flat out dry and most likely due to the fact that it was sitting for such a long time.\\n\\nWould I wait 3+ hours for Franklin's again?

There are elements of Hakka (info- Chinese) , Indian , Chinese and Nepal flavors, in addition to native dishes. This blend usually results in an explosion of variety, and diverse flavor. Sadly , the latter was absent. \\nWe made the mistake of going there on a Saturday night. The place was overflowing with people and incredibly noisy. As a result of prior reservations we were seated, and given water. (BYOB place). We ordered the veggie dumplings, paneer appetizer and the Bombay Brussels for starters. Our apps arrived in 20 minutes, which I thought was decent, given the crowd. \\nThe dumplings were excellent. I loved the dipping sauce and the potions. The Bombay Brussels lived up to the flavor expectation - the combination of turmeric with the Brussels sprouts was definitely a good thing. The paneer- run of the mill. \\n20 minutes after the apps were empty, the waiter came up to us to get our entrees orders. We ordered 3 entrees, relatively easy ones to make under the most pressing of circumstances. An hour passed , AN HOUR. We hailed the head waiter, who was unfortunately rude to us because we pointed out that  parties that arrived after us were being attended to and fed while we waited around empty plates. To add insult to injury, it appeared that our order wasn't placed at all, that the head waiter refused to acknowledge and apologize for. Sigh. \\nWhen the food did appear, it was okay at best. I've tasted much better dhal Makhani at smaller and more inexpensive restaurants ,and portions are a slight joke. \\nIt always amazes me how restaurants, despite making customers wait for food, always manage to deliver the receipt at the speed of light. The manager apologized for the delay, we told him no offense was taken , and we literally ran out. \\nI need to point this out. This restaurant caters to the Caucasian palate.

Two floors and they do cram us in there. The carts do pass by but can't always get to all the tables. \\nI am not Chinese but have never felt punished for this. Yes they do tend to send lots of people downstairs but it's always mixed clientele on both levels. \\nI have started asking to be upstairs if it's only 2-4 of us but if we are here with a big group, who cares!!! Food is all the same up or down. \\nOne can eat a ton and have great fun for very little $$\\nEat at noon or after and you don't have to eat again all day!!\\nThe crowds do thicken around 12:30 on so if you want less hassle and quicker seating make it an earlier start. 9-12 is easier!\\nAll in all good fun dim sum."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered my TOAD burger medium, but it was well done.

We ordered: steak frites (overpriced and underwhelming), chicken (chicken), pasta (interesting start, but the nearly burned squash seeds overpowered the dish). From the starters menu, the potato and monkfish croquettes were spot on--crispy, flavorful. The lobster curry was, surprisingly, a soup-based starter with a nice curry flavor, but the delicate flavor of the lobster chunks were lost in it. Cauliflower four ways--couldn't quite determine three and four, but it was good and a lot of yummy, grilled cauliflower. We also ordered two vegetable sides--Brussel sprouts and broccoli. Both were solid. We ordered two desserts--flan and apple crisp. Flan tasted like meat.

While the bill was by no means cheap, it proved to be worth every cent.\\n\\nThe brisket is hands down the best brisket I've ever had. This is coming from a self-proclaimed bbq aficionado who's experienced most of the popular bbq joints in the greater Austin area. The lean brisket was amazing, lean but not dry, with a perfect half-inch of fat along the top of the slices. Perfectly peppered. The ribs were also heavenly, providing a minimal resistance to every enthusiastic bite. The turkey, unfortunately, was not as great as I remembered. It was soaked in butter after sliced to provide more moisture, according to the server. It became too moist in my opinion, as well as decreasing the peppery taste of the turkey.\\n\\nI'm not a massive fan of Franklin's bbq sauce, especially their espresso coffee sauce which comes as no surprise given my dislike for coffee.

A cup of coffee from the coffee truck and a few puppies running around helped pass the time. Going to Franklin's BBQ is an experience not just a lunch. We had 1.5lbs of brisket (a mix of point and flat - aka fatty and lean), 1lb of pork ribs, 0.5lb pulled pork, 3 sausages, beans and coleslaw. All of the food was gluten free and AMAZING! The brisket is the best I have ever had. It was moist, tender and had awesome flavor. The seasoning of salt and pepper made a great bark.

We were actually walking over to Figo when he spotted TeaFuse and wanted to check it out.  They had some salads and sandwiches so we decided to eat there instead.  As soon as we walked in this incredibly unpleasant odor hit our nostrils.  The closest thing I can describe the smell to is someone getting their hair permed at a salon.  That was almost enough to make us want to leave but I just said it was probably some weird funky tea and we decided to suck it up (although I've never smelled something this rank at other tea houses).  My boyfriend ordered the TeaFuse chopped salad with turkey and I just got the hummus.  There were only 5 other people in the place when we sat down so we were expecting it to be quick especially since the items we ordered didn't require any cooking.  The kid at the counter was a little awkward and didn't seem very socialized...maybe it was his first time working in a \\"restaurant\\".  Anyways we sat down and expected our food to be out within 5 minutes but ended up being a very  long 20 minutes.  On the menu my boyfriend's salad was described with the following ingredients  \\"field greens tomato, onion,  veggies & gorgonzola cheese; add turkey $.75\\" instead it was romaine lettuce, with beans, feta cheese, and one slice of deli turkey chopped up. The presentation was pretty lame and my boyfriend said the dressing tasted weird and he was probably going to be hungry again in a few minutes since the amount of toppings were pretty small.  My hummus actually wasn't too bad but wasn't worth the 20 min wait.  As someone who's worked in the service industry for many years I have patience for most things when I go out to eat but there was no reason for us to wait that long when only 5 other people were there and our food required no cooking.  I definitely have no reason to ever go there again...especially with that smell. Granted it's probably our fault for ordering food at a tea house...lesson learned!  I'm giving it 2 stars since the staff was friendly and the decor was cute but they definitely need to get rid of that smell and work on the food and timing."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"i love bringing people to eat dim sum. they either love it or they hate it. if they hate it, i beat them fisticuffs style until they come to their senses. for realz.\\nthis is the best place in boston to experience dim sum, and one of those places that truly will become an excuse to come into the city if you don't frequently find yourself here. there is really little to nothing better than having your food come to you, and being able to pick and choose items regardless of whether you know what you will be chowing down on actually is. after a few times here, however, you'll begin to recognize what you like, so maybe i can give you guys a few recommendations. try to find the cart that has looks like it has a few bumps of shrimp that are rolled in a long, fat \\"burrito\\" blanket of a white noodle. not sure what the actual name is, but my friends and i call it the slippery noodle. they serve it t you with a salty/sweet sauce, squirted out of a bottle. there are also a plethora of dumplings: shyumai style with mushrooms is very good, ones with shrimp in the middle are very good (i think wrapped with a rice flour wrapper, but not sure), and then there are also the deep fried variety with onion, shrimp and beef filling (these may be the safest bet for the slightly timid eater). i also enjoy their variety of buns, especially those stuffed with barbecue pork.\\nthe place is a little hard to find, as it is outside of chinatown, but worth a special visit. also note that there is a parking garage upstairs, and the restaurant will validate your ticket. furthermore, though the place is almost always crowded for dim sum (not served at dinner time), i've never waited longer than about ten minutes for a table."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad we were able to have brunch at this place during our short stay in Portland.

I had a mini-stuffed pizza with extra sauce and bell peppers.\\n\\nPros:\\n- The stuffed crust pizza was really good, better than I had at a Gino's in Chicago that I went to last October.\\n- The lunch combo, which consists of a 6\\" pizza, salad, and drink, was very reasonably priced at $8.99 before taxes.\\n- The mini-stuffed pizzas come out relatively quickly, unlike the larger ones, which take a while to cook.\\n- They have quite a variety of food on the menu besides just pizzas.\\n- They offer thin slices that are not shown on the menu.\\n- The location on 6th Street is really conveniently located downtown.\\n- The service is quick, as long as you call ahead for larger stuffed pizzas.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The wait service was horrendous.  I think our waiter was overwhelmed.  He did not bring enough silverware, which we had to ask for multiple times, nor did he bring enough napkins, which I had to get myself from another table.  We also did not get drink refills without asking.  They also missed two pizza slices that we definitely ordered, and instead of making the order correct, he was more concerned about making sure we received the number of slices for which we were charged despite his mistake of incorrectly bringing the number of slices that we clearly ordered.  I do not blame him at all, but rather blame the management for obviously poor training of the wait staff.\\n- The menu that they provide guests is outdated and incorrect.  It shows lunch specials for $7.95 that includes a mini-stuffed pizza, soup or fries, and salad for $7.95. I requested the soup as shown on the menu, but they said they no longer include the soup...OK, then fix the menu! Duh.  This again shows the poor management at this restaurant.\\n\\nTip: call ahead for stuffed pizzas that are larger than the mini-pizzas due to the long time it takes to cook (nominal 45 to 60 minutes).  Also, they offer thin cheese and pepperoni slices that are not shown on the menu (these are the only toppings they offer on the slices).  It is unclear why they cannot place other toppings on the cheese slices and throw it in the oven.  The thin slices have very little pizza sauce on them, unlike the stuffed pizzas.\\n\\nI give Gino's 4 stars for the stuffed pizza and 1 star for the service, resulting in 3 stars overall (Yelp does not allow half stars).  I would only come here again by myself or in a small group or take-out, but certainly not with larger groups until they improve their wait staff training and update their menus."},{"name":"China Sky","address":"27 Converse Pl","city":"Winchester","stars":"4","text":"Best Chinese food around.

However, whenever I think of a deli, I immediately think that it \\"sounds too healthy.\\"  Now that I'm making it a point to eat healthier and watching my calorie intake, Jason's Deli seemed to be the perfect restaurant to check out.\\n\\nThis particular location is closest to my apartment, and it was most convenient since my friend and I were hanging out in the area.  We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday, and the place was relatively quiet before the dinner rush.\\n\\nIt was my first time at a Jason's Deli, so I took a couple minutes to scan through the menu.  As soon as I came across the \\"Eat Lite, Here\\" section of the menu, I knew that I would order from there.\\n\\nThere are six items under the \\"Eat Lite, Here\\" section (between 320 to 510 calories): Turkey Wrap, Spinach Veggie Wrap, Club Lite, Mediterranean Wrap, Turkey Reuben, and Savvy Chicken Salad Wrap.  Each is served with your choice of \\"fresh fruit, steamed veggies, baked chips or organic blue corn tortilla chips with salsa.\\"   I love that the menu shows the number of calories and fat content of each of the \\"Lite\\" items.  I ordered the Savvy Chicken Salad Wrap (no red onions) with steamed veggies.\\n\\nYou order and pay at the front counter, and you will get a number to set on your table so that a server could bring your food to you when it's ready.  We didn't have to wait very long for our food to be prepped and served.\\n\\n* Savvy Chicken Salad Wrap ($4.99) - Per the menu, this \\"Lite\\" wrap consists of \\"Organic wheat wrap with chicken salad made with almonds and pineapple, roma tomatoes, red onions, leafy lettuce. 354 calories, 14 g. total fat, 3 g. saturated fat.\\"  For the price (and number of calories), I thought it was a decently-sized wrap, which was served cut in half.  The wrap was actually pretty good!  This must have been the first time I had a chicken salad wrap that contained pineapples!  It was *just* the right amount of sweet and salty.  Normally a lover of fries/chips, the steamed veggies were a big change.  I ate it to fill up my stomach, but it wasn't especially tasty or anything.\\n\\nOverall, Jason's Deli gets 4 stars for their good, healthier menu items and fast, friendly service.  Since I'm participating in Yelp's \\"In it to Thin It,\\" I'm *trying* to avoid desserts whenever possible.  Therefore, I haven't tried their free soft serve ice cream, but I will definitely be back and enjoy some after my weigh-in at the end of the month.  I'm looking forward to trying some of their \\"non-Lite\\" menu items in the near future!\\n\\n[Review 006 of 100]"},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This is 100% not recommended.

Yes, I know it was a children's place, but it seems like it could have been a bit more contained.  Bottom line, if you want to spend over $100 on a kids place, you are much better off at big als.

I chose poorly and went with the Budda burger, meaning it was topped with butter, and it was just way too buttery and greasy for me, not to mention it had onions on it even though it wasn't listed on the menu (and no lettuce/tomato). But the rest of my crowd was happy with their own burger toppings, so I think I just need to pick something else next time. (Note: a simple turkey burger with cheese on a return visit was excellent.)\\n\\nI split the 50/50 (fries and rings) with 1 other person, although the basket was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people. The fries were standard and unmemorable, but I really liked the onions, they were really thin and crispy. I got a raspberry-lime rickey which was tasty. Also, their black and white frappes are delicious, highly recommended.\\n\\nThe server forgot our side of ranch dressing, but it's a really casual restaurant (i.e. plastic and paper) and more of a take-out type place IMO, so that can be forgiven. Food came out fast and fresh, and there are a myriad of dipping sauces and condiments on each table.\\n\\nPrices are a little high and things add up... a single burger is $5.50, rickey is $2.50, and 50/50 is $4, so it's definitely no McD's.

Saw it on Phantom Gourmet and decided to try it, and surprisingly, I wasn't disappointed. This isn't your plain old run of the mill burger; there is a certain flavor that many burgers are lacking that is definitely present in the burgers here. Spicy isn't the right word but it seems as if they add some sort of spices and seasonings for flavor to their burgers.\\n\\nI've eaten in here about 4 or 5 times. I usually get the double cheeseburger with bacon. The bacon is GREAT. Some places have horrible bacon on their bugers and that kinda ruins it, but this place has great bacon. Very tasty. The toppings are good too, but not really on par with fuddruckers in the sense of quantity or amount of choices, not to mention most toppings add significantly to your bill.\\n\\nTried their fried banana and caramel cheesecake once and was pleasantly surprised. I usually hate anything with banana but this was very good. How can you go wrong with fried cheesecake? Plus I think it was 2 or 3 bucks, which is *great.* \\n\\nThe fries are pretty good; they taste fresh and very vegetable-y rather than greasy. Like hand cut, not sure if they are though. The onion rings are similar... very onion-y and not a thick layer of breading. They're not your normal burger joint's onion rings; kinda different what I'm used to and I wasn't sure if I liked them or not at first. In retrospect, they were pretty good but I'd say fries over rings at this place. \\n\\nThat said, I haven't been able to try anything other than their burgers because their burgers are so addictive and good. Well priced, at around 4 to 6 dollars. Many places charger 9-11$ for a burger that isn't even as good. The one bad thing about this place is that extras are a little pricey but totally worth it in the long run.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a stop. Get a burger and you'll be happy, they're what made me give this burger joint a five out of five.\\n\\nUpdate: Went back to Flat Patties again a few more times. Let me say that the onion rings are actually quite awesome. I am really getting addicted to them. They have their own style so dont go in with expectations, but they are tasty and fresh and not over battered. If you like thick batter or greasy limp rings, these aren't your rings. \\n\\nLove being able to watch them cook my burger too. It's like dinner and entertainment for free and it just makes you want it that much more when you watch them throw it on the grill.\\n\\nThis is one of those places that after I ate there, I felt absolutely 100% satisfied and just genuinely happy. My advice: Double Cheeseburger with Bacon, Onions, Cheese, and either mustard/ketchup or BBQ depending on what you are in the mood for. Side of fries or onion rings too. You'll be full and just feel \\"fat and happy.\\""},{"name":"Fez Bistro Cafe","address":"1331 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife & I found this place because of their sign outside mentioning vegan/vegetarian options.

Sil and the band sounded good as usual.  I had heard the bass player, Neil Starkey, in the 1990s, playing regularly at the Penta Hotel in midtown Atlanta.  There were a number of singers sitting in during the first set. \\n\\nThen as the second set began, a lady named Juju, sat behind a pair of conga drums.

Apres Diem had instantly become a hip place.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was fun.  Juju also sings and resurrected memories of Dinah Washington with her own, soulful interpretation of \\"What A Difference A Day Makes\\".

As it is, we're fortunate to still have 903 Mills.\\n\\nI know the ownership just changed hands. I must admit that's a concern to me, chiefly because the old crew was friendly, gregarious, and spot-on. A few buddies were eating some late dinner at 903 Mills last night after the Magic game, so I stopped by.\\n\\nI couldn't justify going with the Grateful Bread that late at night as it's a carb-and-sodium extravaganza. It's also one of the best sandwiches I've ever consumed. I wasn't really hungry, so I thought I would take a look at their wine selection.

There was a lot going on downtown, but the place wasn't overly packed, so I'm not sure how busy this spot gets on weekends. I'm sure once the apartments go up across the street, they'll get plenty of business.\\n\\nI'm not sure what it is about Condado, maybe the sauces, maybe the meats, but I've always just found the tacos to be pretty average. Doing some build my own tacos with very simple toppings (chorizo/cilanto/onion/queso fresca/secret taco sauce with a Ju-Ju shell), I still wasn't blown away. I love the Ju-Ju shell, which is essentially their version of a Cheesy Gordita Crunch at Taco Bell, but the meat and sauces are just okay. I'm a big hot sauce person, and their ghost sauce is just not hot at all, and doesn't really compare to the other higher end taco joints on High St. let alone the authentic taco trucks around Columbus.\\n\\nI will say that the queso and guacamole here are very good, and I'm a big fan of the chips that come with them. The margaritas here are great as well, especially the spicy one with jalapenos.

I'd advise going with one of their taco suggestions if it's your first time, since they really know what flavor profiles go together, and you might find something you really like.\\n\\nI'd say I probably won't be back any time soon, but I always say that and end up right back here, so it can't be all that bad."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Don't hate me...but I didn't love Dirty Frank's.

Unfortunately we accepted and got to wear a pirate hat that's probably been cycled through thousands of time on other people's head. I obliged and we got our family picture taken and charged $30. By the way, you're NOT allowed you to take a picture with your own camera. \\n\\nI was there for the pre-game show and it was somewhat amusing where there's a mini scuffle/betrayal between the kingdom and pirates which develops into the show you're about to see. The bar is open and there's not much of a selection. The mix drinks and regular beer was pricey, but you get to keep the glass. Unfortunately, one of the glass was labeled with a sticker instead of a printed inlay.\\n\\nThe food was ok, nothing spectacular. Unlike what D.S said, beer was NOT unlimited. The first pitcher of Bud Light for the entire table was free, but that's it. Getting the server to come back with stuff like more drinks or anything is virtually impossible. \\n\\nFor me it was a cool little production, but with the attitude from some of the people working here to the mediocre food I wouldn't think it was worth it. On the flip-side of things you can take them as playing into their pirate character, whom don't give a hoot. \\n\\nOverall, our kid had a blast and for what it's worth I can't bear to take the joy out of that.

On the phone everyone was super nice and helpful, and I was really looking forward to the evening.\\n\\nWhen my party arrived the previous party had not yet vacated their seats...in fact there were two large parties there.  When I had booked the girl on the phone had mentioned this, but said that by 8 pm that would leave enough time for the previous big group to finish up.  Turns out the big group before us decided to eat appies for 2 hours and ordered their entrees at 8 o'clock.\\n\\nThis is no biggie, they got us into two split tables, the hostess was super friendly, and the owner came by to chat with us too.  The hostess informed us that they would try to get us into the same table eventually, but the two big groups didn't leave until 10pm, and after 2 hours we were pretty established in our seats.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the hostess wasn't our regular server.  Our regular server came around every 20 minutes or so to take one or two orders at a time.  Keep in mind there was over a dozen of us.  If you wanted water you had to ask her for it, and some people told me afterwards they sat there thirsty for nearly half an hour.  \\n\\nI don't know if it had to do with the fact that there were two other huge parties there, which might have made them a little slammed in the personnel department.  But still, I don't know why they can't have pads of paper to jot down everyone's order at the same time...?\\n\\nIn terms of the food, the poutine is DIVINE.  House-smoked brisket, delicious gravy, hot fries, melty cheese.  HEAVEN.  POUTINE HEAVEN.  If this was a review for poutine I'd give them a bajillion yelp stars.  The duck drumstick was a big ducky thing that was tasty but also pricey at $10 for one drumstick.  I was told by my friends that the french onion soup was very yummy and very rich.\\n\\nThe only other star I'm docking them for is because when we got our bill we weren't informed that there was an 18% gratuity charge added to it.\\n\\nBEFORE YOU REAM ME OUT: I'm totally down with the mandatory gratuity.  Large groups can be hell to deal with.  That being said they should make a note of it somewhere, or tell you verbally just as a reminder, because some people added tip on top of their bill (ending up tipping something like 30%), which would be okay, if we 1) got waters regularly 2) didn't have to sit around feeling sad when the server takes one person's order, and ignores the next person\\n\\nWould I recommend this place to others?  Yes, because the food is good, and the ambiance is cool.  But just go in a party of 6 max, most of the tables seem to fit that size party much better."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We love Seasons and Regions...food is always fantastic...lots of choices on the menu and the chefs are always creative to accommodate any diet.  5 Stars and 10 Thumbs up for this wonderful neighborhood gem!"},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm still thinking wistfully about this burger the next day.\\n\\nFor six bucks, I had a Foster Burger with Swiss and it made me so happy, let me count the ways:\\n\\n1.

Maybe if I had ordered the gravy on the side I would have been able to enjoy my breakfast. As it was I had to dig through the pile to find the egg and bacon. This is not a breakfast for those who don't like their food all touching or stirred together in one pile. My husband described his breakfast as a heavy stick to your ribs meal. I did taste his cheddar grits (which were minus the gravy mine had) and they were very tasty."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"5351 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"We were there for dinner with a party of eight.

On a Friday, we had a chance to try out their dinner menu. On the night, this place was packed and  I guess everyone in the neighborhood wanted to party. On that night, Buttermilk fried confit lamb belly, Slow braised pork cheek and Grilled Humboldt squid. The lamb belly was good. I liked the honey ginger with the buttermilk combo and it brought the favors from the meat. However, the fat of belly was trapped within the batter which made the dish a little rich for my taste. I rather they render the fat and had a crispier crest in texture. The pork cheek dish was good. The meat was perfectly cooked in a sort of Lebanese style method. As for the black beans, I believed they put too much vinegar on the beans and it was overpowering the dish a bit much. The Humboldt squid was great and they were tender and great in favor. I also liked the pepperoni ragu and it was well-pair with the potato puree. The only thing that I do not like was the potato croquettes. It doe not paired with the dish and it complex my pallet in texture of the dish (too much potato). Overall, I have a good experience on that night.

They guy working the counter was super nice too. I had  no idea what I was doing when I first walked in. They had a cake dish with some cupcakes on display, and a couple trays of their minis. I kept trying to order minis that they didn't have. I couldn't get it through my head for some reason that big cupcake doesn't equal mini cupcake. I've been a little sleep deprived lately. The guy was really nice about it. They also seem to keep their cupcakes in this...thing...I'll call it a cupcake vault. I think it's where they stick them so they stay fresh.\\n\\nI ended up getting two of their Pumpkinators and two of their Double Doses. For four HOUGE cupcakes, it was only $12. That might sound expensive, but these things are huge! I essentially bought a cake...a cake that didn't last too long...\\n\\nI took them back to my friends work. We both had one of each. I started with the Pumpkinator while he tried a Double Dose. The Pumpkinator was beyond divine! My mom, for as long as I can remember, has made spice cake every Christmas and Thanksgiving with cream cheese frosting, and the Pumpkinator totally ran her cake over and left it in the middle of the road. I'm a fan of rich food, so maybe I'm not the best judge, but it was the best cupcake I'd ever had. I hate the word \\"moist\\" but the actual cupcake was...yeah...and the frosting was fluffy and cream cheesey. My friend, after two bites of the Double Dose, said that he though he had just developed diabetes, but he ate it all and said it was really good. He didn't say anything when he had the Pumpkinator, but it was gone rather quickly. When I took a bit out of Double Dose, I could see where he was coming from. It was really dense, and the frosting was really thick and sweet. I liked it, but I could see where people would have a hard time with it. Okay, so, I don't. If you don't want something sweet, why are you eating a F***ing cupcake? I never got that. I never got why people who are eating anything in the pastry department that has the word \\"cake\\" in it complain about it being sweet. That's stupid. Anyway...\\n\\nThe cupcakes were awesome!

The salads are good. The calzones are somtimes fantastic. My friends really like it (though they more often than not get salad or wings, not pizza, go figure).\\n\\nOkay, the bad -- intolerable wait for food, even when there are just a few customers. I have no clue why it takes so long. I'll see food at the counter ready to get taken to tables, and they'll sit -- maybe they're still getting plated -- for what seems far longer than necessary. When the food comes, more often than not, it's not as hot as it should be straight from the kitchen. So, kudos for them for making sure my mouth isn't burned by salad.\\n\\nWhen you DO get the food, you never really know what you are going to get -- the first time I had a slice of pizza here, the dough was on the raw side of undercooked -- we're talking, wet paper towel limp. Out of deference to my friends who raved about the place, I continued eating the slice, but after that point, on following (multiple) visits, I opted for the salads instead.\\n\\nOut of maybe 15 or so visits, I've maybe had pizza four or five times after that first experience. The last time, a week ago, it was actually, surprisingly, good. A pizza place SHOULD be built on a strong foundation of pizza. I'm not sure what foundation they've built their place on.\\n\\nI WILL say the whole pizzas I've shared with friends here have been good, so it seems their pizza-by-the-slice is their kryptonite. I, however, judge a pizza place by their slice, and I judge Mellow Mushroom harshly.\\n\\nThe calzones have been spotty -- sometimes all doughy with a sliver of filling, but a couple times they've been good, surprisingly. I'll probably have a couple more.\\n\\nThe salads -- avoid the iceberg lettuce, sometimes you get the bitter heart (it's as if they know me!), sometimes it's all brown and wilty -- you are better off with spring mix or spinach. Don't spring for the chicken add-on -- sometimes it's a mound, sometimes it's half of what you'd had before, but in any case NOT worth the extra cost.\\n\\nSandwiches are decent enough for a pizza place.\\n\\nCost. A salad and tea should not cost $12 + tip. A couple slices and water should not cost $10 + tip. A sandwich will set you back $9, sans chips, but they have a half-order, which is nice if you have half an appetite. I seldom have half an appetite.\\n\\nThe ONLY reason I've come here so often is my friends like it and I accompany then. On my own, there is NO way I'd come here -- the wait is intolerably long, the food is pretty \\"meh,\\" and for the price, I can eat a hell of a lot better elsewhere.\\n\\nI do hear they have live music, trivia night, and a nice bar. Given my lunch-time experiences there, I've NEVER been inclined to make this a destination place in the evening, and given my other options for nighttime destination spots, I can't see myself ever hitting this place at night.\\n\\nI'd forgive them if their pizza by the slice was consistently good, or worth the cost. But it's not on either front. So when I have a choice of pizza place, I hit Hoboken, Hoeks, East Side Pies, or Roppolo's. Even Jackalope's street pizza by the slice is superior."},{"name":"Boca Grande","address":"1728 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"After a long day of work, traffic, gym, sometimes all I want to do is order myself a pound of burrito-y goodness. \\n\\nAmazing enchiladas and my personal favorite: chicken ranchero burrito grande. \\n\\nI probably eat here more than I'd like to admit. :)"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The majority of the 3-star, or less, reviews seem to be coming from Asians.

Mellow Mushroom is a pretty decent pizza, but it doesn't quite compare to the ones i've had in new york (mmm i love that thin crispy crust), or even some of the ones in dallas (see: olivella's). \\n\\nBut Mellow Mushroom is not too shabby, especially for late night food. Lots of choices of toppings, a fun mix of toppings. We had the meat lovers pizza - generous portions of sausage, pepperoni, and ham. Definitely made for a happy stomacn. Crust is more of a crispy thicker type - not really doughey or fluffy but definitely chewy. there was some garlic sprinkled on top of the crust, which definitely adds to the flavor. \\n\\nif it was just for the pizza, this restaurant would have gotten a pretty solid 3 stars. not terribly awesome pizza, but definitely still holds its own. what puts it over the top, you ask?? \\n\\nother than the ballon animals obvi, one taste of that yummy, tomatoey soft and chewy bruschetta and i'm pretty sure you'll die and go straight to hippie heaven. the bruschetta was probably one of the best i've ever had. the bread was oh-so-soft. none of this hard crunchy bread that so many chefs like to use. tomatoes were perfectly diced and seasoned on top, spinkled over with balsamic. the balsamic interestingly enough gave it kind of a sweeter flavor. \\n\\nso do yourselves a favor, and if all you get is the bruschetta, you'll thank for me for it later.  You are very welcome =) \\n\\n------------\\n\\non another note, as other reviewers have mentioned, the service here is pretty awful. maybe it's b/c the dye in all the waiters' hairs have started to seep into their brains, but for some reason, they seem to take forever to notice anything going on around them. oh well - get the bruschetta anyways (like i said) and you'll forget about it."},{"name":"The Reef","address":"4172 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here for dinner with a bunch of co-workers, one of whom was Caribbean and she said this place was quite good for Vancouver.  \\n\\nThe ambience of this place was quite fun and social.

The Bayou Bleu was too rich, and I could only down 2 slices of a medium. There was just a cheese overload, but otherwise the combination of grilled shrimp and sasauge with the cheese was pleasing.

That said, until they accommodate a main entry without any meat products, they get a mediocre rating from me. \\n\\nWe were offered sides like the curry bowl, but I came for a birthday dinner, and wanted to eat what a restaurant is known for, ramen, not side dishes. So we left. \\n\\nNow, I'm not the type of vegetarian that expects every chef or restaurant to cater to my diet, but come on, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect at least one main entry to be meat free.  Hell, Burger King offers a veggie burger these days!\\n\\nGood luck Ramen Tatsu-Ya.  I love part of ya. I love your location. I like the aesthetic and feel of the joint, but I'm not there to chew on chopsticks.  I look forward to seeing the menu develop more veggie options as you grow.

I'm no stranger to waiting for tasty food, and based on both the reviews and the sheer volume of people outside, this was to be expected. Unfortunately, it was closer to an hour and a half later as we were FINALLY debating just bouncing that we got called in (for our enormous... party of two).\\n\\nOnce inside, the food was a delight, the mimosas not shy. And while our server was friendly, I was a little uncomfortable with his comments about previous guests... apparently some customers shortly before us had been rude and given him some attitude. While I get that this can be upsetting, as someone who has worked in food service and is also a human being, I didn't feel like this was something he should be talking about to the other guests? You go in the back and bitch to your coworkers, you don't come out and talk shit to the other diners.\\n\\nWe did the standard, \\"Hi, how are you?\\" \\"Good, how are you?\\" with our server, and he responded with some comments about guests with attitude and how he hoped we would go over better. It was obviously a joke, but it definitely made me feel like maybe we would do something to upset or offend him, and would be next on the proverbial chopping block? I later heard him regaling the story to the table of guests next to us, so it wasn't a one-off comment, but a guy looking for validation from the wrong people. \\n\\nAgain, the food was good and not expensive, but there are lots of good or great breakfast places, that are not expensive, that don't require an hour and a half wait in addition to awkward service.

We each got fried chicken which was wonderfully crisp & had a little kick to it but not overwhelming at all- just great flavor.  For our sides they brought out mac & cheese, roasted beets, carrots, cabbage & greens.  I could've done with more mac & cheese & less cabbage & greens but it was all delicious. I could eat that mac & cheese for a meal & be perfectly satisfied.  For dessert my friend got ice cream & I got the peanut butter oreo pie which was my least favorite part of the meal but still tasty.

The fish cake wasn't that great and the choy sum is kind of expecting, but everything else was great. If I were to go back for anything it would be the lobster dim sum and the jin dui. The lobster dish melts in your mouth and you get big chunks of meat with every bite. The jin dui was exceptionally light and had a nice paste. It wasn't too sweet and got rid of any salty taste.

Well considering the guys who own the place have some of the best restaurants in P-town I thought it was worth a look. Apparently so did everyone else who lives in the SE, it was packed! Usually when the hostess tells me \\"it'll be a 45 minute wait\\" she's already seeing my backside before finishing her sentence. However something besides all the hype told me I should stay, so I stifled my angry stomach and took a chance. \\n\\nAfter actually waiting the 45 minutes I had plenty -O- time to look over the menu and decide there was only one option. I like their scheme, I mean if you're going to pay $10 for a burger by the time you add bacon and you ARE then why not sport the extra $1.50 and get the gut busting Road Pile-Up. It's hard enough to deny a fried egg and some juicy bacon on my burger, throw some cheese, saut√©ed onions and even pickled beet at me and it turns into a sure thing. And to accompany it? I questioned the cockshake but it felt too dirty so I stuck with a nice house selected beer. Before having an anxiety attack from starvation our burgers finally arrived. Not to say the service was bad just that I was ready to KILL for food. \\n\\nWhen it arrived it certainly looked menacing with all its layers piled high upon my plate. I thought it was best to attack it by cutting it in half as not to eject the contents from the other side after my jaw dropping brute force. With the fresh An Xuyen bakery roll starring back at me I took my first bite and lost the ability to speak for the next 20 minutes. I realized now why I had waited 45 minutes, when asked how it was I simply blinked to confirm my bliss. It was juicy, flavorful, and a complete mess! As always my egg and smoky bacon further complimented the juicy beef, while the onions and beet gave a nice acidity and textural combination. For the second act I figured I might as well add every option to my burger and stuff some fries in there as well. It's not the first time I have seen or eaten fries in a sandwich and again it was a delight! By the time I was done the table was gawking and I was licking my fingers clean.

This place is definitely more of a bar than restaurant.\\n\\nThe food, however, was a different story. We started off with the calamari, which was lightly breaded and fried just right.

Both were quite mediocre. The tuna wasn't the freshest, though not overtly \\"fishy\\" (it could have been grilled a touch longer, the dressing was okay, the egg salad or whatever it came with tasted downright weird (I'll try to explain it, but it seemed as though they finely chopped a hard boiled egg, put in a bunch celery, onions, and raw yellow egg yolk... the concoction was just weird). \\nThe short ribs, on the other hand was okay. The first bite was excellent probably because I started on a thinner portion of the meat. The rest of it was hard and over-cooked.

This is more on point with the smoked trout on toast trend.

Probably the best bread pudding I've had. \\n\\nI would also like to say that our bartender was incredibly helpful and accommodating.

This is my first time to ever post a review but I am just too angry not to. At noon of August 9, 2015, they wrongly charged 350 dollars instead of 35 dollars from my card, and then immediately changed back to 35 dollars. However, because of delay of credit card company, I received a notification that 350 dollars were deducted in the evening. We immediately got a uber there and argued with them. Their night time manager accepted me and explained and asked me to wait for two days, which I accepted. However, when we asked about the compensation for money and time we spent on pursuing this matter, the manager started ignoring us and was extremely rude to us when asked for an explanation. He even shouted in public, and I quote (translated from more harsh Chinese), \\"I didn't ask you to come, you come yourself. I cannot help you with this. Whatever you like to do with this, I don't care.\\"\\"What else do you want me to do? I didn't even scold or hit you!\\" Like scolding or hitting an unsatisfied customer is what he should be doing. Unbelievable! We don't care about the money and it's the absolutely awful attitude that bugs us. I have been to Hei La Moon for at least 10 times and they all recognize my face, and if that's how they treat me, imagine how they would treat other customers. We asked for an apology after being ignored for 10 minutes, and what we got from him was angry shouts and no apology concerning his attitude at all. His subordinates come to us and said that \\"it's not his fault, he was already scolded today and please just let him be\\", this is so weird and we didn't even know how to respond. Customers should keep their complaints because the manager has already been complained to? Doesn't that say something already? As a frequent customer who brought many business there, I have completely changed my opinion towards Hei La Moon and I will never ever go there again or bring any friends there. If you want to get into an unhappy conflict where you need to wait for your money to come back, get no compensation at all for your money and time spent on the dispute, and treated like sh*t, I strongly suggest you go to Hei La Moon."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went  for lunch, I'd been waiting for quite sometime to try this place out, but I don't do lines and other rigmarole, so I decided to pop in for a late lunch and give them a try.\\nService was awesome.

As soon as I knew this place was run by people from my corner of the world, I had to check it out. Happily, the food and service were so excellent I have already recommended it to friends of all different ethnicities. \\n\\nThe location is perfect, across the street from a charming park and just a short walk from my brother's house where we were staying. Also easily walkable from the train station if you happen to be coming from the city on the Fitchburg line. Inside, it's bright and clean, decorated with photos from the years when it was a fixture on Harvard Square -- apparently there are quite a few celebrities who share our enthusiasm for their deliciously fresh take on diner food.\\n\\nSpeaking of food: my husband had a cheesesteak omelette on a toasted sesame bagel, and I had a pastrami-swiss omelette with sides of toast and potatoes. The eggs were fresh, the meat salty and spicy and the cheese perfectly melted -- it was heaven! The potatoes were a slight misstep -- they were underseasoned and tasted boiled rather than fried -- but I couldn't have finished them anyway, we were so full.\\n\\nThe real stunner, though, was what the menu calls a \\"fruit cup.\\" I always like something sweet with breakfast, but I can't handle the sugar rush of french toast, so I ordered fruit because the side of ricotta cheese and honey sounded interesting. When it came, I actually gasped: it looked like a painting, a gorgeous tower of perfectly-ripened fruit. There were sticks of apple and nectarine; slices of kiwi, cantaloupe, honeydew, orange and grapefruit; halves of fig and kumquat; fresh blackberries, cherries, blueberries, and pomegranate seeds. That's just what I can remember off the top of my head; there were probably more! On the side was a small dish of ricotta cheese drizzled with the most fragrant honey; swirled together and spread on the fruit, it was more delicious than any dessert I can imagine, and far healthier. It absolutely made the meal, and whatever else you order, I urge you to end with this!\\n\\nThe coffee was hot and fresh and our server came by several times to refill it and check on us. She was friendly without hovering and made us feel very comfortable there. We will absolutely be back the next time we're in Boston. Long Live Leo's!

Franklin BBQ just put Austin back on the BBQ trail. I'm shocked at how good this brand new place is. Aaron Franklin is the owner, and this guy is cheating somehow. It should take years for a BBQ place to perfect their secrets and get their smoker \\"seasoned\\". \\n\\nHe clearly knows his stuff. First thing he does after I mention I have been wanting to try this place for 2 weeks is to tear off a hunk of the burnt end of a fatty brisket and hand it too me (so delicious and flavorful). This is an old fashion custom that truthfully isn't done as much as it should be (Mueller's being the only other well known spot, and a few I have tried in small cities). Speaking of Mueller's, I understand Aaron learned his craft from the old Mueller business in Austin, he also took the smoker with him when he left. He talked with me like I was a regular customer (which I'm about to become) and was possibly the friendliest owner I have meet. \\n\\nI got three meats, 2 sides, tried both sauces, and ofcourse white bread. \\nWhite bread- it was bread, what more do you want? \\nPotato Salad- had to much mustard, that is honestly the most negative thing I have to say about anything I had. \\nBeans- Great pepper taste. \\nSausage- Very densely packed, and a snappy case. Great flavor and a smooth smokiness \\nRibs- Strong flavors of salt and pepper. Rub on these were the perfect flavors. Meat was tender and cooked perfectly (and not boiled, but still super tender) \\nBrisket- Wow. had the fat rendered all the way through, perfectly webbed and very flavorful. It was actually to moist, and it feel apart, but that is a minor complaint. The bark was spicy, crispy, and perfectly smoky, and the meat super tender and moist. \\nSauces- I'm not a big sauce fan to begin with, and honestly, while different and unique, weren't perfect.  The sweet was to sweet, the hot to much vinegar.  And while I enjoyed the espresso taste, it just seemed off.  No harm no foul though.\\n\\nI would easily put this in the top 10 BBQ I have ever had. I think that come next years Texas Monthly Top 50, this could easily have earned its place in Top 5.

Hei La Moon are from the same owners as China Pearl so back then it was like all the (food) of China Pearl but in a shiny new room.  Oh how things change over time.\\n\\nFor years, we've coming for dim sum, often early in the morning on weekends, yet inexplicably the hostess continues to direct us downstairs regardless of how few people there are in the primary (non subterranean) dining room.  The first couple of times, we obliged and went downstairs to find that not only is the \\"new car smell\\" gone, but replaced by \\"old, greasy, needs a 'Stanley Steamer\\" guy to steam clean this whole nasty carpet\\" smell.   The point of continued maintenance and cleaning was lost - replaced by the old Chinatown saying, \\"f*ck it!\\".  More recently, we insisted on being seated upstairs - even accepting a longer wait.  The funny thing, the wait was never any longer, so why were we \\"guided\\" to sit downstairs in the first place?  Do I have some kind of \\"Brad Pitt carved asshole sign on my forehead\\" (e.g. \\"Inglorious Basterds\\")?  That had to be the case, as I saw no other clear seating pattern - with a random blend of old and young; Chinese and non - that warranted the Yankee fan at Fenway treatment.\\n\\nAnyhow despite the second class seating preference we continued to come - now more out of habit than anything else - although the food was still consistent.  Until....\\n\\nOn our last visit, I ordered a bowl of congee (a Chinese rice porridge) .  To my surprise, I hit a crunch.  Not a yummy, \\"was that peanut or cashew crunch.\\"  Not a \\"cookoo for cocoa puffs crunch\\" but rather a, \\"does someone have the number of my dentist crunch!\\"  There was a peanut sized hunk of glass in my congee!  Luckily it was not sharp but rather thick and well rounded - kind of like a piece broke off a thick glassed (blue) vase.  Either way, not cool.\\n\\nI raised my hand and brought this to the attention of one of the wait staff.  She too was shocked.  So much so that she ripped the piece of glass out of my hand (still dripping from spit and congee) and inspected it carefully.  Really?  No napkin, nothing - nor did I see her was her hands before helping other customers.  No additional comment needed.\\n\\nSo she came back, apologize and took the ONE DISH off the check.  Umm....really?!?!  REALLY!?!?!  One of the head waiters ultimately came back and wiped out the whole check.  A nice gesture, but all things considered, we decided that would be our last trip for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWe've switched back to Empire Garden - a favorite of my aunt's and I must say, it's been a pleasant trip back.\\n\\nFinally, can't a first class dining experience and awesome Chinese food in Chinatown be synonymous?  And we're not talking about a dramatic change in the food, but more so update the presentation and service.

My friend woke up early and started lining up here well before it opened, and although we were one of the first people in line (maybe 10th?), it still took us about another hour or so after it opened for us to actually be able to order our food and get seats (so a total of about 3 hrs....). The store is pretty small and you technically can't get a table until after you have already ordered, so jump on those seats as soon as you order! \\n\\nThe servers were really nice and offered us samples of the meat and I like how there are different levels of fattiness vs. lean meat! Personally, I prefer a little fat in my bbq cuz the meat is just more tender and juicy! My friend and I got the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with a side of potato salad and coleslaw. \\n\\nFirst off, the brisket was pretty good, but again I think it is pretty much the same as Rudy's if not a little bit better. However, some pieces were quite rough, burnt, and hard to chew. The ribs were actually pretty good and the meat was tender and succulent! The pulled pork was good also, but pretty average so I wouldn't suggest getting it .As for the sides, they were also good, but average. I much prefer the side dishes and creamed corn from Rudy's. The bbq sauce was pretty good though and I do prefer it here over Rudy's typical bbq sauce.

I work in the service industry so I understand the stresses that come with it, but I do think that the staff was overwhelmed with the large amount of people who came in at once from the event that we all attended. Despite these minor setbacks, the location is beautifully along the waterfront and has a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, with nice space heaters. As I previously said, j will definitely come back and expect to have a better experience with a significantly less amount of people."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"When I tried the brisket, I looked at my wife and thought \\"Really?\\" folks are standing in line for hours for this?

It's basically a tiny, crowded sliver of the sidewalk fenced off. There wasn't even enough room to put my purse down. Plus, there were homeless people walking by and trying to make conversation, or just staring, which was extremely uncomfortable. Inside was pretty dark and extremely loud. \\n\\nThe chips were hot but clearly overdone. Our waitress was working too hard. It took a long time to get our cups of water and drinks. She accidentally spilled a margarita all over herself and everyone crammed into the little outside spot felt really bad for her. \\n\\nMy margarita, although cheap, was watery and tasted like it was made virgin. We split the chicken fajitas and neither of us liked it. There were NO peppers in it; it was JUST onion. And the chicken tasted like it was seasoned with Old Bay or something (maybe Cajun?), definitely not Mexican flavor. Neither of us ate much and we wanted to leave, but the waitress was overworked so we just kind of awkwardly sat there. The waitress saw we hadn't eaten much and mentioned it was a lot of food (it wasn't...we just didn't enjoy it..). \\n\\nIt seems like there are no good Mexican places around here.

I ended up ordering all the BBQ for the whole group, which I didn't mind doing, but I was a little bit surprised at the prices at first. $13/lb for brisket, $11/lb for ribs & pulled pork. The prices arent ridiculously high, but it was higher than I expected - especially for a \\"trailer\\". While ordering, the owner was very nice, friendly, and very passionate about BBQ. Not only did he offer me a sample of the brisket, he gave me a lot of \\"free\\" stuff like the fatty pieces of brisket, the end pieces of the ribs, etc. I have no problem with the prices if he was going to take care of his customers by only charging for the good parts of the meat. (Also, FWIW, you can order meat plates and sandwiches very pretty reasonable prices).\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, I really can't find anything to complain about. The brisket was moist and flavorful - I'm a big fan of the rub that he used on the brisket. The ribs were tender and well seasoned. The pulled pork had a great balance between meat and fat. \\n\\nEven though the smoked meat was great, one of the most notable things for me was the BBQ sauce. I think our group totally destroyed a bottle of the sweet BBQ sauce. Their espresso BBQ sauce was interesting. I thought it went very well with the ribs. \\n\\nIf you want good BBQ inside the city limits, it doesn't get much better than Franklin.

We ordered, sat down at the counter, and our food arrived shortly afterwards.  I had to ask for ketchup and then shortly after that for napkins.  The female employee put the napkin dispenser up on the top counter for us and then after we took a couple she grabbed it and put it behind the counter in the kitchen area.  \\n\\nAll three employees in the meantime are wiping everything down with bleach water which is the most unappetizing thing to smell while you're trying to eat.  I then had to ask the female employee again for napkins.  I asked if they were about to close as it seemed they were very annoyed and inconvenienced that we were there (and the only customers at the time which I now understand why).  This is horrible, I would never allow my restaurant to be run in this manner where employees think it's okay to essentially close the restaurant well before they actually shut their doors.  We felt so unwelcome there, we ate ask quickly as possible and left our stuff on the counter as they seemed so enthused about their cleaning we decided we may as well let them clean that up as well.  When we exited there was still 21 minutes remaining before they closed.  I was surprised they didn't shove a closed sign in the door as they seemed to be doing everything possible to discourage any customers from coming in.  \\n\\nI don't think I'll be going back as I can find other places to spend my money where I'm not being treated like an annoying inconvenience.

This place has a good selection of burgers and sandwiches and my experiences here were not bad but nothing really special. \\n\\nThe double cheeseburger they have here is pretty good, really liked the flavor of the juicy meat, but what I enjoyed the most about eating this double cheeseburger was the bun. The bun was nice and toasty on the outside, not overly crispy but not rough to chew, and very soft on the inside. One of these double cheeseburgers should be enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. However, eating one double cheeseburger with fries, and you might feel a little funny, and you probably won't be able to \\"speedwalk\\" right after you eat them. \\n\\nBesides the burgers, the fish sandwich they have here is pretty good. Really liked the crispiness and the texture of the fish and the flavor of the cole slaw. They used the same toasted bun as the burgers, which is great. One fish sandwich should be good enough for a decent lunch. \\n\\nAs for the french fries, they were not that great. There was a nice salty flavor, but the texture was mediocre. The lemonade they had here was refreshing but very sweet. Expect to wait 5+ minutes to get your sandwich/burger, so don't expect great service. Atmosphere is a tiny bit grubby, if they could clean the place up better, more people might be able to come. \\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for a decent place to get burgers or a fish sandwich this is not a bad choice.

The hotel suggested this Italian place. Said they delivered but figured I would just go, get said beer or 2 and relax.\\n\\nI will say, I haven't eaten a plate of pasta in over a year. I was looking forward to the shear naughtiness of carb loading and going to bed and then dreaming of running it off. \\n\\nSo, I ordered the baked ziti w grilled chicken. Keep the salad. Give me an ooey gooey plate of pasta. \\n\\nThe server brought \\"garlic knots\\". I ate just one. Meh. It was nice and garlicky (you know...when there's so much garlic it almost burns ?!), the perfect hint of salt and parsley and butter/olive oil. The bread itself just wasn't that good. Dry. It just didn't do the garlic combo any justice. Shame really.\\n\\nPasta, finally. Food coma here I come. Again, meh. In my experience, baked ziti is tossed with sauce and ricotta and baked until the mozz on top is bubbly. This was just a plate full of limp pasta with way too much sauce and some cheese barely melted on top. Totally underwhelming. \\n\\nLet's talk about the sauce for a sec. I guess they make it there. It's too tinny....if that's a word. Metallic may be a better word. I could almost taste the can the tomatoes came out of...not a fan. \\n\\nBack to the dish. I ordered grilled chicken in my pasta and unfortunately I ended up picking it out because it was old and rubbery. Like days old. If not cooked days ago, the chicken itself was old before grilled. Gross. I didn't have the energy to send it back...so I just ordered another beer. \\n\\nThe food was a 2 star experience for sure.

We both loved it.  We had a gift card so we went a little overboard with the amount of food we ordered.  Fried Green Tomatoes were really, really good (can't go wrong with a combo of tomatoes and goat cheese, IMO).  The She-Crab soup is creamy and declicious with chunks of crab in it.  The biscuits and cornbread they bring to the table are as good as any I've ever had; slight edge to the biscuits.  As good as those apps were, the stars of the night were the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and the Shrimp and Grits.  The chicken might have been the best fried chicken we have ever had.  It was that good.  Same the with Shrimp and Grits -- they were thick and creamy, the sauce had just the right amount of spice and the shrimp were perfectly cooked....it was a perfect dish (and I'm a Shrimp and Grits eatin' fool).  I usually eat more food than most people but either entree would have been plenty of food for me, especially if you share an app.  We were both stuffed but we had seen pictures of the Cheesecake Bread Pudding and we weren't leaving there without ordering it.  It was lighter and not as dense as most bread puddings, but after all we had eaten, that was OK by me.

Well, sorta...\\n\\nAlthough it took us a while to find the place (the map in the Yelp app is off by a block...it's behind the Biltmore), Cypress Street Pint and Plate was well worth the trouble.

The marmalade added a nice sweetness to round it out as well.

It was cool how they weren't just slathered with a tomato sauce either.  The Parmesan and Caesar dressing, with the slightly bitter arugula taste, was a slightly different take that worked really well.\\n\\n- Southern Fried Chicken Tender with Fries...$10\\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cypress-street-pint-and-plate-atlanta?select=_Ags98A2sWt80-LySWMVOg#9NaMPoJs3epKMcbZ4q-ITw)\\nAs the menu says, \\"think big\\".  The three tenders were large, moist, and more than enough to satisfy my friend's hankering.  I liked how the batter wasn't very thick around the chicken, but it needed seasoning.  The fries were just okay though, and the honey mustard dipping sauce was pretty pedestrian.\\n\\nGiven our situation, I would have been content just getting something decent to eat.  The fact I got a meal this good though?  Ecstatic, to say the least.  Can't argue with good food, decent prices, friendly service, and a chill yet lively vibe to soak it all in (love the patio/fire pit).  Plus, the beer was cheap (by SF standards) at only $3 or $4 a pint.  Thanks Cypress Street - I don't know if/when I'll be back in Atlanta, but I'll definitely come back again.

It had sweet braised pork belly, chicharon (fried pork rinds), sweet hoisin sauce, gochujang (a Korean spice), and pickled carrots and daikon (commonly found in Vietnamese banh mi).

I'm from Chicago, IL and came to Franklin Barbecue thanks to all the amazing Yelp! reviews. We were not disappointed! We were on a road trip and staying in Austin for a couple of days. The first time we went to Franklin it was around 1 pm in the afternoon we drove past because there was a sign on the door saying they were sold out. WOW! Sold out by 1 pm? That's how you know your good! We knew that we'd have to come back another day because if it's that good I needed to try it! We got up early a couple of days later and arrived around 10 am (knowing they opened at 11 we thought we'd be the firsts in line) Boy were we wrong! There was already a line about a city block long! Holy shitballs this place is the real deal. Everyone in line was super friendly (as we found most of Austin is) so we made conversation about Franklin, his story, and how we ended up in Austin. 11 o'clock rolls around and the doors open....oh mama! The line was slow moving, so be patient...We probably got to order close to 11:45 but boy was it worth it! My mouth is watering just thinking about it...I want to go back so bad! This place is so worth it but be prepared and arrive EARLY! I suggested the Brisket, my friend had the ribs and a year later we still talk about how amazing this place was and how we haven't had anything as good."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"\\"I'd say this was as good as any restaurant brisket I've had.\\" \\n\\nIn Austin this week, I was determined to eat at Franklin's Barbecue. I hadn't been before, but I knew this lunch-only place opens at 11am and closes when they run out of meat. I got there at about 11:38 and there was a long line out the front door that snaked down a walkway into the parking lot. It didn't matter, I was there to eat. After waiting for about 10 or 12 minutes, a woman came around with a notebook asking people what they wanted. She wasn't taking orders, she was telling you whether or not they were likely to have what you wanted by the time you got inside to the carving counter. At that point, still before 12 noon, she said there was no way people at our point in line could get ribs, and it was doubtful there'd be turkey left. Sausage was a maybe. No problem, I was there for brisket and she said there was plenty of that. Then she said it'd be about another hour and 20 minutes before I'd get to the order counter. Thinking \\"Shit!!\\", I said \\"No problem.\\" The line doesn't move quickly. Lucky for me, it was a great weather day. If it's raining, you might wanna skip Franklin's. The lady came back about fifteen minutes later selling soft drinks and beer.\\n\\nSo after very nearly an hour and 20 minutes of standing in the line that runs from outside into and around the periphery of the dining room, taking you past framed articles from local papers, state magazines, and even Bon Appetit (who named Franklin's Best BBQ in the USA in 2010), Franklin's t-shirts, and menus scrawled on paper sacks and duct taped to the concrete block wall, I was within a car length of the chopping blocks. Two young guys were taking orders and serving, another had the register. I noticed a lot of people were getting meat by the pound to go, even though they were having lunch there. The only thing left for us late-comers who got there 20 minutes before noon was brisket, pulled pork, and sausage. As much I was tempted to try all 3, I went with their super star, the beef brisket. I ordered the \\"Plate\\" which comes with 2 sides (potato salad, beans, or slaw). The guy carving had just pulled a fresh one out and I was the second cut on it. He asked me if I wanted lean, fatty, or mixed. I got mixed and also asked him to cut some off the end.\\n\\nThe brisket's served dry. The tables have three bottles of sauce. One's a heavy, dark syrup; one's a thin, light vinegar; and one's a medium tomato-base. All three are distinctive, a bit unlike the usual table sauces. I ate plenty of dry brisket. I should say, though, that the brisket isn't dry; it's moist and falls apart if you try to cut it; very tender. The edges are briny, but not overly. No rare meat. I ate til I was full and had at least half the meat left. I'd say this was as good as any restaurant brisket I've had. The beans and slaw were fine, but definitely not stars. The slaw, btw, is between wet and dry slaw, not too tangy, not too mayonnaisey.\\n\\nFranklin's is lo-fi - paper plates, plastic utensils, styrofoam cups. The building's plain inside and out, probably ugly. The lady who came around outside when I was in line was also the total wait staff inside the dining room. You pay at a register at the end of the line. There's a cooler with some bottled sodas, and also a soft drink dispenser. They have a small but decent beer selection. There's a table with pickles and onions, utensils, napkins, etc. Unless you came with several people, you'll probably sit with strangers. The dining room has 8 tables, and there's a porch out front with a few more. The line moved at just the right pace so that there seemed to always be the right amount of seats. When I left after lunch, there was still a long line.

This place is worth the wait. My bf and I went here last year. This year this was the first place we ate at. Their chicken and waffles is the best we ever had. The waffle is thick and a good compliment to the chicken. The huge portion of chicken is so crispy, full of flavor and the black pepper balances the sweetness of the maple syrup. It even tastes good without proper heating(we used a blow dryer because we're staying at a hotel). The praline bacon comes with 3 strips of thick cut bacon with a sweet glaze. Its breakfast and dessert rolled into one. Bacon with sugar is a win win combo. This is a little sweet if you ate it alone, I recommend eating it with your meal. The oysters egg benedict has perfectly battered oysters. The batter adds an extra element to the oysters. The egg benedict has strips of bacon instead of ham. Everything tasted so good and was reasonably priced."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best barbecue I've had. I went on a Sunday, got in line at about 10:30am, and was able to order around 1:00pm!! (we may have gotten lucky with the wait though) I ordered 1/2 lb of brisket (half moist/half lean) and 1/4 lb of pulled pork. Both were exceptional and well worth the wait and the price. The coffee bbq sauce was excellent as well. I thought the potato salad could have used a little more flavor, but overall, I had a great experience."},{"name":"The Butcherie","address":"428 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"If you need food for Jewish holidays, this is the place to go.

But to be fair, I think it only deserves a 3 1/2. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were visiting Austin for the 4th of July holiday weekend and we wanted to taste real homemade barbecue. We asked around for recommendations and were told that Stubb's was a must-try. \\n\\nMy boyfriend was craving ribs - they were giant and the meat literally fell right off the bone. However, they were a bit too charred for my boyfriend's taste. The side of mac and cheese was definitely homemade and real! We both had the sweet potato fries and they were delish! I had the smoked turkey and pulled pork. The turkey was so incredibly tender! The pulled pork was amazing! It was marinated in something much sweeter than their regular BBQ sauce. It was the best pulled pork I've ever eaten! For dessert, we shared the peach cobbler. My boyfriend isn't a fan of warm fruit desserts, but we both really enjoyed the cobbler! \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I weren't amazed by Stubb's BBQ sauce. It was too tangy for our liking and to be honest reminded me slightly of A1 steak sauce. To end on a brighter note, Stubb's was open on the 4th of July which was great since we were leaving Austin the next day. And we were given a lot of food for what we paid, which was great for our wallets."},{"name":"The Reef","address":"4172 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Long story short, ridiculously good  eats, but wack service. People say its because of the laid back lifestyle in the Caribbean, but its really because the servers and kitchen crew are spread thin.

I will note that it was a little difficult to find Soulfire as there was no sign visible when looking down Harvard Avenue from the T stop.  So we wandered a bit not sure which way to continue walking.\\n\\nWe tried Soulfire based on the Yelp reviews (especially the fried mac and cheese recommendations).  Well, our experience was a disappointment.  This should have been foreshadowed based on there only being two other patrons indoors on a Friday; a little eerie.  You would think that people would at least be there to drink.\\n\\nWe started with the aforementioned appetizer.  Although claiming to be \\"extra cheesy,\\" the fried mac and cheese bites were anything but cheesy.  At the least, I would question Soulfire's interpretation of the word \\"extra\\" nevermind \\"cheesy.\\"  They were most definitely dry, as if made with noodles and powdered cheese sans the milk and butter required.  Disappointing.\\n\\nThe sides were a mixed bag.  The collard greens were too sweet for me, and it is noted that the menu claims as much.  I would have preferred equal parts sweet and salty, though.  The pickles were mediocre and nothing to remember or to crave at a later date.  The potato salad was also on the sweet side, which is likely do to the use of red bliss potatoes and not enough salt.  The one interesting and good side was the coleslaw.  It is truly palate-cleansing as the menu states.  Oddly, I kept craving more and more of it.\\n\\nFor the main meal, I had the brisket platter, and my husband had the spare ribs.  The brisket was the worst that I have ever had.  It was so dry and brought to mind trying to chew shoe leather.  I really could not believe how dry it was and how they were trying to pass it off as beef brisket.  Again, this could be why I was continually eating the palate-cleansing coleslaw!  Maybe not so odd, afterall.\\n\\nOn a better note, my husband thought that the spare ribs were good, not great, but good nonetheless.  Our waitress was extremely nice and sweet; too bad the sides matched her persona.  \\n\\nTake it from two people who have lived in Texas:  save your pennies and spend them elsewhere.  This one's a dud!"},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Best bar--b-q I've ever had in my life hands down. The brisket and ribs are amazing and melt in your mouth. The sides are good as well, but the meat is really all you need. Every meat I've tried here has been amazing, so get ready to embrace your inner carnivore if you dine here. Great for parties or intimate dinners. The drinks are pretty good but I tend to stick the beer here. The Fritos Pie is a must have if you're a native Georgian and fondly remember this southern delicacy.

They have a wide selection of wine, beer, and cocktails, appetizers, pasta, pizza, entrees, etc. I decided to order pizza. I ordered the al salmone. This pizza has a complexity of flavors and textures--the smokiness of the smoked salmon, the earthiness of the truffle, and the creaminess of the goat cheese.

It's basically my backyard, so we used to frequent often...like, too often. But now, it's a miracle to find any open seat. People basically sit on top of each other in the patio, and if you find anything inside you have to scream across the table to hear anything (go there on a trivia night and you'll never hear again). It's now the cool place to go for big groups of yuppies and frat kids. And with all the new staff, the service and food quality has gone way down. Last time I waited about 10+ minutes (in what was an unusually not filled patio) and never got a waiter so I left. Their once $9 sublime burger is now a $14 burger, and while it's delicious I have to have a really strong craving to wrestle the crowds and make it worth the experience.

There were so many options that sounded good, it was really difficult to commit to only 3, but I went with jambalaya, a pork chop, and collard greens. The food was amazing and everyone around the table got something different but all with the same rave reviews. The service was also very good despite the Friday night rush.\\n\\nIf I have one regret, it's that I didn't save room for dessert.
