I love lobster rolls.\\n\\nI came here on a mission. To try the lobster roll. \\n\\nI had to pull some strings to get here for lunch on a weekday, since lunch is not offered here on weekends.\\n\\nFirst of all, let me say. I do like this place. How do you dislike some place called The Optimist? The name alone counts as a star for me =)\\n\\nMy friend and I arrived. Immediately impressed by the location and decor inside. It is absolutely beautiful. What a wide open, inviting, gorgeous space. You do feel you are almost seaside somewhere...\\n\\nOur server arrived, and she was very nice. We both knew we wanted to get the lobster roll, and it came out within minutes.\\n\\nNow, I am comparing this lobster roll to the one that I absolutely love at Legal Sea Foods in Atlanta.\\n\\nSide by side comparison:\\n\\nPortion size? Legal wins it. It is double the size of Optimist's.\\n\\nPrice? Legal is market price. I think I might have paid 20 bucks or so last time. The Optimist's is $17. (Must have recently raised the price as some Yelpers have been saying $14.) BUT, it is half the size. Overall better value? Legal.\\n\\nBread? Legal. I prefer their brioche. My one today at Optimist was burnt black on one side, and was a bit reminiscent of a hotdog bun.\\n\\nLobster quality? Toss-up. You can tell both establishments use nothing but the highest quality.\\n\\nLobster portion? Legal. Hands-down. Huge chunks of lobster. Whole claw meat. Made Optimist look really skimpy.\\n\\nOverall flavor? Legal. I prefer the lobster to shine in my lobster rolls. At Optimist, I tasted celery first, then the lobster. I did really like Optimist's tartar sauce, however. Extremely lemon-limey, a nice bright kick to enhance the lobster.\\n\\nSides? Legal. Absolutely. This is personal preference, but I like hearty, thick-cut fries. That I can dip in things. Optimist's shoestring fries weren't doing it for me. Very greasy. Had to eat them with a fork. Seasoned perfectly though.\\n              Also, Legal serves an extra side with their lobster roll. So, that alone kind of pushes them ahead in the \\"sides\\" game. I always get the stone-ground grits (delish), but they've got a ton of side choices.\\n\\n\\nI will say though, Optimist's service is STELLAR. I was almost entirely through with my roll and was perfectly happy finishing it as is. Our server came by to ask how everything was, and I said everything was great, but my bun was a little toasty. She asked me if I wanted a new one, and I said absolutely not, I am almost done.\\n\\nFast forward 2 minutes, and a gentleman brings me a new plate with a new roll. Tells me he wants my experience to be the best it can be.\\n\\nSo, as far as service, both Optimist and Legal are completely on par. Great job all around.\\n\\nWill come back to the Optimist for sure. Their dinner menu looks great. And the desserts sounded scrumptious.\\n\\nWill just choose Legal for my lobster roll fix, but I am super glad I tried Optimist's version."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3747 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I go by the one set to open on SE Division, and I dream of that day you be closer to my hangouts.  \\n\\nYour brioche buns = a star.

For drinks we had a red wine blend which was beautiful, the strawberry fields and the up in smoke drink- both amazing. For dinner we had the strip steak which was cooked to perfection, so juicy and the sides were creamy mashed potatoes with green beans I couldn't stop stealing bites from the hubby. We also had the scallops with tomato grits, it was perfectly prepared and not over cooked or dry as most people can mess up a scallop. \\n\\nNot only was the food good the service was fab, they recommend a few drinks and food options and took the time to explain a few things to us. We enjoyed every single bite and I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in Atlanta.

If you're ever looking for a place to stay in Portland, this converted elementary school will not disappoint. The school was built in the early 1900's and closed in the 1970's. Apparently, it sat empty and neglected, until McMenamins took it over and infused the place was equal parts cool, whimsy and pure genius.\\n\\nEach guest room is half of a former classroom, complete with old-school coat closet and blackboard. We stayed in the \\"Broom Basket\\" room, which is decorated with a hand-painted nursery rhyme motif. The room did get a bit drafty at night, but the high ceiling and massive windows gave us some spectacular light when we pulled the drapes open in the morning.\\n\\nThere aren't any TV's in the rooms, but you won't need one. There's a theater in the school that shows first run movies. There are also a number of bars in the place, each serving beer that is brewed on the premises. I liked the Boiler Room, which is located in--what else?--the old boiler room. The bar is decorated with old pipes, valves and radiators; welded together to form an all-encompassing sculpture. Very steampunk. Very cool. Excellent pub grub, too.\\n\\nThere's something completely awesome about being able to bar hop, guzzle a boatload of beer, and sleep it off without even leaving the building. I must say the beer was pretty tasty, too. I thoroughly enjoyed the IPA and the Terminator Stout. The brewery is located in what was once the pink-tiled girl's restroom.\\n\\nOn our last night, we stumbled upon a group of Shape Note singers practicing in one of the meeting rooms. We sat in and enjoyed their wonderful demonstration of The Sacred Harp. You see, The Kennedy School is not just a hotel, but the social hub of the neighborhood.

So today, I finally got the chance to visit and boy oh boy...was I ever disappointed. \\n\\nUpon arriving at the restaurant, my friends and I stood by the door for a good five minutes before we were even greeted. The restaurant was 10% full, with 4-5 waiters on floor. I do not understand why it took so long for them to greet and seat us. \\n\\nAfter we sat down, the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink and we said water. Their facial expression immediately changed and looked rather disappointed. They continued to ask us several times whether we wanted to drink something else other than water. Most of the time when we were talking to the waitress, she was looking at something else - not once did she ever look at us in the face. Whenever we asked her a question, she replied back with a snarky remark. Oh and attentive service? I don't think so.\\n\\nThe food was average- I have tried way better pasta in Vancouver. It did not take long for it to arrive - which was good. When we asked for a box to pack up the food, the waiter said sure and continued to take our plates away, stacking the dirty plates on top of the food we wanted to pack. Seriously? Way to make our food dirty. Why are you stacking the used plates on top of the food that we JUST asked to pack it? This once again proves that AFL has horrible service. \\n\\nBy now, my friends and I were looking at each other in disbelief - how can the service be this bad? We felt like we were looked down upon for just wanting to order water or wanting to pack the food to go or something. I'm sorry we wanted to be healthy and just get water! \\n\\nClearly, we did not give them a lot of tips but still decent like 15%. While we were paying, we tried talking to the waitress (like strike up a casual conversation, ya know? so its not so awkward) but she seemed very fake...like only replying to us and acting friendly to get a bigger tip. After the waitress saw the receipt and the tip, she said very sarcastically...\\"Well THANK YOU so much\\" and left. Bad service? Sorry you don't deserve a big tip! \\n\\nOverall thoughts: I do not understand why this place got so much attention and awards. I have worked in media and I know that restaurants who know people in the media definitely get more exposure and reviews. It is possible that they used their connections to get media attention. \\n\\nIf you know someone that works at AFL, you definitely get seated faster and better/friendlier service.\\n\\nWill I return? No. Not worth the wait, the food, or the service."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Tolerated it for friends birthday. \\n\\nWent to a birthday party there for my friend who loves the place.  We were seated rather quickly as she had reservations.  The place was balmy hot so they had plug-in fans running to move the warm air around.  This added to the loud noise of the place.  The fan near where I was sitting had a click to it so it sounded somewhat like an air compressor running beside our table through the course of the evening.  Then add to that everyone talking extremely loud trying to be heard.  I was seated on long rickety bench that is attached to the wall. It was rather uncomfortable.    The server was pretty good for the most part and his  prevailing attitude when a question or comment was made was \\"You are fortunate to be here in our super-trendy restaurant, so sorry if you don't like it but we wont change anything\\".   I am working the Dave Ramsey plan so in an effort to keep cost down I ordered only the Ravioli $10.00.  The four flat raviolis were pretty bland with sweet cherry tomatoes and crunchy English peas over them -- not sure how those conflicting flavors got shuffled together but that is a taste preference so I will give them a pass on that. I did not like it -- I was hungry and couldn't make myself finish the tiny dish.  (I had to eat when I got home.) The food was brought to the table very rapidly and that was a positive.  I received my bill: the Raviolis were $10.80 with tax and the gratuity was $8.82 -- 82% of the bill - wow.   The server said they divide the gratuity equally across all of the people in the party -- so how nice, I get to subsidize the gratuity for the others at the table... bite my tongue...

I can say like this because I am a Southeast Asian native and I can rate good Thai food like Austinians do to Mighty Fine Burgers, Salt Lick BBQ, Rudy's, etc that are really great. \\nAlthough Madam Mam's menu may be a lot and sometimes I don't know what to pick and the food that I choose turns out to be just fine, their foods no doubt are way better than Thai Noodle's, especially Pad See Ew. You may wanna try it in Thai Noodle but I am very sure that you won't come back after taste it in Madam Mam's. Besides, it costs one dollar more in Thai Noodle (I've compared the price). So basically the food in this place in my opinion is lacking spices and just simply plain and boring. After eating there I felt like going to my kitchen and cooking by my self. I never learned how to cook but tasting the food reminded me of the food that I managed to cook somehow. The positive thing was just getting full because I don't want to waste it.\\n\\n2. The service was rude \\nI was eating alone that day. I called my friend and talked to her. My voice was small and I did not disturb anyone. There were also 3 pairs of customers in other tables. They were having lunch while talking to each other. The manager or the old lady that was there (I guess she was the boss) placed the bill on the table as soon as the meal was served (in my point of view, it was kind of rude because  you usually give the bill later or when people have finished eating). Next, she came to me while I was talking in the phone and eating. She asked me if I needed a box, and I said to her,\\"No, thanks\\" because I was still eating the food and the plate was still full. At that point, I was disturbed. I mean, anyone could ask if they needed a box. The way she approached me made an impression that she wanted me to leave the restaurant as fast as possible (it was a bad way to treat a customer). And then, even though I said 'No' because I wanted to finish the meal there, she still put the empty box on my table. I got upset but kept quiet in front of other customers. I decided to give a small tip based on what I have experienced. Can you guess what happened next? The boss chased me and demanded the tip must be 10%\\". I mean, I am very aware about that. So I explained to her that the service was quite rude to me. I was unwilling to give more than what I had written. But her reply was \\"you don't come back!\\".I was surprised because I should be the person to say that, so I said  to her \\"sure\\".  I would not want to be treated like that next time. Honestly if the food is yummy, I would still come back and order to go, but they just fall below the standard of a nice restaurant. So I'd rather go to places like Pluckers or Sushi Nichi, worth it. Even Thai Noodles is close to where I live, I'd rather eat somewhere else, far but good food and service."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"They were able to squeeze me in at the bar on a cold & rainy Austin night where I was welcomed by the warmth of the wood fire burning in the brick oven and a greeting by the bartender.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed that the only beer they served was Peroni, but it's fine with any Italian dish I suppose.\\n\\nStarted out with grilled beets for an appetizer, delicious.

The queue was already long but tbh our day plans were put on hold due to the rain and so we figured why not join the queue. We spent about 30 minutes outside and then inside the queue continued for about another 35/40 around the restaurant until you eventually reach the the counter where food is prepared and served, which is where you order. I was not aware of this second queue and tbh probably would not have started queuing should I have known about it. However, it doesn't give you PLENTY of time to decide what you want. \\n\\nMy friend and I decide to share two plates, the avocado sunrise which is an open sandwhich consisting of avocado, bacon, egg and sriracha served with home fries.

I'm not a beer drinker, but I wanted to experience the German beer garden concept and the UYE was a great way to do it.  \\n\\nThe garden is a great space.  It's not very large but the space is more than adequate for medium sized groups - 6-8 people.  There are a few lawn games placed surrounding the picnic table areas, but most people seemed content to drink, eat and communion.  (Corny but fitting.)  \\n\\nAs a non-beer drinker, I was prepared to drink one beer but lucky me, Communion serves both cocktails and punches.  The punch I had was a basil lemonade vodka concoction that was a bit sweet for me but better than beer, so I'm not complaining.  It was also only 1 ticket for a full glass compared to 2 tickets for a regular sized beer so liquor drinkers are winning in this instance.\\n\\nAs my food snack, I had the pretzel.  The pretzel itself was delicious and perfect, crisp and thin outside and fluffy inside.  The cheese that accompanied the pretzel was bland but did have a wonderful creamy, almost whipped consistency that I liked.  \\n\\nThe dish that blew my mind were the beer fries with wieners/sausages that were covered with dark sauce.  I have no idea what I was eating because someone else ordered it but it tasted so, so good and the wieners/sausages had a firm texture that I was oh-so-very-happy with.  If you get nothing else, get this, and I'm sorry that I can't be more clear about what it was.  \\n\\nA lot of other reviewers complained about the prices, but I can tell that the food is quality and it also makes sure that your wait staff is well-compensated.  That being said, it's a pricey place to have a beer and a snack, so I can see the customer turnover being high after a few people drop $20 and only get 1 beer and a basket of fries.  This could lead to Communion not having regular customers, and I don't know how long a business can stay open without people supporting it after the new-ness of it wears off.  \\n\\nYelp 100 #33"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only been here once when I was visiting Portland but I have to share the experience I had on that one visit.\\n\\nOkay I'll cut right to the chase...there was a COCKROACH in the doughnut case!!!

Well, who doesn't except for food Nazi Vegans, and other non-meat eaters. I checked out Little Big Burger on the web, and saw they had a couple of locations. The parking and access issues of the Pearl district made the Mississippi Ave location the location of choice. \\n\\nMississippi Avenue looks a lot like the Pearl before the big money started pouring in. I guess you can say it's the new Pearl, lots of folks with dogs around here, oh how very Portland. \\n\\nSo once in the Little Big burger, I get the feeling the building used to be a car repair place. But then again it could simply be styled that way as that is kind of the trendy thing to do now days. \\n\\nThe menu is simple, but also somewhat complex. The menu on the wall says Hamburger, Cheeseburger, but there are a number of options. I ultimately ordered a Cheeseburger with bacon and Blue Cheese, and the much-vaunted fries.\\n\\nMy order came up in a short period of time. It came in a brown paper bag. A lot of similarities to Five Guys here, but the similarities are only on the surface. The difference in the products are huge, and in entirely different leagues. \\n\\nFirst the fries; the first bite, tasted a bit off, after years of eating fries, these tasted slightly different, a very subtle flavor, but the truffle oil is definitely playing in the flavor. After about 5 fries, they stopped tasting weird and started tasting so good that I couldn't stop eating them until they were gone. I tried a little of the \\"Camden Ketchup\\", but found that just salt on them really kept that truffle flavor pouring in. I should have gone next door to \\"The Meadows\\" and bought some Maldon Salt, or Fleu de sel to put on them, they just seemed to deserve some high-end salt. I think next time I will tell them to hold the salt on the fries, and do just that.\\n\\nNow for the burger; the size of the burger is bigger than what would be a \\"White Castle\\" slider, but smaller in diameter than a standard burger.  However, in height they are almost too big to fit easily into the mouth. You have to open wide to get it all in. The patty while smallish is pretty thick. The toppings are fresh and good. The bun fresh and tastes great.\\n\\nWe don't have the most desirable \\"In-N-Out\\" burger up here, and I doubt we ever will, but Little Big Burger subs in nicely for a gourmand offering of the simple and quality burger place that draws me to the places like \\"In-N-Out\\".\\n\\nPrices seemed high, but once again quality of ingredients reflects the price structures. Service was fairly strait-forward, you order, you pay, and they call your number.  \\n\\nFrom the comments from my lunch circle is that we want to put this place on rotation meaning we will come back in the near future. The distance and parking around the area makes for a longer lunch than a place with a dedicated parking lot and a bit closer to our office.

This is why you need to look for subtleties to find where the real gems are.  There are a couple of things that make any Pizzeria stand out with sauce and crust being the two biggest.   After that,  it is basically cheese, veg and and sliced meat which it is relatively easy to get creative around.  Pinthouse pairs many great flavors and interesting combinations like on the Honey Pear which has sliced pear, caramelized onions, blue cheese, prosciutto, basil, local honey.  While these are fun and delicious, I personally tend to gravitate to the classics.  \\n\\nSo why get something that can be easily copied?  Isn't a Pepperoni pizza a Pepperoni pizza?  No, it is not and in the this case, the Pepperoni and Basil was a true stand out for Pizzas in general. First off,  the sauce.  In most cases the tangier the better but for Pinthouse they went a little more on the sweet side with their house red.  As you chew, the basil flavors layer into the slightly sweet sauce to create a new kind of tang.  It is crisp and creates a fresh take on the what you might take fro granted if you weren't paying attention.  As you continue to chew, the Pepperoni oils spread that flavor across the rest of your palate.  \\n\\nNow for the crust.  I personally think that for a thin crust pizza, this is the MOST overlooked component. \\n\\nQUIZ..  \\"I'll take cornmeal for $100.00\\" What do they put on the bottom of the pizzas so that they doesn't stick to the oven or pan?.   \\n\\nBack to the crust.  Think back to the time that you actually \\"tasted\\" the crust.  It really complimented the pizza and more then just a delivery mechanism, it helps create a complete experience including what is on top of it.  But WAIT,  the crust isn't actually a secrete Pinthouse thing,  it is a local company called Smart Flour which produces gluten free products and specifically, crusts.  This begs the question,  why doesn't Pinthouse make their own?  Well,  If you know you can serve your customers the BEST possible product by using someone else's crust with your know how and toppings,  then why not.  It is the best Pizza for your customer and that is part of the DNA of Pinthouse.  The very best pizza and beer server in a casual environment.  \\n\\nThe last thing that I really love about this place is their beer.  So you mix artisan pizza with artisan beer and you had some that is truly unique.   They have at least 10 on-premise crafted brews on tap ranging from the Dank IPAs to mellow sours and some phenomenal stouts.   In fact,  they are SO special that after writing this, I now have a hankerin for an IPA and am going to drive the 25 minutes just for 1 beer.  In fact,  the beer alone is so special that even if they served frozen Tortino's I would still give them 5 stars.

The sweet and sour sauce on the side was clearly purchased and not made in-house.\\n\\nOther weird thing about the experience. I called for takeout at about 8:30 when the restaurant closes at 9. They told me 20 minutes, so I showed up at 8:50. When I walked in, someone in the kitchen groaned and said something I couldn't understand. Then the person staffing the register said that it was okay, she told them I was just picking up an order. She then said that people who come in right before closing always stay forever. Honestly, if you don't want people coming into your restaurant after 8:30, then list your closing hours as 8:30 or say last seating at 8:30 on your website.

For me, it meant so much more than just greasy burgers and fries served by a tall, lipstick wearing, strawberry blonde man in a yellow prison jumpsuit. To me, McDonald's represented everything that my life on the farm wasn't. McDonalds was far reaching, with restaurants across the globe. McDonald's was fun, with playgrounds and meals designed specifically for children. McDonald's was educational, with placemats that contained puzzles and games. I would double-up on my Ritalin and attack those puzzles like a rabid polecat. To me, McDonald's represented progress.\\n\\nThat is, until I started working in Chinatown, at which point McDonald's began to represent damnation, like ma and pa had warned me. While Chinatown has certainly improved in recent years, the corner of Kneeland and Washington has remained the epicenter of all that is shady about this neighborhood. Things that I have witnessed in and around McDonald's include extensive drug sale and use. There are resident dealers and the addicts who beg for (or sometimes demand) change in the McDonald's dining room. This is one of the reasons why the staff at McDonald's limits bathroom use to paying customers, because it was relatively common for users to get whacked out in the bathroom before passing out in the dining room. It's so appealing to eat lunch next to someone who is face-down in a puddle of drool and puke. Then, there are the pimps and hoes who visit McDonald's to satisfy their hunger pangs, though once I observed one satisfying the other under a table. Lastly, there are the other petty criminal elements, such as gangbangers, pickpockets, and thugs. These individuals have a lesser presence now than before, but they are none-the-less dangerous when they appear.\\n\\nPart of McDonald's appeal is its familiarity across geographic and cultural boundaries. However, nothing about the Chinatown McDonald's feels familiar to me. Chinatown, in all its infinite shadiness, manages to render this icon of American hospitality into something hostile and (at times) confrontational. Their management and the Boston Police have tried to mitigate this situation the best that they can, with some level of success. However, there will be no return to innocence for me, as I have seen too much already. As I walk past McDonald's on my way to and from work, listening to MP3s in order to avoid direct communication/confrontation with whoever has taken up residence on the street corner outside, I hear Pink Floyd lyrics reverberating in my ear buds - words about childhood's end and (youthful) fantasies merging with harsh realities. The lure of a quick and cheap fix of fat and artificial flavoring has lost its appeal to me, and so I keep walking."},{"name":"Don Dario's","address":"8801 S I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Fantastic Service - the waitstaff remembers you and your particulars re. preferences; they are attentive and flexible.

I was not happy to see a dried red Thai chili pepper as a garnish, but it seemed to only notch up the heat not take over the jalape√±o flavor. We also ordered the red sangria, I am not a fan of red wine so they let me sample it first and it was the best sangria I've had in my life. (Maybe not saying much from someone who doesn't like red wine, but seriously a delicious beverage). Then, my hubby and I like to share because everyone serves way too much, and who wants to do that to themselves, so we ordered the lobster Mac n cheese and the lobster fried rice. DEAR GOD! They were both awesome! The Mac n cheese had a lovely hint of heat and the warmth of a touch of nutmeg and just and outstanding combo of pasta, lobster and cheese. Then the lobster fried rice comes with a dramatic fried lobster tail on top of the bed of veggies and rice.  This dish was also bringing a nice bit of heat. We decided that the desserts were too impressive to skip so we only ate half of each the app and entree (did I mention the lobster Mac n cheese was an appetizer?) and ordered the coconut key lime cake (flavors, not necessarily the title) and dove in to this cake of amazing stature. We left full, carrying 3 take out boxes and about $100 in for the night.

We went in on a Wednesday evening and as there was a chill, we sat indoors.  There are also seats out back and I could see that on a nice spring evening they will be the preferred place to sit.  \\n\\nA few tables were filled with regulars, and the owner was doing double duty as waitress.  The atmosphere reminded me of some of those small cafes in Europe or Argentina, relaxed and comfortable.  It is obvious this place reflects the style and choices of the owner.  It was a refreshing change from what you see now in too many parts of Austin and that suited me just fine.  I think that is what I like about east Austin; there is a relaxed style that reminds me of Austin 15 years ago.  \\n\\nThe menu was simple, with sandwiches, salads, and cheese plates holding top billing and a few more substantial dinner entrees rounding out the selections.  The wine list is brief, with the major varietals are represented with one or two choices.  What it lacks in selection, it makes up for in value, with nothing above 30 dollars and a few good choices around 20.  We started with a cheese plate, which was enormous and would do well as a meal.  We enjoyed this with a bottle of wine.  I had a salad and my friend had the tuna.  Both were equally generous portions and did not leave any room for desert.  \\n\\nA very nice evening, like a time machine back to Austin in the late 80's or early 90's...before the boom when Austin was not trying to be something other than what it really is."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Yelp, you need to change the hours of operation you have listed on Grindhouse.

The chefs prepare the dishes in front of customers. The kitchen itself is mostly open, so the sounds of cooking etc are part of the ambient noise of the restaurant, which can become too much at times. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is incredibly small, and the \\"waiting area\\" is often so packed as to be extremely uncomfortable. Tables are rather close to one another, and half of the seats available are at the bar or counter, rather than at tables. It's difficult to appreciate the mostly wooden decor when it's packed, and everyone is trying not to run into each other. \\n\\nMENU (4/5):\\nThere's a good selection of ramen dishes as well as appetizers and items that aren't ramen. My favorite is the Jinya Black for ramen or the pork chasu bowl for a non-ramen dish. The dishes can be expensive, but it's the only Japanese ramen place around town with variety. \\n\\nWhile none of the menus online seem to have calorie counts, the menu in the actual restaurant does. :) Most of the items come to 1000 Calories or so, which is fair for a meal out. \\n\\nFLAVOR (5/5):\\nThe food is really rich and full of good flavor, without being complicated. There's quite a bit of customization that can also go into a bowl, but the overall taste of each dish is cohesive nonetheless. \\n\\nSERVICE (4/5): \\nJinya is really, really, really cramped. And quite busy. Despite all this, I've always found that the waiters and waitresses are attentive, fast, and accurate, with the rare exception of a couple of incidents.\\n\\nLarge parties beware. There is no reservation by phone. You come and pray that something becomes available. \\n\\nLOCATION (2/5):\\nI've been to Jinya quite often now to the point of becoming a somewhat regular customer. Despite this, I've only sat down in the restaurant a handful of times. Jinya is almost always busy. Even during off times, the wait can be 25-30 minutes long. I simply just order take-out now. \\n\\nEven worse, the parking is absolutely terrible. Jinya is located in a rather busy plaza, in the increasingly busy city of Sandy Springs.

The corn dogs were cool, but I think they must use a pre-done, Sysco-like dough for the empinadas, because the flavor was dull and heavy. Also, the portion was as huge as they duck entree we got! The duck was ok, but the sausage was dry and there was a citrus scent to the apple that wasn't quite right, as if they attempted to keep the apple from browning by using the citrus in the prep.

Rolls are affordable and there's an extensive menu of special rolls. I'm a huge sucker for those meaning I stared at the menu for a long time before finally deciding. The special rolls we ended up trying were the Crispy Tatsu Roll and the Sunset Roll. \\n\\nI'll get my only real big negative out of the way first and it's that some of the special rolls seem a bit too ambitious. The Sunset Roll was just full of stuff. There was definitely at least scallops and smoked salmon. Just too much stuff in one roll to handle at once. Not a fan of when rolls get too ambitious and you can't have it all in that one bite.\\n\\nOtherwise, food was delicious and great. Takoyaki was nice and hot to eat. The special rolls were still good overall despite their cumbersomeness. Much preferred the Crispy Tatsu Roll as I enjoy having the shredded bits on top.

If this pizza was served in a strip mall off the highway instead of in its tragically hip SOCO location, I seriously doubt it would enjoy the kind of business it pulls in from the sidewalk tourist crowd. The place is very cool looking. The interior and exterior fit the Austin scene perfectly, but this pizza is incredibly bland. The crust is flavorless. The cheese does not make your taste buds crave each bite and the toppings are just meh, especially when they attempt an east coast specialty like a white clam pie.  I'm sorry, but your clams are not fresh, Home Slice. And your garlic has no punch.  Even standard fare pepperoni leaves your foodie desires unfulfilled. Anyone in Austin who wants their mouths to water in the very anticipation of eating pizza should wander over to East Side Pies on Rosewood Ave for a truly authentic New York pizza.  No, East Side Pies is not situated on a cool drag full of funky shops, bars and shopping, but your belly will be so much happier for the experience.

The coffee flowed freely, the service was attentive.

My husband and I decided to share several tapas rather than order entrees.  Our waitress was very helpful in guiding us on what to order and she was so right.

It was served with a section of corn on the cob and a piece of cooked yam.  I hate yams but the fish eaten together with the yam and corn was very tasty.  The waitress suggested 5 tapas to share which ended up being the perfect amount of food.  The restaurant's atmosphere is a nice combination of formal and comfortable; the service is friendly, very professional and polished.

Andina's featured a special menu to celebrate love, and my husband and I were happy to join the celebration.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, the service was flawless.  I have a lot of food allergies, but I'm good a maneuvering a menu without being annoying.  Our server asked if we had allergies, so I confessed but had ordered around them--asparagus and salmon.  They changed the prep on the salmon to avoid the panko crust and brought out fried yuca to replace the bread.  \\n\\nEverything tasted amazing, and it was refreshing to sample the yuca in the mint jalape√±o dipping sauce separate from my husband's dipping sauce for his bread.  Normally, I just sip something while my dining partners enjoy the bread or crackers or whatever allergen is served.  Tonight was different, and it felt wonderful.  Plus, my husband got to taste yuca for the first time, and he preferred it over the bread.\\n\\nMy salmon was perfectly prepared, and the sauces that accompanied it made it sing.  I was getting pretty full--the asparagus was enough for three servings--so I didn't eat the potatoes (yuca is filling, too).  Tom said the potatoes from my plate were good but his mashed and then fried, seared potatoes that accompanied his rack of lamb were amazing.  He also had an empanada for his first course that was light, flavorful and reset his expectations for dining excellence.\\n\\nIt was a valentine dinner, so dessert factored in.  The chocolate brownie included egg and wheat, so I had the lavender lemon sorbet.  Tom said both were good, and they paired well.  I had coffee instead--dessert isn't my thing, but the coffee was a beautiful close to an extraordinary evening.\\n\\nI'm including a few photos, which are a bit dark.  I couldn't bring myself to use a flash in Andina's romantic setting (we were upstairs, and the space was beautiful).  Eventually, I didn't want to take photos either--Yelpers have posted plenty.

It's important to note that they normally serve a standard Sunday brunch in the low $40s, but since it was \\"Easter Sunday,\\" they had a special menu at an increased rate of $65.  I'm Jewish and I think requiring every patron to pay an increased fee due to a religious holiday is absurd.  I would have appreciated the option of ordering off the regular menu, but I digress since I was being treated.  That being said, I was SHOCKED to see how many children were there dining and figure there must have been a children's menu???\\n\\nThe prix fix menu offered 4 courses.  I was surprised to see that although there were 4 courses, the portions were by no means small. After we ordered, we were served a small plate of pastries in lieu of bread.  Not knowing that, I ordered the beignets as my starter and I'm not exaggerating when I say I received a bowl of SIX beignets (refer to the picture I posted), which I opted to share with my table.  For the second course I ordered the shrimp gnocchi carbonara style -- it came with 3 large shrimp and some interesting gnocchi type dumpling things (I've posted a picture of this as well).  Not my favorite, but I ate the shrimp which was more than enough.  For my third/main course I ordered the flat iron steak with fries.  At that point, I was pretty full and only had a few bites, opting to pack up the leftovers.  By the time dessert came out I was completely stuffed so tried a bite and ended up packing that up as well.\\n\\nWe ordered some bloody Marys, but they came out warm and required a good stir to mix up the ingredients and cool down the liquid. \\n\\nI would not return for a holiday brunch, but I might be interested in trying the regular Sunday brunch next time I'm looking to splurge in the area.

Reminded me of some of the oysters I have had at Hog Island in San Francisco. Most definitely the freshest oysters I have had in the south. So good! Host came and told us when we were halfway through our oysters that our table was ready. But she did not rush us and allowed us to finish and enjoy our oysters at the bar. Great host! \\n\\nAfter the oysters we found our host and she seated us immediately at our table. We were served dinner rolls right away, they were basted in butter and topped off with sea salt. Simple, fresh, and delicious! Then we ordered the octopus appetizer and it was the most tender I have ever had. Cutting through it felt like butter! Effortless! And the red sauce that accompanied it reminded me of arrabbiata sauce from an Italian restaurant. Had a nice kick and flavor that accompanied the octopus very well. Absolutely delectable! \\n\\nThen for our entrees, my wife had the scallops while I opted for the grouper. Both were extraordinary, melt in your mouth goodness! We also had the basmati rice and broccolini to accompany our meals. Both were excellent. \\n\\nAnd just when I thought it could not get any better, we ended our night with the banoffee pudding cake... and that has got to be one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life!

I would of never known it being associated as a seafood restaurant first glance. But after my experience, I can see why the owners decided on the name.

There were about 5 that was I was torn between.  I asked my sweet and sassy server Lola for her suggestion on drinks and she led me in the right direction based on what I had a taste for.  I went with the grape smash and then followed up with some other cocktail whose name escapes me but it had pear in it.  Both drinks were spot on, again, based on what I read in he descriptions.  For apps, we started with the seafood rolls (think eggroll stuffed with minced seafood) which was good but don't get it if you do not want fried food.  For entrees we had the red grouper Thai curry and the fried chicken.  Both dishes along with their sides were amazing!\\n\\nOverall, I'll definitely be back at this place.

If you're in there for the first time, they give you a small cup of pot likker, which is the juice from the greens flavored with all the swell stuff cooked with it. I ordered fried oysters and two sides: cheese and vegetable souffle and fried green tomatoes, the latter of which I've never had despite seeing the movie and reading the book by the same name. The plateful of oysters I got looked as if they'd raided every bed in the Atlantic, and both sides were delicious. I also ordered a mint julep, which I'd never had either. Eh. Not their fault--apparently, mint juleps are sugar water with a little bit of a kick.

I usually go with the orange chicken, and if you put a blindfold on me and asked me to say which was Garden Cafe's orange chicken and which was an omnivore's orange chicken, I'd be stumped. It's really good. If you have vegan friends or family, this is totally a satisfactory place to eat together and have both parties be satisfied.\\n\\nThe decor is kind of blah, but I won't hold that against them. It's simple, and the food speaks for itself. The service is always friendly, and they're usually open on holidays. Each time I've eaten here, they weren't that crowded, but don't let that fool you. Low attendance doesn't always equal bad food. This is a great place to go to when you want a quiet evening out.\\n\\nSo, vegans, this place is great for you.

This area has free street parking after 6pm and considering it is not in the heart of downtown you usually can find parking easily.\\n\\nFirst off when I walked through the doors the smell was amazing. The open kitchen allows the aroma of the dishes to linger through the restaurant. The wooden floors, tables and bar gives the place a warm clean feel. Although maybe not as romantic or fancy as some restaurants it is a very date worthy place. I was solo and chose to sit at the bar where I could get a clear view of the kitchen. I ended up sitting next to one of the owners (Steve?) who was enthusiastic and shared a lot of information about the menu, food preparation and cocktail menu. Although some of the same folks behind Peche are behind this knew venture, the food is a bit simpler (no more than 7 ingredients) and the drinks are Italian inspired.  They have a brick oven where they make their pizzas and they make all their breads in house. \\n\\nI ordered the aperol spritz which is aperol. prosecco, soda and lemon. It was slightly sweet and bitter drink. I like contrasting flavors so this cocktail was a win in my book. After Steve mentioned the slow roasted pork used in their panuozzo (porchetta sandwich) was roasted for 17 hours and showed me a picture of the beast, I was sold. The sandwich came on housemade rosemary ficaccia and served with a small salad (or toppings) of arugula, Manchego and a slice of lemon. The pork was so freakn moist with out being disgustingly greasy. The pork just melted in my mouth. It was filling enough that I could only finish 1/2 of my sandwich and took the rest home.  Although the pork was good I did not get the fennel or many other flavors from the meat. However it was not over salted either. Regardless I would order this menu item again.\\n\\nTips: \\n-Order the 3 G's cocktail (not on the menu). It has Gin, St. Germaine and grappa.

Several fast food options lie along this intersection including: Muchas Gracias, Taco Bell, and Chipotle. McDonald's is a bit farther down on NE Weidler and NE Grand Ave.\\n\\nAfter the Rose Garden Centennial celebration, I stopped by here for a late dinner with my fiancee and her Dad . Luckily, we remembered to utilize our $12.99 Family Bundle coupon from the local newspaper - two whoppers, two cheeseburgers, four fries, and four drinks! Can you believe it? And there were only three of us! Burger King definitely wins out in the coupon category compared to the other fast food joints. \\n\\nWhile the drive-thru is open 24 hours a day/7 days a week, I believe the dine-in hours end at 10 pm. We were able to slip in around 9:40 pm with three other parties waiting ahead of us for their food near the register. We excitedly brought out the $12.99 coupon and ordered the Family Bundle. As usual and to satisfy his cravings, my fiancee's Dad asked for extra lettuce and onions. The exhausted and obviously indifferent employee, a teenager, dutifully entered our order despite her tired exterior. Her store manager, a middle-aged woman, showed the same exhausted and indifferent expression. Beyond the register and towards the back stood a singular food prep employee. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our order, I scanned the area for good seats close to the register. Since we arrived rather late to the establishment, the employees already finished most of their cleaning towards the back near the bathrooms. Finally, we spotted a \\"four-seater\\" table near the windows, but realized that one of the seats was \\"missing,\\" as in \\"the entire seat no longer sat there either because it was: 1) ripped out due to its non-functioning, or 2) possibly vandalized and caused a distraction and the Burger King could not renovate in time due to lack of resources.\\" But, that's only speculation. \\n\\nLike other fast food joints, this Burger King supplies a huge, bright red Coca-Cola soda machine with one external spout for the soda to come out of and a digital screen that allows you to customize your drink (even mixing it is possible) from the numerous sodas available. I myself am not a big fan of soda, but looking at this behemoth and its bells and whistles dazzled me more than once. \\n\\nOnce the manager called out our order, we walked up and brought it to our table, anxious to bite into the juicy burgers. After taking the first few bites of his whopper, my Fiancee's Dad looked at his burger for a few seconds and scanned it from a few angles before standing up. He then proceeded to walk towards the register and asked the teenage employee if the minimal lettuce and onions on his whopper constituted \\"extra lettuce and onions.\\" The teenage employee barely looked at him before confirming it was \\"extra lettuce and onions.\\" Obviously confused, my Fiancee's Dad slowly walked back to our table, a hint of disappointment on his face. I suggested that he ask the store manager for extra lettuce and tomatoes. \\n\\nAfter finishing her short smoke break, the store manager strolled in. On cue, my Fiancee's Dad whipped out his whopper and asked subtly asked the manager passing by our table and ask what he received constituted \\"extra lettuce and tomatoes.\\" She quickly responded with a \\"yes,\\" barely looking at the burger, before heading back to the kitchen. Seemingly defeated and now indifferent, my Fiancee's Dad continued to munch on his malnourished whopper. Watching all this unfold before her, my Fiancee could no longer stand the injustice and proceeded to the register and demanded extra lettuce and onions. A few seconds later, she got her wish, and brought the extra treats back to our table where her Dad enjoyed them happily. \\n\\nLesson learned - to get what you want at this place, you need to demand it directly from the employees, otherwise, they will continue to exhibit the lackluster customer service that unfortunately is the norm in fast food joints."},{"name":"The Chateau","address":"535 John Mahar Hwy","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"We go here often & never have an issue.

We love the adventure of not knowing what we're about to eat!\\n\\nIt is $100 for a five course menu, but they are also offering a promo $60 three course menu right now. We could never pass up a special offer so we ordered the $60 promo.\\n\\nThe food was really good. We started off with fried snapper wrap dressed in a flavourful Italian dressing - that's how the sauce was described to us. The second course was Alberta beef that was lightly marinated, sliced and served with three kinds of saut√©ed mushroom. The beef was very tender and I enjoyed the slightly sweet marinade, but the dish could have been served warmer. The third course was nigiri sushi. The fish were very fresh and each peice was nicely seasoned so the taste of fish was not overwhelmed by soy sauce. This was definitely my favourite course.\\n\\nAnd then there was dessert...yes, that's right, the three course menu is actually four courses! Tonight's dessert was a banana cheesecake pudding with assorted fruit. It's not something that I would normally go for, but I appreciated the creativity. The pudding itself tasted okay, but some of the fruit choices didn't pair well with the banana flavour.\\n\\nService was a bit too casual and not yet refined enough to match the food in my opinion. Though our waiter was very attentive, it seems as though he was lacking fine dining experience. The chef was very personable. He welcomed us at the beginning of our meal and made sure to thank us as we were leaving...hospitality the Japanese way."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place - and my carnivore fiance likes it too...that says a lot.

It was a nice place! Great atmosphere, friendly service, virtually not a bad seat throughout the entire place.\\n\\nMy complaint was that what I ordered, something down the lines of a Halibut steak. What came to me was a plate with a piece of fish relatively the size of a Hostess Ding Dong and two sprigs of asparagus. I chucked out something like $20 for this plate of food which appeared to be just an appetizer. \\nMy date however ordered some pasta dish with shrimp and I've never seen so much food on a plate in my life.

I have never seen such a beautiful salad bar, very fresh. I had the Greek salad, made to order in the kitchen. DELICIOUS, I usually am too picky to enjoy a salad. Lettuce pieces the right size, feta, olives, delicate flavored red onions, great dressing. Our server was Talia, very attentive, I have a seafood allergy and she was thorough and careful. The turkey sandwich is stacked high with good turkey and provolone. It comes with the greatest pasta salad, which is not at all oily. I think it's made with magic. I don't know how they make it so delicious without visible dressing. My husband had a steak with a side of pasta and marinara sauce. We were so impressed, we ordered dinner to go.

We arrived on a Tuesday at 7:45 without a reservation and were seated right away. The service was excellent. The food was very good. I had a salad that was a mix of cooked and raw vegetables. It was not as tasty as I'd imagined. My husband had the wedge salad and loved it. I got the 6 oz filet with the carrot side and my husband had the lamb chops with the baked potato side (which had a crispy outside that I loved). My steak was cooked perfectly and had a tasty char. Manager came by to ask how everything was. When we got the check, I did think it was odd that a place with such pricey steaks charged $4 for bread. My husband said the bread was \\"ok\\". And while the steak I got was enough for me, it was definitely the smallest \\"6 oz\\" steak I'd ever had, and that may be a disappointment to some. It arrived in the center of a huge plate which just made us both laugh. The carrot side was very large though, enough for a table of four to share. The outside area looked very nice, but even though it was a mild evening, no one was sitting out there. Guests can valet or self park in a fairly large adjacent lot.

Our waiter was very kind and the service overall was good. We started with the meat plate and I enjoyed the selection and variety. It wasn't anything fancy, but a good starter. My boyfriend ordered the bouillabaisse but the sauce was very watery. It didn't have a lot of flavor. I couldn't taste much spice to it. I ordered the salade nicoise and was pleased. Lastly, we ordered the waffle for dessert. It was flakey and satisfying. \\n\\nThe price wasn't too bad and we got a lot of dishes for the evening. However, I don't know if the food was that special.

He insisted on that we cannot use our deals even though we bought separate Groupons and are willing to sit separately. His attitude was so bad that though a few of the ppl in the group was willing to just pay the regular fare to sit down and eat, most of the group were so offended by his attitude that they decided to go else where. \\n\\n====\\nword of advise to the management team:\\n\\nIf you strike a bad deal with Groupon or is losing money over the deals sold, don't take it out on the customers because you will not help your restaurant image. Please deal with your Groupon representative directly to resolve the issue.

While waiting for my friend to arrive, I noticed so many people coming in, and was thinking the restaurant might fill up and there would be no booth for me and my friend. I asked the hostess if she could reserve a booth and she tells me there are booths for 2 people up against the wall and she will save one of those for us.  But those booths are so tiny, there's hardly enough room to even put the food on the table. So I selected a space against the booth in the bar area. After my friend arrived, we ordered drinks, and the waitress brought them, but no bread was served. She took our orders. After we noticed her serving bread to other tables, as she passed us, I said 'can we please have some bread'--\\"yes, coming right up\\" and then there she was at the bar again making drinks, etc. FINALLY, she brought us a basket of bread. There were 4 pieces, two of which were edible. The first piece I pulled out was mangled, and actually looked like someone had eaten part of it and it was tough and stale. The other thing that was unpleasant was the (supposedly) olive oil that was served with the bread. (I wish I had taken pics of these things) The bread and olive oil concoction in the past has been delicious. This time, however, it was so lacking. The flavor was simply not there. The olive oil (If it is in fact olive oil) was pale yellow in color. Most EVOO that I have had is a greenish color, and rich looking. This was thin and the taste reminded me of corn oil or melted margarine. It was just not right! There didn't seem to be any garlic in the olive oil either. So then, I ordered a side caesar, and the waitress arrives with a dish with torn up romaine, and dressing on side (as requested, thank you), and this miniscule piece of pita bread that was stale, and inedible. But before we get to that, the salad was missing the 'shaved romano cheese' so I told the waitress and she promptly returned the salad and brought it back with shaved cheese. So where are we now?? The pizza. I had ordered the roasted tomato pizza with tomatoes and basil. There was no red sauce. It was a little disappointing, but not terrible. The waitresses (2 of them who helped) were pleasant, and I enjoyed spending time with my friend. But overall the dinner wasn't very good, and left a lot to be desired. The last time I ate at this restaurant was in June 2016 and it was much better then. I think the quality here is suffering. I personally would rather pay for bread, and have something good, than get some stale bread at no cost with that awful tasting oil (God knows what it really is). On a good note, the IPA draft (DogFish?) was delicious. I will likely give this place another try (maybe this was a 'bad hair day' for this establishment), but they need to pay more attention to what they are serving.

Trust me, I lived within walking distance for nearly three years; it's a nice area, mostly residential. I'm not sure what would be threatening about Ball Square. I've lived in bad areas before, and this is not one of them.) The only caveat is that it can get very, very loud in their dining room when most of the tables are full.\\n\\nI'm veg, so I've mostly stuck to pasta here. Their gnocchi is phenomenal. Great vodka cream sauce and buffalo mozzarella with it. This and a salad is a pretty solid dinner (and next day's lunch) for me.

It was my first time there and it was amazing.\\nMy friend and I were promptly seated and we got to sit at one of the high top table, which I love, close to the fireplace. One of the managers greeted us and made sure the fireplace didn't bother me too much, since I was the one right next to it. Because it was cold outside, it was perfect to be sitting right next to something warm so I was perfectly comfortable with it. \\n\\nWe were then greeted by probably one of the best servers I've ever had in any restaurant: Lola. She was quirky, nice, super funny, and really knowledgeable about the menu.  She made our dining experience there even better.\\n\\nAPPETIZERS:\\nWe started off with two: \\nSteamed Chicken and Pork Dumplings & Fried Calamari drizzled with Japanese Mayo. \\n\\nThe dumpling were amazing! I think they were one of the best I've ever had before. It came with a ginger soy sauce on the side and it was a perfectly made sauce to be paired with these amazing cooked dumplings. \\n\\nThe calamari was also really good. My only critique about it was that it was a little hard to eat because the breading on it would fall off the calamari when I picked it up. Other than that it was still pretty good, but I enjoyed the dumplings a lot better. \\n\\nENTREES:\\nNext, our main course: \\nMy friend ordered the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass and I ordered the Siam Black Tiger Shrimp and Scallop Stir-Fried. \\n\\nThe sea bass came with sun dried tomato, asparagus, artichoke heart blanco, and decorated with a quail egg on the top. I got to taste my friend's dish since I looooveee sea bass. It was perfectly cooked; the bite just melted in your mouth - it was amazing. \\n\\nMy shrimp and scallop dish was also a hit. Really well cooked with pineapple, cashews, vegetables, sweet chili herb sauce with jasmine rice on the side. All of the ingredients balanced each other out perfectly. \\n\\n\\nWe happily finished all of our food. We wished we could have tried some dessert but we were just so full. We literally probably licked our plates clean starting with the appetizers. \\n\\nThis is a fantastic restaurant. Service was on point, food was amazing, and it was just a nice environment to be in. It is a little pricey but it's really worth what you'll spend. I highly recommend this restaurant for a date night or some sort. \\n\\nI will definitely be back to Poor Calvin's.

However being born and raised in Portland I also have an honest opinion of the place.\\n\\nThe lines are long. Like really long. If you want to stand in line for about an hour in order to receive just an OKAY pastry, this is just your cup of tea. It's funny because the lines never seem to die down. No matter the time. I've been to Voodoo at 2am and I still found myself waiting with a flock to retrieve the almighty sugar bread.\\n\\nThe doughnuts themselves are not the best doughnuts I've ever had. The dough is kind of stale and crunchy, the frosting and fillings hard and cracking. Obviously they have a lot of customers to serve, and thus doughnuts spend a long time out on the shelf during the day. But if I'm going to be waiting in a line for six days, I would like to shove the best doughnut of my life in my gob. You'd just think with all the DOUGH they rake in every day they'd be able to get the doughnut game right.\\n\\nTourists are fantastic. They bring a lot of revenue into the city and I appreciate their existence...just not in my vicinity. They are anxious, loud, and crowding up the place, and they're all apparently at Voodoo. \\n\\nCash only. They have an ATM inside if you want to be charged five extra bucks to withdraw cash. \\n\\nParking is a nightmare and to be expected because it's right in the middle of downtown. I recommend just getting to one of the many pay to park parking lots in the area. Or you could drive around the block eight times before finding street parking...to also pay for.\\n\\nHOWEVER, all that being said, I do recommend you go there at least once if you've never been. It's a cool experience with friendly staff and a very Portland vibe- just be aware of what you're getting into so you're not gravely disappointed.

The food was tasty but had ZERO heat.  The pad thai was tasty but very different than your traditional flavor.  I liked it.  But I liked it way more after I added a tiny spoonful of the hot red pepper sauce they provide.  Same really goes for the beef dish.  So, is it a good place, yes.

The pizza had just the right amount of crust and cheese ratio. The only thing I would like to have seen was a larger draft selection. As far as I could tell they only served Peroni. I didn't feel like wine, sue me!

I chose this place because it seemed that it had decent prices and decent food. Both of these ended up being true.\\n\\nI came in with a friend on a weeknight around 6ish and the only people were middle-aged guys at the bar. At first it seemed like a dive irish bar, but oh man was the italian food amazing. I was scarfing it all down so fast that when I stopped I realized I was waayyy too full. The walk to back bay station was pretty much in slow motion. I had a pasta dish with sausage and red sauce, garlic bread, a salad and some sangria. The salad came with a choice of pesto dressing which is rare and I enjoyed the hell out of it. Bread also came free with the best oil dipping mixture I think I've ever had. I probably would have passed on the garlic bread if this had come before we ordered. No worries though. The waitress was really awesome - just genuine and patient, which is nice compared to servers who are normally rushing all over the place. The sangria was also fabulous, nice and sweet which is what I prefer over tartness.  My friend ordered something with alfredo sauce which I didn't try but she said was great. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience, good food, good portions, good prices. I took a star off due to the fact that the place is so dark that I felt like I was underground. Going outside with the sun still out was kind of a shock.

It was a decent piece of pizza, but I also liked (for years) the $1 Totinos you get out of the freezer section (i.e. I like pizza in general). That being said...\\n\\nI didn't quite buy it, in the figurative sense. The crust was as people have described: sort of crispy, sort of chewy. To me it was sort of like stale bread, but nonetheless okay.\\n\\nI read a couple of other 5 STAR reviews that noted the bland toppings and cheese. Why did they give it 5 stars then? Anyways, I agree with that observation. The ricotta is pretty weak and ends up just being some extra mush sitting atop in splotches on the pie. The sausage was pretty average and the \\"roasted\\" red peppers didn't seem too different from normal red peppers.\\n\\nBottom line: The hype did not agree with me. It was decent and I would eat here again, but not very often. I'll give the place another go and try one of the other specialties, but I probably won't be trying the #6 again.\\n\\nI called in ahead for a pick-up order. From hang-up to pick-up was about 30 minutes.

Our table was a little small for 4 people, but that is part of the charm.\\n\\nFood - The menu has all of the standard Italian dishes, but nothing really special or unusual, it is all basically... protein, cheese, sauce (marinara or alfredo), over pasta.  We ordered sausage and peppers, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parm, and a calzone.  Everything tasted good, but nothing was particularly special or worth returning for.  Honestly, I would say it is on par with Macaroni Grill or Buca de Beppo when it comes to the food.  The sauces were good, but nothing special.  The meatballs tasted good, but are very soft, almost the consistency of gelatin.  The chicken parm and sausage dishes were standard faire, more or less the same as you get everywhere.  The calzone was bready.  The garlic bread and salads that came with our meals were perfectly adequate, but again, nothing special.  If you eat low carb or are looking for something a little different in an Italian restaurant, there are few options at Reales.\\n\\nPrice - $70 with tip for four mains (including side salads) and 4 non-alcoholic drinks.

Other than that, I like their chicken salad which is delicious but I doubt that I'll ever return to this spot. It's way too expensive for what they're serving.

There were new employees there who were obviously getting trained by one of the managers. It was obvious they were new and very nervous. Totally understandable. They were taking a little longer to make the drinks, but I've been working in the food industry for quite some time now. When I first started I was slow and people were very patient with me. Being slow was perfectly fine with me. It was normal to be kind of slow and ask me some questions about how I like it.

The manager training the young new employees  (who could not have been older than 16 or 17) was incredibly rude and was yelling at her for messing up one drink and taking too long. We are not perfect. And to mess up ONE drink while your brand new is totally expected. Not only was it incredibly uncalled for, but he did it in front of customers!! I can't even imagine how he treats them not in front of customers. I was very angry. I am a manager and train people all the time.

It was very flavorful but could have used a bit more spice or herbs with the lemon olive oil. The red snapper has a really nice white sauce that made me like red snapper more than I usually do. It won in the contest of new entrees. \\n\\nIt is worth it to note that behind us someone ordered the chicken, which I normally wouldn't choose at a place like this, but mannnn.

The tables are a bit small, but that's probably good because it lets them seat more people.\\n\\nFrank serves a good hot dog, which is reasonably priced. For that they score a good rating. I was hoping they served a knock your socks off great hot dog, but they didn't get to that level.  I tried the Chicago Dog and a side of potato salad.  I would recommend the potato salad if only for the crumbled bacon.  Try a different hot dog than the Chicago Dog, it was good but not memorable.  \\n\\nGo check out Frank, it's definitely worth a visit.

For example, when I asked for a small serving plate, they told me that it's not in their policy to give me one because their portions are individual and are not to be shared.  They are probably discouraging sharing of plates but I've ordered five dishes for five people... just plain ignorant.  Ok, that's policy so, although unusual, so be it.\\n\\nHere's the important bit.  The tofu pad thai was mediocre with the rice noodles way undercooked.  The tofu chunks were inedible because one of the pieces were sour.  This is a bad piece that should have never been served and the cook should have been able to take a whiff of it before attempting to poison people with it.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a sketchy dive of a place and their kitchen policy is no doubt similar.

The bathrooms were authentic elementary school, they even have showers in them which was a little weird. I can't really explain the eerie breeze the creep through this place but it's pretty exciting just being there.

We got bread right away, and the salads didn't take too long. The waiter presented the two salads to the men and gave each of the women a smaller plate. We were surprised that he couldn't have split the salads for us. We were also surprised that each salad had only two anchovies -- one for each person at the table, I guess. A little paltry. \\n\\nThen we waited what seemed like a very long time for our pizzas. The waiter finally said they were coming, and then maybe 10 minutes later one of them arrived. Each one came out separately, over a period of about 10 minutes. The waiter gave us no explanation until my husband asked, and then he said the kitchen was overwhelmed. The restaurant at that point was busy but not full. \\n\\nThe pizza was good but not great. Mine had smoked salmon, fontina cheese and arugula. There was very little salmon. The crust was light, almost puffy -- a pleasant texture, but quite bland. \\n\\nThe waiter didn't ask us if we wanted anything else and basically showed no interest in being pleasant.

I was a little disappointed that they didn't have bigger ones being a place that seems to have the reputation for being \\"all that.\\" Come on UOH, get some really big guys. However, our hard-shell heavenly hulks were nonetheless tasty and mental.

The meals came with baked \\"bah-day-dahs\\" and two teenie pieces of cornbread. The damage on these lobsters was even more expensive than Abe and Louie's that includes trending yuppie butters with a basket of hot fresh-baked artisan rolls, not just janky little pieces of cornbread with butter pats. The service at UOH was decent but not on par with the price -service could have been more attentive and less harried.

I got excited when I saw this cute little place which is near my house- I told my husband we need to go asap.  It is SO CUTE!  It is small and you can tell there was a lot of thought put into the d√©cor.  It was pretty busy when we stopped in around lunchtime on a Monday.  We were greeted rather promptly and when ordering the service was friendly enough.  We both ordered chicken and waffles and iced mochas.  It took a good 15-20 min for our food to come out- which I don't mind as that means it's all being cooked fresh to order.  What I did mind is what happened afterwards- our food was delivered and she said \\"Oh I need to bring y'all silverware and syrup\\".  I already had silverware but my husband did not.  But then she never came back.  We waited about 5 min and when the food was being delivered to the table next to us we waved her down to ask again for the silverware and syrup.  She finally brought them over and the silverware she gave my husband was plastic ware- mine was regular silverware- kind of weird- and kind of hard to eat waffles and fried chicken with cheap plastic ware (not to mention wasteful!).  Meanwhile, we still have not gotten our iced mochas.  It sure would have been nice to have those to sip on during the time we were waiting for our food- instead of getting them afterwards.  The iced mochas finally came out and were delicious.  So was the food (hence why I'm giving 3 stars when I was very tempted to only give 2).  This place has a lot of potential but I think it has some kinks it needs to work out.  For a tiny little neighborhood spot- I don't want service that is just friendly enough- I want super friendly and personable service and in such a small restaurant I don't want to have to be looking around and asking for a simple thing like silverware.

The male server was extremely busy, but doing an impressive job of keeping everyone happy.  He seemed to enjoy making a bit of a show and loudly proclaiming things such as  \\"I've never seen the place so busy, it's crazzzy!\\"  First off, we were served warm corn bread which is always a pleasure, especially when not expected.  However, that was the peak of the culinary experience as the Crab Cake Sandwich which arrived was dry, bland and served with a grotesquely large portion of fries.

Perhaps.\\n\\nI went to a Yelp event (thanks for the good time, Leighann!) here and was really, really pleased with the atmosphere at the service. It started getting busy around 7 or so, but was never over-stuffed or chaotic. Lots and lots of takeout orders were placed. Our group had some pizzas brought over and they looked and smelled delicious. I, unfortunately, can't partake of the cheesy, bready goodness, but everyone seemed to jump on in there and things got a bit quieter as people stuffed their faces with childlike glee. \\n\\nWhat I COULD partake of, however, was the sangria. I only tried the red as someone mentioned that the white was a bit sweeter than the red and, being the dry red wine kind of girl that I am, I opted to leave the white for everyone else. It looked citrusy and had mint in it, though, so I would hazard a guess that it was a mojito-like citrus mix, which I bet would be gorgeous on a hot summer day. The red was tasty. I have to admit, it was a bit too fruity and Kool-Aidy for my taste, but I think I was in the minority. I prefer my sangria to have more of a wine taste. \\n\\nThat said, the service was fantastic, they dealt with our loud crowd very well, and the location is perfect. I hope to try it again sometime.

If someone visits your restaurant and happens to sit at the bar, what do you say, \\"Hi, can I get you something to drink, have you been here before, this is what we have that's good, I recommend this, just in case, etc.\\" It's proper bar etiquette and whoever is the manager needs to train them this way. \\n\\nYou don't just shove a menu in front of the guests face and then go on attending to a couple who arrived after I did. I hate to pull the single card but that's what it was. Some folks just cannot handle the single diner and they have no other recourse but to hate. They seem to forget that I am a paying customer. The rave reviews have gone to their head and they don't want to work hard anymore to earn your business.  \\n\\nThe other bad. The prices. Calamari - $10. I don't care what kind of sauce you have if the calamari cannot feed two people, it should not cost as much as a whole meal. There was no single entree less than $15 - that is not good. It's a  restaurant for the recession proof people, I suppose. \\n\\nOverall, I won't be going back anytime soon, particularly not by myself, and if I do, I'll get a reservation and seat at a nice table instead of the crusty bar-tops and deal with those uncouth bartenders."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I was introduced to Amelies when my company had a business lunch catered by them and it was SUCH a refreshing departure from the \\"same old, same old\\" corporate catering options!!

I went with the lamb cheeks as my main entree because it just sounded absolutely delicious. I was right- the meat was so tasty and tender, and the mash was perfect. Every bite had me wanting more! My boyfriend went with the veal schnitzel which he was very happy with as well.

Long story short, the woman that made my sandwich was not only talking on her cell phone while making my sandwich (I didn't care about the rudeness factor, it was about the filthiness of cell phones and germs and her holding her phone to her head while making my sandwich), but that she removed one of her gloves and continued to try and make my sandwich. I asked her very politely to please not continue touching my sandwich until she got off of the phone and she responded that the other girls could finish making my sandwich and that she'd take her call behind the wall. I am NOT a germa-phobe by any stretch of the imagination, but the fact that this was repulsing me was enough to prompt me writing a corporate complaint and sending a much deserved Yelp review. Disgusting health and wellness violations on many levels and the flippant and horrible customer service I received in her response to me asking her to correct the disgusting behavior was atrocious.

I asked the server if I can get black coffee instead and she just shakes her head an mutters to herself \\"that's what HK coffee is\\" and walks off. \\n\\nThe ox tail spaghetti I ordered was extremely salty but the ox tail was nice and tender.

I also enjoy the velveeta-y queso. They have some of the best salsa in town if you like a bit of spice- and it pairs well with the mild queso and tortilla chips. The food here is so-so. Some of the dishes are okay, yet more often then not I feel like my food is either too greasy or luke warm. The tortilla soup is great if the service (which is BAD) can get you the order before it chills. Homemade tacos are good but too greasy for me. Fish tacos lack flavor. Chile rellano is just a mess of goop. Fried appetizers and nachos are good- not too hard to screw that up. I have tried far more items on the menu than I'd like to admit. I am secretly searching for an item that can match my love for the margs and queso. Maybe I should just stick to drinking and noshing on chips. The south location lacks the authentic Mexican ambiance of the downtown location, however, the patio is very nice on a cool afternoon or evening. Also worth noting is that they have a mariachi band on weekend evenings, so if you aren't into the loud (at times obnoxious) music, then stick to afternoon or weekday nights. Or just go outside- but don't say that I didn't warn you about bad service.

Oddest of all, the hostess came to our table when the food came out and said \\"sorry the food took so long, the salmon takes a long time to grill\\" (defrost did she mean?) and the waitress says, \\"They did not order salmon,\\"  The hostess goes, \\"oh\\" and flounces off.  ???  \\n\\nAnd the food literally made me sick.

This restaurant is located on the 52nd floor of the Prudential Center in Downtown Boston, and all the walls are lined with windows.  The view from this restaurant is unmatched -- and that alone makes it worth a visit.  \\n\\nWhen making a reservation, I would advise not to book online via \\"Open Table.\\"  For me, it showed that it was all booked through the whole month.  I decided to take a shot and call and the hostess advised that they were completely open...so call instead!\\n\\nWe were sat with a great view of the Charles River and they acknowledged my mother's birthday right away.  Our waiter, Robert, was phenomenal.  I think he was one of the highlights of our night.  He really went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect.  He made great recommendations for cocktails for us, and brought out my mother's birthday dessert at the perfect time.  \\n\\nThe cocktails here are GREAT.  I recommend the Bombay Sapphire Martini, Mango Mojito, Black Rum Iced Coffee, and the Banana Foster Martini.  I promise you, all of these are delicious!  I also love that they give you the glass along with the shaker.  So you can pour more when you're ready.  Very cute!\\n\\nFor the food...we got the oysters, which were great.  We also each got the lobster bisque -- which I highly recommend.  Honestly, it was probably my favorite food item on the menu.  I ordered the Togarashi Seared Tuna Steak as my main entree -- and YIKES.  I ordered it medium and I swear to you, it was like a block of cement.  I sent it back and Robert, our server, was so nice about it.  I decided to just share my mother's dish, which were the George's Bank Seared Scallops -- and honestly...these were overcooked as well.  They were hard and solid, not seared on the outside and soft on the inside, which is how scallops should be.  I know others at my table were also disappointed by their entrees.  We ordered the creme brulee for dessert --and this was good!  \\n\\nOverall, I'd say -- come for the view and for the appetizers/cocktails.  Don't bother with the entrees.

The food would best be categorized as somewhere between mediocre and terribad. For starters, the \\"Spinach Dumplings\\" are an abomination. I have no idea if they actually contain any spinach because all I could taste was peanut butter. My noodles were supposed to be mildly spicy, but were sickly sweet instead. I would not be surprised if the cook doused them with ketchup in some sort of desperate appeal to the American palate. Perhaps the \\"Etc\\" in the restaurant's name is a hidden reference to the gobs of American junk food they infuse into their food! My girlfriend's soup was the best of the lot, but was still nothing special. \\n\\nBased on the food alone, TNEH merits at most 2 stars. The remaining -7 stars are awarded to the atrocious service. At the outset, our waiter seemed friendly, but I began to detect an undercurrent of derision and condescension roiling beneath the surface. Who knows, maybe it was my imagination. \\n\\nWhen we placed our order, we clearly stated that I was allergic to peanuts and I asked our waiter to ensure that none of our dishes contained any. Now, I'm not one of those people who goes into anaphylactic shock... peanuts \\"only\\" give me canker sores. This allergic reaction, while not fatal, is quite unpleasant. When the \\"Spinach Dumplings\\" arrived, I immediately noticed that they were served with a side of peanut sauce, though the waiter did not bother to warn me about this. While that made me nervous, I figured I'd be safe as long as I didn't dip the dumplings in the sauce, so I plopped one in my mouth. As I noted above, these dumplings were stuffed with peanut butter, which burst from the soggy dumpling wrapper and assaulted my tongue like shrapnel.\\n\\nI flagged down the waiter and told him that the dumplings contained peanut butter. He denied that they did... I insisted... He said he'd check with the cook. He returned and acknowledged that the dumplings DID contain peanut butter, but he didn't know it. He never apologized.\\n\\nThe arrival of the check was the grand finale. We were charged for the aforementioned dumplings. I again flagged down the waiter and asked him to remove the charge. He said he'd charge me half, for the two dumplings eaten (one eaten by me and one by my girlfriend). I told him to remove it entirely since it was his mistake that I ate something to which I am allergic. He went to the back and out came an older lady, who told me I could get a refund only if I let them photocopy my driver's license.

It is a great journey through Ethiopian vegetarian foods, the food is spiced perfectly, and the owner is generous with additional bread to grab all the veggies. It easily serves 2 people, and feels like a buffet has been brought to your table. Unfortunately the lows include the owner himself, who at times is gregarious and welcoming, and at other times not as accommodating. I had an issue with a Groupon, and even as a regular customer, he refused to make it right. (Groupon did) The lunch buffet also suffers from inconsistency, which may have to do with some days it being busy, and other days with empty tables. In this economy, the restaurant business isn't easy, and this one could go either way. The inconsistency of the food, and the owners attitude, reflect the pressure of trying to balance costs, quality, and service. I am always surprised that they do not offer any type of coffee.

We decided to take the plunge and come here for happy hour on a Friday night despite the low Yelp reviews. \\n\\nWINE: Upon walking in we were greeted right away and got a seat at the bar. There was a special going on that night 10 wine tastings for $10. Seemed like a pretty good deal and since it was out first time going there we decided to give it a try.  The staff picked out the ten wines for you and gave you a card with all of the names of the wines on it.  It was a very good mixture of different wines and I would say it was hard picking out our favorite.   The wines had very \\"exotic\\" flavors that I have never tasted in a wine before; ex: Mint Mojito, Hard Limeade.  We honestly loved all of them; and if the bottles weren't so expensive we would have taken one home. \\n\\nFOOD: We looked at the food menu online and we saw a few things that looked good although they seemed overpriced. We thought \\"okay, maybe they're big portions or something\\". After arriving, the manager had told us about two flatbreads they had for $10 each. One was a spinach and artichoke flatbread and the other was a margarita flatbread. We decided to just try both. About halfway through our tasting the food comes out; which was a very reasonable amount of time. The guy that brought it out was extremely nice and he must have worked in the kitchen since I only saw him that one time. The flatbreads looked and smelled AMAZING. My spinach and artichoke was absolutely perfect and had a lot of melty cheese on it. The plate had a delicious olive oil spread that I would dip each piece into for extra flavor. I would even go as far as saying this was the best spinach and artichoke flatbread I've ever had. My partner got the margarita flatbread which was also very good but we both liked mine better. We both aren't very big tomato people and the margarita flatbread had slices of whole tomato on it rather than diced up tomato which we prefer. \\n\\nVALUE:  So why only 3 stars? Value is where this place falls short. After trying all of the wines and food I had   full intentions of giving a 5 star rating. Actually, my partner was even going to make a Yelp account just to rate it 5 stars as well. We started to change our mind after we still felt hungry after eating our food. There just was not enough there to have a $10 price tag on it; also considering most of the ingredients were cheese and bread. Another thing that occurred was after we had finished our tasting as asked to see a wine menu because we really wanted to get a full glass of something to enjoy. After viewing the prices on menu - $7.75 to $12.50 a glass - we decided to pass on that. We thought \\"maybe we will just bring a bottle home\\" since the bottles themselves were about $12.  We told the bartender that we were considering bringing a bottle home and if we could have a taste of their sangria blush. We had thought since we were going to bring a bottle home and we had just dropped about $45 there already that this taste would be free. It ended up being $1 and it was barely enough to let two people try it. Luckily I saw a sign behind the bar that if you check in on social media you get a free tasting. I told the manager I checked in on Yelp and she took off price they charged to taste. \\n\\nMy partner and I both said that if the tasting would have been free to begin with we would have most likely bought the bottle since we would have felt obligated after receiving the free tasting.  Every other winery I have been to the tasting was either free or less that 50 cents because they know that once you have a taste you'll buy more.  This is just a terrible business model on their part and they need to take advice from other winery's. \\n\\nSTAFF: The bartenders and the staff were extremely nice and very friendly. Connor (I believe that was his name) was so personable and friendly. We also had someone serve us who said it was her first night working there. You would have never known as she was on top of her game! The issue here I think may be the manager. Although she was very nice to us (the customers), I heard her walking around barking orders at the staff constantly. It actually made us kind of uncomfortable because there was one point we were out of wine and waiting for our next glass and the staff was busy putting away a ton of glasses. She went over to them and pointed to us and another group of people and ordered him to stop what he was doing and help us. Why couldn't she just help us? It makes everyone feel uncomfortable when a manager is talking down to employees that have been nothing but kind us. I know they were very busy that night because it was comedy night and was almost a packed house but the manager should be helping the bartenders and not just walking back and forth barking orders to them. Again, she was very nice to us just not the staff.\\n\\nWe will be back, but only during happy hour."},{"name":"The Vape Shop","address":"6 Tremont St","city":"Brighton","stars":"5","text":"Waited twenty minutes to buy one bottle of juice.

Their specialty hot dogs have been calling my name for a while and I was definitely drawn to the idea of a hot dog made of rabbit, antelope and pork sausage (the Jackalope).\\n\\nSo far I have tried the currywurst ($4.50) that is an unconventional, cut-up hot dog covered in a sweet and tangy barbecue sauce. Good stuff. The jalapeno fries were cholesterol-laden, cheesy and divine. Not a huge fan of the Chicago hot dog ($3.95)--it's a bit plain compared to the rest of their menu, and too much relish for my taste. Jackalope ($7) was a clear winner. Paying that much for a hot dog seemed excessive but it's a must-try at Frank.

What was up with the Frankencookie ($4, bacon-infused cookie with Amy's ice cream)!!!

For starters, the staff isn't overly friendly or welcoming, so I just didn't feel like a 'guest.' And the menu, while wonderfully vegan and vegetarian, just didn't thrill me. There was really nothing that enticed me, so I went with the Garden Breakfast as I was looking to eat healthy. The eggs were poached pretty well but the yolks were watery.

We were very hungry so we asked for bread right out but had to remind the waiter about it after we got our entrees. Then the crumbly roll/biscuits arrived with cold centers.

The lemon curd, lingonerry jam and apple sauce are all on POINT and go heavenly with the round fluff of amazingness.  After my first exposure to aebleskivers, I couldn't stop thinking about them and purchased my very own aebleskiver pan.

I've also tried the Mango Tango ($1.95, mango flavor was too fake for me), Dirt Doughnut ($1.75, oreos on a donuts, was solid but nothing special), Portland Cream ($1.75, delicious, one of my other top donuts), McMinnville Cream ($1.75, custard filled maple donut, also one of my other top donuts, delish!), and The Loop ($1.35, fruit loops on a donut, just so so). \\n\\nThe best deal you can get at Voodoo is their Voodoo Dozen for $11.25, where they give you a random assortment of a dozen donuts, and they do include some of their deluxe donuts. One thing keep in mind is that the lines can get LONG, especially in the afternoons and nights on weekends. Try to come early if you can since they are open 24/7. Another tip is to call in your order so that they have everything ready for pick-up, although you still have to stand in line to pay. This is a good way to get extra Bacon Maple Bars if you are bringing them home with you since they limit customers to 6 per order when you walk in the store. However, if you call it in, you can order as many as you can carry/eat! Parking for this location can be tough.

We found street parking very close to the restaurant and walked in without rezzies.  We were greeted immediately and offered seats but chose two at the cozy bar. The place was buzzing, as expected.\\n\\nWow. What a good feel. The decor is clever by being warm and hip and simple and comfy and practical all at the same time. The brick walls have decorated inlays. The concrete bar is black with red accent lights. The room dividers - made of stacked hollow tubes - allow light through but mute sound so that it's not too noisy or dark. The bar chairs feel good.\\n\\nIn addition to the front room with the bar and booths, there's a larger room in the back with plenty of seating so the place feels cozy but can still seat a lot of people.\\n\\nFood. We started with the baby arugula salad which is a little miracle on a plate. Perfect flavor and texture. Then the skewers. This is a *chacun √† son go√ªt* thing. There's something for everyone, veggie and meat, east and west, but you have to like cumin because they use it a lot. We got the sausage, pork belly, lamb (my favorite), cauliflower, shiitake mushroom, chicken, beef neck tendon, chicken gizzard, and lamb kidney. The only one I didn't like was the tendon -- too chewy for me. Date loved everything and raved about the mushrooms. \\n\\nFrom where we were sitting, I could see larger family-style platters of sizzling somethings being devoured happily by people who looked very happy. Next time, I would happily try the fish.\\n\\nDrinks. We had beer and cocktails. The bartender was attentive and informative and congenial. He offered tastings and opinions and stories about the craft beers. He explained the cocktails and mixed them well. The bar itself is heavy on the fruity flavors -- that night the favored mixer was pineapple which is too sweet for me -- but bartender was willing and eager to mix and match to our taste.

Divine, delish..hot, crispy not over seasoned..just damn near perfect. \\n\\nNow the bad: The chicken fried steak and baked chicken and dressing. The chicken fried steak was just to meaty and resembled more a piece of beef covered in so so gravy. The baked chicken and dressing tasted old, the chicken did to.

I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food, but even my Texan roommate agrees that the drunken noodle is pretty hot.  Additionally, I can't say enough about the freshness of the ingredients.

She answered the phone with such a pleasant disposition and was completely open to me coming by and doing a tasting before committing to her doing 4 giant cupcakes for me. Now mind you, Sweet Cheats specialty is regular cupcakes but she does do special order cupcake 'cakes' as well. \\n\\nTruthfully, I wasn't expecting much in the way of the cupcakes but I believe everyone deserves a chance. It was unbelievable!!! At one point during the tasting, I kindly asked Shirley to leave the room so I could make sweet love to the chocolate champagne with raspberry buttercream cupcake in private but the sweet n'sinful strawberry cupcake was also divine!!\\n\\nBottom line, go try her cupcakes, you will become a fan for life!"},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Soooo good!!

I can't really describe the pizza beyond it being thinner than Chicago, thicker than NY, square, and having a crispy texture on the bottom of the pizza.  I don't have a huge appetite, but I can usually eat an entire pizza in a single sitting if I'm so inclined to do so, since they aren't huge (4 pieces).

My friend and I both ordered $15 drinks from the bar and each one tasted like gasoline, but was made very weak and I couldn't feel a thing, which brought this rating down another star.

I was driving past downtown so stopping downtown, to find a place to park and eat was not really desirable, but the place had my interest.  Score 1 point... it is very close to the 75/85 highway.  Score 100 points for having free parking next to the restaurant.  Be warned... the parking lot is very small.  It was too windy to set outside, so inside it is.  The place is small and there were two large speakers for what I image would be used to play music.  I can't image they could fit a small band and guest in the place.  The speakers messed up the decor, but hey... I was hear to eat.   It was lunch time and the place was not busy at 11:40am.  The server told me that they are packed in the evening.  I have a feeling that people will start to realize lunch time there isn't busy and flood the place... making lunch time busy.  Now to why we go out to eat... I was there for lunch so I had the steamed dumplings and crispy beef.  I drank water so I can only tell you that the tap water doesn't taste like a fish tank or a rotted water hose.  The food was fantastic.  The dumplings could use some color on the dough, but they melt in your mouth.  And the garlic warms the pallet without being overpowering.  The Crispy beef was a flavor and texture experience.  The raw vegetables have the perfect texture with the sauteed vegetables, the crispy beef, and the jasmine rice.

First, I have never had such high expectations for a restaurant only to be let down so significantly. We went to the Hub for a birthday party in which we had reservations with the appropriate number of guest. However, even with this knowledge, they sat us three tables apart. We asked several times if they could find a way to accommodate the entire party so we could all be together. I understand that it's difficult to do but when the table directly next to us is empty you'd think a place like this would accommodate our requests. Secondly, the food is way too over-priced, my fianc√©e opted for scallops which cost 34 dollars for only three of them served on some black rice, which looked like dead bugs. I got the filet and although it tasted good, it wasn't a mind blowing steak, for 49 dollars you expect it to be more flavorful. And finally, the billing, not so much the prices but when we first inquired about putting my friend's meal equally on all of our bills, the waiter said he could do it without a problem. However, when the checks came we realized the entire meal was on my bill, which we addressed with the waiter and he argued that it was impossible to split the bill up amongst the group. Very discouraged with the experience and the reputation of this place. I truly expected more out of it, but as you can tell it fell short. Some other side notes, the waiter attempted to be helpful but was overall rude with his significant attitude and lack of caring for our party, we also did not receive complementary bread either, nor did they offer us any desserts. Very very disappointed and I doubt I will ever go there again and I highly recommend that no one waste their time or money there. If you do, you will be disappointed."},{"name":"Taqueria Portland","address":"820 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Still great chips and salsa, margaritas moved over to sour mix not fresh squeezed limes anymore"},{"name":"Alana's Food & Wine","address":"2333 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I was expecting more from this restaurant, based on the on line reviews and from the write up in the local mag \\"Crave\\", which lists this as a top 10 dining spot in Columbus. I do like the decor, which is funky and relaxed, with colorful outsider art on the bright orange walls. We went with friends as a table of 4 and were seated right away, and I have no gripe with service; we got a good table from the host, and our server walked the line between professionalism and dry wit with adroitness. The menu is brief, as befits a restaurant that changes it's menu daily, and I appreciate the local ingredients, which was part of the draw for me in the first place. The food was well prepared, just not as exciting or inventive as I thought it was going to be. We started with the pork belly served over caramelized onion relish and a tempura with veggies and shrimp. Pork belly is usually over the top succulent, as it's very fatty, but this reminded me more of pork shoulder...it just had very little fat. Three of the four of us liked the onions, but Doug thought them too sweet. The tempura was good, but nothing to rave about, though we all liked the sauce that came with it. My friend Bill got the surprise entree listed on the menu...they don't tell you what it is, and you have to be okay with that. It ended up being a chicken breast in a traditional Indian korma with basmati rice...good, and a well executed korma, just very literal. I thought the same of Doug's entree, which was pork loin sliced and served wtih peanut satay. The sauce was good, but what I would expect to get at any decent Thai restaurant, so the chef here executes the classics well, but not with any flair or inventiveness that brands it as her own. Another friend had the spaghetti in a green pumpkin seed sauce, which reminded me of pipian, if you're familiar with Mexican food. This dish was a bit too spicy for my taste (I did taste everything...we all like to share and sample), and the large portion was too much the same thing bite after bite, so she only finished about half of it. This might be more successful in an appetizer portion. My entree was the winner...stripped bass pan sauteed and served over Moroccan flavored grated carrots with a citrus hollandaise. The carrots leant a sweetness and spiciness to the dish that was nice, the fish was done perfectly and the sauce was light and tasty. If I was rating Alana's on my dish alone, I would have given her 4 stars, but I was not wowed by much here, and would move on to other restaurants rather than return to this one."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A hidden gem.

Needless to say I was expecting stuffy service and tons of tourists. The tourists were still there by the Fung-wah busloads but the service was pretty down-to-earth and friendly. \\n\\nWe sat in the lounge and were seated in one of the best tables...right in the corner. This meant we had windows on two sides and as it was a lovely day I was very appreciative of our prime spot. We had no reservations (they don't take them for the lounge seating) so just happened to be lucky. The view IS what we came for after all, but the food was actually rather fantastic too. \\n\\nFirst Course was \\"Brie and Walnuts Baked with Dried Fruit Compote\\" ($13). I was in heaven. The flavours in this dish blew my mind. The cheese could have been slightly more melty but it's creaminess was a perfect complement to the sweetness of the figs (and fig sauce). \\n\\nCocktail was \\"Purple Rain Martini\\". This was pretty to look at but the taste was good, not great; slightly too much vodka so balance was a bit off. \\n\\nMain course was \\"Grilled Angus Burger with bacon, Vermont Cheddar Cheese, Caramelized Onions\\" ($15). This had sauteed mushrooms on the menu as well but I decided against that option since I don't care for them much. It came with a good-sized side of fries presented in a cool (although somewhat typical) conical device. Burger was cooked exactly the way I ordered (well done) but still retained some moisture. It is hard to do well-done meat and not dry it out; they passed this test. I love burgers and this one didn't disappoint. Could I have gotten a similar quality one elsewhere for a few dollars less?

For God sake this place is located in central Florida, the heart of the Florida citrus industry. There is absolutely no excuse to serve orange juice from concentrate.  I am not asking for fresh squeezed orange juice (if it was my place that is what you would get), but at least pick up some Tropicana from Publix. At $2.25 a glass you should be ashamed of yourself for serving that nasty stuff you do.

Pretty pricey for what was likely less than 1/3 pound of shrimp. She did not really like it much as the breading was thick and course. I would have to agree as it almost felt like you were scratching you mouth at times. I had the fishermans platter. It was fried and had way more calamari than anything in it. Otherwise it had 2 shrimp, 3 or 4 medium scallops, a few clam strips and a small pice of some sort of whitefish. It was probably cod. It was all ok but not the best. I wanted coleslaw as a side dish but they had run out. It is a seafood house! This is a staple for this type of place and it was noon time. Give me a break. We asked for Boston baked beans instead.

It also had a salad of mixed greens and pickled onions and bell peppers inside a crispy band of fried plantain.  I devoured up everything on the plate and the succulent lamb was perfectly cooked to my order.

In my opinion it is one of the reasons behind the \\"weird\\" in the saying \\"Keep Portland Weird\\".  I also give them a five star because they're not afraid to be daring and try really outlandish ways of turning a boring donut into something obscenely tasty while keeping the prices reasonable.  Prices range from $1 to $5 per donut.    \\n\\nSo far I have two favorites at this joint.  The first is the Triple Chocolate Penetration.  No...it isn't a porno title, it could be...actually it may have already been used but in this context...it isn't.  At Voodoo it is a chocolate cake donut with a coat of chocolate glaze topped with Cocoa Puffs...yes I said Cocoa Puffs.  The fine people over at Voodoo have a penchant for taking glazed donuts to new heights by topping the glaze with various cereals, cookies, candies, and even bacon.   You may have just asked yourself, \\"Did he just say bacon...on a donut???  Blasphemy!!!\\"  Yes, the infidels at this hole in the wall on 3rd Ave top one of their donuts with strips of bacon, but more on that later.  Let me go on to my second most favorite donut...the Marshall Mathers.  This donut is so named because it's topped with mini M&M's.  Do you get it?  Beneath the M&M's is a white glaze covering a vanilla cake donut.  Sugar overload?  Yes, yes it is, but I love it!  We ordered several dozen Slim Shadys for our son's birthday party last year instead of doing the traditional birthday cake and they were a hit with the keikis.  The crazies at Voodoo even made a chocolate version of the Marshall Mathers (yes, I've thought of a funny joke or two about it).  So instead of the standard vanilla they sub it with a chocolate donut with chocolate glaze and then the minis.  These guys and gals also do custom donuts.  In addition to the 5 dozen Eminems, we had them custom make a Nemo (Finding Nemo) donut.  They melded several yeast donuts into the shape of the cute little fish and got artistic with some orange glaze accented with black and white here and there and Presto Change-O, FISH DONUT!  The finished product looked just like the little fishee our son loves.  We were thoroughly impressed and highly recommend them for special events.  \\n\\nNow there are so many other donuts in the arsenal to try at this spot and I've only had the pleasure to sample a few.  I would love to sit down sometime and try them all but I also don't want the next Half Ton Man special on the Discovery Channel to feature yours truly.  So...I will have to choose wisely the next time we visit the place.  I really do want to try the Maple Bacon Bar, but I hear it is best to get it when the bacon is still freshly cooked.  Timing is everything.  I like my bacon crispy thank you.  The Memphis Mafia is another one on my hit list as well as the Dirty Snowballs.  The Memphis Mafia is an Elvis inspired creation and is larger than life like the legend himself.  The Dirty Snowballs...well, I'll just let your imagination run with it.  I will consume each in due time my friends, in due time.  I will be sure to update as I dispatch the sugary sweet prey.  \\n\\nThey opened a second larger location a while back just off of Sandy and Davis but the one on 3rd Ave in Old Town is open 24 hours.  Be warned...this doesn't mean they're making donuts the whole day.  These things are best sampled when they're fresh, especially the cereal topped ones.  Depending on the time of day, expect a line.  They don't take cards, cash only.  I believe there is an ATM inside, but of course it'll charge you a significant transaction fee.  Bring cash, spend the fee on a donut ;o)\\n\\nAs always, don't take my word for it.

The admissions area is very small and several groups were trying to check in at the same time.  Okay, busy Friday afternoon.  The rooms are really neat and old, but with old also comes loud.  Very tall ceilings, old walls and hardwood floors equal hearing your neighbors walk and talk.  There was also a wedding reception happening outside of our window that went on pretty late into the night that we had to listen to.  \\n\\nWe decided that since we were staying at a place with different bars and food options, we should utilize those options and stay on campus for dinner and drinks.  The Boiler Room bar is awesome, great atmosphere.  The food however was mediocre, room temperature pizza that took 45 minutes. \\n\\nBefore leaving for the airport on our last morning we decided it would be easier to eat at The Courtyard restaurant instead of driving around trying to find a place.  The majority of the tables were dirty and the food again took over 45 minutes to come out, (we ordered coffee and bagels.)  \\n\\nI recommend everyone check out The Kennedy School because it's a really cool building.  Go to The Boiler Room and have a drink.  I won't stay here again just because I found the noisy rooms and people outside the window annoying and the food/service quality isn't what I expect for $125 a night.  The noise factor could have been our particular room and bad luck with a wedding happening at the same time, however the service/food quality seems to be an ongoing theme."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"2nd visit here and again was a great one.

Somehow, we thought we would be above them. We weren't.\\n\\nThe night was so overcast we could not see the Prudential from the Pike.. strike one- should have switched course right then and there. We chose to press on thinking at least the food will be a treat.\\n\\nWhen we entered the atmosphere was lovely- relaxed, live mellow jazz playing, perfect lighting. They took our coats away to the coat check, and the maitre'd was kind when she asked my son to remove his hat. We are foodies by nature, but its rare we dress up ;-) \\n\\nAs it was overcast we could not see the lovely Boston lightscape below.. in fact the clouds were so thick the glass showed only grey, as though we were in a silvery basement-  It would have been a plus  for the hostess to work with this weather/view handicap and seat us facing INTO the dining room rather than at a drab shiny wall as is likely their usually wise habit.  ( no points off for them, we own the fact that we chose to dine there on such a rediculous night)\\n\\nOur waiter was sublime. Handsome, African sounding accent,  authentically polite with an easeful manner - he knew his wines, and kindly offered me the opportunity to sample a few to choose the right one for my meal.  He asked if we were celebrating anything- and bouyeed our spirits with a meaningful congratulations toward my son's birthday. \\n\\nWe delighted in a special little sample of the chef's muscle soup-- a sweet little unexpected treat brought out by another waiter compliment of the chef. It was a SUCH a delight in fact that our expectations for the meal ahead were affirmed. So we thought.\\n\\nThe beat salad, spinach salad, watery clam chowder were SO mediocre, honestly I thought I was eating at Applebees- over salted, under flavoured,  very generic, and overpriced for the fair. Simple dishes can and ought still be delightful.\\n\\nI chose not to order an Entree as a result.. My son ordered his favourite- lamb. It too was awkwardly presented with bland mashed potatoes and some unmemorable veg. He ate only a few bites. and asked for the check. We took it home and re-appropriated the left over into another dish.. not about to waste the cash we spent, but it really needed doctoring. eh.\\n\\nWe were so bummed out by the meal we did not stay for desert- can't say what we missed. \\n\\n\\nSo-- For service, very very high marks- worthy of its reputation for fine dining and why this has any stars at all. Low stars for being way too overpriced for the actual meal served. \\n\\nFor being made to feel special when dining out is a rate treat-- also many thumbs up.\\n\\nFor the actual Food- no stars. really- go to 99, chili's, applebees, etc.. and pay less... unless the actual chef who was making the sweet muscle soup is on duty..

Our waitress was prompt and attentive and plates were cleared right away, though not so we felt rushed.\\n\\nThe bad? The food was iffy. My wedge salad involved 3 romaine leaves (I counted), two very tasty tomatoes, about six bacon bits, and some amazing dressing. If there'd been an actual salad, it would have been delicious. \\n\\nThe entr√©es were good sized-- my husband's lamb chop was quite big and was quite tasty (this from someone who doesn't like lamb).

An amazing array of sushi as well as many izakaya-suited dishes presented so beautifully that you get the sense that these folks actually give a damn about what they are doing.\\n\\nThe room is modern but comfy, in the summer that counter along the window is a great place for people watching.

I was a little concerned it was overkill but the salmon at Tatsu is so unbelievably fresh (wild sockeye) that layering salmon and salmon actually worked for me, and the tataki salmon was no less juicy than the raw.\\n\\nI also had the Tatsu Hot Stone Bowl Donburi, a bibimbap with various slawed veggies and beef atop rice in a hot (and I mean HOT) stone bowl, of course with a little egg yolk in the middle to create texture.  The onions were cooked to al dente perfection retaining their sweetness, the beef was tender and juicy, the slawed veggies were fresh and the bowl was heated to such a high temperature that it was able to create that hard crusty rice that makes me order this dish in the first place. All served with a spicy sauce.\\n\\nAll dishes presented in artistic fashion, often with drizzled sauces and sliced fruit including strawberries! \\n\\nThe servers here are very pleasant, the girls are smiley, friendly and helpful. The only reason I do not give Tatsu 5 stars is I have found the service, specifically how the food comes out of the kitchen, to be uneven.

But when we did ask for our dessert maybe 20 minutes later (after a lot of trouble flagging down our server again), it was the EXACT same one. It had become room temperature and the crisp to the creme brulee had gotten soggy. I didn't mind too much but this was unbearable to some members at our table, so we asked our server for a new dessert. He gave us a weird look for asking.. we didn't think we were out of line or anything. But he agreed anyway, only to come back and say that was the LAST creme brulee of the night. So we took it anyway. At least it was comp'ed from our bill. Oh yeah.. and we never got our bread!!\\n\\n* The decor/ ambiance - 4 stars\\nReally really nice space, a ridiculously large space with really nice modern/asian decor. It's a little hard to find, seems to be in the middle of a high school parking lot, and Google maps brings you to a random side street that's physically close but not how to access the restaurant. \\n\\n* Pickle cocktail - 2 stars\\nForgot the name of this but it was pure liquor. No one could finish their drink.\\n\\n* Salmon chips - 4 stars\\n(loaded with short smoked salmon, chipotle cream cheese, capers, and red onion)\\nNot as exciting as it sounds - they are not chips actually made of salmon. It was shredded salmon on top of a potato chip. That being said, the salmon was really good, and the potato chip was great. A little on the salty side, but it was slightly burnt on the outside with a great crisp, and I thought the salmon was seasoned really well.\\n\\n* Duck & dumpling - 4 stars\\n(with gnocci, string beans, mushroom)\\nI actually really liked this while almost everyone else thought it was way too salty! It was overflavored a little, but I always prefer that to being underflavored. Still, everyone agreed the duck was incredibly tender and delicious, and the gnocci (what little there was) soft & delicious.\\n\\n* Watermelon salad - 2 stars\\nGood only because watermelon is always good. But it was really really plain. About 90% watermelon and 10% other ingredients (cheese, mint, etc). \\n\\n* Scallops & grits - 4 stars\\n(bronzed Sea Scallops served over smoked gouda grits in a tomato broth)\\nVery nice. The tomato broth really countered the richness of the grits well, it had a strong tangy flavor. The sea scallops were seared lightly and nice.\\n\\n* Brisket - 4 stars\\nTried a couple bites of my friends'. A little underflavored, but incredible texture & tenderness to the meat.\\n\\n* Ginger cookie creme broulee - 3 stars\\nThis was that trouble dessert I talked about above. Had we had it warm and fresh, 4 stars no question. But the crisp top layer was soggy and it wasn't warm anymore. But it had good flavor, and the ginger cookies were sofr & delicious and added a good contrast too the intense sweetness of the creme broulee.\\n\\n* Aple tart w/ ice cream - 3 stars\\nHad a bite of my friend's. Nice."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The service is AMAZING.

Yes, Mexican food is better in San Francisco than it is in Austin (see: queso.  Seriously, wtf?)  I was pleasantly surprised to find Lenoir -- local ingredients prepared with European influences?  Yes please.\\n\\nLenoir has by far the best meal deal in Austin -- any three courses for $35.  Yes, *any*.  None of that \\"salad is a course and you're going to like it\\" BS.  You want three main courses?  You get three main courses.  This would be double the price anywhere else in Austin; three times the price in San Francisco.  Want to take it to 11?  No problem, add any fourth dish for just $10.\\n\\nMe being the glutton I am, I picked three entrees (one fish, two meat) and a dessert.\\n\\npoha-crusted fish / butternut curry / pomegranate / corn:\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lenoir-austin?select=T2YDSWSZcB03a0smZZZXmQ\\nThis one was a total winner.  Lightly breaded fish on top a generous pile of butternut squash, pomegranate seeds, and corn.  The soup (bisque?) paired well with the fish.  Solid choice.\\n\\nspiced pork soup / mung bean noodles / ham jam / eggplant / herbs:\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lenoir-austin?select=QKHggxin9TEV2ved0IeX7g\\nDisappointing dish.  The waiter described this as a pork chorizo sausage, pork belly, and noodles.  He had me sold at the pork belly, but when I got it, it was just the salt-cured (?) lean part of the belly :(  Those of us familiar with pork belly as the savory layers of meat and fat will be sorely disappointed with this dish.  I'd skip this one, for sure.\\n\\nroasted leg of antelope / seared liver / turnip cake / radish & onion sofrito\\nThis one was total amazeballs.  Perfectly tender shank of antelope that's fork-tender and perfectly marinated. I forgot to take a picture of this dish, so my memory is a bit lost in the sea of awesomeness.  Californians missing out on foie should consider this dish.\\n\\nmelted texas raclette / spiced apple compote / pumpkin seed rusk\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lenoir-austin?select=NTgbjFEu0F6uEwp5Hv2JBw\\nThis isn't the boiled potatoes + metric ton of raclette that you get in France.  Nope, this is good sized pile of cooked spiced apples with some slices of raclette melted on top.  Served with a few slices of toast, this is the perfect balance of sweet and savory to finish off the meal.\\n\\nThis place is definitely a 4.5 stars, rounded down for the disappointing pork dish.  I'm sure I'll pass through Austin again in the future and will be back to try Lenoir.

We also tried the Uncle Hing wings and another kind but the name is escaping my mind right now. The wings are 10/10!

Also don't like it when servers have to say the name of the soup and splash saliva all on top of your soup. \\n\\nForgot to ask them if they have that dinner combo of the ramen soup with the salmon rice bowl. Will bring my friend next time to try. \\n\\nI also like how they have those baskets for people to put their bags in. There is always extra napkins on the table if you need them.

Due to my previous experience at Alana's, we were inclined to order mostly appetizers and a salad; all of which were very enjoyable.   My previous experience was with a very large party and, perhaps as a result, the entrees were not the same caliber as the appetizers, which were great both times. The service at the bar was pleasant and helpful while not being intrusive.  We arrived at shortly before 6 PM (when they open) and were happily seated before they technically opened.  Since we did not have reservations and seeing how crowded it got on a cold winter night when the streets were almost unsafe to drive on I would recommend making reservations if you want to be seated in the dinning area and arriving very early if you want to catch a seat at the bar."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Wouldn't be great if Portland had a REALLY GOOD doughnut shop?

I was very happy to have tried this great restaurant!\\nIt's small and the Pasquales menu isn't a huge one, but the food is really worth it!\\n\\nPasquales has two entrances, one at the front and one at the side. I came in the side entrance as it was closer to the parking lot behind the place. There was no wait at all. The server showed us to our table in the front of the restaurant. Pasquales has two areas to eat in as well. One is closer to the front of the restaurant and closer to the street, the other is near the back of the restaurant and closer to the restrooms and the kitchen. The back dining area is a bit larger and has a little more light and the front area, which I ate in, is kinda quaint and has more decor.\\n\\nAs for the decor, Pasquales is nicely decorated with framed photos of Otterbein College as well as a wedding that was held at Pasquales once. It also has nice rope lights and Italian decorations.\\n\\nThe menu was small, like I said, but it offered some great food. I had the pasta saccottino which is an Italian sausage dish covered in tomato sauce and cheese. It was great and really worth the price. I came with two other people who shared a pizza that had pepperoni and mushrooms on it. They told me that they loved it. I had an Italian sparkling water and a Cherry Coke to drink. One of the guys I came with had a Perroni beer and the other just had water. They had a good drink menu with lots of different beers and wines.\\n\\nPasquales had good service and helpful waiters who frequented the tables often. At one point while we were eating, the restaurant blew a fuse and the power went out on our side of the restaurant. We thought it was part of the atmosphere at first because the TVs stayed on as well as the rope lights and the lights in the other dining room. After a minute, though the manager went into a room in the middle of the restaurant and fixed it though so it only was off for about five minutes at most. Kinda funny in the end. Our waitress didn't even know about it and was surprised when we told her!\\n\\nThe restaurant delivers pizza and caters as well.

Disney has proven itself to be one of the cleanest family destinations in the world, but the Backlot Express seemed to have slipped through the cracks. Maybe I was there during a shift change or the eatery was more crowded than normal (wait time for tables were 5-10 minutes to locate an empty one). The tables and floors were covered in foodstuff. Spilled sodas and ice covered some areas on the floor. Maybe it's part of the ambiance? I'm also keeping in mind that this place is gigantic in comparison to the other fast-food places in other Disney parks.\\nThe service at the cashiers and the pick-up stations like everywhere else at Disney is quick and efficient.

As a native of Atlanta, I'm always meeting a lot of transplants that moved to Atlanta and have this misconception of the city. And with so many other restaurants that are always opening just as fast as they're closing it's hard to get people an insightful experience. And to be honest food in Atlanta is absolutely delicious. \\n\\nFor over 70 years in Atlanta this restaurant have always been a top choice for the people who live in the City of Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs. Now, parking can be a nightmare but if you don't mind parking a couple of blocks away then that'll be the worst part of your experience. Now I have to strongly urge you to NOT go here on a Sunday mid morning and later. That's when the church folks come from service and the restaurant becomes extremely busy and the wait (yes there's a wait) becomes unbearable. So best times to go is on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Just make sure that there's isn't any big event happening (i.e. proms, sports games, shows)\\n\\nHowever, I urge you to stick through the wait because once you're seated you are going to get a notepad to write your order down. But just know this is real souther food. So everything is tastier and the portion sizes are exactly what you'd expect. And by the time you and your group are finished with your entr√©e and you're waiting for dessert suddenly you are struck by the itis (colloquial for a food coma, after dinner dip, or postprandial sleep)\\n\\nI've been there several times in my life and I've never had a bad experience here. And after I told someone that they should experience the food they are absolutely surprised. I can honestly say that the food is much more delicious than Sweetie Pies in St. Louis.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a place where the locals will go to without hesitation then this is the place! You're going to have an authentic southern experience without it being disingenuous by the charm and the food."},{"name":"Brooklyn Pizza","address":"1647 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This place is the best pizza slice in Boulder.

The dessert (I had the butterscotch pudding, and tried the saltimbocca and biscotti) was out of this world - too rich to finish. I would prefer the biscotti to be like the real thing, not so interpreted, but whatever. One down side was the cappuccino - I like a dark roast and this one was just a little acidic /bitter somehow, not so pleasant. But my companion said her latte was the best she'd ever had. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere, while yes noisy and crowded, is hip and interesting, clean and modern.\\n\\nOne point of annoyance. I understand (after hearing the spiel) why you don't slice the pizza. But if you are sharing with people, which everyone is, it means you either tear messily or cut with your own knife, much less pleasant than just having a clean slice.

I'm not sure there is anything quite like eating bun cha at the little shop on Hang Manh in Ha Noi, but I was willing to give it a shot. I've missed the delicious grilled pork patties that define bun cha.  \\n\\nLuckily for me, they nailed it. The grilled meat's taste is so close to that in Ha Noi that I can only shout praises for it.  They like to serve it on a platter, but I prefer it the way I know... in a bowl.  Just dump it all together: nuoc cham, meat, bun and some vegetables. Squeeze a little  lime over it and it's Vietnamese heaven in a bowl. \\n\\nI wasn't as impressed with their pho ga; the taste was great, but I prefer the thicker, flat noodles over the skinny vermicelli. The bun bo Hue was good, but not wonderful.  Again the noodles aren't my favorite, but it tasted good, just enough spicy bite  and loads of vegetables; it was fairly similar to the soup I'd eaten in Hue.  \\n\\nThey offer homemade yoghurt that is simply the best I've had.  For my son's birthday we ate there and enjoyed young coconuts, pho, bun cha, and summer rolls.  \\n\\nIf you're vegetarian, make sure to ask that *all* meat gets removed, not just the meat listed on the menu item itself.

Some will be downright confrontational with me, which will immediately tell me they have not lived in the above mentioned or have not done the extensive eating in the soup dumpling field (Xiaolongbao) as I have.  Enough about me, but the background was necessary.\\n\\nI want to be clear I have only tried 3 dishes and all had issues. \\n\\n1st) Xiaolongbao or Shanghai pork soup dumplings:  after all the local buzz and hype about XLB and this dish, The authors should be fired for negligence.   While they are one of the closest I've seen in Portland to an authentic one, its like a 3 compared to some of the best rated at 10 in major cities as far as authenticity goes. Here is why, the thickness of the dumpling is too thick, but I would say I've definitely seen worse.  2/3) The actual soup flavor and pork substance is just so average 4) piping hot is a must.  You can't serve these even one minute past piping hot or you don't understand the journey.  5) lastly, the amount of juice created by the pork and special ingredients needs to produce more juice. The good news is with a few tweaks here and there they could improve very easily \\n\\n2nd) the saut√©ed green veggie dish.  Just a total failure in flavor, and how they incorporate the ingredients. No need to spend more time on this dish. Anyone at home can toss a few veggies in some hot oil with salt, garlic, pepper and crush these guys \\n\\n3rd) noodles with pork and shrimp.  Not a total failure, taste was common to other asian places that prepare this dish, noodles done well enough, but very oily(common mistake) and you MUST cook the pork until all pink is gone from the center pf minced pork. You also must cook shrimp until the pink vibrance shows up, the grey translucency turns more white and no clear fleshiness. Again, easy to fix this dish, so hopefully they do. \\n\\nI'm stuck between 2-3 starts. My extra star would be the kind staff and the fact that I only had these three dishes. I'm happy to review it again for an upgrade in a few months and see if they listened at all.  They should study the dumpling a little better in Chinatown NYC or Hong Kong.

Period. \\n\\nI've eaten as so many great places where the food is top notch, but typically the service doesn't leave as much of a last impression. At The Bancroft, the food was outstanding, and so was the service.\\n\\nOur waiter Bob not only was friendly, helpful, accommodating, and attentive, but he genuinely seemed pleased to be serving us. I was set on ordering something else on the menu, but my curiosity about why the Steak Au Piovre was the only thing in the menu in a different color font (turns out that do it wine instead of cognac - and it's the chef's favorite dish) led me to ask about it.  His own personal enjoyment of a dish came through so well in his recommendation that I actually ordered instead, and I'm glad I did. Literally an above and beyond experience - the only thing they didn't do for me was actually put the food into my mouth. \\n\\nThe Bancroft also sports one of the largest and most interesting cocktail menu. The Painkiller was a delicious cousin of the Pina Colada with some added Orange, served in a Hawaiian glass. My wife enjoyed her Blood Orange Sangria, and I was happy to see that when I asked for a glass of Bourbon on the rocks that I was instead offered a \\"king's cube\\" instead of traditional rocks. \\n\\nIt was very difficult to choose starters or even a salad as everything on the menu caught my eye. Unfortunately, I know I have eyes bigger than my stomach so I forced myself to settle on the Baked Clams with bacon crumb and the Wild Arugula and Treviso salad with Balsamic and Fried Goat Cheese. It was the goat cheese that sold me on the salad and it was so much better than my tastebuds had anticipated. Lightly crisp on the outside and warm, creamy, tangy, and salty on the inside. They also have a raw bar, and I was definitely tempted to order the Shrimp Cocktail. \\n\\nFor entree I did end up with the Steak Au Piovre as recommended, which arrived perfectly medium-rare as I had requested. The red wine reduction was delicious and slightly acidic and refreshing while the bone marrow it's served with was buttery, brothy, and savory. Sides are a la carte, so I decided to get the bag of French fries to try the house made ketchup and fried Rosemary. \\n\\nTo end, we had a made-to-order chocolate cake with a warm espresso cream center, served with vanilla gelato. But truly you couldn't go wrong with anything on the dessert menu...\\n\\nOr really the entire menu for that matter. There wasn't a single item that didn't sound delicious, or if it didn't immediately strike my own palette at a glance, it was at least interesting enough that I'd gladly give it a try. This goes for everything from cocktails, to entrees and everything in between. \\n\\nI also found the decor to be a mismatched mix of rustic and modern that just somehow worked perfectly to create a setting and atmosphere that could fit any occasion or mood - romantic, business, or trendy. \\n\\nI'll say it again, The Bancroft might be unrivaled when you measure the full dining experience.

They had the food out within fifteen minutes, not one dish was missed.  They had those cards processed and we got to the show with ten minutes to spare!!

I love giardiniera, thanks to my dad's Chicago side of the family, and it's even better than I thought it would be on pizza.  The burger was great- well cooked with all the regular toppings, which made it a solid choice.  The fries were so delicious, they were perfectly fried and salted, and since the Rossi uses Yukon Gold instead of Idaho, the fries are even more luscious in texture.  If that doesn't do it for you, then the basil-lemon aioli might have to.  It's great.\\n\\nNot only was our food spot on, but our server was amazing too.  She was helpful and funny and immediately asked if we wanted our entrees to be split, which rarely happens anymore.

I was in that \\"I just wanna lay in bed and watch TV mood\\" and just wanted to bail on dinner, but I'm so glad I didn't.  I've been wanting to try it literally for years now and actually suggested the place to my friend when she asked me for a good spot to have her birthday dinner.  I could kick myself for not making it here sooner.  From the valet, to the live band to the general ambiance  from the moment I walked in I forgot the weather and my mood were sucky.

It's crisp and tasty on the outside but light and tender, not hard and spongy, rubbery or tough.  Who knew the true texture of calamari is supposed to melt in your mouth?

It seemed like they weren't quite cooked enough - not that perfect degree of both crispy/soggy that makes the best fry (in my opinion). My boyfriend enjoyed his burger with chili and the side of fries. After stealing a couple, I concluded that the regular fries were definitely better than the sweet potato fries. We finished off with shakes - I had the \\"Puddin' Out\\" boozy shake. I am certainly not a lightweight in the alcohol department, but this one was so strong that I could only tolerate a few sips.

The chicken is great and the pasta is pretty decent as well. I enjoy using the phone app because I can see what stage my order is in (which is mostly helpful so that I know just how much time I've got to find my wallet), and since I'm a bit geeky I also have the app that tracks it on my watch. The best way to order seems to be online since you can find a bunch of really good coupons. The one my wife and I use most often is the one that lets you pick two different items for 5.99$ each. We typically get two two topping medium pan pizzas which is enough food for three meals a piece for us.

They have a beautiful location with a gorgeous patio, and the hotel itself is a little off the beaten path in Winter Park, so it's not the \\"see and be seen\\" that Luma can be sometimes. The service was attentive and enthusiastic, and the food was well-executed. The prices for the food were inflated, considering that you can get more creative dishes for less money at places like Ravenous Pig, Luma, and Cress. But they did what they did well.\\n\\nWe sat on the patio and were immediately greeted very enthusiastically. Water came quickly, as did our drinks. We didn't love the cocktails we ordered (we think the bourbon was left out of one of them and they were too sweet. The server put a \\"bourbon topper\\" on one of them. Mine sat mostly untouched and the server noticed but never suggested something else. (This was really minor, but the same thing has happened at the Pig and the server immediately took it away and brought me something better, so a tiny improvement in this regard wouldn't hurt). \\n\\nThe rolls were utterly delicious, accompanied by bacon butter. Yes, bacon butter, which was also delicious. My husband doesn't eat bacon, and the server immediately brought regular butter for him. \\n\\nThe beet salad came with rave reviews (salt roasting! Milk bath!); it was good, with pumpkin seeds and goat cheese, but not world-changingly good (the Gatherer Salad at the Pig is still the best beet conveyer in town, IMHO). The kale Caesar was nice--a large portion, very young kale, a light dressing; no anchovies, though. \\n\\nWe both had the grouper for dinner. The portions were large, the fish was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin. The fish sat on top of mashed something (maybe a 5 grain risotto, if that is really a thing and I'm remembering correctly), with root vegetables (not overcooked, yay), and with baby greens on the plate. I couldn't finish the fish, the portion was so large.\\n\\nSo, the food was good and the server was bursting with enthusiasm. In addition, people whisked dirty plates away like it was their job (which it actually was, I think)--and if you read my other reviews, you know that not busing is a major pet peeve (see my Funky Monkey review). The atmosphere was lovely, the pacing was great. The price point was a little ridiculous, though. Beef medallions are $45 and I'm not kidding about that. The fish was something like $30, maybe $37. Now, look, I am willing to pay for good food and service, and I know hotel restaurants are a little pricier. But I have eaten at some truly stupendous hotel restaurants (Proof on Main at 21C in Louisville as exhibit #1) and their prices do not approach this, and their food is far more exciting. So my main complaint is prices. I get this is Orlando and we love to charge more for less, but come on. So the trick next time will be figuring out whether the patio, the service, and the well-executed food are worth the price, or whether I should settle for less atmosphere and more interesting food for less money at Cress, Ravenous Pig, or Luma."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It is almost the New Year.

Baked ricotta is quite nice, as is the prosciutto & mozzarella. The brussels sprouts and baked squash were just okay. Ambiance is pleasant. Also worth noting that I didn't have a pizza, which is their specialty, but I've heard good things.\\n\\nNow to the drama: The Backspace advertises \\"half-price antipasti at Happy Hour\\" but our server never told us and then proceeded to charge us full price for four of them. Getting the bill corrected was a major hassle that resulted in hours of wasted time. The meal was otherwise fine--but if you dine at this restaurant, please check your bill for similar errors. And if you need your bill adjusted, don't be shocked if the manager rudely blames you for their mistake. Sad to say, we won't be back.\\n\\n\\nFull version: Upon arriving at 5:10 for Happy Hour, our server told us wine was half-price but never mentioned discounted pricing for antipasti; subsequently we were charged full price. \\"Well,\\" we figured, \\"they must have changed their policy.\\" We ate, paid and left.\\n\\nWhen we arrived home, we checked their website and realized they had screwed up. After three emails with the general manager, they agreed to adjust that section of the bill. Fair enough, even though that meant having to schlep back downtown for our money because I paid in cash. Upon arriving, I did get the partial discount applied but was terribly disappointed in the experience. Between the emails, driving, and then finally finding parking, this was a major inconvenience. So I was pretty shocked when the manager asked, \\"Well, did you check your bill when they gave it to you? That's why they give it to you first.\\"\\n\\nThat was totally unfair. Sure, it's the job of a patron to know what they ordered when examining the bill; but it's the job of good restaurant to train their waitstaff properly so that they know the prices, and rectify the problems without first blaming the customers. I understand mistakes happen, but this overcharging debacle was not our fault. Management then blamed the computer system, but the real culprit was the human error by the waiter who never told us about the pricing, and never corrected the bill. We did finally get our partial refund; and after I defended myself from the manager's accusations, she offered me a card for a free pizza and appetizer. But it was tough not to feel bummed about the whole experience. It was a botched night out.\\n\\nWith so many other phenomenal food options in downtown Austin, I won't be back--even with the free card. If you do dine at The Backspace, please make sure to double-check your bill, especially at Happy Hour."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"632 N E Weidler Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"1.5","text":"Well, Burger King on Weidler screwed the pooch royally, again!!! I was in 2 weeks ago...see my review:\\n\\nI've had people be rude to me, but nothing tops this joint. I was in Tues 10/3/17 @ 2:15 pm. The place wasn't busy except for a few cars in the drive up. There was NO ONE at the counter except me. ¬†I stood at the counter for 4 minutes with only the girl at the window ¬†acknowledging my presence - wow, she smiled at me!! After 4 minutes, I loudly spoke up, \\"I'm trying to place an order, will someone come and help me?\\" The only thing that happened is that the workers started chattering away in Spanish. After 2 more minutes of being totally stinking ignored while the workers yattered on and on, I lost my temper, shouted, \\"I wanted to place a ******* order! **** you all!!\\" and I left. \\n\\nWhen I tried to call the store to complain to the manager, all I got was a recorded message saying that the cell phone I was calling wasn't accepting calls!! I called 4 times to make sure I was dialing the right number, which I was. Some lousy stinking customer service!!\\n\\nI finally called BK HQ and filed a complaint. I am still waiting to hear back from them. They did say that the number listed on their website for the BK I went to was the correct number. Some contact number, sheesh! When/if (more likely IF) I do hear from someone at BK, I'll update my review, either positively or negatively, whichever they deserve. \\n\\nI likely will never eat at Burger King again. Total Stinking Rudeness! Extremely Disappointed. Disgusted, even. ¬†\\n\\nOh, and the doors to the joint are broken and have been broken for at least a month!!! Good maintenance - NOT!!! ¬†\\n\\nEDIT, 10/6/17, 5:30 PM PDT:\\n\\nI just received a call from the new manager at this BK shop. I believe her name is Christa (I hope I didn't mishear her name & mangle the spelling). We had a nice chat where she apologized for the crew's errors, we talked about how the incident can be used as a learning experience for her employees, and she invited me back so she could, \\"wow me\\". I plan on giving her the opportunity. \\n\\nTo be honest, I *wasn't* expecting to hear back from BK, so Christa's call was a very pleasant surprise. I really do like the BK Whopper, so if all goes well the next time I go in, I won't have to forgo one of my favorite flavors. \\n\\nI really like the positive message Christa has - \\"using the incident as a learning experience\\"... Instead of just yelling at or firing someone, she will give further training and demand improvements. No one has to lose their job - just get better at it. That works for me!\\n\\nI provisionally change my star rating to 2 stars, with more uprating possible.\\n\\n*NOTE: I shouldn't have upgraded my star rating from 1 star to 2 stars; it's obvious that no lessons about customer service, courtesy, and respect were made or paid attention to.\\n\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nWent in today, October 18, 2017, and guess what? There were 3 people already in line, no one serving at the counter, and the manager was in the dining area ratchet-jawing with someone who later ID'ed himself as \\"Paul\\", the manager's supervisor. I asked the 3 guys in front of me how long they had been waiting, and was told, \\"a long time.\\"  I had to break up the manager's little chat-fest to get the her (Christa, I think her name was) to go to the counter and help the Long-waiting customers!!!\\n\\nLong & short of it (because I'm still so pissed at the rudeness & disrespect shown to paying customers, I don't want to have to again relate the whole story) ... when I called Paul on the phone (not the one listed on their website - that takes you to a cell phone which isn't accepting calls) to complain of the rudeness and lack of service, TWICE in a row, he told me that if I wasn't happy, then to not come back at all!!!\\n\\nFine! I'll NEVER get food at Burger King again! Not now, not later, .... NEVER AGAIN! Don't give me a gift certificate, I'll burn the damn thing!\\n\\nI did call BKHQ and filed a complaint - which the phone person said will go to the District Manager ... whoopee! Paul-the-Rude will probably get nothing more than a \\"shame on you!\\" and maybe a slap on the wrist. Not enough correction for piss-poor service, rudeness and disrespect!\\n\\nThe only thing which MIGHT get me back into a BK is a published apology (on my FB page, for instance) from everyone in the BK chain-of-command including Paul & Christa, a nice donation of money or food from Paul & BK to, say, a Woman's Domestic Abuse Shelter, or perhaps an anti-obesity program for youth, or maybe Portland Rescue Mission (they can decide who and what & how much, I am not trying to extort anything from anyone for my personal gain), and retraining for BOTH Christa & Paul, emphasizing etiquette, respect for others including customers, and perhaps anger management!\\n\\nWhat's-their-name burger joint around the corner on Grand will get my business from now on!"},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to lunch here today!

This is a really fun place. The donuts are fun, the gold glitter sprayed brick outside is fun, the excitement is fun, the box is fun, etc etc. This is totally a tourist trap if you like cutesy semi unique things - making me a giant sucker for this place. \\n\\nI came here on Sunday of Labor day weekend so naturally the line was ridiculous. I'm sure its normally ridiculous though. I spent an hour in line. For donuts. Kind of crazy but I knew I was in for it. We had stopped by around noon but decided to walk around and get coffee first, and then came back around 330. The line was still the same length but thats what I was expecting. They really could use some signage or a greeter to direct people to where the line starts. It was confusing and I wasn't the only one who felt that way. I also feel like it would have been more useful to post the menu on the window in addition to their sign telling you to check the menu online. \\n\\nThis place is cash only, but there is an atm if you forgot. I got a dozen donuts that I picked myself and it cost me 25 dollars and some change. I didn't get any sort of discount for getting a dozen, so don't feel pressured into getting a dozen unless you want that many. \\n\\nVoodoo Doll - I was surprised by how much I liked this. I'm not usually one for filled donuts, but this was good. The chocolate and the raspberry married well together. I was glad that I got two of these.\\n\\nBacon Maple Bar- Yuck. One of the people in front of me in line was raving about this and how you had to get one. I figured I'd like it because I LOVE maple bars. I like bacon. I like when my maple syrup gets on my bacon. But I did not like this. I had half of it and threw it away. Wish I had only got one of these.\\n\\nFruit Loops - I was really excited about this one but the fruit loops were stale. Buh. =[\\n\\nMarshall Mathers - Ok I had to get this one. Plus I love m&ms. Very sweet, but what I expected.\\n\\nMemphis Mafia Donut - I really liked this one, possibly my favorite out of the bunch. It was also really sweet and intense though, this ended up getting eaten in four different segments. I think this was sort of a banana fritter with peanut butter drizzle and chocolate chips. I'm not usually a peanut butter person but this was great.\\n\\nChocolate Orea and Old Dirty Bastard were pretty standard and what I was expecting.\\n\\nI had a couple more that I gave away because I prioritized the others for eating myself. I really wanted the peach fritter, but they were out and I was super disappointed about that. As far as service the girl didn't really smile but she wasn't grumpy with me - but I also rattled off what I wanted and didn't stand there trying to decide. I mean really we were in line for an hour, the menu is available online, and some people seemed to have no idea what they wanted. \\n\\nThe donuts overall were really delicious, there were tons of fun options, and for specialty baked goods I felt like the prices were pretty reasonable. Don't feel pressured into getting a full dozen unless you want that many. Don't forget your cash, and be prepared for a stupid long line.
