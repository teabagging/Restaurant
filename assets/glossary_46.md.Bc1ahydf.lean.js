There were also boxes and boxes of unwashed produce right on the restaurant floor, stacked up as tall as I am against a wall. And the service was terrible.

Then when our food came, we asked for another drink and it never arrived, no one ever came to check on us while we were eating, and we had to flag someone down for the check.The food was well prepared, but between the filth in the bathroom, the low standard of cleanliness in the dining room, and the poor service, I will never set foot in this restaurant again.

It's not as sweet as you would expect, and the BBQ sauce ties it all together.  \\n\\nVibe: The whole place is great, we went around 4 pm on a Saturday,the outside patio was pretty full but there was plenty of seating inside.  We grabbed a seat at the bar. They had rock music cranking through the speakers and the Braves game as well as the college world series playing on the TV's. A good mix of college kids, and some old guys like me at the bar, It's very casual, shorts and T Shirt kind of place. \\n\\nStaff:  We were immediately greeted by a friendly bar tender, and she took care of us the whole afternoon. My wife asked the bartender to make her a good \\"summer\\" cocktail, (A risky move, no doubt), and she came back with the ginger lemonade.  My wife loved it! \\n\\nDrinks:  I was a bit disappointed in their draft beer selection, but they have a wide selection of bottled beers.  I had 4 beers and 3 of them came in an 11 oz. glass, I'm not sure why.  The good news is, I've been dragging my wife around to all of these beer places and she prefers cocktails, and like I mentioned earlier, she absolutely loved the ginger lemonade, she also had the southern margarita, and the red lemonade. She loved them all.\\n\\nFood: The burger is so good I had to lead with that!  You will not be disappointed if you go with the sublime burger, I promise.  My wife had the fish and chips, and she found them to be a delight.  \\n\\nParking: We found a metered parking spot, $4 for an hour and 45 min. right next to the place.  It was very easy, probably because of the time of day we went, but there is plenty of metered parking as well as a parking garage that charges $5 an hour during the day.\\n\\nOverall, this place is definitely worthy of 4 stars in my opinion.

Mississippi street has some of my favorite spots in Portland, and we have passed this restaurant a million times, yet never really gave it a second thought.  I was so pleasantly surprised by this place, and I am so excited we decided to give it a try.  \\n\\nI enjoyed almost every aspect of the restaurant.  The space is smaller, but the building is a converted warehouse, so the vaulted ceilings lend a fantastic open feeling.  There are various sizes of tables to accommodate any number of dinner party, as well as a separate area in front of the bar where you can dine \\"living-room style,\\" complete with plush couches and a small center table (four women were actually sitting on the floor around the table enjoying their dinners and chatting the night away when we were in, adding to the warm ambiance).  We arrived around 7pm on a Friday night, and were promptly greeted.  The restaurant was full, but we were the first in line for the next table.  We headed to the adorable bar in the back of the restaurant (6 bar stools) and ordered a much-appreciated reasonably price bottle of Chianti for $18 (try finding that at many other decent Portland restaurants).  The vibe inside is totally homey and relaxed, and you feel completely comfortable.  Italian-inspired postcards are scattered underneath the simple glass-top tables throughout the dining area, covering the traditional red/white checkered Italian tablecloths.   After roughly 20-30 minutes we were seated at a small table next to the bar.  Water was cleverly served in recycled wine bottles, and the complimentary bread baskets contained pieces of two types of fresh Italian loaves.  After reading all the wonderful reviews from other Yelpers, it was hard to decide what to order, but here is how we ended up:\\n\\nAntipasti: \\nAntipasti della Casa - marinated olives, roasted mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, pickled cipollini onions, fresh mozzarella, mortadella, & cannellini bean puree.  This was a nice size starter plate to enjoy with our wine...the sundried tomatoes made the dish!\\n\\nPrimi e Secondi:\\n1) Grilled Layered Chicken & Eggplant Parmesan served on top of garlic bruschetta.  What I loved about this dish was that it was not your typical pound of chicken and cheese, soaked in breading and oil.  This was a nice size organic chicken breast, served on top of tender eggplant, all layered on a nice piece of crunchy bruschetta.  Texture heaven!  \\n2) Penne Puttanesca with capers, olives, garlic, anchovies & onions in a spicy tomato sauce.  What a great blend of flavors this was, with a nice little kick in the aftertaste.  The sauce was light and the dish was filled with veggies.  \\n\\nDesert:  We asked the server how large the portions were because they were so cheap ($3 for tiramisu!, $4 for many others), and she said very small.  In actuality, splitting one tiramisu would have been the perfect end to our large Italian meal.  However, we also ordered a piece of the chocolate cake...god forbid we not get enough sweet stuff!  \\n\\n1) Tiramisu - Creamier than usual, perfectly layered, flavors balanced - delicious!\\n2) Chocolate cake - Rich, luscious chocolate cake with slivers of chocolate cr√®me down the center - need I say more?  Chocoholics beware!\\n3) Drip Coffee - Bold taste and the exact match for these Italian treats.\\n\\nThe service was less than exceptional, but by no means rude.  I think they were just trying to turn tables, but you should never try to pull plates from people that are clearly still working on and enjoying their meals, it was a bit annoying.  The portions here are great, of course more than you need, but not too much to leave you feeling incapacitated at the end of the meal.\\n\\nThis is the perfect place for a reasonably priced (yet impressive) date, or to take those family members who would be uncomfortable at some Portland's more upscale Italian establishments.  It will satisfy everyone, without a doubt.  This is our new go-to Italian, for now :)"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"if you are staying downtown especially the W, this place is a must. walking distance and a real souther eat. \\nget fried green tomatoes to start. pork chops or shrimp &grits for the main dish.\\nheaven."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"AMAZING!!!!!!

The parking lot is a disaster and it won't be long before someone trips over those large cracks and hurts themselves. There was a rather large man who tripped and nearly fell but was able to catch his balance. \\n\\nNow to the food and service. Our first waitress was tired or depressed, we switched tables and was given another waitress, Sam. Sam was vibrant and exuberant and sold us on everything. We ordered two of the combo meals and I ordered the trio combo meal, I choose the wings with sauce, ribs, and sliced brisket (lean), with sides of Mac n cheese, Collard greens and potato salad (extra $5) and jalape√±o cornbread (extra $2) the meal comes with only 2 sides. \\n\\nThe wings we were told were their award winner along with the ribs. The wings were extra salty and otherwise just wings nothing special. The ribs were good and easy enough to eat if one was without teeth. The brisket was also average nothing memorable, I wish I would have gotten the chopped brisket, hubby just told me the chopped brisket wasn't all that special.\\n\\nThe mac n cheese is a kiddie mac and cheese meaning its very cheesy, stove top and not baked. Its not gross but its not Down South Southern cooking. When I saw the shells I knew it was over, yes shells not macaroni. \\n\\nThe collards were great a little sweet, never had them like this before, but they were good.

I'm pretty bummed that I didn't get to try both, but I had their sashimi and one of their \\"burgushi\\" rolls...and I must say, their sushi game is on point! \\n\\nI ordered two things off their menu: Doug's filet roll and the 15-piece sashimi platter. The sashimi platter was delicious, and beautifully presented as well! It's a lot of sashimi so I would recommend sharing, and that way you can also try some other things on their menu! There was a good variety of fish: tuna, salmon, clam, yellowtail, octopus, etc. The clam was amazing and definitely my favorite from this dish. The rest of the sashimi was also delicious. The fish was super fresh and the ice platter they were served on made sure that they were at a nice cool temperature throughout the whole meal. I would highly recommend getting this dish if you want to experience a good variety of all of their sashimi. \\n\\nThe roll I got was also very good--and it was unlike anything I've ever had before. This roll was under the \\"burgushi\\" section in their menu. It's a fusion of meat and sushi, so instead of traditional fish in the sushi, it was seared filet mignon instead. The filet mignon was on top of the sushi roll, actually, and the inside of the roll had avocado, cream cheese, and other stuff that I can't really recall. It was topped with a spicy mayo sauce. It was a very interesting mix, but I really enjoyed it! The filet mignon went surprisingly well with the rice, seaweed, and the rest of the roll. It's pretty filling and heavy, but very delicious and one of the best modern takes on sushi that I've had! \\n\\nOverall, I really like this place! I wish they had branches on the west coast.

I had no idea what/how much food I needed, but the catering manager spent about 30 minutes on the phone with me going through all their options before finally helping me make a decision. This usually wouldn't be a big deal, and I would actually kind of expect it, but this was the Friday before the holiday and she was slammed with orders, phone calls, and emails. She could have easily sent me away and told me to plan better next year - but she didn't. Thanks for all your help and we won't forget it! \\n\\nThe food - We ordered meat (no sides) for about 20 people and got a mix of pulled pork and baked chicken. 5 pounds of the pork and 8 chickens (halved) was the perfect amount of food - I would order the same amount if I had it to do over again. The order came with a lot of Fox Bros BBQ sauce and sturdy serving trays. Everyone loved the BBQ meats and I have to say that it was some of the best pulled pork I have ever eaten. \\n\\nIf you find yourself looking to have your party catered and need someone to really come through for you - give Fox Bros a call.

Usually I'd prefer the host telling us the wait time ahead of time but it wasn't that big of a deal to sway me from coming back. We were seated by the servers station which isn't ideal because of the constant dish slamming of uneaten food from other customers. I should've known better once I saw an entire pulled pork sandwich make its way to the trash that I was not about to be satisfied. I gave them two stars based off of the amazing Texas fries appetizer we ordered. It was a little too cheesy but besides that it was delicious. The mac and cheese was watery as well as the spicy green beans and my friend's ribs were tough. Not a God sign in a BBQ establishment. My pulled pork was not pulled at all, it should've just said pork shoulder with no sauce. My baked beans were a little spicy but doable and the potato salad tasted way too tangy.

It was pouring rain out, so luckily for us the line snaked from the front door up to their covered outdoor seating. The girlfriend and I got some choice seats at a picnic table next to a heating lamp. While others had coolers full of beer, we were content killing time with our Kindle and DS. Though when one of the employees came around selling beer, it was hard to resist. Pro tip: While there is a big line, you can run inside to use the bathroom.\\n\\nDoors opened at 11am, but we didn't even get to the front of the line to order until at least an hour later.

But after carefully examining the ribs, I was just like, \\"alright\\". \\n\\nthe ribs come slightly dry with some heavy smoke taste. The ribs are cooked with Hickory smoke and are St. Louis style ribs. I'm a huge sauce guy so I started to pour their original BBQ sauce on the ribs. Their original sauce is sweet with a good amount of brown sugar. I did like their sauce but I loved their spicy one better because it was vinegar base with a nice kick. It was more watery rather than their original base which is thick and sticky. I would grade their ribs a C+\\n\\nThe sides are huge! I did like their Tomminator;tots smothered in their Brunswick sauce and a load of melted cheese. This was a nice pair because I was getting my potato fix.

They could've made it a bit more creamier rather than plain pickled cabbage with a bitter taste. \\n\\nTheir sweet tea was also a bit too sweet. They need to control the sugar on that lol.

That's why you have to approach the \\"waiting in line\\" as a fun, positive experience. Bring some chairs (or come early enough to snag some that are underneath the stairs), some cards, and some drinks. It's like a little party because you get to meet people and there are people from all around the world. My friend gave me a great first time experience at Franklin's; we pretty much tailgated in line for a few hours and we were one of the first ones to get our food. The PR of Franklin's also made everyone feel welcomed by chatting with people throughout the morning with a big smile on his face.\\n\\nNow, is it worth it?\\n\\nI would say yes. Just seeing the meat on the table is a sight to see. The photos on here don't do it justice. The meat is literally dripping with juices as they slice it up and serve you. I got a pound of ribs and a pound of brisket, along with a side of cole slaw and a key lime pie. I ate about half of it at the restaurant and brought the other half home (if I'm going to stay in line that long, I'm going to make the food last!). The sauce enhances the meat for sure. My friend also got the sausage and it was probably some of the best sausage I've ever had. The service is also excellent; they actually messed up my order and to make up for it, they gave me a free pie. They also gave my friend a free sweet tea instead of making her wait in line again after she got her food. \\n\\nSo remember, if you go, make an experience out of it and plan ahead of time. When should you show up? If you show up at 7am, you'll be waiting on the ramp near the front door (first ones to get in). By 8am, you'll still be under the covered area, definitely get food. By 9am, you'll be in the parking lot and its likely you'll get food. By 10am, you will probably have to go home.

It's at a really good location, right on Newbury Street. \\n\\nAs for food, nothing was really amazingly good, but I thought the wild mushroom popcorn was almost addicting to eat. The mushroom pizza was decent. Needed some of that tomato flavor. The chicken drumsticks were also tasty, but needed some more meat. However, the presentation of the chicken looked good, appearance reminded me of some lamb chops. I also had a Cubano sandwich. The bread was toasty and I liked the cheese. We were also given some shrimps and these cooked prunes wrapped in bacon. They were also fairly tasty. Decent place to grab some appetizers but are kind of pricey looking at the menu. \\n\\nThe best part of this place is probably the cocoa drink they serve from the bar. Although it's $10, this special drink has Bellagio chocolate mixed with some Amaretto. It is doused with whipped cream and topped by a cherry. A great choice during a cold night. It's pretty good, I haven't had a great chocolate drink since drinking a really good chocolate milkshake from a diner when I was in middle school. Loved the richness of the chocolate, gave my tongue a nice feeling of rapture. This is the kind of rapture you would probably get when you find out that a really gorgeous girl really wants to hang out with you and you really want to hang out with her often. I really suck at giving dating advice, but if you know a really gorgeous girl that loves drinking cocoa and she is feeling cold you should buy her one if you take her here. You probably will not regret it. \\n\\nAs for the interior, it had this contemporary 1930s/40s look, making it very modern and American. It also has the French cafe feel during the summer time and you could do some people watching. Service was pretty good, the servers were really nice and some of them were really pretty. \\n\\nOverall, this is a good place to splurge $10 on a cup of cocoa when it's cold outside. It's really good and probably worth it. It is also not a bad choice to splurge some money on a Cubano sandwich and a mushroom pizza."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stopped here today for lunch while attending columbus Arts Festival.

I like that they don't have a large menu and try to focus on a some specialty appetizers, a few sandwiches, some pasta dishes, and some entree' courses, but the food tends to be lack luster.  To state this more simply, in the past few years, I can't remember anything I've eaten here other than \\"desserts\\".  And even their desserts are hit or miss.  \\n\\nLast night I had a Sword fish sandwich, fries, and side salad.  My friend had the seafood pasta and added salmon.  His pasta was a bit overbearing.  The red sauce was very rich and they focused more on the seafood (to their benefit, it had a ton of muscles and shrimp) and had hardly any noodles.  My sword fish sandwich was okay. . . but ironically the salad tasted WAY better than the sandwich.  I kinda wish I just saved the calories and gotten a salad instead. \\n\\nI will give you a hint about their dessert case; if only 2 cakes are left, that means all of their good desserts have been devoured already.  I had to learn that the hard way.  \\n\\nOne good thing is their coffee.  Wow! I think Juan Valdez personally supplies their coffee beans from his own personal stash.  I hope you don't need sleep afterwards, because their coffee is strong (and delicious).\\n\\nOne redeeming factor about Apres Diem is their service.  Normally I have fantastic servers who are attentive and have great personalities.  I'm not sure what happened last night.  My server last night wasn't good.

My shake was completely melted and tasted like it had more sugar than any shake I've ever had. Right away I asked for a new shake and the employees looked at me like making a fresh shake was unheard of. I stood there and waited and noticed that the person making my shake tripped over the trashcan by the register.

Entrees are on average $9-10. Drinks are probably where they make most of their money.\\n\\nFood: The chips and salsa are the best I've ever had--both are made fresh, and the chips are often too hot to touch when they first bring it over. Chips are way beyond anything I've had at similar restaurants (The Fat Cactus). They are always very good about refilling your chips and salsa through the meal, and at the end will even pack it to go if you ask.The gulf coast seafood enchilada is my favorite, stuffed generously with crawfish and shrimp, and covered with a rich sauce. Next is the crawfish quesadilla, which is very large for the $8 price tag. The fajitas are pretty good, and the blackened catfish is another favorite. Burger is pretty standard, but very cheap--the stringy fries that come with it are great. I don't know if this is considered authentic Mexican fare, but it suits my palate very well.\\n\\nService is the best I've seen in Boston--most waiters are extremely eager and quick with service.

However, if I wanted to continue to stay, I'd be more than welcome to sit on a stool along the perimeter of the shop.   \\n\\nI can understand why and when a cafe might want to discourage patrons from hanging out too long but what really got me was that the cafe had THREE patrons inside. There were empty seats for at least another 15 people.  \\n\\nIs a one-hour stay considered excessive and did my length of stay in the sofa chair warrant a reprimand? There was no signage explaining this policy - it made me wonder if I was singled-out.  LOL.  There was at least one person in the cafe that had been there longer than me.  I guess because he chose the \\"stool seating\\" he was left alone. Who knew that this cafe had different classes of seating?!\\n\\nWhen I got ready to leave (naturally I had no interest in staying), NONE of those patrons had any interest in sitting in those chairs.

We went for happy hour (social hour) and decided not to stay for dinner because of our bad experience.\\n\\nTheir Social Hour wasn't very social with two-thirds of the items slightly discounted off the regular menu pricing, but even worse, the other third were at the same pricing as their regular, dinner menu.  I'm not used to having full priced items on a happy hour menu (marinated olives, toasted ciabatta bread, and grilled asparagus).  I will say the sauteed green beans ($5) were excellent and a nice portion size.  The Taylor Farms mussels were cooked perfectly, but the chile broth had some strange flavor combinations that didn't meld well ($7) and you get six mussels with some grilled ciabatta.  The potato croquettes were average at $1 each.  Not a great value.  There were three but we only ate two.\\n\\nAs for the drinks.  They are known for their home-brewed liquor and specialty drinks.  A good selection of wines by the glass.  On tap there are so many choices -- making it a wonderful place to taste a lot of options.  A couple of bottled beer choices if you want.  Social hour let us down here as well with only $1 off wines and well drinks.  They needed to offer a couple of choices on the 'daily social hour cocktail'.  Then we'd be rockin'.  As it ended up, our cocktails were $9 each.\\n\\nNow to the outside seating.  This has potential, but was a disaster when we were there.  Pretty close to the seating area is a large, black dumpster.  A staff member was by the dumpster smoking but quickly went inside when we were seated.  Then another staff went back and forth (from the kitchen?) carrying empty produce boxes past our table to the back of the restaurant.  Finally, the owner's wife (confirmed by our waiter) drove up to the back of the restaurant and proceeded to clean out and vacuum her car.  All of this was totally unacceptable for a dining guest to experience.  What they should do is put up a wall, install a nice water feature, and enclose this potentially nice outdoor dining area.

They also have a delectable looking bakery case full of delicious looking sweets everything from cookies to cheesecakes, pies to brownies were available. Most items were really big as well. I didn't have any of the baked items, but I will definitely indulge on my next visit. YEST THERE WILL BE A NEXT VISIT! We went about an hour before they closed and an employee told us that it was a great time because they are normally very busy throughout the morning.

Admittedly, the food is great - especially the bread basket (when we can get one); but last night pretty much sealed their fate for me. I live about a block away so the convenience is tempting but the service, well, just sucks and needs a complete rework.  Last night exemplified this. Upon entering the restaurant (no host/hostess greeted us), the entire dining room was empty (or, if any tables were occupied, the tenants were not visible).  My husband and I ventured over to the bar reluctantly (we swore we would never sit in the bar again last time we went) and took a hightop bar table as we've done many times previously. This is probably our 5th time experiencing the following: after sitting and waiting at our table and then staring down 2 servers chatting at the TV at the end of the somewhat full bar (and again, empty dining room), it again became apparent to us there must be some kind of delineation of server responsibility as only the bartender, who must be responsible for the bar area (including the bar tables) appeared to be working. He was serving patrons at the bar.  We sat at our table while aforementioned 2 servers, with absolutely nothing to do, did not provide us with water, a menu, any acknowledgement, etc.  Minutes passed with no server (and we reminisced how this happened to us many times before and we questioned why we had returned).  On prior occasions, when we finally were attended to, no bread ever showed up with our meal while tables around us at the bar received it (we've given up hope of receiving bread when dining in the bar area at this point)....  Anyway - the food is why we returned (which is delicious and exemplifies that someone in the kitchen truly knows what they're doing) but this time, we had enough. Another worker (maybe a manager or host) was finishing up a meal at the bar and when he was done eating (glad someone got a meal), he proceeded to join the 2 non-working servers still at the end of the bar as we continued to sit.  The bartender seemed to notice us but not enough to send anyone over even with menus...  So, after about 10 minutes, we walked out and got promptly seated and served at Barcelona.  Won't be back, this problem has persisted in this restaurant too long and they need to cross train servers in different sections of the restaurant to help one another when they're \\"slow\\" which could greatly increase if they don't get their act together."},{"name":"Lorenzo's Ristorante Italiano","address":"3807 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I live for fine food and I take my food very seriously.

I have made the food pilgrimage for both French Laundry and Per Se. \\n\\nI spent last week with my husband in Portland.  I had so many incredible meals there that by the end of the week, I was completely blown away by the culinary culture of Portland. Most of the meals I had in the Portland restaurants far surpassed the uber cuisine meccas I have eaten at in New York City.  \\n\\nOne of my last meals in Portland was eaten at Lorenzo's on Mississippi. We just happened upon it and the menu outside sounded delish. We started with a gorgeously simple, yet perfectly balanced, Antipasto della Casa flushed with a nice glass of Sangiovese.  I ordered the pasta special, the Giant Rustic Raviolo. It was not giant in size, but massive in taste. The sauce was bright, a thin sheet of pasta perfectly blanketed over a a gauze of prosciutto, a layer of bubbling fresh cheese and glimmering emerald broccolini. Healthy, warming, delicious and memorable.\\nI made my husband order the Basil Casarecci because it sounded so interesting; a homemade long and twisted noodle that folded into itself, embedded with fresh basil and bathed in an incredible spicy Italian sausage ragu with a touch of cream and spinach.

I'm a business owner and have multiple employees and it makes me sad that any of them would represent my business in this fashion! I really think some training is necessary to avoid this type of dispute. I'm all for ID'ing patrons but not discriminating or making up policy as you go.

Good \\n\\nMac & Cheese - the best mac n cheese I've bought to date (or at least tied with Mastro's).... super cheesey... the rue was thick and full of goodness.

I only ordered two sides:mashed potatoes- which are very good, and sauteed spinach-which is no bueno, and along with my lady's order I'm somehow already $40 in the hole.

The chopped scallop nigiri were delicious and we absolutely LOVED the deep fried smelt. We were thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and we will definitley be back soon in the future. Apparently the manager was on vacation and we enjoyed our dinner without hearing or seeing him literally running from one side of the restaurant to the other. It's so distracting and unprofessional... the wait staff last night were polite and quick. They definitley made our visit worthwhile and have gained us back as frequent customers. I can't wait to go back for those oysters!!\\n\\nWe also tried the specialty rolls the restaurant recently created and we were not a fan.

My friends and I went here after a big lunch together. I ordered an iced coffee with mocha, which wasn't anything more remarkable than what I can brew in my own kitchen. I tried to order the apple pie but they were all sold out by 1 pm. So I settled on a peanut butter something caramel something pie. It was a nice little size that I ended up sharing with friends because it was certainly rich and sweet. It was mostly whipped cream on top, but when I dug down into the pie and the crust, that part was very good. \\n\\nThe absolute biggest disappointment was the Faux-Oreos. Oreos are my favorite cookies and I thought it would be a different take on them. You get 2 pieces in an order... But I could barely take a bite out of one. The chocolate cookie was ROCK SOLID! It was beyond biscotti hard and it didn't even taste like chocolate. There are nice little metal tables for you to sit at outside; I slammed the cookies hard on the table and didn't even make crumbs. The cream inside was sparse. It looked clear, not white, like it is oil-based and not creamy. Definitely a faux-paus of a dessert.\\n\\nSeating in the bakery is cozy and limited. You are best taking your order to go. The staff all were very nice and it is clean and fun inside. I truly want to like Se7en Bites, but I can't see myself returning.

I felt pretty terrible about my plus one opening up a Wednesday evening, only to be disappointed in not being able to attend this event.\\n\\nPresented with these options:\\n\\na) Nervously stumble through words to my plus one, \\"Ummmm... heheheh... oh well, peace out!\\" *runs away* \\n\\nor\\n\\nb) Make the now-free evening worthwhile like the good friend that I accidentally try to be?\\n\\nI've really wanted to try this restaurant for the longest time. But Alden & Harlow, a place that doesn't really care for this website and its users?\\n\\nWhich brought up a few lines from that 80's movie The Rock wants to remake to his likely folly, \\"Big Trouble In Little China\\":\\n\\nJack Burton: Ah, you know what ol' Jack Burton always says at a time like this?\\nThunder: Who???\\nJack Burton: Jack Burton! Me!\\n[Chinese guy comes somersaulting in air, prepared to fight alongside Burton]\\nJack Burton: Ol' Jack always says, \\"What the hell?\\"\\n\\nWe started with chips and three-onion dip; something easy and basic. There was a strong onion flavor to the dip while the chips were fried nicely but unspectacular otherwise. \\n\\nThe pickled green bean complimentary starter was decent. There was enough bite to the green bean in terms of tartness and texture. \\n \\nWe had a tough time picking out a vegetable, but ended up with grilled spring onions with tahini and muscat grapes. The green part of the onion was charred while the bulb was soft. I guess the burnt flavor of the green contrasted with the sweetness of the bulb. The grapes were an interesting accompaniment, for when I think muscat grapes, I think of wine or Japanese gummy candy. The dish was inventive, to be sure. I don't think I'd go for it again, but props for its creativity. \\n\\nThe pork belly was something I wanted before coming in, and I'm glad it worked out. The pork was tender and flavorful, with a nice crispy skin. The grits were a good match, along with the...onions? Grapes? Apples? I thought the accompaniment would be apples but they became onions.\\n\\nAnother pre-determined selection was the smoked chocolate bread pudding. I definitely liked the smokiness of the bread pudding. The texture of the bread itself was warm and the noticeable chocolate flavor did not make the bread too cloy. The salt ice cream was perhaps...a little too salty. However, I did like its creaminess.\\n\\nThis is definitely an intimate establishment, one that can be characterized as a date spot. It's rather dark inside and my friend needed to ask for additional illumination. Though it was interesting to see a family with young children eating beside us. I seemed to have missed the kids-sized portion of carpaccio on the menu. :-P \\n\\nService was excellent, as the main server was attentive, patient, and congenial. He was descriptive with his details of the menu choices. Everyone else was quick to clear plates and refill water. \\n\\nConsidering the reports from that Yelp event that I missed out, I apparently dodged a bullet, Neo-style.

We had a reservation for 4 at 10:30am and after seeing their menu online, we were very excited to try this place.  Unfortunately, it was just one disappointment after another...the main reason: the TERRIBLE service from Michael (I only know his name because it was on our bill...not because he introduced himself to us, which we heard another friendlier server do at another table).\\n\\nWhen we arrived promptly at 10:30am, we were immediately seated.  There was only one other party in the restaurant at the time and we were seated at a great booth by a window.  This is where it turned sour.  Michael finally came over and took our drink order.  4 drinks.  Shouldn't be hard to remember, right?  When he brought our drinks about 10 minutes later, he had forgotten mine.  It was fine - it can easily happen.  Whatever.  I was ready to forgive him.  However when I got my bloody mary, it was so incredibly messy.  The glass had more soggy spice on the outside than it probably did inside.  It was filled to the brim so that it created a huge puddle on the table as he set it down.  It was not very good and I had a very hard time drinking it.  More chipotle and spice than I  prefer...I did not enjoy it (and I really do usually enjoy some zip in a bloody mary; this one just wasn't cutting it).  \\n\\nIt then took Michael 20 minutes to come back and take our order.  WHAT?!  Then when the food came it took another 8 minutes to flag him down just to ask for some ketchup and hot sauce.  He said sure and walked off.  5 minutes later I saw him standing by the window, just staring out into space.  WHAT?!  I had to flag down the friendlier server from the table next door and ask him for the condiments.  Michael came back another 5 minutes later with the ketchup and Cholula.  Of course, by that time, I had already eaten my potatoes.  Ugh.\\n\\nAs for the food...meh.  One of my friends and I split the Mexican omelet and the huevos rancheros.  The Mexican omelet was really mediocre at best.  There was nothing Mexican about it.  Do they think putting a sort of diced tomato wanna-be salsa on top makes it so?  Nice try.  The huevos rancheros were better - but again, nothing special.  I guess the beans were pretty good?  Ugh.  Another friend had the breakfast burrito that boasted chorizo in the contents.  Not much chorizo was found inside.  It was mostly just scrambled eggs.  The one thing I can say I really did enjoy is the poppy seed bread that came before the meal.  It came with 3 different spreads - a cinnamon butter, a chipotle jam and an orange jam.  The cinnamon butter and chipotle jam were pretty darn good.  They kinda melted in your mouth.\\n\\nBack to Michael, the awful server.  He managed to be nonchalant and full of attitude at the same time.  You could tell he just did not care.  As you can probablly guess, it took forever to get the bill.  Luckily we weren't really in any hurry.  I have never had service this bad.  It was really shocking to me how unattentive he was.  It was like pulling teeth, trying to get him to help us.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is actually kinda cute though.  Has a nice ambiance and was packed by the time we left.  People obviously like this place, especially since there are over 300 reviews on here for it.  I'm guessing  though that the people that like it have not been served by Michael.  It doesn't matter how nice a place looks and feels.  If you have service this bad and mediocre food to go along, the place gets a single star in my book."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"There is a reason people wait hours and hours to get food here.

But let me tell you it was well worth the wait! It was honestly the best ribs I have ever had. NO SAUCE NEEDED! The meat fell off the bone as soon as I touched it! The brisket was also very good. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is first the sauce selection was not good. (Wanted some for my brisket) Second the sides were not up to par to be paired with the delicious selection of meat. I had the potato salad (way too much mustard and not enough seasoning) I also had the ranch beans and they were gross. I wish they would have had baked beans!

The potatoes were nicely cooked. The duck wasn't my favorite thing in the world.  According to the menu it was smoked.  Maybe I prefer a more confit style of preparation where the fat was a little more reduced and the skin was crispier...  Parts of it were cooked perfectly though, and there was a nice crispyness... while other parts were terrible.  Overall it all could've used a good sear and maybe could've cooked a little longer overall.  It seemed like it was just kind of baked and nothing else.  I didn't specify how I wanted it cooked, I usually would respond however the chef thinks it's best.  It was somewhere between rare and medium rare, which I think would turn a lot of diners off unless executed perfectly.  3/5s of it was quite nice.  The 2/5 is the problem... it was a gelatinous fat that I chewed for about 2-3 minutes before just swallowing while hoping I didn't throw up...  luckily I didn't need to eat the whole thing anyway so it wasn't a huge deal (though that 3 minutes was very trying), and at the same time I had to deal with picking through the parts that seemed really nasty.\\n\\nI guess the moral of the story is to listen to yelpers, who seem to think the fried chicken is really great... The duck was what the waiter recommended.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the bread pudding... It was good.  I should've stopped at the entree though, I felt pretty nasty after.

I ordered a Bloody Maria, I assume the Spanish version of a Bloody Mary, and boy was I disappointed. Not only did it only have two olives and an onion as a garnish but every time I took a sip I thought I was being punched in the gut by horseradish. I only managed to drink 1/4 of it.

Cool in theory, but our seat was only lit by a tiny tea candle, so we had to pull out our phones to be able to read the menu, and we weren't really able to see our food when it came- next time I'd probably try and dine in one of the other rooms that are more well-lit (but the lounge is perfect for drinks with friends or a hot date). Our waitress was attentive and professional though, and they did ask us how we were finding our seat (they had just moved a table to that particular spot and were curious as to how we were finding it- it was a lovely cozy private spot, but just a little too dark).\\n\\nAfter a tasty bourbon cocktail, 2 of us split the following (and ended up being stuffed):\\n\\nPork cheek: excellent dish, from top to bottom, and felt like a mini-entree (well-composed). Meat was tender and flavorful, carrot puree was a great counterpoint, and the huckleberries added a nice pop.\\n\\nFried chicken thighs with white BBQ sauce: executed very well, although I wish there were more sauce (it was applied very sparingly IMO).\\n\\nBoiled peanut hummus with andouille: unique dish that was part peanut butter and part hummus, it was seasoned very well and ended up being pretty hearty with the crumbled sausage on top.\\n\\nBiscuits: decent for what they are (nice crunchy top, good flavor), but too heavy/thick for me personally. It's really hard to beat the biscuits at Sweet Cheeks, and unfortunately these just don't compare. However, I could have eaten the accompanying pimento cheese on anything, it was really tasty...\\n\\nShandy-braised peal-and-eat cocktail shrimp: utterly ginormous, good flavor from the shandy, excellent accompanying sauces (the white sauce especially- I think it was a tobasco creme fresh or something).\\n\\nThese are all small plates which means a resulting big bill, but each plate does come with a lot of food, and the food quality & uniqueness helps make the prices worth it (plus if you order smartly, you could in theory keep your check low)."},{"name":"Club 185","address":"185 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"If you go to Club 185, you gotta get the Club 185 Burger (duh)!

We were meeting a group there, so we got to the bar early and had to try the Stockyard Smoker, mainly so I could watch them make it.  It was VERY good, and the prep was so fun to watch.  I'm an Old Fashoined and Manhattan lover, so this was right up my alley. \\n\\nThere were nine of us, so we did a lot of appetizer plates at first.  Our first round was to try the fettine.  We opted for the trio to try everything.  The duck/rabbit-rattlesnake sausage was my favorite.  The fettine was an experience, but I've done it...if I go back, I will pass.  \\n\\nOn to the small plate appetizers...we tried the following:\\n \\nRabbit-Rattlesnake Sausage (good, mild game flavor in a good way. They were served on skewers on top of a rosti, aka fancy tater tot.)\\n\\nWild Boar Ribs (by far my absolute favorite.  So tender and full of flavor, and the sauce was amazing.  They had the perfect amount of char/crunch. If I ever go back, this is probably the only app we will get.)\\n\\nDeviled Gulf Coast Blue Crabs (Meh. Lots of breading.)\\n\\nElk-Foie Gras Sliders (I love foie gras...so I radiate to anything with it.  These were a huge disappointment.  I understand elk is dry by nature, but these were really dry.  And the foie gras?  There was a tinnnny sliver on top that I had to find by turning on my phone's flashlight. Yes.  I was that old person flashligting in a dark restaurant.)\\n\\nWood Fired Gulf Coast Oysters (Spectacular...the natural brine mixed with the light sauce was yummy!)\\n\\nBlue Corn-Lobster Hushpuppies (Okay.  Again, lobster kind of got lost in the breading.  Very good flavor, but if I get lobster, I want lobster. People at our table loved them, just not for me.)\\n \\nMy boyfriend and I split an escarole salad.  The thing that lured me to it?   The anchovy lime vinaigrette.  I LOVE anchovies.  I got zero anchovy taste from the salad. I did love the polenta croutons, but that was about it.\\n \\nFor the main course, I was teeter-tottering between the black garlic crusted wagyu skirt steak and the quail.  The quail won out because of the fois gras stuffing. I wish I had gone with the wagyu.  The quail itself was wonderful and well prepared, but the stuffing was fois gras free to my taste buds.  I was a cornbread type dressing, and while it tasted great, I should have done the beef (missed pic of quail). My boyfriend got the buffalo steak which was out of this world.  Cooked medium rare, and it was not the least bit dry.\\n \\nFor sides we got the burnt carrots after seeing they were  \\"the rave\\" on yelp.  They were...interesting.  Very unique flavor combos and don't get me wrong, they were good, but a once and done experience for me . The  crispy Brussel sprouts were, however, out of this world!\\n \\nFinal verdict...it was a nice evening and  good meal.

He too went to undergrad and grad school in Cambridge, so a quick lunch at Border Cafe was high on his list in order to satisfy his long-standing Mexican food craving.\\n\\nBorder Cafe is always busy, no matter what time of day.  We arrived around 12:30 and it was crowded, but we managed to sneak in and grab a table without a wait.  I perused the menu, unsure of exactly what my options were for a good lunch salad.  I was happy to see that the menu had its own vegetarian section!\\n\\nOur waiter was fantastic!  As soon as we sat down, a large basket of warm tortilla chips and house-made salsa were placed in front of us.  I passed on the chips and salsa this time, since it was a bit early in my day to stuff my face with them, but my husband had no hesitation in diving in!\\n\\nAs he did that, I admired the condiments.  I was tickled by the Crystal hot sauce- I have never seen that brand before!\\n\\nI also took a glance around to appreciate the festive and eclectic decorations!\\n\\nI decided to take a vegetarian salad off the menu and tweak it a bit so it would be just right for me.  Another reason I hearted our waiter was when I told him my order was a bit complicated, he told me not to worry a bit.  After I delivered my order, he told me that was easy!  I love when waitstaff are so open to accommodating fussy guests!\\n\\nI ordered their vegetarian black bean salad without the flour shell it typically comes in, without cheese, without mushrooms, and without dressing.  I asked for an extra side of salsa to use as dressing instead.  With all of those alterations, I ended up with exactly what I wanted:  black beans, salsa, guacamole, tomatoes, lettuce, red onion, and green peppers.  Vegan, gluten-free, and delicious!\\n\\nSince their salsa is amazing, and their guac is equally stellar, this salad was packed with spicy Mexican flavor.  My husband did not believe me when I said salsa was a bomb salad topper, so I offered him a bite to test it out.  He was, to say the least, blown away!  He finally caved in and expressed to me how it clicked for him with that bite- he now \\"gets\\" why I use salsa as salad dressing, especially along with avocado.  As I have always said, he too admitted it tasted like the inside of his beloved Chipotle burrito.\\n\\nBorder Cafe was wonderful about crafting a meal for menu that I was happy with.

This truly is one review I'm not sure how to even start, so I'll tell the whole tale.\\n\\nSmall Fry's birthday was coming up on me quickly, and being a lame parental unit, hadn't really thought of a really cool/fun activity to do for her special day.  Groupon however, mind read my predicament and offered severely discounted tickets for this Pirate Dinner Show.  I snapped up 3 of these bad boys, felt smug and only then (crap-crap-crap) checked Yelp.  \\n\\nPull into the parking lot only to find out that parking is now a whopping $5.00.  This does not include someone valeting your car or washing it or a quick vacuum... nothing.  However, because we inquired about said services the parking money taker gave us a discount card for the gift shop inside.\\n\\nWe walk through the parking lot and towards the entrance of the building.  It's themed and decorated with piratey stuff and Small Fry was having fun pointing all the stuff out to us.   At the actual will call/ticket booths, I gave them my name and our dining preference of chicken, beef or vegetarian.  Please note, you may also \\"upgrade\\" to a chicken breast, filet mignon, salmon and a surf and turf option for various up charges.  For the love of your wallet, don't do it.\\n\\nWalk into the building and they immediately try to stage you for your pirate portrait.  We declined.\\n\\nThen you walk into a large holding area, that has 2 cash bars and a gift shop.  We arrived just prior to showtime, so we missed the pre-show and got to walk right into the theatre area.\\n\\nTheatre is set up with a large ship like stage area in the middle with 2 half moon seating areas around. Find your seating area, denoted by color and written on your ticket, and find some seats.   Showtime is at 7:30, however that really when they start serving dinner, as the actual show didn't start until after 8. \\n\\nFirst Course: Iceberg lettuce salad with your choice of Italian or ranch dressing. The server squirts it on for you...\\n\\nMain entree- 1/4 chicken is seasoned and baked.  It was fairly tasty and wasn't dry.   Beef was a fairly tender chunk of beef, also baked, and came out medium.  All were served with green beans, seasoned carrots and a kind of potato o'gratin dish.    Not horrible, but more of a cafeteria type offering, rather than fine dining.\\n\\nDrinks are unlimited, Sprite or Coke/Diet Coke or Beer.  The soft drinks are horrible; no fizz and the syrup to soda water ratio is totally off.  Good luck trying to get your server to refill.\\n\\nSo as you're trying to eat your main entree, the lights dim and the show starts...  \\nShow synopsis: Pirates, loud singing, muffled dialog, and convoluted story line.  We might have missed the setup by not attending the pre-show, but I really don't think much can help this show.   There were some cool acrobatic stunts interspersed throughout.  The highlight of the show is when they bring up all the kids onto the boat/stage and swear them in as pirates.  Seeing Small Fry's joy at being a \\"real\\" pirate, was worth sitting through the show.\\n\\nAs the show is wrapping up, dessert is served.  A plop of \\"apple pie\\" drizzled with a non-Hershey brand chocolate sauce.  It was gross enough that even Small Fry had one bite and pushed it away.  \\n\\nThe server then helpfully places a tray in front of you, with a suggested gratuity of $5 per adult and $3 per child.\\n\\nThe show ends, YAY, and you funnel out into the holding area for the pirate dance party.  The DJ was playing some fun family dance music, and some of the characters are available to take pictures with.  The bars are open again at this time.\\n\\nSmall Fry milled around the gift shop for a bit.  Most of the offerings are junky Oriental Trading Company schlock at highly inflated prices.  The only thing I saw that I actually wanted were skull and crossbones bandaids, but at 7 bucks for a small tin, I passed.   In closed cases there were replica swords and armor pieces.  One odd offering was a US Marine dress sword.  \\n\\nTo close, Small Fry loved the show.  The adults did not.  No one liked the dinner. We all went home and ate a snack.\\n\\nDo not pay full price for tickets.  Do not pay to just see the show.  This is a tired dinner theatre that needs a major overhaul.\\n\\nNOTE: If someone in your party is noise sensitive, please bring earplugs/noise dampener device, or be prepared to hold your little one's ears during the scenes where they're shooting at each other."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm late in writing this review.

Franklin usually has about 3 hours wait each day.  A lot of people asked if it's that good and worth the wait.  personally, I think their brisket is noticeably much better than all the other BBQ places I have tried.  I would strongly recommend BBQ lovers to try out this place.  I have had brisket, sausage, ribs and turkey from Franklin.  Brisket is my favorite.  It comes with lean or fat.  The fat brisket is very tender and juicy, so delicious.  The lean brisket is surprisingly tender and delicious as well.  Besides brisket, my second favorite is their rib.

Service was great and the prices are reasonable.

We went around 11:30am so it was not busy at all. Our lunch started with the waitress bringing us what we thought was salsa and chips. Turns out the kitchen staff gave her shrimp marinara sauce. Once they realized the mistake the waitress came and changed it to the correct sauce, which was very pasty and bland to say the least. My husband and I both agreed the marinara sauce was much better.\\n\\nI ordered the new Red River Salad which consists of Mesquite grilled chicken, fresh avocado, pickled red onion, tomato and ruby red grapefruit and their homemade Honey-Lime dressing. The tomatoes were a little green, chicken was over cooked and the grapefruit overpowered the Honey-Lime dressing, which was a little to sweet but very tasteful. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the Cinco Combo which brings a beef taco, a soft chicken taco plus three enchiladas. The soft taco did not even compare to Taco Bell! There was no flavor at all. The beef tasted like if they cooked it and then rinsed out all the flavor to it. VERY bland. Seriously a little cilantro would have improved it drastically. As for the enchiladas. I dared not try them, but my husband says they were just as bad if not worse and didn't even finish them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I gave it a 2 star.

It has a similar atmosphere / menu / crowd as BarChi and Maiko, though overall I think it beats both those restaurants in terms of food quality.  This is not the place to go to get the highest-quality, best sushi in town (that's probably Uchi) but if you want to go to a party-oriented sushi spot with a big group this would probably be my top recommendation.  Unlike BarChi and Maiko, it has quite a bit of space inside and so isn't as packed with a long-wait.  The bar area is also significantly bigger, is on the second floor (above Capital Grille) so it has a good view of part of the Austin skyline, and offers some significant outdoor seating.\\n\\nThe 3 stars is because, much like BarChi and Maiko, this place absolutely NEVER seems to have enough people working.  My server has, without fail, always shown serious delays in getting our initial orders, responding to requests, and getting food delivered efficiently.  The servers themselves have always been very nice and attentive; it is not that they are \\"bad\\" waiters and waitresses, but more that they are clearly overwhelmed with the crowd. I'm not sure why this is a pattern with all three \\"party\\" sushi spots, but I am assuming this may be part of the cause of the long wait times for a table.\\n\\nAlso, as mentioned above, the sushi is decent, but not the best I've had for the price, and probably only average compared to all the sushi restaurants I've ever been to.

I've heard such great things about it, but I guess this included a lot of hype. Boy and his brother went here a while ago and returned nonplussed, so since then I haven't rushed to go, but today, we thought we'd have some summer food since it was so, so nice out. \\n\\nEven the interior of Dirty Franks doesn't really impress me. I guess after you've had Hot Doug's (Chicago), and Hillbilly Hotdogs (Huntington, WV), NOTHING will ever live up. Although, I do feel like, with the yellow interior and red trim, Dirty Franks is kinda stealing from Hot Doug's. Anyway... I did enjoy the local art of pop/rock celebrities and the apparently all-local jukebox. Nice touch. \\n\\nThe hot dogs were lacking, to be honest. While nothing beats a Fenway frank or a Hillbilly hotdog, or even a gourmet sausage from Hot Doug's (even while I lived in Chicago for two and a half years and never tried a Chicago dog), I still knew Dirty Franks was just okay. I had the Chicago dog and the (I forget the name) cream cheese and green olive dog at Dirty Franks and ze boy had two Chicago Dogs. Honestly... mehhh... they were good but didn't blow me away. The Chicago dog was better than the olive one. I feel like there is room for WAY more creativity here, as well as better hot dogs (since they're the main ingredient and all). Whatever happened to big, juicy dogs? Or even crispy, snappy dogs? Dirty Franks has neither. They're kinda nondescript. \\n\\nI did enjoy our fry-al-lated tater tots (and our ensuing discussion of the word \\"tater\\"), as well as the fountain root beer... but I wouldn't recommend Dirty Franks, unless you've never been and just want to experience it for yourself.

The Pork (which usually comes sliced or even chopped at the multitude of other ramen places I have been to) came as chunky GROUND Pork! I was really surprised and the texture and grey color was unappetizing to say the least. The Brussel Sprouts were oily and extremely sweet. Also, the price for the Katsu appetizer sandwich, that was no bigger than the tiny Chik fil a biscuit sandwich ( which there you get at least 3 for less than 5$) for 4 dollars.

I never stood in line because I don't think it's ever worth standing more than 15 minutes in line just to get food, and that's already pushing it. \\n\\nThe food is decent enough but portion sizes are pretty small, considering the steep price you pay. It's not going to break any banks, but for a tiny place that serves ramen with small amounts of meat(ie. one slice), half an egg, and some woodear mushrooms, I didn't expect to pay $10. Yeah the food isn't bad at all but if you look at what's on your plate it looks like something you could make at home for a quarter the price you pay. Yeah the broth was nice and rich, I wouldn't deny that. However, take a look at your plate and if you ever cook food at home you'll know that the only logical explanation for the steep prices is that something in your bowl must be flown in from Tokyo every morning. It's definitely not the ramen, or the meat, or the mushrooms, or the egg. I'd like to believe somewhere out there in Japan an elderly chef dedicates his life to cooking the broth used in this restaurant, and every morning drives to the airport with a fresh batch to ship to Ramen Tatsu-Ya. I don't believe it unfortunately, and that's just the ramen. I mean come on, $4 for a curry rice bowl containing only potatoes, carrots, and onions? 50 cents just to have \\"self-pressed\\" garlic?\\n\\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by Mexican joints, and you know what? $10 isn't too bad for a hearty meal. Except I went home and had my second dinner half an hour after I finished dinner here. It just wasn't filling.\\n\\nService is also pretty lacking considering how popular this place is. They serve lukewarm water in tiny cups that probably hold about 6oz of water, and there's no self serve so if you're thirsty and the waiter is nowhere to be found then tough luck, stay thirsty. And guess what? Even at peak hours when there's 20 people waiting outside and 50 people packed in the tiny restaurant, there's still only 3 waiters going around. This place looks like a fast food joint, you order like in a fast food joint, except it's not a fast food joint. If you need something, you try to get a waiter's attention but he's busy mixing up meals at another table because the fact that everything is in Romanized Japanese means no one knows what they ordered. Oh and that other table is actually also your table, because you're sitting on a table meant to accommodate 12 people but no one ever comes in in a group that big so there's a good chance that there's a stranger next to you or across from you, and you're pretending to not notice him because you each have your own group of friends to talk to even though you're just a foot away from him.\\n\\nThese guys could use an overhaul of their whole system."},{"name":"Mario's Restaurant","address":"347 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"An absolute gem in East Boston.

We waited forty minutes for our first dish and an additional half hour for our next three dishes even though staff and the manager insisted our food would be out in two minutes.\\n\\nThe scallion pancake came out first, which was good.  The pancake was very crispy, though there could have been more scallion flavor.  Next came our seamed pork buns, which were very good.  Finally, they brought us our shu mai and steamed spare ribs, which were the worst things we had during the meal. We ordered pork shu mai, but they brought us shrimp shu mai, which had a very slimy texture and little flavor.  The spare ribs were the most disappointing at all.  Spare ribs should fall off the bone, but what we got looked like the leftovers from the ribs.  We ended up with little piece of bone no meat on them, our pieces were completely bone and fat.

At the very least, the restaurant should have done something to compensate us.

It was poor customer service to  lie, make us wait over an hou r for our food, threaten to call the police on us, and refuse to even work with us or take the time to listen to our complains.  \\n\\nEven if the service was better, the food itself was not worth the trip.

Has is really come down to this?? Is it really worth it? Are people really that crazy? Well the answer is yes. \\n I have prided myself on Texas BBQ, I have been smoking my own briskets for 15 years and have tasted almost all Texas BBQ possible, but Franklins has blown me away. The brisket is the best I have ever had, Lockhart doesn't have nothing on him, and thats all of them, Kreuz, Smittys, and Blacks. Pork ribs, same thing, just like another review said, \\"slap yo momma.\\" Turkey, juicy and tender, love it. Now for my dislikes, sausage could be better, it was not bad, love the snap of the casing, just some seasoning or something. And the sides need some work, beans are spicy and just a bit overwhelming. You don't have to add brisket to beans, because your brisket is that good, try again. Potato salad, lacked spices, pimento, and pickle relish. But I am crazy about potato salad. The cole slaw is perfect. Now everyone has different taste buds and pallets, so who give a sh*t about sides, the BBQ is fantastic. I was in a BBQ coma for about three hours because I could not stop eating that brisket, Aaron you are a BBQ god, I bow down like Wayne's World, \\" I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy.\\" And I applaud your effort to keep the crazies from cutting the line.

We seated ourselves, as the sign says to do, than after waiting a bit a guy came over and threw two menus on our table without saying anything and then just completely turned his back and went to do something else. Eventually when he came back he didn't say hello, or ask how we were tonight, just asked if we were ready to order. No refills on either of our drinks either. I was so confused. We both felt extremely uncomfortable and tried to order/eat as fast as we could so we could get out of there as soon as possible. The server never talked to us, just asked if we were ready to order. As much as I love that place I never plan to go back because of that experience. When my friend and I left we both looked at each other with confusing asking what we could've done to make this guy treat us so poorly. He obviously shouldn't be a server if he has no people skills.

It has cucumber salad, soy sauce, and a BIG side of wasabi that was so fresh it cleared my sinuses immediately.  There were six good sized pieces of ahi.  Somebody previously mentioned the disasppointment that it was room temperature.  It has to be room temperature to sear, and the point of searing isn't to cook it through and make it warm all over.  Nobody likes refrigerator cold ahi with a thin dry cooked crust, which is what happens when it isn't warmed to room temp first.  I thought it was very good.  \\n\\nI sampled the rock fish with crab dressing, very yummy.  The sole was full of bones, and the waiter warned my friend of that, but it was worth it, as the fish was so moist and tender and good.

I don't know where the other reviewers are dining but it's certainly not where I ate last night.  My bf and I ordered take out, our second time doing so.  The first time we ordered fajitas.  The steak was dry, overcooked and we were not given the sides the food was said to come with (salsa, guac, sour cream) but the place had just opened so we decided to try it again a few weeks down the road.  Last night was a HUGE mistake.  We both ordered (via phone) the baja tacos and some wings.  We ordered a side of sour cream.  My boyfriend repeated the order in detail twice and the distracted spacey girl on the phone told  us it would be 15-20 min.  30 minutes later my bf gets down there and any sign of us having placed an order is non existent.  I know this can occasionally happen but there were 8 (literally) other people in the restaurant.  I don't understand what the order girl was so busy doing that she lost our order.  This should have been our first sign that this place is dying.  It used to be packed when we would drive by (or the one time we popped in) on a saturday night.  Think the fine folks of Winchester are starting to realize they're better off at Border Cafe.  Or Taco Bell.....  Regardless, bf was told it would be about 10 min, the order would be put in right away.  30 min later (and a full hour after we initially called) he was given our food.  He specifically stated \\"Is there sour cream in here?\\" He was told \\"yes\\".  Sour cream and mexican go hand in hand.  He also asked if they were willing to comp ANYTHING for the hour long wait. He was told no, and then told he could get $3.75 off.  Seriously?  You have NO customers.  You might want to have a LITTLE bit of decency with the few that are willing to walk into your hell hole.  He returned home (we live about 2 miles away) and the chicken on the tacos is ice cold.  No exaggeration whatsoever.  The tacos came with just a handful of raw onions, half melted cheese and an \\"avocado cream sauce\\".  Avoid this at all costs, trust me.  It tasted like I had just sucked on a lime.  No avocado flavor at all.  Just creamy...lime.  yuck.  And after asking for sour cream 5 times and receiving confirmation that yes, it would be in there, it was nowhere to be found.  The wings were all loose, limp, chewy skin, not a hint of a crisp to it and the quality of the chicken wing used was slimy, sinewy and basically a mouth full of fat.  Beans and rice - came right out of a box and can I could have bought for 2 for $1.00 up the street.  \\n\\nAll in all I'm VERY disappointed with this place.  Mostly for the lack of customer service.  I'm always willing to give a place a couple of chances on their food but the people that run this place are so ill equipped to do so.  They treat their customers like they don't need them, which from the looks of it last night is highly inaccurate.  We barely got a sorry and wasn't even allowed to speak to a manager or offered ANYTHING as retribution for waiting an hour for cold, tasteless food.  I've worked in a couple of restaurants in my life and we always always made it right to the customer if there was a screw up on our end.  That's just common sense when you own/work in a restaurant.  I've been urging my sister and brother in law to go here and we had plans to soon but unfortunately this is a trip I think we will never take.  The manager/owner needs to make some serious changes and amends to his customers if he wants to survive in this town.  Very unfortunate.  This will be my last rodeo.\\n***********************************************************************\\nI sent an email (this review) to the staff at Rodeo Mexican Grille (they have a link on their website) and they did respond very courteously and promptly.  They apologized for our inconvenience that night and were very genuine about it.  They offered us a make-up meal if we chose to come back at any time.

By AYCE standards, the sushi is freshly made and delicious. The dinner price is a little on the higher side ($22 or $25 depending on which menu) but is justified by the wide selection of various dishes. Lunch is a great deal at $11 on weekdays.\\n\\nFood: While most AYCE places features quantity over quality, Ninkazu's quality is actually pretty good. Fish is fresh, fried food is still hot when it reaches your table, and the rice to protein ratio is actually reasonable. There's even rainbow Jello on the menu which is oddly fun to order.\\n\\nAmbience: The restaurant is nicely decorated with one wall made up of floor to ceiling windows. It's quite a large space and feels even bigger w/ the windows. My only complaint is the bigger round booths in the back aren't cushioned - just hard wooden benches.\\n\\nLocation: Ninkazu is on the second floor of a busy strip mall across Aberdeen center. The entrance is not immediately apparent but you can clearly see the restaurant on the second floor. The parking situation here is atrocious. There's a small lot of about 25 spots - half of which are 15 minute parking. There's also more parking in the back but they're all reserved for other businesses. The other option is pay parking across the street (just outside Aberdeen mall) or just to park in the mall itself.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Solid choice for AYCE sushi - certainly one of the better ones in town. Its sister restaurant, Tomokazu on Broadway, is equally as good."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I got the BC plate which is plenty of food for one person especially because it comes with two sides. I would recommend the mac and cheese, green beans, fried okra, tater tots (but you can get this anywhere), and collard greens.

These are questions a friend and I set out to answer.  The first thing we discovered was that you sure better get there early.  They posted their sold out sign about 2 minutes after our part of the line moved inside.  Though at the end of the day, we only waited about 20 minutes.\\n\\nMr. Franklin is very friendly, chatting up his customers as he serves them a heavy plate of meat.  Toward the end of the line, he was running out of fatty brisket, but anyone willing to settle (ha!) for lean was rewarded with an extra-generous portion.\\n\\nBefore I continue, I should mention that though I spent most of my youth in Texas, I don't have much in the way of an accent.  I don't really have a whole lot of \\"Texan\\" characteristics in general.  But the one thing (OK, TWO things, but this isn't the time to talk about chicken fried steak) growing up in Texas imprinted on me was that barbecue means beef.  So while Franklin already has an advantage in that they seem to focus on beef (and sausage), he also faces some pretty stiff competition from other pretty amazing smoked beef palaces.\\n\\nSo how does it stand up?  Let's not kid ourselves, he can cook a piece of meat.  The brisket was flavorful, full of smoky succulence but still retaining a strong beefy flavor.  It was moist, even the lean pieces, and absolutely delicious all by itself.  It also stood up to the trio of barbecue sauces available (though I do not recommend the espresso one, which has a really strident bitterness).  \\n\\nThe sausage was everything a sausage should be.  It was coarsely ground, so you knew you were really biting into a fresh sausage, dripping with fat and smoke and salt.  It was spicy but not harsh.  And it was tender, which is really an accomplishment for a barbecued sausage.\\n\\nI've had better brisket and sausage both.  Snow's Barbecue in the middle of BFE is pretty much the holy grail of brisket for me.  But this came pretty damned close, and in terms of convenience, waiting for 20 minutes (or two hours) in line sure as hell beats driving out to the middle of nowhere at 8 on a Saturday morning.\\n\\nAs an aside, any leftover brisket you may have (my friend, not me!) makes some pretty overwhelmingly great hash the next morning."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I chose the Slappy Pappy. \\n\\nMy food was decent, the wait and the staff.. not so much."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We had Lunch, it was flavorful, sampled the fish and chips- great tarter sauce and yes good fish; traditional eggs bene, and crabcake bene.

This place hasn't changed but I did--I ate at a bunch of other BBQ places in Atlanta many, many times since I wrote the original review.  I have a much deeper cache of references now and, judging comparatively, don't think Fat Matt's is \\"great\\" anymore.  It is just decent.  \\n\\nThe best thing is the rack of ribs, done in a greasy and fairly saucy style, and more cartilaginous than most.  Rather sweet, moist, and tender.  It's pretty good stuff.  Unfortunately, sides, pulled pork, and chicken are mediocre.  The options are limited with only basic items that are of a quality not really distinguishable from what you would find at a \\"country kitchen buffet\\".  Plus, the bread is like Wonder Bread.  No interesting house sauces.  \\n\\nI think this place has been riding on old reputation for a while now.  Places like Fox Bros, Rolling Bones, and especially relatively new Community Q and Heirloom Market--both superb--generally pushed Atlanta's BBQ scene to a higher level and continue to get better.  Maybe Fat Matt's will continue to be a newcomer's first taste of Atlanta BBQ, because of its long-standing fame, and it's going to impress people with less exposure to great BBQ.  So it's going to continue getting good reviews that way.

On Saturdays, Cypress Street keeps the kitchen going until 2:15. We were carded upon entering, realizing instantly that it was more a bar than restaurant. The patio looked like a fun place to share beers and food with friends. Plenty of tvs , both inside and out, showing sports. Inside, the music was crazy loud. We settled into a small booth and had a waitress appear with waters and menus instantly. We started with the BBQ Egg Rolls, filled with pulled pork and collard greens, deep fried, and served with sriracha ranch. Definitely a unique taste, but heavy! I don't know if it was the grease of the bbq or the butter of the collards, but those little suckers were rich. Not to say I wouldn't want to get them again, but definitely a food I would probably eat in a bar and down with a beer. The hubs and I split a buffalo chicken sandwich. Great bun and good sauce. The chicken breast was a bit thin, so the buffalo flavor was a bit overpowered by the blue cheese. The beer selection available was good. However, considering the Pint and Plate name, we were expecting a bigger tap list.

The pre-opening line was huge.  By the time it was our turn to be seated, our choices were to wait approximately an hour for a table, or sit at the bar.

Every host and server we talked to was friendly and well informed, not stand-offish or snooty in the least.\\n\\nMy friend and I debated on appetizers, and settled on Hush Puppies.  They were very good, but slightly dry.  I used the sauce, but after a few pups slathered in it, I lost the taste for more.\\n\\nI ordered the Screen Door Plate, my picks were the fried pork-chop, catfish, and mac & cheese.  If you order one thing at the Screen Door, order the mac & cheese, it is just pure sin baked into a ceramic bowl.  The catfish came with a mustard dipping sauce that was great and the pork chop was alright with it's accompanying gravy.  The only problem with this meal was the sheer quantity of food.  I ate about a third of each of my items before becoming so full I had to box the rest.\\n\\nSeated to my left, my friend thoroughly enjoyed his brisket, which he said was fantastic, but a little spicy because of the sauce.  He had requested mashed potatoes instead of the potato salad, and was very happy with the switch.  In addition to his meal, he ordered a side of Texas toast, which looked fine, but only had half of eaten.

Bono Pizza was my treat to 4 strong guys who helped me move my furniture this weekend. Free Pizza and beer, how can you turn that down?\\n\\nI picked out Bono Pizza after hearing about them on Columbus Underground (as BonoToGo) years ago. Each pizza sounded unique, interesting and tasty. Flash forward two years into the future and Bono Pizza has a new home in the back of a package store.\\n\\nI don't know what Bill C. is talking about - I loved the atmosphere and the tiny dining room! Straight out of a quaint European kitchen with lace and framed photographs on the wall, Bono Pizza felt inviting. Due to the heat and full outdoor patio we opted to eat at the bar, which presented us with the perfect opportunity to chat with the owners. I've never felt so welcomed into an establishment. Conversation flowed easily helped along by the beer purchased inside of the carryout. This must be one of the few BYOB places in Columbus, and I love that the B part of that statement is located in the same building. Place your order and then walk around the carryout to find your perfect beer or wine. Bono Pizza will even provide the glasses for you.\\n\\nOkay, so I already love the atmosphere and the owners - what about the food? Each 10\\" pizza is $10 - simple! You can add other ingredients onto a list of about 18 specialty pizzas or you can make your own. Each pizza is made to order and takes only about 5 minutes inside of the wood fire oven. I think only 1 or 2 pizzas can be cooked at a time in the oven - so if you're a large group expect your pizzas to arrive at different times.\\n\\nI ordered the Oahu pizza Jamie style. Think Hawaiian but with cinnamon, slivered almonds and coconut. It's a sweeter pizza but still satisfies that savory requirement for dinner. I traded slice-for-slice on the Cherry Bomb pizza - which was a delicious mistake. Seriously, this is one effing hot pizza. I think this pizza should come with a reward if you can finish it all under 10 minutes with nothing to drink. Yeah, I'm talking about Man v. Food.\\n\\nMy only (small) complaint about Bono Pizza is that the pizza itself gets a bit flaccid (never thought I would use the word flaccid when describing a pizza) after a few slices. The heat from the pizza and the plate that it's served on makes the crust, which is delicious, soggy.

The lines aren't too bad  (we went on a weekday for dinner), and the service is pretty solid (sit down versus the other two places I mentioned).\\n\\nHad the Brisket & Slaw dog, and the T-dog. I was surprised that they use a pretty small hot dog, but to be honest, relieved. Seeing as they have so many selections, picking two hot dogs that had huge sausages might have been overwhelming. On the flip side, I wish they focused a bit more  on the hot dog versus the toppings, which they seem to do here.\\n\\nSo the hot dog itself was nothing new. The toppings are copious, fresh, and tasty. Not overly greasy (I really didn't feel crappy after I ate here), and balanced nicely. \\n\\nThe Brisket and Slaw was solid. Smokey and juicy beef, a right amount not to overload the all-beef hot dog. The slaw was diced, not too creamy, and fresh. I was a bit sad it wasn't too much of standout, so it felt like an afterthought. The bun was solid.\\n\\nThe T-dog was delicious. Crispy bacon bits and heaps of shredded cheddar, and nice red bell peppers. Again, a solid dog.\\n\\nAlso had the tater tots covered in cheese and onions.

The sauce was fantastic and I was sad to pop the last one in my mouth. Doubly sad that I gave one up to my wonderful wife. :) I also ordered the happy hour caesar salad with blacked chicken. All I can say is, \\"Get this\\"! Grilled stock of lettuce, blacken chicken and a dressing that was perfect.\\n\\nMy favorite thing about this place is that they are very kid friendly, gluten free friendly, carb free friendly, vegan friendly and if you are non of these very normal friendly.

As a fan of Aaron Franklin's technique, and someone who's borrowed much of it, I absolutely had to see (taste!) for myself his product.

I was admittedly skeptical, but couldn't turn down the opportunity to see for myself, and knew I would walk away at least thankful for the experience. But! This shit is legit. In every way. The fact that the dining room is small and there's just one carver on the line tells you that the integrity in these cooks has been prioritized and maintained, as opposed to competing restaurants who have chosen quantity over quality. Brisket 10/10, pulled pork 12/10 (for reals!), pork ribs 8/10. I didn't even try the sausage. Didn't use any sauce. Didn't eat any bread. Came home with full containers of sides. THAT is how good this Q is. We got in line at 9 with about 60 people ahead of us. We got inside about 11:45, and were eating by 12:15.

(And a sandwich sometime in the later-1990s)  The two meals when ordering from the menu board, very disappointing.  Also, a Sunday brunch visit, and a special event with buffet.  I consider myself a BBQ aficionado, both beef and pork:\\n\\nNov. 07:  Sunday Brunch:   Just ok, waaay overpriced, tooo long of a line (and wait) to get food, Bloody Marys were overpriced.  The beef brisket was just ok, on the dry side, not much flavor.  My wife seemed happy with the experience, .....kind of.  I won't be going back for the brunch.\\n\\nNext visit, March 2008:  A family style gathering of five adults and four children.  The brisket was dry and tough.  The ribs were nothing special.  The BBQ sauce was not very good, and had a strange, lumpy / thick consistency (this is their usual sauce).  The waiter was not very customer friendly when there was a problem at the table, I almost had to call a manager over.  The air conditioning was dripping on 2 or 3 spots at our table  .....Legionnaire's Disease anyone?\\n\\nApril 2008:  Was in for a brief lunch, was going to try the sliced beef sandwich, but a friend offered to buy lunch, so I opted for the less expensive chopped beef sandwich:  What I received:  NOT CHOPPED, some sort of a mound of minced cr_p on a bun, had sauce mixed in prior, but it was a strange dry-ish mound of something resembling DOG FOOD.  Ok, .....again, why does anyone give this place a good review?  Why does anyone like their sauce?  I'm not getting a good experience here.  Would I buy a bottle of Stubb's BBQ Sauce in the grocery store?  .....not on your life (or mine!).\\n\\nMay 2008:  I attended a fundraising function in the downstairs room:  Finally a decent food experience here:  The buffet, which featured beef brisket and chicken, along with sides.  Actually, the food was good, beef was moist this time, still not too much flavor;  chicken was properly cooked, not dry.  Sides decent.  Same strange BBQ sauce.  the bar staff was doing a good job, made good drinks, friendly enough.  Finally I left having had a good time and eating experience.\\n\\nI've seen a number of music shows here over the years, and had a good time at those.  The sandwich I had sometime in the 90s, I seem to remember liking it ......I was drinking at the time, .....at a music show.\\n\\nAs for eating here:  DON'T!!!!  ....unless you're prepared to be disappointed.  If you'll accept lousy food, then you'll probably be satisfied.  Items ordered off the menu should be better than something from the buffet, ....so that one positive buffet experience can't save my review.  One star rating, too harsh?  I think not.

I am happy to say I have finally found a Mexican place that's worth my dough. Yes, it's pricey, but I don't know why that's even worth mentioning. Every single sit down Mexican place in this city is pricey.   Hell, Brown Sugar Cafe is even PRICIER than what it's worth but I (and many others) still go, soo if you don't want to spend a lot of $, then go to yucktastic Qdoba. \\n\\nThis is a First Impression Review- and subject to change (I am damn picky by the way). For now, my review is very positive!!!\\n\\nCame here with 3 other friends. \\n\\nWe loved the chips with pico de gallo salsa. I usually HATE cilantro, but this pico de gallo sauce tasted fine despite that putrid putridness. I don't believe the toriilla chips are homemade- if they are they don't taste like it, but I still enjoyed it.\\n\\nWe loved our food. Me and one friend got the Chicken Poca Madre- two small chicken breasts breaded with tortilla shells on top of a bed of fresh spinach sprinkled with a flavorful-spicy dressing. The chicken was juicy and cooked well. You get two sides- I got the rice and squash, she got the rice and beans. The rice had a nice spicy kick to it. I didn't enjoy the squash. She enjoyed both her rice and beans.\\n\\nAnother friend got the avocado salad- not entirely worth the price she said,but she enjoyed it. \\n\\nOther friend got the Pozzole Soup with fresh seafood and really enjoyed it. She also ordered the Cactus Tinga thinking the soup wouldn't be enough. The soup was in fact enough, but she took her Cactus Tinga home happily- it was delicious (she let us all have a bite). Very spicy, but in a wonderful sort of way.\\n\\nThey have a small wine selection, but I enjoyed my Delicato White Zinfindel (yes I drink dessert wines with my meal)\\n\\nThere were tons of things on the menu that looked delish to me (The Chicken Mole, the flautas, the tostadas, the fajitas, the steak nachos, the Aztec soup, the tortilla soup, the chili con carne, the mexican salad, the Chile Rellenos (minus cilanto and beans if that's possible POR FAVOR), the potato, chorizo and cheese tacos-- yeah all sounds delish and can't wait to come back!!\\n\\nOther notes: it's pretty small on the inside (also very cute).

As a first timer I didn't know what to expect or order, but the counter girls were more than happy to list off menu items and ingredients to help me figure out what I wanted. On a Sunday at noon the line was boomin' out the door and it seemed like this little shop had too many mouths to feed, but they were quick and courteous and helped every guest in a reasonable time. Since it was my first time, I decided to order the vegetarian 7th Trimester and my boyfriend ordered the Southern, and we both ordered the blueberry lemonade aqua fresca. We were able to snag a little table in the corner of the restaurant while we waited for our food. The aqua fresca was amazing, so perfectly sweet and sour and refreshing and summery, I would have paid five dollars a glass! I know they change the flavors but if you ever see the blueberry lemonade again, you have to try it!\\n\\nAbout ten minutes later our food was brought over and for a moment I reconsidered my meal, as my eyes might have been too big for my tummy. My plate was a heaping pile of biscuit, egg, and fried green tomato, surrounded by their signature 5-cheese macaroni. This place is pure Paula Deen decadence! I also ordered a side of grits just to try them, not knowing my boyfriends plate was smothered in the stuff. His southern sandwich was unidentifiable underneath the cheesy grits, which, although disconcerting to him, was quite funny to me. The biscuits are really flavorful and paired well with the fried green tomato, but the star of the show was the mac and cheese. It has such depth and texture, and the cheese sauce was so creamy and rich, I would order this as an item all on its own. Sadly, the grits were not what I wanted them to be. They were piping hot and definitely thick and creamy, but when I took a bite I just couldn't detect any cheese or chives. I was a little bummed but enjoyed my meal nonetheless. My boyfriend loved the biscuits and actually stole one of mine, but also didn't care for the grits. All in all, not a big deal because we just won't order them next time, and there are plenty of other side options that I'm sure will wow me (I'm looking at you home fries and hash browns!) The portions were crazy huge, definitely enough for two or more people, and we could barely finish half of our plates, so we finished up and got some to go boxes.\\n\\nSignature plates like the 7th Trimester and The Southern are an experience that everyone should enjoy, and I can't wait to go back and try something new. Although our brunch was enjoyable and tasty, this biggest disappointment for me was not being able to try any sweets. By the time we finished our meal the line was not only out the door, but wrapped around the restaurant, and I wasn't sure if I was willing to wait that long for some cakes. This is partially my fault as I did come here on a Sunday afternoon when everyone wants a piece of this place.

The upside to all of this avoidance was that we were able to enjoy Levant before it disappeared.  When we finally did go to Screen Door, we realized that if you are going solo or in a pair, you can usually get seated immediately, provided you are open to sitting at the bar or on their (heated) patio. I can't speak to the fried chicken plate except to say that it is larger than my head; last night they had a cook dedicated to pounding and breading chicken.

I was already excited when I saw they lowered their prices from the last time I was there. I decided to order what I got last time but the whole shebang this time;burger,fries and a shake. Since the damned burger doesn't come with cheese, they also get you an extra 50 cents for that. The whole things came to about $13! Common, this fast food, not fine dining. \\nAfter paying that I was prepared for a meal beyond meals. The shake, alright. It was a chocolate shake. The fries, again, alright. Better when I added salt. The burger,(turkey), why do they have so much trouble with a burger?

Lately, the quality seems to have fallen quite a bit, so when we went there for dinner last night we hadn't been in several months. We sat down and asked for the special menu, which they no longer put out at the tables (it costs $25 pp for an appetizer to share, an entree, a drink, and a movie ticket at the theater next door). Our server's expression immediately dimmed and she told us that she didn't know if they still did the special and she would have to check. She came back with our menus and we asked her to describe the fish special. Again, she had to find out what it was. She gave us what turned out to be a false description, as the fish that came out was not what she described and the sides were different. The \\"sauteed\\" fish was a soggy breaded mess, and was not even the same species that she described. I buried it in the overcooked rice hoping that it would soak up a little of the oil that was gathering on my plate (you could see it floating in the pools of \\"white wine sauce\\"), but all that ended up accomplishing was soaking my rice, rendering the entire plate inedible. Our server returned and took our plates, saying nothing about the fact that I had taken only one tiny bite of fish. There was something (a drill? a coffee grinder? a chainsaw?) making loud noise the entire time we were there, and there was also a table full of yelling children seated right in the middle of the restaurant next to the bar area. To say that the atmosphere was terrible is an understatement and I can't believe that the food was even worse. We were planning to stay for coffee and dessert and then going to see our movie, but we had  such a terrible experience that we ended up skipping the movie and going somewhere else for a better dinner. We ended up spending about $100 at Apres Diem including our extra drinks and tip, and it was $100 wasted, besides the movie tickets. The service was terrible, the atmosphere was awful, and the food was the worst I have had at a restaurant in years.

We frequently eat at the location on Best Rd, but decided to give this one a chance. The hotel and the restaurant are beautiful. I definitely enjoyed the decor. I noticed that there are two menus on the website and we were given the starts and shares menu. It wasn't busy, even for a Saturday night, so we were seated pretty quickly. To start, we ordered the prosciutto goat cheese flatbread. I personally haven't eaten pork in 8 years, so we got half of it without it so that i didn't have to eat it. I am probably the biggest lover of goat cheese and arugula, so those were the most enjoyable parts of it for me. The slices were larger than I expected and the tomato sauce was a little chilled. I barely tasted the fig balsamic that was supposed to be on there. \\n\\nTo eat, my mom and I both ordered the grilled stack. She ordered the chicken and I ordered the salmon, however we both chose to substitute the green beans for asparagus and my mom ordered hers without the olives. It took a little while for our entrees to come out, same with our appetizers, but mine came out with chicken instead of salmon! Instead of taking my entire plate back, they let me try the chicken and the vegetables and potatoes while they cooked me a piece of salmon. The chicken was okay, but I had my hopes up for the salmon so I couldn't really enjoy it. The vegetables were good and the potatoes were cooked al dente, which my mom didn't like. I would've preferred for them to be cooked a little softer too, or at least be more of a fried potato cake. When my salmon came out, it was tasty and cooked to perfection. I just wish that I could've enjoyed it from the start.\\n\\nFor desert we tried the Georgia Pecan Tart which is atop caramel sauce and comes with a side of ice cream. My mom indulged more than I did but overall it was good! Service was.. okay. Our waitress was cool but inattentive and would disappear for long periods of time. Thankfully they charged us for a grilled chicken stack despite me getting the salmon which was $2 more as a way to rectify the error.

The host said he wouldn't be able to get us in for 11, but could squeeze us in for 11:30. I asked whether it would be too late to take advantage of the special. He said ordinarily, yes, but that he would make sure that we still got it when we arrived. I thanked him profusely.\\n\\nWe got there around 11:20 and squeezed past the throng of people waiting to be seated to let the host know we'd arrived. Around 11:45 we were seated, and the waiter, Raoul, let us know that it had been communicated to him that we were getting the brunch special. In spite of the fact that we were doing this whole thing on the cheap past their usual time for the offering, Raoul was quite attentive and seemed present--eye contact and smiles all around. He brought us two orders of complimentary blue cornbread with tasting trays of spreads--chipotle cranberry, habanero apricot, and honey molasses butter. Delicious. I just about licked up the extra sauce with my fingers, but I managed to restrain myself, as the restaurant's a pretty classy place.\\n\\nI ordered the caramelized plantain empanada with Mexican cinnamon cream cheese--tiny but delicious; the cream cheese is one of the tastiest things I've ever had--and the huevos rancheros, along with a side of home fries. One of my friends ordered the granola and yogurt, also with the huevos rancheros, and the other ordered the mixed fruit and creamy eggs with bacon. All of the first courses were quite small, but the second courses were sizable enough that, along with the cornbread, we were all hard-pressed to finish our meals. We received free coffee and tea along with the meal, and the total bill came to $31. \\n\\nI was concerned that we might feel out of place or that the fanciness of the spot (rows of tables covered with white cloths in the dining room, felt like a good place for a wedding reception) might go hand-in-hand with snobby service, but that was not the case at all.

Kylie Jenner is the face of their chain so of course I had to go. I was really disappointed when I got their and she had left already. \\n\\nWalking into the sugar factory the decor is nice. Black and white. Very chic. They have a candy store connected to the restaurant, I thought that was very cute. \\n\\nThe wait time, of course, was over an hour so we found three seats at the bar. We were greeted by Leanne the bartender and the head bartender who I can't remember her name. She gave us a break down of the menu and drinks and then gave us time to order. The menu is awesome. Prices are high but I was expecting that. \\n\\nNow on to the good stuff. The drinks are amazing. You can get a goblet regular or martini and all of their drinks are able to be made virgin. They use dry ice which creates the illusion of steam when the drink is poured over it. It's super cool  the drinks are really worth the money. I ordered the cotton candy martini. Well worth the fifteen dollars. \\n\\nThe food was mediocre. You could tell that if it wasn't grand opening night it may have come out better, cause the quality of it isn't so bad. I ordered the New York strip medium rare, with mashed potatoes and asparagus. When it came it was mid well and more warm than hot. Also, it looked like it had been sitting for awhile in the back. It tasted okay. It wasn't worth 30 dollars though. \\n\\nService: the service was ok. They had three bartenders and one head bartender helping. With a full bar, and maybe 25 seats at best, it could have been better. When we asked for our checks she gave us one so we asked for them to be split so she gave us a bit of an attitude. But we're all servers so we let it go. No one besides the head bartender and Leanne spoke to us besides a bar back for waters. And no one asked how we liked our food. \\n\\nTo sum it up, I probably wouldn't go back to the sugar factory. Maybe for a drink but that's about it. The food isn't worth the price and the service is lacking. I only say this cause I'm a server and I know what's expected of me. Leanne told us they had been open since December, so you think they would have ran a smoother run. They were a bit short staffed for the volume and bar and menu knowledge isn't the only important thing in the business. Costumer service matters too.

That being said, there were high and lows with coming here. Let me cover the good things first.\\n\\n1.) DELICIOUS FOOD: The food is, by and large, quite tasty. They had a chili-like soup that I thought was quite good and I also got a tasty (...and reasonably priced) Grilled Chicken Piadina for an appetizer. The main entr√©e (Chicken & Shrimp Carbonara) earned a spot both in the pros AND cons. On the pro side, it was very delicious.... and one of the main reasons why I go out to eat is because I enjoy eating delicious food and I suck at cooking.  So, they definitely get points for great-tasting food... and as stupid as this might sound, one of the highlights of the meal, for me, were actually the breadsticks. Wow, very warm and delicious breadsticks; slightly salty and oily to the touch, but in a good way. The breadsticks are great for dipping, too, if your meal has any sauce in it which, it seems, most of the Olive Garden meals do.\\n\\n2.) HIGH-TECH: Olive Garden definitely isn't afraid to go high tech, whether it's watching one of their flat-screen TVs or ordering and paying for food right on your own table tablet. Each table had an upright tablet you could use to order food, play games, and pay the bill. It even allows for a tip calculation and defaults to 20%, though you can adjust it either way (....I typically tip 20% anyway, so it was very convenient). It even lets you choose whether to get a paper receipt or have a receipt emailed to you. I chose the latter which will come into play momentarily when I go over the cons.\\n\\nOkay, now for the less-than-flattering aspects.\\n\\n1.) HOST DEVOID OF ALL HAPPINESS:  The \\"host\\" was a guy with virtually no life, pulse, or personality in him at all. Generally speaking, the purpose of having a restaurant host is to try and do a few things:\\n\\na.) Greet you.\\nb.) Make you feel somewhat welcome.\\nc.) Lead you to your seat.\\nd.) Give you a menu.\\n\\nTo the host's credit, he did Part D very well, but that was about it.\\n\\nHis idea of greeting me was a nod and a \\"hey.\\" I've greeted my proctologist with more warmth than that. In fact, after his \\"hey,\\" he just kinda stood there with a, \\"Well, what the hell do YOU want?\\" kind of look about him.... to the point where I had to say, \\"Umm.... table for one if you have one available?\\" He grabbed a menu and did a bit of an \\"over here\\" motion with his head as he walked away from me. I interpreted that as, \\"follow me, ass-face\\" so I went with him. I sat down, he gave me a menu and said, \\"Your server will be right up.\\"\\n\\nAnd that was basically it for my interaction with the host. Okay.\\n\\n2.) WAITER DEVOID OF ALL CHARISMA: The waiter wasn't much better than the host. Remember that receipt I opted to have emailed to me? Well, it gave the name of my waiter which was listed as \\"Ebony T.\\" (...I swear I'm not making this up) and although he was somewhat conscious during the shift, he never smiled. Never even came close. He just seemed really miserable to be there or... you know... alive. But to his credit, he did answer my one question about the types of soups they had, so he gets points for job competency. I just felt as though I was an inconvenience in his day, like the way dogsh*t is an inconvenience on the bottom of your shoe... and that's never a good feeling to have, regardless of WHERE you are.\\n\\n3.) MEAL OPTIONS: The selection of meals, overall, seemed somewhat scarce. Don't get me wrong, the meals they DID have on the menu looked amazing, but their \\"menu\\" is basically a brochure with large time-share photos of the few mouth-watering meals they offer and if they DO have other options, not all of them seemed to merit menu space. Hell, my appetizer came with an errant French fry and I was like, \\"Wait, they have fries here? How did I MISS that?\\" Yeah, apparently they weren't even on the menu. And unless I completely missed it, they don't seem to have a kid's menu, either. Maybe they do and they just didn't give me one because I was dining as a lone adult, so I'll give them the benefit of a doubt on that one.\\n\\n4.) THE GREAT SHRIMP FAMINE: So... I get that shrimp is expensive. I really do... but it's not so expensive that a restaurant charging almost $20.00 for a plate of pasta with a few errant chunks of chicken would go broke putting a little more than just four pieces of shrimp on the plate. Yes, I counted. Did I complain? No, because the menu gives no shrimp minimum, but for crying out loud, FOUR PIECES? Seriously? And it's too bad, too, because the meal was delicious even as it lacked shrimp.\\n\\nBeyond that, this is a solid restaurant, both figuratively AND literally (...the outside of the place looks like a lavish, hurricane-proof fortress).

This was a horrible first time customer experience. We ordered a mango smoothie and the lady put jelly's or something in it. It was very off putting with no flavor. I ordered some soup that came out with cooked blood in it, fried tofu, tomatoes, crumbled pork or some mystery meat. The broth was flavorful. The noodles were way over cooked. My wife was terrified by the blood. Its ok.... kind of like meat jello. They were open pretty late when a lot of other places were closed in the plaza. I am guessing because they don't make the amount of money there competitors do. Maybe this place was too authentic for me........

The walkway was so tiny that your server could hardly fit behind you, and it being so loud she also couldn't hear you but she was very nice, very friendly and helpful when she could get to you.\\n\\nNow to the food, I think it need some work.  I got the pork crackling for an appetizer, don't get that, it was gross.  Maybe it just wasn't for me and I didn't know what I was getting myself into but I did not like it.

Our server Valerie saw that we were cramped at the first table that we were at and reseated us into a huge booth that was indeed more comfortable for our party of four. \\n\\nMy niece and brother in law started out with the Tomato Basil Bisque.  They enjoyed the creaminess and the richness of the bisque as well as the fresh tomato flavor of the soup.\\n\\nDinner was outstanding. My sister and I both ordered the Honey Ginger Lime Salmon Salad and received a huge portion of salmon encrusted in well seasoned spices.  Atop the salmon was a delicious mix of mango-pineapple salsa.  I enjoyed the spiced marinated beets. The onions, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and sesame dressing added to the cool flavor of the salad with the warm salmon.  My sister asked to have her dressing on the side which is the way she enjoys it.  We felt this was the best salad we had this year.\\n\\nMy niece raved about her Smoked Salmon Avocado Salad.  She enjoyed the way it was prepared and not overdone.  It was moist with a hint of smokiness.  She loved the sauce that accompanied the dish.  The next time I visit, I'll try this dish.\\n\\nMy brother in law enjoyed his Crab, Shrimp, and Avocado Salad.  There was a lot of crab and shrimp that made the dish worthwhile.\\n\\nWe saved enough room for dessert and ordered the Oregon Three Berry Crisp. The Raspberry, Marionberry, and Blueberry Compote was mixed into an oatmeal crust that was served hot and went well with coffee. The berries were tart and sweet and blended well with the oatmeal crust.  \\n\\nThe other dessert that we ordered was the Chocolate Banana Cream Pie. The dish was served cold and it tasted like cool ice cream mixed in with the bananas and the dark rich chocolate flavoring of the crust.  The filling of the pie had a nice creaminess and peanut buttery flavor, with chunks of bananas inside the filling.  We loved the rich chocolate crust of the pie, too.\\n\\nThis restaurant has a nice ambiance to it. We enjoyed looking at the photos and the decor. We also loved the attentiveness of the servers.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"For years, my partner and I had heard about this restaurant.  So when we had the opportunity (this past Saturday) to take the Atlanta Movie Tour, we wanted to hop over and see what everyone was talking about.  This day was in celebration of my other half's birthday and I wanted something out of the norm and special.   \\n\\nWell, to start with, it's a bit of a confusing set up.  From best I can tell, it's three separate dining spaces and a shop.  We arrived about 1:30pm. When we arrived, I needed to use the restroom.  I was unsure where it was, and I asked a staff member.  He simply pointed into the shop. (Not a lot of help.)  We walked into the the first restaurant off Walker St. The sign said to \\"seat yourself.\\"  I'm certain we looked puzzled but no one came up and asked to assist.  So we walked to the patio and took a seat.  Again, no one came up to assist.  So we went into the first dining spot and asked the bar tender if they were open for service.  He said that they were doing brunch on their side and full service in the other dining room.  So we went to the full service location.\\n\\nThe setting and the decore were nice.  It seemed to be going well and we were seated promptly.  The Hostess greeted us and seated us promptly.  Our waiter came and took our order.  I had the Enchiladas De Espinaca and my partner had Pollo Relleno.  Both were certainly good.  My Carne Asada was tough and chewy.  Now mind you, I never expect Carne Asada to be an \\"amazing\\" cut of meat, but I do expect it to be tender. It was not tender and was not nearly as flavorful as the Pablano Chicken. At this price point, I would expect both dishes to be something a bit more special.  Again, they were not.  The rice and the beans were probably the most special part of my meal.  \\n\\nWhere they seem to drop the ball is service.  My partner (at one point) dropped his fork.  He stopped the Host as he came by and let him know.  Another fork never arrived.  In fact, the Host disappeared to the Host station.  My partner went off and took one from the servers station.  Our waiter was friendly and polite. He conversed and was great when he was there. But it was far from attentive.  There were huge swaths of time where we saw no one. I don't like to have servers to trip over you while you're eating, but it would have been nice to have your water cup filled at least once.   \\n\\nSo ... we came, we tried and we likely will not be back. That's not to say that it was a \\"horrible\\" experience but here are simply to many places in the Atlanta Area that specialize in Mexican and Mexican Fusion.  No Mas was simply OK..."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"5351 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"First time in a LongHorn and the menu looked good.

There is no way they didn't make those greens without some sort of drug in it because I couldn't stop eating them.  The chicken was good but not great. Far better than anything you could get at a fast food place. No comparison but not the best I've had either.\\n\\nRibs were not on point . I would probably not get the ribs again at all. I also hated the baked beans. To me and I repeat to me the beans tasted like a bowl of mustard.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore but I hate mustard.

I was also expecting to get splashed by water, but none of that happened.  \\n\\nI was scared my son wouldn't sit through the show.  He didn't eat his meal because he was so enthralled by all the acting and commotion since he's not used to live acts so I was proud of him, but they just had to have an intermission, and we were the only ones to walk out of there because he had already lost interest.

Within the city limits there is no question that the most famous location for carefully smoked meats is Franklin's.  If you read reviews of other BBQ spots in Austin you will notice that the scale for quality is Franklin (\\"almost as good as Franklin\\", \\"Better than Franklin\\", shorter wait than Franklin\\").  If everyone is comparing BBQ to one place it makes sense that you should go to the one place.  But, what do you do if the place you want to go to has a 4 hour line?  If waiting in your line is your thing then Franklin does seem to be a fun hang.   But, if you are trying to maximize your vacation then 4 hours in a parking lot in the hot Texas sun may not be the most efficient use of your time.  So, you do more research you find out that if you preorder you don't have to wait in line.\\n\\nThe preorder system at Franklin requires preparation and appetite.  The prep is knowing when you are going to want to pick up the food.  They open the online preorders a month before the pickup day and times do sell out so like Ticketmaster you have to get in early to make sure you secure your feast.  The appetite required is a 4 lb minimum.  You cannot just preorder a couple of sandwiches.  Just like Texas Hold 'Em you have to be ALL-IN.  Once your designated pickup time arrives you go to a green trailer behind the main Franklin's building and tell them you have arrived.  They then start to prepping your order slicing it up fresh for each customer.  It takes 15 minutes so enjoy a complementary beverage (like local favorite Topo Chico sparkling water) and explore the property.  Gawk at the line that wraps around the outside of the property and even check in with the pitmaster.  Before your know it your order will be ready and it is time for you to decide if this is the best barbecue you have ever tasted.\\n\\nWe got a wide variety of meats sides and desserts.  Everything was packaged up with the traditional fixins (white bread, onions, pickles, multiple BBQ sauces) so you are not missing anything that you could get in the standard restaurant.  The ribs, turkey and brisket were insanely good, possibly the best I have ever tasted.  Tender and smoked to perfection.  The other meats were great too but not as memorable.  You could skip some of them but if you are buying 4 lbs of meat you probably want to spread the choices around so that you can try everything.  The sides weren't all that remarkable with the baked beans being the best of the bunch.  The little pies they have for dessert are fantastic especially the banana bourbon and the lemon chess.  Their prices are kinda high but they could be a lot higher considering the 4 hour line.  I was happy that I got the Franklin experience so now I too can compare it to all future and past BBQ I eat."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the vegetable pakora and veggie samosa with garlic roti.

Have always enjoyed the food.  However, the last few times food has gone downhill.  Not as fresh as before.  For lunch today, I ordered miso soup and pork katsu.  The tofu in the soup wasn't fresh -- there were small chewy bits, suggestive of dried-out tofu.   The pork had that \\"been in the refrigerator too long\\" taste.   I was surprised and disappointed.  We've never had issues with food freshness at any of the other Asian restaurants nearby (e.g., Vietnamese pho, a couple Asian buffets, Japanese).

And I noticed that when I asked for another chair to put my legs on (I have horrible diabetic neuropathy and if a chair hits my legs in the wrong place I can't move for a day or two) he started treating us like we weren't  good enough to be there! And nothing makes you feel like trash when you get treated like that. Also if I'm going to pay$200 for dinner the service better be just as good as the food! I gave this place 4 stars because the food was soooooooo good! The place is kinda crowed for seating and it was loud in there as well, hard to carry on and intimate convo with anyone you're setting with!

It's super busy and has a special traffic configuration. On a normal day, access is available from both Lincoln Street and 138 though. \\n\\nIf you never have been to Sonic before, it's a chain of (fast food) restaurants selling burgers, hot dogs, chicken, as well as a full breakfast menu. Lots of soda, slushies and even Jolly Rancher flavored drinks! \\nAlso an full ice cream menu with Sonic Blasts, shakes, sundaes and more. I will post some pictures of the paper menu they gave to customers on the first day. \\nOverall, food is pretty good, and I would suggest it (but if you aren't a fan of greasy and heavy stuff, this place may not be the right fit....), but isn't always too filling. Burgers are only $6.49 for a combo meal, so if you're hungry just get two!\\nAlso, anyone should know there are three ways to eat here. Inside (sort of self explanatory), from the drive thru (just drive right through!), or at the drive in station. The drive in station at this Sonic has 9 car stalls and you order from the station and someone brings out your food to serve to you (the guy today was flying around the parking lot in rollerblades!). While it may always be busy, it's a interesting and different concept from other fast food chains. \\nService was extremely good today (especially considering how busy they are) and I'm looking forward to making this place a regular stop when I'm in Stoughton. \\nIn closing, good job Sonic. You have my business and I would suggest this to anyone searching for a good, quick environment for food in the Stoughton area."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Met a friend here for dinner and thought it was pretty tasty!

Lastly, I had the petit fours dessert- six penny sized crackers with raspberry ice cream. I felt like I was ripped off for $7, especially compared to the other desserts our group had ordered.

The truffle fries came out first, and were alright but not very crispy, covered in what seemed like an alfredo-like goo instead of the parmesan cheese that was promised. We both had bourbon cocktails, which were strong and pretty tasty. The salad I had was decent, with the greens being everything I needed and more after a day of amusement park food, but the seared ahi on top was super dry and flavorless, giving it almost a 'fake' texture. It reminded me of when tomatoes are picked too early, ripen off the vine, and then are dry and mealy. I think only crushed ginger comes on top as a dressing, but I asked for a side of the ginger dressing, and it was perfect on top.\\n\\nThe k-town burger my boyfriend grabbed looked good, and was cooked to a true medium like he asked.

I was early for a reservation so I took a trip through the attached store.  Fun stuff!  The store is really fun.  My first impression of the restaurant was that it was a place that I was really going to like a lot.  The service did not stand up to the atmosphere at all and that was apparent before I even met my server.  The hostess, nice the first time I asked if anyone had checked in for our reservation, was obviously annoyed with me when I asked the 2nd time.  The 3rd inquiry, nearly 35 minutes after my arrival and after the reservation time, was met with a down right rude and annoyed answer. I thought about leaving but I was there to meet friends for a birthday gathering.  They would not seat us for our reservation until 75%  of our party had arrived so rather than spending money (!!) noshing and drinking while I waited for my friends, I had one beer standing in a corner in the bar.  The bartender was really nice.  Have you noticed that all I have talked about so far is the service?  That's because the food really didn't make that much of an impression, and it certainly didn't overcome my other feelings.  The chips and salsa were good.  I had the Pollo Relleno and it was a great choice: a thin chicken breast atop cilantro mashed potatoes all covered with poblano peppers, cheese, and salsa verde.  I think the prices are a little high ($10 for an ice cream scoop of guacamole and a side of cheese).  The decor, the overall feeling of the restaurant made me think I was going to love it.

I tried the brisket, chicken, and pulled pork- They were all DELICIOUS! The brisket was tender and fell apart on my fork, the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the pulled pork was packed with deliciousness. Top it all of (in true Texas fashion) with a  lot of BBQ sauce, and I was one happy camper. They gave us lots of pickles, jalepenos, and onions as a side, along with bread to sop up the greasey saucey mess that's left over (my second favorite part of BBQ in Texas). The baked beans and potato salad sides were very tastey as well. \\nOverall I was very satisfied with the service and food, and would love to return when I'm in Austin again.

My dish was actually undercooked for my liking, and I requested to have it cooked longer.  They were very apologetic and took responsibility, even though I don't think it was probably their fault. I'm just a picky eater needing things cooked somewhat well done.  The chef herself brought my dish back out and apologized. It was just nice to feel they really cared about their food and they obviously strive to have things right the first time.   My drink was awesome though I don't remember the name. It was one of their Signature drinks. The macaroon dessert was incredible!  Huge enough for 2 people.   I am definitely a fan and will be back!  My new favorite restaurant in Portland.

I can't say that it is my favorite place to get ribs but it is decent. I can't say that the ribs are bad, it really comes down personal preference. The ribs are very fatty and hard to eat if that makes sense. You have to do a lot of picking around the fat and tough bits.

Lately I've been on a ramen binge and I've been having ramen at least once a week. This week, I went twice! Every time I take my first scoop of the broth, it's like heaven in my mouth. Before going to Ramen Tatsu-ya, I absolutely hated ramen. Now I can't live without it! \\n \\nWhat I like about RT is their broth. You can tell that it's been stewing for hours on hours. It's thick and milky and the flavors are full-bodied. I've tried almost everything so I'll give a quick spiel about the different bowls. \\n\\nThe original tonkotsu: is a pork/chicken broth that comes with ramen noodles, black mushrooms, a soy sauce soft-boiled egg and chashu (pork belly that has been braised in a soy sauce and literally melts in your mouth.) \\nI always order the original because the broth is straight to the point and has less of a muddled flavor. \\n\\nthe sho-yu tonkotsu: is also a pork/chicken based broth but has a lot of soy sauce in it-- hence the word \\"sho-yu.\\" it comes with ramen, black mushrooms, menma bamboo, egg, chashu. A lot of my friends enjoy ramen tatsuya but they think it's way too salty. if you're sensitive to sodium, i don't recommend having the sho-yu. IMO it's too salty and makes me overwhelmed before finishing the bowl.\\n\\nMi-so-hot:\\nThe Mi-so-hot is a sapporo or miso-flavored broth with ramen, corn, scallions, egg, and ground pork. The Mi-so-hot is different from the tonkotsu because it has a variety of different flavors in the broth. It has the same rich broth but with multiple kicks!  Out of all the bowls, the Mi-so-hot I feel is the most dynamic (though not my favorite.) \\n\\nTsukemen:\\nDipping noodles with a thick tangy broth on the side. For me the Tsukemen is too rich and has complimentary flavors that get tiring after a while. Some people absolutely love it-- it's not for me though.\\n\\n\\nDesserts: Try to the cocopioca! It's awesome. It's a tapioca pudding (made with coconut milk,) with strawberry, cilantro, lemon zest and sugar on top. It's the right mixture of creamy and freshness.\\n\\n\\nI always recommend adding spicy bombs to your ramen. I always get the fire in a bowl. so freakin' good."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I'll give them full credit for their food, which is obviously why I looked into using their catering services. They seemed like a reputable company for catering since that is how Fox Bros. got it's start. It's a little more pricey than most BBQ places that cater, but since the food is so good we thought it would be worth it.\\n\\n All was well until we received the contract. After promptly receiving a proposal that detail our food items, quantity, service, along with the total cost, I asked for a contract. When I was sent the contract only the total cost was given and none of the food or service specifics were even mentioned. I told Fox Bros. I was not comfortable signing a contract in which I agree to pay a specific amount of money when the specifics for what I am buying are not listed. (Here's an ehow article that states this is standard :http://www.ehow.com/how_4968946_write-catering-contract.html) They told me they would have to run the changes by a lawyer and it would take a few days. A few days later, I received an updated contract with the food and service listed and the price for each item but not the quantity. Even more egregious, the amounts did not match what was initially listed on the proposal and because the quantities were not listed it was difficult to discern why. Also, the total was added incorrectly. It literally did not add up. When I pointed this out they asked me to write up an amendment to the contract (which to me, sounded a lot like they were asking me to their job). I asked them to simply include the proposal. They did, but did not change the wording of the contract, so it stated \\"agree to pay for the following items\\" etc. but since the list had been eliminated, there were not items listed so it looked like we were not getting anything. I asked for this to be changed. \\n\\nThe next contract did not have the wording changed at all, but instead included the list from the previous contract, with none of the quantities and all of the math errors exactly the same as before in an entirely different section. Expressing my frustration and once again pointing out all the same mistakes they had made before, I received a reply that in order to change the wording of the contract I would need to pay their lawyer.

The food was absolutely delicious, and service was excellent as well as providing superb recommendations.  We were excited such a great place had opened so close to home (live in Fenway within a few blocks).   After that meal we went out of our way to recommend people try it out. \\n\\nFast forward to tonight- eating outdoors on the patio in the \\"expo kitchen\\"  area was nice, but that was about the end of the positives for the evening.  Staff was not knowledgeable about what options would be safe to eat for being gluten free and went back to ask multiple times (this is normally ok of course, and is generally a good thing. I would much rather be safe than sorry!).  Specifically asked about a few individual items since no suggestions were offered, and decided on the Brussels Caesar salad and lamb nachos (interesting concept, but sounded awesome).  After claiming these were some of the few items that would be gluten free, but looking back probably  had no idea and didn't ask the chef.  Made sure to ask if the chips were being fried in the same oil, and was assured that they were corn chips fried first thing in the morning before anything else was cooked in the fryolator (cross contamination is a serious concern with any fried items).  Asked if they were fried again before being served and was told no.   So, that's  the general gist of the gluten based questions.   The rest of the party had one of the pasta dishes, another Caesar, a chicken dish, potatoes appetizer, and the focaccia pizza slice.    Theirs seemed OK (the pasta was very well received, and exclaimed to be delicious), except the pizza was burnt and soaked through in oil.  The relatively small slice (for $6) was left unfinished. \\n\\nEverything came out individually, quite far apart over about 30 minutes with the potatoes and chicken being the last items.   I understand that items are brought out \\"as they become ready\\" to maximize the experience, but we were never told this and some of the dishes had clearly been sitting for quite a while before they got to our table. \\n\\nFor the gluten free items: The Caesar was drowned in dressing, and the chips for the nachos were burnt and the lamb was dry.   Most importantly, about 45 min to an hour later (the time it takes me to process gluten), I got sick.   I'll spare the details but it's not pleasant and lasts for a few days and sometimes up to two weeks.  \\n\\nDespite the great first experience (maybe give the main room a try if you haven't been, it really was excellent that one time), we are now too concerned it was a fluke where we got lucky that one time.  Avoid tapestry like the plague if you have celiacs or a gluten allergy.  \\n\\nWill not be returning."},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"yeah.\\n\\nLet me first try to write this review in the restaurant's native language. *ahem*\\n\\n\\"Meat.

Their hot on Yelp, and, per the reviews, they're nearly perfect in every which way and frequently run out of meat.  I've driven by several times and almost always notice a long line, or they've had to closed shop early.  This time I went around Noon and told myself to tough it out, and I'm so glad I did. \\n\\nIf a queue is present, be prepared to wait about 20-25 min.  Once you get up to the counter you'll notice one of the cooks is a dead ringer for Eli Roth (film maker).  He'll cut you piece of what he has on the cutting board so you can try before you buy.  For me, I had to get everything on the menu in order to get the full experience, so I got the 2 meat plate (ribs + brisket) w/ 2 sides (beans + potato salad).  I also got some lean brisket and their special chopped beef + sausage sandwich to go.  They work as efficiently as they can w/ only 2 guys preparing the meals while one person rings you up.  It's all premium priced, but how's it taste?  \\n\\nWell I'd easily say they have the best ribs in town - - no joke.  Real smoky, nice crust, and falls off the bone.  The fatty brisket was superb, had a nice crust and is full of goodness.  The lean was pretty darn good, not too dry as you would normally expect.  The sausage is just sausage, no biggie, but still tastes good.  The potato salad is real mustardy, the cole slaw is pretty good - love the red cabbage, and the beans are beans.  \\n\\nNow for the \\"Four Saucemen\\":  the Expresso Sauce was my fave, it's a darker consistency and you can taste the molasses and expresso.  If those 2 combos don't appeal to you then you may not be a fan.  My other fave was the Sweet Sauce, and they also have Hot and Pork (vinegar) sauces too.  I liked them all so much I ended up mixing the expresso + sweet + hot and came up w/ a combination that was outta this world!!  I had to ask for an extra container to take some of my concoction home.  \\n\\nThe service is excellent, they aim to please, and they really do this BBQ thing right.  It's well worth the wait and the price, I highly suggest you take the time and check out this homey operation because you won't regret it, and it also reminds you of what makes Austin such a great place.

It's about $4 just for one tiny empanada, and while I would be happier if it came with two for that price, I have to say its worth every penny.  It's truly heaven in your mouth!!! without a doubt one of the most delicious things I've had with breakfast."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Alright, so the first time I went to this place, I would say that they probably earned 4 stars, but this time, they lost a star for service and bathroom cleanliness. \\n\\nWe went at 10:30 am this time around and were seated immediately. However, the food selection this past weekend was not quite there. They didn't have as many types of food as they did a few months ago. On top of that there were a few carts that had lingered on the OTHER side of the restaurant for the whole 2 hours we were there. At one point we ended up going to the cart to get the food, but she said she'd be over. At even then it took her another half an hour to get to us. She went to everyone else first before she came to us.  But then after getting us that one dish, we had asked her for another that is on her cart. She then said okay, and WALKED AWAY WITH HER CART! WTF!!! 20 minutes later, some random lady brought us the dish. We said we had ordered that a long time ago, and she still put it on our table and put it on our dim sum card! Lady - we don't even want it anymore, we're done with our dim sum! \\n\\n\\nThe food is still good, don't get me wrong, but for service around here, it sux! You don't get the attention you should be getting. \\n\\nThe bathroom is gross. There were 2 toilets that were clogged and not one restaurant personnel came to fix them. On a busy Sunday morning, and only 2 toilets in the rest room! Blehhhh! \\n\\nDoes anyone know if the garage knows that this place is charging $6 to get your parking validated?! I'm not sure if they have a contract our not, but it is the most silly thing I have heard. I have to pay $6 here to get my $10 back. Why don't they just friggin' validate my parking and give me $4 back in the garage instead?! Does that NOT make sense? \\n\\nOh and if you're like me and not a real big fan of FOBs, this might not be the place for you.

Okay, last time I tried to eat here, on two consecutive days, about two years ago, first day at 10 am I was told that it was 3-4 hour wait and they would probably be out of food...I left. Next day, about 9 am, I was told it was 3-4 hour wait, and there would be food, but someone ahead of me had a large rib order, so probably no ribs...I left.\\n\\nRecently I was headed back down south for a couple of days, so I figured I would leave the big FTW early and see how bad the line was going to be on a midweek day, but honestly figured it would be long enough I could easily talk myself out of getting in it. Ended up rounding the corner about 8:30 and to my amazement there were only about ten people in line. I parked, grabbed my folding chair and got in line, figuring this was my best chance for the next couple of years and I better take it.\\n\\nHonestly, in this day and age, sat down, had a bottled water and my phone, so time went pretty fast. Line was great, saw no shenanigans, and about 9 am the employees came outside, opened up the restrooms inside and there was an igloo type cooler of water for everyone. Coffee truck comes by and they work the line with drinks occasionally, so the wait, (under the shade anyway) was very bearable.\\n\\nDoors opened at 11 am, there were just ten or so people ahead of me, so I got my BBQ about 11:30. Just one guy cutting meat, one guy working sides, and one at the register. Yes, the line could move faster with more people, but that's their decision, so deal with it, I guess. Most of the people in front of me were getting mass quantities so that didn't help, and I saw a lot of talking, questioning, and general discussing going on, so that slows it down some obviously. Also, you crazy people taking pictures, selfies, and VIDEO in the line need to stop, sheesh, for gawds sake!\\n\\nI was eating here, so I got a 1/2 pound of ribs, brisket, and a 1/4 sausage. Grabbed a bourbon banana pie for later. There are about eight or so tables inside with 4-8 chairs each, depending on size. I grabbed a chair and got to rooting. The ribs were great, the rub seemed perfect, just the right amount and added a good flavor. Moist, tender, seemed like they kept them in a steamer, dunno, no idea, but if not then they need to patent the process they use to keep them like this without doing so. Brisket was really good as well, and the sausage was really good, good flavor, but I didn't consider it spicy, or hot. Tried everything without sauce, ended up eating both ribs without sauce, but tried the various sauces on some of the brisket and sausage. The espresso and sweet sauce I liked, but I've never cared for vinegar, watery BBQ sauces like the other one.\\n\\nI guess I could go on about everything else, that's probably been said a million times in the other reviews here, but...Obviously you expect high end BBQ out of Franklin's and it delivered, for me anyway. I thought the ribs were some of the best I've had. I mainly wanted to see how it would compare to other \\"high end, craft\\" BBQ places I've been to and enjoyed, like Pecan Lodge, Killens, Blacks of Lockhart, and recently Heim BBQ...are a few of my favorites. The real answer is that Franklin's is another one of those places making great BBQ, the only difference being the taste is different just like it is at those other places. Example, I thought the brisket here was great, but I prefer the brisket at one of the other places, but that's all about individual taste, right...right?\\n\\nAnyway, if you don't believe that then you're probably a hater elitist, and your opinion means nothing anyway. Hey, what do I know? Franklin's was durn good all the way around, that's what I do know."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the fried chicken here which was absolutely amazing.

I was listening to the noon concert this week at CBC and saw this little truck down the street in front of the queen Elizabeth playhouse, a bit down from where yelp is showing it.  \\n\\nDuck, pork belly, and beef cheeks.  What to order?  Luckily I had the DC with me and we got a duck and the beef cheeks.  They were even nice enough to cut them in half so we could swap and taste each.  A little watermelon crazy drink who's name I can't remember and we were all set.  With the music from the down the street going we had a great little lunch.  \\n\\nThe Ducks confit was excellent but the pickled shallots really brought the sandwich together and took it to the next level.  highly recommend.  And I want one right now just thinking about it.  The beef cheeks were super tender and tasted like a pot roast sandwich, only better.  The carrots on this have been pickled as well and add a great dimension to the taste.  They make all these pickles themselves and the care really shows. The rolls they use are excellent and slightly toasted as well, given this not only great tastes but good textures as well.  Works on so many levels.   In my short time in VC this was the best food truck by far for taste.

The location is in the street-side lower level of an apartment/condo complex (covered parking - score!) and the ambiance is pretty industrial. Grays, some wood, interesting lighting and no other decor.  We walked in and were surprised at how small it was.\\n\\nOur waiter was prompt, attentive, but not intrusive and we decided on Chatham Cod Fish and Chips and a Porter Burger that featured Triple Cream Brie.  We had a lovely glass of beer (they have a nice selection of beer on draft!) and waited for our selections.\\n\\nYum.  Seriously, just YUM.  \\n\\nThe Chatham Cod Fish rivaled some we have had in Canada and England, but with a Texas twist that made us total fans. Meyer lemon remoulade! The mashed peas were a sweet little side note, and truly the only part of the dish that wasn't great was the chips.  They were listed as malt chips, but were larger slabs of potato that were cooked well but had little malt flavor to us.\\nBack to the fish.  Impeccably fried cod with a really crispy crust, hot, steaming fish inside and no fishy flavor.  We are fans.\\n\\nThe Porter Burger captured our attention with the promise of triple cream brie and pancetta, and although those were wonderful additions, the real star of this burger was the beef.  Savory, hot and juicy, its flavors melded with the creaminess of the brie, the salty crunch of the kettle chips and the crispy pancetta.  Heavenly.  The bun was just there to hold it all together so I have no comments about it. \\nOn to the fries.  Crispy, salty, and everything you want a fry to be.  This is what should have been with the fish and chips!  We had to sit the plate aside so we wouldn't blow our calorie allotment irreparably.\\n\\nBottom line:  Not the cheapest dinner out there, but well cooked, well presented and the selections were just unique enough to be fun.

Plentiful seafood at very reasonable prices.  We started with the raw bar which had $1 blue point oysters.  These were tasty and a steal on a Saturday!  (Raw bar only 4-7PM)  We also had a really tasty calamari salad from the raw bar which had a great sauce on it.  The calamari serving was large for 5$.  Twin lobster rolls at 25$ provided me a massive amount of lobster in 2 delicious little toasted buttered buns.  These were the perfect classic lobster roll.  Basic and delicious, just the way you would want them.  You really can't do better value wise in the city.  In my opinion the lobster roll is better than island creek's because of the basic roll versus the rosemary one at ICOB.  If you get the twin order here you will also get significantly more lobster.  I had the sweet potato tots which were addictive.  I was full before finishing but could not resist finishing these! My wife had the burger which was just decent in my opinion (nothing could compare to my lobster roll at the time).  \\n\\nAtmosphere is great with the patio available overlooking the charles.  Inside the dining room is modern and just fine.  Service was just average.  The staff is young and doesn't seem to be experienced.  They act like they don't want to be there. The service is not up to par with the food prices.  We did notice a manager walking around and making sure the young staff were doing their job well and that all customers were taken care of.  That was really nice to see.  \\n\\nI will be back when I'm looking for that classic new england lobster roll and a good cheap raw bar to match."},{"name":"Ruby Tuesday","address":"8753 Owenfield Dr","city":"Powell","stars":"2.5","text":"Why are these places in such a big hurry to rush their customers out the door?

I was SUPER excited to get a last minute reservation on a Tuesday night at 8:30pm with my husband. We arrived early for our sitting and waited a couple minutes to be seated. The host and hostess were both very friendly and pleasant. The place was jam packed with people upon arrival and the space is cool, not inexplicably cool but they have done a nice job of creating some character. We were shown to our table and sat for literally 15 minutes!!! No water, just menus. This was the second sitting of the night and it was starting to clear out a bit. We became besties with the table next to us who had been seated around the same time (and by besties I mean bonding over no service). Our flighty aloof waitress finally came over and didn't seem to even get that we were starving and already had a bad taste in our mouth. Overall, service was very poor, which I was semi shocked about given all the press about a \\"dream team\\". The place was pretty empty by the time we left and our total dining experience was an hour and 45 minutes for 4 dishes. \\n\\nFood--honestly, I had extremely high hopes for a place like this that boasts about it's high level of innovation, is responsibly sourcing as many ingredients as they can and treats their staff with a lot of respect but it just didn't deliver. We started with the three onion dip and house-made chips. The onion dip was bold with charred and caramelized onions, however, the chips were soggy and lacked that flash-fried crunch and finishing salt. Additionally we ordered the lamb's neck agnolotti which was the highlight. Neck meat is decadent and delightful and the fresh veggies that accompany this dish were nice. The pork belly dish was so incredibly small it almost made no sense for us to try to split it. The flavors were nice and I'm all for paying for responsibly raised and sourced proteins but the price did not even remotely match the portion. The NY Strip was grilled to perfection--a gorgeous medium rare and the grilled carrots were flavorful and bright. We had every intention of ordering dessert but couldn't stand to wait around for another long period while our waitress literally meandered around the place aimlessly. All dishes were very good but with the amount of hype around this place, it lacked the punch we were looking for. \\n\\nAfter seeing the Food Network highlight, we will probably return with a 5pm reservation for the secret burger and hope for a for a better experience."},{"name":"Dark Horse","address":"2922 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"The go-to place for a cheap, but delicious meal.\\n \\nEver have the issue where you and your friends cannot decide on where to eat for dinner?

Last night was no different and was even an awesome night for it because it was so crisp out that I didn t even break a sweat lol. I was in a nice pair of red biking shirt wearing a black t-shirt with a pair of tennis shoes. I arrived before Matt did and asked the servers out on the patio about tables inside and they said that there were many available tables and it wouldn t be a problem to get seated. Then I went inside and after being ignored for a few minutes the owner approached me with a disdainful look i though only reserved for homeless beggars. When I asked to be seated for two he unapologetically looked at me and told me that the only seats available were at the bar which is secluded all the way at the front of the restaurant on high bar stools. I have a bad lower back and hate bar seats and let him know that my back could not handle the chairs and he just flatly looked at me at said he hoped i had better luck elsewhere and turned and walked away. As i walked out the outdoor waiters asked why I was leaving and when I told them I thought he treated me unfairly because of my attire they said that he is bad for things like that and they apologized for their employers bad behaviour.

Age during this time of the morning is usually 20s and 30s. There may be a cop standing in the front, which is not a good sign. If you don't want to have a night go awry, avoid places where there are cops present, that means the place has a tendency to attract the wrong types of people. Chau Chow does attract gangstas, hoes, and frat boys. The servers aren't fluent in English, so you may have to repeat yourself several times. The last guy gave me an attitude, forgot one of my orders, and don't be surprised if a string of waiters ask you seconds from each other, if you're ready to pay the bill. Another thing, the servers will sometimes do things you won't understand, such as rearranging your empty drinking cups for no reason.\\n\\nThe bottom line is the food, and it's terrible here. The chicken is stuffed with filler, and the taste is very base (think of a pH scale). It's also salty, so get ready to make some bathroom breaks later from all the water you'll drink.

Now, if some people want to jump into the hype, maybe to justify standing in a line for 2-3 hours, that's their inalienable right but it doesn't sound like they've had 2nd place.\\n\\nFor the past 2 years, The Daily Meal has done a little survey called The 101 Best Restaurants in America.

As Aaron sliced off a half inch of brisket, the cut edge leaned toward the block like a wave. Chunks of the pork ribs separated by gravity, when lifted with one hand. They both had as much honest meat flavor as wood smoke can provide. The best? Maybe. Head and shoulders better than 2nd place? No. Worth standing in a 2.5 hour line?

A glass of vodka, a glass of ice, a lime, and a bottle of tonic. Customers have to become their own bartenders to mix the drink. Cumbersome and stupid.\\n\\nWe opted for the 6 course tasting menu- which may be Atlanta's best bargain @ $73.\\nI was surprised to see how many inexpensive wines were on their list. I brought my own bottle of Pahlmeyer for which they charged a $25 corkage fee.\\n\\nShortly after receiving our cocktails they delivered bread- this was the only item we received that wasn't on the tasting menu. No amuses, no compliments of the chef, etc. The bread, in a word, sucked. Limp and void of chew. Like an oversized parker house roll. No butter accompanied it.\\n\\nThe first course, a small beet salad arrived while we were still drinking our cocktails and before our wine was opened and poured. The beets were absent any seasoning. We asked for salt. 3-4 minutes later one of the servers came back to the table with a dish of salt and pepper; along with a teaspoon. I wasn't sure how customers are supposed to manage the process so we went old school and pinched out enough salt to bring the beets to life.\\n\\nThe soup that followed was excellent. Shrimp and corn chowder. The deep fried corn pudding nuggets that came along in a separate dish- were log heavy and not worth a second bite. Although the portion was appropriate for a tasting menu, this is a heavy cream based soup.\\n\\nTrout was next served. Way too much food for a tasting menu. Properly cooked and tender. However, bland and uninteresting.\\n\\nThe next dish was duck. It clearly sat too long in the kitchen under the heat lamps- as the exposed surface had dried out (on both of our plates). The sauce too had nearly evaporated from heat. The portion, again, was way too big for a tasting menu. We sent back the duck. They promptly addressed the issue and offered to replace the duck with quail. We agreed.\\nThe quail was heavily battered/breaded and deep fried. The half bird offered a single bite of meat. Perhaps the heavy handed breading was done so as to make the single bite appear bigger.\\n\\nBeef short rib came next. It was delicious but again, WAY too much food for a tasting menu. I had barely enough room to finish the beef. My guest left half of the meat on the plate. All of the accompanying starch and veg remained uneaten.\\n\\nLastly, a really large and heavy chocolate hockey puck looking thing was served for dessert. We each had a bite and pushed it aside.

It is the typical propane tank design, except it is about double the size of his other two round smokers. I'm guessing it is a 1000 gallon model.

I think they changed that though.\\n\\nThe pizza takes a LONG TIME TO MAKE. Don't expect to be in and out quickly. I love going here, hanging out, chatting, working up an appetite by seeing all the other pizzas, then finally our pizza arrives. A bittersweet wait.

But for a Friday night, we were still able to easily get OT reservation for any time slot and the huge dining space still wasn't at capacity. The menu has completely changed from 2 months ago, so was excited to try more!\\n\\nThe good part of the night is the food. While our last visit had some hits and misses, I would say all of our dishes were quite delicious this time around.\\n- Burrata with beets and proscuitto: 1 of my favorite things to order for appetizer because it's delish and it's so simple it's almost hard to do it wrong if you have fresh ingredients. This was no exception.\\n- Braised short ribs: Pretty tender and was definitely cooked in a nice rich sauce for a while. \\n- Stuffed pumpkin: This dish is huge and hearty. If you're not very hungry, this alone is enough for 2 people. We could fairly finish it despite only having 2 small plates before hand... The pumpkin was very tender, as is the cubed pork shoulder instead. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms and pepitas for added texture.\\n\\nSo if we were to rate Tapestry on the above information alone, it would be a 4 pushing 5. But the service was just painfully painfully slow. It's a big space and can accommodate a lot of guests, and they should staff the tables and the kitchen appropriately. All the tables next to us looked like they waited a lot time as well. At least 20 min between dishes and 20 min waiting for drinks. A dinner consisting of only 3 dishes ended up being 2 hrs long. I can't imagine what it would be like if they ever fill both the front and back rooms... \\n\\nWhile the food has gotten better, the service has deteriorated in its increasing popularity.

I understand that the gratuity options are on the top of the screen when completing the purchase, which is fine, and I think under the right circumstances I may have provided a tip (e.g. staying and eating there, maybe using the WiFi). My problem arises from the fact that the default option for paying (at least when I paid) was the 15% gratuity option, BY DEFAULT (meaning I didn't purposefully select a tip). Because I am unaccustomed to verifying whether or not I am being charged gratuity for every transaction that I participate in, I unknowingly paid for the tip. Literally every restaurant, coffee shop, brewery, etc that I have been to, in recent memory, has the default setting for tips as 0%. This modus operandi makes total sense, if you pay for your goods/service and feel the other party deserves a tip you can choose a value you see fit. What Pica's does is particularly troubling, especially because there is not a wait staff, just simply someone bringing food out to you. It is basically like a glorified chipotle. Really it is not that much different. \\n\\nEven when you have a large party at a restaurant (e.g., a proper restaurant, you know, with a wait staff, someone who seats you, etc) even they typically explicitly say that gratuity will be added for a party of a certain size (usually ~15%). This is fine by me because this is standard practice in the industry. \\n\\nAt your restaurant I was automatically and unknowingly charged a tip (granted I could have specifically selected 0%) for basically the same level of service I receive at the drive through at McDonald's. If I would have paid with cash, do you think it would be ok for your staff to not return all of the change because I didn't explicitly state that I didn't want to provide a tip? \\n\\nMy suggestion is that you do what every other business is doing in this regard. Any default tip value beyond 0% looks beyond shady, deceptive, and greedy. I think you can agree that it is deceptive based on how businesses typically use that electronic pay pad. Please don't give me the, \\"oh well you should have read the pad before signing\\" bit. Come on man... use some common sense.

I cannot speak on behalf of the actual food in the place, but my family and friends have given it a 2 thumbs up.\\n\\nHowever, I go once in a while to their Monday night wings special (review based solely on this) and the place is usually packed. Typically wait can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes depending on what time you go and if there are any good games on. I have never had a bad experience here at Soulfire as the waitstaff are very nice and attentive for the most part, constantly refilling wings and water quickly.  \\n\\nAs for the prices, I have seen them fluctuate over the years. Back then it would only cost about ~$10-11 (including tip) for all you can eat wings (no drink, just water). After a lot of variation in their prices over the years, the price tonight was ~$14 w/ tip (no drink requirement). \\n\\nThe wings were decent sized and they typically offer 4 different flavors of wings every week. From what I have experienced over the years, they keep buffalo and PitBoss (sweet and spicy BBQ) and rotate the other two flavors. Personally, I do not enjoy the buffalo that they have. I don't know what it is about it, but apparently the majority of the people I know do not like their buffalo either. Tonight I had spicy teriyaki, spicy honey, buffalo, and PitBoss. I'm glad they keep PitBoss every week as it is by far my favorite. The waiters do provide you with a side of BBQ sauces, which include SoulFire, Sweet and Spicy, PitBoss, and Fiery. \\n\\nRemember that if you do not like a particular sauce with the initial 4 wing sampler, you can tell them to take out the flavors you do not like! If you don't they will just give you a full platter of all of the flavors. Also, you can order half platters if you're beginning to get full, but still want more wings!\\n\\nI gave it 4 stars because the atmosphere is lacking, it is dark and often very loud...making it hard to hold a conversation without raising my voice.

The bartender Jason learned that it was our anniversary and after asking us a few questions prepared dessert cocktails just for us.  The cherry pie is a must.

The chicken & waffles were excellent. Despite being a born-and-raised Midwestern girl, I consider myself somewhat of an expert on chicken & waffles and these were one of the best versions I've had by far. I was also pleasantly surprised by the sweet potato waffle. I had it by itself and it tasted like pumpkin, which was perfect. My husband's bananas Foster french toast was delicious and not too sweet.

The bartender short guy seemed annoyed when I asked about what juices they had. I told him what I wanted and turned to my friend who doesn't speak English so told me what she wanted in 2 words \\"agua mineral\\". Which means mineral water.  I turned to look at the bartender and tell him what my friend wanted, but he wasn't there any longer.  he I had moved on to take another's order.  Never even made the drink that I ordered.  Being in the industry my self I though ok!  I get it and I didn't take it personally or judge, I figured ok what ever...he continued making drinks, not mine and didn't return to get my friends order.  About 10 minutes whent by \\nAnd our food got delivered that's when the other bartender approached our end of the bar and my friend lifting one finger to get his attention.  This seemed to enrage the bartender telling us \\"I see you\\" in a really demeaning attitude which continued through out our interaction.  I ordered a bottle of pelegrino and a side of juice.  By the time he came back with it which took 1 minute or less the other bartender decided to finally make my drink (soda and juice) about 13 minutes after I ordered it.  They showed contempt that I had ordered a bottle of water which I no longer wanted since I finally had gotten what I had originally ordered.  My friend decided she still wanted the pelegrino so we kept it.  \\n\\nThe bartender (shorty) could not look me in the eyes knowing he had ignored me for a good 10 to 15 mins.  \\n\\nNeither did any of them check on us during the corse of our meal.  The side of juice I had ordered never came, so when I saw the closest bartender I asked him to bring it.  Again he was so rude throwing the juice into to ice bin with force and disdain.  \\n\\nTheir attitude was one of don't waste my time asking about juices.  I don't have time for you and I don't care.  Total confrontation and aggression.  I don't care how good u can shake the mixer if you don't have humility and desire to genuinely serve then you don't belong in the industry.

In fact, I'm not sure why they had different names because the food was exactly the same.  Jumbalaya's had kooky *cajun* decor instead of kooky *mexican* decor, but the menus were identical.\\n\\nMy point is - even though I came home smelling like fajita seasoning every night, I looooved the food at Jumbalaya's, never got sick of it, and am so happy to work near a restaurant that serves the same grub.\\n\\nI know this is a chain, but it's a small chain of six.  I feel like at Chili's and similar, the decor is picked out by faceless corporate lackeys, coldly calculating the kookiness factor of a horse saddle or cowpoke.  Whereas the Border Cafe feels like the owners got together, had a bunch of margaritas and make a list: christmas lights?  Yes!  Gaucho attire on the walls?  Yes!  Sombreros galore?  Si! Si! Si!\\n\\nThe service is always stellar--no matter how busy it is, the staff are unflappable.  Overall it makes for a cheerfully rowdy atmosphere, where no one is afraid to go overboard with their margarita intake...and those babies go down easy, going perfectly with the fresh, tasty, and complimentary tortilla chips.

As main course I ordered the fusion bento box; Sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, more undercooked edamame, a tiny slider, and a 4 piece roll \\"the firecracker\\", good size but flavorless. I guess for $16 I cannot complain much. My boyfriend ordered the $25 nigiri-sashimi combo. Sushi had a good size and it was good quality fish.

We were lucky that a group was just leaving a spot in the outdoor enclosed area and we snagged up a table for four people. On a Friday night, this place must the pre-drink party place because there was a lot of rowdy people here, so much that someone even puked outside of the female washroom. Yuck. And it wasn't even that late - the night was just beginning! So keep in mind if you're looking for a chill place, this is not where you should go. \\n\\nIn terms of service, it took a bit of effort to wave down someone's attention to order food - seems like people are in a daze here or something. Service here is mixed at best. I do understand that this place is pretty busy but if you are seating people outside there should be more of a conscious effort to serve us. This is especially true when you factor in all the prices. We ended up ordering a yogurt soju, a pitcher of Sapporo, the soy chicken and dukbokki. The drinks were pretty overpriced and the dukbokki was too chewy and in a pretty watery sauce. The soy chicken on the other hand was REALLY good. But again it was not cheap either. Being in a group the price shared by four people was about $20 with tax and tip so it was alright but the meal wasn't very filling.\\n\\nOverall, I think there's a lot of hype with Zabu. I've heard from Korean friends the mixed service from the establishment and the treatment of workers - and it clearly shows as the service from staff here is mixed as well. If it weren't others who wanted to go here, I'd probably not go to Zabu due to their inconsistency, but as a packed place on a Friday night I can't really argue with this model as something must be right..."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've eaten here twice.

You don't really get a full on interaction from an actual server. They literally just serve the food to you, so I wound assume no need to tip lol. \\n\\nFOOD: The Tonkatsu noodle was small noodles.. I prefer thicker noodles. The soup was too liquidy, not thick at all. The appetizers weren't good :/ but I really liked my boyfriends noodle dish, the tsukemen.. That one has thick noodles so I basically ended up stealing his noodles and gave him all mine. Also, they season their egg with sousauce so it is a little sweet and salty when you bite into it. Some people, like my boyfriend, really enjoy this.. But it wasn't that great. I'd rather have the traditional egg. Lastly, I didn't enjoy the green tea pudding thing, other then the crumbly stuff on top. \\n\\nAMBIANCE: I enjoyed the art work of the place and it has really loud music so the vibe is on point. \\n\\nOVERALL, I wish I could have enjoyed it like most people..

It's about $120 ($20/lb, so the same price as waiting in line) but you get a full 5-7 lb brisket in a vacuum sealed bag that you can reheat at home either in a cooler of hot water (or sous vide it) or in your oven.

The patio is large and I really like to dine outside. So how come I won't go back?\\nWe had reservations and arrived prior to the doors opening. We were seated right away. The server was nice but seemed to be rushed which seemed odd considering there was only one other party who also had reservations.\\nThe food was lackluster, it's overpriced and the server who was quite nice, had a way of suggesting add-ons as if they were choices included in the price of the item. It's hard to explain but 4 of my friends were surprised that they were charged for something that they thought was included with their meals. Each one indicated that it was the way in which the server asked them about their order. Since my visit I've heard several other people who said the same thing happened to them. \\nBottom line: I find that there are too many other places I'd rather go that have much better food for the same price and don't seem to trick people into additional items.

You ask me how waiting in line (or tailgating) to eat 3-4 hours is amazing?    I commute to work 3-4 hours per day, so hanging out here, making new friends and enjoying great food is completely worth it to me.   Got in line today around 1015am and sat down to eat at 145pmish.     The hanging out while getting in is actually even better than the food itself - that is if you love meeting cool new people.   You spend all this time in line together so don't be surprised if you're hugging after you're done eating.  The sit down tables are somewhat communal, and one of the guys at our table was celebrating a birthday.  That's all we had to find out and we got the whole place to sing to him.    \\n\\nNow do some people give up on the line and leave?  Of course, this isn't for everyone. But why not just have a great time at this famous place and see what the fuss is about?     They come around and sell drinks while you're waiting and also brought us samples of pulled pork sandwiches.    They also come out and get an idea of what you want so they make sure they have enough - although once they're out, they close.   Hours are 11am-3pm.  You could show up at 2 and risk it, perhaps on a Tues or Wed that might work.   Today being a Friday it was packed.   Brisket is amazing (perfection) - nice and crispy and some fat on the edges which I loved.    Also enjoyed the pulled pork.  I tried the sausage because it looked like kielbasa, but it wasn't my thing.  One of the friends I made in line who was a big cook/bbq expert thought the ribs were the best.    I tried the potato salad as a side and it overwhelmingly tasted like potatoes and mustard (whereas I like my potato salad with eggs).   I wasn't going to get any dessert but they have these mini pies (lemon chess, pecan, key lime and banana) so I tried the lemon chess.   It was delicious (and I am not a pie person at all) and apparently all the pies are made from scratch same day.  \\n\\nWhat else can I say?    Well I was surprised at how much fun it was coming here.

The crab flavor is intense and memorable, and you can also order a larger bowl if you'd like more crabby love.  Don't waste any of the soup - use some of the homemade corn bread to soak up the goodness.\\n\\nI finished my decadent meal with the star of the evening, the shrimp and grits.  The grits are soooo good - warm and creamy with a nice texture.  The shrimp is always perfectly cooked and has a nice crisp bite to it - you get six or seven tasty shrimp with an order - after cooking, they look to be around U 12-16 size - big and plump. The sauce its served in is rich and flavorful and has a subtle spiciness from the saut√©ed poblano peppers.  It's not too spicy, but the poblanos add depth and complexity to the already delicious sauce.  \\n\\nI didn't have any dessert this time - just too stuffed to order anything - but can't wait until my next visit to the \\"A\\" and South City!\\n\\nOh, and forgot to mention the staff - always warm and inviting - I always feel like a friend of the restaurant, not just a table to turn and burn.

When we first arrived I gave my name and stated we had a reservation and the hostess told her colleague our name and our reservation time.  The second hostess looked up and asked very rudely our name, I repeated our name and reservation information and she dismissively told us to follow a third hostess.  We were seated in a section that didn't look too busy. Five minutes passed before we were ever greeted or acknowledged by our server. When he did come he asked our drink order and left before we could order appetizers or ask any questions. When I asked for suggestions on a cocktail he seemed uninterested and almost like he didn't know anything about them. We finally got drinks and appetizers, and eventually our entrees, but the entire process was slow and ridiculous. The table behind us came in way after us but continued to get everything before us - we had the same number of people so I can only assume it was the server. When our food arrived it was another 15 minutes before our server asked how our food was or checked if we needed anything since he wasn't the one who brought our entrees. I asked for a refill and assumed my husband would also get one since he has had even less than me to drink, but I was wrong - he looked at both drinks and only refilled mine. It seemed that every time we needed something our server was gone or talking to the other servers in the corner. He never checked in or did a good job making sure we had refills or that our dining experience. Sadly I could have overlooked the awful service if the food had been worth it but I've had better burgers and personally think this place is not worth a stop. You pay way more for the hype than for good quality food. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else - personally I think the drinks and burgers are way better at Margaritaville.

Meat was well marinated and tasted very good to me. My wife tried their chicken fajitas.

Perhaps due to the B&Bs recent opening, it can be hard to get a reservation on a Friday or Saturday. If reserving with Open Table, do so earlier in the week. Pretty nice decor and there's a dining area with comfy chairs and mood lighting that is unique and fun. The menu is tapas and they bring out your dishes as they're ready, not all at once. The service was really quick. We had our food within minutes although it wasn't piping hot. I presume, they pre-prepare the dishes and serve them to order. We ordered the mac n cheese, blackened shrimp guacamole, honey biscuits, chicken wings, and beignets.  The mac n cheese was pretty good although it tasted instant. I expected it to be creamy and rich; however, the noodles were over cooked and the sauce was pretty thin. The hot cheeto toppers were an interesting addition but didn't add much to the dish aside from texture.  The blackened shrimp guacamole was tasty; however, it seems the addition of popcorn shrimp on top of the guacamole, was an after thought. Again, not sure it was needed or added much to the dish. The honey biscuits and beignets were very tasty. Both were served fresh and hot. We enjoyed the pimento and honey butter spreads that came with the biscuits.  The chicken wings were tasty also although you may want to ask them to be prepared crispy because ours were pretty soggy. We really enjoyed the blue cheese accompaniment to them however.  Finally, the frozen grenade is a tasty drink but really sweet. Overall, we had a pretty good experience. We didn't have to wait upon arrival, our reservation was honored. There's plenty of on street parking on Dartmouth.  The ambiance was nice and the service was quick. The food wasn't bad but wasn't special as we'd expected.

Better hummus than I've ever had anywhere and the falafel were perfectly sized, moist and well seasoned.\\n\\nOnly complaint - it was *cold* in there.

We were all starving and eager to see what the fuss was all about. \\n\\n// FOOD //\\nScreen Door Praline Bacon: Smoked bacon caramelized with toasted pralines, brown sugar, and hint of cayenne. They definitely put enough crushed pralines on the bacon. I can't say that I really tasted the cayenne at all. They put plenty of brown sugar on top too is the bacon is pretty sweet. It goes well with a cup of black coffee. 3/5\\n\\nFried Chicken & Waffle: Screen Door's famous buttermilk battered fried chicken and sweet potato waffle. (Choice of 1, 2, or 3 pieces of chicken). We went with the 3 pieces of chicken. I highly suggest you do not order the 3 piece if you are eating this on your own. The pieces of chicken are large and heavy! It was nice how they did not include the bones. The fried chicken had a little kick to it and the chicken itself was moist and tender. Unfortunately, the sweet potato waffle wasn't anything to write home about. 4/5\\n\\nLowcountry Breakfast Shrimp & Grits: Four jumbo shrimp saut√©ed with bacon, garlic, and tomato served over cheddar grits with 2 eggs and a buttermilk biscuit on the side. How can you go wrong with ordering shrimps over some cheesy grits and a couple over easy eggs on the side? I just placed the eggs on top and let the yolk run over the top of the shrimp and grits.

Don't go if you can't wait, both for a table, service, and the food. Nothing is speedy at this restaurant. Also know that whatever time estimate they give you when your put your name down is likely to be underestimating the actual wait.

When Screen Door says an hour and a half, we know it's more likely to be 2 hours. \\n\\nWe've been twice for dinner so far -- once at 8:00pm on a Saturday night and we waited until 9:45pm until we were seated.

After our order was dropped off, we only saw our server once more before we asked for the bill. We waited for our water to be refilled. When I asked for to go containers, he brought me 4 containers but only 3 lids. I needed 5 containers and 5 lids. He didn't bring me a bag. I asked 1) for the containers, 2) for an extra lid and an extra set of container + lids, and 3) for the bag. The last time, I got up and went over to the service area because I didn't want to wait 10 minutes for our server to meander back to our table and I got chastised a little for getting up.

They are very rude. We arrived as a walk-in around 11:30pm on a Saturday. The dining area was about 50% empty with lots of large group tables and 4-6 person tables available. I came in with a group of 5. Two of us went straight to the bar to order drinks, one went to the candy shop and the other two went to go sit down at an empty table. They were immediately approached by a hostess who kicked them out of the table and told them they needed to get put on the waiting list. For what? Empty tables? There were plenty of servers working and some who were just standing around so we were not sure why there was a 20-minute wait time. After I got my drink at the bar, I asked one of the servers if we could sit at one of those empty tables near the bar that looked like first-come first-serve tables, and he said sure! So my husband and I sat while we waited for our other 2 friends to grab drinks at the bar and no more than 5 minutes later we too got kicked out of the table. We explained that we asked if we could sit there and that one of the servers said yes but the hostess said no, you can't you have to put your name down which we then replied we had and we were waiting. When our buzzer went off and we went back to the hostess stand, three of the hostesses just stood there talking to each other and ignoring the fact that we were right there in front of them until my friend waved her hand in front of their faces. Their attitudes were just horrible.\\n\\n5 stars for the British long-haired bartender. My husband and I ordered to Makers Mark with a splash of coke.

It was a Sunday night in early August.  Luckily the rain stopped about 30 minutes prior, so we were able to eat out on the patio.  The restaurant was nearly empty at this time.  Earlier in the day and the next morning, we saw many families eating breakfast there, which looked great.  The friendly hostess greeted us right away and took us to a table on the patio overlooking the Charles River.  She gave the kids children's menus and clay to keep them occupied.  I loved this!  The kids had a great time making the items shown on the menu throughout our entire meal.\\n\\nI was glad we had good weather and could eat outside.  Always a plus with kids!   The view from the patio of the river and Boston was great.  The interior of the restaurant was a little dark at night, but looked nice during the day when the sunlight was shining in the windows.\\n\\nOur waiter was courteous and knowledgeable about the menu.  I was torn between a few items and he described each one in detail for me, so I was able to decide.  He recommended the Art Burger, but I had just eaten a burger for lunch, so I didn't go with his suggestion.  We ordered a bottle of wine off of their extensive wine list, as well as appetizers to start.  Both were served quickly.\\n\\nThe children's meals include an appetizer, entr√©e, drink and dessert for $8.95.  Both of my kids ordered the fruit salad appetizer, which was good.  My son ordered chicken fingers and my daughter had pasta with marinara sauce.  The chicken was good, but my daughter didn't like the pasta.  When the waiter cleared the plates after the meal, he made a comment about her not eating it and she said it wasn't good.  He didn't offer to replace it with anything else, just ignored the comment.  As previously mentioned, the meal was supposed to come with dessert, but the waiter didn't ask if they wanted dessert and we forgot that it was included.\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the Shrimp Cocktail.  This was the best part of the meal for me.  There were 5 or 6 huge shrimp with a delicious cocktail sauce.  My husband ordered the Grilled Sirloin, which he said was good.  I ended up ordering the Lobster Risotto.  There where large pieces of lobster, which were great, but the Risotto wasn't cooked well.  For dessert my husband had the chocolate layer cake which he loved.  I ordered the baked banana wontons.  They were not what I was expecting.  The outside was not crisp, but actually very chewy.  I didn't eat them.\\nThe prices are high, but I believe they are average for that type of restaurant in that area.  The total for the meal, including tip was a little over $200.00.  I expect a higher quality meal for that price.  If I was staying at the hotel during the spring or summer months, I would probably eat there again, mostly for the view and the clay for the kids.  Next time, however, I will order the ArtBar Burger, as recommended by the waiter.\\n\\nThis review is based on a complimentary dinner at the ArtBar.  I received no other compensation and the opinions are entirely my own."},{"name":"The Cruise In Diner","address":"7731 NE 33rd Dr","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good portions Great food lots of odd.

I will admit I maybe nitpicking here but I didn't get a choice of waters and I certainly didn't get the level of engagement that they got.

Treat Franklin BBQ as an experience, not a restaurant. You will be in line for at least 3 hours. If done right, your time in the queue (food pun) will be very enjoyable.\\n\\n2.) Make new friends while you wait. Bust out a deck of cards. Just don't forget the lawn chairs.\\n\\n3.) It's BYOB outside. Bring a 6-pack, preferably a mix-and-match of Texas craft beer.\\n\\n4.) Brisket and sausage are Texas BBQ staples, but don't skip out on the butter-bathed turkey. After they slice it, they throw it right back in the vat of butter where it was staying warm, and if you have the self-control to keep your tongue in your mouth after you see that, you've defeated Franklin's...but you probably won't.\\n\\n5.) The moist brisket dissolves the second it hits your tongue. It's incredible. It is the best brisket in the world. Buy it. Enjoy it.

For $7, they came out with a huge portion of fried pickles that were hot, crispy and delicious. For our main course, we opted to get the everything plate so we could try a variety of four meats. We got the sliced beef brisket, wings, ribs and pulled pork. I don't really know how to feel about the everything place because I LOVED the wings and the rings (they were so juicy and flavorful) but I wasn't a big fan of their brisket or pulled pork.

You may wonder, what magnificent culinary muse would inspire one to delve into the twisted world of food literature? The answer is Franklin Barbecue. In parallel with the finest 'cue in the world, Franklin is homegrown and simple, operating out a trailer. In fact, the smoker is as big as the trailer in which the food is served. Clean picnic benches overlook 'ol IH-35. Traditionally, Texas barbecue is heavily weighted towards meat, in that a meat should be able to stand on it's own without the embellishments of sauce or sides. I have had the pleasure of sampling all the meats produced by Franklin, and I can confidently say that Franklin lives up to that proud Texas barbecue tradition. I dare say that Franklin is up to par with the legendary old time barbecue of Lockhart or Luling. The brisket is tender and juicy, and the bark will make you happy to be alive. No liquid smoke, real smoke. The sausage is also quite exquisite. Slightly spicy, it is reminiscent of the Lockhart-style sausage. The pulled pork is somewhat of an oddity to see in central Texas, but tasting it at Franklin makes me wonder where the hell it's been for so long. It comes with a thin vinegar-based sauce made just for it, and it pairs excellently. Given the quality hitherto discussed meats, you can imagine how the ribs tasted: incredible - meat easily slide off the bone, perfectly pre-sauced. Franklin makes three sauces, all of which work with all the meats. The pork sauce is supposed to go with the pork, as its name implies, but I found it works well with all the meats. There is espresso sauce which is like no BBQ sauce I've ever tasted: dark, not oversweet, seductive. I believe it worked best with the brisket. Then there was the house sauce, which, if there was a classic TX bbq sauce taste, this sauce would embody that taste.\\nThe only sides I have tried are the beans, cole slaw, and potato salad. They are not as innovative as the sides at the Salt Lick, but all of them are superior when compared to places like Pok-e-Jo's or Ironworks. The Cole Slaw is not doused in mayo, and the tater salad is mustard-based. Both of these qualities make me happy.\\nSo there you have it. The place is just north of downtown, so it is much easier to get to than Lockhart. Thus, I will be eating at this place at least 20 times a week.

Cort choose the Dougs Filet, Amy chose the Spicy tuna roll, and chose the Blackened Tuna Nachos.  The Dougs Filet was by far my favorite.  Cort and Amy loved the Tuna Nachos.  I saw a dish go by that had potatoe straws that looked really good.. The server said it was the Hillbilly dish.  Next time...  The prices were reasonable, but I felt dishes were not very filling.\\nFood: 4.0 Stars\\nServer: 4.5\\nAmbiance:4.5\\nValue: 3.0"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Oh Border, how I love thee. Probably the best Mexican food in Harvard Square. As soon as you are seated, you are greeted with a basket of fresh, hot tortilla chips that were literally just scooped out of the fryer, and a bowl of salsa. The tortilla chips are lightly salted and pair perfectly with a margarita. Speaking of the margaritas - definitely get one. They are strong, cheap, and delicious! I like the frozen ones that come almost like a slushie. There are different flavors as well.\\n\\nThe entrees are large and delicious. My favorites are either the beef burro or beef enchiladas. The beef is very tender, flavorful, and juicy, and I like it better than the chicken. Both dishes come covered in melted cheese (mm... Heaven). You also have the choice of adding jambalaya on the side for free. \\n\\nI come here whenever I have a craving for Mexican. Be careful though as on Friday and Saturday nights the place gets packed and there is always a wait, so get there early!"},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"You would think with all the celebrity endorsements, Sugar Factory would step up their game. Went today with the family and was GREATLY disappointed. Like 1 star is being super nice here. If Yelp let you give a negative star this place would receive negative times infinity. \\n\\nUpon walking in, hostess was rude. Not welcoming at all. I've said this once and I'll say it again, if you are in a customer service type profession and you are not that personable, maybe you should rethink where you work. If you are miserable at least pretend to but fucking rainbow bright and love your damn job until you can find something better. \\n\\nWith appearance and all, this place seems very dirty. I mean with it being in a high tourist spot, you would think the crew would at least look like they care about their own appearance. Hair, clothes, just everything seems under par.  This place is NOT what it is like in pictures. The marketing person really needs to rethink this. \\n\\nWaitress - who?!? Never got her name. Had to find another waitress to find her to have her cancel our orders... I would say the nicest thing she did was bring out waters for everyone without asking... Thanks waitress!\\n\\nOrder food but ultimately cancelled because of how long it took: 20-30 minutes.  In all this place is just bad. Like me writing this doesn't even put the point through... NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL... Not even for a pre-game. Glorified koolaide - drinks didn't even compare to the pics. \\n\\nI will leave with this... You can wrap shit in gold foil but guess what you still have... Gold foiled shit which is exactly what this place is!"},{"name":"SOJUba","address":"1265 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Service - you have to be patient if it's on weekend. However- They should check on customers at least once after the food is served. \\nEnvironment - can be intimidating due to the dimmed lights and young hip hop music. I sat in the patio so it was nice. \\nFood portion- decent and plenty for 1 person. I ordered the recommended dish. Stone pot rice bowl w spicy pork and a side of Kimchee. I really like it. Food stayed hot for a long time.\\nFood quality- good \\nPrices- $14 base + $3 pork and $3 kimchee"},{"name":"Freebirds World Burrito","address":"1100 Center Ridge Dr Blgd 3, Ste 380","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered 3 meals online  for a certain time.

We always sit at the bar and eat there.\\n\\nThey have some amazing beer on tap! My favorite is the Kentucky Bourbon Ale! On tap it tastes like sugared macaroons -- yum!  I also like a beer they have Ommegang Rustica. They have Duvel in bottles too -- love those Belgian ales. Their beer menu is changing each time I go in, so I know I can always try something new.\\n\\nI've had many great dinners here from the cheaper lighter fare like a strawberry salad and mussels from the app menu to the full on, $30 prime rib crusted in raspberry jelly with garlic, gruyere mash taters. All these meals have been wonderful. They have a lot of elegant specials that rotate regularly and always come out hot.\\n\\nStaff here is also nice and friendly and helpful with food choices. I know some of the them worked over at Greenland Cafe in Salem, another great restaurant but now shut down."},{"name":"Oracle Coffee Company","address":"3875 Sw Bond Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Yummy coffee within walking distance of Rivers Edge hotel, open on weekends.

You'll pay for high quality but I appreciate that this vendor offers \\"speciality\\" products. Products are nicely displayed and the menu is easy to read and understand.\\n\\nTheir coffee doesn't disappoint coffee snobs and the breakfast sandwiches are a value for airport food. Bonus; they offer some Iggy's Bakery products."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent place for brunch if you don't mind the walk... it's kinda far from the rest of the South End scene. \\n\\nHighlights\\n[1] Prix fixe meals aka 'Brunch fiesta specials' - Saturday 10 am to 3:30 pm & Sunday 9 am to 11:30 am. Generous portion of fruit/granola/plantains with an even more generous main course (scrambled eggs, huevos rancheros, eggs benedict, chocolate chip pancakes) for eight bucks. You read that right, EIGHT BUCKS! This is definitely the least expensive of the already inexpensive prix fixe brunch specials in the South End (comparing it to Aquitaine, Gaslight). \\n[2] Assortment of cornbread with special butters and spreads. Combo of yellow and blue cornbreads is pleasing to the eye, and the spreads are pleasing to the taste buds. Very fresh and soft! \\n[3] Cool indoor digs. It's got a real nice feel, with fancy tablecloths and glassware. Nice light fixtures and wall ornamentation.

You can get a variety of noodle soups for around $6! The cashier who I suspect is also the owner was very pleasant and helped me with payment too because I was having trouble with Canadian money as I live in the US. The food came out really quick and it was delicious! Noodles weren't too soggy but still had the type of softness that I wanted. And although the beef was way more tender than I was used to everything tasted great and the broth was perfect!"},{"name":"la vita pizza & pasta","address":"1155 Virginia Ave, Ste F","city":"Hapeville","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was pretty good but the service was horrible.  We ordered 2 pasta dishes with side salads and a 10 inch pizza.  They pizza was first out and was really good.  We asked about the salads and the pasta and they seem to have lost our order.  They ended up bringing one pasta dish after another 20 min and It still took them 10 min to get the salad out after we asked again for them.  Then we had to ask 2 more times for he last pasta.  The table next to us got this pizza first and had to wait 20 min for a caprese salad!  And yet another thanks was waiting on pasta and side salads and I over heard them say they waited over an hour to get their food.  The guy behind me is in the same situation."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The best chicken and waffles I've had in Atlanta.
