There is something for everyone, including those that are not sushi fans. The highlight for me in terms of sushi was the sashimi selection. I dont like to fill up on rice from rolls too quickly, so I appreciated getting to load up on fish before hitting the roll area. My favorite cooked item was the salmon neck. Yes, it might sound strange to some, but it was basically like the cheek of the salmon (aka...super flavorful and melt in your mouth). For dessert there is soft serve, pastries, and even a crepe station. The best part was the green tea soft serve! You cant find that just anywhere.

Also, be ready to wait an eternity for a table.  If you plan far enough head, this is a great place for pre and post game drinks, and they do have decent food as well.My GF and I were here yesterday about 2 hours prior to the game, it was a cluster, well you know..  I was not surprised though, I know the deal going on here, no matter the time of the game, give yourself 3-3.5 hours if you want to enjoy your time here, we didn't allow that.  The hostess stand was covered by four employees, and at that, they were clearly overwhelmed.  We gave them a credit card in order to secure the \\"buzzer\\" to let you know when you table is ready (never heard of that before) but anyway..  Was a 45-50 minute wait which would be cutting it close to game time..  I tried to make my way to the bar, my GF went out on a recon mission to see if Game On or Beer Works had shorter wait times..  Took me about 15 minutes to get a beer, constantly being bumped and spilled on, it really was a mess.. My GF texted me that she found two bar seats at Game On, trying to get to the to get my card back, disaster! took me about 10 minutes to get to the stand, when I did get there the girls clearly had no idea what was going on.However, about 90 minutes AFTER the game we went back and it was pretty empty.  We pulled right up to the bar, service was attentive and efficient.  We ordered bones less barbecue tenders which were delicious..  Our beers were always full, excellent service.  BUT, my girlfriend is looking over my shoulder and says..  \\" Don't those two people next to us have your credit card\\"?  They DID! as well as our bill.  Both of them were so intoxicated they did not even realize that it was both of our bills together and he almost took my card!  We got the card back, we laughed about it, got the bartender who straightened it out but how do you manage that one?  That could have been a huge disaster..I like the Cask, but again, at your own peril, make sure you leave enough time to be seated at the bar, this is on game days/nights, if not, you will not be writing good reviews.Below based on 5 starsSERVICE               ***\\nFOOD                    ***\\nLOCATION            ****\\nATMOSPHERE     ****\\nRESTROOMS       **\\nOVERALL             ***"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"As part of our Portland vacation, we decided to try this place as it came so highly recommended by several people. Although, this was on the other side of town,I'm so glad we made the trek across the river. We came about an hour before it closed and the place was packed. Luckily, we were a party of two and were completely fine to sit at the bar. We talked to the bartender and he was extremely friendly and gave us great recommendations on their food. We ordered the Kai Yaang (charcoal roasted hen with lemongrass),  Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, and the Muu Paa Kham Waan (Boar collar meat served with chilled mustard greens). First off, Thai food is really flavorful. Second, most Thai dishes are spicy. Now, if you can't handle either, you really shouldn't be eating most of the things here. My favorite dish was definitely the Muu Paa Kham Waan. It was pretty darn spicy, but so good at the same time. I mean, they serve it with chilled mustard greens. That's how spicy it is. You need that iced veggie to calm your taste buds down. Their fish sauce wings came in a very close second. It's their most well known dish and there's definitely an explosion of spices in your mouth when eating this. I'd definitely recommend it. The Kai Yaang was definitely a much needed entree to give our taste buds a much needed break from the flavor. The Kai Yaang definitely had a more neutral taste to it and paired with the rice, it was a great meal. I'd definitely recommend anyone, tourist or native, to come here. This place seriously inspired us to visit Thailand, which we will actually be doing later this year.

It's now been over a month since I've been here (almost two), and as someone obsessed with books, it's a little embarrassing that this review didn't come earlier. I really really meant to make a day out of this place. I felt like that's what it deserved, so that's what it would get. However, I was walking around downtown on the quest for food and I saw it. So of course I had to go in. And I spent two glorious hours here, but then my body was beating me up in hunger, so I had to leave early.I imagine I can't say anything at all that hasn't been said by someone else. This place is huge; it's cavernous, it's hungry. Once you enter, you're stuck in the maw of a beast with a full belly, who would be perfectly content to let you slowly digest. And guess what? You'd love it.Of course, I'm speaking about any good ole book lover. Don't come here if you can't respect the written word. I mean, it's an institution, yeah, but if you can't appreciate, you gotta depreciate... on outta here.

Has ANYTHING you could ask for.\\n-You get your very own map (here's to you, fellow tourists). And yeah, you really do need it.\\n-Great vintage cookbook section! Found some things from the 20s and 60s.\\n-Smells like old books and coffee. Two of the most amazing smells on this earth.\\n-Not only will you find the traditional booky books here, but they also have a pretty good selection of graphic novel. (though, honestly I didn't find any of the 5 graphic novels I was looking for)\\n-You would think that a store this would deal with a lot of misplaced books. Pretty good organization, in my opinion.CONS:\\n-I only spent two hours here. I can tell you right now: that was not enough time.\\n-People that work here seemed sparse. I had questions, but had to figure most of them out on my own.\\n-It's not a discount bookstore, with Goodwill prices. Most books are roughly half off, (or priced appropriately, depending on age or rarity).\\n-Can be a little overwhelming. This is coming from someone who, when moving things into storage, had TEN... TEN! Boxes full of books. (for one person, I mean I think that's a lot?)THE VERDICT:\\nI mean, this place is wonderful, splendiferous, huge, and you very may well lose your mind here, for just a few moments. It's hard to process the sheer magnitude of everything this bookstore has to offer. Maybe it doesn't have every single book on your list, but I'm sure it'll have a good chunk of them. Prices are decent, but I wouldn't necessarily say you're getting an amazing deal on everything you purchase. Just use your brain and figure out how much you want to budget before coming here, because otherwise you may end up spending a ton of money.

Good one.Oh, and no more discount pricing on game nights.---\\nI'm in the \\"Meh\\" camp.  It's a handsome room with lots of booths (some tables), and a great, polished stone bar.  The place has a very suburban strip mall gesalt, which I guess makes sense since this is their only in-town location, the others being Hingham, North Andover, South Windson CT and, hello, Virginia Beach.I've had lunch at the Fenway Burton's four times, and each time it's been... adequate.  Not awful, but undistinguished in the food dept, portions a bit skimpy, apps, sandwiches and salads over-priced by $2-4 a plate.  I don't drink and am not gluten-sensitive, so I'll take others' words on those subjects.  Note the above comments about the \\"foreground\\" music and patio dining amid the racket and fumes of Boylston St.Apparently the Fenway Burton's has an unadvertised special \\"buy one entree, get one free\\" _during_ (not before or after) Red Sox home games.  That might be a good time to check it out, especially if you're into steak and martinis.

It's also not cheap... That being said, all of the seafood is so fresh. Huge raw bar selection. Best thing on the menu are the oyster sliders, absolutely amazing.

I had a really good visit and will probably visit again, though not in regular rotation. Let's talk food and drink, shall we?Both of my meal companions got chicken-fried steak. They both say that the breading could have used more defined seasoning. The meat, however, was fresh, probably a hand-pounded sirloin. They also said that the gravy was not seasoned to their liking. Fried potatoes came with the chicken-fried steak. They were uniform, piping hot and terrifically golden brown.Eggs: My chicken tinga came with sunny-side up, which were perfect. Medium eggs with one chicken fried steak were perfect. Over hard came to the table completely overdone, crusty on the outside.Chicken Tinga was a chicken, salsa, and cheese dish topped with two eggs sunny-side up and layered on a handmade sope. The sope was excellent! The chicken was locally sourced and arrived at the table piping hot. I would get this again and probably ask for an extra sope.Pancakes: The buttermilk pancake batter was delicious, and probably the best part of our meal. My dinner mates tried all three syrups, preferring the house-blended apple over the other two. We used two orders of batter to make about 3 thin pancakes for each of us. A bonus is that our waiter gave us very clear and helpful instruction about the griddle.Red Slappy: The house's version of a Bloody Mary. ($1 more for a crispy strip of bacon floating in the spicy mix.) The drink list boasts a lot of Oregon liquors, New Deal vodka in this instance. I liked the spiciness of the Bloody Mary mix because who wants a boring Bloody Mary, but I enjoyed it even more when my waiter brought me extra tomato juice. The drink was $7. Extras: Beautiful, clean decor, a four-panel triptych of pancakes, really good service--attentive and thoughtful. Certainly the food is high-quality. Increased affordability would be a plus.

Sandwiches are pricey but if you are big on quality you will soon realize Sam's obliterates any competition in the area.  And call me crazy but there is something about their potato salad that will make you pity all other attempts at the popular luncheon side dish. I am not gonna run down a long list of the awesome sandwiches I had here because I have only had one.  I got the pastrami and corned beef combo and added some melted swiss, thousand, island, and slaw for a whopping $11.  My improvised reuben was big, meaty, and extremely badass.  In no way is this thing healthy but it sure was tasty and lasted me two meals.  So think of it more like two $6 sandwiches which is way more reasonable. I feel as though Sam's falls somewhere between the quality of Stage Deli and Katz's Deli in NYC.

For the first, my friend and I were celebrating our birthdays with dinner at Morton's followed by a show at the Keller (Caberet, excellent!) This night was a hit and miss. - We split the salad that was on the special menu - burrata cheese, greens and mango - all things I love, but there was hardly any dressing so it was bland. We were tight on time so we just ate as is.  \\n- The bread they serve before the meal is the absolute best ever! It's very egg-ey (is that a word?), crunchy outside and light inside, covered in bits of fried onion and sesame seeds. Tastes like an everything bagel but so much lighter.  Love! With whipped butter, it's heaven. Had to really control myself. Other reviewers mention an onion jam; they didn't give us that either time and I am seriously bummed! \\n- My friend ordered the King Crab with a side of a baked potato, loaded. The crab legs were huge, plentiful and perfectly cooked. They bring the sides for the baked potato to the table so you can choose what and how much you would like. She loved her meal.\\n- I ordered the New York Strip off the special menu, medium. The meat was medium-well and very dry.  I was surprised. Didn't say anything because we were on a very tight schedule. \\n- Creamed spinach was a total miss, no flavor at all, a disappointment\\n- For our birthdays, they gave us a complimentary souffl√©, we did one chocolate, one lemon. Good, but nothing special\\n- Service was fantastic, attentive but not intrusive. Took a picture of our celebration and gave us actual photos, remember them? The server was gracious and took a pic of us with my smartphone as well.\\n- They bagged up my food and kept it in their refridgerator while we were at the theatre and I picked it up after the show. Now that is service! Sadly, the steak and spinach were no better the second night so didn't eat it. Dinner number two was three weeks later for a major celebration. This night totally made up for the first dinner!  Shane was our server and he was top notch all the way! He helped us select cocktails and a wonderful Cab Franc to compliment our meal. - Tomatoes with blue cheese - simple and delicious. Fresh Beefsteak tomatoes and creamy blue cheese. Nothing else needed!\\n- I was determined to make the salad with burrata cheese, mango and greens work, so ordered it with extra dressing on the side. This time it was delicious! The citrus dressing added just the right freshness to this lite salad \\n- My friend had the prime rib on the bone, rare. It came to the table sizzling on the outside and perfectly rare inside. \\n- I had the Porterhouse and stressed medium. This time, it was cooked to perfection served with the filet side cut and separate since this piece of meat cooks faster. I took the rest home and had it the next two days, and even after reheating, it was melt in the mouth delicious\\n- We split a baked potato and the summer corn, which was fresh and so tasty\\n- After dinner drinks completed the mealI told Shane how much I loved the bread and would come back just for that. When he brought us our take-home bags, they felt heavy; he had included a round of bread in each of our bags! Heaven!!! Thank you, Shane!This night the dinner was absolutely stellar from cocktails, bread, salads, steak, sides and dessert matched by impeccable service.

This is a legit good Thai joint. In my experience, most Thai restaurants I've been to in Vancouver look like they are holes in the walls with very minimal decoration.  Now that's fine because the focus is on the food and less so presentation. U&I breaks this mold by offering a sophisticated presentation, but doesn't forget about the quality aspect of food.  There are a few go to staples that I must try when I go to new Thai place. You've got your key basics: Green Curry, Pad Thai, and Spring Rolls. Me love you long Thai, so lets share!Green Curry: one of the most flavourful curries I've had since Koh Chang, Thailand. The broth has a grainy thickness to it that makes me believe there is a lot of grinded up herbs.  It really shows as it packs a punch.  Even when I had no rice left we proceeded to eat the broth like soup.  It's simply too good to waste.  Also a rarity in Vancouver, the curry had both Bamboo shoots and Eggplant.  Usually you only see Eggplant in green curry and bamboo shots in red.   Tip: it's an option to request spice levels - 1 to 5.  I went with the 4 which was just right.  No lingering burning but just the right amount of kick that doesn't take away from the flavour. The one con about this dish is the amount of rice they give you.  Its a tad small and in my opinion should be doubled to pair with the amount of curry. Pad Thai: my first impression was the noodles were very soft.  Very important in my world that my noodles are fresh and tender.  I'm not the biggest Pad Thai fan in the world, and wasn't the one who ordered this at my table, however this is a dish that I would try again and recommend to Pad Thai lovers. Spring Rolls: Served fresh, crispy and with fair wrapper thickness.  The beauty of these spring rolls is in which they are cut diagonally.  This allows for the fresh rolls to breath, as they were too hot to consume right away and the cut also shows you the ingredients inside before you bite in. Service: Thai level friendliness.  I threw out some basic words that I picked up in Thailand, and low and behold a proper response.  Legit Thai service is always a bonus.  Was also impressed with their helpfulness with the wine list and recommendations based on our order.  It's only a few dollars more per dish than your local hole in a wall Thai place, but with superior service and presentation.  A must try for Thai lovers in the Cambie area."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've made plenty of Yelp friends over the years, but there are a select few I would trust on a recommendation without a second thought.

And holy shit, per usual, I was not lead astray. When we showed up I took a look at the menu and as it was lunch, the list was not too long. Two vegetarian options, only one a main course, and I have to admit I was concerned. I thought \\"That one main dish better be gangster or I'm going to be pissed, driving all the way over here.....\\" I'm looking at you Ruggy and JT!Lucky for all the meal blew me away. The dish: a coconut soup noodle bowl, including tofu, king oyster mushrooms, shallots, and more. Amazingly tasty, really, and it arrived with a side dish of lime, cilantro, and chili paste so you can mix it to your liking.I normally hesitate on an \\"omg 5 star\\" kind of review for only one visit, but the oyster mushrooms had me hooked. I love mushrooms, they could have used shiitake or even button and the flavor would have been great, but to use king oyster was brilliant. A buttery, almost meaty texture, pairing beautifully with the chilly paste and lime. Plus my blood orange w/ gin cocktail was spot on, these people know how to mix a drink.God I love Thai food, it's my favorite, and Pok Pok really elevated what could have been just a good dish to something far more.

To make reservations one must book online.  OK.  Then we found out it was $20 PER PERSON---- NON REFUNDABLE ! Really? Kinda pricey. So, we took our chances and got there at 12:15 for our 12:30 lunch date. They opened at 11:30 AM that day. After everyone was there we got seated in the plastic enclosed eating area next to the hostess podium. Table was a wooden picnic table with a floral PLASTIC tablecloth and a heater hanging above us. Waitress was professional and fairly attentive. Got the menu and found out that a \\"house white wine\\" you had to ask the waitress. Fortunately, there was a chalkboard nearby with the food and drink specials and wine prices on it.  $12 for a \\"house white wine\\". $11 for a red. WTF ? REALLY ? That's outrageous in my book.  Pure greed. So, I ordered a Tsing Tao Chinese beer for $5.50. The chicken wings that everyone raves about were just OK. Kinda chewy and somewhat dried out. The other dishes were just OK too.  Most tasted very similar. The bill came and with a generous 20+ % tip was $180 for six. $30 each.Would we come here again? Probably not. Even though this place has a James Beard Foundation Award I would expect a higher quality food.  Remember they started out in a food cart... actually the food was food cart quality in my book. Perhaps the James Beard Foundation Award people should do what the Michelin people do... rate the restaurant EVEY year and keep them on their toes so the chefs don't slide into mediocrity.

It is something special and not just any ordinary Thai place. Short story this place has some unique food and limited seating, but worth the experience.\\nLong story: long line. Better get there early because it will be a wait. It's not really a line, but more like people waiting in a huddle outside. Go put your name on the list now! They will text you when they are ready for you. They told me it would be about a 45 minute wait, but it was only about 20 minutes on a weekend right before noon. There is also only two unisex restrooms and a line to use them. We got seated near the entrance which was fine. Server was friendly and attended my every need. Just a look at the menu, you can tell it is a very unique place with a unique menu. First thing is that it is pricey here but let me reassure you that it is worth the experience. \\nFor drinks we got the Thai iced tea w/evaporated milk. Served ni a bottle with a cup of ice on the side. It was really creamy and good to calm down the spice levels of your food. The drinking vinegar [$5] was something special. I got the tamarind flavor. I guess you can almost compare it to a Jarritos. Their water is also flavored with some sort of leaves, but forgot what they were called. At first I thought it had a hint of coconut but it wasn't.Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings [$15]. Yeah, its the real deal. This dish defines what Pok Pok is all about. You get six whole chicken wings, choice of spicy or not-spicy. The spicy wings was fiery goodness and made me sweat tears of joy. It was a little too salty at first but after my taste buds got used to it, the wings flew into my mouth. Garnished with a side of veggies to cool you down. *sips the thai iced tea*Kung Op Wun Sen [$18.50] This is a bit pricey in my opinion for what you get. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I just wanted more. Maybe that's a good thing. It comes with wild caught gulf prawns, and sadly I think there were only three delicious pieces. Pork belly in there was flavorful but again, there were like only two pieces. The noodles were fantastic and flavorful with the sauce. Served in a clay pot. So authentic. My taste buds definitely exploded when I reached this dish.Muu Paa Kham Waan [$15.50] aka Boar collar meat. The spiciest dish. The best dish. Served with chilled mustard greens which was embedded in shaved ice. Could not get enough of this at all. Meat was so juicy and tender, it was like nothing I have had before. Make sure to get a bite of the greens in between to chill out that heat. *sips thai iced tea* There was plenty of flavor there, I think I made some moaning noises in between bites. Total bill w/tip a little over $60+. Food is definitely five star and winning in my books. Its just for the price and portion do no match. Small space and limited seating with wait time can damper a spirit. But the first bite will make you forget about that wait. Each dish was full of flavor and seasoning. They have taken the journey from East to West and brought authentic cultural taste to the heart of Portland(and other locations). Add this to your bucket list.

In the meantime, a table that arrived after us ordered, received their beverages and even their salad course. We were ignored.I don't want to gripe on this too much, because the waiter (and for that matter the entire restaurant crew, all three of them), was visible the entire time. That waiter was not slacking off, he was always moving and always doing something. That something just never involved taking our order. I swear he tried, but food kept coming up and he was apparently duty bound to deliver it immediately, no matter what else. My patience can only extend so far.Eventually we ordered, and our food, too, arrived in rapid succession. My sister's entree arrived when she was not more than a few bites into her salad (pacing, anyone?).I had the monkfish, with mushrooms and a marsalla sauce over pasta. A little too sweet for my taste, but some red pepper flakes helped. Still not a home run. I knew I should have ordered calamari something.My sister had the swordfish, and again I was not impressed.There's no denying the place has some charm, but I still don't consider it a positive experience overall.

If you've ever eaten at the original Co'm on Buford, Co'm Dunwoody is very different.  While the original Co'm is a small and casual Vietnamese restaurant, Co'm Dunwoody is bigger, more upscale, features a full bar, live salsa music on Friday nights, and offers \\"Indochine\\" (French-influenced) dishes on the menu.  It's a far cry from Co'm on Buford Highway.I've never been to a Vietnamese restaurant with so much French and Indochinese influence.  The inside of the restaurant is decorated with furniture, large paintings, decorations, and memorabilia from the era when the French colonized Vietnam.  The men's bathroom even has pictures of Tintin (from \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\") and his adventures in French-colonized Vietnam (see attached photo).The menu is thick and heavy, but it's all in the presentation as there are only four pages inside, two of which are drinks.  The background of each page looks like French-Vietnamese propaganda.  The appetizers include typical items such as spring rolls and grape leaf rolls (the same ones that the original Co'm is known for).  And like the original Co'm, they serve co'm (fragrant rice) and bun (thin rice vermicelli noodles) entrees.  They also offer about a dozen different \\"Indochine\\" dishes, many of which include lamb and fish.  Since these dishes are unique to the restaurant, I had to try one of them.We ended up ordering:\\nLa lot - grape leaf rolls with beef\\nBanh hoi - flat rice vermicelli noodles with pork and vegetables, wrapped\\nIndochine lamb bourguignon - French lamb stew with vegetables and egg noodlesThe grape leaf rolls (similar to, but not to be confused with betel leaves) were pretty good.  The grape leaves have a somewhat \\"snappy\\" consistency to them.  The dish had lots of fish sauce and the inside of the rolls were savory and juicy.  The rolls came with a small dish of sambal oelek chili paste (the same garlic-chili paste you find in plastic bottles at pho noodle houses).The banh hoi was very good.  These are fresh rolls you wrap yourself by dipping the wrapping paper into water.  They provide you with plenty of ingredients to wrap a delicious roll including lettuce, cucumber, daikon, carrots, basil, cilantro, etc.  These are just like the rolls you can order at Chateau de Saigon on Buford Highway.The lamb stew was an interesting dish.  You can order this dish spicy, which I did because I like spicy food.  It was huge chunks of lamb, sweet potato, and various garnishes on top of some egg noodles in a chili-red broth.  This dish was quite flavorful.  As thick as the pieces of lamb were, they were surprisingly tender, probably because it was a stew.  I enjoyed the egg noodles, but I love all types of noodle soups (ramen, udon, Hong Kong-style, pho, etc.).Overall, the food was good, but salty.  I can't remember the last time I drank so much water during and after my meal.  I was chugging water right up until I went to bed that night!  As for the prices, they are high for Vietnamese cuisine (e.g. dinner entrees range anywhere from $12-19 each).  You can probably get most of the same items except for the \\"Indochine\\" dishes on Buford Highway for significantly less.  The French host/bartender was friendly and our server, John, provided good service.Co'm Dunwoody is located in the Shops of Dunwoody shopping complex, immediately north of the Chamblee Dunwoody-Mt.

He told me that it started as a small hut next in front of a house that eventually converted to a full-on restaurant due to popularity. When we got there around 6:30 on a Thursday night, the wait for a seat inside was 45 minutes. There was the patio seating with heat lamps, which we were told was still a little cold, or the upstairs patio , which seated 3 tables of two. It had heat lamps too, and had a heavy curtain that blocked the cold really well, when people weren't walking in or out. We opted for the upstairs patio and it was a fine compromise considering we were super hungry and didn't want to wait the 45 minutes. It did get a bit hot at times, but we were able to control the heat lamps from where we were sitting. \\nThey have a good selection of whiskeys to chose from. We tried one of the house specials, the tamarind whiskey sour. It tasted very much like tamarind, and though I like my drinks a little stronger, it got my taste buds ready for what was to come. \\nWe ordered the Papaya Pok Pok (green papaya salad) with sticky rice, Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, Thai sweet pork curry, and baby back ribs. \\nThe papaya salad was as good as I've ever tasted. It is pretty spicy, but not overwhelmingly so that you can't enjoy the sweet and tangy flavors that make this dish so popular. \\nThe wings were more delicious than I expected, even with all the hype from friends. In fact, all three tables on the small patio ordered the papaya salad and wings. \\nThe favorite for the night, however was the pork curry, so good that we were scraping the clay pot with our leftover sticky rice. \\nThe four dishes was more than enough for the two of us.

I have often proclaimed this to be the best and my favorite restaurant in Boston. I've had many great experiences here. But every time I go, the experience gets worse and worse. I wonder if the restaurant is becoming a victim of its own success. FIrst off, the place is so popular that despite booking early we couldn't get a table for 8 until 9:30pm on a Saturday night. When we got there at 9:30, we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated. The service, while friendly was very slow. Not that we were looking to finish the meal quickly, but we didn't get out of there until 12:30am. It just felt like we were being forgotten. Even at the very end of the night when we were pretty much the only table left, the servers were more concerned about cleaning than giving us the check. We had to finally flag someone down. With that said, I still think the food is on point. I got the halibut ceviche for an appetizer. It was very fresh and tasted delicious. Got the monkfish for a main entree. It was cooked perfectly, the staetzle, grilled onion, and ham were great compliments to the fish. For dessert, we got the strawberry shortcake donut, which was fantastic. But the pineapple upside down cake was very dry and disappointing. The food continues to be great but at the prices they charge, I expect the service and the experience to be great too.

He took drink orders but took forever to get them to us. We ordered appetizers and then after an hour, he FINALLY took our entree orders. He tried to talk us out of the Mushroom soup, which was quite tasty by the way, and was very negative on most of our selections. Not professional at all. This guy should be taking drive thru orders and NOT working an establishment such as this. We never got asked for additional drinks and had to beg for water. And they weren't even that busy. I think he took several smoke breaks? After clearing the table, asked if dessert was going to happen, and when we said no, immediately presented the check.

We got there in time for happy hour but by the time the server took our order, it was past the time so he didn't honor the happy hour menu.

Our server brought our garlic knots which r extremely greasy with no napkins. I had to get us some napkins myself. I also had to go to the bar and remind them about my drink. Then our food came and it was gross!! My boyfriend's $10 pasta was cold and really did not taste good. My sandwich was dry and bland with an exorbitant amount of bread and our other friend's meatball sandwich was also cold, dry and tasted weird. We couldn't believe we waited well over an hour for this meal!! It wasn't even crowded or busy, with lots of empty tables!! I was never asked if I wanted another drink, my boyfriend had to wait another long time for a refill on his beer and we were never offered more water. Then when the server gave us the bill, he said (keep in mind that my boyfriend was there with his 11 yr old),\\"Sorry about that, we were busy because of stupid father's day!\\"....then we had upset stomachs the next morning.

No reservations needed, plenty of room, attentive, friendly and fast service, no hassle, simple. The servers automatically split the checks without giving you hard time.

The bartender recommended getting the wings non-spicy since the papaya salad is spicy and that was definitely the right move. The wait was about 45 minutes but the bar is open seating with full menu as well. I actually enjoyed the experience at the bar because the bar tender was interactive with us and gave us ordering/eating tips. I.e. If you order the side of sticky rice, don't take the entire chunk out at once because it will dry out/harden really quickly. So leave it in the bamboo container so that it will stay warm/moist.

We decided to order up tapas, every couple at the table ordered 4 or 5, then of course did the mandatory pass around the table. Did not have ANYTHING that was not delicious. I must have sampled about 30 different tapas, and they were amazing. I couldn't even give you tips on what to order, as I don't think there's enough space in this review slot for that. Ask the waiter for recommendations, and go with your gut. You will be happy no matter what you order. Of course, when you order that much, it will end up being a bit on the pricey side, however all of us in the group had such an amazing experience, it was absolutely well worth it.

The dish was far too sweet and neither the meat nor any hot sauce I added was able to drown it out.  I also found the noodles to be slightly overcooked, although that wasn't really an issue compared to how off the flavor was.Final Comment:\\nI would come here again to try the Vietnamese side of their menu, as I have heard good things about it.  It may be a bit unfair to base my opinion off of a Thai dish, but that's all I really have to work with, and to be fair, they did advertise themselves as a Thai and Vietnamese restaurant.

Overall everything was good, nothing to brag about, but plain and simple good.  I didn't eat too many of the rolls, I think the only type of roll I tried was one piece of the spider roll. To be honest, I couldn't even really tell if it was soft shell crab.  I had a lot of nigiri and the salmon roe nigiri (which I suspected to be artificial salmon roe, it tasted too sweet to be real). The sashimi is a very limited selection and they serve it in individual pieces on a small saucer. It's done this way to prevent waste of food... cause we all know there are a lot of fatties out there that take more than their fat bellies can take. No big deal.  The salmon tartare with spicy mayo in the sashimi section was pretty good though. I think I had several of those. lol  The oysters were okay, I only had a couple. They do have snow crab legs, so be sure to indulge on those. I didn't have much of the hot food, but it all did look good. One thing to definitely try is the udon.  Go up to the teriyaki area and ask the guy behind the counter for udon.  Add a bit of the panko and chili powder.. and you are set.  The broth was flavorful and the udon was nice n chewy. As for dessert, the crepes were nice and they have a few different flavors of soft serve ice cream, including green tea! If you have family and friends in town, this is a nice place to take them.

The bread is particularly good - crunchy on the outside, but still soft and warm. All of the ingredients for every sandwich are fresh and flavorful, and the variety of sandwich options is excellent.My main complaint is that the sandwiches are too big to be lunch-sized, really - maybe they should have half-sandwich options for lunch.

The smoked chicken paired with beets, kale, parm and their fresh made dressing is amazing. So not is it good, its good for you! Smoke Ring also gets creative with a few of the other dishes on their menu offering lettuce wraps with a BBQ twist and a great burger. Appetizer favorites are the nachos made with fries (you could seriously eat this as a meal) and the fried okra (its whole and delicious when dipped in their white sauce).  Favorite sides are the brussel sprouts and mac & cheese. Desserts - you can't go wrong with any of them but the bread pudding is phenomenal.

The full grilled hen (Kai Yaang) which I really enjoyed and thought the two sauces that came with it really added some good flavor to the chicken, but I think our table thought it was better then the pork.  Then we had the pork short ribs (Sii Khrong Muu Yaang) and they were very good with a nice smokey flavor to them and better then the pork skewers and chicken.  Lastly, the final two dishes and we loved them both equally were the boar shoulder (Muu Paa Kham Waan) and the grilled prawns (Kung Yak Phao).  The sauce for the grilled prawns was awesome and mighty spicy, at least for me, made my eyes water for several minutes, wow!  With the boar came some freshly cut mustard greens which was absolutely brillant and perfect with this dish!  Overall, we'd go again if and when we're looking for that authentic Thai taste and experience!The restuarant is kind of a hodge-podge of indoor and outdoor eating with the indoor being in a low ceiling older and smallish size room with not much of a decor to write home about and the outdoor seating has the plastic corregated roof with some picnic tables and heater lamps.

I liked the space and airiness in the restaurant. It was a bright sunny day, and they had the front windows completely open onto the sidewalk, making it feel even larger. Bonus: I'm not sure if it's a weekly special, but they had a $19 bottle of Chardonnay on the specials board that day.Now, onto the food. We ordered the pad thai, yum woon sen and the five spice fish. The flavours in the pad thai were good, and the texture of the noodles was perfect, but it was far too salty and sugary. It felt like it was just doused in too much sauce - which was sad, because I liked that they actually used tamarind instead of ketchup and had high hopes for its authenticity. The yum woon sen was a glass noodle salad with ground pork and fresh herbs. The lime juice dressing was refreshing, but didn't really have the depth of flavor I like to see in this dish. I ordered it medium spicy and it had no kick to it at all. Also absent from the dish were the dried shrimp and fried garlic - which adds the pungency and aroma I love so much about yum woon sen. The five spice fish was good, if not authentic. It was coated in a hot crispy batter, and was topped with a savoury-sweet sauce and garlic chives. In summary, all the food was fresh and the quality of ingredients is good, but its execution, as well as the atmosphere, definitely has a heavily Westernized flare."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Great place to spend a rainy day with the kids.

Tried the black pasta with squid, shrimp scampi, and the seafood mix with my friends and I've never had more flavorful pasta. The black pasta has a heartier texture than most pastas, which made it different enough to be extremely satisfying. The seafood mix we got had everything except the lobster and it was super good.

And the crepe was juuust right.At the risk of sounding clich√©, I felt a tremendous sense of contentment while sitting in the booth in the warm lights while it was a dull, drizzly day outside. It truly did feel like an escape. I attribute a lot of that feeling to whomever decorated the place -- it's a perfect blend of sophistication, whimsy, and warmth. It looks small from the outside, but the vaulted ceilings compliment the coziness perfectly.

I haven't had Wisconsin style frozen custard for a long time and was curious how it made its way to Vancouver in this unlikely location snuggled in between the entry way to a rental residential building and the Japanese hair salon.  This spot is opened by a brother and sister team, and the brother lived in the Midwest for a while and talked his sister into trying Wisconsin style frozen custard.  Unfortunately, since it is the soft opening, they had run out of the true custard mix (the one with eggs in it) and were running the machines on a soft serve type mix.  I have to say the consistency was just like the Wisconsin style frozen custard I've had - very little air in it.  A nice dense creamy feel.  I'm really looking forward to the custard mix returning sometime next week to try the full deal.For now I'll give 4 stars, but this promises to be a 5 star when they get the real custard mix.  If you are going to visit for the first time, keep the mix differences in perspective!  This spot holds a lot of promise for bringing a taste of Wisconsin to Vancouver that I haven't found here before.They will also be offering coffee, steamies (for the Montreal lovers among us), and Wisconsin mud burgers (burger in a bowl covered with chili).The official opening will be sometime next week when they get their order of custard mix in from the dairy - I'm looking forward to it!"},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is probably one of the worst izakaya he service is not great.

However, last Sunday when we passed by around 2:00 there was not a single person in line!  I had to take advantage of this opportunity -- because after we were seated (about 15 minutes later) a line of about 10 appeared out of no where!  Do not enter and ask how long the wait will be, I bet they get that question about 40 times a day and therefore the response is not sugar coated and actually pretty rude.  They are very abrupt and do not crack a smile or politeness until you're paying the bill to leave. Now, this place is the smallest out of any of the North End places I've been.  Our table was literally sitting in the kitchen (but not in a fancy, you paid for this type of way).  We were seated at the same table as a father and son who had just finished their food and were waiting for a check.  After about 20 minutes of waiting we had plastic water cups and a pitcher delivered to our table with some torn bread and packaged butter.  Now, the prices are not the most expensive you will see in the Norther End but they certainly are not the cheapest.  I don't expect 5 class service, but a little more than this.  After the father and son left, the bus boy has to reach over out heads to clear the table (but left a lot of the trash and bread there).  About 30 minutes after taking our seat, the waitress came over to take our order on the back of place mat.  We ordered the Sicilian Clams, that came in a olive oil, garlic, white wine sauce.  They were delicious.   I would have dipped an entire loaf a bread into the sauce if I wasn't too scared to ask for more.  Then we got the clams and calamari in red sauce and in white sauce.  The red sauce was lacking any sort of flavor, but the white sauce was delicious.  There was far too much olive oil in the dish though -- it was coating everything and made eating the leftovers kind of gross (although I did it anyways).  When we got up to pay we heard they did not have any small bills.  So we ended up tipping about 25% on service that was non-existent.  It was either that or giving a 10% tip.  I think cash only places should at least have change for you and not leave you in a standstill to decide to under tip or over tip.They do do takeout.  So that may change people's reviews.  I don't think i will return, especially if there is a line there.

Not to mention the nice little salad and toasted piece of focaccia bread to balance out the meal.   The meatballs were fantastic and sooo filling! The texture reminded me of a falafel...I definitely tasted some chickpeas in there. But they were a nice size and went great with the sauce and pasta.   What I loved the most is that I didn't walk away with that feeling where you are so full, you are almost feel sick to your stomach. It was more of a nice, satisfied, belly is pleasantly full feeling.  The portion sizes were perfect!     But obviously you can't skip having something sweet after a meal like that. My friends and I checked in on Yelp and each scored a mini cannoli . It was delicious and delightful!Service was really attentive. Our server went over the entire menu with us which was great since it could be a little confusing with all of the options. I really liked that. Just a few tidbits- the close at 8pm during the week and they are closed on Sundays. It's a tiny little shop in a small strip mall on the corner of Lake Underhill and Goldenrod so getting to it can be a challenge but definitely worth it.   There are only a handful of tables inside so it can get full fairly quickly. Also, plenty of gluten free options too."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Awfully good and well executed.

Known for their pok pok wings, I knew I had to order them. Came here on a Tuesday night with no reservations. We parked the car and luckily enough, someone had canceled and we got seating for two immediately. We were escorted to the back where we were seated next to other twosies.  And also where we can see the bbq pit masters bbqing up the pok pok wings in these grills they use down south for roasting pigs and all the delicious bbq food. For drinks I ordered the Thai ice tea and my boyfriend ordered the ice tea. I had to water down my Thai ice tea with my cold water because it was just too sweet. For entree we ordered the pok pok wings, of course and the vercimelli bowl that came with pork belly and succulent shrimp. My boyfriend actually came here about two weeks ago and I guessed he didn't follow what yelp reviewers told him to order and he ordered wrong! He got the rib which was a big piece of marinated roast rib/pork which you can get in dtla or nyct. Which didn't wow him, really. But this time when we came, we ordered just enough to fill our stomachs. The wings were succulent and the vercimelli / glass noodles were flavorful."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Nori Nori is pretty awesome.  I was first introduced to this restaurant while I was a student at Tech.  Back then, it was called Minado.  Since that time, it closed and re-opened as Badayori.  Badayori closed and re-opened as Nori Nori.  Throughout all the name changes, the restaurant has remained the same: a premium sushi buffet.  To this day, it's still probably the best sushi buffet I've experienced.  My college friends who introduced me to this restaurant even held their wedding reception here.I've only been to Nori Nori for dinner, where the price has slowly creeped up throughout the years.  Currently, you can expect to spend about $30 per person for dinner.  I think it's a reasonable price given the combination of quality and quantity of sushi that is offered at dinnertime.  If you're a big eater, it's certainly a good value.  Along with maki (rolls), nigiri, and sashimi, Nori Nori has a hot bar and cold bar with various Asian entrees.  Some are quite good including the Oysters Rockefeller, yari ika (spear squid), asparagus salad, and Japanese okra (with miso vinegar).The sushi is buffet quality sushi, but it's among the best buffet quality sushi around.  Since it's a buffet, you'll still run into pieces that aren't very fresh just because they've been sitting out for a while.  The offerings on the floor are constantly changing and my only real gripe with this place is the chefs can be really slow and/or non-responsive to customer requests to re-stock particular pieces of sushi.  It can be pretty annoying, especially when they acknowledge and don't do anything.It is pretty cool they have all-you-can-eat sashimi, but the types of fish are expectedly the most basic: tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.  The quality of the sashimi may vary.  I've had both good and bad.  Good for them for stocking some non-standard buffet nigiri including torigai (cockle clam) and tsubugai (whelk).  Also, there is an udon noodle station and a crepe station, where Nori Nori chefs will customize and cook a bowl of udon or a crepe just for you.  I usually skip the udon station and pound down more sushi instead.There isn't much to speak of in terms of the service since this is a buffet, but what little service you do get is usually good.  Nori Nori doesn't take reservations unless you have a party of 10 or more.  I've never had a problem with getting seated here.  The restaurant is spacious and clean and looks pretty elegant for a buffet.  Be sure to grab one of their desk calendars on the way out.  You may have to ask for it."},{"name":"The Halal Gurus","address":"539 W Oltorf S","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious!!!

We ordered two dishes, the sauteed Chinese vegetables and the kung pow chicken. Our water, utensils, dishes and food were all thrown onto our table with effective deliberate speed within thirty seconds of seating, taking efficiency to a whole new, unwelcoming level. This along with the aggressive nature and conversation of the staff continued to add to the foreign atmosphere, making you feel like you don't belong, which is quite an accomplishment for dinning in your own city. The \\"Sauteed Chinese Vegetables\\" are not an assortment of all kinds of different vegetables, as one would reasonably expect, but a mound of green stalks. When I inquired as to the lack of assortment in the chef's vegetable choices, I was told that this was the \\"chinese vegetable\\" and if I desired a mix, I should have requested the \\"Vegetarian Delight\\". Guess I should have realized that the chinese do not eat any type of vegetable besides spinach. Nowhere on the menu does it explain the components of any dish. The kung pow chicken was good. Water was never refiled, and the plentiful portions are served in cheap plastic dishes that lack any sort of aesthetic, a reflection of the dinning area itself. Our check, covered in oranges and fortune cookies, was thrown at us by a mute, terribly efficient waiter as we were two minutes into digging into our meal.

MSB isn't your typical restaurant where - you come in, you're seated, your order is taken, nope, you place your order at the counter (I advise you look at the menu prior to - so you won't hold up the line and become frustrated due to all the delectable descriptions of food choices), Jacob was so patient and helpful!! Thank you by the way!! They have a fun question of the month (mines was \\"what's your favorite meal at Thanksgiving?\\") choose a table that'll accommodate your party, grab your drinks (another place that has great sweet tea) and wait until your answer is called from the question that you answer previously, enjoy your food, and you bus your own tables. I actually like this set up and idea. Very different. \\nI ordered The Sticky Maple (Flaky biscuit, all-natural fried chicken breast, pecanwood smoked bacon, all topped with Bissell Family Farm real maple syrup) it was ok, the chicken tasted slightly rubbery and seasonless. HOWEVER, The Biscuit Frenche, made up for it, talk about outstanding! The flavor is forever embedded in my taste buds, so savory and tasteful. Mmmmmm... please do your tongue, stomach, and body a favor and order this, the only disappointment you'll have is not ordering two. One to eat there and the other to eat on your next destination."},{"name":"Harvest Bistro","address":"14100 Bonnet Creek Resort Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The food here and at the restaurant outside by the pool is very good. The chicken sandwich had plump, tender chicken breast with a flavorful sauce. The roll was soft and the sandwich wasn't bready tasting. The homemade potato chips are also really good (and fresh made). The pickle was large and delicious.My pepperoni pizza was good too, more for 2 or 3 people (I ordered one for just me and it was more than I could eat).Best of all they serve filtered water which is $4 a bottle if you buy it at the hotel.-------- Start Florida water rant! ------ The water in Florida tastes like sulfur water and I really appreciated that they're this is the only place we've had filtered water.Good water is like liquid gold here and we've spent a lot more than I wanted to on it. It ruins the taste of anything from a soda fountain. We're here for a conference and I wish they had bottled water available instead of just soda. I guess it's at a premium though. So if you're coming from out of state you may want to BYW - bring your own water.I wanted to use Amazon Prime Now to have water delivered to the hotel but my SO said no. So we drank the 2 bottles in the room ($3 each). There's no Aquafina at this hotel, either. It's a Florida brand, which honestly messes with me because I can't help but be afraid it's going to taste like swamp water. I get flashbacks to the time I was so thirsty I drank the water by some hot springs. Tasted awful and I  worried I'd get giardia.------- End water rant! ------My biggest complaint is that it's so slow. There was a wait for lunch though many tables were full of people just chatting after eating. Food took a long time. They apologized (I was starving) but it seems to be the norm. I noticed the same thing with the beach restaurant. Even if it's not full. There's a slow beat everything moves to.Also, warning, I spent over $10 on a bag of candy after lunch. It's more than Vegas (on strip) prices. Priced by the pound with no scale. This is dangerous. Just a warning because if your kids want some like my kid did, it won't be cheap.Would I eat here again? Yes. The food is pretty good. Nice selection, flavors are wonderful and not clique or too out there. As long as I plan for a slower pace and avoid buying the candy, I would be happy. Although I prefer the pool restaurant by a little, but sometimes it's raining or you want something more formal, and this restaurant fits. It's better than a lot of hotel restaurants.

The lamb shank was cooked well but there appeared to be no seasoning at all in the tomato sauce it was cooked in. It was flat and tinny and frankly kind of bitter. The gnocchi had been substituted out for corona beans and greens which were very undercooked and gritty which made them inedible. Quite frankly they were NOT an adequate substitute for gnocchi. My hamburger was well cooked, but the pork belly on top of it was charred and dry and the \\"caper aioli\\" was more like a couple of capers stirred into mayo.\\nGiven how dissatisfied we were we did complain and were comped a couple of deserts.

Not much to complain about to be honest but nothing outstanding either. \\n-Rib with JD bbq sauce (4/5): One of the better food items I've had so far at BP. The meat was fall off the bone and the JD Bbq sauce was nicely drenched over the ribs. \\n-Veggies and Caesar salad was mediocre and came in huge portions. The entire dish was a lot to finish in general. It also came with a toast.-Cactus cut chips (3.5/5): The chips themselves were not too good. It was drenched in so much oil that half the chips were soggy but the dipping sauce... oh the dipping sauce is addictive. It's like a spicy sour cream. Individual pizza (salami, bocconcini, pepperoni - 2.5/5): It's a good appy to share but I wouldn't order this to myself. I think it's just my preference of neo pizza over american pizza. The base and the crust was too thick. I would praise them for serving it the cheese super melty; definitely did some cheese pulls eating this.

We are regular wine drinkers, and love to explore restaurants.ATMOSPHERE - The ambiance was modern while lightly rustic, an amazing example of the restaurants declared modern take on Classic Provencal French cuisine. We were promptly greeted at the door by the lovely hostess Siobahn (Chevon), our rain soaked coats put away for us, and seated quickly. After climbing the stairs we were greeted by one of the managers, a Mr. Sam Wolf, and treated with the utmost respect and courtesy as we were shown to our table.SERVICE - Our server was Max, who greeted us immediately and offered menus as well as an overview of the appetizer, entree, and wine specials for the evening. We leisurely enjoyed our hour or so long meal, as Max enthusiastically offered my friends descriptions and suggestions for their appetizers (petite bouchess / small bites), and entrees through out the evening. Few restaurants can boast at having such a highly knowledgeable, passionate, and thoroughly trained staff. We enjoyed amazing service, in particular the small details, such as having our napkins folded if we ever left the table, our water never went below half-full, and prompt attention at the slightest signs. The silverware and glassware is predominantly Riedel, and is a reflection of this restaurants attention to detail, and refinement.FOOD - We started with a new anchovy based appetizer, which was delicious and oddly reminded me of well-made sushi, as well as a selection of the barbajuans. The later were delicious, chicken-liver and foie gras, goat-cheese and honey, and a new herb-based one as well.  I had the mackerel dish from the premier plats section, since I had eaten earlier, loved it. My friends has the stuffed calamari, pork rillette, lamb shank, and grilled sea bass. They were all cooked to perfection, and offered a delicious complexity of flavor and texture.WINE - Our wine for the evening was the Lemmelson, offered by the glass, a Pinot Noir from Oregon, which was amazingly rich in depth and complexity, a deep dark cherry, light pepper notes, a bit of aged barnyard earthiness, and a nice oak finish to round it out. At $15 / glass, it's entirely worth it, but I would suggest the $65 / bottle if you're with friends. The Sommelier's curated collection of French, Italian, and American wine spans 25+ pages, and is a sight to behold.FINAL - This is a fine dinning establishment, and as such the price point is higher than most other restaurants, but it is a price which is well earned. For the quality of food, wine, and service, it was a deal my friends and I were glad to pay and plan to again. I'd suggest this restaurant for anyone looking for a nice evening out with a date or friends, a chance to explore French cuisine and wine, or for a business function were only the best is expected.In a word, ineffable.

One of the best in the Boston area.I have had almost everything on the menu here and am hard-pressed to find anything to complain about.  I am not crazy about the turkey dinner (previously steamed? and served with no dressing) and the fact that the restaurant doesn't offer baked potatoes.  Nor do I care for the oven-roasted Greek potatoes.  They are oil-soaked, not crispy; not appetizing at all for me, but other friends enjoy them.  Last night I and two other friends had the Souvlaki, one pork (me) and two chicken; the fourth in our party had the Pastitsio.  All were tasty, perfectly cooked to our specifications and more than enough; we all took cartons away.I thing BK's salads are the best around.  They are fresh and full;  what I like most, however, is that the lettuce is Iceberg.  I suffer from the thought that in other restaurants, where \\"fresh baby greens\\" are touted, they dump those greens out of a bag and do not wash them.  At BK, the salad appears to be and tastes clean and fresh.  The fish dishes are always fresh and perfectly seasoned, be they fried or broiled or baked.  My favorite fish dish is not on the regular menu, but is often served as a special.  Haddock in an onion and tomato sauce!!!!  Out of this world.  The Lamb Kokkinisto, lamb baked on the bone is a real treat; traditional Greek flavors, fall-off-the-bone-lamb and the delicate seasoning I love in this dish and in the sauce that comes with BK's rice, it has an exotic aroma and subtle taste of cumin or cinnamon or allspice..... Subtle and delicious. Did I mention the sandwiches at lunch?  All great. I can't count the times I just ordered a tuna topped salad because I know the tuna never disappoints.  The Clubs are devine.  The Artichoke Fran√ßoise  and the Chicken Francoise may be a little heavy with sauce, but isn't it the sauce that draws us to the dish.  And finally, the Avgolemono Soup -- the lure, for me, of any good Greek restaurant.  BK's soup is lovely; they give you huge portions, so make sure you know what you're ordering.  It is delicious, fragrant with lemon and rice-filled chicken stock.  A little too much chicken in the soup for me, but no one else I know complains about that....The staff, the servers are wonderful. Always welcoming,  pleasant, always helpful.  Always \\"Greek,\\" my Greek friend says. Every dining experience I have had at BK has only been enhanced by the server.What kept me from reviewing BK for so many years????  I guess I should want to share it, but I don't want to have to wait too long for a table!!!  Go as soon as you can...."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We visited for a weekday lunch.

You have officially blown me away. Congrats. This food here is downright righteous. It is filled with so much flavor and just so. damn. good. I can't even. When my friends and I came to Portland we knew we wanted to visit this place. On our last day here, we decided just HOURS before our flight was going to depart back to Los Angeles, that we would come here. The wait here is a bit annoying because it can get long, like everyone says but it is nice knowing they will text you when your table is ready. I can see the annoyance of coming here during the summer because when we came, it was so hot outside, it was not pleasant and they have very limited indoor seating. We were fortunate to get indoor seating for our party and during our wait time for a table we decided to explore the little shops surrounding this place. When we received our text saying our table was ready we went to sit down.Service here is fast. So that worked out in our favor. I ended up ordering the Drinking Vinegar in Pineapple flavor ($5.00), the Kung Op Wu Sen ($16.50) and the famous Spicy Wings ($15.50). And all of it was delicious. Thanks for the recommendations Clayton W (our server was extremely knowledgable ask for him, he knew the menu and how to pronounce all menu items -- unlike me LOL)Drinking Vinegar - Pineapple: I have never had drinking vinegar before or have heard of it but I decided to try it. It was an interesting flavor. You can definitely taste the vinegar but it was also strangely satisfying. The drink is made with all organic cane vinegar, and all natural pineapple. The drink did have a carbonation to it which made it kind of like a soda but not as sweet. I ended up finding out that drinking vinegar is really good for digestion, constipation and reducing gas! So this drink has medicinal benefits on top of tasting refreshing!Kung Op Wu Sen: let. me. tell. you. something. This dish I devoured. IT IS SO FREAKING GOOD. UGH. The \\"salsa\\" they give you on the side is OUT OF THIS WORLD. ASK FOR EXTRA!! UGH. I loved every component of this dish other than that I wish the portion was bigger than what it already is!!! The noodles in this dish are cooked in like a hot pot, so at the bottom the sauce they make kind of caramelizes and when mixing it with the noodles it's heaven. Pork belly and freshly caught HUGE prawns. This dish really is a kick on the tongue. The combination of soy sauce, ginger, cilantro root, black pepper, Chinese celery and noodles just are outrageous. This dish definitely encapsulates Chinese influence on Thai food. GET THIS DISH. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I would order this again, and again and again. So good!Spicy Wings: these wings definitely are delicious. Deep fried and then tossed in a combination of caramelized fish sauce and garlic. I can't believe something so simple can be so damn good. The wings are a bit on the spicy side but nothing unbearable at least to me. The meat in the wings were succulent and not dry which was a good thing. You can't really taste the \\"fish\\" from the sauce so if you're not a fan of seafood, these wings would be a good thing to get! My friend who doesn't eat seafood loved these wings. I loved the Cu Car (pickled vegetables -- Daikon and Carrots) they give you on the side. It definitely cools down your tongue from the heat of the wings. I loved them but not as much as my Kung Op Wu Sen. I would order this again, for sure. Overall, Pok Pok, you definitely have another fan. I do think the food here is downright flavorful and has kept to the traditional Thai cooking with an influence of Chinese, but the prices here are a bit on the expensive side but being a tourist I did not mind forking over the money."},{"name":"MOOYAH Burgers, Fries & Shakes","address":"199 Boston Rd, Ste 8","city":"North Billerica","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is always so good!

I was having one of those days, \\"Me WANT Pad Thai, NOW!\\"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place because of the good reviews and it being one of the only places open early afternoon on a Sunday.As soon has we walked in we were greeted with a bow from our server/host. He was the most friendliest server in the world. He gave us our menus, and we contemplated on our drinks. Our server could tell that I was having a hard time deciding so he offered a taste sample of the plum juice. It was way to sweet for me so we decided to order the thai iced tea. The iced tea was SOOO delicious. I was very unenthused when my boyfriend ordered the ice tea because I know how sweet the ones in the grocery store are. These ones however, tasted like they were prepared from real tea, cooled, and only slightly sweetened. It looked like  a tad of coconut cream was added at the bottom of the glass, which added a nice kick!We started our meal with an order of chicken/pork satays. The chicken satay was the best I have ever had, so juicy! The pork was good, but nothing special.For the entrees, we  ordered the pad thai (of course), and the duck curry. The pad thai was fantastic, the best I have ever had in a restaurant; it satisfied my cravings completely. The combination of spicey, sweet, sour, and salty was bang on. The duck curry had huge chunk of lychee and pineapple. The sauce was not overly sweet. The flavour of the lychee and the pineapple complimented the duck and the red curry paste wonderfully!We were too full for dessert by the end, but they all looked very delicious! A tad too expensive, however...This place was awesome :') I am so happy I came here today.

When we walked in, I tried to read the menu but this proved to be almost impossible unless standing right under it. The person taking our order seemed incredibly annoyed with us. My girlfriend ordered a gluten free pizza, which was met with a scoff. She has celiac disease and this was incredibly off putting. I ordered a custom pizza of sauce, cheese, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. We also got a fountain drink to split. Our total including reasonable tip came out to about 35 dollars. I am all for supporting small local business, and love businesses that are sustainable and humane. However, when our pizzas arrived, I was beyond disappointed. My pizza was paper thin and soaked in grease. The fresh and ethically sourced veggies were sparse, to put it kindly. I had about 5 mushrooms on the whole pizza. It tasted mostly of oil. About halfway through my pizza I realized that there was no sauce at all on my pizza. My girlfriend said that her pizza was even more oily, as evidenced when she picked up her pizza and it was sitting in a pool of oil. Being someone who is as ethical and sustainable in my eating as possible, I know that ingredients can get expensive. However, I also know that charging 30 dollars for two pizzas and a small drink that are not even 12 inches, with essentially nothing on them is a little suspicious. I wish that the pizza was not grilled and soak in oil, that there were more (any) toppings, and that someone asking for a GF pizza was not met with contempt.

Great white house, with rocking chairs, stringed lights, I mean the atmosphere was great.  The concept was all there...but it's not a 4 star place. It's literally across the convention center, so it pulled in a lot of out of towners for convenience. It was packed and a good full 45 minute wait for just 2 people.  I think it would have been longer if we didn't go back in and ask why we were the only ones still waiting...I totally got the 'oh well we were gonna call you next' speech.Being the first restaurant that I ate at in Austin, that kinda set me back a little.  I travel enough to know that each city has their own level of 'customer service', but wow, it did not stop there. We had this waiter, didn't ask us how we were, if we needed help with the menu, had any questions...none of that.  We got a sloppy dude, a beer gut in our face, totally short and never around to refill our cups.  I basically got a 'whadda ya want' then a 'yer done?'  Wow.  Started in super cheery and hopeful that this was going to be an amazing experience, left thinking...should we have even tipped that 15%?Food was good, nothing amazing enough though for me to give specifics.  I did have a kick that the table starter was popcorn with chili pepper flakes instead of the typical bread.Moonshine has soo much potential to pull into the name, build a great theme and menu around it.  It really did have the potential to be a full 5 stars, but after the actual experience with service, then food just being good, it was just a 2 stars for me.  It would have been a 3 if the food at least wowed me.

It was pretty busy and we were asked if we had a reservation, but since it was just the two of us we were seated pretty quickly. I was a bit surprised that a restaurant that was as pricey as this one had the plastic menus. The prices are $15-$30 a dish, so it probably will not be a frequent visit for us. Our entrees came with a soup or salad, and we both ordered the Italian wedding soup of the day. The bread that we got came with a garlic butter that was super delicious! I wish I had saved it and brought it home. The soup bowls came in large portions and was very tasty as well, I could easily eat more. By the time we got to our meals though, we were both actually sorta full (since neither of us had lunch so I guess our stomachs were small) so we didn't really eat much. I had the pasta, and I saw a woman at the table next to us had a sauce that looked good which ended up being a lemon garlic sauce? So I decided to try that with sausage. Fianc√© got the chicken moretti. The noodles themselves were amazing, but we were so full.

Out of all the KR restaurants, I like how \\"secluded\\" this particular location is as it makes you feel like you are entering a whole new world as you pull up. This place is very classy and can have an intimate, yet business meeting vibe at the same time.Food/drink: Ordered the Lobster Fritters, 20 oz ribeye, a side of Lobster Mac and Cheese, and the Goat Cheese Creme Brulee to eat and a bottle of the Oberon Cabernet Sauvignon and an Old Fashioned to drink. The Lobster Fritters were fantastic! They were delectable, fried, flavorful morsels of lobster meat with no real breading to get in the way (heck yeah!). The Ribeye was soooo juicy and perfectly cooked to temperature with a nice crust around the outskirts. I liked the Creme Brulee and thought the goat cheese was a different, but nice twist on the flavors. The only dish that fell short was the Lobster Mac and Cheese, as it had a disappointing amount of lobster...like you literally had to dig around the bowl just to find a tiny piece of lobster meat instead of the larger chunks throughout that I'm used to at other steakhouses. The Oberon was a delicious Cab and I highly recommend it if you like one that is smooth and slightly fruit-forward. The Old Fashioned (OF) was a hot mess and it was clear that the bartender who was working was inexperienced as he was unfamiliar with how to make any of the classic cocktails I requested (the OF was the only one he \\"knew\\" how to make).However, I still give 4 stars because the rest of the meal made for another good dining experience at one of my preferred steakhouses in the city."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Having recently moved to Atlanta, so glad I found this awesome spot right on Piedmont Park!

This tasty burger was hearty and filling, with so much flavor that it just hit the roof! Of my mouth. - pickled veggies: I love pickles, and these weren't even that great. Also, you can't differentiate what awesome/rare/totally common veggie you're chomping on, yet they all have a beet-pink color.

I've made a few different types of vegan mac n cheez, to varying success - none all that great. This mac n cheez, in particular, was no better than some of my worst attempts.

A dive is a disreputable bar or dining establishment.  Truly, the Dish Dive is ridiculously small and dated.  There may have been five tables and a couple of barstools up at the counter.  Initially, one may wonder how an establishment so small could even stay in business.  Then you see the menu, and better yet, you see the grub that is leaving the cramped kitchen.  You may catch yourself disregarding that initial reaction with an understanding nod.  The Dish Dive has the goods.  There's love here.We arrived for a Sunday lunch.  The parking behind the building is as limited and cramped as the inside establishment.  We had to maneuver ever so carefully just to turn our car around in the already occupied lot.  We did manage to find parking about a block away, though we weren't certain that we would be allowed to.  Getting lucky, we were seated at the counter bar stools within about five minutes.  From the counter we were able to see into the tiny kitchen where two men labored to produce their culinary creations.  The menu had more items than the establishment had tables.  I estimated about a dozen items to choose from.  I honed in on the shakshuka, a staple dish of many northern Africa countries, that consists of poached eggs, tomato sauce, peppers, and onions (among other things).  In Dish Dive's interpretation, I identified the inclusion of okra in the tomato sauce.  The sauce had been ladled over a layer of sweet potato puree.  Crumbles of feta and a garnish of parsley topped the dish.  To the side, lightly toasted pita wedges were provided to mop up the bold and flavorful sauce.  Flawless execution.   Every ingredient was a voice in a choir, the many notes culminating in joyous harmony.  This must be what angels sound like.  Everything in balance.  Not too many flavors, not too few.My wife eyed the fried chicken sandwich, which was topped with mushroom gravy, long pickle slices, dressed arugula, and pickled red onion.  Or course, as always, we shared each other's dishes.  While not the best fried chicken ever, it certainly did the job, and the use of homemade pickles and mushroom gravy truly elevated the dish to another level that we weren't normally accustomed to.  Oh, the pickles! ... so good.Credit should be given for how two cooks in a kitchen could execute at such a high level and still take the time to plate the food with care to please the eye of hungry customers.

The first time I went to visit her, I insisted she take me there since she had previusly trashed (not really, I'm being a little dramatic here...) my precious Strand. Well, she was right. Powell's takes the cake, and is way better than Strand (even though I still love it.) Not only is it ginormous... its incredibly well organized and spread out so I don't feel like I'm doing the limbo as I walk through the aisles. They have a great selection of used books, and special edition, and gift editions- which are just so pretty to look at on a shelf. Not to mention, you can find some cheap books. And of course, because its in Portland, they have a great coffee shop too.I fantasize that if I ever lived in Portland, I would be there on the reg, reading books and drinking coffee.

Luckily, the meat were  well marinated, tasty, very tender and not dried (like medium or well). So I kept my order and not sent it back to the kitchen. My daughter enjoyed her turkey burger. She thought the dressing topping (cheddar cheese, avocado, red onion, lemon aioli and arugula) complimented well with the burger texture. Unfortunately, my son and I we were not too pleased with his order (pasta from the children's menu). Unlike most restaurants that serves this on their children's menu, unless it's being stated, it is normally served with spaghetti. Since it was not noted, we were surprised to see big spiral fusilli served over tomato sauce. It's our first time seeing it served this way. We eat out 5x/week.  For pasta lovers, the pasta type makes a difference between a yes or a no meal.  The thick spiral fusilli texture is just so different from the spaghetti. Overall, the expectation was way off and he did not enjoyed eating the fusilli pasta . I am very surprised it's not noted on the menu. If we knew, he would have ordered something else. Okay, so he proceeded with his side order (Jasmine rice), which white rice is something he loves. I was surprised to see he only took a bite, and not touch it again. His response, \\"it tastes weird\\". Guess it can be difficult for a 6 year old to say the white rice is flavored (unlike white rice which is normally served plain, the rice at this place is salted). I was also surprised the rice was not fully cooked and hard. So the flavored salted rice (again not noted on the menu) and the hard texture (uncooked rice) made it \\"tastes weird.  By then, I had to bring it to a manager's attention. The manager (later on learned his name is Mike Chan) volunteered to replace it for a new one. He even comp my son's meal (saw it on the bill). Overall, I was very pleased with his great service and prompt attention. Five mins went by, after the waitress placed the bill on our table, I informed the waitress we still have not gotten my son's dessert, the apple slices. Another 5mins went by, by then 6:30, the restaurant became overcrowded with people standing everywhere by the bar (next to our table) and at the front waiting area squeezing in. Our waitress was hard to be spotted and nothing I could do but wait. It made the atmosphere uncomfortable cuz people were standing everywhere. By then, I just wanted to leave. To speed up my son's dessert, I went up to the food counter myself and asked to check on my son's apple slices. The guy pointed to the food computer (10:54) perhaps meaning 10mins and 54 seconds). Luckily, he informed the kitchen to get the apple slices. In seeing the restaurant being overcrowded, and felt closet phobic,we asked to pack the apple slices to go. Overall the food is good. I thought they can do a better job with the food description. That alone, ruined my son's meal. With the manager's prompt attention and great service, I have to come back to see Mike again and give this place a second chance."},{"name":"Casa Arandinas","address":"9001 Brodie Ln, Ste A3","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I just have to say that we are huge Arandinas' fans having been to the one on Wm.

But alas, I am here to rate the bubble tea (and chicken nuggets).After my first visit, I was ready to give ViVi 3 stars but I read through the 4- and 5-star reviews and decided that before I handed my final verdict, I would return to try the tea once more. The first time, I ordered for myself the matcha milk tea with 30% sugar, less ice, and boba; while I got AT his usual (from next-door competitor) grapefruit green tea with the same modifications as mine. For giggles, I got the mild popcorn chicken because Taiwanese chicken nuggets are seriously the best ever. I was the only person in the shop at the time and my order took about 5 minutes to come out, with the drinks ready first. I sipped mine right away, because I have a problem waiting to drink my bubble tea. It was gone before I got home but I handed AT the nuggets and tea. I thought the matcha was decent, though there was that powdery quality that Rachel K. talked about. I didn't love the bubbles. They were cooked well (not too mushy or hard) but the size and taste weren't as good as my favorite bubble tea place a few doors down. Way inferior, in my opinion. The syrup or whatever ViVi soaks in the tapioca pearls in is less sweet and just generally less tasty.AT and I dug into the popcorn chicken and enjoyed them. The problem is later... He got serious heartburn and general stomach upset and was quite sure it was from the chicken. Luckily for me, with my digestive system of steel, I suffered no ill consequences, so I don't think we can chalk up his upset belly to food poisoning. More like really greasy nuggets. His tea was a huge fail and he ended up throwing out most of it! I took a sip before he dumped it, to see if he was exaggerating, haha. He complained of the flavor being artificial and too sweet, despite my request for 30% sugar. He was absolutely right. The taste is not that of fresh grapefruit with the usual tart and bitter brightness.Anyway, on my second visit, I did a side-by-side comparison. I went to the bubble tea joint in the shopping plaza adjacent to the one that ViVi is in first and did the terrible thing of putting my large Golden Oolong Milk Tea with no sugar, less ice, and boba in the car and walking over to ViVi. I felt I was sort of entitled to do this, since I did buy something and was only going to ViVi to pick something up and get back to my car to leave. I wasn't going to occupy my parking spot for more than 15 minutes total. I got a medium Bubble Milk Black Tea with 30% sugar (remembering from my first visit that the boba is less sweet), less ice, and boba. I admit, I wasn't doing a true apples-to-apples test, but who gives a crap. There isn't an oolong equivalent at ViVi. I drank my Bubble Milk Black Tea right away. Right away. Which my oolong mlik tea was sitting in the car, with the ice making my boba firm. I got to the car as I was sipping and immediately stabbed the top of the other cup with the boba straw and took a sip. Ahhh, my top bubble tea of all time and space. I went back and forth. My favorite bubble tea place's boba had gotten a bit firmer than how I typically experience them but they still were pleasantly chewy and the flavor AND size are just SPOT-ON. The tea with no sugar is delicious. So I won't recount to you the whole sipping one then the other. Suffice it to say, ViVi did not win, even though I left the first drink to wait as I walked to ViVi and bought the tea and drank that one right away.I came home and AT finished my Bubble Milk Black Tea and said it was actually decent, much better than the Grapefruit Green Tea that he'd gotten. But even so, his favorite joints are KFT and Formosa and we are not likely to hurry back to ViVi... Maybe to meet friends who want to go there but not on our own. There are way too many competitors in the bubble tea space, especially on BuHi. It's going to be interesting to see how they all duke it out.Note that I didn't even complain about the parking situation. It is sort of a \\"it is what it is\\" (I hate this saying, by the way), so I don't even factor that into the rating. Likewise, I am not swayed in the slightest by cutesy or gimmicky stuff. If I took both of these into account, I suppose they'd cancel each other out, leaving my rating just as it is.[#Yelp365: 51/365]"},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My food wasn't bad; but my friend's food looked as if it was sitting out and premade sushi.

Save your money and make pancakes at home with your friends and family.  Even batter from a box or a mix is as-good as slapping cakes.  So in detail:  the prices are too high for what you get.  $3.50 for two pieces of not-very-good bacon.  The \\"savory cakes\\" were really not good, the jalape√±os were poor quality and not a good match for the cake.  The batter choices for the do-it-yourself were very limited - I would have expected way more batter choices.  Where is the sourdough or buckwheat batter?  Why no crepe or German-style batters?  The high spot of the meal was the loaded potatoes.  The staff was fairly friendly, but they are very full of themselves - they act like because the place is popular that they are somehow more special than any of the myriads of good breakfast places in Portland.

We started with the house Ceviche, I have to say it was pretty underwhelming.  It tasted ok, but, shrimp had a slight seafood taste, anyone who makes Ceviche knows the best shrimp is shrimp with absolute no smell or fishy taste.  In addition, the red onions took away from the crisp lime flavor.  If you are going to use red onions, must make sure they have marinated for a while.For entree we had the Rabo de toro, gambas bravas, caracoles a la vas a, albondigas, and Almejas el faro.  The gambas bravas were my favorite the shrimp was perfectly crispy and mixed in mayonnaise and chili.  The caracoles was served in a tomato sauce on top of a pastry, the pastry was good but the tomato sauce was underwhelming.  The albondigas, which is a meatball, made up of veal, beef, and chorizo.  Again the tomato sauce was a little underwhelming almost like they do not use red wine in their sauce.  The Rabo de toro, was my second favorite, this was a nice ox tail, very tender, cooked in a nice sauce.  The Almejas de faro was good, enjoyed the little necks, but again the tomato sauce that was served with the clams was underwhelming.  The sangria, was just ok although the half a pitcher was a nice size.  I do like the fact you can order a whole or tapas portion depending on how much you like the dish.

However, the menu is written by an American so you actually understand what you're ordering. Further, menu options aren't simply well-known thai staples that litter all Thai restaurants in America. Many of them have stories behind their recipes and detail the villages (and people) who created them. I definitely appreciated that cultural flavor. The food itself spanned from good to great. Some items are fairly bland while others had a greatly medley of flavors. I wasn't crazy about any dish in particular but I really enjoyed the traditional aspect of it. That's a pretty rare commodity in the States these days. Like I said in my tip, I wouldn't come here often but I would definitely come back.Besides the food, the business/service is worth noting. I was with a fairly large party (6 people) so the wait was over an hour. They're smart business people - you can go wait at the Whiskey Soda Lounge and they'll radio over when your table is ready. WSL has the same menu items (just less variety) and isn't terribly crowded. When you sit down, you just give your Pok Pok ticket to the waiter and they'll let you know when your table is ready. As for decor,  it appears to be a bit rundown. Few things in Portland (or on the east side) are super clean or look brand-spankin' new so I certainly wasn't surprised or put off by it.

I didn't protest at all, but simply left as told. Minutes later I returned to ask for the owners contact information and instead of being given what I asked for, I was shouted at across a bar by a woman who was not even witness to what happened the week prior and had no knowledge or connection to it, but for some reason harbored a great deal of hostility towards someone she had never even met. When she finally agreed to show me to the owner she proceeded to berate me in front of a crowd of customers. The owner then came out and we had a discussion about what had occurred and how I felt I was being unfairly turned away. She explained to me that I was being turned away because the follow week as I left I remarked that \\"I am going to leave a shitty review.\\" After apologizing for the use of foul language she continued to refuse service or to apologize for the way I was treated by her staff yet again.

I ordered vegetable and bulgogi bim bim bap, which must be the national dish of Korea, as it is very tasty and easy to make! Bim bim bap is a Korean dish with many layers served in a large ceramic, stone or metal bowl, it can be served hot or cold. The first layer is freshly steamed rice, and on top of that steamed or raw vegetables thinly sliced and arranged in small groups in a circular pattern, on top of the veggies. Meat, tofu, or fish will be placed atop the vegetables, and then on top of that as a garnish sesame seeds, seaweed strips, or even a raw or fried egg will be placed. I ordered mine hot with golgi (beef), and it came in a still sizzling stone bowl which kept cooking the rice at the bottom of the bowl to yummy nutty flavor. The dish was simple and excellent! Also, as was typical for most restaurants I encountered in Korea our dishes were served with various accompaniments including: marinated black beans, two styles of kimchi, marinated bok choy, saut√©ed tofu, and cellophane noodles.

Now, to most people over here, Chinese food is honeyed walnut shrimp and other bizarre concoctions.Similarly, most people over here assume Thai food is eaten with chopsticks (IT IS NOT!!!!), and is your usual phad thai and other basics.This place does a great job of presenting pretty authentic stuff... from the food right down to the silverware and umbrellas (all made in Thailand)."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I come here because my friend's recommendation.

It feels like a place that has done so well, that it's outgrown its original size. The wait was about 30 minutes, which isn't too bad for a Sunday evening (~7 PM). Once inside, we could smell the unique Thai aromas. This is not your average Thai food - nothing on the menu is the same as that of a typical restaurant. If you're alarmed at the price, realize that you're not getting Pad Thai from a run of the mill spot. It's not even that pricey, and come on, there's no taxes in Portland! Highlights:Wings - Spicy, tangy and cooked perfectly. They were bathed in the nectar of the Gods and fell down from heaven. Hands down, best coated wings I've had.Kung Op Wun Sen - say it three times fast....do it! I've never had bean thread noodles with so much flavor.

After another 20 minutes we started talking about how long the food was taking for it being so slow. The table next to us, while they came 20 minutes after us got their food before we did. In fact, they got THEIR CHECK before our food even came out. So, it took an hour and fifteen minutes for a egg salad sandwich and a waffle. Nothing complicated.I've never sent any food back in my life, but the egg salad sandwich was not edible. Small chunks of egg with some sort of soupy mayo mixture that was nasty.My gf's waffle was cold and dry and terrible tasting.At this point I was really seething because we had spent 90 minutes for terrible food and the server made no apologies for how incredibly long the brunch had been.So, overall, a terribly long wait made worse by other tables able to come and eat in half the time.

I was amused by the bad Romanian deep house being played and the books lining the benches advertising a sunny lifestyle in--uh--Boston, but in the end I was charmed.It's always hard to justify paying $10+ for an a√ßa√≠ bowl when they can be so easily made at home, but Energize definitely puts in the extra effort to stand out. First of all, their a√ßa√≠ blend is a lot creamier than average. It may not be to everyone's preference, but if you're looking for a meal replacement the bowl was a lot more filling than I expected. All of the ingredients were very fresh and generously topped. I asked for extra granola and coconut flakes and you literally could not see the rest of the bowl since they were piled on so high. For me that's a huge plus. Best of all though, the bowls come out in frozen metal dishes, which means the a√ßa√≠ stayed firm and chilled from the first delicious bite to the last.I would definitely come back to try some of their other options, and while the prices are on the high side the options for healthy dining in this neighborhood are sorely limited.

When they finally realized how to make an iced London fog, my friend apologized for using a different name, but the cashier gave her a rude face. My other friend ordered a cortado, and his cashier had to explain what a cortado was to the barista, which is understandable because not all places make them. The barista let the espresso sit too long and expire before pouring in the steamed cream. Which made his cortado bitter.

Online shows hours of operation from 8 AM to 3 PM. Painted sign in window shows 8 AM to 2 PM EVERYDAY. We walked through the door at precisely 1:46 PM and were told by the laziest female hostess whose name I wish I had asked that they were closed and no longer seating. They were obviously not closed given the number of people still eating, and the abundance of open tables. At first I accepted her answer, only to walk outside and watch an individual walk in, speak to the exact same lazy hostess, and be seated. Literally within seconds of refusing me. I walked back in and mentioned that the sign outside indicates 8 AM to 2 PM everyday. She then explained to me that seating ends at 1:45 and the kitchen closes at 2. Even if her absurd excuse we're correct, it's the epitome of unprofessional to turn someone away within one minute of the alleged closing time. As someone who has experience working in the restaurant industry, I would not tolerate that kind of behavior towards any customers, let alone loyal, repeat customers.

I'm a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member. Been so for years. So I know my Marriotts. This JW property feels a little like a cross between the Marriott Vacation Club and JW brands. It doesn't have that typical feel of exclusivity like the usual JW properties. I'm sure it has something to do with the Orlando location. I'm not a fan of the Marriott Vacation Club brand and when I pay JW money and end up getting a Disney family vacation feel...it doesn't make me very happy.Here are a few of the issues. Self-parking is $28 daily. That's right. $28 and you're not even in a downtown location. It's just a resort property with a massive parking lot (lots of swamp, I mean land in Central Florida). Ends up being about a 5-minute walk from your car to the entrance if you park way out along the perimeter. Marriott needs to start rethinking how it handles parking fees for Gold and Platinum members. It's ridiculous that we have to pay for parking despite our brand loyalty. At a minimum, parking should be discounted.The resort fee is $35 per day. When I checked in the guest relations lady informed me that as a Platinum member I would be receiving a $5 per day discount. What an insult. Either radically reduce the fee, waive it altogether, or simply don't make the effort. Taking $5 off is offensive. And if Marriott is reading this...take note...your site says the resort fee includes \\"in-room Internet.\\" Well, as a Platinum member, I get the Internet for free wherever I stay. And that can be as much as $20+. So big deal. Some of these resort properties are notorious for playing the \\"teaser rate\\" scam. They will advertise incredibly low room rates. But when you add the parking and resort fees, you're back to a really expensive nightly rate. And we all know the resort fee is generally a nonsense fee that hotels include to generate more revenue. The fee typically includes services few people will use.The first night we had an issue with the electrical system in the sleeping area. My lamp didn't work, then came on by itself at 3 am. The reading light didn't work for both my girlfriend and I. The maintenance guy came to look at it that night and said he'd come back the following day to fix it. He was very nice but I must say his hygiene was nasty. He smelled very badly. The next day no one came to fix it so we had to ask the front desk once again. Finally, someone fixed the wiring. They actually had to remove the headboard of the bed.Upon checkout, as I usually do when a thing or two doesn't go well, I voiced my concerns. I doubt it ever goes anywhere. I'm just a number along with hundreds and thousands of other guests.There was a really positive side though. We stopped in the restaurant to ask about where to get the smoothies on the in-room menu. We just wanted some smoothies to walk around the property with. The man working there went away, far away, to find out how to make them and brought them back to us free of charge. He should be running the property. He was accommodating, attentive and empathetic. That's what keeps people coming back at $200+ per night.Overall, it's a nice family-oriented property with a lazy river and giant pool area. There's even a vegetable garden. You can walk to the adjacent Ritz-Carlton and explore their offerings. There are also many activities to sign up for. The property rents bikes and conducts a river kayaking trip on a creek next to the property.It was nice, but it feels more like a high-end Marriott Vacation Club Resort. And since I don't like those anyway, I can't say it's a place I'd come back to."},{"name":"Kasbah Moroccan Cafe","address":"201 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The food was great!

Their curries are perfectly seasoned and full of flavor. There's always a good mix of textures, with a good balance of veggies and meat. I especially loved their Tom Kha Gai coconut chicken soup, which I haven't been able to find a great replica of since leaving Thailand. This one did the trick. Their food is always quite fresh and with the right balance of flavours. And everything is quite reasonably priced, with great lunch specials. The place is small and cute, with a nice clean atmosphere. The service is also very friendly and attentive. It can be slightly slow when they are short staffed. My only other gripe with the place would be that sometimes it seems to be randomly closed when I've come by for lunch or dinner.

As for the clam chowder, i really enjoyed it, it was not so creamy as the usual suspects are, but a little spicy -- which I prefer, no Tabasco needed in this bowl! The lobster (lobsta, tee-hee) roll was good and comes with a side of coleslaw and homemade kettle chips.  My cousin ordered the sea bass, it was served on a bed of barley and carrot mix.  Dessert was also delicious, a choice of sorbets, cakes and pastries.  The server was attentive, the ambiance clean and sophisticated -- also good to note that it wasn't too noisy in there so you can have a good dinner conversation and hear your party without having to shout across the table.

I used to live in Decatur for 6-7 yeas and this place never changed.  It had the same number of people, crowded but not too crowded.  They were always a mix of MILFs, Emory students, hippies, butch lesbians, and Marta travelers.  But I am not judging.  Java Monkey is just the right size, split into three areas.  There is the entrance way, for the hardcore laptop junkies. It features a bar-stool bar area where you can set your laptop and face the wall so you don't have to look at people.   And a couple of couches.Then there is the Wine bar area.  The Wine bar is OK for their regular wine tastings.  It is a little too small for me, but quaint.  Then there is the back patio, area.  It is kind of a mix of patio and restaurant so you don't normally have to worry about rain.This place is part coffee shop, part wine bar, part spoken word poetry underground community, part restaurant.  The coffee is organic?  tastes good but nothing too special.  I am a fan of the Americanos, priced at over $2.  And the other coffees are all kind of priced over $2.  They serve coffee bar food.  They have hummus and sandwiches.  The food is good, but I don't they they prepare it.  It seems that they just microwave but I could be wrong about this.They used to (or maybe still do) have a spoken word even on Sunday.  It is powerful.  People come in from all over the Atlanta area and crowd the patio.  It was a mix of poetry, rhymes, guitar.  With spoken word and the patio area being so nice, it is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.Java Monkey is your standard go to place in Decatur, for coffee or wine or just relaxing the patio.  Oh yea, the wifi is top-notch."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"12103 Collegiate Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Absolutely terrible.

I'd never been to the restaurant before and, to be honest I (surprisingly) didn't even know it existed until she mentioned that's where they all wanted to go one night. No idea how I'd never heard of it beforehand, but once we got there, the 1-2 hour waiting list to be seated made me quickly realize just how popular this place really is. To kill our wait time, we headed over to the Whiskey Soda Lounge just across the street for drinks and an order of the infamous chicken wings. SO. GOOD. I had never had anything like them before - salty, with a bit of a tang and a nice light dose of spice. (My friend and I opted for the mild version.) Yes, at $13 for 6 wings they may be a little pricey to some. But to play the devil's advocate, it's not like they're giving you tiny, skimpy little wings like you envision getting from most restaurants; these were some of the biggest chicken wings I've seen, in my opinion. For a drink I chose to get the Apple Gin Rickey. I'm more of a sweet, fruity-flavored drink fan, and seeing as they don't have all the typical liquors I was used to being able to choose from at other bars, this seemed like the one that would most fit under that category. Refreshing and sweet - though not overpoweringly so - it definitely did not disappoint. For dinner once we finally were seated at Pok Pok, being both a seafood and noodle/pasta lover, I ended up ordering the Cha Ca \\"La Vong,\\" which is, to quote the menu: \\"Catfish marinated in tumeric and sour rice, friend in tumeric oil with scallions and dill, served on rice vermicelli with peanuts, mint, cilantro and mam nem.\\" I opted to hold the peanuts, just because I'm not a fan of them. The dish was delicious and light, all the flavors blended well. The only thing I didn't realize was that the vermicelli noodles served with it are cool to lukewarm temperature at most. I would have preferred them to be hot (which I know probably isn't the traditional way to serve it), but that's just my taste. I definitely will be back, with plans of ordering the boar collar meat dish upon my return!"},{"name":"Hakata Ramen","address":"673 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid 4 stars for ramen.

I get lost and distracted easily, and can wander in here for hours and be perfectly content. Although the sections are well labeled and color coded, which makes it so I don't get lost quite as easily. I also make sure our phones are charged so my husband and I can call each other in the store. The store is three stories tall and takes up an entire city block. The staff are always super nice. They are helpful, but not annoying. You have to ask them for help, which is just fine with me. I like the adventure of getting lost in here and finding new reading material. That's half the fun in my opinion. But when I do need something, the staff are always happy to help. In addition to books they have planners, calendars, puzzle books, Nalgene bottles, randomly cool gifts, sketchbooks. I love coming in near the holidays and just puttering in the gift section. I find really fun things for my 8 year old nephew and my sister in-law, who is a teacher. I love Powell's. The smell of books, the wide variety of books.

The wings were overcooked and tough, as we're the prawns, and all dishes containing pork or pork belly were either undercooked or extremely fatty.

Whiskey Soda Lounge was down the street, and that seems to be the go-to place when you have to wait at Pok Pok, as Pok Pok and WSL are owned by the same people (?). 45 min-1hr passes and we check back in, and we are seated. The ambiance is unique, in that it's not your typical restaurant affair. Almost like a picnic table under heated lamps kinda vibe. We had two orders of their signature Fish Sauce Wing's, and a couple of other dishes that were good, but I will dive specifically at the wing's cause .. tbh I don't remember what else we ate. lul. Upon arrival, it looked amazing. A nicely battered wing, a shiny glaze of thick sauce, and you can see the spices right on the wing. Now I'm about to grab the wing with care cause I'm fully expecting my fingers to be roasted cause shit finna be hot. NOPE. The wing was disappointingly room temperature - kinda like that room temperature when you order a box of pizza two days before and theres that one single slice in the box that's been chilling. That kind of room temperature. I think the cooler-temperature wings kind of ruined the experience for me, but if you do believe in second chances then I guess this is that time. I'm hoping the next time I come back the wings will be hot, and that finding parking won't be a pain in the booty hole."},{"name":"Allston Diner","address":"431 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place.

I appreciated at the Valet guys told me that before I considered leaving my car that a wedding party was taking 1/2 the venue and that meant longer waits.In total, I actually waited 2 hrs for a table for 14.  Why? Well, even though they knew about my party, some idiots decided to continue talking and sitting at their table 1+ hour after they had checked out.  The host staff would take a look inside once and awhile, but my group eventually got moved to the back patio in the end.When it came time to order, I got the Green Chile Chicken Mac and Cheese.  It was a good size portion.  I wish there was more of . . . well everything - more kick, more chicken, more cheese.  The appetizer of the Corn Dog Shrimp was exactly what it sounded like - a skewered shrimp, batter dipped and fried.  I was kind of disappointed that there was not more creativity.Our server was alright.  He never introduced himself.  It was just standard.  To give you an idea of how late it took us to be seated - the valet guys came to us and had us cash out with them as they'd leave our cars sitting out front.  When the bill came, I was disappointed to say that even a \\"b-day dessert\\" had a charge of $5.I know this is place has to have higher prices to pay for the property and all, but really - we had plenty of drinks while we waited and you still charge for a b-day dessert . . .___I've had better experiences with smaller crowds at their brunch.  I'm not sure I could say that I would put this place any higher than my list of \\"only if other people insist on going.\\"_____**EDIT A few days after this review, the business manager wrote me an email, apologized and mailed me some giftcards.

Bloody Mary was exceptional. Members of my party enjoyed the Hand Model and a gin based drink. Buck a shuck oysters, but the oysters varied wildly in size. I ate a giant one that was much larger than two tiny ones we also received. The interior has a minimalist, upscale barn aesthetic. The chairs are Belgian school chairs, according to their website. My boyfriend found them very uncomfortable- he is a tall, slim, bony guy. Anyone with a large frame, carrying extra weight, or perhaps older folks would probably dislike them.Food: my table ordered chicken and biscuits, eggs Benedict's, bagel with lox, a ginormous sticky bun, and grilled cornbread to start. All the food was very tasty-no one was disappointed. The portions were also very huge. The prices were not unreasonable but I would MUCH rather pay a dollar less and get two thirds the amount of food. Not a single person was able to finish their meal. And here is where I explain giving Commonwealth a 3 star rating instead of 4...When we were all defeated by the massive quantity of food, one couple asked that their leftovers be boxed together and my boyfriend and I (who had split the awesome chicken and waffles) asked for our almost untouched sticky bun to be boxed up too. The waiter returned and gave us a bag which he said contained the sticky bun and handed my friend's boyfriend the other bag. It was only discovered the following morning that they had been mixed up by the staff. We had to throw out the food we received because we left it on our counter overnight thinking it was the bun. It was the saddest thing to happen to me before 9 am in a long time. I might come back to Commonwealth eventually, but I have a feeling it will be to sit at the bar instead. And to split one meal instead of ordering two.

Twenty minutes to be greeted by the waitress and have the order taken. Thirty additional minutes for tea, coffee, and pie to arrive. Ten more minutes for the check. Then the waitress apparently didn't want to get paid, because she never came back. After another twenty minutes of my shredding napkins in anger because I wanted to leave, we paid at the bakery counter, with no question or care as to why we took our restaurant check over there.

I don't think any server has ever said that to me before.My buffalo meatloaf was humongous and seasoned really well, and they didn't skimp on the mushroom sauce. I had a side of griddled polenta, which was interesting, but had a tomato sauce on it and didn't really match very well with the meatloaf. I gotta say that the \\"seasonal vegetables\\" that are always served with the entrees never change. It's not that they aren't cooked well, but I'd like to have something other than carrots and zucchini for once. The cocktails here are quite good, I love the Ruby Slipper, a potent mixture of grapefruit juice, vodka, and champagne.

I grew-up here and I am a proud, life-long member of the \\"Meat and Potato Guys of America.\\" However, I have been around the world enough to have been exposed to other cultures and foods. German, Italian, French, Middle-Eastern, and other cuisines, now round-out my culinary repertoire.I have always \\"liked\\" Mexican food, but I have to admit that during my first 30 years or so on planet Earth my experience was typically  pedestrian.

It was suitable for a late night fast-food pit stop after the party, and that's about it.Living in Tucson, Arizona for the past 15 years though, was a revelation. There, I cultivated a love-affair with fresh, authentic, slap-me-I-can't-stop-laughing, crazy-good, real-deal Mexican food.

The chef (who has not been there on any of my 10 or so previous visits) is a big sweaty guy with a very bad attitude. This is a small place and anything the chef says will be heard by the whole room. When we approached our table he complained and grunted \\"I wish you were more than 3, this way one seat will be empty\\" or something like that. I didn't know what to say... After we sat down we realized that the chef was wearing earplugs (we understand why!). Since he couldn't hear a thing in there, he didn't know how much noise he was making. He hit every pot and pan with his metal tools so hard that me and my friend startled and had to cover our ears during the entire meal. The banging was crazy loud. I live in the city and use the green line every day so I am surrounded by noise all the time. This, however, was something beyond anything I have experienced. The bad part is that he was banging the metal dishes and tools in an angry manner, as if he was mad and wanted to give everyone a hard time; behaving like a 3-year-old. The service was very slow this night but the guy who served us was nice and brought us everything we needed. The sad part is that the chef was yelling at the waiter and the yelling and banging made it very unpleasant. It doesn't end there. The busboy was making an incredible noise by throwing metal dishes against each other. I guess that is why the chef was wearing earplugs in the first place..... The noise from the busboy was constant and only during a couple of seconds here and there it was quiet. When it got quiet in the room, it was evident that nobody was talking in there. It was just not possible to have a conversation. In combination with the crazy busboy and chef, some very high energy classical music was playing in loudspeakers in the room. When it finally got quiet for a couple of seconds, the music would underline the stress and anxiety of this place. I saw people turning their heads towards the chef the entire time during the meal, trying to figure out what on earth he was doing! In summary, the food is OK here but the dining experience is horrible. I used to love this place for its atmosphere but now it is run by people who seem to hate their customers.

They took a $50 deposit from me.  3 days before the event I, let me repeat...I figured out that they had \\"double booked\\" the space.  Whoops.  After one of the managers called me to try and tell me it was my fault for increasing my number of guests from 40 to 50, and then telling me that the person who took my reservation was \\"not authorized to take event space reservations\\", I started to get a little angry.  But I kept my cool.  I took time out of my days, every day until the event, to go into the restaurant to try and get a \\"plan\\" put into place so that when my guests arrived I could tell them where they were going.  The management was all very nice - once they realized I wasn't going away...they kept apologizing that they had made the mistake, but still no solid plan in place.It wasn't until the day of my event that the other party called to say that they would be gone in time.  Thank goodness.  But, I still did not appreciate the undue stress that this caused in my week.  I'm sure they'll try and make the party extra special...maybe even buy me a pizza, right?  Wrong.Cue the party = 1 surly server + 50 people + stairs.  Bad combination.  I'm gonna skip the rest of the details, but after I had to leave my party to find management to get some more service, I was done. Due to the unprofessionalism of this venue I did not have a good time before, during or after my event.  I did not receive any consolation for my added week of stress and I am still bitter about why this all happened.  My guests were treated badly by the server and this left a bad taste in not only mine, but 49 other customer's mouths as well.I've worked in the industry for years.  If you fuck up, you've gotta make it right.  If I were the manager at this place I would have been out there serving, making it right.  The management at Old Town Pizza did not.  Instead, they gave me some lip service and (barely) staffed their Friday event with a server who did not want to be there.

Wished we had better portion sizes for all the dishes. We got the Laap Pet Isaan, which is a chopped duck salad, and it tasted like it had been just covered with dried chile and was so spicy it was inedible. Our party of three, all with varying degrees for spice tolerance, agreed that it was too much and we sent it back.

Was my favorite part of the whole trip! The tour guide, Carlos, was so knowledgable and was just a great way to spend the afternoon.\\n- To save some money on food, there is a Walgreen's within walking distance and there is a small bodega on the first floor. You can also pick up tubes for the pool at Walgreens.\\n- The lobby lounge at the JW is a lot of fun at night. You can bring your own beers and sit on the balcony around the bonfire.

The place is cute, rustic in decor and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. Two examples: (1) upon entering, I was a little overwhelmed by the busy pace and not really sure what to do or how and what to order (more on that in a minute.) The server behind the counter was kind, helpful and patient--far more so than the guy in line behind me. (2) The husband was seated, realized he needed a bottle cap opener and stood up to get it. An employee who just happened to be passing by overheard, grabbed the bottle and said cheerily, \\"I'll take care of that for you.\\" The husband was so surprised he questioned the employee to ensure he was opening the bottle, not throwing it in the trash. haha. So you walk in and get in line. Coolers with beer (I think it was beer), soda and water line the queue. At the end of the line is a cooler with cold pasta and macaroni salads and desserts. You must get your drinks and cold sides here before you get to the register. Hot sides (potatoes, beans) can be ordered at the counter. The menu is very limited. Meats (brisket, moist brisket, ribs, poultry, a few hot and cold sides, no vegetables that I saw, and one or two desserts.) The suggested serving is a half a pound and comes with bread (I think you can get a roll, too? I saw it on someone's tray, but not sure where he got it from.) It was too much, I couldn't finish it. While the brisket was tasty and tender, I wasn't blown away. The meal just felt heavy, plain and calorie-laden. I added BBQ sauce for flavor, but I prefer a sweeter sauce than this was. And at $37 for lunch (for 2), I was disappointed. While the whole place is bustling, once you get your food and sit down, you calm down a bit.

I came in a group of five and ordered about six main items to share amongst the group, as the type of dining here is communal. It was smaller proportions than I thought, but it was surprisingly filling. So don't let the visual size of the meals affect your judgement when you order. You can always refer to the professional recommendations of the staff, which i did refer too. With the amount of food that we ordered it was as filling as i thought it would be from eating eight items form the menue.  We order ended up ordering a double order of Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (6 wings) and Kaeng Dawk Kalam.the other four items we order was the Tam Kai Yaang, Muu Paa Kham Waan, Sunny's Yam Wun Sen Chao Wang, and my favorite Sai Ua Samun Phrai, the spiciness of the meat pair well with the sticky rice that included in this dish and greens on lice to help cool your mouth down.If i were to visit Portland again, I would definitely come here again. But for all you foodies out there i would definitely add this to your list of places to go.  What my recommendations are, i don't because all the items in which i had were delicious and best serve to groups of people, as it makes a good bonding experiance.If i could done this experience over again, I would have ordered at least 8 items in one sitting.

Not knowing any Good sushi spots downtown I left it up to Yelp to lead the way. Our party of 8 included a sous chef friend that is VERY opinionated when it comes to good food. As we walked in I could see the skepticism written all over his face which was confirmed with his comment \\"there aren't any asians IN this place\\".  I did not want the guilt of choosing a bad place for our buddy who flew 18+ Hours to see us from the other side of the world... I silently started to panic.Our server was friendly but didn't really have a clue. We painfully watched her open two bottles of wine for our table, which looked like something she had never done before. When she was done, it looked like somebody had chewed the top off. It really was hard to watch, but humorous at the same time. Some starters that were ordered: Caesar Japonais (me), Avo-Tuna Ceviche (husband) and the Gyoza (sous chef). First of all, the Caesar Japonais was Ridiculously Good and a bargain at $5.50. Large pieces of beautifully smoked salmon, soft cooked egg on top... I can't imagine how big the large portion is. I didn't try the Avo-Tuna, but my husband wasn't impressed. He was jealous he didn't get he Caesar. \\nThe Gyoza portions were also HUGE and SO good! Most of our table ordered sushi (chef's choice). The sous chef and I decide to do the Ramen. He did the Shoyu Ramen and I did the Miso Ramen. Although my Miso ramen was good, the Shoyu Ramen broth was more my style. Next time. Our Sous Chef buddy commented that the housemade noodles were some of the best he's had in Portland. While he inhaled his ramen, my husband and I pointed out the 6 tables that had finished their meals and walked past us were ALL asian. Ha! The sushi was decent, but definitely not the highlight of their menu. I wouldn't hesistate to order sushi here, but I wouldn't come here strictly for the sushi.Overall: Service is a bit sketchy, the table set ups are cool, they need coat hangers. Caesar Japonais, Gyoza and Shoyu Ramen would be my ideal meal here again.I get the thumbs up from the group and I mentally thank Yelp!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Full disclosure; I haven't even eaten there yet, but therein lies the problem.

The blasphemy gets worse: I LIKED it. I got the extra moist brisket, which is like smoky, peppery roast beef until you douse it in the sweet and spicy red sauce, when it takes on a whole new character and is unquestionably barbecue. I piled mine on the soft white bread that comes with the meal and it was nomilicious.I also got the \\"cream corn,\\" which made my inner grammarian balk, but I'm so glad I overrode her. Just looking at it made me gain three pants sizes, but it was creamy, buttery, corny, and so delicious that I could eat a tub full of the stuff. A BATHtub full. So yum.I was beyond stuffed, but I'm on vacation, and what are vacations about if not eating yourself sick? Besides, I'd gotten a diet soda. So I dug into some banana pudding, full of soggy 'Nilla wafers and bananas, just as good banana pudding should be. Gah.

They are always complete. Not so goodThe spice level is NEVER consistent. I have ordered food from here about 10 different times. Sometimes mild is unbearably hot and other times it has no flavor. I have yet to figure out how to order their food. I guess it just depends on the cook but it sucks to not know what you will get that day. I wish they had a consistent system for how much spice is in each level. \\nI also wish they would use more than one bag or had more sturdy bags. Carrying 5 orders back to my office in one bag takes both hands (top and bottom) and makes opening doors a bit risky.

Filled with excitement we decided to try it for lunch, but after my experience, I am very surprised the previous reviewers gave this restaurant such high scores. The place is small, painted in bright colors. Very hole in the wall, but clean and organized. Everything is served in disposable ware.  There is no complimentary chips and salsa at Senor Frog and they don't bother to let you know before you ask for them.We ordered two chicken quesadillas, two grilled beef tacos and one chicken taco. When the order came, I had one grilled beef taco, one ground beef taco and one chicken. I thought OK, whatever, it was a mix up. Then the waitress proceeded to insist that we had ordered one Carnitas and one chicken quesadilla, to what I politely requested that she brought the correct quesadilla. Instead of bringing the quesadilla, the waitress brought her order ticket to me and said \\"Just to be clear, I wrote Carnitas quesadilla.\\" This was a very rude action on the waitress part, but even more concerning was that the owner saw it all happen and either her, or the waitress apologized. \\nThat aside and on to the food, my grilled beef was tough and cold and unseasoned. The cheese they put on top of the tacos was also cold and the lettuce borderline wet. As for the the chicken taco, the corn tortilla was a bit too toasted, almost like it had been reheated just before assembling the taco. OK,  I could live with that, I thought, until i took the first bite  of the chicken and what do I find? The whole cartilage of the drumstick bone (top part with the two white round things). Needless to say that was the end of my meal. I have nothing against restaurants using dark meat in their chicken dishes, but, PLEASE inspect for cartilage traces!\\nThe food was nothing out of this world.

Why only a 3-star rating? Read on.First, this place is large. Not sure how they secured all this space, but there is plenty of dining room here. Even on a busy Saturday night we scored a nice table for 2 without a reservation in ~5 min. As we ate I noticed there never was a big queue as people kept arriving but were typically seated quickly even though the place seemed full. And they also have ample and lovely outdoor seating. The hosts were super sweet by the way - when was the last time you experienced that downtown?The decor is very contemporary modern - clean lines, lots of light, tasteful blonde and green muted colors with plenty of windows to bring in the impressive lighted Seaholm smoke stacks at night or beautiful blue skies in the daytime. Really a much more vibrant Austin-feeling place than some of the older, darker downtown spots where you're peering intently to try and make out the menu. What are those other places hiding?The servers - and there were quite a few - were moving. No hanging around gossiping with each other and they seemed friendly. Our server, Charlie, was just right as he was fast and efficient yet friendly, and he had the common sense to ask my date what she wanted first. Chivalry is not dead. He also knew the menu and answered questions well.Prices are moderate - dinner for two with drinks set us back just $60 and again, that's very competitive, especially downtown.Wow, Chris, you might say, you seemed to really like this place! Why only three stars? Thanks for asking kiddos - I'll tell you: the food did not knock me out. Now, let's be clear. It was not \\"bad\\" at all. Our hummus appetizer, in fact, was quite good. Our drinks of the Local Tap (something from Austin Beer Works - yea!) were good but served in a tulip goblet and held - at most - 8 oz of beer. For $6/glass I need at least twelve ounces, but, just another sign of the times: restaurants are killing alcohol sales with their ridiculous pricing to volume ratio.As for the entrees, my date felt like her poke bowl was okay, but def not as good as last time. Again, not bad, just not great. My lasagna bolognese was the same: flavorful, but not over the top and definitely average at best. I would not recommend it. As is the case with some of the newer restaurants, both servings were on the smaller side, yet thankfully not artificially \\"plated\\" to make them look bigger. As a man who worked outside all day, I was ready for some real food and yes, left a little hungry.Now: True Food has a nice compact menu, reasonable prices (skip the alcohol), fun servers and a clean and open environment, so I plan to go back. And hopefully after another visit or two I can bump up to fours stars. For me, there's nothing wrong with three stars, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.

If you seek comfort in phad Thai and three or four colors of curry to put on chicken, shrimp or tofu, then do not go to Pok Pok. On March 6, 2010, other diners beat us to Pok Pok, so the sweet young woman directing traffic offered us appetizers and drinks across the street at their Wiskey Soda Lounge to wait the estimated 1 hour.  There, the firey Chinese fungus forced me to gulp Thai iced tea to restore order to my taste buds.  The other two appetizers we shared were more within my tolerance.  There are no asterisks or red peppers on the menu to warn diners; you should ask how spicy.  The music was a little too loud & intense, with bad sound quality, which distracted diners rather than enhanced the venue.  Maybe at 11:00 p.m., when people are louder and drunk, the music would be less dominant.Back at Pok Pok, we all found something we wanted, plus sticky rice and coconut rice.  The authentic sticky rice, alone, is almost worth the trip to Pok Pok. Off the top of my head, I can't think of other restaurants in Portland that make sticky rice as well.

It costed $16 and the size portion felt like they left the other half of a sandwich behind. The bottom of the hoagie was soggy and the top part too crunchy. She got the Turkey Sausage 'sad face skillet'. For starters this was the saddest attempt of a skillet that didn't even come in a skillet. The 'poached' eggs were well done, no runiness at all. When you think of a skillet you envision a Medina-like brunch meal with the sauciness and all. Instead it came with two sausages, French fries they call 'potatoes', two well done boiled eggs and she had to request for the repini. All put individually onto the plate and somehow they decided to throw in bacon strips (menu had no mention).Overall: Very sad at our first and probably last visit to this place. The location has potential, the space is amazing. I will note that today was their first brunch serving but if things dont change quickly they shouldn't bother opening up for brunch. Spent $37 plus 10% for tip. Note: the servers did their job properly and efficiently.

Here's my $100 tip for future diners: When you order a dish spicy \\"HOT,\\" you WILL get it that way.Hubs, who lived in Mexico for a spell, prides himself on  being some sort of hotness afficionado -- meaning, there's no amount of hot that he can't handle. It's sort of a macho thing with him and a little on the unbelievable side. I've always expected that one day, I would live to see the fall of the braggodocio, which happened last night at Soi9.\\"Give it to me as hot as you can make it,\\" he asks boastingly to servers at nearly all Thai and Mexican restaurants. \\"I can handle it. I used to live in Mexico. Blah blah blah.\\"Usually, unbeknownst to him, there's some degree of translation between the server who takes the order, and the kitchen; a translation that is hidden from him:Server:  \\"Hey, there's this goofy guy out there who wants his Grilled Chicken with Papaya Salad as hot as you can make it,\\"  (wink, wink)So, the chef thinks to himself, \\"Well, I don't want to make it so hot that the poor guy can't handle it and complains, so I'll make it medium-hot.\\"Well, that quiet exchange didn't occur at Soi9. Apparently, the chef heard, \\"As spicy as you can make it,\\" and delivered exactly that.I played it safe and ordered the Panang Curry Beef, mild. It was love at first bite.I was also completely entertained by Mr. Macho Guy-I-Can-Handle-Anything *Cough-Cough-Tears-Involuntary-Sweating-and-Twitching* as he attempted to soldier his way through the papaya salad. It was so hot, he said, that he could not taste the poultry at all. I was sweet, and refrained from openly mocking him through most of the dinner.Eventually, he asked me for some of my Panang sauce; reasoning that if he poured some of that over the salad, \\"The curry will tone down the spiciness of my dish.\\" And at this point, I couldn't resist the urge to laugh any longer, and handed him a spoon.We really enjoyed Soi9. Really. I just wonder what happened to his insides as that food meandered below his esophagus."},{"name":"Casa B Tapas and Cocktail & Rum Bar","address":"253 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Hi.

My girlfriend and I moved here from out of town, lately we have been finding it hard to find a decent place to eat in the South Shore and this place was no exemption. I ordered rigatoni with meatballs and my girlfriend had the special linguine Margherita. We also ordered bruschetta and a Caesar salad for appetizers. The bruschetta is nothing more then a garlic flat-bread with some melted cheese, onions, and tomatoes. The tomatoes were pale, mushy, old and had no flavor. The whole thing was loaded with garlic salt. I have been to a bunch of Italian restaurants both here in the USA and back in Italy. Whenever I have ordered a normal bruschetta not once did it ever include chunks of red onion. On the menu they did not specify what was on the bruschetta so I was assuming the normal basil, cheese and tomatoes. So happened I like onions but my girlfriend who does not passed on this dish. Her Caesar salad was nothing special but, the salad dressing came in to go cup on the side which was a little weird. The cheese just looked like mozzarella you would put on top of the pizza.As for the main course I could only stomach a few bites before I asked the waiter to take it away. I really hope this was just my experience as the place was crowded and this restaurant has such high reviews. My sauce was burnt and you could easily taste it. I make my own sauce from the tomatoes I grow in my garden and know fresh sauce when I taste it. It tasted like the sauce was left on the stove for way too long and was burnt. My rigatoni was overcooked and I needed a spoon in order to eat it as they were just falling apart. The meatballs were okay nothing special but, I will give them some credit there they are made in house and not spongy at all.My girlfriends dish \\"Linguini Margherita\\" was worse then mine. It reads like it will be a light dish with the pasta coated in olive oil. Instead it comes in a bath of olive oil cheese and spices. It was almost the same texture as a cream sauce but there was no milk. The \\"buffalo mozzarella\\" is not true buffalo mozzarella and was just a cut up normal mozzarella ball and was tough to chew and swallow. The positives included the low prices, the wine, and the meatballs. Overall I would not recommend this place."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pokpok I call your BS.\\nCongrats on creating an epic yuppie hustle, i admire you for that.

They've received an insane amount of really good press and that's probably why there's always a line so long that they literally built a bar across the street to accommodate overflow. After visiting all 3 local locations numerous times, the magic and \\"ooh, aaah\\" factor for me has worn off a tad. Maybe it's because they're just too damn busy to put the time and quality into the food that they were once able to. Upon every visit, I order the fish sauce wings. The last few times I got them, they were coated in burnt garlic and that's definitely a peeve of mine. At first, they were my favorite wings, but maybe I was blinded by hype. Some of the other dishes on the menu never really impressed me all that much either. We ordered the grilled prawns once and they were so overcooked that I could barely peel the shell off. They were also overpriced. Kinda the same thing with the short ribs. They were lackluster and the cook on the ribs was not executed as well as I felt they could have done. Perhaps I have a knack for ordering the wrong things off a menu. With all that being said, pok pok still manages to get four stars out of me. Although they've been hit or miss a few times, their overall quality and dining experience is no less than 4 stars. I like what they're going for, but if you have an amazing menu and you have to pump out several hundred tickets as fast as you can every day for years on end, then yes, there will be moments where perfection becomes second to \\"good enough, send it to table 4\\" Aside from food, every good spot in PDX must have exceptional drinks and Pok Pok definitely has them. Some of their best beverages aren't even alcoholic. The table water for example, is one of my favorite things about Pok Pok. That interesting flavor in the water will bewilder some people at first but the servers will at least give you a heads-up that it is flavored with pandanus. It's kinda like a super mild tea flavor almost akin to genmaicha. Pandan is a type of palm leaf you can find in most asian markets and it imparts a wonderful flavor to broths and other dishes when steeped in hot liquid. One of my favorite cocktails on earth is served here too. The kaffir infused gin is pure genius. It's the perfect gin and tonic flavor combo. I love it so much that I started infusing my own at home. I even added some lemongrass to the last batch I made. YUM! I would also strongly suggest that you try as many flavors of their drinking vinegar as possible. That stuff is so delicious! The lychee and passion fruit were my two favorites. I know most people would think \\"gross! Vinegar?! For drinking?!\\" But I assure you, it's well worth it. It's a perfect balance of sweetness, dryness and acidity. Not at all \\"vinegary.\\" In closing, I'd like to recommend that anyone curious yet trepidatious, should seek out Pok Pok Noi up on 15th to get a sample of what Pok Pok is all about without having to wait in line. Hell, you can even go to Whiskey soda lounge and do your reconniassance there. If you really enjoyed it, then by all means, go to the main Pok Pok, take some friends from out of town, or just put your name on the list wait about 45 minutes and enjoy yourself."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"To say the least - this is one huge bookstore.

Despite the restaurant being somewhat small, our booth seats were spacious and encouraged some cozy conversation with our dining companions. They have a pretty large menu with items that have similar ingredients and descriptions, so I highly suggest taking a look at the menu and some Yelp photos before your visit to speed up the decision making. Verdict? The food ended up being very average. Most dishes lacked flavor and the Pok Pok wings, which are the most popular dish, was oddly almost too flavorful - overly salted and had a harsh mouth feel. The khao soi broth was disappointingly bland, but I did like the whole chicken drumsticks with meat that was fall-off-the-bone tender. Papaya salad was nothing special and the fried catfish noodle dish was oily and didn't have much fish. Even with my high expectations, I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes and would not recommend.

With each course, I found myself closing my eyes to savor all the subtle and decadent flavors. The 5 course summer chef tasting menu is $85pp and with wine tasting it is an extra $70. I didn't partake of the wine pairing, but my dining companion raved about the amazing selections of wine that came with each course and how they really enhanced the meal. We started with an amouche bouche that contained salmon with roe and some sort of mousse. The first course was black bass sashimi with fig. The second course was a tender and well marinated octopus tentacle that was so well cooked. The best preparation I've ever had. The third course was tail fish with chorizo emulsion and English peas. The fourth course was a delectable lamb chop that had my eyes rolling backwards. The fifth course was a dessert selection consisting of pistachio and vanilla ice cream, calvados souffl√© and raspberry beignet. The desserts were all very sweet and sugary, perhaps the only real flaw to an otherwise epic meal.

The sauce on top was good, but would have been just good on cornchips or sawdust, for that matter. The tuna with puttanesca sauce was excellent.

Alas, my desire to pretty up and wear some heels outbid steak at home.And I'm glad we went out! Started off with dirties at the bar (his a little dirtier than mine) with blue cheese stuffed olives.  Perfectly mixed and nary a lipstick stain to be found anywhere.  We moved to our table, started with the raw oysters (obligatory V-Day \\"aphrodisiac\\") and a bottle of Sterling Cab.  For the price, including the Mitchell's markup, a great bottle of wine.  And thankfully our server wasn't visibly judging us for a) a lower priced bottle and b) not having a Pouilly-Fume with our oysters.Having just come from a joint session at the gym (hey, a girl's gotta be in a two piece come vacation in the Bahamas!), we were absolutely famished and some protein was exactly what we had in mind.  Our server was really knowledgeable about cuts, the effect of dry aging, and the different marbling characteristics of each cut.  We settled on a boneless rib-eye for me, and NY strip (iirc) for him.  Yeah, the rib-eye is the way to go -- far more flavorful than the strip, almost as tender as a filet, and perfectly medium rare.

You will, however, wait a long time to get a table. Also - when you put your name down (on an ipad - they manage all waitlists electronically) they don't have any ability to give you a wait time. Seems strange to me that they expect people to just indefinitely wait? haha. I asked them about it and they said they are 'working on it'. Seems like something I would get done ASAP. It's not rocket science. Put a dang algorithm in there and just give me an estimate. It's a bit crazy to just expect people to put their name down and sit around for who knows how long...but I digress.

Here's why.Extra moist (meaning extra fatty) brisket is the best idea ever....so tender and delicious.Creamed corn is out of this world.  Almost like a dessert.New Potatoes are very soft and buttery...drowning in butter sauce actually.  Save them by drowning them in your stomach acid!Sausage comes spicy (with jalapeno) or regular,  but it doesn't matter.....it's aaaalllll good.The Sause (no that is not misspelled that's how they spell it) is the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  I'm usually a fan of sweeter sauces but this one works better.  Spicy and peppery with a hint of sweetness.Pudding: Chocolate or Banana?  Chocolate or Banana?  Damnit!  Both are so good...I'll take one of each please!  Both topped with whipped cream.  Banana comes with the standard vanilla wafers (can you imagine banana pudding without vanilla wafers?), and chocolate comes with an oreo that is like heaven to eat because it's soft from being in the pudding.Drinks:  Nice beer selection, and they have glass bottled sodas!  Nice touch.  You can get regular fountain sodas/drinks too.  I don't like tea but everyone tells me that their tea is some of the best ever.Atmosphere: Banquet style picnic tables, and you eat on butcher paper.  Another nice touch.  Who needs plates?!?

We were seated right away, but unfortunately the window seats were all filled up. We were put right by the aisle to the kitchen, but their classy upholstered striped chairs (they also have the cute French-looking wicker kind) made up for the not so prime table location!  I had an iced tea, and although I'm a devout Splenda fan, I tried the brown sugar cubes they had in a little cup on our table (not sure how sanitary that is, but oh well). I ordered the Muffaletta sandwich (salami, ham, prosciutto, provolone cheese, pepperoncini and lemon aioli). It was served with a mixed green salad for $12. The sandwich was good, but not amazing, and the salad was a little heavy on the lemony dressing. My boyfriend ordered the special of the day (which they said they're planning to add to the regular menu)--a cheese steak sandwich with the flat-iron steak from their dinner menu, onions, and red/green peppers for $10. BOY was this gooood (I stole several larrrge bites)! The shoe-string fries it came with were perfectly seasoned and cooked with just the right amount of crispiness. The couple next to us ordered the fries on the side and they came nicely presented in a paper cone. My eternal food-envy kicked in, and I was also eyeing the breakfast panini that arrived next to me.Overall: the service was great, food was tasty and presented nicely, prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere alone almost made me give it 5 stars!

Many has tagged me as the evil monster that *gasp* gave them a 3 star for the restaurant. Honestly, I don't care and many of them won't care of what I have to say now :) I feel like they have really grown as an establishments for providing good eats 'street' foods for a good price. They did raise some items by a couple bucks but i thinks it valid consider it was priced really low before. The food now is seasoned well but occasionally, it misses the mark but overall done well. My favorites include: Gua Bow (buns with pork belly), fried fish seasoned w/salt, pepper and paprika (box or separate by it self), and pork over belly rice. All those items are 5 dollars and under. The flavor isn't very complex but its mostly very tasty. Sometimes simple is best - just salt and pepper. If you have a group, I think its great to grab a few of the small items things to share so you could try a variety of things. If you're flying solo, then a lunch box is a smart way to go. It comes with rice, noodles, broccoli, and your main entree. (I am actually not such a fan that there are two starches and the use of broccoli. I would much prefer something like baby bok choy.)Small place. Great for groups of 4 or smaller. Perfect for lunch.

I tried the chef's tasting menu and I enjoyed it. There were interesting dishes, good dishes, and some not quite perfectly tuned dishes. Service was very attentive and the timing of the dishes was good. The atmosphere upstairs is intimidate and romantic with a nice view of the commons, but a lot of tables do feel a bit crammed. We were sat near another group that was almost spilling over into our space despite plenty of tables being open in other sections. The meal started with an enjoyable squash soup with chestnuts amuse-bouche. The soup had a very good flavor and the chestnuts added some texture. The second dish was a mackerel crudo that seemed to be slightly torched. I think the slight smokiness cut the fishiness nicely. The other elements on the dish specifically a green gel did not taste great on their own, but all together made for a nice bite. The two next dishes were a pork belly and a foie gras. They were both fine, but having fatty and fatty back to back I feel lessened their impact. I thought the halibut was the best dish. It was cooked to moist and flaky perfection. Unfortunately, it ended up a tad on the overly salty side. The bucatini were fine, but also quite salty. The steak with red wine sauce was nicely cooked, but it did not wow me. The dessert was very good. It was a trio of a lovely seasonal pumpkin souffle, a tasty almond mouse, and a very rich chocolate concoction.For the price of dinner, I thought some of the miscues were disappointing and I did not have any wow moments. I also think there were some issues with the composition of the tasting menu as a meal. That said, I left happy overall and very very full.

They said while they didn't take reservations, they would put our name down and see what they could do. We ended up arriving, and while there seemed to be a huge wait, we let the hostess know our name and was seated quickly. It was an absolutely amazing dinner that consisted of not being able to wait to meet our little man.Fast forward once again to tonight where we are once again celebrating an anniversary at this amazing establishment.

It's a fantastic new Vietnamese Restaurant just on the outskirts of Old Town. It's part Restaurant part bar and all delicious. This was my first adventure into Vietnamese cuisine and it won't be my last. Upon arriving we were greeted warmly by a young lady who took us to our table and took us on a tour through their menu, from Appetizers through the different entrees. She took our drink order while we perused the menu and made our choices. When our server came over, he was a sweet young man from all places Morocco, which made me giggle. But he was quick to suggest the Goi cuon, summer rolls filled with pork and shrimp, rice noodles and vegetables all rolled up in rice paper and served with a delightful peanut sauce. Then we also both decided on the Pho Seafood. The appetizer came out very quickly and we weren't disappointed. The were fresh and crispy. The peanut sauce was a perfect pairing of flavor. While the Goi Cuon settled we chatted and before we knew it our server was returning with our two huge bowls of Pho. If you have not had Pho like I hadn't, it is a delightful broth over onion, thin delicate rice noodles, and the protein you choose. Then it is also served with a plate of fresh basil and sprouts. This was so delicious and so filling and I look forward to trying this again. As we were paying our bill the sweet woman that greeted us in the beginning offered us each a Bubble Tea on the house. We were both so excited and speechless. We already were impressed with our fabulous meal and now being treated to a sample of their tea, is so nice. I chose the Strawberry and my friend chose the Mango. Both were so delicious that we look forward to coming back and trying additional flavors.

Everything is presented beautifully.  The desserts taste good, but what do you expect for an almost $10 dessert?  Can't make up your mind?  Might as well get the shared plate of desserts and try smaller versions of several different ones for at most $10 more.  They have a selection of wines, including several flights to choose from such as ice wines, sparkling wines, and noble wines ranging from $10-$17.

I'd never had these before, so I will admit that this may be an issue of me not loving bocaditos rather than poor execution by Cuba 512.I also tried someone's sandwich, which was certainly better than my order but I'd bet good money the bread was Hawaiian bread -- not crusty like I'd expect.The two stars are all for the service, which was great."},{"name":"Bombay Grill","address":"2165 Savoy Dr","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was great and it's a huge shame that it burned down.

I was in the mood for the angel hair pasta with red tomatoe-y sauce, so i asked if i should go with the carbonara pasta or the Diavolo thingie, and the guy said diavolo. So thats what i went with + salmon. I asked for extra shredded cheese on top of mine. BOY! was that ish good! The only thing i wish it had was a lil more sauciness to the sauce, but i cant really complain. It was dang good. The sauce was a lil bit spicy though, so WARNING for those that get the diavolo, watch out if you cant take heat very well because they can't adjust the level of spiciness. We also ordered a garlic bread thingie and the kid's chicken tenders. The chicken tenders took forever to make but this is not a complaint! because it came out hot and piping fresh so they did a good job with it.The garlic bread thingie is just a piece of thin pita with garlic and pan fried. its pretty thin. It was a bit lacking in what i imagined it to be. i would pass on this next time and maybe try a pepperoni stick.the sodas were great too! i tried the peach tea and the blood orange. delish! atmosphere: was chic, filled with families, and incredibly crowded for a friday evening.

Grab a cup of coffee in their shop and take a tour. But make sure to wear your comfortable shoes, because you will find yourself unable to leave. You will walk and walk and walk, up and down the stairs, here and there, looking at book after book. It's easy to loose yourself in a place like this, physically and mentally. So make sure that you have nothing else important planned, you won't get to it.Their comic book section is something to be marveled at. Next time I go I must take pictures and post them up. I am addicted to many forms of books and stories, comic books have become a dirty secret of sorts. When I go to buy them, this is the place to do it.

I think if they would just allow reservations for the one 8 person table that it would improve the seating service.

Typically, folks arrive 10 or so minutes before their reservation but the host made probably 15-20 people stand around by the door (super crowded) for about 20 minutes and acted surprised that we were all there. Um, we all had 9am reservations!  We ended up being seated at our table at around 9:15. It was a hectic and weird way to start our experience!  I hope they change their system to either ensure they are ready to seat people at 9am or start taking reservations a little after they open, say beginning at 9:15, to minimize people standing around the door."},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First time at JW Orlando was the last.

So I decided to give it a try.  Walked in and gagged from the smoke.  Why are people allowed to smoke in a restaurant in 2014?!  I was told there was a non-smoking area so I made way for that door.  When I opened it, I fell down a couple of steps.  There may have been a sign warning about the steps, I don't know.  I was too busy trying to get out of the smoke!So there I was collecting myself up off the floor with a busted knee.  Two servers looked at me and then went on about their business.  No concern whatsoever for a patron having fallen in their establishment.  So I walked over to one of these ladies and she was conversing causally with another customer.  I stood within 5 feet of them, not wanting to interrupt, waiting for her to break away and get me seated.  She glanced at me again and went back to her conversation, without even so much as acknowledging my presence.  OK, so obviously, these people do not want my business, I thought.  Nor do they care that I hurt myself in their restaurant.  Still, I stood there for a few minutes to give this server a chance to either disengage from her chat and help me, or send someone else my way.  She did neither.  As I stood there, I looked around and noticed how horrifyingly NASTY the non-smoking area of the place is.  At that point, I turned around and walked the hell out.  I spoke with a neighbor about this experience and she recounted the last time she ventured in there.  While eating, a roach bug crawled across her foot.Alas, I will never know how awesome the vittles at Vittles are because I will never set foot in that disgusting pest hole ever again.If Yelp would allow it, I would give this dump NO STARS."},{"name":"Brassica","address":"2212 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"4.5","text":"This was such a happy find!

We waited almost 40 min after that for our mains. Then, a server approached us and said they could not serve us the lettuce wrap because the lettuce was rotten. I thought it would have been nice if they told us earlier as we had been waiting so long but I didn't say anything. She then opened a menu and showed me an item and said, \\"try this its just like lettuce wrap.\\" She seemed very hurried, I was reluctant but very hungry, so I said, \\"Is it fast to prepare?\\" and she said yes and just walked away. A few minutes later she came with the replacement dish. A few bites is it turned out to really not be to my liking. Mostly the food there was good (not my first time there) but this dish was not good. And it was $17. So I called her over and apologized but said I really didn't like the dish and could I just have Szechuan shrimp because I know I like it. Well, she let out a sneer and walked away! 5 min later the manager walked up to our table shaking his head and said, \\"I don't know why you don't like that dish everyone else does!\\" and walked away!! Then the first lady came over and said they would be charging us 50% for the dish we sent back!! We ate maybe 15% of it tops! UNBELIEVABLE!! I then told them no way would I pay, I came for lettuce wrap and they waited 35 min to tell us they didn't have any - and could they just please bring the shrimp as we were starving!! (my four year old was getting pretty hungry too) She told us she would not bring the shrimp, because we might send that back too!!!!

We had never tried their other locations (or heard of them prior to this restaurant's arrival in Beverly), but it sounds like the restaurant group has a great reputation that precedes it.  True to the other reviews, the prices were slightly higher than your run of the mill Chinese restaurant, however the quality of the food more than made up for it.  The ingredients were incredibly fresh, and well prepared in everything we tried.  My fianc√© was really impressed by the octopus carpaccio, with an above average presentation. You can tell that these people really care about putting out a beautiful dish by the flower garnishes present on most all of them.  I had the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, which was really good, and filling.  I also had the caterpillar roll which was another beautifully prepared dish.  For an entree, my fianc√© had the steamed chicken and vegetables in a bamboo basket.  They brought out a sauce on the side as well. The dish could not have tasted fresher or healthier, which was exactly what he had hoped for.  The interior was really well done, and was more than I had expected for a \\"strip mall\\" type of restaurant.  The high ceilings, expansive bar, and plentiful seating all contributed to making this restaurant feel like a step up from your average Chinese restaurant.

The veal parm sub was also lacking anything approaching flavor. The veal was surprisingly cooked very well and was tender. Skip this place.

It's like a springtime vacation in Paris. Time slows down, conversations linger and the Sunday paper can be savored as much as your meal. Beyond the simple black door, one is greeted by the daily display of fresh baked goods. During the week there are selections from their dessert menu for dinner, but during the brunch they add wonderful assortments of breakfast pastries. The expansive windows, which nearly stretch from the elegantly silver gilded ceiling, to the classically black and white tiled floor, invite as much sunlight as Portland will offer. Any good brunch starts with a great drink. Depending on your night before, Everett St. offers superb selections of mimosas, Bloody Marys, and fresh squeezed orange juice and Sleeping Monk Fresh brewed coffee. However, if you are looking for a true upgrade from your daily Starbucks, order their French Press. It's not on the menu, but it is the best coffee in town, bar none. Much like the dcor, the menu is sumptuous mix of classic European brunch and Northwest twists. The Ham Scramble at Everett St. consists of black forest ham, Tillamook white cheddar and caramelized shallots. And the only thing better than eggs benedict is when it is served on a bed of Dungeness crab cakes. If it weren't for the guilt from other patiently waiting brunchers, I'd just assume stay for lunch."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good Italian.

We sat for about 10-15 minutes before finally leaving our designated seats to find a hostess. She said she had no idea we were waiting, and asked how long we had been there to try to figure out where to put us on the wait list.We were seated fairly quickly after that. We ordered hot wings, which took approximately 45 minutes to arrive. It was $12 for 8 hot wings (which were actually all drumettes, not wings) which seemed outrageous to us. Our pasta (beef shin ragu) arrived quickly after and was teensy with barely any identifiable meat. For $18, it also seemed outrageous, although it tasted quite good. The beers were drank were well-priced, in contrast, but they only sell their own beers so that makes sense.All in all, although the food tasted good, it was very over-priced and small.

We had one carafe of water which only filled half our glasses and had to ask for more. We also had 2 very small bowls of peanuts and when we asked for more we were told no that we would have to buy more if we wanted them.

I thought they'd be more savory but instead they were sweet. Delicious! The rock shrimp were so tender and tasty. They were served with little fried plantains. Simply fantastic. On to the main course. The ribeye was a slam dunk. The quality was exactly as I expected. The taste was perfect. The sides we chose: risotto, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, onion rings, twice baked potato and I think one more but I'm forgetting now. I'd probably skip the potatoes next time.

The dishes are inspired from Northern Thai street food. Maybe that is why dinner felt off for me. To go along with the Mt. Everest-ian high expectations, it was a so-so experience. Perhaps I'm naive and this IS real Thai food and all other Thai food I've had are pretenders to the throne. Without a trip to Northern Thailand on my immediate itinerary, I'm left to contemplate on my meal here.What I had:-Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings: Everyone gets these. They were salty, spicy, sweet, sticky. This is drunk food at its finest. I would gladly have a bucket of these.- Mua Paa Kham Waan: Boar collar meat served with mustard greens and a spicy chili lime garlic sauce. The boar meat was quite tender but the spicy sauce overwhelmed my mouth. That's what ruined the dish for me.-Kaeng Hung Leh: Sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry. Very similar to a Vietnamese dish that my grandmother makes. I wish I had known that beforehand so I could order something new.-Laap Pet Isaan: Spicy Northeastern Thai chopped duck salad w/ duck liver and skin. This one was SUPER spicy. Not even the cool green that you were supposed to eat it with could calm the fire in my mouth.

We've ordered from Great Wok numerous times and the food is pretty decent - my better half always orders chow mein and is happy with it. But after the last delivery experience, I'm going to start going elsewhere for Chinese, or at least, no longer rely on delivery. I ordered through GrubHub, delivery was slated for 45 minutes later...no problem. Finally, 15 minutes after the expected delivery time (and one hour after placing our order), I called. Guy who answered didn't even say \\"Great Wok\\" and was abrupt. Didn't ask who I was or what my order was, just said \\"20 minutes\\" and hung up. My husband called later, couldn't get an estimated delivery time, and I finally gave up and picked it up. When I got there, there was no apology, no thank you, the guy just handed me my food.  There were other people there who seemed agitated as well. Someone called while I was waiting and the guy told him to call back in 10 minutes.(Update: My husband had said \\"we're not paying for delivery\\" and the man at Great Wok told me he'd removed the delivery charge when I asked. We checked our credit card later on and the full charge is still there. So, I knocked my initial review down to 1 star.)I can deal with average food more easily than poor service. I get that sometimes someone calls in sick, skips a shift, etc. I would have felt better if the man working there had apologized, given an explanation, *something,* instead of just acting like customers were an inconvenience. By the time I got it home, it was 90 minutes after we'd ordered. I don't know how long our food had been sitting there, so obviously it was ready to be delivered. As for the $2 delivery charge, it's not about the money, it's about us asking - twice - for it to be removed, which I think was fair, and being told that the bill was adjusted, when it wasn't.

There have been standouts of good service but then overall the consistency is not there. Areas in particular need of improvement.   The pool staff (very short handed) and don't pay attention well to customers flagging for service.    Out front valet staff not attentive but busy (again maybe understaffed).  Inconsistency in service in restaurants.  Also some standouts in areas where service consistently good like in the lobby bar.  After issues with wait staff first day at kitchen we had some of our best service ever following. Room one day had a water leak they had to vacuum up. Never found out where water came from. The transportation company they use for parks removes a star in itself.  You book a day ahead of time so they know when you are being picked up and you tell them when your returning from the park. So they know exactly when and how many people to pickup.  Makes sense.  Except hey don't appear to use any of that info.   First off every day used they were 30 minutes late picking up.  When they would show up on one pickup at hotel and also at a pickup at park they sent too small a vehicle for all the people signed up.  Another 30 minute wait at both places for pickup. Poor management and a black eye for the hotel. Town and county transportation is a very bad service!   They lied one time saying traffic held them up (ummm we have google we can see there is no traffic).    There were about 40 people waiting nearly an hour for them going to another hotel.

It was listed as Rice Noodles with Saute or Stir Fried Beef I think?The prices here are def cheaper tham my usual Chinese Spot - Tasty Wok on Colonial.They charge $8.95 for Beef Chow Fun here and at Tasty Wok its about $2-3 more perhaps?They do not serve Walnut Glazed Prawns here unfortunately.. However they do serve Wor Wonton Soup! Which is my fave as well!I opted for the Beef Chow Fun to test their skills on preparing such a basic dish - This is how I test restaurants based on their cultures basic foods - If they can prepare this noodle dish then I may be a diner again.The serving was family style -- And I took a bite and taste of the Beef Chow Fun and it was Delicious! I was looking for a wok smoked taste and it had it similar to Tasty Wok and having it in California! I then opted for the Yang Chow Fried Rice -- Uhmmm this was yummy however Tasty Wok I prefered better version of.They had 1 server and she was kind but I think very busy for just 4 diners? I agree on service being mediocre. They serve dimsum here I hear and I havent tried that yet Because I'm loyal to Mings Bistro for Dim Sum! I will def come back and try the Wor Wonton Soup and perhaps the DimSum next time and Also their pan fried noodles!"},{"name":"Casa Alvarez","address":"3161 Walnut St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"Food and service are amazing!

Back in my undergrad days I visited this place quite often, but there was a time that kept me away until my most recent visit. AMBIANCE: \\nModern, clean and well kept. They have a decent bar area and have many booths as seating options. The bathrooms are supper nice.  Overall the setting makes for a great meal.   FOOD: \\nThey have complimentary chips with two different salsas: one mild and one spicy, they are both great but I prefer the spicy one. I've also tried their home-made guacamole which can be made to your liking.  The Chicken Enchiladas con salsa Poblana (creamy white sauce) are my favorit, it's two enchiladas so a side of beans is encouraged. For Dessert we ordered the Brownie with Ice Cream, which was supper good, it's heated in a pan with sugar and just melts in your mouth! CUSTOMER SERVICE: \\nOk so that one time that kept me away was when a group of us visited and our waiter seemed to be sort of \\"scared\\" or \\"frazzled\\" every time he attended to us..so frazzled that when he was about to take my plate, the knife that was clearly not at the center of the plate, fell right next to me as he picked it up!

Burton's was always extremely courteous and accommodating about updating our reservation whenever I called, even on the day of.  Customer service-wise, it was FANTASTIC and we really appreciated their flexibility.Food is comparable to most other restaurants.  It's not food that is out of this world but the quality is there.   They are good, nicely presented, and something for everyone (from seafood, to steak, vegetarian) and priced fairly.  For a party of 17 (with about 13 apps + 17 entrees + handful of drinks), it came out to roughly $45-46/pp. Highly recommend the risotto fritters and stuffed zucchini for apps.  Overall, if you are looking for a nice and accommodating restaurant for a large party and you don't want to spend $100/pp and want to be able to secure a reservation, this will be a good choice.

Majority of my great finds come from Groupon experiences and this place was unfortunately not one of them. My family and I wanted to try out their happy hour menu since it was our first time here. Happy hour is a great opportunity to try out various menu items at a fraction of the cost. We wanted to order lots of happy hour menus on top of using our Groupon voucher but the owner said that we couldn't combine offers. Mind you, it does not state that on the Groupon voucher or on the happy hour menu. The sad part is the place seems like a small owned business so for them to not want to sell more of their food to earn more revenue is beyond my understanding. My sister and I are wine drinkers and would've purchased wine from the happy hour menu to drink with our dinner entrees but not after the fact that the restaurant owner and waitress seemed offended that we used a Groupon voucher. If I were them I would've let my customers redeem the Groupon and order off the happy hour menu because they are spending more on top of already paying for a Groupon voucher. Since we've had a bad first impression, we will not be returning to this restaurant. As for my review of the food, I did not order any items from the happy hour menu. We had a Groupon for four that includes: 4 entrees up to $10.95 each, 4 fountain drinks, and 4 small cannolis. I ordered the Stoppe trio with linguini pasta over roasted tomato sauce and the traditional meatball, and two chicken parmigiana meatballs. The restaurant is named \\"The Meatball Stoppe\\" and their meatballs are nothing to brag or boast about. Their sauce is also very basic like a can of tomato sauce with no originality to it. I took a bite of their homemade cannolis and they were dry and chalky. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you use a Groupon even with a Groupon I felt the food was not worth the price I paid for the voucher. The pictures I took of the food look better than it actually tasted."},{"name":"Habibi Lebanese Semoran","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped here on the way out of Orlando Airport and liked it so much that I am here again today before leaving Orlando.

The hamburger my wife ordered was juicy & flavorful while my steak/blue cheese flat bread was exceptional.  The first hurdle of a successful restaurant is to provide a quality product which I can say Salamanders has achieved.

But I think I would have been being overly gracious. Kevin Rathbun Steak knocked it out of the park, but I also paid over $300 for 2 people, so that should be expected. Some minor things were off, so we'll go with 4 stars.It's my birthday weekend and I was craving a good steak, I have been yet to try this place so we decided to give it a shot. I had a 9:30 reservation but misjuged the amount of time it would take to get there, so we got there at 9:10. The table wasn't ready so we headed over to the bar. The bar was CROWDED with a lot of very drunk mid to late 40s people. It was incredibly entertaining - it almost made the 40 minute wait for our table seem like a lot less. Kristie got a glass of wine that was excellent, and I ordered my go-to pre steak cocktail, a Manhattan. This is the first part that edged me towards 4 stars instead of 5. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RESTAURANT OWNERS, DO NOT LET YOUR BARTENDERS SHAKE MANHATTANS. MANHATTANS ARE STIRRED. SHAKEN MANHATTANS MAKE SMALL CHILDREN (and grown adults like myself) CRY. Needless to say, my manhattan sucked. Also, standard issue maraschino cherries that you can buy at Kroger for like $.99 for 100? Come on, this was a $20 drink. Let's brandy some cherries, or at least spring for Luxardos..We got seated at about 9:50, a bit longer than I would have liked to wait, but again the drunkards at the bar were very entertaining - so all is well. We were approached almost immediately by our server, William. And let me say, William is the man. I'd give 10 stars for his service if I could. He is a true professional. He gave us a run down of the menu, wished me a happy birthday, and gave us a few minutes to look. We settled on a bottle of Stag's Leap Artemis Cabernet (incredible, by the way) and on the Lobster Fritters to start. Side note on the wine, they bring out Decanters and decant the wine, which is awesome. The lobster fritters came out shockingly fast, it felt like 5 minutes max. I was very surprised. I had ordered them because so many people on yelp talk about them, and I love lobster. Unfortunately I was a little underwhelmed. The breading was excellent, but the lobster itself was a bit overcooked and chewy. Also the citrusy sauce they come on is not the right sauce in my opinion. I'd probably prefer a sauce with some spice and sweetness. They weren't bad, just kind of meh.Next we got the bread, one of my favorite parts of a steak house. The bread was good, but not AS good as many other steakhouses. Again, just kind of meh. Next we split a Caesar Salad. Now this was delicious. There is nothing better before a steak than a solid caesar salad, and they hit this one out of the park.For our steak we split the Dry Aged Cowboy Ribeye at the recommendation of William. I had asked him for his opinion between this and the Dry Aged steak for 2, and was impressed that he gave me his honest opinion rather than sending me to the more expensive option. The steak was cooked perfectly and I thought the flavor was incredible. Kristie wasn't as excited as I was - but nonetheless it was an excellent steak. For sides we got the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Both were wonderful accompaniments.William offered me a free dessert for my birthday and we enjoyed the creme brulee, it was exquisite.In terms of the atmosphere, I loved the decor and feel of the restaurant. But they definitely have some things they could improve on. I think they should make William a trainer, as his service was excellent, but the service from everyone else we encountered was just average.

Aside from the boil, their sides, whether it's the fries, potatoes, sausage, corn, or garlic noodles are all good.  You cannot go wrong no matter what you choose.When I'm here on my own/getting take-out after a long day, I'll opt for their fried oysters which come with fries.  While it's just overall a heavy dish, I'm back for more always because it's just so good and the wait time is rarely more than 15 minutes.I'm not sure if this is the BEST seafood boil or fried oysters in the city of Boston but thus far (1+ years in), I haven't felt the need or the desire to go anywhere else for a good ol' boil."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're downtown without a reservation, this is the place to go.

I finally had the opportunity on Monday evening before the Red Sox baseball game when myself and my daughter went. I had not been in the venue since it was Great Bay and I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and vibe, I really liked the look and feel of the restaurant. I also thought that for the most part, the service was excellent. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the food. I am not a raw oyster fan so I cannot comment on the oysters. As I had heard mostly great things about the oyster sliders, both myself and my daughter tried an oyster slider. While it was good, it was nothing terribly special, one nice, large, fried oyster on a cute slider bun with a dab of aioli (mayo). I ordered the Lobster Roe Noodles and my daughter a Burger. Others might object to the size of the lobster dish but I am not a big eater so I did not mind the small portion. My objection was that I found the flavor combination to be kind of just ok, the overwhelming flavor was that of the short rib, with no distinctive flavor from either the lobster, the exotic mushrooms or any seasoning or spice. I have had some great pasta dishes in my life and this was not one of them. As far as the burger, my daughter ordered the burger medium rare and it came out pretty raw. This was our fault for not mentioning it or sending it back so I cannot fault them too much for that. Overall, loved the vibe, atmosphere and service but food...meh.

The result: soggy skin, rather than a crisp texture to play against the meat.  The papaya salad had spicy teeth but otherwise lacked distinguishing character or flavor.Service was punctual but, like the food, nothing special.Cost for chicken with salad and an ice tea: $30. including 20% tip.Based on my initial visit, I can only conclude that Pok Pok is resting on its laurels and has become a tourist phenom.

Coming from Queens I'm no stranger to Thai fare as its my favorite cuisine. For reference, my favorite Thai restaurant in the US is Somtum Der in the East village so this will be a comparison to that experience. For starters the waiting period for both places are nearly identical. Pok Pok had a line out the door and a minimum waiting time of 1.5 hours for seating for 2. I believe it is possible to get reservations for larger parties, but as it was only two people that night we had to coolly wait for our place in line. Once we were seated we were greeted by an overwhelming menu. There's a lot going on, but my suggestion would be to use the waiters to get a sense of dishes you might like to try. We only had room for two dishes which were the Boar Collared Meat and the Pork Belly / shoulder curry. The Boar collar was immense! Such a wonderful explosion of flavor on such a nicely cooked piece of meat. Be warned it does have a spice profile so would stray away if you do not like this. The curry was a tad lackluster in my mind. It was sweet (with the strong taste of coconut milk coming through), and rather deep in flavor. The pork belly definitely added to the umami, but at the same time it overpowered the flavor in the spice base. While definitely not Somtum Der level of food, I would honestly rate this in my list of top 5 Thai restaurants. Would definitely recommend stopping here and trying this out!"},{"name":"Tim Hortons","address":"3623 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2","text":"I only give it one star so I can leave a review.

I was not in the mood for no ac, a line down the block and snippy waitstaff.  Other yelp reviews said \\"great food\\" but bad attitude and always a line.  Today was a day to stay indoors, not to venture forth.  But my trusty dinner partners are more adventurous and we forged on.  I had a back up plan (a list of area restaurants with ac!) but there was no need at all!  Cafe Baraka may have at one point not had ac but it does now.  There was no line- the small place was full but we sat down right away and were not rush throughout our meal.  The waiter was fantastic.  Courteous, helpful and prompt without rushing us.  And the food was amazing as well.

Made a reservation on Open Table for 5:30pm and they had our table waiting for us when we arrived.First off, REALLY GREAT SERVICE.  I've almost never experience service as prompt and helpful as ICOB has.  We had a waiter for our table, but whenever any other waiter noticed anything (our water was low, we needed more bread, etc.), they would swoop in and fulfill our every need.  Really fantastic, and our food came out almost as soon as we finished the previous course, to boot.Regarding food, I'm not a huge raw oyster fan, but the one I had (Chatham) was briny and flavorful.  My girlfriend had the ICOB Duxbury which had a more delicate, aromatic flavor.  On the side, we got the standard salt and lemon, plus a huge array of hot sauces (which we declined to utilize, but appreciated the possibility).Moving on to the appetizers, the clam chowder was standard but the buttermilk biscuit-croutons soaking in the soup were amazing.  Fluffy and oh-so-heavenly.  We also shared a fried oyster slider, which was decent: perhaps a tad too much brioche and not enough oyster, but generally speaking good.Entrees: I got the lobster roe noodles while my girlfriend enjoyed the seafood casserole.  The lobster roe noodles were definitely one-of-a-kind: the noodles themselves are quite savory, if a tad salty.  LOTS of short rib and they really don't skimp on the lobster chunks, which was refreshing to experience.  The seafood casserole was decent, lots of fish, shrimps, scallops, and lobster (again, they don't skimp on the seafood portions) although the flavor was not to my taste.We skipped dessert (nothing too appealing on the menu, although it does change rather frequently).  All in all, I give ICOB 5 stars, mostly for the fantastic service and the great lobster roe noodles."},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"This is my second review of this eating establishment.  My first (dinner) try did not really meet my expectations but as an invited (lunch) guest, I gave it another try.\\nFirst of all, we were greeted by a lovely server, Katerina, who recognized my dining companion from previous encounters.  We indicated we needed a little time to talk and she was non-intrusive but observant. As soon as we put our menus down to signal service, she came right to the table. \\nI ordered the mussels appetizer and asked if the chef might add some chilies, as I am a fan of the spice. They arrived in a delightful wine scented broth scattered with capers, garlic, green olives and artichokes and Katerina even brought me an extra serving of red pepper flakes!  \\nThese were not your mama's mussels for sure!  Delightful and aromatic, served with 2 slices of grilled bread to sop up all that delicious broth. I would definitely return to have this tasty appy again.  \\nAlthough some of the menu items are a bit pricey for what you get, when you get some excellent service (like from Katerina) and a tasty, redeeming meal, I would tend to venture back for more after my second try maybe more for lunch than their very busy dinner service."},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"2712 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 106","city":"Rollingwood","stars":"4","text":"Had issues but Corey is a stand up guy and we worked it out.

The atmosphere is clean and bright, the pastries and the most beautiful I've seen outside of Paris (and most delicious)! The New Orleans iced coffee is another favorite of mine too!

Also, while I respect the coffee purist approach of a plain latte I also don't see what's wrong with offering a few basic flavors of syrup to add (vanilla, hazelnut, caramel) and that also doesn't seem to be an option.

The chicken was okay and the polenta reminded us of the plastic toy food we played with as kids. We even made a video making fun of it, lots if laughs. My friend ordered the burger and it was so chard she only took 2 bites of it. The fries were good. I order the hanger steak mid rare, $27. When you pay that much for a steak you expect it to be good. It was definitely not mid rare... It was charred and well done.  Once we complained to our waitress and asked to at least get a discount she said she'd ask and then basically ignored us.

First impressions: beautiful space, improbably cool for Union Square, but hey, other places have invested a ton in decor and not delivered in service (e.g. Catalyst in Cambridge).  But the second you walk in you're greeted by a cheerful staff and the service lived up to that impression from start to finish.  Example: we ordered a bottle of Rioja that our server recommended, but after a few sips it didn't wow us. She decanted it, but it still didn't open up.  She took it back and off the check, and brought us two glasses of Tempranillo that were great.  At the end of our meal, the owner stopped by and apologized for the wine.  Who does that?  The food: I would go back for the sesame tuna and the chorizo al jerez, and the crispy plaintains they put down in place of bread is a nice touch.  There were about ten other things I wanted to try, but I'll definitely be back to work my way through the menu.  Tip: ask for a table downstairs, or a seat at the kitchen bar so you can watch the action.  Upstairs is bright and airy but the downstairs room is the real surprise, intimate lighting, and with a live wall on one end that makes you feel like you're in the tropics.

Furthermore, each room is divided into aisles, each of which are assigned a number that corresponds to a sub-genre of books. For example, if I want to find the \\"math\\" books, I'll walk to the \\"rose\\" room, which contains books of the \\"sciences\\" genre, and then, I'll look for the aisle with a sign that says \\"672\\" on it.

We love Thai food and eat it constantly in LA so we wanted to see what Portland had to offer in the way of Thai Cuisine. We checked Yelp and sure enough Pok Pok was one of the most highly rated Thai joints in the city. We sat down and were immediately greeted by our nasty waiter that threw our menus down and walked away. Returning 30 minutes later with an obnoxious look on his face. I asked after reviewing the menu if they had anything like Lad Nah or Pad See Ew since I didn't see that available. He proceeded to lecture me about how the food they serve at Pok Pok is \\"real thai food\\" and he doesn't know what \\"bastardized american thai food\\" I had been eating. He then tried to bully me into ordering a bunch of dishes I did't want and criticize me for having a shellfish allergy telling me \\"I should just not eat Thai food\\" if I have that kind of allergy. But then end of our conversation I literally wanted to punch the guy. When he walked away no order had been taken. We just got up and walked out. Never walked out on a waiter in a restaurant ever!

It was a nice summer day and the restaurant was surprisingly dead compared to their neighbours. It could be that the other places still had their happy hour going while Anatoli's just ended.We decided to get an appy and a platter to share since we didn't want to carry around any food as we had other plans around downtown right after. - Calamari (4.5/5): Best calamari I've ever had. It doesn't seem hard to mess this one up but you'd be surprised by how many times I've had calamari with soft non-crunch batter or the entire dish just tasted bland with no umph. At Anatoli, their batter is nice and crunch but not overly thick. The calamari is not super soft and tender but that's fine 'cause I still have all my teeth for chewing. - SOUVLAKI PLATTER (3/5): For $31, you get 4 skewers of your choice. You can get it mixed or all of the same protein. We got chicken, pork, prawns and beef (+$1). There were no clear favourites but knowing me, if I really had to choose it'd be beef. As with greek platters, it comes with rice, potatoes and vegetables. I personally liked neither of these. The rice was a bit mushy and the potatoes for some reason was very acidic (not a lemony taste). It tasted like it was boiled with tomatoes in the same pot. The veggies were very bland in taste. No seasoning. Overall the meat skewers were good but the rest of the dish was mushy and acidic.

The place is unusually slow, I actually make it to the drive up speaker.  Since I got there a just a couple minutes after breakfast was supposed to be over I tried to confirm that they would now be serving lunch.  The question completely blew the mind of the idiot on the speaker.  \\"Well i guess it would depend on what you wanted to order...like a biscuit or something\\".  Huh?!  He had just told me breakfast was over, but now he's saying that they're still serving breakfast.  So I asked, \\"what would be the fastest thing I could get\\"... completely blew his mind again.  I told him to forget it and drove around the building to go to the walk up window.  Get to the window, at least three people see me at the window including the manager, no one acknowledges me \\"hey I'll be right with you\\" ... \\"kiss my foot\\" ... nothing.  After several minutes of standing there I get a call I had to take.  I return to the window and its well over twenty minutes into the lunch menu.  I finally get acknowledged and I try to confirm with the manager that they're serving lunch now.  I get the same run around about ... \\"well we could still do a limited breakfast menu and we're getting ready for lunch\\".  So I ask again, \\"what would be the fastest item\\".  This isn't a difficult question, but it was beyond his ability to answer.  Finally he blurts out \\"I can get you what ever you want\\".  I order the most simple basic thing on the menu, a number one.  Guess what they can't produce?  I ask if ordering coleslaw would delay the order \\"absolutely not, the coleslaw is already ready\\", so i ask for coleslaw.  Guess what isn't ready?  and I ask for a LARGE drink.  He leaves to attempt to fill my order, running around like crazy.  Finds a sandwich, a partial order of fries, then the search begins for the slaw.  I finally get my order and start checking it, because I've never gotten a correct order at this location.  Low and behold, guess what isn't correct ... yup, my order ... got a small drink, a partial order of fries and a half order of slaw.  I ask if the drink was a large ... blank stare ... told him to forget it, even though i paid for a large ... I asked if the slaw was the normal portion as it was less than half full and explained that the container had changed since my last visit, so if that was a normal portion I'll take it as is.  He takes the container and i see him running around the store with it.  While I'm waiting, which by now I've been there thirty minutes and I've yet to get my order, I get a call and have to leave.

So this morning, we were lucky enough to get the front table with the bench seat so my 12 mo old daughter can sit. The only way to ensure this is to arrive 10 min after opening. But breakfast was stressful. My daughter wants to feed herself, but she is far below the table and so is frustrated when we feed her. She is also in constant danger of banging her head or falling off the bench when lunging after her falling toys. I love their griddlecakes with bacon IN them. But I didn't really get a chance to enjoy them.Now, not every place has to be baby-friendly. But this place chose to across from a community center, and in the middle of a neighborhood of mostly families, many with young kids if the number on the baby swings across the street are any indication.Sorry baby seat rant over.Second, the Library Fries. I love potatoes. I have a life-long affair with both them and bread. These are terrible. I tried to write something kinder, but in the end honesty has won. They are tasteless and dry most days. And yes, I have eaten them at least 7 times before I stopped ordering anything that comes with them. The house made ketchup is fabulous however, and the potatoes get better covered in them.Their biscuits and gravy are great, especially the sweet potato biscuits and the Sicilian Hash is otherworldly (the potatoes in this are great). The jam  is also a plus.I would love to be a regular.

We will be returning in the next couple of weeks and sitting in the flamenco lounge to catch the show next time. I read that a couple people had problems getting their checks split up but we had no such trouble, in fact our server didn't even have to ask. She came out with our checks and let us know that if we had an issues that she would correct them but all of them were spot on.

They have the very best fries in town and a great burger in your choice of meats. I personally prefer the steak burger.

Prices are about 20% too high for the quality of food they are putting out. If you are making from scratch I'd pay your prices but you can taste that most of this food is purchased from Sysco or similar and put together semi-creatively. Bland and muted flavors symbolic of pre-packaged, vendor purchased food. Take your Sysco investment and hire people to prep quality ingredients fresh and take this place to the level it deserves. Simple, creative dishes made from scratch will always outsell pre-packaged food, dressed up. You're so close! I understand this is marketed as a fine dining establishment but please adjust your liqour margins to the realm of reality. $16 for a 1 oz. pour of Eagle Rare? The whole bottle costs $46 at Twin and your Wellers 12 year, which is better, costs less??? You're above and out of whack with downtown Austin.

And it seemed to be about the same for the people at the tables next to us, who arrived around the same time.Mind you, for a venue of this size, they had plenty of waitstaff, it didn't seem to be a shortage of bodies, just a lack of organization.- Walk in and wait 10 minutes for someone to come over and put us on the wait list\\n- Wait about 20-30 minutes to get a table (many tables were turning over, it was just taking them forever to clear the tables)\\n- Seated, server comes over about 10 minutes later and takes drink order\\n- Server disappears for 20 minutes, comes back with drinks\\n- Server disappears again for 10 minutes\\n- Comes back to take order. Disappears for about 30 minutes after we order the Pancakes (and server tells us \\"We'll do those first, as an appetizer course\\") and a few basic breakfasts\\n- Fifteen minutes later, she comes back with the main meal, and no pancakes. We note this mixup, and that she delivered the \\"fixins\\" (wrong ones, too) for the pancakes, but not the actual pancake batter.\\n- Five minutes later, she's back\\n- Finally, we have everything and can eat. Of course, by then, the kids have had enough, they are super-frustrated and ready to leave.

It was really good and I like the dry age flavor but my preference is to get the large fillet and split it.The sides are family style. You should at least get the jalapeno and creamed corn because it is the house specialty and not to be missed. We also chose the mashed potatoes, mushrooms and twice baked potatoes.

We scrapped the beef for an extra chicken) The couscous and chicken were DE-licious! I would skip the sausage though, every thing else was too fabulous to waste any calories on something that was meerly good.For dessert we had the chocolate thingy that came with homemade sorbet- again, fab!The thing that made this meal even better was the server.

We have been ordering the gluten free pizza with vegan cheese for a couple of years now. At least 1/3 of the time they get it wrong and we have to send it back. However, they've always at least admitted their mistake, apologized and made it right, usually with some sort of compensation for the inconvenience of having to wait longer. It's been quite a while since we've been there and apparently it's now under new management.  We ordered a pizza for my daughter and one for me (the GF pizza are very small). It was to be ready by 5:25. We arrived at 5:30 and waited a while because it was crazy. My daughter's pizza came out with no cheese. When we told the guy, he rolled his eyes and gave it to the manager. She turned without saying a word and took the pizza. 15 minutes later she brought the pizza back with a small amount of vegan cheese sprinkled on the top and then obviously put back through the oven because it was now very well done.

The mistake was totally on my end, because nowhere on the menu is cheese mentioned, but I was let down that it wasn't the creamy dish I imagined. The combo of ingredients would still have been fine and light, except that the chicken tasted like...well, nothing! No flavor at all. Just bland shredded chicken. Still, I was excited for dessert.

Where I have been to C'om a couple of times and enjoyed it, I always thought that their menu represented less value then what I had come to expect from Vietnamese food.  Generally I would stick to the Buford Hwy places that serve heaping bowls of Pho for $7.50 and was pretty happy with it.  So today I decided to give C'om another try.  I was pleased to see that they had a Pho/Spring roll combo as I didn't think they served Pho.  I decided to go for it, and thought $10.50 was a good price for a combo.  What came out was much smaller then what I generally get for $8 elsewhere, but since I wasn't that hungry, I figured all was well.  By the first bite I could tell that the old saying \\"Quality over Quantity\\" absolutely held true here as well.  It had to be one of the best, cleanest tasting Pho broths that I have ever had.  The flavors jumped out, and were easy to discern (star anise, cilantro, beef).  I found the portion to be just perfect.  I left feeling fullfilled, not bloated.  I also didn't feel \\"over salted\\" like I normally do when I leave Vietnamese.From the looks of it, everyone around me were also enjoying their dishes.  I was impressed by the size of their Bahn Mi sandwhiches and presentation.  This place is a step above...well worth the price and visit.

I found the menu to be a bit overwhelming - there are so many different options of bowls, wraps, etc, but when you look loser they all seem to be slight variations on just a few common themes.  The place is quite popular and often busy, and you need to queue up at the counter to order, which doesn't exactly allow for careful study of the menu, so I ended up picking something more or less at random. My friend says she always gets the same thing, but as a first time customer I was kind of overwhelmed.We ended up sitting in the basement, which i found to be a bit musty and stuffy - the upper level was much more airy, open, and pleasant.  As for the food, it was definitely healthy and fresh, but the flavor didn't blow me away.  The Green Goddess was extremely garlicky, which as a garlic fanatic is something I never thought I'd find myself saying. The Hot and Healthy Bachelor was not bad, but grilled veggies were on the watery side.This is definitely a good place to hit if you're feeling under- nourished and in need of a jolt of vitamins, but I can't say I loved it overall.

The food has been consistent with some items good, and some fair.  The shrimp cocktail is consistently very good, and the lobster bisque was quite good the time we tried that.  The seared ahi tuna was average, my wife stated that versions she had tried other places like Smith and Wolensky were better.  We have had the chop salad and spinach salad, and the wedge.  All pretty good.For sides we have had the mac and cheese. the mashed potatoes and the fries.  I could have done without the mac and cheese as it was unremarkable, but the mashed were good and the fries were even better.  The steaks?....they have been ok.  For a less expensive restaurant they would have been 'good' for the prices charged at Mitchells, I would expect more.  The ability to cook to order seems hit and miss, and a couple of times there has not been a lot of flavor in the meat.  Service?...this is my sticking point.  We time our reservations so that we will have a nicely paced meal and then walk to the show. Service has been uneven and decisions mystifying.  Despite having reservations well in advance (I am talking a month plus each time) we seem to be seated in some of the least desirable tables despite the fact that the place is either almost totally empty or less than 1/3 full.  The pace of service is the most inconsistent.  You either have noticeable long waits in between service, or you feel rushed, sometimes in the same meal.  Last visit went like this:  We arrived at 6 to an empty place.  Seated at table that was better than the last few we have had.  Drink order take immediately, but no drinks come for 15 minutes (bar is completely empty).  Food order taken, appetizers take 15 minutes to show up (shrimp are already cooked and tuna is just seared, so what is up?)  Then when apps are removed another 10 minutes for salads, followed 60 seconds later by entrees....no joke, I hadn't even put the second fork of salad in my mouth...server says 'oh, sorry, I will take these back and bring them back in 10 minutes.  Ok, so do you want your cooked to order steak sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen for 10-15 minutes after it is done over cooking and drying out?  So soon after they were taken away we asked for them back.  They should have been tossed and cooked to order again.  Timing was staff error, not mine.  So we are eating our salads and entrees at the same time and now the server won't leave us alone.  Checks multiple times to see if we are done...when there is clearly steak and salad left on 4 plates and we are actively eating.....We continued to get the rush treatment until we left.  As if the place was booked and we were holding up waiting customers.  When we left, the place was still only 1/3 full, maybe a touch more.

The six wings were large, crisp and flavored with a delicious spicy kick. Plum sugar, fish sauce and Thai spices is what I was told went on these delicious birds that will never be able to dream of flying again. The wings are their most popular item, and a must-order for those who have never been to Pok Pok .

Well cooked, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly and very tender, fall apart pork shoulder had my tongue bursting with umami. My friend and I competed for the pieces, as this was a hard dish to share. My main concern about this place, was that the prices are pretty high for the portion sizes. Most their dishes are generally $15.00, and the portions are relatively small (six chicken wings for $14.50). Apparently the food is so good though that it's working for them. Going along with that, rice does not come with anything on the menu, they charge $2.50 for a pretty small serving, and rice is very cheap. The server was very nice, but kept pushing different dishes to us as if what we ordered would not be enough. He kept telling us they're small dishes...ahh. I mean, maybe it wasn't, since I'd like to order everything off their menu. I'd like to be able to afford gas money as well. \\n \\nOther than the food, I also loved the atmosphere of this place.

So here I am, standing here for a good 3-4 minutes and they're holding a full conversation in front of me....Our server, while it was her 2nd day on the job, was polite and nice.

On top of my food being input incorrectly and receiving a very skimpy portion of food for $15, I sent the plate back and ordered something else. About 5 min later, a manager (server said his name is Jordan) came over and asked if there was a problem. Before  I could finish my initial statement, he cut me off and proceeded to talk over me telling me that they use a high quality steak and it's only 4oz (not noted on the menu). I let him know I've eaten here many times and have always received more steak than that. His response was \\"Well those times you were given extra.\\" In addition to his very arrogant attitude he said that the other dish I ordered instead was not put in because there was my steak plate that had already been made.

I'm getting really tired of these cheap Chinese restaurants trying to squeeze every little dime out of the customer. Not only do they not give you rice with your $13.50 entree (what's the cost to produce it, like 5 cents for a tea cup full?) they recently instituted a minimum $15 credit card limit. Like seriously? You are charging me $13.50 for oily chicken and you are worried about a 3% margin? She told me to remember to bring cash next time. You know what I remembered to do?

Although I do not drink much, this is definitely my (and my husband's) favorite place to go for a drink.  The cocktails are expertly crafted and I find the service impeccable.Casey is our favorite server and she is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and can quickly come up with suggestions for people that are not experienced with craft cocktails.  Travis is also an extremely talented person who takes his time (just enough) creating each cocktail. I appreciate the fact that he does not rush making drinks as I know that my peach blow fizz will be shaken until it arrives delightfully frothy at my table. For those that do not have the understanding, palate or patience for this quality of product and talent, please stick to 6th street as your clueless ratings are unjustly lowering what should be a five star rating.6/17/13- Just went for my first Tiki night. I did not realize that they did not offer drinks off the regular menu so I was a bit disappointed 'at first'. However, after leaving my comfort zone (with Casey's gentle encouragement), I was delighted with the drinks that I did try. The ingredients of the Mai Tai Swizzle looked a bit intimidating (not a grapefruit fan or absinthe) but Travis's talent in blending just the right amount of each ingredient resulted in a nice refreshing drink with a slight tropical flair. I muddled my mint garnish toward the end of the drink and loved the minty twist at the end. My daughter had the Missionary Downfall and we ALL loved it. The drink was not too sweet and the lime and mint made for a very refreshing pleasant cocktail! I also had a pina colada. I almost did not order this as I am not a huge  pina colada fan but... this was perfect. Not too sweet, perfect coconut (almost toasted taste) flavor and just...wonderful. I and the three others in our group declared it the best pina colada we have ever had. The drinks were gorgeous to look at with the fancy glasses and garnishments.

The lobster roe noodles ($34) would be my choice of entree. The braised short ribs are so tender and succulent and there is a good amount of lobster chunks in the meal. As I would normally say: if I were in the comforts of my own home...I would lick this plate clean. The service is awesome and waiters are attentive. Dirty plates are cleared quickly.

The atmosphere of the dining room is not as austere as more traditional places often are.  The dining room is very dim, buzz factor is high and there's a nice lounging area outside for smoking cigars.  The large portrait of Kevin Rathbun hanging on the wall is characterful if a little creepy.  I've eaten aged and non-aged steaks here of a number of varieties.  I always felt the food just meets the high expectations you are bound to come with.  The steaks are good, just not the most amazing steak for the price (starting from about $50).  The 8 or so sauces you can select to enhance the flavor often steal the show.  I am not a purist when it comes to steaks so this is okay, though a couple times I feel like this is no different than getting a good steak entree from Rathbun's just down the street (which is excellent), if I have to dress the steak with truffle or blue cheese butter.  The side dishes on the other hand really shine, showcasing the powerful flavoring that Rathbun is known for.  I highly recommend getting a number of side dishes among the table to share.  Everything from the sonoma mushrooms, brussels sprouts with bacon, jalapeno creamed corn, to the heart-attack inducing mashed potatoes with butter emphasis on the butter, are luxuriously seasoned and beautifully executed, classic Rathbun.  The bar is there to give you what you need, which at a place where many people are eating off expense account means expensive wine and simple stiff expensive browns.  Mixed drinks can be made when instructed to but nothing interesting is presented to you.  Meets high expectations.

All in all, it took just over two hours from when I ordered to when I got the food, partly because the driver first went to my address, in Boston. On to the food. The pho hit the spot but wasn't the best I ever had. The meat portion seemed meager - 4 slices of rare steak in the small? They also didn't include any jalapeno slices with all the trimmings. The summer rolls were pretty weak, I think summer rolls usually have cabbage and these had lettuce. You wouldn't think they'd be that different but it was definitely noticeable. And the shrimp to roll ratio was weak, I was definitely not getting shrimp in every bite. The roti and curry was good, essentially a flat scallion pancake with thai green curry sauce. And the kao soi (ordered based on a yelper's review) was a pretty interesting mix of flavors, i'd def get that again. Bottom line: I'd order from here only if I wasn't super hungry and desperate for pho delivery. But def not the spring rolls.

In the previous review i somewhat voiced my concern over how salty their ramen bowls were but after our recent visit (in two years!) i am pleased that they had used alternatives in their ingredients for the ramen bowls. We had come here on friday night and ordered the R2 bowl as well as the R2 combo meal. Everything was great. However i can't really give them the full 5 stars because although the food was great, I just felt like something was missing from the ramen bowls that used to be there before. Hmmm....I just cannot seem to put my finger on it but perhaps it was the shredded fungus, maybe the seaweed, and it definitely lacked some bamboo shoots in there. I remember it used to be so proportional that I thought it was amazing for the price. Their hokkaiyaki appetizer was a bit way toooo cheesy for me. I would prefer it to be spicy rather than cheese-filled. BUT cheese-lovers would love it. I got tired of eating it by the time i got to 1/2 of the shell. However, I definitely would be back again.

I offered to pay for my entire order so that it would make it quicker the next day when I picked it up. The lady behind the counter pulled my ticket & said that  my order for 50 would be ready later that day.  I told her that I called a week ago & changed the pickup date to Saturday & she said that she would tell the baker to stop baking.  I called Saturday morning at 10am & asked if my order was ready.  The owner, Robert said that my order was ready & waiting for me.  I asked him if they were baked this morning & he said 'yes'.  When I arrived to pick up my order I asked again, was my order baked this morning & Robert said no, that he misspoke on the phone & that my order was for yesterday.  I explained to him that I called a week ago & changed the pick up date and that I was in his store yesterday and told his employee that it had been changed to Saturday.  Then he continues to tell me that all large orders are baked the day before and asked what the problem was.  I told him that they are no longer fresh.  You will not believe what the OWNER said to me...'If you don't like it, you don't have to come back because I can sell my breads'.  He has day old product that he sells at a discount because they are 'A Day Old'.  He did not offer to refund any portion of my money because now he is selling me day old bread.

I spent a few weeks in South Thailand and must say the flavors at this restaurant are spot on.First off, the water you get at your table is cloudy because there is pandan leaf in it, giving almost a floral coconut flavor. The famed chicken wings are 6 for $12. Very expensive in any town (this elevates it to BonChon status, if you know what I mean) but worth trying. The wings are super salty for my taste but are delicious. They are caramelized with red peppper flakes, fish sauce and sesame seeds and you must chase the wings with some rice to quell the saltiness. I love chewing on the tiny wing tip. The papaya salad is $8. The half hen special is $12.50, it comes with 1/2 a roast hen, papaya salad, sticky rice and 2 dipping sauces. It is so good. The dipping sauces were impressive. The complexities and nuances of using SE Asian herbs here are well done.Everything is a winner, I am serious.

First, the meats on their Italian Sub ($5.25) are the right blend of Mortadella, Genoa Salami and Pepperoni (I would've liked to see some Capicola but hey).

Following up is the hot peppers they use, not the rings but the finely diced hot peppers that add heat to every bite.  The bread is little soft but the length was generous and held a hefty sandwich for the price. The chopped onion/tomato relish that goes on it is tasty with the olive oil and spice but a bit messy.The only points I would take off would be that the everything comes with pickles. I mean pickles?

At first I didn't pay it any mind. We were then seated in the back of the restaurant despite plenty of tables being open near the entrance and in the center. And only one other group came in after us and they were seated in the middle of the restaurant. Strange huh? Didn't pay that any mind either. They brought us our menus but it was the weekend of the SEC Championship so they had a game day menu. I was fine with that until I realized the food options were not so hot. So I asked our waitress what she would prefer from two of the options and she gave me a runaround answer that sounded like she either didn't know what the food was like or she didn't wanna tell me. I ended up ordering the Ivy Burger (which was honestly an average burger with bacon and lettuce on it) and the entire time, there was a worker near the entrance that just stared at us. I don't know if he was undercover security or a cook on break or whatever but he literally stared at us the entire time we ate. And he tried to be slick by looking at us then elsewhere and he was so obvious.On top of all of this, it was something along the line of 45 degrees yet they decided to have the doors open and windows open. And their heaters were the weakest heaters I've ever seen. The only person who seemed cool throughout this experience was the police officer outside.Overall, the food was average, the service wasn't too great, and I don't really like to be stared at when I'm eating.

For Thanksgiving break, I visited Orlando with my boyfriend. And both of us being from Guangdong, were craving some dim sum for lunch, so I searched all over Yelp to see where we could get some. Apparently, there is a limited amount of Chinese food in general in Orlando and the only place I saw with actual pictures of dim sum was Golden Lotus!Initially, I was deterred by the low rating and the reviews and from the pictures, the restaurant looked pretty rundown. BUT, boy am I glad we did! The food was authentic and flavorful, exactly what Cantonese food is known for! They actually have a pretty good selection too and a handout with pictures to show what each dim sum looked like for those who are probably new to this concept.AND the restaurant is nothing like the pictures I saw on here! They probably renovated it recently and it feels very clean. The service isn't like five-star dining, but the staff were nice! And the food definitely came faster than I expected since I read reviews of it being so slow, but we experienced none of that.I really hadn't expected such quality dim sum in Orlando, since the Asian population isn't that big.

Cheap cheap.  My entire bill was under $15 including a beer.  I was a little stunned on how cheap my meal was.  Why the 3 stars?  well... the food sushi isn't all that great.

Although the place was packed, the greeter at the door was calm and had everything under control. Great first impression. We checked out the menu while waiting for a table, and were beyond impressed by the variety of options. We ended up ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes, chilaquiles with chipotle chicken, berry stuffed French toast, and prosciutto with roasted fig jam and arugula Benedict. The food was outstanding! The service was fantastic, warm, and friendly. The prices were reasonable and well in line with what we expected.

It's out of the way for me, but after a claim like that, it didn't matter.The first bad sign was the crowd of people that could be seen a few blocks before arriving at the restaurant.  Of course, that's also good sign meaning it's a popular place, but I hate to wait - especially for breakfast when I'm already starving.  But once again...biscuits and gravy making love, so we waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  At least an hour to get the 2 crappy bar seats at the window (the uncomfortable, not so stable, crowded in an unlikely spot kind of seat).We both ordered the biscuits and gravy, how could we not?  It was a long wait for them also, about 40 minutes, and by then we were both so damn hungry that it was hard to tell if they were really as tasty as our friend said they were.  In retrospect, probably nothing better than some light, over the clothes, petting.  Making love in my stomach?  No.  Pretty darn good, though.We took home a couple of the chocolate pistachio macaroons - overly salty for my taste. The salty-sweet combo is all the rage now, but this was way too salty for me.In the end, I'm indifferent about this place:  good food, but long wait."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I kept hearing people rave about this place during the summer.

What makes this place amazing is that when I bring my friends from out of town here or small parties everything runs so smoothly. It's really disappointing that every other place can't copy their DNA. Not that every place should be the same but when I think of dining out or showing someone a good time I always call Rathbun's first.

As many Yelpers have noted, the lobster roe pasta is great, but their fish is often overlooked. Definitely try their fish. Also, the only thing I haven't absolutely loved on their menu is their oyster sliders. But why would you want to eat fried oysters at a place that has such delicious raw oysters anyway?"},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You know the score already: no reservations, no credit cards, no exceptions.I was invited to an early dinner/late lunch (linner?) at Daily Catch, and I felt very privileged and lucky to have the chance to check out this North End staple. Across the street from Mike's Pastry (at which the line was LITERALLY around the block, I'd never seen that before in mid-Feb), The Daily Catch can only be described as a restaurant kitchen surrounded by 6 tables. There are no frills here, no reservations, no name at the door, just stand in line and wait your turn. If you forget and reach for the door handle before your turn, you will surely be reminded by the dozen or so very vocal people that have been waiting to get in, OR the hostess (epitome of Italian-aunt-who-will-definitely-kick-your-ass-if-you-step-out-of-line) will simply kick you out. As one regular told me in line, she once said \\"If you don't like it, get the hell out\\". At 3:30pm, we ended up waiting about 40 minutes, but we missed one table because our group wasn't complete (they will only seat you if everyone in your party is present). However, the next table for four was conveniently bussed and cleaned very slowly, giving my fella enough time to find parking and leg it back to the restaurant. A wink and a nod from the hostess and we were in. They are well known for their squid ink pasta ($28 with any protein), but our table stuck to regular fare, starting with their famous calamari. Holy crickey. Served with their tangy and tomato-y marinara, this calamari is perfectly cooked, with breading clinging like lichen to a brick wall on every piece. Why can't every plate of calamari be cooked like this? Looking at you, EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT. A small order for 2 ($9.75) was enough to satisfy our table of four.For entrees, I had the linguini with scallops, fella had the linguini with scallops and shrimp, fella's mom had the same and fella's dad had the haddock. All were priced $19-$22 each. The pasta dishes come in the frying pan, clearly the most rugged pans ever made as they were dented and scrubbed within an inch of their life and still cooked up some perfect scallops. I also tried the shrimp and they were also very well cooked, not rubbery (overcooked). The portions are huge, but I scarfed down most of mine, I couldn't resist their garlicky white sauce.We stuck to water so early in the day, which came in plastic cups (no ice, which I applaud!), but they gladly brought us a dish of lemon to spritz in the water. We were all surprised to see how young the cook was (couldn't be a year over 25, could he have been one of the sons?), and he produced plate after plate of delicious, perfectly cooked food, without making a sound. He's a one-man operation, which is good because there would be no room for a sous-chef. The space of the restaurant is 60% kitchen (stove, salamander, counter, storage, dishroom) and 40% seating. There is one waitress, aided by the hostess. The menu is a chalkboard. Parking is impossible. The North End is pretty much 100% resident parking, with some lots for non-residents strewn here or there. Some side streets near The Daily Catch do have metered spots, but you'd have to have some excellent parking karma to snag one of those. TDC validates 3hrs of parking at the garage at the Garden, but if you're waiting in line for a while, you might get hit with some over-time fees. More convenient to park somewhere else and take the T. There is plenty of North End atmosphere here (a family-run Italian restaurant in the heart of Boston), and that's all you need when the food is this good. It's not a tourist trap, in my opinion - the line outside was populated mostly by regulars who entertained us with tales of the Daily Catch staff and family. I've heard the other locations aren't as great, but if you're going for Italian seafood, try this one out."},{"name":"Wings Over Somerville","address":"519 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"Wings is delicious, simple, convenient and dependable!We always end up getting the boneless because I hate eating stuff with bones, and we generally stick to the West Texas Mesquite (tastes like BBQ chips!) and the Honey Mustard.

It wasn't terrible, but they used American cheese as the filing...I don't wanna hate but clearly there was nothing 'special' about that at all.The worst part of the whole experience was having to stand in line while the music blared and the workers being more focused on singing along to the song versus fulfilling your order.

To her defense, it was really busy, and all the wait staff were running around waiting tables plus given how hot it was in there I wasn't going to give her a hard time. She was friendly though and the last time she walked by our table she did say she would be right with us.So we get our food about 20 minutes after we order..not bad. I got the chicken nachos and my wife got the 2 chili cheese dogs. I have to say I've had better nachos before. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad, but I've definitely had better. My wife's meal wasn't bad either. I think the fact that it was so hot in there really killed it for us, and the hostesses-es aren't that personable. News flash that's YOUR job!! You're greeting and seating customers. Anyways, I don't get how this place did not make sure the A/C's would be working properly on a game day, and with it being over 100 degrees that day.

I just got back from a Portland trip over the weekend, ate here for the 4th time, but was really excited because I got to take my Mom here who was raised in Thailand. She was pleasantly surprised by their food. The famous chicken wings are definitely the chef's own recipe, but it does have roots in Vietnamese Lemongrass style. But as for everything else we tried my Mom said it was authentic the way things are supposed to be prepared in Thailand.   I wish the wait wasn't so long, but our 2.5-3. hour wait time turned out to only be 1.5 hours which is fair for 7 pm on a Saturday. We hung out at a nearby bar and had french fries and beer to keep ourselves busy. PokPok is the best, I already miss the wings.

But the human attention span is what, like 7 min? I will try to keep this as short as possible but it is oh so difficult to not go on and on about this place!\\nI wish I could give, like, 400 stars! What great food and service! I really pity other restaurants because ICOB has set the bar so high that it is hard to beat! I came here 3 or 4 times during the first two weeks December, when I was snowed in twice from my vacation. At that time, ICOB had only been open about two months or so. I have been here probably 15 or more times since then. I come in weekly at a minimum, and have a drink after work/school.\\nFirst of all, the ambiance is great. It reminds me of New York - modern and kind of trendy, but not obnoxious. It's not crazy dark, so you can still see what you are eating and what is going on around you. The Bar is split into two sections, the regular part, where you can drink and order apps I think, and the Dining bar, where I sit every time. I have yet to sit at a table!\\nReservations are a good idea-it is always packed, even on a Tuesday.\\nFrom the minute you walk in, the Maitre D' Ashley and other hostesses welcome you with heartfelt smiles, as if they were having you for dinner at their own home. And that's really how the experience continues. Jackson the bar director (who just won best bartender in Boston!), and Devin, T, and Vic and the other bartenders are super knowledgable and really happy to assist with anything you need, whether it's a drink or an opinion.\\nThe food...the food is amazing! You really can't go wrong with anything you order. The oysters are, of course, fantastic. They have a good variety, and the staff can point you in the right direction and make suggestions if you are an oyster newbie. The casserole is great on a cold day. The lobster roe noodles are to DIE for, probably my favorite! And they have an delicious burger, too, if you go with someone not as fond of seafood! For dessert you MUST try the rosemary bread pudding. I am not a huge fan of bread pudding in general, but this is like nothing else I have had. My fav desert ever! Be sure to ask about half orders, as some dishes can be made smaller. \\nAnd let's not forget BRUNCH! YES people! They have Sunday brunch! I had a lobster omelette with homefries and it was delicious! Rich and savory but very light! Usually with home fries I can take 'em or leave 'em but these I practically inhaled! And my bloody mary was just right, a little on the spicy side. Of course you can always ask for subs/accommodations and see if they can suggest anything.\\nOh, and ICOB is Eastern Standard Kitchen's little sister. Totally different foods but same brains behind the magic. Yeah, they kinda know what they are doing.Enjoy! Tell them Julie sent you ;-)PS-In case you read a review that complains about the noise level, it is no louder than any other restaurant/bar!

If you're a fan of raw bar, this is the place to order it. The oysters are so fresh and cold and the pink peppercorn mignonette is one of a kind. They also have a full bar with an array of interesting cocktails and a very decent wine selection. The Pimms Cup and the Summertime Setback are two of my favorite spring/summer cocktails because they are so light and refreshing. Although the food is upscale the feel of the restaurant is very comfortable and friendly.The owner makes his rounds in the dining room and the service is always excellent.

The bar is well stocked and the bar staff is knowledgeable which is important to me because I enjoy classic, well-made cocktails.  My old fashioned with sazerac rye was great. \\nNow the bad news. They delivered a bad first impression by handing me one of those light up coasters to let me know our table was ready.  I'd expect this from a lesser establishment.  The host staff should be smart enough to keep track of everyone and keep it personal. \\nThe bartender forgot to put our order in so it took a while to get our food.

The spicy chicken (sorry, can't remember the name) was tasty. Unlike most Korean chicken dishes where the chicken is typically deep fried, this one was simply saut√©ed in the spicy sauce. About he only thing I didn't like about that dish was that there were more onions than chicken in the dish. I had to dig through the mounds of onions to find the pieces of chicken. I found the service to be minimal. Even though it wasn't busy at all, I only got service three times:  when I ordered, when the server brought the food out, and when I flagged the waitress down for the bill. All of the other time, unless the one waitress was doing the same as above for other customers, she was nowhere to be seen.  To be fair, she was friendly enough.  She was just not trying too hard to service people and earn bigger tips. Again, the food was great enough to overlook the service and earn four stars in my books."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"With color coded rooms connected by labyrinthine corridors and stairs, Powell's is like Roy G.

The waiter was really friendly too.  He noticed my friend's Overwatch shirt and immediately started geeking out with us about the characters from the game.  Food choices were all pretty typical except for a couple I saw that looked really enticing. For me, the boneless buffalo chicken appetizer is usually a good measure of the quality and taste of the food I'm about to get, and I'm happy to say they were truly awesome.  As was the spinach and artichoke dip. Nothing tasted frozen, although in reality I know they probably all were. For my main, I had the quesadilla burger and it was glorious.  Super greasy and a bit messy but incredibly flavorful.  I honestly want to just thank the person who thought that up.  For dessert, I was torn between a bunch of items, but decided to play it safe with the apple fritter.  I figured it's \\"Applebee's\\", not \\"Browniebee's\\" or \\"Bananabee's\\".  If there's one dessert that would be good it would be this one. And it was.  Don't get me wrong, it's no Homemade Apple Tart from the south of France, but it was incredibly delicious... and that's all I could ask for really.

But not in an uncomfortable way, in a charming engaging way. The lighting was warm, the wood beams on the ceiling added a special touch. The patrons seemed quite lovely as well. Anyway, on to the food... Our waiter was a young man who resembled Screech, a lot. Screech with a beard. We decided to skip appetizers (something I now regret), and immediately went for Entrees. My boyfriend ordered the Steak au Poivre, which he claims was the best steak he has ever had. The waiter came over with the knife for it and said \\"your weapon sir\\" when he placed it. It really livened us up, we were nervous being the youngest people there. I ordered the Sea Bass, and let me tell you, I'm not a fish person, but it melted on my tongue and had the most pleasant flavor. We both ordered sides of mashed potatoes per the waiter's suggestion. I had a when Harry Met Sally moment over this. Eyes rolled back and all I could say was \\"oh my god, oh my god\\". Boyfriend had a similar reaction. The mashed potatoes actually made my night.

It's a chill atmosphere for small meetings or studying, though the furniture is somewhat uncomfortable.  It's on the pricey side, but the staff is friendly and they don't have a credit card minimum...something that seems more and more difficult to find (here's looking at you, Bennu).By night, Thunderbird's other side emerges, and the clientele seems to change accordingly.

Feeling adventurous,  I ordered the chicken and waffles. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and we split a farm salad. The salad was fresh and flavorfull, the grits were creamy and delicious. The chicken and waffles were good the savory gravy, syrup and butter was served on the side. The chicken tenders were good but similar to the frozen that I have purchased from the store. I tried a traditional southern dish but wish I would have ordered a Moonshine specialty. All in all our experience was very good and service was fantastic.After dinner, we asked about live music with a \\"coffee house\\" vibe. Michael suggested Rainey street a few blocks away. It was the perfect end to our day, check it out after dinner!"},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've eaten here 4 times in 30 years...every time I go to Boston.

Located in downtown Portland's Pearl District, this bookstore is supposedly the largest used and new bookstore in the world.  Who is tracking this?  I don't know.  Whether true or not, it's an impressive store.  There are 9 color-coded rooms.  There is someone to answer questions as you enter the store to answer questions.   It was easy to find selections and shelves were neat and nicely categorized.I was expecting crowds and lots of squeezing by others in narrow aisles, but I found myself comfortably browsing through many aisles without any problems.  It was quiet and everyone seemed very respectful of their space, just like a library should be :)Don't forget to stop by the Basil Hallward Gallery, located upstairs in the Pearl Room) as well as the Rare Book Room for one of a kind books.For the budding authors, their Espresso Book Machine gives anyone the power to publish a book.Easy to find - just look for the statue across the street!store hours: 9am - 11pm daily\\nsell us your books: 9am - 8pm daily\\nrare book room: 11am - 7pm daily"},{"name":"Finale","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Out of all 3 locations I like this one the best. Always get better service at Coolidge Corner location. Love most of their dessert menu, however am not a fan of some (Those are the ones that I have found to be better at other places in Boston).The seasonal desserts are usually awesome, had the apple seasonal special once and it was even better then the Apple a La Mode (which is pretty good already).I would recommend having their Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e, Butterscotch Pudding, or if you are with a certain someone try the Dessert Sampler. Although it is primarily a dessert place ordered the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese once and it was pretty good.Coffee is pretty good. Have a great (though a bit on expensive side) Dessert and Ice wine selection.PS become a member of sweet rewards if you are regular here. It's free and you get free desserts also."},{"name":"What's Brewin' Cafe","address":"198 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"I read a review of What's Brewin' Cafe here on Yelp and vowed to check it out the next time I found myself in Beverly. Luckily for me, it was easy to find (near the end of Cabot St.) and it wasn't busy at all so I was able to peruse the menu and get to interact with the man behind the counter.The numerous flavors they offer for lattes is just amazing. Crazy flavor combos that I wouldn't have thought up in a million years. And the price, at just under $4, is reasonable. The drinks are 1 size, and that size would equal a large at most places. I tried the iced butterscotch mocha and it was so sweet- I felt like I was about to go into sugar shock halfway through! As a crazed caffeine addict, it was not the strongest drink that I've had; I think those flavored lattes are more about the sweet flavors rather than the amount of caffeine. I didn't try any of the sandwiches, but had I had more time (and more money on me since it's cash only), I definitely would have. They had a large variety, and the prices were decent. The man behind the counter was cute, and very engaging- which is always a bonus!My only complaint is the fact they are cash only. I don't know many people who carry more than a few dollars these days, especially if you're a tourist. The sign was not displayed very prominently so a person could be waiting in a long line before noticing it. All in all though, the coffee was amazing. If you want a unique coffee flavor combination, I recommend What's Brewin' Cafe!"},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"400 Cochituate Rd","city":"Framingham","stars":"2","text":"I absolutely love panera.

I loved the Fish Sauce wings...my mouth is watering thinking about it. That is a must order if you eat meat. The Khao Soi was also some of the best I've had outside of Thailand, which is hard to find. The Morning Glory was a bit under seasoned, but it was a quick fix with the chili fish sauce condiment.Overall really liked this place and had a great Thailand feel, complete with the standard vinyl table cloths.

I had the mushroom salad and although it was a little smaller (I was warned), it tasted authentic.  My wife has the special which I think was half a cornish game hen.  We even had dessert.  I went with the ice cream on bread.  This is very traditional as in Thailand, this is how it is served--mainly because they do not have ice cream cones.
