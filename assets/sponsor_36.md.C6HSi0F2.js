Luckily, there was seating at the bar, and while it was a bit cramped (and right on top of the hostess station) we took it. \\n\\nI would have sat on the floor for that French toast. It's two giant slices of crusty bread, golden and toasty, propped up over a small pool of maple syrup flavored with orange flower water. I usually freak out when the syrup touches the bread, but this was just the perfect amount of syrup, besides, the French toast had a thick enough skin it didn't get soggy.( I absolutely hate mushy wet bread, but this was perfectly cooked on the outside and soft in the center without being wet.) It was also served with fresh whipped cream made with real vanilla, and a slice of orange. Previous reviews have mentioned the coffee, and with a hot steamy cup and this FT...Heaven.  I also ordered a side of bacon, and while I flinched at the price ($4), I was pleased that I got at least 6 slices. \\n\\nThe mimosas looked strong and were made with fresh juice (orange, grapefruit, or pomagrate), and at $5 were tempting, but I couldn't tear myself away from the coffee. My date had an amazing cocktail which I'll leave him to comment on, and the eggs Benedict. The Benedict was served with potato instead of an English muffin which I thought was neat. \\n\\nAlso unique was the offering of fried green tomatoes as a breakfast side. Doesn't strike me as Mediterranean, but what do I know? And who cares, because they were great. They were done up with a cornmeal batter and served with a lemon aioli. Good stuff. \\n\\nThe Host made out seating situation less awkward by making conversation and it turns out Fino hasn't been open for brunch very long.

Our bartender/server was equally friendly - all in all service was excellent. \\n\\nThe vibe of this place was very classy and I felt undressed in jeans and a henley. Would have loved to sit outside on their huge patio - with high celings, and bamboo hanging \\"curtains\\" partially enclosing the space. I would return here in a heartbeat if it wasn't so expensive. We had a $30 Groupon and still owed $18 (one cocktail, coffee, two brunch entrees, and two breakfast sides).

My band recently played a show here and I am completely baffled by the lack of professionalism. The bands were told to be there by 7pm for sound check. We show up at 7 and not a single employee from the venue was there nor did any show up for at least another hour to hour and a half later. Later in the night the owner decided he wasn't making enough money so he cut the band off mid song and told everyone to leave. This is very unprofessional. The band had traveled all the way from New Jersey to come play a show in Atlanta and this is the treatment they get? The venue did nothing to promote the show. The sound guy had no clue what he was doing, everyone on stage just sounded like a big muddled mess. These guys need to figure out that if you are going to have a bar/venue in EAV then you need to keep the bands happy bc they are the ones bringing out the crowds.

Only a week or so beforehand, I'd been chatting with a new-ish resident of Austin who told me his favorite pub from his hometown of San Antonio was The Lion and Rose. He said it was the perfect venue to watch soccer, drink beer, and do whatever the hell else it is straight guys like to do with their buddies. Imagine his surprise when I told him they had an Austin location, and that's pretty much what goes on out there, too. He also inquired if I knew any other good places to hang out in Austin...to which I responded that neither of us had the time to go into THAT much detail in person, so I linked him to my Yelp reviews and told him to knock himself out. But I digress. \\n\\nKat was in full command of the bar when I arrived, and it's always nice to see her in action. It also appeared she knew every single person at the bar, which she confirmed after giving me a big hug. \\"It's like 'Cheers' up in here!\\" she explained, and as long as no one resembling that insufferable Shelley Long was around, I found the comparison cute.\\n\\nI perused the menu, but only as a habit. I knew before going in I wanted to try their bangers and mash. Last time, I had the fish and chips and sampled the Shepherd's pie; in keeping with the British theme, I chose the aforementioned dish. Plus, I can still hear Karen Walker telling off some British guy by declaring: \\"You're not getting your banger anywhere near my mash.\\"\\n\\nYou will never have to worry about portions at The Lion and Rose. Three large, succulent sausages were in front of me in no time. Speaking of which...God, I miss my 20's. Make sure to try the parmesan-crusted tomatoes; they're one of my favorite sides after the Guinness mac-n-cheese. \\n\\nAs I ate my delicious meal, I noticed the crowd was surprisingly mixed. There were two attractive couples who were knocking back a few Jamesons; a regular who is known for wearing a different quirky T-shirt each time he comes in; a young guy who was talking \\"best beer bars in Austin\\"; and an older gentleman who works from home and can afford to have lunch and margaritas on a Friday afternoon. They were eclectic, to say the least, but the vibe was upbeat, and the cross-talk among the patrons was friendly and amusing. Kat was the perfect ringmaster, joining in the conversation without missing a beat in service. \\n\\nFor my dessert, I told Kat she could surprise me. And she did, with the sticky toffee pudding. The layers of warm, moist sponge cake topped with a luscious toffee sauce was one of the sweetest desserts I'd had in a long time. It tasted like one giant gooey Worther's candy. It was wonderful. This is definitely a dessert that is so rich and sweet, it can be split among several people; otherwise, I'd schedule an appointment with the dentist immediately.\\n\\nBefore I left to my next adventure, I discovered all kinds of events go on up at The Lion and Rose. Monday Happy Hours include on-special pints; there are rotating schedules for pub trivia and karaoke nights; and of course they have all the current sports blasting on their myriad of televisions for you to enjoy. Apparently it's soccer season now, and I only know this because some guy talked my ear off the other day about Euro Cup qualifying matches, and I watched a Greece vs. Czech game on mute when I was on the treadmill at the gym. (N.B.: I have a feeling these games are solely meant to be watched with friends and a few pints at  a place like The Lion and Rose. Otherwise, they seem kind of pointless). \\n\\nAll in all, it was another pleasant visit to my favorite Westlake pub. If you haven't already, give it a try. And ask for Kat: she will be more than happy to serve up some good food, cold pints, and a whole lot of fun. \\n\\nUntil then, pip pip cheerio, and all that sort of rot.\\n\\n4 Stars."},{"name":"Angels Auto Spa & Cafe","address":"712 W Lake Mary Blvd","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was great.

Though the specialize in soba, they also offer other Japanese food like sushi (more rolls), and small dishes since it's an izakaya. \\nThe restaurant is surprisingly very large but doesn't have that many tables. It is bright, modernly decorated, and most importantly, feels spacious, which I like... I hate all those really crowded restaurants where you're up in your neighbor's dinner conversation. \\nUNI SOBA. UNI SOBA. UNI SOBA. \\nWe came for lunch and I tried the uni (sea urchin) cold soba. They give you dashi sauce/broth to dip the noodles in which is very good. The uni was pretty fresh which is great-- so nice and creamy... and it comes with ikura which balances it out with its saltiness. For those of you who haven't had uni, this could be a good place for you to try it. Old uni is rather gross and would traumatize any first-timer. \\nI was pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when they brought out the hot water that they used to cook the noodles in and recommended we mix it with the leftover soba broth. It has a lot of nutrients from the noodles but doesn't have much flavor on its own, however, when coupled with the dashi broth, it's yummy! This is also really affordable for uni, at a price of $16!!!! Unbeatable!! \\n\\nRight now, they are offering 15% off lunch until they get a lunch menu (right now it's just the dinner menu with dinner prices).

Most of the decor was nice being that it was modeled after the ballroom in Beauty and the Beast too but I hated how it was incredibly loud (I guess that's to be expected, considering there are tons of children... it is a theme park after all) and basically looked like a diner with fancy chairs.  It also was cute how they play fanfare music and announce the Beast every so often, then you are given the chance to meet him and take pictures.  Although, I'm an adult woman, the little girl in me, who fell in love with the movie Beauty and the Beast, was super excited to meet the Beast.  He was a perfect gentleman. I digress.\\n\\nThe food was great for the most part, the only miss really being the mussels.  The mussels were pretty good for the most part but some didn't look like they were cleaned well (there was sand) and others weren't fresh and dead (they were closed).  The crostinis that came with the mussels were delicious and went well with the broth.  The entrees were delicious. My party ordered the pork chop, shrimp and scallop pasta and I had the ratatouille.  I was hoping the ratatouille would look like the movie's dish but it didn't.  It was delicious, nonetheless.  I ate the whole thing.  I loved the quinoa with it because it added a nice texture to the dish.  The pork chop was great.  Not only was it was tender and seasoned beautifully but it had a delicious puree to accompany it.  This pork chop was far superior to the California Grill.  The pasta was also delicious.  It was full of flavor and everything was seasoned right.  The table all cleaned out our entrees and collectively agreed this restaurant was a winner.\\n\\nDessert!  As a little girl, I had always dreamed about trying \\"the grey stuff\\".  If you don't know what that's a reference to, it's in reference to the song, \\"Be Our Guest\\" from Beauty and the Beast, where Lumiere sings, \\"... try the grey stuff, it's delicious!  Don't believe me?  Ask the dishes!\\"  What was in this grey stuff?  Anything grey is/sounds unappetizing, right?  That's what I thought as a child.  I had always wanted to try this \\"grey stuff\\" and find out if it really is delicious because Belle's face looked like she loved it when she tried it.

I moved back home to Houston, but I ate here over the weekend before a friend's wedding. I wanted to make sure I was full enough to last me till the dinner reception. Haha. I've tried the same dish at other restaurants in Houston, and it just doesn't compare. They serve a large portion with shredded chicken and mashed avocado on top. Then, it's breaded and topped with suiza sauce, cheddar cheese, and a slice of avocado. The suiza sauce goes well with the dish because it's got a sour cream taste with a spicy kick. The breading adds a nice crisp to every bite. It's served with rice and beans. I've tried their flan for dessert, and I also love it because it's thick and creamy and reminds me of how Filipinos make flan, which is the only way I'll eat it. My parents ordered the fajitas for two, and they each got served their own portion of sizzling fajita. I've never ordered fajitas here before, but we were expecting one dish for two to share. It's a pretty big serving for two compared to other TexMex restaurants. My parents enjoyed it and liked the lemon flavor the meat had. It didn't taste bland. It's also served with tortillas, rice, beans, guacamole, and pico de gallo. While you're waiting for your food to come out, they serve chips and salsa. The chips were overly salted, and I had to dust off the salt. The place is a little rundown now. There's a bar and more seating upstairs. We ate upstairs because they were busy, and we needed to be seated right away to make it in time for the wedding ceremony. It's pretty dark upstairs, which makes it hard to see the menu.

HOWEVER what we got was flavorless hard pieces of fried rubber served with sweet chili sauce?! I got our server's attention and informed him that I ordered the agedashi tofu and this was not agedashi tofu. He then asked me what agedashi tofu was, explaining that he was new and not familiar with the menu. He then took the problem to the chef. He came back to our table and told me the dish I received was agedashi tofu and it was one of those \\"gray areas between Thai and Japanese food\\"....basically they were right and I was wrong.  I've worked as a server and bartender for over two years at a Japanese restaurant. I'm very familiar with Japanese food.  I was very put off and offended that the staff would try to sell me on that garbage. I told him I didn't want it and he took it away.

My friends and I needed to shout to hear each other, which is not my idea of a relaxing meal. Having said all this, the food was certainly quite good. We shared the large antipasti, which was outstanding. The cheese, meats, greens and olives assortment was authentic, well presented and extremely tasty, and when our waitress brought this appetizer, to her credit, she immediately explained the scrumptious components therein. My entree was eggplant parm, served with a choice of pasta. I opted for the penne, which was actually even more flavorful than the well prepared eggplant dish. Others at our table enjoyed chicken parm, chicken marsala, lobster ravioli and the restaurant's Frutti Di Mare Fra Diavolo. My friends and I were all pleased with our selections.

My pork chop was much closer to raw than mid rare, and I stopped consuming it when even the darkened environment failed to cover that up. I suspect this is a consequence of the hugely thick portion.

I had been telling my wife we have to go here for a long time but seeing the lines so many times we just drove by. This time we said let's just do it. \\n\\nAfter about a 15 minute wait they come out and tell us that they only have enough biscuits for us and the rest of the people behind us would not get any. Another 5 minutes and we are at the register and ready to order that's when they tell us we are out of biscuits we miscounted. So we have to come up with something else to order. \\nI decide to go with the hash ups and my wife gets the Pine street fried club without the biscuits. \\n\\nThe people at the table next to us were just ahead of us in line and they soon each have a Reggie and they dig in. The women is not very happy as the biscuit is so hard she can hardly bite into it and because they ran out of gravy about that time and she only had a spoonful on it. Nope she is not a happy camper. \\nOur food comes out around 2:10 and it looks good. I'm thinking maybe with the last biscuits being so bad that I may have lucked out so I bite into it and the grease just rolls off of the hash browns . My wife looks at me and tells me she can't eat hers at all, way to much grease as the grits were sitting in a pool of the stuff. She picks a bit at the chicken and try's the fried green tomato and we leave. \\n\\nI don't know if they were in a hurry to close or if the biscuits would help soak up some of the grease but it was bad. We have eaten many places across the U.S. and have had some very greasy food but for me to only take a few bites and agree to leave it was just bad. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, I really wanted a biscuit sandwich with some country ham which I had been craving.

The drinks came out promptly and the appetizers shortly after. Both appetizers were warm on the outside and ice cold on the inside. The spanakopita (which was described as light and flaky) was at the warmest point, just luke warm and soggy. And the keftedes were clearly microwaved as well. We tried to cancel the entree, but it was already sent out as we searched for our waitress. The entree again was clearly reheated and bland.

I have even tried working with them on how to properly order this burger. When I confront them about making a new burger I always get some sort of attitude. The female grill cook on multiple occasions has passed by the window and glared at me. One time inside within complete earshot and sight blamed me for ordering the burger wrong. Not just her but other managers here have given me an attitude for requesting them to remake the burger I ordered correctly. The food quality is just like any other burgerville whats supposed to set them aside from other places besides their food is their service and this location is an epic fail and a disgrace.

The lemon should almost make you pucker with the pepper kicking in with that spicy punch.  Laseters reads my mind.  YUM.\\n\\nThis was after a night of beer tasting and popcorn eating, so we needed some food and wings were mentioned and I was told by a reliable source that these were the best wings.

My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday, so we were super ready to celebrate and enjoy our time. Long story short, we did.\\n\\nThe ambiance of Waypoint is very cool with an open bar and nautical look. The service was excellent - our waiter gave us fantastic recommendations on drinks and food and was just generally friendly and easy to chat with.\\n\\nIn all, we ordered Kenny's Bread Plate ($6), the ranch dusted fried clams ($17), the crispy char belly ($17), the uni bucatini ($22), and because we don't believe in limiting yourself to one dessert, the cornbread cheesecake ($9) AND the donuts ($9). \\n\\nFirst of all, who goes to an excellent and fairly pricey place for dinner and orders (read: pays actual money for) a bread plate?! I guess we do, and boy we were not sorry. This bread was the freshest, springiest bread you could imagine, served with kelp butter (um. YUMMMMM!!) and white bean puree with squid ink. I don't know what the hell else was in this white bean/squid ink puree but I could have eaten it as a whole meal. It was creamy, buttery, smooth, and had the slightest hint of ocean (and intrigue *wiggles eyebrows*) from the squid ink.\\n\\nThe ranch dusted fried clams were the perfect bite of chewy (yet, tender!) oceany clams, perfectly snacky and yet filling. The ranch dust, folks, is NOT your run-of-the-mill cool ranch dorito dust - it was absolute crack, but in a whole new way. The whole thing was served with a grilled lemon wedge, which added a nice charred touch.\\n\\nThe crispy char belly was the fattiest, freshest, and perfectly-crispiest piece of fish I'd ordered from a restaurant in a long time. It was perfectly plated with more heavenly bean puree (different beans, though), and a green salad with roasty grapes. The fish and bean puree were pure rich delciousness, but the salad balanced that out perfectly. \\n\\nThe uni bucatini, as many before me have said, was a near-perfect plate of housemade pasta. The noodles themselves were perfectly al dente, and had that signature fresh-made pasta springy feel to them. The dish was FULL of uni, and was briny, salty from the pecorino and egg yolk, and very creamy, all somehow while not weighing us down.\\n\\nAnd finally, dessert. I'm personally a huge sucker for cornbread, so the cornbread cheesecake was MY KIND OF DESSERT. Rich, creamy, crunchy (from the popcorn and candied hazel nuts), and toasty (from the generous dollop of toasted meringue on top). It was DEFINITELY very corn-forward, but was perfectly balanced with a tart berry coulis swoosh on the plate. Yummo. The cinnamon-sugar donuts were exactly what we'd expect and hope for in a fancy donut. They were light, piping hot, and extremely crispy on the outside, only accentuated by the thick dusting of cinnamon sugar. The chocolate plate-swoosh was dark and rich and delicious, sprinkled with cocoa nibs. The plate came with 3 big old donuts, so for $3 a pop (truthfully a good deal), I'd eat these before eating basically any other donuts in this city. \\n\\nOver all, we had a spectacular time at Waypoint, and will definitely be back."},{"name":"Toulouse Cafe and Bar","address":"3120 Palm Way, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So I've been to Toulouse several times and have also taken friends from France. I wanted to get a different prospective before I finalized my review. So the service is hit or miss. It can be outstanding or fair.

Though some waiters are good, he was so good its just was not the same place ( I update this on Mar 9...Frank has returned!!! All is right again in the universe). \\nThe wait staff wears the traditional white with aprons and for the most part reminds me of France, but the atmosphere is just missing something. Perhaps music and some French waiters but for the most part it's adequate. Although they are missing opportunity to elevate the  dinning experience with more authentic French experiences. \\nThe food has been good to great. I've had almost everything on the menu so I've not been disappointed. I will mention the bouillabaisse started with more scallops, shrimp and fish, with some mussels. It was exceptional the first couple of times and received a positive review from my French friends. However the last couple of times I've noticed considerable more mussels and much less of the other ingredience. For a 30 dollar dish, I want to see an honest portion of seafood not a over sampling of mussels. The crispy duck leg confit is excellent. The cheese plate, onion soup, bread, north point oysters, sole and the escargot are excellent..much better than trulucks. \\nBUT, the Souffl√©, both the chocolate and Grand Marnier are delightful. The other desserts are excellent as well. Mix the nice and stout with the chocolate souffl√© and you want be disappointed. \\nOverall this is a 3.5 to 4 star on most nights. It has the potential to be better but they are going to have to bring in some managers with a creative focus and willingness to get out there and hustle.

Unfortunately, a disastrous combination of inefficiency and misplaced priorities made my wait excruciatingly and unnecessarily long.\\n\\nWhile I waited and the line behind me grew to over 20 people, one of the employees left her post at the counter and took one phone order after another.

Asking her about her current relationship with her current beau, she says \\"It's perfect. He's not around much. He leaves me alone.\\" Asking her about her opinion on marriage, she says, \\"Never. What's the point?\\"  If I were to live again, I'd go with that motto. \\n\\nChose Clyde Common because I wanted to get my arms around the Portland dining scene and this is a must. And she endorses it.\\n\\nPopcorn. Yum. Makes you want to go back to Linden Street Brewery, a relative new comer to the Oakland dining scene, exceptionally great beer and excellent popcorn. I bet that they learned from Clyde Common.\\n\\nCheese Board. Charcuterie Board. Endive Salad. Rabbit Stew. Duck Confit. Gnocchi. Octopus.  All exceptional.\\n\\nThere are some more daring ones that I did not dare. Like the fried pata. There was no goose on the menu that evening. Bummer. \\n\\nAmbience is superb. It feels like a restaurant you'd see in New York City or Philadelphia or Boston. It has a very European / East Coast feel to it, and a bit dark and mysterious.\\n\\nI'd come back for a cocktail and pata for two now I understand it's an interpretation of Pilipino food."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"My birthday unfortunately falls just before Valentine's Day. Even though we have love this restaurant, for the last couple of years in a row we have gone just before Valentine's Day and been subjected to their version of a Valentines menu. Sorry! I don't like beef, and I don't necessarily want chocolate for dessert. I understand that what is considered normally a romantic dinner is just not my idea of a perfect meal. This time, to avoid the whole Valentines dinner problem, I booked a meal a week early. It has been a long time since I have had such a fabulous dinner experience. Frasca and Chimney Park in Windsor are my two favorite restaurants in Colorado. I had been less enthused with Frasca because I had only been eating there when I didn't really have a chance to choose from a regular menu. Last night was absolutely delicious. We asked our waiter to have our selections paired with wines. We asked for full pours instead of half glasses and we were decadent and indulged! Every course was incredible. The pairings were fabulous. We asked that if there was a choice in wines, that they would \\"bandit big\\" as our waiter offered. This was an absolutely amazing meal. Incredible service.

Fantasticly eerie. \\n\\nI had the risotto cakes entree and chocolate mint creme brulee for dessert. The risotto cakes were amazing. I'm a vegetarian and something about their seasoning seriously made me think I was eating bacon when I was eating the mushrooms. Could be a good or bad thing. I just thought it was crazy that they were able to do that. It was like an explosion of flavours. The dessert was pretty good but their use of sad little out-of-season strawberries & blueberries as garnish wasn't really a smart move, in my opinion. I'd rather them use in-season fruits and have them taste MUCH better. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had the potato gnocchi and a pie with a really long name.

Who knew!?\\n\\nI was walking by this food truck, parked today on the UT campus in front of Gregory Gym, on my way to Wendy's.  I stopped to look at the menu on the trailer, and a guy stepped out from inside the truck to start taking orders.  I decided to forego Wendy's and try something from the truck.\\n\\nIt's a very small menu:  a burger and a salad.  But this is a truck, so one can forgive the small number of selections.  I chose the burger.  It's a turkey burger with vegetables and cheese.  I asked what vegetables come on the burger and was told the veggies are in the burgers.  Knowing how ground turkey can be dry, I figured this was for moisture as well as flavor.  And boy did it add a great taste!\\n\\nThe burger is not the skimpy, flat ground turkey patty that I expect and get at most other places.  This burger was thick, juicy, and the veggies added to the meat perfectly.  They use cheese from Antonelli's, and it adds great flavor as well.  The bun is brioche, but it doesn't take away from the burger.  A lemon pepper aioli only adds to the carousel of flavors.\\n\\nThe side of \\"potato rounds\\" was not what I expected -- but that's not a bad thing.  They are essentially which potato chips, but for me they were done perfectly.  A crispy -- like a potato chip -- ring surrounding a softer middle -- like a french fry -- just nailed it.  The potatoes come with a side of creamy homemade buttermilk dill sauce.  Really good stuff.\\n\\nI hope this truck sticks around a while.

The dining area is small: around 6 two-tops indoors (some, I suppose, could do for crowded four-tops) and around 4 tables in back on the patio.  We wanted to sit outside, but there was another couple out there and, as close as the tables are together, it just would have been weird to plop down right next to them with no one else in the joint.\\n\\nService was incredibly friendly and fast.  Our server took the time to go over the menu with us and point out the specialties of the house (chicken enchiladas and spinach & mushroom enchiladas, she said).  My one serious knock on the service is that she delivered our water glasses by grasping each glass over the top with her hand, insuring that her fingers were squarely placed right where my mouth was supposed to go.  Ew.  Fortunately, there were some straws up on the left-hand side of the front counter to remedy this.\\n\\nThe complimentary chips were nothing special, but the accompanying salsa was above-average - much spicier than the usual bland stuff many places throw out to satisfy a table's most sensitive palate.  \\n\\nI found the heralded spinach and mushroom enchiladas to be just okay.  I give them points for not being drowned in grease and sauce.  There was enough cheese on top to complement the dish without making you feel like you were eating a deconstructed pizza.  But there were about as many mushrooms in those enchiladas as there are plastic babies in a king cake.  Popeye would have been pleased, but I want my share of shrooms too.\\n\\nMaybe I chose poorly on the sides, but the rice was ho-hum and the black beans had that fresh-out-of-the-can flavor.\\n\\nBy now this may sound like a 2-star review, but I give Consuelo a third star just for being BYOB.

I'm talking we're sharing our meal with each other and just reveling in every bite like it's a little slice of heaven. And the owners and staff are some of the friendliest people around, they always make everyone feel so welcome.

It was not pleasant at all.\\n\\n2 for the food, the only positive part was that the bread was warm even though we had to ask for it, every other table got it without asking. Our appetizers were ok. Then our entrees came ( I got prime rib, my gf got grouper) BOTH our entrees were cold and completely tasteless. We were compelled to send them back but we were just so over the entire time so we just ate and left.\\n\\nWe came here 2 years ago and it was awesome. I'm shocked that a restaurant that charges this much for seafood and meat can go from so good to so bad. Maybe it's a change in management or chef but either way you can get 100 times better food in downtown Boston which is a hop, skip or a jump away. I wouldn't recommend anything about this place. It has gone so downhill and I know we will never come back here. We live in Boston and are very disappointed in the way our night went here. For a $150+ meal you'd expect to at least get a warm entree and decent service. We got absolutely nothing for $150.

The menu items reminded me of penera.  Soups, sandwiches, and salads.  The thing that I loved was that they have gluten free bread, so for the first time in over two years I was able to eat a sandwich at a restaurant!  Not only did they have gluten free bread, but they went out of their way to minimize cross contamination.  They put down sandwich wrappers over the work station, and got out a new knife to make and cut our order with. This was the first restaurant that I have felt understands the importance of not cross contaminating food!  When we got our sandwiches I was very surprised with how big they were.  My daughters split the pb and j and I had a turkey bacon club.  None of us could finish our sandwiches they were so big!

The decor, tables, clientele haven't changed much, even the menus are probably exactly the same. They even didn't even bother to print new ones when there were slight alterations, they just wrote in pen. The best part for me is that they don't charge extra for meat substitutions. Some places will charge a ridiculous $2 to substitute meat for two slices of tomato. I got mushrooms as a substitute and was quite surprised to see a full plate of food for my $3. Much also to my surprise was the lack of gut rot afterwards --- it appeared that I also ate real food for that $3.  \\n\\nI quite enjoyed the regular mish mash of customers at Bon's too on Thursday morning.

I highly recommend you get your tickets when you arrive and not wait until the last minute because you cannot pick them up at Pioneer Hall (which is where this Dinner Show takes place).\\n\\nIn addition to walking to the site or going by bus, you can also take a ferry from the Contemporary Resort located next to The Magic Kingdom.  So if you're heading here after a day at MK, just hop a monorail to the Contemporary then hop the ferry to Pioneer Hall.  \\n\\nThis is the only Dinner Show at Disney we return to again and again and again.  It's also the only Dinner Show I recommend to all my personal friends from out of state as a \\"must do\\" when planning a trip to WDW.  \\n\\nGo - Let your hair down - and prepare to laugh until your sides hurt as you fill up on some amazing southern style cooking!!"},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here several times and they never dissapoint.

Everyone can find their own preferred taste when it comes to what they want to eat ranging from everyday comfort foods like pizzas, turkey legs, and hot dogs to more distinguished foods best seen at the World Showcase in EPCOT. However, what Disney World does lack in are choices for those who want gluten free baked goods. That is why Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC in Disney Springs is a saving grace per se.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC is a little place located right near the edge of the lake of Disney Springs' south side. It doesn't exactly stand out from the other eateries in the area which are named by far more popular individuals like Iron Chef Masahara Morimoto or Jimmy Buffet, the dude who eats \\"Cheeseburgers in Paradise,\\" but at least it isn't tucked away in some corner most people won't get to. Upon entering, you'll be greeted to a lot of pink. As for the selection, it is limited to two glass displays. Given that the place did not have a lot of people both times I went, I guess they do not need to cook a huge assortment of baked goods. I blame the stigma that gluten free is often associated to food not being delicious.\\n\\nWith the stigma mentioned in mind, the baked goods provided by Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC are all good and have a flavor rivaling most high-end bakeries and definitely eons ahead of the mass produced stuff you get at Dunkin' Donuts or Krispy Kreme. The price is about average for baked goods which means it is cheap compared to most food fare provided at Disney. Not only that, for gluten free baked goods, it is technically cheap too. I've eaten many gluten free baked goods before and usually the price is over $4 just for a donut. A donut of all things!\\n\\nSadly, the service both times was done by workers who seemed to be a bit pompous. You know how gluten free foods are often linked to hipsters and their entitled attitudes? Well, these two workers I had to deal with both times had that attitude going on. Besides that, everything else was a-okay.\\n\\nA tip: definitely try one of the specialty donut flavors. They are all worth decadently divulging in. :D"},{"name":"Hog Wild BBQ","address":"9226 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Stumbled upon this bbq shop near a mall.

On multiple occasions (we live in the neighborhood), they've forgotten items in the order, burnt the burgers, served cold/undercooked fries or just had really slow service. If it was a one-time deal, I wouldn't let it bother me. It's a consistent theme though. Whether we order in the restaurant or order through the app, something is bound to go wrong at this location.

This place opened on my anniversary in 2007, and back then it really WAS mighty fine!! The shakes were huge, the burgers to die for, and the staff happier than any I'd encountered in a long time. It made me not mind the exorbitant prices our family of four paid to eat a burger/shake meal. But as the years have passed, the soullessness of the creatures who run the corporation that owns MF has sucked all the greatness out of the place. The MF employees who would frequent my restaurant for lunch would be in such obvious despair about how insanely awful their job was, it made my heart break for them. One of my coworkers had a fiancee working there, and she was always on the warpath about the way he was treated as an employee. Once I started noticing the despair, I also started seeing the sharp decline in the food quality there at MF. And I have been back only a few times since, regretting it tremendously each of those times. The shakes are now downright tiny by comparison (although no cheaper)f, and the food straight up sucks. It's a real shame, because it used to be one of the greats. But I won't be wasting my hard-earned cash there again.

It was the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted in my life. I'm from California and know the basics of what to expect from a Mexican restaurant although nothing beats homemade cooking. Walking in, I realized there was no \\"Salsa Bar\\". Instead, they had this little cart where you would open it to get your stuff. I found it extremely weird considering most restaurants/taquerias have it open and much bigger. All the salsas were flavorless and absolutely disgusting. It was either too salty or just plain. The best thing out of the so called \\"Salsa Bar\\" was the cut up limes. What made it worse was that I found out that they charge for chips???!! Seriously, is this business that stingy? Usually, chips and salsa are included with your meal. You don't pay for chips. Having to pay for chips was a red flag for me. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that charged for chips. It's free refills on chips & salsa; guacamole is usually extra but that's it. Oh, the chips were also very stale and chewy. So I paid for stale, nasty chips. I don't understand how businesses can serve this to their customers. I wasn't even sure if they were actually made there or just bought. The chips came out cold so that could be a big sign that they are store-bought...\\n\\nNow, the guacamole... It was horrible! Completely watery and no seasoning whatsoever. I tried to save it by adding a ton of salt, pepper, & lemon juice but nothing worked. After adding way too much stuff, it finally tasted \\"okay\\". Huge disappointment considering guacamole is so easy to make. Sadly, you're better off going to Chipotle to get decent guacamole. To many people this place seems cheap but the prices for lots of stuff was questionable. $2.50 for a jarritos? Overpriced and not worth it. Lots of the menu items looked unappetizing and had very little for the price. I already had a bad feeling about this place when I saw the prices and appearance of the food. However, I needed to try it just to confirm. \\n\\nSo, I got a chorizo taco, carne asada, and carnitas. Chorizo wasn't even spicy and had no seasoning. Carne asada didn't even seem like it was the correct meat, it was very fatty and chunky. The carnitas was not crispy and also had no flavor. Only reason I could tell it was carnitas was because of how it looked and the one percent taste of pork. I feel bad for the people who think this place is great and worth the money. I can't even recommend anywhere to go considering I have no clue where to get good Mexican food except by actually going to Mexico or California.\\n\\nDon't believe the four star reviews if you've actually had real Mexican food. You'll be confused and irritated that money was spent at this location. Never coming here again unless Chef Gordon Ramsay comes to do a Kitchen Nightmares episode and fixes the place up. Seems like he's the only one who can save this place unless there's a whole new revamp of the menu and cooks. \\n\\n*tables were very dirty & trash can was overfilled and items were piled on top of each other (disgusting) \\n\\nP.S.

As I'm standing at the pizza shop door !! DO NOT TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS LIKE IDIOTS EAT24, that move was insulting to my intelligence and simply made you look ridiculous.

The one time that we ordered for delivery and didn't get quite the right thing, he immediately sent someone back out with the corrected item. Excellent customer service.

I figured it's about time that I express the experiences that I encounter to help others get a better feel for the food, service, and ambiance .... and the culture of its management.  \\n \\nMy wife and I tried to get into another restaurant in Buckhead but the wait was too long. As we sadly left one of our favorite go-to locations, we passed by Smokebelly BBQ and saw that the parking lot was full and decided to give it a try.\\n \\nWe found the receptionist friendly, the d√©cor and ambiance appealing, and people enjoying lively conversation.  We started with an appetizer of deviled eggs, and found them to be terrible. The white of the egg was chewy and rubber-like and the yellow yoke mixture dry with a taste of fish.  We pointed this out to a manger, Wesley, who took the remaining eggs away and said he would \\"take care of it. \\"\\n\\nI ordered the combo - ribs and beef brisket and my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Our sides included coleslaw, mac N cheese, and sweet potato souffl√©. \\nThe food presentation had little appeal to the appetite. The beef brisket was dry with a cardboard texture and the ribs lacked flavor with little bark.  The pulled pork sandwich was good, moist with some nice flavors hitting the palate. The sides were of ample size with good flavorful.  They offered a nice selection of BBQ sauces at a mini-bar centrally located in the restaurant. These would have added a nice touch to some properly prepared BBQ. \\n\\nThe server was pleasant and attentive. We like him. \\n\\nWhen we asked for the bill, we reminded our server that the deviled eggs were not to be charged. Instead of crediting the $4.50 for the devilled eggs, he presented us with a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit. \\n \\nI called the Wesley, a  manager,  over and told him that I expected the appetizer to be credited and that his offer of a coupon to revisit the restaurant was an insult.\\n \\nThe next time I pass by Smokebelly BBQ, I will keep driving. .... to Fox Bros.

You may want to schedule getting lost into your agenda. It's actually not that hard to find, but the location totally throws you off. I think someone already  mentioned it....you'll think you're in the wrong place, but you're actually not.

The road to get there is not paved.\\n\\nAnyway, the location is pretty cool. I guess a hidden coffee shop with actual plant life is even more romantic than a boring old java joint with a parking lot and some planted geraniums from Home Depot. \\n\\nCafe Mundi is small, but they make good use of what they have with nicely spaced out tables (yeah!). They have a bit of a background music/people chatting imbalance, but a friend and I both thought this could be solved by hanging a tapestry or more art on the walls to absorb some of the sound. The cafe has an extensive menu and decent prices, but I wasn't overly impressed by the food (although apparently I should have tried the waffles and the beer....nearly everyone in the place had a beer on a Sunday morning!) They do have Wednesday evening poetry readings and Monday night movies as well as many other events. Check out their website for a listing.\\n\\nI would say Cafe Mundi is much more of a social coffee house than it is a work one.

Surprisingly, my friend and I had every intention of checking out the new location that opened on Route 1 on Saugus, but decided to go to the Assembly square one instead since it was closer to downtown. This was my first time and I brought along a Groupon of which I paid $25 for $50 worth of food.\\n\\nWe arrived around 8pm and it was unsurprisingly packed for being a Saturday night. We were promptly seated and placed an order for our first round of drinks, the ronaritas. Basically it's a coronita submersed into a partially filled margarita. As you finish your marg, the beer should spill out. So then it's like you're sipping beer through a straw. For $9, I wasn't going to get a 2nd round of that. Instead we decided to go with the traditional margaritas as the price seemed to be pretty cheap. When we saw the bill later, we realized that our server had put in for the Papagayo marg rather than the mamacita margs, which was a difference of about $1.75 each. Whatever, no biggie.\\n\\nWe were given a small bowl of chips and salsa when we were seated and decided to start off with the guacamole and ceviche. Apparently other locations make the guac tableside which means you can ask them to add little more lime or spice. It was a pretty good portion for the price and had noticeable chunks of avocado. My problem was that it was severely lacking in salt and lime. I asked the server for some salt and pepper, of which she brought out a large grinding mill and salt container. Quite confused, do y'all not supply shakers usually? That confident that your food satisfies all palates? Follow suit with all the other Mexican-themed restaurants that turn the coronita bottles into the sal y pepe shakers...instant hit. Plus then I wouldn't have to have the awkwardly large salt container you use in the kitchen at my table.\\n\\nMy next issue was with the ceviche. It came with 3 fried plantain chips and was heavily doused in a tomatoey, salsa base. All the ceviche I've experienced in the past have bright citrus flavors and very refreshing. It looked, and tasted, like it was seafood bathed in mango salsa. The tuna and shrimp are honestly lost in the soup. Plus the menu says prepared table side....lies. That led me to believe that this was probably just scooped out of a large container in the kitchen right onto the plate. \\n\\nFor our mains we ordered the fish and shrimp tacos. Shrimp tacos weren't bad, I asked for some more limes to squeeze on them which gave them that extra oomph. They were fried and well seasoned. The fish tacos on the other hand, flat. We had to add extra salt, pepper, and guac to it to make it somewhat satisfying.\\n\\nOur server was very friendly, attentive, and took our Groupon no problem. Of course alcohol wasn't included in that deal and we tipped off the pre-discounted price; nonetheless for the final amount we paid I honestly didn't think it was worth it. Probably not gonna come back to this location, or any other Papagayos to be quite frank."},{"name":"Wondermade","address":"214 E 1st St","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"We got the coffee chocolate ice cream.

So on a Saturday morning, I visited with my family soon after they open at 11:30am. We were greeted warmly with a smile and they sat us quickly. Their menu is actually quite large but their lunch specials were quite a draw because of its good value. We ordered a lunch combo (salad, miso soup, rice, teriyaki chicken/beef and a choice or California, BC roll, or Yam tempura roll), a chicken udon, a tempura udon, and a yakisoba. \\n\\nThe decor at TAKE is dated, nothing to brag about. It's clean overall but the place doesn't seem like its been renovated for years - the restaurant just feels tired and old. \\n\\nThe food arrived a little slower than I would have liked, especially since we were the first table there so there was no excuse for the food coming out slow because there were numerous orders. The lunch box arrived first and the food looked good and tasted fine. The udon noodles arrived next and was a bit of a let down. The noodles seemed like the kind you would get in little packets for 50 cents each at the supermarket and the broth was fairly flavourless. The tempura was greasy and the coating was not flaky like some other places we've tried. The yakisoba arrived next sizzling. There was a lot of noodles piled high.

There is very little service, and it doesn't \\"look\\" warm and accommodating.  So, that's what keeps it from getting a fifth star.  That's perfect, however, because if this place had full service and were big and pretty, it would be packed to the gills all the time.

Just the right amount of the sides, and the salsa has a nice bite to go perfectly with the eggs and a wonderful handmade tortilla.  It's so ridiculous to me, by the way, how many places have handmade flour tortillas but the corn and wheat ones are floppy store-bought junk.  La Cocina de Consuelo does it right, which should be expected at all Mexican and Tex-Mex places, since corn tortillas are so easy to make properly!  My honey had the migas, and I wish I could say they were great, but she wolfed them down so fast (this is very unusual for her) that we didn't get to trade bites like we normally do.  So, I'll trust her judgement that they were \\"delicious\\".  The salsa is fantastic.  It's not too hot, but they aren't afraid to give it the kick that most places fear will burn their poor customers' widdle gringo tongues.  Authentic and yummy!

I tried a little of everything but I just could not develop a taste for the liver pate.

Out of the seven of us (all ordering different items) only one person (myself) didnt have to change their order due to lacking ingredients.  Whether it was prime rib, chicken, lobster, cod, side dishes, mint for mojitos, or the alcohol itself our options were limited to about 20% of the menu.  The birthday girl ordered another drink from the menu at full price... again, it arrived half full.  We later found out from the server that they were running low on alcohol... which would account for the diluted half full glasses.\\n\\nThe food: It was alright.  I really really enjoyed the cornbread(which was free! Go figure!). I ordered the filet medallion trio with blue cheese crust, parmesan then crab crust.  The blue cheese was my favorite followed by the crab.  I didnt care for the parmesan. I ordered it medium and it arrived medium rare.  My Other's steak was OK.

It was pretty busy, but our timing was good and we managed to get what I consider to be prime seats in this place; the upper area where there are 4 tables. We managed to get one right by the window in the corner, which just happens to be my favourite spot. Already off to a good start!\\n\\nOur server was quick to bring menus and water, and was friendly. She gave us time to have a look and order some drinks. I ordered a glass of Prosecco ($8), which was quite nice. My boyfriend ordered a beer, for around $6ish I think,  which he quite liked..Farmhand Ale  I think? \\n\\nI had quite a time deciding what I wanted as there were 3 or 4 things I would have happily tried, but finally decided on the pork tenderloin ($24) which came with an au jus (can't recall what was in it at the moment)  a snap (I think) pea risotto, and  whole baby carrots and asparagus. I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Blasted Church ($8), which was fine, but don't know if I'd order again. Glad I tried it though as I've been wanting to, and since I'm not a huge white wine drinker (excluding Prosecco and Champagne), I was happy  I could try just one glass. The tenderloin was done just right, and the vegetables were perfect. The flavour of the risotto was  good, but I think the consistency was just slightly off the mark.. a bit \\"claggy\\" ..or too solid  in consistency. Risotto can be a  tricky thing, and I'm of the mind that if it can't be done perfectly, it's probably best to not do it at all; at least at a restaurant. I'd have not been too thrilled if that was the main part of my entree.  My boyfriend had the lamb, and  he said it was very good. Didn't try it as lamb isn't something I'm too down with.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a decent dining experience, with good service. I think the next time I come back, I'd like to come for drinks and a few snacks rather than dinner. I'm not sure it's all the time, or whether this was a temporary thing, but at the bottom of the menu it noted that after 10 pm, various types of booze were on special - beer, highballs etc. I'd double check that before hand it that's your reason for going, but I think that's definitely something I can get on board with!"},{"name":"Queen of Sheba","address":"2413 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We saw the line at Ox and Toro Bravo, laughed at the Portlandia intelligentsia who was passive-aggressively making their discomfort known by White People Sighs and went to Queen of Sheba who welcomed us with open arms and served us a wonderful meal within minutes.

Friends spoke highly of it, the decor is so posh, and the name makes you want to tuck into a good book while sipping hot chocolate. Unfortunately, the crowds of people and lackluster food make it an unpleasant cafe.\\n\\nLAYOUT: When you enter, you immediately enter the ordering line. Because of the tilt of the menu, it is actually difficult to read the menu while in line (genius design right there), so when you finally make it up to the counter, you must scan the menu quickly otherwise you will delay the 15+ people waiting behind you. After ordering, you have two choices: either fight the packs for a seat somewhere or loiter awkwardly near the food and beverage area waiting for your order. \\n\\nThere are two floors of seating, but I would wager the entire establishment can seat maybe 30 people crammed together at any given time.\\n\\nFOOD: Limited food options make me wonder how anyone manages to eat here as a meal. For breakfast, you have a choice of a few types of breakfast sandwiches--all of which are very straightforward like eggs on a bagel--or the many delicious looking pastries that end up tasting just a little dry. \\n\\nFor lunch or afternoon snack, the sandwiches have a strange combination of ingredients that have not worked well for me in the past. The turkey sandwich is somewhat bearable, but the abundance of lunch options in Harvard Square means you do not have to bear with Crema unless you are a glutton for long lines and mediocre food.\\n\\nThe hot chocolate is adequate but nothing special. Starbucks has better mediocre hot chocolate, but Burdicks down the road beats everyone in that department. Can't speak about the coffee though\\n\\nWAIT: The line is long. Always. Fortunately it moves fast, but that just means that the beverage and food wait is long as well. From my 5-10 encounters here, the baristas and other staff members have never seemed like they are in any kind of hurry, which seems so incongruous with the crowd of patrons surrounding them.\\n\\nSEATING: Seating is hard to come by. In order to find a table, you and your companion must loiter awkwardly near a table or make rounds through the crowded seating area downstairs and upstairs. Because it is a cafe, there are also those patrons who have parked themselves there indefinitely, which is unfortunate.\\n\\nOVERALL: Not a huge fan. I struggle to understand why anyone enjoys this place except for a mass delusion. Food is average and limited, and seating is a nightmare.

Make your reservations for both lunch and dinner.  And pre-order your lunch.  I was able to do this logging in on our computer, but NOT on my App.  I had breakfast reservations, but decided to cancel when I got lunch reservations.  I knew I wanted to order the quiche as a vacation treat and it is literally twice as much at breakfast according to the online menu.  Our small party of 3 was able to get reservations for lunch and dinner.  We were at Magic Kingdom for two days and I would have liked to split these up, as I was wondering if it would be too much to eat both our meals there in one day.  I am really glad I kept our reservations!!!!  Lunch and Dinner are so different, plus at dinner you get to see the Beast, plus you get WINE!!  You get Wine!  Yay, you get Wine at Disney!  Husband and I both ordered the fish and it was excellent.  Our daughter enjoyed her kids meals as well:  Pork, green beans, mashed potatoes and shrimp for dinner.    Husband liked the quinoa salad, but definitely needed to add the french onion soup as this is a really light meal.  I would advise against the gray stuff.  Everybody loves to recommend it just so they can say the famous line, but it's really a waste of your calories when you could get a Cheesecake cupcake or something like ice cream on Main Street.  When you compare pricing to something like Tony's, this is a WAAAAY better deal.  I also recommend the Skipper Navigation restaurant as a delicious way to avoid eating a soggy burger at that Cosmic restaurant because you are caught with no reservations(our last trip a few years ago).  I'll admit, I'm a snob when it comes to food and not having reservations (as in deciding at the last minute and waiting in a long line when you are starving) stresses me out and makes everyone miserable.  I'll also add that we were there two days before Thanksgiving which is supposed to be a busy week and yes for both lunch and dinner there was plenty of space inside the castle and yet no reservations available.

The mix of fresh and imported products allows for a wide spectrum of experimentation, and the frugal nature of much Polish cooking keeps prices reasonable and room for exploration high. The sausages are terrific, although it's best to read up on the differences between them before you go-- my Polish is severely limited, and I think perhaps even if it were better, the (sometimes really, really attractive) deli girls don't know the subtle differences between the kielbasa variations.\\n\\nRegardless, I would concentrate on the deli counter and frozen prepared foods above all else, then the breads, then the imported products. I am not wild about their desserts, because they are made in a somewhat rustic, not-very-sweet Polish style. They are authentic, but could still use some improvement. \\n\\nOne item in particular to enjoy is their boudin blanc, aka ask for the \\"veal hot dogs.\\" Absolutely unreal deliciousness in natural casings. Now they even carry some beer from the region: check out the Zywiec (pronounced zhiv-yets) and Okocim (oh-koh-cheem) rather than the Tyr or other inferior brands.\\n\\nAll in all, a great experience, and mere minutes from the Andrew Sq T stop."},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"110-532 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The beef roll and noodles were incredible.

Both were amazing. The aloo tikki tasted like a little fried piece of heaven, perfectly crispy and full of flavor. Definitely my new favorite. The kadhai chicken made a weird first impression because it comes in an oily broth but once I tasted it any hint of oil was gone. It has a clean spicy taste that's super aromatic and refreshing.

The ceviche, while different from the typical preparation, was just okay. I really enjoyed the fish tacos which had a great crispy exterior, contrasting the jicama slaw that it was served with. The mole lamb tacos were really heavy and dense, but packed full of flavour. \\n\\nWhile the food was decent, and even though they did warn us about only bringing out one dish at a time, that kind of annoyed me.

The only reason i am writing this is because i want to let everyone know that mangia makes a deep-dish pizza that could have been made in a bathtub... and that bathtub pizza is pretty spectacular. However, the aforementioned \\"tubzza,\\" unfortunately, is expensive. I recall wondering where the dvd player or tennis bracelet they owed me might be hidden within the inner layers of my bowl of pizza."},{"name":"Hoggy's Restaurant and Catering","address":"830 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband was taking me out to dinner for my belated birthday celebration.  I turned down Tucci's and Marcella's because I was tired and wanted a casual place.  We hadn't been to Hoggy's since they closed their beautiful location on Sawmill Road.  I had gotten ribs there and fell in love.  Man, what a disappointment going to Hoggy's after all this time!  Sometimes our memory plays tricks on us and we remember a place as better than it actually was.  Management said the ribs were the same, but they sure didn't seem so to me.  The sauce is orange-y and I remember it being red.  The ribs were fine, just fine.  The star for me was the huge, perfectly crunchy onion rings with dip.  I could have eaten those alone.  My husband's mac and cheese was good as well.  What was NOT good was the coleslaw.  No seasoning and it tastes like it is only cabbage and mayonnaise.  Not good at all.  So the dinner was just okay and I kicked myself that I could have had Tucci's braised short ribs with a slice of silk pie!  Back to Hoggy's...  and here's the kicker.  It was Tuesday night, about 6:15PM.  There were customers, but not all that many.  I was confused if they had table service or if you had to order at the takeout desk first and that was, in fact, the case, but no signage that I could see to direct you and no one to greet and guide you by saying \\"take a seat\\" or \\"order at the counter.\\"  When we figured out that we had to place an order first before being seated, the very sweet guy at the counter didn't quite understand what I was trying to do.  He seemed to be rattled if his questions were met with an answer he didn't expect.  Like, he asked if the sauce should go on top or on the side and I answered on the top but could I pay extra and get some on the side as well?  It really threw him.  Looking at the pricing board, it appeared that everything was ala carte, but on the receipt the sides had zero as the price although at the end, everything came out fine.  We were overcharged only five cents, so nbd.  The worst part is that the wait was very long and no one ever came to bus our booth.  It's disgusting enough to finish ribs and look at your own carnage, but when it is the mess of a bunch of folks before you, it's even worse.  Finally, after about 30 minutes, we couldn't handle it any longer and moved all the soiled napkins, bones, plates, etc. to a nearby empty table.  We still needed the table wiped as it was nasty with spilled sauce, etc.  It had been the only booth available when we got there, and we really thought someone would come clear it.  Finally, I signaled the guy who took our order and asked him if someone could wipe it down and he came back and did it.  We waited so long for our food that I got a headache, and it was made worse because the end booth had what I assume is one of the employees' little kids.  They went untended all night.  They were loudly pounding the table with something relentlessly.  No one came over to ask them to stop and behave, and it went on the whole time we were there.  As you can tell, we are never going back there again."},{"name":"W. Restaurant + Bar","address":"117 West Pender Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was incredible.

Don't get me wrong. I'll take the Pepsi challenge against the best that Dallas, Houston and even Austin has to offer. With that said, I found it odd and even more so, surprising that Austin's Porfirio's Tacos knocked my taste buds out of the park.\\n\\nThis little place is on the Eastside of Austin in an area that most people would not want to be caught after midnight. However, I have found that it is in these neighborhoods that something magical occurs when the taco fairies impart their secrets into the mind of many aspiring taco artists.\\n\\nHere is the breakdown:\\n\\nBean, bacon and cheese taco: thick cut bacon chopped up into chunks and lightly stirred into refried beans then covered with cheddar cheese. The awesomeness level of this taco was so high, I swear it could solve world hunger. Try one and prove me wrong.\\n\\nCarne Guisada: You got carne and you got guisada. Put them together and this spicy meat and gravy was delicious. The meat was fork tender and had just the right amount of spices you would expect a good guisada to have. Add some cheese to this bad boy and you'll scare a few Longhorn co-eds with your grito.\\n\\nBarbacoa: tender, moist and with a good flavor. This taco can hold its own with most of the San Antonio barbacoa joints.\\n\\nChicharron and bean taco: This combination was something my taco imagination had never conjured, but it went very well and surprised me. Chicharron's had a crispiness even after simmering in their salsa.\\n\\nSpeaking of salsa. Porfirio's doesn't mess around with their hot stuff. These are simply jalapenos and maybe a serrano or two blended up and served just like that. It will definitely put hair on a man's chest.\\n\\nPorfirio's tortillas were homemade and great tasting. If you haven't figured it out by now, this place earned a special place in my taco shaped heart. It had to be something special to break through my San Antonio taco snobbiness."},{"name":"Bundy's Bagels","address":"1421 SE 33rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"They have really fresh and delicious bagels I love their sesame seed\\nWith cream\\nCheese combo"},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Calling all New Mexican expatriates!\\n\\nIf you're looking for for New Mexican food (and New Mexican green chile), sorry this isn't the place.

The servers would walk around with a certain type of meat and would ask if you would like to have them served, and you can ask for more portions if you prefer a certain type of meat.

But I've had those things often, along with cocktails, which are fantastic. Recently, it has become my go-to place for after-work drinks with  2-3 friends (versus happy hour, which requires someplace with more space in the bar area). \\n\\nThe cocktails at Fino are exquisite, and the bartender is patient and interesting. One evening last month we sat at the bar, and he gave the rundown on his selections, his favorites, his sources, and up-and-coming things to look for, because the menu changes every once in a while. They usually have several vintage/classic cocktails -- my current favorite is the pisco sour. For a novelty drink, may I recommend the Breakfast of Champions? It's brunch in a glass, with bacon-infused bourbon and maple syrup. \\n\\nLast night, we went in for drinks and snacks, and because the bar was full, they graciously sat us in the dining room. I asked whether the waitstaff would be all right with that, and we were assured that it would not be a problem -- and it wasn't. I am certain that if I had been our waitperson, I would have been a lot more cranky with our table of four that ordered 3 items off the happy hour menu and paid with four different credit cards. She even came and let us know that happy hour was almost over if we wanted to order another round (and we did). \\n\\nIt is, after all, a restaurant, and the food (like I said, the tapas) is really good. The chef puts together some wonderful combinations. I love their cheese plate, and the flatbread and crostini are flavorful and crispy. The calamari is really tender and crispy, but the sauce is a bit reminiscent of chili-dog chili -- but the calamari is good enough on its own. The fried olives are HEAVENLY; don't let the anchovy scare you off. It serves to keep the olives moist, but they aren't the least bit fishy.  \\n\\nI plan to go back and work my way through the tapas and cocktail menus, and you should too!"},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Really yummy authentic Mexican food (or as authentic as it gets in Boston).

The atmosphere is dingy and dark but very comfortable. Prices are cheaper than any other Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, which is nice considering the high quality my burrito was. Don't know when, but I definitely see myself coming back here. There are too many things I feel I still need to try.\\n\\nOne complaint though is that the woman working gave us our food and just told us to pay later, which was strange, but then later when we finished there was a big line so we had to wait to pay to leave.

The food is sooooo delicious that it overcomes any of the possible negatives. This is the only Indian place in Atlanta I am aware of where you can distinctly savor each of the spices in your dish. Most places overdo it or something because you end up getting a jumbled mess of flavor. In Zyka, the sauces/curries are flawless. Also their butter naan is so good that we usually order 4 extra orders to take home with us to enjoy later. Also, as another poster mentioned, their mango lassi is excellent.\\n\\nThe place is a bit run down, the service is order-at-the-counter, and the food is served on (eco-friendly) styrofoam plates with plastic utensils, and sometimes their are sharply cut bones that you have to look out for in the mutton dishes....BUT the taste of the food EASILY overcomes any of these issues to the extent that the only thing going through your mind is \\"OMG how can food be this delicious?...ooh, is that fennel?

That's pretty cute....a pun off the word 'tako' (octopus). But wait...its...actually a legit beef taco. Why is there a Mexican option in a Japanese restaurant? I don't really care, but now I wanted to order it. But sadly, they didn't offer it that day (or maybe they stopped making them?). So now, this place has thrown off my sushi/taco eating mood. Now I'm just upset. \\n\\nI ordered some salmon sashimi, a pork belly don (comes with miso soup), and a lobster roll. \\n\\nSashimi - good standard raw fish. Nothing bad, just decent and acceptable. \\n\\nMiso soup - dark and cloudy with some green onions. Nothing different here, just solid miso soup. \\n\\nThe pork don - has a spicy sauce (I think it's sirracha), thinly sliced seared pork belly, oshinko, edamame and potato salad in the bowl. The pork was delicious. It was a little crispy and had light sweetness to it. The edamame was a nice touch. The oshinko offered some variation with every bite. The spicy sauce gave the bowl of rice more depth and kick. And the potato salad.....was a potato salad. Why is it in there?  I dont really get it. Maybe it's not potato salad, but it sure did taste like potato salad. Someone verify this for me....I'm pretty sure its potato salad. I think maybe you should mix everything around - maybe that helps. Overall, it was an acceptable dish. \\n\\nThe lobster roll - it was tempura battered lobster with avacado and asparagus. There wasn't a lot of lobster. But, I get it, its kind of a pricey thing to offer at $10 for the roll. The rice was a little dry....\\n I'd never order it again, but the other rolls looked really good. \\n\\nBy the end, I want to give this place 2 stars. But I'll stick with 3. They seemingly want to be a little different but they felt more like anomalies than anything else. The beef taco would have been nice to try. It would have been nice to see how they execute a 'Japanese style' beef taco. \\n\\n I want to think that having potato salad in my pork rice dish was to make me challenge what conventional Japanese cuisine could be. Or maybe how I should rethink what a potato and bacon dish could be. Or just how a potato and pork interact on the palate.

We started with Chili Con Queso which was basically melted cheese and little if any \\"chili\\" that was very bland and poorly seasoned with the salsa having more flavor.  We decided on Tacos De Pollo and Tacos De Picadillo to trade and sample each.  The Tacos De Pollo had good flavor.  The Tacos De Picadillo were extremely greasy and lacking of flavor - only two out of the three tacos were edible as the third was saturated in grease. I brought this to the attention of our server and she offered to bring a replacement -  to be safe I ordered another Tacos De Pollo.  Both tacos were to have Queso Fesco and was confirmed by our server as being omitted.  I believe they need to take a serious look at the kitchen staff and do a better job and more thorough training.

It was my first time in the city, a place I had been curious about for a while. We stayed at the hipsterific Ace Hotel and had a good experience there, we delighted in Mocha bliss each morning at Stumptown Coffee, however our dinner at Clyde Common was one of the most \\"challenging\\" culinary experiences either one of us could recall in quite a long time. \\n\\nA week before our arrival we made reservations for a party of 10 at 7pm. Given that Clyde Common is one of the most popular spots in town we thought we were in for something special. Wrong. Things started to go down hill even before our gathering started when we were told that the restaurant could not accommodate 2 more people in our party even though we called two hours prior to add them. Given that the place has communal seating (and was not at all crowded) we couldn't figure out the reason for the restriction and ended up having to un-invite a couple of friends as a result. Our server, a tall, skinny, tattooed guy taken right out of the hipster how-to handbook was clearly frustrated with the fact that he had been given a large group to wait on. Not only did he not know what a Fum√© Blanc was (\\"I can bring you Absinthe\\" was his alternative suggestion) but when asked by another friend about a choice of wine he replied in exasperation \\"Y'know, I'm very busy, I really don't have time to chit chat about the wine list\\". We were shocked. If it were solely up to me the dinner would have been immediately cancelled but we plowed through it hoping the food would make up for the lack of service. Wrong again.\\n\\nEach of the entrees I tasted was bland, flavorless, and in desperate need of salt (Bucatini, pork tenderloin, and rabbit). One friend never received her entr√©e at all which at that point amused us greatly since everything about the meal had been such a disaster. The spinach salad and locally produced wine (and lots of it) were the only redeeming factors of the whole evening. When the bill finally came we couldn't possibly pay the 18% gratuity tacked onto the several hundred dollar bill. After a tense discussion with management and complimentary desserts for the table my boyfriend and I left at least knowing that we wouldn't have to return there ever again."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Awesome new spot!

First on the agenda: \\n\\nI have a new found love of the biscuit as culinary endpoint since my experiences at Biscuit Bitch in Seattle and alongside the quality biscuit produced within the bakery of Save on Meats where I find gainful employment. Such as it is I felt it necessary to experience PDX's take on the humble yet never subtle Southern delight that is the biscuit.\\n\\nOffered in such heart-rending cardiac arresting concoctions such as: The Reggie - Featuring Fried chicken, bacon & cheese topped with gravy which in deluxe form comes with a fried egg.  The BBQ Biscuit -  with Podnah's pulled pork, Carolina style bbq sauce and topped with slaw. Or, perhaps more to your liking, the simplicity of The Chatfield - Fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with apple butter. These are merely three delectable delicacies that lie in wait to clog arteries and fatten midriffs. I decided on The Reggie as it seemed a tried and true classic take on fried chicken.\\n\\nThis dish came packaged to go in a biodegradable recycled paper box that I was sure was going to melt under the weight and liquidity of the gravy that was oozing forth from within. I opened it up to find a monstrous tower of biscuit and chicken glaring out at me and daring me to attempt to stuff it's wondrous contents down my gullet. Dare accepted I picked it up... The put it back down and like the sensible human being I sometimes can be, pulled out a set of utensils and got to the task of eating. Oh, and the eating was good. Peppery hot southern sausage gravy smothered a tender juicy chicken cutlet crispy with batter and deliciousness. The biscuit had a crunchy exterior that immediately gave way to cakey flaky divine awesome. Sorry Biscuit Bitch. You just got beat.\\n\\nDon't try to eat in cause it's freaking tiny. Eat on the street in the sun with plenty of napkins and wallow in the glory that is Pine State Biscuits.

I came here for a post-holiday brunch with a small group of friends. The Locus was previously recommended by a friend a few months back, but when we showed up on a holiday we discovered out they were closed. I like that the Locus takes reservations, which, which given the popularity of brunch in Vancouver, can sometimes be hard to find. The restaurant is situated right on Main Street. Metered street parking is available if you can find it, but I would recommend looking a block or so behind Main in the residential areas, where its free.\\n\\nThe restaurant wasn't terribly busy which was slightly surprising, but then again this was during the week after Christmas so I can't say for sure whether the holidays were a factor. I love me some eggs benny, so I ordered the crab and prawn cake, which came with tomato and spinach. This is a great option if you're looking for a lower carb option, as the plate did not come with the traditional English muffin, but literally just on top of a small bed of spinach and tomato. I think ultimately in the end I would have prefered an absorbent, bread-y vessel to soak up my hollandaise sauce, but it was still a good meal. I thought the brunch/lunch menu had a very good range of food items, ranging from your traditional breakfast items (eggs, sausage, ham) to sandwiches, bennies, burgers, waffles, and tex-mex dishes. I prefer savory brunch menu items as opposed to the sweeter variety of pancakes and waffles, so this was a plus for me. Service was relaxed and friendly.

It's early (6:45 a.m. to be exact) as myself; along with two friends (Matt and Inga) leave the house en route to the mountain for a day of skiing and snowboarding. It is the snow activity ahead that conjures up a mom-like voice in all our brains nagging things like \\"Eat a good breakfast\\", \\"You need some fuel for your fire\\" and \\"You better eat now, because we are not stopping this car just for you...selfish brat.\\" Once the voices subsided, Inga suggested Pine State Biscuits. It was close and apparently the egg, sausage and biscuit breakfast sandwiches... \\"Were to die for.\\" Little did I know she meant that in a literal way because one could have easily starved to death during the wait time.\\n\\nNow before you get your panties in a bunch (I know Portland loves their Pine State Biscuits) I am not here to bash the food. I tasted the above-mentioned egg, sausage and biscuit breakfast sandwich and it was, indeed, tasty. The biscuit was warm, flaky and perfectly baked. One could definitely eat just the biscuit and be immensely satisfied. I also tried the bacon...it too was perfectly cooked. What I am here to (for lack of a better word) bash...is the service.\\n\\nPine State Biscuits opens at 7a.m. They have the word \\"Biscuits\\" in the their name. One would assume that they would actually have biscuits ready to go at...what time?...that's right...7a.m. But sadly, this was not the case. \\n\\nNow usually Pine State Biscuits is packed with a line going down the block. Today, it was not. Along with myself, Matt and Inga, there were 8 patrons. No one had any food, yet all had ordered. Why no food you ask? Aside from an apparent lack of time management skills going on in the kitchen (I could smell biscuits cooking, it just seems they misjudged the bake time with the opening time) the main problem was the person fulfilling the orders. He had a system of...how should I put this...a system of crap. He seemed to be having issues putting together multiple orders (a process which most eateries use to get the food out in a timely manner) and instead, worked on orders one slip at a time...in the order they were written down. Let's just say multi-tasking was not his strong point. Not that he didn't have a strong point...he did. His strong point was getting confused and flustered over the mounting orders, doing pretty much nothing, yet still managing to look super busy. It was somewhat entertaining to see how many times he would wipe down a counter, look over the order slips and adjust his Gilligan-style cap. I counted 13 times within a 10-minute period. Seriously.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion of this review...Pine State Biscuits has yummy, feel good food, but if you are in a hurry to get to the mountain for a day of skiing and snowboarding...fuel up at home and maybe stop in later for an apr√®s mountain meal.\\n\\n\\nRESTAURANT LOCATION \\n3640 SE Belmont Street\\nPortland, OR 97214\\n(503) 236-3346\\nOpen 7 days a week, 7am - 2pm\\n\\nAT THE SATURDAY FARMER'S MARKET \\nPortland Farmer's Market Website"},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"700 Maguire Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"I went March of this year on a Friday night and while it wasn't busy (about 5 other groups), there was only one waitress (Cathy) for the whole floor.

Normally the meat falls off the bone with the ribs but if it's been sitting a while it can be a little tougher. I like their guac a lot, though I think it varies sometimes depending on whose made it.

The preparation was supposed to be tempura style, but it looked like 2 different batters were used to prepare the fish/carrots/broccoli/onions/green beans. I got a lot of the fried batter pieces in the container, with a lot of fried and uncoated veggies and It was too salty and greassssy!

This, however, was my first time at Sunday brunch.  We sat outside and the breeze was quite pleasant, despite being in the Texas summer.  Our server from the start was rushing.  He did not even stay at the table long enough for me to finish my question, I had to call him back.  We ordered an appetizer of \\"made to order doughnuts\\".  They arrived within 2 minutes of putting the order in.  I am certain that that meant that they were not made to order.  The serving size of three doughnuts the size of a doughnut hole was sad.  Not even before we had the chance to take our second bite, did our entrees arrive.  My friend enjoyed his Eggs Benedict.  I ordered the Tortilla Espanola.  While my tortilla was pretty good, the tomato salad that accompanied it was pathetic.  First of all, it was refrigerator cold.  Tomatoes should never be placed into the fridge, otherwise the taste of the tomato is ruined.  I am certain that the chef at Fino knew this, but needed to preserve the salad seeing as it was made before the day that I ordered it.  The bland salad completely ruined the meal.  Before I could even take my last bite, my plate was taken away and our bill was brought.  Total time at the restaurant before our bill was brought?  20 minutes.  Number of refills I received without having to ask? 0.  Like I said before, my experiences with Fino at lunch and dinner have been absolutely wonderful.  Sunday brunch was beyond disappointing.

Food was excellent but service was the worst I have ever had in Vancouver or in recent memory. We were seated on the patio. My wife and I each ordered a glass of wine, an appetizer, and a main. Our appetizers came out but no drinks. We reminded our server that we ordered wine but we never received it and eventually gave up and waited for some food to come out. When our mains came out they did not bring me a spoon so I sat there and watched while my wife ate her soup and mine went cold. Eventually, I flagged down our server again and reminded him that I would like a spoon for my soup. He asked if we wanted hot sauce at this point, which would also be appreciated, but the spoon was the priority. I reminded them again about the spoon when they only brought out the hot sauce. Eventually I gave up on the spoon or the wine and just started slurping my soup from the bowl. My wife was pretty much done her soup by this time so I borrowed hers to finish off my soup. Once we finished we sat there trying to flag down the server to get the bill as it had already been a very long dinner at this point. Eventually, after getting tired of waiting I got up and went up to the bar to pay. I asked the servers if they share the tips. The other servers are usually good so I felt badly to not tip at all. Obviously if the tip had been going to him it would have been $0 but I gave 15% because I felt bad for the other servers. Will not be going back.

So, if you factor that in, this was a pretty average experience for Bob Evans.  Granted, it was busy the last time that we went, but only because they weren't utilizing all of their tables.  News Flash:  it's a service industry.  Servers should be expected to handle more than two tables at once, and if they can't, give them some kind of technology to do so.  We went in here for breakfast, and we just weren't impressed at all.  We ordered hot chocolates with our meals and my wife specifically requested no whip cream (she hates it), and what do they give her?  Whipped cream.  The next few mugs, they didn't even fill all the way, including mine, which I did get whipped cream in.  Everything was flavorless, and don't even get me started about their sausage gravy!  That has got to be one of the worst tasting items on the planet!  Then, when we do get past our cold food, slow service, and poor quality, and make our way to the counter to pay, we find a manager who not only wasn't dressed professionally (button up, and wear a tank top under your sheer work shirt), but then instructs us that we have to run the debit card as a credit and press some weird combo of buttons to do so.

My husband and I had the French dip and it was pretty good. Nothing spectacular with the food just pretty average.

We walked in and there were no signs indicating seating. (Ie. Seat yourself, wait to be seated, or make a mad scramble for a spot if you'd like to sit comfortably.) So, while the four of us looked around for a little direction, the single person behind us snagged the last table. She was a peach. So, the four of us (two of whom were men over 6'3\\") headed for last remaining seating- a coffee table with cozy family room type seating. This is lovely for drinks, but for dinner it is sub par. So, I kept my eyes peeled for a real table to open up. Spotted one, ran over, asked the waitress if the people had left, to which her reply was, \\"I have no idea.\\"  Really?! I'm sorry, but what a bitch. She was not interested in helping us in the least. She offered no suggestions, and no help into finding out. She is primarily the reason for the low rating along with the fact that you have to know the rules ahead of the game to score seating. Turns out the table was vacant (or so I presumed with no help from staff), but there were only three chairs. Not an extra chair in the entire place. And god knows the waitress wasn't going to look for one. Returned to the cozy seating and after waiting around for some time we realized we had to order at the bar (god forbid the waitress tell us anything) and so began the dance. Limited menu, reasonably priced food, but they were out of everything. However, it wasn't as though we ordered and they said \\"we're out of that\\", it was more of a coming back around 15 minutes later to say, yeah we're out. So, after the third time we all just went, \\"Well, what DO you have?\\" We wound up with grilled cheese and tomato soup, which was very good. It's just that it was the third or fourth choice. The bartenders were much more friendly and helpful than the waitress, I'll say that. I don't think I'll return to this place. We mostly chose it bc of proximity to the show.

I would only recommend going here if you have no other options for ayce.\\n\\nIn recent years my go-to at any ayce sushi place is salmon nigiri/sashimi and oyster motoyaki because I just eat at least 20 of each. While the food here was standard ayce quality - I also tried other items like an assortment of chicken and seafood motoyaki - the service was subpar.\\n\\nThe chicken items were very flavorful and the deep fried Gouda was addicting - this is the only place I've had the latter at. The spicy sauce they used on the salmon sashimi was not at all spicy, however, it had a nice taste and next time I would ask for lots of it on the side. I really like the oyster/seafood motoyaki here - the first time they brought us oyster it was served on the shells, however, every order after that was presented in smaller cupcake-like containers. The motoyaki sauce is very delicious. For dessert, Richmond Sushi's mango pudding tastes better than BC's. \\n\\n When I ate here, the restaurant was not busy - probably no more than 30% capacity. They do the standard ayce practice here where if you order over x amount of something they'll bring you significantly less - for example, we asked for 16 oyster motoyaki and brought us 10. \\n\\nThe worst part of my dinner was it took them ~45mins to give us our nigiri, which was only 10 pieces of salmon and 15 pieces of tuna. I was confused because it was not busy and they gave us our sashimi promptly. When we tried to follow-up on our order, we were ignored once and the second time very curtly told that it was coming. My problem with this is they could have at least told us it was going to take a while. We ordered another 10 salmon nigiri and it came within a few minutes. \\n\\nWhen service is poor I automatically remove 1-2 stars depending on if other elements like the food can balance that negativity. I am used to prompt, efficient, often-times-cold service that has become normalized in many ayce Japanese restaurants, however, the service I received at BC Sushi was below my threshold. If the service was better or at least neutral, then I would have given an extra star.\\n\\nOther alternatives like Shabusen and Kyo are significantly better, especially in food quality.

(That sounds horrible, but, alas, the truth).\\n\\nThe dining area was large inside, with a few patrons scattered at the bar and some families crowded around circle tables on the main floor. There was a stage area that wasn't in use on the inside, but the sounds from the rocking cajun band on the patio definitely filtered in and was actually a positive influence on the ambiance of the place. \\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of cajun food, so I was trying to branch out. I ended up getting some chicken/rice spicy meal and it was okay. Nothing to write home about. The person I was with highly recommended the blackened catfish.

The house-made veggie burger was very good... filled with good veggies and nicely cooked. The Wurst Reuben was just OK. The grilled bratwurst patty was dry, dry. The side of onion strings had good flavor but they were limp, not crisp. On a good note, Barley's gets the beer right. We tried several of their offerings and each was very good.

If you just want a sandwich you can get something good for about $8. If you want an entree, expect to pay $15 or more, and I would have to say I have yet to have an entree that was worth $15 there. For a brewpub they come off a bit pretentious. Go for the beer, but don't expect cheap eats or fine dining experience.

The wait was about 10 minutes for two. I ordered seafood fried dragged noodle. Noodles were done perfectly, although the seafood portion was very small. The famous beef roll that won an award came out. Slight disappointment. Not enough flavour and too dry. Next chilly eggplant arrived, but it was too greasy. Way more oil in the dish than any other Chinese or Thai restaurant I've been too. Grease masked the taste of eggplant too much, and there was shredded pork in it even though the item was in the 'vegetarian' section of the menu. If I was a vegetarian I would have been upset. Lastly, the thousand chilly chicken was a surprise. So many little red dried chillies! I tried eating one, but had to spit it out. Apparently I'm not supposed to eat the chilly, but then why are they filling half the dish? My partner commented maybe that's the whole point - thousand chillies. The dish also had cracked pepper corn in it, which made my tongue almost numb. The long beans were tasteless despite all that spice. The chicken was dry and uninteresting. Is this the true Szechuan style?? I normally don't return dishes, but this one I had to. I asked the waiter and he offered to redo the dish...OK. But when the dish came back, the only difference was that it was a bit more salty. I told the waiter once again that I'm not happy with it and asked to switch to something else. He offered Kung Pao chicken. OK I said. While the Kung Pao chicken was more edible, I was still not impressed. It looked like they rushed the food: pieces of uncooked garlic and bell peppers; onions weren't even chopped up properly, and once again the lack of flavour was disappointing. However, I appreciate the waiter's effort to make things right. To me, the food was simply not worth the high ratings on Yelp. During the course of dinner, I had to flag the waiters because the place was so busy. At one point, our tea pot was taken away to refill hot water, but it never returned.

I definitely recommend giving it a try and for me, personally, it tops the list as one of my favorite sandwiches ever.\\n\\nSimply having one killer, list-topping item on the menu that keeps me coming back again and again is enough to warrant a great impression. However, though Crema Cafe is in theory a great spot for catching up with friends and getting work done, in reality, it often feels too busy for it's own good- even picking up a sandwich to go, you'll be hard-pressed to find a place to stand and wait without being jostled, let alone a place to sit back and enjoy. And the uncertainty and even unlikeliness that you'll find a seat makes it a less attractive option for what would otherwise be an easy pick for a place to meet up with a friend.

My friend enjoyed her chicken salad sangy and the fries were perfect. \\nBottom line, The Mission Bar & Gill does many things well, Brunch just isn't one of them."},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Delicious breakfast skillet at 2 in the afternoon!

However it's a little less of a drive here and parking is pretty easy, so we decided to try it. I'm glad to say that it was a good choice that we did. By the way, this is a Korean run Japanese restaurant.\\n\\nWe arrived for a late Sunday lunch, about 1 pm. I was surprised to see that the restaurant was full and we were second in line for a table. Tip: immediately after walking in, write your name and party # down on their whiteboard on the left column.\\n\\nTako wasabi ($4.95): One of my favourite appetizers to order, and usually at a good price point. This came on a cold stone block, which was a nice touch. Octopus was a good consistency. Came with lots of seaweed and a good amount of octopus. Some bites had more of a kick from the wasabi than others. I would get this again.\\n\\nCrispy Holic Roll ($8.95): baked salmon, masago, crispy yam and potato bits on top; crab, cucumber, and avocado inside the roll. Pretty good, a nice crunch, not too overwhelmed with the crispy bits. There's a lot of sauce on this roll which gives it the flavour, I think. 8 pieces.\\n\\nOh Gami Roll ($13.95): an assortment of unagi, salmon, tuna, chopped scallop, seared, and 3 kinds of tobiko on top of the roll; tempura prawn, cucumber, avocado, and crab inside the roll. The presentation was very nice for this roll. Although 10 pieces, they were skinnier. I liked the seared taste of the toppings. This roll was better than the Crispy Holic, although more pricey. I would get this over the above.\\n\\nBeef terikayi bento ($9.75): this was a good value. It came with a lot of variety and a miso soup to start. It had four pieces of tempura, I think. The beef teriyaki on top of rice will fill you up. However the dressing for the salad was so sweet - I would not eat this.\\n\\nThis is closer to my house than other Japanese restaurants. It's a good neighbourhood choice for when we're feeling like Japanese. It's not overpriced, there is good service, nice presentation, and a decent quality of food.

We've lived here now, almost a year, and only just went over for dinner. It took the snow storm and our go-to place to be closed for the night but we finally made it over here. Honestly...not bad either. We've gone a few times now, mostly for the vibe. The pictures don't do it justice. I honestly thought the place looked like crap until I saw it in person. I was way off.. it's charming a lot like Cheers, the show. Everyone is very friendly and efficient. I love a wait staff that can joke with you and make you feel comfortable but I also like good food for a good price. This place isn't half bad. The food isn't wonderful but it's good and feels like home cooked meals thanks to the atmosphere; there must be hundreds of gold tea pots and gears all over the walls...weird but it fits this place so well. Seriously though, back in Jersey I used to eat Italian all the time. We have just as many Italian places as we do hair salons (every other business in every single town!)  so I wasn't impressed with their food or with their pizza. I've come to learn, and even like, Columbus pizza. If you're used to the pizza in the Midwest then this place is wonderful. Angies and Villa Nova have, by far, the best pizza around here. It's a circle pie cut family style, not triangles and the sauce is sweeter and the crust has corn meal in it...like they do out here. And just a tip for anyone back east reading this..when they say NY style pizza out here, it doesn't mean NY pizza. NY style pizza simply means round pizza with normal canned sauce, that happens to be cut into normal triangle slices. I don't think anyone in this part of the country knows what NY pizza is so you shouldn't get upset when youre fooled like I did. It wasn't until I ate here the first time that I truly understood that. I don't think anyone here really understand why we get upset, since theyre used to it. If you cant beat them, join them..right? Villa Nova's version of pizza is as close to perfect as the Midwest can get. If the dough is a little weird for you and you cant get used to it you should try Flying Pizza, they get it just right if you can ignore their serious attitude issues from time to time.\\n\\nI felt their dinners, although tasty, reminded me of frozen prepared food that was heated up in the back. I had the veal parm, which was two patties with cheese and sauce, nothing special. My husband got a pepperoni pizza which was tasty and why we went back later that week. Prices would be more fair lower or if they made their food on site. -and if they do, then I'm sorry. I will say that their angle hair pasta seemed homemade but I have no way of knowing since the veal patties through me off. $13 for veal patties...ehhhh I can make my own next time. \\n\\n3 stars is for their pizza which is the only reason we'll go back. and their breadsticks...those too!"},{"name":"Casa Chapala","address":"3010 W Anderson Ln, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I hated my experience here, the food was horrible and the management was very unprofessional.

Seems like it but I guess beef tallow is even better (and better for you!) than crack!  I try not to buy things I could make at home and one would think a chicken strip is no big deal.  But THESE chicken strips - moist, juicy, a really nice crisp crust and just overall yumminess.  I'm sold, not even going to try to recreate it at home - impossible!  The aioli is awesome also, though I don't find it very garlicky so I think aioli is a bit of a misnomer.  Also, sometimes those little plastic aioli cups are only half full.  So I'm crazy and ask for an extra one.  If I'm feeling really racy, I ask for one aioli and one ketchup.  I know, purely chicken strip madness.  Indulge, totally worth the $5.

They cook it fresh in front of you and it has just the right amount of batter. It's doesn't feel too greasy and is seasoned just right. To be honest, I have not had better Calamari, even at a sit down restaurant. So I either don't eat at enough Greek restaurants or this is as good as I'm telling you.\\n\\nLike any fast food type place, there are things where they have to take shortcuts on. They precook much of their souvlaki so it's not coming fresh off the grill. This is not typically problematic for this location because it's always so busy so it's not like everything has too much time to sit around and dry out. I've eaten here dozens of times and the worst meal I ever had was at 8:50pm when they were closing down and they gave me a souvlaki meal for half price and warned me it might be a bit overdone. Even with slightly dry chicken, it was still perfectly seasoned and I smothered it in tzatziki to eliminate the dryness issue.\\n\\nThey work pretty fast and will assemble your plate however you like.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and they are clearly working hard.

The first chance we got, we put in our drink orders, as well as our food orders (as we were nervous that it would take another 10 minutes for another opportunity to arise). \\n\\nNow at this point, one would expect the starter chips and salsa to arrive; ours never did! If you know me at all (or have read any of my other reviews), you know how important this aspect of the Mexican restaurant experience is to me. I love chips and salsa. Let me make this clear, the restaurant itself does serve complimentary chips and salsa, our waiter just forgot to provide us with some. \\n\\nOnce our food came (in a pretty timely manner), we (thankfully) noticed that they had switched out the dishes. While I am a vegetarian, my girlfriend is not. Our dishes were very similar looking, as we both got enchiladas, but hers contained chicken. You could see how this could create a problematic situation if we had not noticed the switch before diving in.\\n\\nThat was, unfortunately, not the biggest issue we had with the food. My girlfriend's meal contained a lot of cheese though she requested that they not put cheese on it. We ordered a small side of guacamole ($1.50), but it did not arrive until I was halfway done with my meal and my girlfriend was almost completely done with hers. \\n\\nAll of that being said, I actually enjoyed my meal. I got the vegetarian enchiladas ($9.95) and my girlfriend got the verde enchiladas ($9.95). Because she prefers black beans and I prefer refried beans and Mexican rice, we traded. The veggies in my enchiladas were a bit bigger than I would have liked in an enchilada, but overall the sauce and sides were very tasty.\\n\\nWhile the food was well-seasoned and appetizing and the actual restaurant has a very cool aesthetic, because of the service, I would honestly recommend going to another Mexican restaurant which will likely have equally delicious food but much better service."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This is one of those places i hate to give 5 stars to, but i must.

I then had the She Crab Soup, which was pretty good but no actual crab pieces, and the oyster appetizer that is with the julienned vegetables and spicy fried oysters. The oysters were ok, pretty spicy with wet bread underneath, which I don't ever like. My patron maragarita was ok, very strong. The person I was with had the choo-choo chop with johnny cakes.

This was served on a bowl with lots of garlic, chilis and white wine sauce.  The bowl was filled to the brim with clams with 2 pieces of bread on top.

Chilito is right down the block, go there, they are awesome. Hopdoddies I have not tried the original regular burger, so am not totally informed, but the Japanese-style beef burger for like $13 was blegh and not worth $3 let alone $13, I finished like a third and tired of it, took the leftover home with the rest of the fries, which were good, and threw out most of the burger after giving my dog a nibble. They have high overhead and a big brand to support though unlike Sapo, and the meat is supposedly rare, so you'd expect that price, but it was not tasty.

You have 5 \\"different\\" choices and two of them are Sesame Chicken and General Tsos Chicken which most places use interchangeably. \\n\\nIf you want an appetizer, which I usually want, your meal alone will run you 17$. As someone that doesn't cook, eating from this place will add up rather quickly, especially if you want delivery and leave a decent tip. \\n\\nThe food now was good, but again, I saw a layer of oil floating over the sauce underneath--that wasn't pleasant. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was really good. But seeing that I dropped over 17$ for that and potstickers, I noticed that the portions weren't big at all. This is coming from someone that can hardly finish a big mac, fries, and a drink. The combo comes in a three compartment Styrofoam container. Rice is scooped into both compartments and the rest in the larger third. None of it is full where you would look at it and say \\"wtf, this is amazing, feels like college all over again!\\"\\n\\nThe fried potstickers were okay, a tad bit underfried and rather steamed-like. The eggroll was perfectly fresh. The wonton soup I ordered was a bit salty, but a few ounce of Deer Park fixed that right up. \\n\\nWhile I was pleased with my meal it was a little too expensive for the food that I got. $13/14$ range would have been more adequate. I've had them 4 times but I'll try somewhere else next time.\\nThe staff are really nice though."},{"name":"Sabatino's Italian Kitchen","address":"242 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"For what is essentially a tiny little sub shop, this place really stands out.

So it's probably a good bet and certainly less expensive than above said places.\\n\\nBut we always order their pasta dishes and they are really good. The broccoli ziti is yum, chicken caccitore is great. The portions are huge and prices really decent. The pasta dishes are on par with a decent Italian restaurant I'd say. They seem tasty, fresh, not too oily/buttery, and they are cooked to order. They even offer wheat pasta (which I tried didn't like too mealy!)

The menu also features past dishes from other parts of the world. The grilled octopus, sweet chili okra, and the duck fat fingerling potatoes were a few of my favorites. All dishes are served tapas style so it makes it perfect for sharing, and it gives you a chance to taste as much as you want. The craft cocktails are also worth mentioning..

He's slow at making drinks.. because he's looking at a cheat sheet... all while pouring beverages over bottles of wine. I ordered meatballs and bread, and he had no remorse over the fact I was completely bread-less when it came time to devour these succulent morsels.. Not to mention I asked him 2 additional times for bread. It's fine though, the meatballs were delicious. Maybe I'm bratty, but I'm upset because the breads never came and this dude gave zero f's if I got a piece. When he finally cleared my plate (5 minutes after my drink and plate were completely clean), I informed him I never had the pleasure of receiving bread. He so hospitably responded \\"oh\\"...... Maybe I should take the hint that he believes I don't need the extra carbs. \\n\\nIn closing: teatro is great.. But employing humans of this mans sort makes me never want to endure the bar again.

Plenty of options, fantastic flavors, and some African dishes..... It is at the Animal Kingdom Lodge after all!\\n\\nTIPS:\\n* If you have the Disney annual pass, you save 10% for the whole table (as long as your all on the same bill)\\n\\n* If you download the \\"My Disney experience app\\", you can make reservations effortlessly - and I highly suggest you do because this place is very popular!\\n      \\n\\nI decided to go all out for breakfast in Feb and started looking at what Disney had to offer. My favorite Disney character is Stich, so I was naturally drawn to Ohana. Sure they have waffles in the shape of Stitch, but there wasn't much of a  selection, and I have to have a good variety when I eat at a buffet.\\n\\nI researched a bit more and found Boma. First of all, I'd never been to the animal Kingdom Lodge before, and secondly I heard there was a LOT of options. \\n\\nI made reservations and was very glad I did because there was an hour wait. We did wait a little, I'd say 5-10 minutes, we're sat, and the POG was poured (passionfruit, orange, and guava). I forgot what they renamed it but that's what it is. It's a deep orange color with a hint of pink and it is Sweet, with a tart finish. I've never been a fan but it was a sensation at our table and with most others. They do have cranberry juice, you just need to ask the server for it and they will get it for you.\\n\\nOn to the FOOD:\\n \\nThe start of the fine features some authentic African dishes. Nothing too crazy but it's exploding with great flavor. I'd recommend sampling a tiny bit of each to see if you like them and because it's not dishes you can easily fine elsewhere.\\n\\nMove a bit further down the line and there's the carving station with a wood fire meat rotisserie right behind it. They have ribeye and a brisket to choose from. Both beautifully cooked and juicy inside with a  flavorful light crust on the outside. Venture onward and you'll find some of the more common American breakfast items such as pancakes, eggs, waffles in the shape of Nala from The Lion King, a variety of different fruits, cold cures of meats and cheeses, an only station (disclaimer, they're a bit on the small side) and everything in between.\\n\\nThe very end of the line is what I like to refer to as the Carb village. All of the delish baked goods you could think of are located here: such as muffins, cookies,  croissants, muffins, English muffins, toast, bagels of different varieties, and my personal favorite the sticky bun.think of a small super moint cinnamon bun and then add then doust it in a decidant sugary pecan sauce.

I have had the problems with wait time for seating and food, and the two Mexican martini limit is enforced by humiliation, but I love the stuffed avocado and Mex marts. I cannot help it. However, the other day was my last trip to this restaurant ever in my life. \\n\\nLet me preface this with the fact that our waitress was awesome and very nice, but apparently, she was not taken seriously by her own manager. We were seated at a table that was literally a few feet from another table filled with rowdy people that only had alcohol in front of them. This was around 8 PM too on a weeknight, so there was definitely a good mix of people. The guys at the table began whistling at and yelling at our waitress for service while she was trying to take our drink order. When she walked to the table to help them, they said they wanted to take her home and f%$k her, and you could tell she was so embarrassed. She walked away to tell her manager, but the table was not kicked out. This was enough for the table next to us to go ahead and leave mid-meal. \\n\\nAfter listening to this table go on for another 20 minutes screaming about butt holes, hymens, or anything else in they could come up with that was disgusting to hear while trying to eat, one of them literally sneezed on the back of my husband. I was ready to walk out at this point, but my husband talked to the manager. She made him wait about 10 min in the middle of our meal to speak with her, and then told my husband that she would take care of it. She came over to US about 10 min after that, and when she heard the table screaming about Nazis, I guess that is when she thought maybe they had enough to drink. These guys made a small fuss (I imagine that is not the first time they have been thrown out of a public place) and left. \\n\\n20 minutes after this, the manager came to tell us she was sorry about that table. Her excuse was, \\"Well, they were here the past few nights for a going away party, and I did not hear what exactly was being said.\\" Basically, she inferred that they were a high dollar table and for that, they could say whatever they wanted in a public setting where other people are paying to eat.   \\n\\nThe waitress came up to us afterward and thanked us for saying something. She said that when she told her manager initially, the female manager told her it was a $200 table. The waitress was just trying to be nice to them to get her tip, which I don't blame her for one bit. What I do blame the manager for is allowing these male patrons to openly sexually harass a waitress and not do anything about it because they were spending a lot of money on alcohol. And then to be addressed about the situation by a regular patron and do NOTHING about it for 20-30 minutes is unacceptable. \\n\\nAlso, if they are so strict on the 2 Mex mart limit, then why on earth would they serve margarita after margarita to these people when they were clearly over the line and limit?  The waitress told us herself that they had been there for a couple of hours before we came in, so a table can come drink margaritas all they want for as long as they want, as long as no one orders the Mex mart.  It has nothing to do with the amount of alcohol served, the bahvior of the drunk guests, butonly about one specific drink.\\n\\nNever again will I go back there, so I hope that the rest of the Mexican restaurants in Austin (there are about 5,000, so Trudy's needs to remember they are not the only and far from the best game in town) are willing to accept my money in exchange for a harassment free environment to eat in."},{"name":"Great Harvest Bread Company","address":"8926 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here for bread today, because my neighbor had given my husband and I some.

There was so much hype behind Be Our Guest before we arrived. Disney vloggers loved it and I hated it (the food).\\n\\nThe theme and design of the dining rooms were nicely done. The West Wing has the rose, a portrait of Beast changes every 20 minutes or so. It's darker and unique. The Rose Gallery is a pretty room but it is closed off for dinner. It's only open for dinner and breakfast. I found this to be a little strange. Be Our Guest is probably to most sought after restaurant for reservations on Disney Property and they chose to close an entire dining section. It just seems like a big waste of space and profit. The Grand Ballroom is where most people will dine because it's the largest room of the three. There are gigantic chandeliers from above, painted cherubs and all. It's nice but it can get crowded and noisey in this room. As you dine, Beast makes an occasional appearance every 20 minutes or so. Music changes and he makes his way around the rooms, waves and bows and heads back to the study room where you can take a picture with him. This is the only place in Disney World where you can get a photograph and autograph from the Beast. That's a little fact to know if you're really into collecting autographs from all of the characters.\\n\\nAs for the food and service, it was horrible. Again, each meal was over $30, portion was small but much larger than what they serve st Cinderella's Royal Table. My wife and I ordered their steak and their braised beef.\\n\\nGrilled steak $36 - medium rare, it tasted very old. Lack of flavor and juices. It tasted like a very low grade steak purchased from Western Beef. Steak was also served on a cold plate, the temperature of the steak drastically dropped which caused the meat to taste very rubbery when it got cold.\\n\\nBraised beef - this dish was highly recommended by the waitress and many vloggers and bloggers. It didn't taste bad but come on, $32 for 1 piece of braised beef??? My wife makes better braised beef than this. Just not worth the price. Over hyped, I would definitely try something else.\\n\\nMickey Kids check meal - the seafood of the day they had was shrimp. It came with a side, we chose vegetables for our son because he likes broccoli. This entire meal was trash. First of all, the waitress told us our kids meal is included in our dining plan. When the check came, it wasn't included because this meal didn't fall under the free meals for kids they have at Disney. She didn't clairfy that with me from the beginning which pissed me off. The shrimp and broccoli were both old as shit. The shrimp had a very fishy smell. It smelled old or wasn't cleaned thoroughly. My son spat out the broccoli which was a surprise. He loves broccoli especially on his pizza. When he spat it out, we couldn't believe it. My wife and I took a bite of the broccoli and knew why. It was undercooked and wasn't fresh to begin with.\\n\\nDessert - The grey stuff right?? Every Disney World fanboy raves about the grey stuff. It's a cream with grey coloring....wow.... Y'all got poor taste. We tried the grey stuff and the eclair. Meh... I still can't understand what the hype was about.\\n\\nVerdict - if you wanna dine at Be our Guest just for the sake of saying you dined there, then please go ahead. But if you're expecting quality food and services, please save your table service credit and money for something else.

The Mac and cheese looked like it has been left out for a couple of hours and did not even have that pork belly that was advertised on the menu.  Considering that most of these items are $10-15, you're better off just going to some buffet like Golden Corral because that's the quality you are getting.

If you are a somewhat adventurous eater and don't want to live off hot dogs and hamburgers during your trip to WDW (which really, who does?), stop at Boma in the Animal Kingdom Lodge!\\n\\nWhat I Love:\\n1) Boma is a buffet-style, all-you-can-eat restaurant.  Disney has a lot of those, and for the most part, they're relatively homogeneous - mac & cheese, chicken fingers, some type of meat.  Boma is nothing like your typical buffet.  First, they have a wide selection of healthy items.  Lots of salads, amazing salad dressings (I love the mango vinaigrette), and delicious soups!  There are usually 5 soups for you to choose from, ranging from ginger carrot to a seafood hotpot.  YUM!\\n\\n2) In addition to fantastic salads and soups, Boma has some fantastic main courses.  There is a selection of meat which usually includes salmon, some type of African-spiced chicken, and prime rib.  The cola barbecue sauce that comes alongside the meat is fantastic as well.  They also serve sides such as sweet potato mash & couscous.\\n\\n3) Dessert at Boma is HEAVENLY.  People go nuts for the Zebra Domes (mini-mounds of chocolate, liqueur-soaked mousse), which are good, but my personal favorite is the warm banana bread pudding and vanilla bean sauce.  To die for.  The miniature fruit tarts are also fantastic.\\n\\n4) The fact that it's located in Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge - an absolutely gorgeous hotel!  Come early, walk through the stunning lobby, and take a nature walk to view the animals.\\n\\nWhat I Don't So Much Love:\\n1) The major thing that keeps me from giving Boma 5-stars is the extremely noisy, crowded atmosphere.  We know it's Disney and to be expected, but you are really packed in.  The restaurant is lovely, inviting, and well-themed (African savannah-ish in feel), but it gets really crowded and loud really quickly.\\n\\n2) Due to Boma's immense popularity (see above), it is extremely difficult to get a reservation if you don't call months in advance.  You're able to make a Boma reservation 180 days before you dine, and I highly recommend you call Disney Dining (or hop on their website) as soon as you know your trip dates.\\n\\nDespite those two drawbacks, if you have the time in your Disney vacation to step off the beaten path for a meal, Boma is a fantastic place to do so.

Food was decent"},{"name":"Le Patissier at Troquet","address":"140 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We liked the savory offerings @ Le Patissier better than the actual desserts and well that's a problem for a place specializing in desserts. Started with the braised short rib sliders and the grilled pizzetta (flat bread pizza) and was pleasantly surprised by 1) portion size 2) the tastiness of the food. The pizzetta was thin and crispy with oozing mozzarella and a rich tomato sauce. My one complaint was that it was served on a long and narrow board -- almost like a cheese board or even a cutting board. The problem is that the pizzetta didn't really fit on the board and everything overlapped which meant things were kind of stuck together and falling apart when you pulled one piece of the pizzetta off the other. Perhaps using a different sized board would be better. \\n\\nThe braised short rib sliders were perfect 2-3 bite bits of goodness. They were great though I didn't taste the gorgonzola sauce. They were delicious! The portabello added a nice meaty touch. The homemade potato chips was also a nice touch, but I wish I had a little bit of salt for them. I think paying $16 for these sliders was a bit much and despite the tastiness I'm not sure I'd pay that much for these again. \\n\\nFor dessert we each got a souffle -- I ordered the dark chocolate souffle and my significant other had the grand marnier souffle. A couple of problems: when our beautiful souffles were brought to the table our waitress immediately cut into them and poured the sauce in the center. This is a problem because my other really doesn't like chocolate sauce and was taken aback by this. Plus the sauce was a cloyingly sweet chocolate and didn't go great with her taste. I would recommend a variety of sauces being offered to allow those with different taste buds to choose something to their liking. I also recommend they take a taste of that chocolate sauce and rework it so it's not so grossly sweet. Yes it's chocolate, but c'mon. \\n\\nAnother problem is that we couldn't tell who had the dark chocolate souffle and who had the grand marnier because they tasted identical. I mean, I literally did not taste any dark chocolate other than the sauce. It was...kind of bland. The bright spot of this dish was the tiny scoop of ice cream. Mine came with mint chocolate chip and my significant other had dark chocolate. We switched and were both pleased with our decision. \\n\\nLastly, I have an issue with the service. We arrived shortly before closing and it definitely showed. We heard a multitude of inappropriate-for-customers-to-hear work conversations. We were also asked to pay our check before we had even received our food and it was just a bit awkward for us. I say, if you are open until a certain time then everyone needs to be on point until the last guests leave. No bickering, no beer drinking or drinking of the last bit of milk (yes we heard THAT conversation), no complaining about schedules until the last customer walks out the door. OR they should have told us they were closed. The pastry chef is obviously talented, but the overall experience wasn't something I'd write home about and the cost, oh the cost was just not worth the outcome. 2-stars for the savory food, minus 1 star for the desserts, minus 1 star for the service, and minus 1 star for the cost."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"A cool place to have a couple drinks.

The space before was old and dingy with a rickety front deck. The group that developed Smokebelly did a WONDERFUL job! The restaurant is fresh and clean on the inside, with thoughtful furnishings and plenty of TVs for the sports enthusiasts. The front patio is awesome as well - with green turf brightening up the space, which is dotted with booths and lounge seating. There are two bars inside the restaurant, so this is the perfect place to come if you are looking for a drink with friends or dinner with your family. \\n\\nThe drink menu is quite large, with a good mix of fun specialty cocktails and craft beers. The staff has always been very friendly and demonstrated positive attitudes and a willingness to please the guests. \\n\\nHaven't been with a large group in a while, but when Smokebelly first opened (and it was constantly packed), they would not seat you unless the entire party was present. Keep this in mind if you are planning a dinner with friends. \\n\\nNow on to the food...each table is provided pork grinds free of charge to munch on while you peruse the menu. They are OK, but not really my thing. The absolute best appetizer on the menu is the corn dogs. They are battered and fried perfectly, and the sauce that is served with (sort of mustardy) is diving. My husband is also a big fan of the pimento cheese appetizer, and though I don't like pimento cheese, the pita chips that are served with it are delicious. \\n\\nI always opt for the pulled pork platter (I have noticed that the price has gone up since they first opened last year), which comes with a heap of pulled pork, pickles, toast, and two sides. The best sides are by far the corn succotash and the baked beans, but the cinnamon apple sauce is good too! There is a BBQ sauce bar where you can fill up condiment cups and try out different ones with your meal. While the BBQ is good (not great), I have been disappointed a few times with the quality of the meat (very fatty and a lot of pieces not edible). \\n\\nThe atmosphere of this place is what really sells me - a bar without feeling like \\"a bar\\" that serves good food and drinks and gives you the opportunity to catch a game on TV."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"6417 Raleigh St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to.

We tried to go Super Bowl Sunday, but they were closed (odd). That being said, four of us finally had an opportunity to try Watch City out this past weekend.\\n\\nBeers:\\nVery disappointing. This place labels itself a brewing company but produces brews similar to what I expect to get from my friends Mr. Beer self brewing kit. Between the four of us we sampled three different brews. Their golden ale tasted a lot like flat watered down Harpoon UFO. The red ale was also flat and had little flavor. My preferred choice, and I use preferred very very loosely and in a relative manner, was the cask IPA. While this beer was also very flat, at least it had some flavor but nowhere close to the amount of body an IPA should have. Unfortunately they didn't have their bacon beer on tap, but I didn't deduct points for that because like most brew companies, they have a rotation and it was just bad timing.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nWe all split an order of the calamari and buffalo wings. The calamari was a meager serving that had no flavor whatsoever. I'm guessing they pulled it straight out of the Sysco Food bag and dropped it in the fryer. The wing's were okay with an acceptable amount of meat on them. The buffalo flavor lacked a strong flavor, however, and was a little too sweet. It tasted almost like they accidentally spilled some honey barbecue in their hot sauce. \\n\\nMain Course:\\nBetween the four of us we got two burgers, a steak sandwich, and a cuban. I will say this, the burgers were cooked perfectly. My fiance and I both thought they were pretty good, we both got ours blackened which added some much needed flavor. However, for $13 dollar burgers, I expected something more novel. The steak sandwich was made up of real steak chunks. Overall, the flavor was great. When you got a bite of tender steak it was a great sandwich. The downfall of this entree was the size of the chunks made it difficult to eat, and there was too much gristle. I don't like steak sandwiches where you end up pulling out a whole piece of steak because you can't bite it off. I can't say much about the cuban as I didn't try it. My friend thought it was alright.\\n\\nService:\\nIt was pretty busy and I only saw one or two waitresses serving the entire seating area. Nothing really to write home about here.\\n\\nPrice:\\nOverpriced for what it offered.\\n\\nChance of return:\\nNone.

I discovered this place via Yelp and, once again, Yelp did not let me down!  Pronounced Dreh-Leez, it's a little restaurant in the center of Tamarack Circle in North Columbus.  The owners used to run a restaurant in Ghana, so the authenticity is unquestionable.\\n\\nThe dining room had six 4-person tables, not huge, but it didn't need to be.  The interior was very Mom-and-Pop, nice but not fancy.  We arrived and started looking at the menu (available online at www.Drelyse.com) and everything sounded great.  We threw ourselves on the mercy of our host, the husband of the owner and a wonderful food guide.  So kind and attentive, he did his best to steer us 'first-timers' to flavors more suited to the Western palate, but we assured him that we were foodies who had come for authentic food.  He then, happily, pointed out the local favorites, local to Ghana that is. \\n \\nAs we went over the menu, he brought 2 small bowls of soup for us to sample (like I said, he was very kind).  One was goat soup and the other was peanut-butter beef soup and both had a few small bits of FuFu in it, a starchy, doughy dumpling.  We tasted and swapped and decided they were both terrific.  Drinking right from the bowl, the broths were so very rich and deep in flavor that I almost forgot to share.  The beef soup was spicy and the goat soup was spicier, but neither was overly spicy and the flavor of the soup was complimented not overwhelmed, just enough to put a little sweat on the brow.  We grabbed a pair of Tusker ales/beers, from Kenya, to wash it all down and it went well with the spicy food.  Tusker is similar to Guinness, dark, strong, with a slightly nutty back-note.\\n\\nOur host explained that West African food is eaten with the hands and asked if we wanted silverware.  We decided to remain true to the food.  If it's to be eaten with your hands, so be it!  He brought over a small ceramic basin of soapy water.  We dipped our hands and gave them a quick wash.  He then produced a ceramic jug of clean water which he poured over our hands to rinse them.  I love a good food ritual, so this was fun and elegant at the same time.\\n\\nThe samples really hadn't helped because now we wanted to taste everything!  In the end, we decided on Sambusa and Vitumbua for appetizers.  Sambusa is a small flaky pastry filled with spiced meat (and I mean filled, more meat than pastry) and served with a spicy-sweet sauce.  Crisp and deliciously meaty.  The Vitumbua was a dense, chewy fried dough muffin/biscuit/cake, lightly sweet but also savory at the same time.  A great start!\\n\\nWe chose Goat Soup and Jollof Rice with Chicken for our entrees.  Our host brought out two steaming plates plus a softball-sized bread round.  The bread round was actually a dish called Banku and it's a sticky ball of fermented cassava dough that felt very much like uncooked bread dough (just MUCH stickier, you have to eat it off your fingers or you'll never get it off).  Grab a sticky wad of Banku, use it to grab a piece of meat from the soup, and eat both.  Banku has a potato-ish taste and goes great with their soup.  Tasty and fun!  The Jollof Rice was bright red with a lovely sauce on top and I have never tasted rice with that much flavor before.  No tableware, so the banku was used to eat the rice too.  The tomatoes and onions on top of the chicken were spectacular and I cannot pretend to know how they made them taste so good.  Maybe they were pickled, might be magic, but they were far tastier than the plain onion and tomato they seemed to be.  The chicken, ah the chicken, I don't know what spices were on it, but it was really tender and so good.  Packed with flavor through and through, not just a coating, but a permeated flavor that made for some really good eating right down to the last morsel!\\n\\nI'm a pretty big eater, but, since every bite included some banku, I filled up long before I cleaned my plate   And I really wanted to clean my plate!  And I wanted to clean the plates of the people sitting next to us (their fish dish looked awesome, takes 40 minutes to cook, so call ahead for that).  I really wanted to be hungry again so I could order other items from the menu, but I was so stuffed that I didn't have room for dessert (or a deep breath).\\n\\nWe repeated the hand-washing ritual again to clean up, but I wish I hadn't because, now, hours later, I would be happy if my hands tasted and smelled like their amazing food.\\n\\nI can honestly say it was better than finger licking good, it was lick-your-friend's-fingers good.  Heck, it was knock-your-Momma-down good (yeah it's THAT good).  I am looking forward to tasting every item on their menu, so I'm already planning a return trip.  And it's only five minutes from my house!

Rather like the city itself.\\n\\nUpon entering the place you get the raw feeling and the very friendly bartenders quickly compensated for a not so prompt hostess.

Then things went a little downhill - quite edible but did not any expose the freshness or balance of the food.\\n\\nThe pappardelle with nettles pesto (or thick ribbon pasta with pesto sauce) was a complete let down from expectations.  Well cooked pasta but the sauce was little more than the equivalent of butter and green coloration; uniform flavor as murky as an overcast Portland sky and uninspiring.  It could have benefited from 'bright' spots or a accompaniment to show some freshness of the pesto and flavor.  Best to stick to a half plate.\\n\\nThe beef entree was very tender and could hold its own by itself but the cumin and chili sauce mixture did not stick well and was over salted.  Once again, there was not an accompaniment to balance off the flavor (game and higher salt)\\n\\nFinally, the wait staff was prompt and the show put on by the open area kitchen reminded me that good food does take time.

I had a conversation with my sandwich maker where I told her that not only did I not want the suggested cheese that comes with the sandwich, but that I did not want any cheese at all. Somehow and somewhere between that conversation and the sandwich coming out of the oven, there was cheese all over it. I pointed this out and she rolled her eyes at me. She was completely unapologetic. My boyfriend had already paid for the sandwiches so I had no choice but to stand there and have to wait for them to remake it for me. And it was sloppy and poorly cut.\\nI know that Potbelly probably cannot get better quality workers. I know that it's probably just college students who don't give a damn. But the very least Potbelly can do is to train their workers to be polite. I get so much better service at my local Subway. There, you can have a conversation with your sandwich maker and they still manage to make the sandwich correct the first time. And if even a mistake were to be made, they would be apologetic and fix it right away. \\nI rarely go to Potbelly, and this is the reason why. Every time I go in there, it's an absolute disaster.

And it was for dessert that my friend and I came based on her past experience.\\n\\nNow, I am sure the main courses are fine - they certainly sound delicious.  But if you stop for nothing else, stop for the sweets.  You can probably share one between two people, and doing over that might have been a better idea for us.  However, it was hard enough to decide on just one for each of us, let alone one for both. \\n\\nWe eventually decided on a piece of the white chocolate bread pudding and slice of chocolate cake with toffee and caramel.  ...Yes, they're as good as they sound.  \\n\\nThe bread pudding was unfortunately a bit overcooked on the bottom on this trip, but still tasted amazing.  As I've said before elsewhere, I'm not normally a fan of bread pudding, but I could be a fan of this.  Thick, dense, and more like a pudding cake than the typical slimy stuff that makes me wary of this dessert, it is definitely worth the calories.  \\nThe cake, meanwhile, is huge in size and consists of moist chocolate cake with layers of crunchy toffee and a semi-sweet not-too-thick icing dusted with toffee and cocoa, served on a bed of gooey smokey caramel sauce.  I loved the combination of smooth cake with the crunchy toffee, and the caramel and chocolate blended very nicely together. \\nBoth were about $5.95 which is about average for this sort of dessert, and the quality was such I would say they were worth it.\\n\\nCafe Bisto also has decent coffee - not super exceptional but definitely better than most restaurants.  \\n\\nOverall, definitely worth stopping in upstairs for an upscale sweet treat when visiting Easton.\\nI hope to get back at some point and give the actual food a go too.  :)"},{"name":"The Upper Crust","address":"118 Washington St","city":"Salem","stars":"2.5","text":"I first discovered The Upper Crust Pizza in Boston at their original location on Charles St.  It was love at first slice!

The taco was perfect with cucumber, lime, onion and cilantro, and made with 2 soft and pliable(not stale) corn tortillas. The meat was slow cooked to perfection and was a lot like brisket. The pozole was a very nice surprise. I was expecting a thick stew with stringy pork, but instead I got an incredibly well flavored, very red soup with hominy and chunks of melt in your mouth pork. It was absolutely perfect and went well with the shredded cabbage, cilantro and onions they serve it with on the side.

There's a nice little outdoors seating area (probably best for lunch and dinners before 10pm). Seating inside is nicer than I was expecting, some booths, some tables. Pretty clean all around.\\n\\nFood itself: I asked the server for \\"something a little different.\\" He suggested pan noodles, so that's what I got: Pan Noodles with Beef. It was the right mix of something expected with something surprising. The flavor of the beef and veggies was along the lines of what you'd expect from most American-Chinese establishments. Beef wasn't chewy, veggies were crisp and not limp. Not overly salted. The twist here was the noodles. It was under everything else, so depending on which part, you got a different texture. The noodles (thin, and pan fried) were crunchy if they weren't touched by the sauce-- think the little brick of ramen before you cook it. But the noodles that had soaked up the sauce were more tender. Overall flavor really hit the spot for my Chinese food craving. I would definitely recommend it. It was only $12, and serving was large enough for me to eat twice. \\n\\nIf you want something more common, they do have several \\"dinner combos\\" (lunch ones too for cheaper and smaller portions). It'll include an egg roll and choice of soup, with steamed or fried rice.

I was surprised... so I called my credit card company and the rep said the CDV code was entered incorrectly (by the cashier).

So, she ran off to get the specials sheets and came back with a, how to put this, \\"must have been a place mat of someone that had horrible aim\\" specials sheets.  \\n\\nShe asked again what we wanted to order.

Shortly, we were brought glasses of water, but one person was forgotten.  We made note of this and the server said she would bring one with the coffees.  Then again, we waited.  Another, 15 minutes later, we had our coffees, juices and final water.\\n\\nAt this point, my mood was starting to become spoiled.  I tried to make the most of it by just having some good conversation with my brunch friends.  I noticed some of the other servers were providing baskets of bread to the other tables around us.  However, we were receiving no bread.  Eventually, I saw our server go over and start cutting some bread and became excited.  It didn't take much to excite me at this point as we were now over 1.25 hours from our original reservation with many long wait times.  As she started to head to our table, my brain then kicked in \\"she's not coming to our table with that\\".  Sure enough, she gave it to another table: a table that had come in after us.  Eventually, we were given bread less than a minute or two before our meals arrived.  As some other yelpers have written, it was just white bread, not the specialty bread it appears some other yelpers have talked about.\\n\\nThe two meals I remember were mine and my best friends that were an Omelet and Eggs Benedict for about $12 and $15 respectively. Both only mildly warm.  The portions themselves were small and the side of house potatoes consisted of 4-5 small wedges (at absolutely most the size of 3 fingerling potatoes).  Needless to say I wasn't thrilled.\\n\\nTo top it all off, the coffee I had (which I will admit was very, very good) was $3 bucks to start and then $1.25 a refill. Looking back on it, this is the one thing they did actually keep asking when we did see the server \\"would you like refill on your coffee?\\" Now, it makes sense.  I only had one refill, but still $4.25 for two regular sized cups of coffee is not something I anticipate or want for brunch. With all the waiting, meal time and paying the check, it was a total time of close to 2.5 hours for brunch.\\n\\nSince we went, my friends went back another time (just the two of them) and received a similar experience.  They apologized to me later and said it wasn't like this the first time they went.  I don't blame my friends at all, since the first time they went they had nothing, but good things to say.  However, based on my experiences and the experience they had after, I doubt I will ever go back unless I hear from someone else, things have changed.  If I have anything to say for now, it's don't let my sacrifice be in vain!

At least 80% of the tables in the section I requested were empty yet she insisted everything was reserved. Things went downhill from there. As an appetizer we ordered a small plate of \\"Award Winning\\" fries. If you don't know what an actual hand-cut french fry tastes like, then perhaps you would give these frozen fast food fries topped with garlic and parsley an award. But if you are accustomed to unprocessed foods, these miss the mark by a mile. For my dinner I ordered the simple grilled mahi mahi which arrived swimming in butter. The asparagus was overcooked. Green beans were perfectly prepared and garlic was a nice touch but again swimming in butter. My daughter's salmon arrived in a color that absolutely does not exist in nature. Coincidentally (or not) her piece of fish was the exact same shape and size as mine. Because, you know, all fish are exactly the same shape and size in nature. She surrendered after a few bites and I was relieved as I didn't want her consuming dyed fish. I would far prefer to throw away $17.99 than to feed her crap. The smashed potatoes she ordered were bland and the consistency of paste. My husband ordered fish tacos and was underwhelmed. My youngest ordered off the kids menu. There were two 2-3\\" chicken fingers that passed a 4 year-olds palate. As we left the restaurant at least 50% of the \\"fully reserved\\" section was still unoccupied.

Again, ( no biggie) however, the whole time we felt rushed. \\n\\nWe decided to have dessert, but I decided I was going to sit and enjoy my meal and not allow anyone to rush us from that point on. \\n\\nObviously, the service is not Parisian in anyway, we never feel rush in Paris. \\n\\nWe are normally 20+ tippers, I come from a food background, however I refused to monetarily compliment bad service. It wasn't bad service per se it was rushed. We opted to leave 15%. Which I thought was generous.  \\n\\nThe reason for two stars is that the food was good. \\n\\nThe scallops with the truffle oil risotto was excellent. The Boeuf Bourguignon was good; lack a bit of salt. The charcuterie board was good also. The bread was anything but French. \\n\\nYou can skip the beignets, they were a bit greasy."},{"name":"Laughing Planet","address":"909 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Awesome paleo & organic food!

We finally got the table, but there were only 2 chairs and our server proceeded to walk away and not come back for the next 10 mins. After standing and waiting for 5 minutes hoping I would get a chair, I finally got one myself from an empty table (the place was busy so there weren't a lot of chairs available).Additional issues included: no waters offered!!! only 2 plates for the three of us and not enough napkins. This is of course besides the crappy service of a snarky waiter. \\n\\nThe food is also a disappointment here. Although the tacos are decent, they are expensive!! They are $4 per little taco! I'm not sure how many you would need to be full but I was still pretty hungry after 3 and queso dip. The tacos were also pretty bland. The fish tacos were good but they didn't have enough of the tasty sauce that was on them. The short rib taco was ok but dry and it didn't  have any dressing. \\n\\nOh queso.... You are not a queso, you are a roux with broiled cheese on top! Literally people, this is a roux that has not been properly put together with broiled cheese on top. I can agree, the broiled cheese was good, but below that was a combination of flour butter and water. No thank you!\\n\\nI will not come here often, but I will come back if I ever get a craving for the spicy margarita. And next time, definitely won't order the food. Definitely not happy spending over $20 on the tacos and queso and still being hungry!"},{"name":"Sushi 21","address":"54 Mt.

Huge loss on the (rare) authentic Japanese food community. Rising fish price and town rule that the restaurant has to be closed at certain time (like can't stay open late at night etc)  were the few things he mentioned. Now I am homeless... \\n\\nMy favorite restaurant in Watertown. \\nYou gotta try \\"Sushi 21 Bento\\", which is Tempura, Teriyaki (chiken and beef), AND Sushi.

Say hi to Tetsu, the owner...\\n\\n...UPDATED 6/19/07 They changed their menu and got rid of Sushi 21 bento... pretty big disappointment for me. They reduced the menu in order to have the meal to customer quicker, and therefore, make the service better, which is a good idea. If you have eaten there you know what I am talking about. I went there Sunday night (a slow night) and it seemed that the food did come out little quicker than in the past, so I bet it would help a lot on the busy nights.\\n\\nI still stand by what i stated before, they do have the best sushi in this area. The price is reasonable (considering Japanese food in general is expensive and I guess fish price recently is going up...)  and (if you order the right stuff), you will walk out there full.

We checked in with our reservations and were told we would have to wait a few minutes extra and that they were booked up that was no problem. We only had to wait maybe an extra 3-4 minutes before we were sat down. The host and hostess were both very kind and quickly took us to our seats where we were quickly greeted by a very friendly server. We were brought hot towels to wash our hands in and then explained the menu and the wine menu. I had wine and my Fiancee had a margarita and both of our drinks were wonderful. The artisan cheese selection was probably my favorite part of my meal, I love cheese and this was some really good cheese, especially the Bayley Hazen Blue with a little bit of honey.  For our entree I had the Maize-crusted Tilefish and it was pretty good, it had a very lobster like texture I think next time I would like to try something different but it definitely wasn't bad, it was actually wonderful if you like that lobster like texture.

There are sprinkles on the outside of the building. The inside is bright and colorful with space to sit, shop, and eat.\\n- Service: The NadaMoo team is positive, helpful, and fun. You can tell they are excited and passionate about their product and their jobs.\\n- Ice Cream: While I won't say every flavor tastes completely like dairy ice cream, many of them do. At the scoop shop I tried lotta mint chip and cookie dough fudge. I am a huge mint chip ice cream fan, and NadaMoo's is one of the best I've ever had. It tastes like fresh mint and there is no coconut taste. The cookie dough fudge is coconut ice cream based. It's the perfect flavor for any one with a sweet tooth who also loves coconut. While I didn't try their mooshakes, you can choose to mix in coffee or coconut milk. I can't wait to try one on my next visit!\\n- Value: NadaMoo is not only delicious, but the prices at the scoop shop are very reasonable compared to most hip ice cream shops.

And to think, we almost didn't even get the chance to do so! Before we left for our trip, I went online to make a reservation for my husband and I to eat here. Sadly, lunch reservations for every single day we were supposed to be in Disney had already been booked. I had cut it too close to our trip, and completely ruined our chances of eating at this incredible place. However, the Disney gods were apparently on our side, because my husband decided to check again DURING our trip, and he was able to make a reservation! I guess somebody decided to cancel at the last minute, and my husband was able to jump in and take their spot. It's pretty obvious that some Disney stars aligned that day, and I can't even begin to explain how happy I am that they did. \\n\\nThis place is huge. There are three different dining rooms that you are able to choose from. However, (in my opinion) there are only two that you SHOULD choose from. If you're going to eat here, definitely sit in either the ballroom or the West Wing. Both are absolutely incredible, and anyone who loves the movie is definitely going to love the opportunity to step inside of it for a meal. Regardless of what you choose, make sure you take a walk around the rest of the restaurant before you leave. If you're able to get yourself inside of this place, be sure to enjoy as much of it as you possibly can. \\n\\nAs for the food, it's truly just as incredible as the decor. Sure, it doesn't have the ability to cause a constant stream of snow outside, but it's still rather delicious if you ask me! And if you're eating here, you have to order dessert. It's really not even an option. If you come to Be Our Guest and don't order The Grey Stuff, I'm pretty sure you've truly made the biggest mistake of your existence. The Grey Stuff is possibly the most incredible thing that I've ever consumed in my entire life thus far. I knew it was supposed to be delicious, but wow. I can't even think about this cupcake without getting extremely upset that I don't have one constantly at the ready to be devoured. It really is that good, and you really need to be sure to get it whilst you're there. \\n\\nOh, and if you're worried that such an incredible experience is going to completely empty your wallet, fear not! Well, for lunch anyway. Our two entrees and a cupcake only cost us $30.95. That's absolute madness. Not only is this some of the best food on Disney property, but it's some of the cheapest food too! So, if the Disney gods allow it, definitely make a reservation, eat here, and try The Grey Stuff (it truly is delicious)! Just make sure that Beast doesn't find you in the West Wing of his castle (in that case, you'll be sorry)."},{"name":"The Lion & Rose","address":"701 S Capital of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Sort of divided about giving this place a three or four star rating.

This is ironic, since Arlington used to be known for two things a couple of decades ago--pizza places and banks. But most of the pizza places around back then were mediocre, and most of them today are average to good. But there are a few that are better than the rest, including Sabatino's in East Arlington. This is probably the closest you'll find to foldable New York-style pizza in Arlington, and they do a good version of that type of thin-crust pizza.

After we were seated, a woman came to our table and introduced herself and told us that she would take care of our water order. We chose a bottle of Acqua Panna Toscana, which according to the server was imported from Italy.  The bottle did make a nice souvenir and survived the flight home in our checked baggage. \\n\\nNext up we ordered our main courses.  I ordered their Paccheri alla Crema con Pollo while my wife ordered the Candele.  Both were excellent and both servings were of individual servings sizes, so we had just enough to eat.  I can't speak highly enough of my entree. The macaroni was tender, the cream sauce was light and very tasty while the chicken and Pancetta were both delicious and complimented each other very well. \\n\\nBased on the waiter's recommendation, I had a glass of Moretti beer with my meal and my wife had a glass of a Riesling wine.  Again, both were good and both refreshed us on a hot day in Florida.  \\n\\nFinally we had their Tiramisu for dessert.  Up until this point, I thought I had eaten good Tiramisu, but I was wrong.

After a day of sitting in the trunk, the donuts surprisingly held up really well. No melting glazes to be found and the texture was still good. Rundown of the donuts I tried:\\n\\n1. Blueberry Bourbon Basil: Their most popular flavor. The texture was good, but unfortunately the glaze was way too sweet for me. Also didn't get any hint of basil.\\n2. The OG: Horchata glaze! Simple and good.\\n3. Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib: A bit too sweet for my tastes, but the passion fruit flavor was good.\\n4. Maple Bacon: Loved the smoky bacon on this, but the glaze on this one was also too sweet for me. \\n5. Orange Olive Oil: Really nice delicate orange flavor.\\n6. Blueberry Cake: I really enjoyed this one. The texture and flavor were both great. \\n7. Spicy Strawberry Cake: Also liked this one, but if I had to choose, I would go with Blueberry Cake instead. Definitely tasted the spiciness.\\n8. Mexican Hot Chocolate: If you love chocolate, then I definitely recommend this one. I enjoyed the spicy kick.\\n9. Cointreau Creme Brulee: Comes with a pipette of cointreau you can squeeze into the vanilla custard inside. Not a fan of creme brulee, but this was interesting. My husband loved this.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed both their brioche and cake donuts and of course, their interesting flavors. If you're going to be traveling to Portland, then I highly recommend making a stop at Blue Star! Just be aware that if they run out of donuts, then they're out. This location apparently can sell out sometimes on weekends, but weekdays are pretty safe.

I would always hear that \\"someone was robbed at gun point\\" or that \\"people were held hostage at gun point\\" and I thought to myself, 'why do people continue to go there?'\\n\\nBon's is much like 'gun point'. Why do people continue to go there? I just don't understand.\\n\\n$3 sounds like an amazing deal for breakfast. And it is. The key word there being *breakfast*. What they serve is some sort of inedible swill that I'd feel bad giving to a dog.\\n\\nYet somehow this place is always packed. Maybe people like the idea of getting a complete colon cleanse package at discount prices - though I'm not really sure. Regardless, this is certainly one to be wary of unless you enjoy the idea of spending the next 2 hours on the crapper.\\n\\nFor specifics: The hash browns were soggy and had no flavor. The eggs were cold and over-coagulated. The toast was stale. The juice tasted somewhat of cleaning chemicals (I'm guessing this is due to the fact that the cups are so old that they are now infused with the sanitizer from the dishwasher). The entire restaurant looked like a bomb had just gone off in it. The one small glimmer of hope was the waitstaff who were extremely pleasant, though this does not make up for the fact that when I go to eat out I expect some sort of actual food.\\n\\nJust so you don't get the wrong idea I have absolutely nothing against greasy spoon type restaurants.

The Firepot of the Tom Kha soup is flavorful with mushrooms, chunks of tofu, in a coconut milk. An impressive execution (with actual fire keeping the soup nice and hot).  It would be cute to share this on a date. The Panag Curry and GangDang curry have plenty of vegetables. I've shared this with a friend, but if you are really hungry get your own!

He finally snagged one during the fireworks, and we were excited to eat here again. The three of us really talked this place up to the rest of our group, and ultimately, it didn't live up to the experience we originally had.\\n\\nFirst, if you can, request the West Wing. We sat there the first time we went and liked the more intimate feel. Also, it is quieter since it doesn't have the high ceiling of the main ballroom. We tried to get a table there again, but we were told it would be an additional 45 minute wait so we skipped it.\\n\\nOur waitress was very nice, but she seemed pretty frazzled and spread thin. I think she had several large tables, it was towards the end of her shift, and she couldn't spend the amount of time she wanted in each place. Either the general waitstaff was very clumsy or they were exhausted; we heard at least seven glasses break during our 1-1.5 hour dinner. Our waitress copped to at least one of them. The sound of breaking glass is very loud with the high ceilings so each one cut through any conversation we were having.\\n\\nThe food itself was also not as good as last time. The seafood dish has been changed from a puff pastry to a pasta, which doesn't taste as good and didn't seem as decadent as its former incarnation. My mother mentioned she hardly got any sauce on her plate of pasta. My sister's steak was very underdone so she had to send it back though she did enjoy it once she got the correct temperature.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the grey stuff *was* as delicious as I remembered it being. Everyone seemed to enjoy their desserts, and our waitress brought out special birthday and anniversary desserts for the appropriate members of our party, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nI might give this place another shot in the future, but if this is the new standard, I don't think I'll waste the time and energy trying to secure one of the elusive dinner spots."},{"name":"JoLa Cafe","address":"5915 SW Corbett Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Can we say terrible?

Subsequent positive feedback from fellow Yelpers and food cart lovers convinced me to give it another go.\\n\\nUpon my arrival last Friday morning, I noticed the hash dishes were no longer there. Instead, I had several breakfast sandwich options and \\"The Breakfast.\\" Yup, it's called \\"The Breakfast.\\" For $10, the cart operator will cook up a meal that he picked for the day. No substitutions...you take what he gives you. Apparently he only has enough to make seven portions (well, at least for when I visited).\\n\\nIntrigued by the mystery of \\"The Breakfast,\\" I went with that $10 item. I received a lamb burger, using English muffins as the bun. Two sunny-side-up eggs, two strips of bacon, a mild \\"hot sauce\\" accompanied the burger. A side of veggie hash rounded out the meal.\\n\\nThe hash was refreshing, cooked nicely. The green veggies remained vibrant. The potatoes were soft, yet held their shape (not overcooked). Perhaps a tad more seasoning would work for me there. I wonder if it woulda been OK to ask for hot sauce on the hash -- or would that break the rules of \\"The Breakfast\\"...?\\n\\nThe lamb burger was OK. I love runny eggs (over easy, sunny side up, etc.) just so I can break the yolk and let it run all over the place. Mmm...bacon (that description alone should suffice). Unfortunately, I thought the lamb patty appeared undercooked in the middle -- at least for my liking. It wasn't cold and raw, but the pinkish color and tartare-like texture left me a bit squeamish to eat the innermost areas. I like about medium-rare or medium, generally, but this looked pretty darn pink. The lamb was a bit gamy. The tangy hot sauce on the English muffin worked well, yet could have been a little more assertive.\\n\\nA better experience from last time, but again, I can't bring myself to rate it any higher than a slightly above-average visit.\\n\\nFYI, Yolk's winter hours are Thursday to Sunday, 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m."},{"name":"Splash Bar","address":"904 NW Couch St","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Splash bar is Portland's own drunk, fratty, rowdy tiki bar and I hate but love every single minute of it.\\n\\nIf you can get over the kitschy decor and vibe (and the abundance of drunk college kids) and not take yourself too seriously, you'll have a blast.\\n\\nThe music is fantastic.

Those fried wingettes were to die for and by far the best thing on the menu.  \\n\\nYou must order these, no question about it."},{"name":"Im Thai Cuisine","address":"1671 Main St, Ste C","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Went to IM Thai earlier to continue tasting their menu. Green Curry and Tom Yum soup, both were delicious. The Tom Yum in a slightly spicy lime and lemon grass broth was packed with mushrooms. Given the choice of proteins for the soup, I chose Tofu and enjoyed it very much. Then opted for chicken in the curry, also delicious. Can't wait to return and sample more of the menu."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Crema is clearly popular.  When I arrived at mid-day on a rainy Cambridge Friday, there was standing room only and the young ladies behind the counter were splitting their time between hip-looking college students and some folks from the Food Network who were apparently doing a feature on the establishment.  \\n\\nPopular eateries, especially coffeehouses, have a tendency to come off as pretentious and rude.  Lucky for me, Crema's employees were friendly and courteous even as they worked to handle a LOT of business.\\n\\nMy iced chai latte was creamy and tasty, though a bit small for the price.  And on the subject of price, I should warn you, fellow yelpers, that Crema's policy is to require a $10 minimum for the use of plastic currency.  This would have sunk my plans to pick up a quick drink as I never carry cash.  I understand that businesses pay for the privilege of accepting plastic, but turning down business seems like a fairly bad plan.  In any case, the woman behind the counter was very polite in asking me to remember their policy next time.  Fair enough and I appreciate the leniency, but next time, I'm just inclined to go elsewhere where I don't have to make an ATM trip just to get coffee."},{"name":"Rossetti Restaurant","address":"47 Sutton St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4.5","text":"Not that impressed food OK sort of genetic Italian\\nWaitress sucked but we still had a good time"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I felt like I had to write an update because Zyka has recently moved toward using paper place and bowls. An improvement, but still a lot of trash and plastic cutlery."},{"name":"Broadway Pizza Bar","address":"403 Broadway","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went to the Broadway Pizza Bar this afternoon for lunch. They had some really good lunch specials.  We both had the 10\\" personal pan pizza and a drink. That was $6.99 for each of us.  This special includes 2 toppings on the pie.  I chose to have Artichoke hearts and goat cheese.  It was an excellent pizza. They have a vast array of topings available.  \\n\\nThey don't serve only pizza though. They also have pasta dishes, sandwhiches, soups and Calzones.  \\n\\nWe sat at the horseshoe shaped bar with the three flat screen TV's on the back wall. All playing sports of course.  The bartender was very nice and the service was great.\\n\\nThis was a great choice for lunch!  We look forward to returning for dinner sometime"},{"name":"Gami Sushi","address":"10111 Number 3 Road, Suite 126","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was very prompt and polite so can't complain on the service front! The food was average at best. \\n\\nWe ordered the making tray, sashimi combo and the Gami roll. Sashimi was relatively fresh but the sushi in the making tray tastes everything but. They probably rolled a bunch early on and let it sit throughout the day."},{"name":"Umami","address":"1704 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I've always thought Asian fusion was just a fad.  I thought it would fizzle out when people realized how overpriced and mediocre most of it tends to be.  Umami's food is surprisingly inexpensive given its setting and I will grant that it's a notch above the typical mandarin orange, crispy noodle laden crap.\\n\\nThe food isn't terribly creative, but well done.  The Chilean Seabass cooked well, and  the sweet potato/miso combination is solid.  The seaweed and mixed greens salad is inexplicably addicting but the Tom Yum soup isn't all that special.\\n\\nMost of my love has to go out to the drinks.  The drink menu encompasses a wide range of flavors suitable to any alcoholic whim.  The Beaconsfield, a crisp and clean cucumber vodka drink and the Noonoroni, a negroni with hibiscus bitters, sit at opposite sides of the flavor spectrum and they are both wonderful.  There's isn't a single cocktail on the menu that I would not like to try so I will definitely be back."},{"name":"Joe's Burgers","address":"7409 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"The thinnest burger Ive ever gotten in my life, paper thin. I hate writing bad reviews, I thought i was in one of those practical joke TV shows.... sadly I was not. When the bacon is thicker than the burger, thats a problem. I expected more for this price point."},{"name":"El Azteca Mexican Restaurant","address":"1784 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We all have bad days and whiny customers, but never have I seen a waitress pour our margaritas that a few of us had already sipped on back into the pitcher to demonstrate how to get five margaritas out of it when we were only able to get three. Unsanitary and unprofessional at best. Won't be going back."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The Spiced Dark and Stormy changed my life; and not simply because it transported me to the land of tipsy. 5 spice cocktail- whodyathunkit?
