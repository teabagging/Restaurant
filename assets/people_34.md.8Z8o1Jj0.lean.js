No time in the morning to wait for the other place so I came her for dinner without a reservation. The place was packed as usual and there was multiple people waiting. Only waited 30 mins for a table on Wednesday night. That's not bad at all. This place is CASH ONLY. Some people were frustrated at the wait and cash only part but it helps if you know about it beforehand. Got to get a good look at the Pit and how they manage all the bbq. Pretty cool to see how they work together to manage it. The lot is pretty large and the eating space is big as well. It is like eating in a greenhouse since there are windows all around. Here we go:\\n\\nFood\\nI got the all you can eat BBQ. Not bad for $25. They bring you plate by plate until you are fool. I only made it to plate 2 and I'm a pretty big guy. The BBQ was really good and I enjoyed the flavor. Only issue I had was the temp of the meat. It was luke warm and I like my food hot. Maybe I should have said something to the server and she could have fixed it, something to note for next time. The brisket was tender and cooked just right. The ribs were falling off the bone and not dry. The sausage was on point for me and they give you a good amount. The sides were just ok. Nothing special but that is typical of all bbq restaurant sides. To end the experience I got the cobbler. It was really good, not too sweet and plenty of fruit. \\n\\nService\\nThe server was very nice and she managed to take good care of us. With the place being so packed I expected long delays between plates and refills but she was on it. We were done in like an hour and I took the cobbler to go.\\n\\nAll in all I enjoyed the bbq and atmosphere here. The picnic table style tables were a nice touch.

The restaurant is pretty--not pretty enough to have a full blown photoshoot (it's not THAT kind of Instagram aesthetic), but very pleasing regardless.\\n\\nOur server was very nice and accommodating, letting me know whether or not the waffles and the Paella contained any dairy. The Paella actually did, but she was able to make substitutions and I also subbed the chorizo for avocado to make it vegetarian. Unfortunately, I didn't actually quite like my dish. It was served in a skillet, but it wasn't hot: it was more or less served at room temperature, so I found the concept of the skillet a bit misleading. The flavours were just okay--maybe it's because I subbed it with avocado, but it felt sort of bland throughout. I wouldn't order this again. However, one of my friends got the Granola, Fruit & Yoghurt, and I ate some of the granola and fruit--super good! The granola really hits the spot and the fruit was fresh and sweet.\\n\\nLastly, my friends asked the server if they would be able to serve some complimentary dessert (they did so when I went to the washroom--sneaky!), and they promptly came out with a small and cute bite-sized dessert plate.

I've tried the original (Paitan), the extra spicy and the miso. I think the miso is probably the best so far. The only thing for the miso is that you need to really stir it a lot for the miso scoop to blend in and dissolve in the soup. Other than that, the noodles were good and the soup was very rich. Totto ramen is a bit different compared to the typical Japanese ramen houses back in Japan but that's because they use a different base which makes it more rich and a little more greasier.  Service was also always decent. The first time, it was a little hurried probably due to the fact that they just opened but the second and third time I went, everything was running smoothly and the waitresses were super friendly. \\n\\nAlso, cash only!

Outside you can watch people as they make their way through Downtown Disney.\\n\\nAs an appetizer I got the cream of mushroom soup and it was pretty good. It was my first time trying it so I don't have much to compare it to, but I was satisfied with it when I was done. As my meal I got the shepard's pie with a twist. The twist on Raglan's shepard's pie is that the meat they use is a combination of beef and lamb. Honestly, I couldn't taste a difference, but I thought the pie was great. It was a hearty meal and they give you a large portion of it, so you get your money's worth. I thought the pie was great and wouldn't say no to getting it again. My companion got the fada burger which was great too. I had a bite of it and thought it was delicious.\\n\\nOverall, I am happy with my first experience at Raglan Road and I can't wait to head back for some more shepard's pie and this time for some Irish beer too."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I came here for Craigie's version of Dine Out Boston on a Thursday night.

I for one definitely consider it more of a sushi spot and can't remember ever ordering a Thai entree on any of my many past visits, but having eaten at Surin, I'd guess the Thai menu is also very legit. \\n\\nThough it appears small, there is plenty of seating. The dining space weaves back from the street to the back patio, overlooking a parking lot and the former Illegal Foods space. It's divided into two separate rooms, plus a large patio. Reservations are not required but of course, couldn't hurt. (Note: they do no accept OpenTable.) \\n\\nThe sushi portion of the menu is extensive and decently customizable as everything is made to order. There are two separate sushi boat options on the menu. Called the \\"Love Boat\\" either way, you can order a $45 boat or a $65 boat of similar size, but with some different offerings. \\n\\nWe *WAY* over-did it on a recent visit, and ordered the following:\\nAPPETIZERS\\n- Satay Chicken ($7; sliced lean fillets marinated in Harry's Thai spices, skewered and chargrilled, served with peanut sauce and crisp cucumber salad)\\n- Shrimp Tempura ($9; battered jump shrimp and battered fresh vegetables, deep fried and served with sweet and sour sauce)\\n\\nNIGIRI\\n- Unagi ($2 per piece; fresh water eel)\\n\\n\\"SPECIAL SET\\"\\n- Harry's Special: ($6.50 for two pieces; baked scallop with masago nigiri)\\n\\n\\"LOVE BOAT\\"\\n- $45 boat, includes a cup of soup for each of us, 4 pieces salmon nigiri, 4 pieces Tuna nigiri, 6 piece California Roll, 6 piece Rock and Roll, 6-8 piece Volcano Roll, 6-8 piece Super Crunch Roll\\n\\nOverall, sushi quality is very high and presentation is lovely.

Totto Ramen's ramen soup is chicken-based, as opposed to pork, and the difference is noticeable. The broth is fresher and cleaner, but certainly does not lack in flavor. The grilled char siu (2 pieces) is fatty and delicious. I opted to fork over an extra couple of bucks for more char siu. The additional ball of ground pork that came with my miso ramen was confusing -- it tasted sour, but was much more pleasant to eat after it had time to stew in the broth. \\n\\nFor my miso ramen, the noodles were the round thick ones. For my boyfriend's spicy ramen, his were flatter and cooked through more. Not sure why there's a difference, but it may be worth asking your waiter/waitress if you prefer a certain type of noodle!\\n\\nOverall, Totto Ramen is a solid option. I don't think I'd wait more than 30 minutes for it. There are usually crowds outside of it on the weekends -- if there are, I'd walked down the block to Super 88 and try out Pikaichi instead."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great food.

I was hoping for a soft, juicy bun. But instead, I got the glossy texture of a dry bun. Hmmm, not what I have experienced. After a few bites, I was able to get some flavor, but simply, there was too much bun and not enough filling. Taste did not travel well, and there was something off.\\n\\nIt must be said that I almost ordered every bun on my first visit. They all suffered from the same problem, they were a bit dry. As I remember, the best buns are the ones that are soaked in sauce or dressed up copiously. The buns at King Bao were very timid in that department, very dry. I understand that it may not be visually appealing, but these were a bit sterile. I did like the flavors though. The chicken, the fish, the tofu, the veggies and the shrimp (specially the shrimp) were very well flavored. There just wasn't enough sauce or dressing to turn these buns into miniature climaxes. \\n\\nTo help the dryness, I used plenty of Sriracha and it did help, but I would have liked King Bao more if the Sriracha wasn't necessary.\\n\\nThen again, these little buns rock.

After that ordeal, I was definitely ready for a drink.  I had a vodka mixed cocktail that was really good but it went down way too easily, and I had to switch to wine.  We started with the mussels.  Now their mussels are different, with the sauce not being as creamy but still full of flavor.  Add grilled bread, a suggestion by the manager, and that was a genius thought.  It really took everything to the next level.  GET the grilled bread. Next we had some type of fish with a salsa verde type sauce.  It was really tasty, and had a nice charr on top.  Next we had this interesting grilled spring onion with a romesco sauce.  I love romesco which typically contains nuts in it.  I think it was pine nuts, which are sweet and delicious.   Then we had the hanger steak.  I don't eat it, but he said it was really good.  The charred sugar peas dish was truly good as well.  I love anything grilled/charred.  Lastly, we had the champinones with garlic and scallions.  They were really good, and one of my favorites of the night.  We finished with a birthday flourless cake with a coffee type icing.  I really liked it, and I don't even drink coffee.  It was also super moist and not overly filling.   \\n\\nAll in all, a terrific experience, and look forward to going back.

I walked into this location at 8:05 am this morning. I felt like a biscuit and this was closest to my work. There were absolutely no customers in the resturant. I walked up to the counter. There were no workers at the register. There was one worker sweeping the floor. This was the only person i could see. Over the span of 3 minutes (felt like 30), this worker looked at me twice did/said nothing and went back to sweeping. At this time i actually spoke out and asked if anyone was there...about 30 seconds later, the manager (or At least i am guessing she was), came up to the front registers with a armload of supplies. She said \\"I'll be with you in a minute\\" she said. I paused, then i turned around and walked out. \\nThis \\"service\\" was unacceptable in my opinion. First of all it was 8 am. All the supplies should have been stocked. Secondly, in my experience working in fast food/ customer service, when you see a patron needing assistance, you put down what you are doing and help them, not ignore them.\\nI will not be returning to this location.

It's a cute spot on a cute street but the food was mediocre and riddled with prep errors. What really wowed us though, and not in a good way, was the privileged Millennial attitude from the entire serving staff, who took turns either not giving a care that we didn't like our food: \\"This noodle bowl is way too sweet for me.\\" \\"Really? I think it's perfect!\\" ...then she walks away, meaning 'too bad for you sukka!' Even though we ordered it because it was her recommendation. Or the Hot or Not plates of fries (they came out ice cold and had to be replaced), or the mint lemonade that our friend found flavourless, which the food runner kept insisting \\"it was a steeped mix, made using a tea bag,\\" instead of understanding that you should maybe just fix the problem when you serve flavourless food instead of staring silently into our friend's eyes until finally she had to ask clearly and firmly to have it removed and replaced. All this in itself was proving a bit hilarious (in a really-not-good way) until the real highlight of the meal, when I asked for the guacamole which was clearing missing from my very boring taco salad, and was met with surprise and incredulity. I was actually forced to go back up to the front to find a menu to prove it was listed on the dish because the woman announced they 'don't have avocado' and spun away, leaving us three exchanging looks until our eyes dropped down in unison to our friend's burger where avocado lay listlessly between the buns. Luckily that Mac and Cheez burger was decently tasty, as were the yummy finally-hot fries, so the whole lunch wasn't a bust.

One pizza is enough for 3 hungry people.\\n\\nIf you take a little trip to the pizza making station, there's an area with some toppings, such as crushed garlic, parm cheese, crushed red pepper, chilis, etc. Your kids can get some pizza dough to play with while waiting for your pizza to come, too.\\n\\nThink you don't have to eat pizza in Atlanta?

They also have a combo meal of spicy marinated momo with a drink for $11.99.\\n\\nThe owner makes each order fresh by hand, so it's understandable there's a bit of a wait, around 15-20 minutes for each order, sometimes longer if it's busy. \\n\\nI ordered a nepali tea (nice and hot and similar to chai but without the spices), chicken momos (like shanghai buns minus the soup) and bara with alu dum (lentil pancake with stewed potatoes).\\n\\nWhile I enjoyed all the items, my favourite was the bara with aalu dum.  The texture was similar to latkes. \\n\\nThe owner is very chatty and he told me that he's not doing any advertising as he can't provide more menu items (like more desserts) until his family immigrates from Australia, hopefully next year.\\n\\nI think he provides the most varied momo menu I've ever seen."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I am VERY glad I decided to go to Raglan Road during my first night at Disney.

The \\"Nantucket Lobster Roll\\" was neither fresh, nor was it real lobster.  For $14.95 this is a crime, at this price I expect to get REAL lobster.  No where on the menu does it indicate that imitation lobster is used, and even that wasn't fresh.  Some extra cajun seasoning was mixed in to mask the lack of freshness.  The photo used on the menu shows real lobster.  I have been to Nantucket and I am originally from Massachusetts.  I have had many lobster rolls.  Charging 14.95 makes it even worse.  On a better note, the fried oysters were delicious.  I have read a number of good reviews for this place, so it is safe to say you can order most anything from their menu except for the lobster roll.  Because my order was take out, there wasn't much that I could do about it.  If I had dined in, then I would sent it back and ordered something else.  Not cool, Nantucket Shrimp Shack, not cool.\\n\\nAddendum to my review.  I originally gave this review two stars, but after the owners response, I reduced it to 1 star.  The owner basically said that my review was disappointing and proceeded to defend the quality of his products and price appropriateness.  He never addressed the fact that the so called lobster roll is made with imitation (surimi) lobster yet it is priced as much as other restaurants serving the real thing.  Neither was a genuine apology offered.  Whose disappointment is of the greatest importance, the customer or the business owner.  I was going to give this place a second chance, but now I think I'll just steer clear.  The response that I received from the business owner demonstrates a total disregard for the customer.

The bartender was a big scattered but she did just fine. A bit quiet, not much of a personality but I got the vibe that's pretty much all the servers here. \\n\\nTo get started I had a pur√©ed cantallini bean soup with tybee island shrimp and truffle oil. It was excellent. Probably the strangest and most interesting soup combination I've had recently. Bruschetta was good. Arugula salad with shaved parmesan needed a touch of something. Perhaps a vinaigrette? Boyfriend played it safe and asked for oil and balsamic once he realized it wasn't dressed. \\n\\nI ordered the Sea Bass, and my honey got the chicken plate. \\n\\nHis was absolutely perfect, mix of light and dark meat-killer broth, amazing potato chunks. My sea bass was very light, unseasoned. Almost unpleasant. Delicate and a very large piece of fish.. It was almost too perfectly cooked, I prefer fish to be just slightly overdone so the inside isn't mushy or too slick on my palate. \\n\\nAlso due to the menu being difficult to read I didn't realize it wasn't over pasta, instead over green beans. Which were good, but I was expecting something else. \\n\\nWe ordered a side of the white truffle pasta. Huge portion, very flavorful and rich. I commented on how oily and buttery it was, tasty but so so buttery-I learned that's the coveted truffle oil. Perhaps it's simply not my thing but I do 'get' the hype. \\n\\nMy favorite thing was probably Veal Ossobuco. Absolutely delicious, thick chunks of veal falling off the bone great texture, salty and rich, filling and bursting with complexity. \\n\\nI enjoyed two glasses of $9 wine I can purchase at any wine shop, I had no idea I would ever enjoy a Candoni merlot. Merlot is yuck but this particular bottle was delish. \\n\\nPanna Cotta is this spots claim to fame. Absolutely divine! It's like soft air that melts to a sweet cream in your mouth!

The chef seemed to be unclear on what was printed on the menu. For starters, many of the ladies in our group ordered the short rib bowl (which on the menu, comes with a poached egg). The chef made a few bowls with scrambled eggs instead. When the ladies sent those back, the chef sent the server back to our table to ask if anyone would just eat these scrambled egg bowls instead (basically the chef said \\"I messed up, but don't want to redo these so do you all just want to eat it?\\") that did not go over well (people who like poached eggs like a poached egg...and that's what was printed on the menu). Then another lady ordered shrimp and grits that, per the menu, was supposed to come with a cream based sauce. When the food arrived at the table the sauce had been subbed for salsa instead. The manager rectified both of these situations, but it's clear the chef was in the back ad libbing and making dishes any way that he wanted versus what was printed on the menu. Other ladies simply commented that their food was \\"ok,\\" it did not seem anyone was too thrilled about their selections.\\n\\nI think this place would be perfect to get drinks on a Friday or Saturday night, but as far as brunch is concerned, I can't say the food will draw me in to come in again for that."},{"name":"Alborz Persian Cuisine","address":"3300 W Anderson Ln, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"You know I just hate buffets.

Everyone paid their meal and the waiter tried placing the supposedly missed unpaid items onto our bill as some of the guest had already left. The waiter then redone the bill and came to us to pay.  \\n\\nThe chip on my card provided an error message as the chip did not work. I advised that he could do the three attempts to chip and then it should allow you to slide the card on the machine. The waiter gave a slick comment \\"and pray\\". To me it wasn't funny at all. All said in done he returned stating that the card did not work. I had asked my friend to pay as I transferred the money to her. I found that the waiter had actually charged my card twice for different amounts and he charged my friends card. Ridiculous!!! Now instead of paying $128.60 for my food I ended up paying close to $400.00 that night. \\n\\nI spoke with the manager and he advised that he shouldn't go through with the reconciliation that they would do that night. Sad thing is this morning I'm forced to call the bank and explain what happened last to avoid the duplicate charges. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the waiter that I had last night I would have scored this high but this guy didn't know what he was doing at all. The tip that I provided was actually for the other guy who cleaned my table and provided clean utensils for me to actually join my friends for dinner.

On this evening, we ordered the following:\\n\\nSweet Potato Samosas ($8.75)\\nSalt and vinegar popcorn ($4.5)\\nSriracha Chili wings ($8.25)\\n12 hr Brisket Sandwich ($14.50)\\norganic Arugula Salad (Comped)\\n\\nThe Salt and Vinegare popcorn came out first, and man, do NOT buy these if you don't like salt and/or vinegar, because they were strong!  I enjoyed the flavor of these, but every so often you'd get a piece of popcorn that seemed infused with salt/vinegar, which would clear my sinuses right out.  Between the two of us, we didn't finish it.\\n\\nThe Sweet potato samosas were almost too pretty to eat.  They were these fried bags of sweet potato goodness, with a flavor combination i'd never had before.  I really loved them, even the crispy flared out tops, that were deliciously fried.  The samosas were resting on a cranberry sauce, that added just enough sweet to the savory flavor of the samosas, and this was a winning dish for me!\\n\\nI didn't try the Sriracha Chili wings, but I was told they were messy, and okay.  They came in a serving of 6, and also came with sliced mango, rose petals and cilantro in a nice little bowl.\\n\\nThe 12 hr Brisket Sandwich also came with belgian fries.  I was kinda expecting more of a bbq styled entree, although as my date pointed out, they never mentioned anything about smoked brisket on the menu.  With that said, I got a meal that I wasn't expecting in terms of flavor, so let that be a lesson to all bbq brisket lovers.  \\n\\nSo what flavors did I get with the brisket?  It was very reminiscent of thanksgiving, what with the brown gravy, the cranberry sauce, and it just so happening to be november when we paid a visit here.  \\n\\nBad meal?  \\n\\nAbsolutely not.  The meat was cooked well, was a large hunk of meat, and the \\"sandwich\\" saw a slice of bread being rested on by the brisket, but also soaking in all of the cranberry and gravy.  Excellent thanksgiving dish.  Again, just not what I was expecting, but that's okay!\\n\\nThe Belgian fries were another matter.  Limp, under seasoned, and I truly wish they had a little more crunch to them.  These came as a side and not a starter though, so I wouldn't have been as forgiving if I had to pay an individual price for them.\\n\\nThe Organic Arugula salad was ordered by my date, who soon found a small bug in the salad.  Staff apologized, offered another salad, and ultimately comped the salad.  Truly it's the customer service that gets the Porter their 4th star.  Service was great, attentive, checking in often just to see how things were, topping off our water, and they even gave us a 10% \\"good customer\\" price reduction on our bill.  How cool is that?\\n\\nParking for the porter is shared in the form of a parking lot to the rear of the Porter, but don't expect it to be available on weekends or friday nights.  \\n\\nOverall, there were some fantastic dishes...there were some \\"eh\\" dishes, but with great customer service, I certainly will at least give these guys another shot.

Both the atmosphere indoors and outdoors were classy and casual.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu is very reasonable for Boston at $10-$12 a drink and the spicy negroni and gin cocktail were strong and tasty. The menu literally has something for everyone and we decided on a 4 cheese pizza, a fried zucchini appetizer and an arugula salad. Thick, chewy, delicious bread and olive oil quickly arrived along with the fresh salad. And then things went downhill...\\n\\nQuite frankly we had the worst server that I can remember ever having, anywhere. Let's call her The Italian, because she had a thick accent and may not have fully understood English. She completed the usual checklist of poor service, such as leaving us unattended for 20 minute stretches at a time, forgetting to bring silverware and not even introducing herself. But 45 minutes after we ordered food she came and asked us to remind her what the order was again. I never ask to see a manager, but this pushed me over the edge.\\n\\nThe general manager Nicholas Garoufalis was the nicest, most understanding and honest GM I've ever met. I wish he would open a restaurant in Portland. He explained the story of how he used to own nightclubs in Boston and his dream was to open this restaurant. It took almost a year of wading through city hall and construction to get Mast' open last fall. Hiring servers is much harder than it seems. Even with hundreds of applications and dozens of interviews, some hires don't come as advertised. Nicholas comped our entire dinner (must have been $75) and brought us another free round of drinks. To say this goes above and beyond is a massive understatement. I was just hungry for our pizza.\\n\\nThe pizza and zucchini then came and both were delicious. I was expecting a personal size pizza but this was easily enough to share. Mast' is the ideal compromise of upscale food and atmosphere with reasonable prices.

The biscuit was overdone (deep brown on top) and tough, and it was already cut in half and toasted when I got my food which I wasn't a fan of. The breakfast potatoes were well-seasoned, but so greasy that at the bottom of the bowl they sat in a pool of grease. I couldn't finish them because of the oil, it was making me nauseous.

By this point we were starving and irritated. We dove into the chicken only to find it still raw and bloody. It was disgusting. Fortunately, the MOD was apologetic and comped our meal.

You can make your own, but I decided to go with the mission bowl. They have a wide selection of bowls which you can choose the base for, and I decided to do 1/2 arugula and 1/2 marinated kale. I loved it, it tasted like such a better version of a salad since it was packed with eggplant (amazing!), edamame, and topped with a (I think) tahini sauce. The portion is VERY filling- my friend got a rice bowl and had a bit left over. They make home crafted kombucha which was impressive, as well as matcha lemonade and horchata cold brew.

The way I understand it, Lola doesn't actually open the restaurant until 5pm on Saturdays now, but she opened for lunch especially for us because we were bringing in so much business, and insert-your-favorite-supreme-being-here knows she needs all the biz she can get.\\n\\nFrankly, I don't think the event was planned all that well.  I love the Meetup organizer who put this thing together, but trying to fit close to sixty people at once in a room the size of my thumb was a Cajun nightmare.  It was like Bourbon Street on Fat Tuesday (today!), without the street.  Sure, the Meetup organizer expected people to come at various times because people are sometimes late, but the turnaround between people leaving and other people arriving did not flow very well.\\n\\nI, luckily, got there a half hour early.  This wasn't because I normally show up everywhere early (I do), but because I misread the meetup details and thought it said to show up at 11am instead of 11:30.  But once the mosh pit started forming in that tiny room, I was glad I'd misread the details.\\n\\nAlso, our group had a specific menu made up for us.  Had I known this ahead of time, I likely would have chosen to try Lola's fare another day instead.  I was very much hoping to try a shrimp po' boy, but that wasn't on our menu.  What WAS on the menu was fried chicken, gumbo, or crawfish ettoufee.  We had our choice of two sides:  mac 'n' cheese, yams, collard greens, and rice 'n' beans.  I chose fried chicken with mac/cheese and rice/beans.\\n\\nThe food was good but not excellent.  The chicken was breaded in panko crumbs with some nice spice added, and the beans and rice had other great spices in it.  The mac and cheese was nice and creamy.  I definitely didn't feel like I wasted my time driving out there, but I did feel that the price was a bit high.  I paid nearly $11 for my meal.  I would have been comfortable paying maybe $8 for it.  After all, Lola's ain't Gumbo's.  I did, however, get four wings/legs, some cornbread, and some of Lola's delicious Cajun iced tea.  I had actually ordered regular iced tea, but the Cajun was so good I kept it.  It's sugary, though, so watch out.\\n\\nThe meal was quite messy.  I'm glad we had an abundance of napkins on the lazy susan.  I paid in cash and gave a couple of extra bucks to the *cause*.  Lola and her daughter are very sweet individuals.  They were genuinely hospitable.\\n\\nOthers have stated there is a long wait for food, but there wasn't in our case.  I suppose Lola was simply prepared because she knew we were coming, but I think I only waited about ten minutes for my food.  As far as cleanliness, the floor and walls seemed like they could use a heavy spring cleaning, but the tables and place mats were fine... until we got there.\\n\\nI tried to check out their website again just now to verify their hours, but it appears to be down.  As in, they need to pay godaddy.com before they lose it forever.  I hope this doesn't mean they're on the verge of closing, because I would still like to check out one of Lola's shrimp po' boys.\\n\\nOff note, why is it that my lazy ass never writes reviews on the weekends?  Nevermind, I think I just answered my own question.  Although, I suppose it was right to save this one until Fat Tuesday.\\n\\nMardi Gras heureux!

When is it not busy?\\nThis location is always packing at dinner time and the food is reasonably consistent, but I keep finding things that are a bit disconcerting for me and that is the overall price VS serving portions on some dishes.\\nOne of my favourite dishes here is the spaghetti and meatballs.  Especially post Op, I've kinda lost my appetite for food, and yet, I can still enjoy this dish.  The problem is that it is getting smaller and smaller and the price although still ok, is pricey for what I get.  I don't want to be cheap here, but pasta is one of the cheapest meals to cook in a restaurant and has one of the highest profit margins for food dishes served.  This is something all us cooks and culinary followers know. Pasta is cheap, so why not put more on the plate?\\n\\nAnyways, we did take out and that just made it worse.

I'm reluctant to go back because I feel like the offered specials were unfairly overpriced and definitely recommend asking the price of the specials before ordering."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I'm glad we found the salty pig.

I've been to the Hollywood one many times so I knew what to expect. If it weren't for Diagon Alley we probably would have skipped this park during our Orlando trip. We decided to go to Universal for a few hours before our departing flight. I'm sooooo glad we didn't opt for a full day and swap it with a Disney Park. We went on a weekday so the lines were short and the most we waited was maybe 15 minutes. We probably circled the park 3 times to get our money's worth hoping we'd find something cool to do or check out. There isn't a lot of shade when you're walking around so don't be surprised if you're ducking into a store every ten minutes or so to escape the heat. I think the only time I was excited was when we went on the ET ride. The Hollywood park no longer has that attraction so it was a good throw back. Seriously save yourself time AND money and avoid this park. If you must go to Diagon Alley get the park hopper so you can spend your time at Islands of Adventure and go on rides."},{"name":"The Samosa House","address":"109-12837 88th Avenue","city":"Surrey","stars":"4.5","text":"I came here based on Google reviews and I saw everything true about this small restaurant, friendly staff, beautiful interior design and everything so clean. \\n\\nI tried to order from all of them, I loved butter chicken and bbq chicken more than others. \\n\\nJust for the Mussula one, I couldn't eat that because it was so so spicy and hot!

But I refuse to give them any business because of the way they handle themselves on the weekends. They let way too many people into the building, I have no idea how it isn't against fire code. The bartenders are always under staffed, so it takes around 20 minutes just to get a drink. And if you're trying to eat later in the evening? You might as well just not. On multiple occasions I've had to remind my server more than once that I ordered food. The bartenders are so overwhelmed that they become rude, I've been given the wrong drink multiple times. It's too stressful, not worth it in my opinion.\\n*I would like to make it known that I don't believe this to be completely a server/bartender issue, this is a management issue. I know a few people who have worked there in the past and tell me horror stories about the management. Ezekiel Elliott was there for the spring game in 2017 and I know for a fact that he did not tip the server that he had running everywhere, and the managers wouldn't add Auto-Gratuity to his bill.\\nYeah I'll take my business elsewhere, I've had too many bad experiences."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So I've heard nothing but great things about this place but I'm sad to say that it was a very underwhelming experience for all 6 of us. It was a birthday dinner celebration for one of my best friends and we were all very excited to spend it here and have a great time. It's important to note that this was on a Tuesday night.\\n\\nThe service started out good but it quickly deteriorated when we ordered two $30 pitchers of sangria but the server took away our wine glasses and replaced them with dirty, scratchy water cups because they were \\"running low on wine glasses.\\" That's never happened to me at a restaurant before. If you don't have enough wine glasses, don't serve wine. Regardless, we let that go. They brought starter bread for us about 30 minutes after we sat down and a little thing of olive oil. Mind you, we were 6 people but the bread was enough for 3 of us. So, I kindly asked for another basket and olive oil. 20 minutes later, we got the extra bread but they forgot the olive oil so I asked twice until they brought it in another 20 minutes. So we were there for about an hour and half before our food came out. Did I mention we had a reservation?\\n\\nThe food was pretty good. I ordered the empanadas and they were deliciously spicy but tiny (I guess tapas just keep getting smaller). The calamari that my friend ordered was good too, with a nice portion size. The mussels, however, were the most tasteless mussels ever. My friend could not even finish them so she hesitantly asked if she could send it back and just get the calamari. Our server kindly obliged. \\n\\nWe asked if they do anything for birthdays and she said either a dessert or wine pour-over on the house. The birthday girl chose the porr√≥n (wine pour straight into mouth) so James, the bartender, came over and did it for all 6 of us! James was very nice and the best! Gave an extra star just for him!\\n\\nWhen it came time to getting our checks, we realized that they charged us all for the bday celebration wine pour not once but twice (when it should have been on the house). Additionally, they charged my friend for both the mussels and the calamari when she sent her original order back. It took them 20 minutes to come back around to us to ask for the checks (I sensed they knew what they were doing but didn't think we'd catch it since we were \\"younger\\"). We let them know of the problems and she said it was a mistake and they'll fix it. Another 20 minutes before we received our final checks (now with comment cards lol). I'm still not sure if they messed up our checks by accident or because they thought we wouldn't double check them before we pay.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we left not wanting to ever go back."},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Searching for good Italian food in the north end is extremely difficult as a visitor to Boston.

Because there are so many undeserving 5 stars which don't paint the real picture of this establishment nor it's food and, 2. Because post-dining here we realized its health inspection grade is \\"B\\"! Feel free to look it up and make your own judgments about whether you should dine at a restaurant graded as such. I'll just tell you why it doesn't work for me.\\n\\nThe fact that they don't serve free/tap water is unfathomable. And before you say they do, they don't! That is a GD handashing sink and as per health codes (I've worked in restaurants, I know this) you can't use hand washing sinks for anything other than washing your hands. This includes using it to fill your cups with water, which is disgusting by the way.\\n\\nLet's get into pricing. For 2 pizzas and a coke, we paid nearly $60. That's nearly fine dining pricing without all of the charms (such as excellent service, atmosphere, etc) or flavors that one can expect from a pricier establishment. \\n\\nAs for the actual pizza, yes you can order and receive your pizza fast, faster than any other pizza place but there's a reason that's the case. They only have about 5 pizzas so they can pre-make a lot of them and then have it ready when you order. So when we got our pizzas they were lukewarm. I had some of the margherita pizza, the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. Also, the bottom of the crust was kind of soggy. \\n\\nNot baby friendly. We have a one year old and with how crowded it was there was no way we could get the stroller through. Not sure if they had high chairs available, but even if they did, the floor is so uneven (in some parts) that it would have been unsafe for a wily child to be in a seat on their own. So we were forced to sit in stools with no back, on a floor with a steep gradation, holding our baby in one arm and eating soggy pizza in the other.\\n\\nIf your a hipster or like \\"trendy\\" places or things because other people say they're the best, then you'll probably like this place. If you've actually had good food then you'll realize this place is nothing special and you're overpaying for such a lackluster experience."},{"name":"Bamboo Sushi","address":"836 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Bamboo Sushi is the best sushi around.

Prices for beer/wine/cocktails were shockingly reasonable. Service was decent even though it was busy night prior to a big concert. I was livid however-the toilets got backed up in the ladies room, and I was told to leave the venue and go to the single bathroom that was at the box office. I understand these things happen-but there should be a reasonable backup option for such a large space. The Moda center wouldn't let me enter until it was time for the concert to start (reasonable) and after I enter I would have to remain inside the building prior to the concert. Totally reasonable. However, it is completely unreasonable of this restaurant not to have a decent back up option for toilets especially considering the size of the venue and where it's located. I had to wait 20 minutes just to use the bathroom. And while the food was alright and the drinks were good I was sorely disappointed in the restaurant not dealing with the issue of the backed up toilets in the ladies room for a very busy evening.

I spend a good amount of time in the North End, and I can't even fill one hand with the number of times when I've seen this place without a ginormous line.  Me and lines don't go well together.\\n2) I was told it was pricey.  Sometimes, I can be a real tightwad.  And I know of plenty of other very affordable places in the neighborhood without the dreaded line.\\n3) I was told it was extremely seafood heavy.  Me?  I'm 1/2 italian (my mom's side) and in all my years growing up, seafood and italian dishes didn't go together. Italian dishes meant pasta e fagiole and just pasta, period.  Plus, I can't eat shellfish.  I'd like to, really, but I just can't.  I'm a texture girl.\\n\\nFast forward entirely too much time to when I actually planted my ass in Giacomo's line to wait for a table.  Got seated after about 20 minutes, and as I reviewed the menu, thinking that I was going to be that annoying customer who makes modifications to every single piece of the meal, I was overjoyed.  Sure, there's a lot of seafood, but there's a helluva lot of other stuff too.  Not to mention the specials.\\n\\nI ended up going with one of said specials.  And I beg, PLEAD for Giacomo's to put this dish on the menu as a regular item.  Roasted red pepper and goat cheese gnocchi with chicken, baby spinach and mushrooms in a slightly spicy sauce.  I got mine sans 'shrooms. And when I took the first bite, I nearly died and went to heaven.  But not before I inhaled the $15.95 bottle of cabernet sauvignon.  Seriously, $15.95?!!  Anyone who eats here and does not order a bottle of wine should be hung.\\n\\n1) I will gladly take out my rarely seen patience hat and wait in line again.  And again.

This place is typical Seaport. High-ceilings, loud, lively ambiance, good-looking people wanting to see and be seen. That's not to detract from the food but just expect this type of experience when you come here. Don't expect to get seated right away either, this place gets busy. We had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation.\\n\\nFOOD: I've said it before and I'll say it again. I love the small menu that this place has. It's both diverse and shows that they focus on a few good things. We ordered a lot so I will break it down into what we would order again and what we wouldn't.\\n\\nWhat I would get again (you can tell it was a good meal by the majority of items being in this category):\\n\\nTuna Crudo - Do yourself a favor and just get this. It's one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. The fish melts in your mouth and whatever it sits on top of is delicious.\\n\\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts - some of the best-fried brussels sprouts I've ever had. I feel like these are \\"in\\" right now and Row 34 does them so well.\\n\\nCrab Cake - my friend who is a self-proclaimed crab cake connaisseur said this is one of the best ones he's ever had.\\n\\nCroquettes - I typically don't like croquettes but these Salt-Pollock croquettes were delicious, just the right balance of fish and everything else.\\n\\nLobster Rolls - ok these probably are not worth $34 for the amount of lobster you get on them but they are still good. The buttered and toasted rolls they come on are delicious and the lobster is obviously fresh.

I was visiting family in Austin and they told me I had to eat BBQ at Salt Lick before I leave. I made it there and was impressed as you could smell the hickory smoke from a distance outside and walking in you can see some of the meat grilling on an open fire. It looked amazing. We ordered beef ribs, bison ribs, beef brisket and turkey for dinner followed by peach and blackberry cobbler for dessert.  First off, I never clean a bone off eating ribs, but this place had the best ribs I've ever had and I cleaned off that bone! The smokiness and seasoned rub they apply give it a taste like no other. The bison ribs were good, more seasoned but had a gamier taste, so I preferred the beef ribs overall. The beef brisket was able to be ordered lean or moist (more fatty). Both were exceptional and when combined with their own BBQ sauce, it was meat heaven. The potato salad was unique, served warm and tasted great as well. We finished it off with the cobbler and it will not disappoint. Great dining experience especially for larger parties.

We went while on a birthday trip in Texas. I've heard about this place and we didn't go at the best time, but it was still an awesome experience. Let me preface and say we spent an hour in line at Franklin BBQ before calling it quits and heading to Salt Lick. It was about a 30 minute drive to Driftwood. It is in the middle of nowhere, but it's awesome. As soon as you walk in, you can see the fire pit with all the meats. Yum! Smells great and it feels great too with it being cold in February. There was ample seating, something we didn't have to worry about compared to Franklin BBQ. As soon as we were seated we were warmly greeted by our server. She was really sweet and helpful regarding all our questions. We saw the option of the family style BBQ which is I think an all-you-can-eat type option, but we realized that you get way too much food already so we went with a cheaper option and ordered a bunch of different meats and sides. The sides weren't that great to us. We could have done without them. If you do order sides, I would recommend the smallest size. All the meats there were amazing! We got sausage, ribs, burned ends brisket, chicken, pulled pork. Everything was amazing. The meat had the smoke ring on it. Yes! Apparently in the spring and summer the vineyards here get really pretty and they have wine tastings. Highly recommended! I enjoyed Franklin BBQ the best and the sides weren't that great, but the BBQ was still amazing.\\n\\nIt was really sweet they brought me a birthday surprise dessert too. It was amazing.

IT'S HUGE! I'm pretty sure there's like, 4 or 5 giant community dining style rooms with picnic benches all over and lots and lots of hungry people. They must serve thousands every day! \\n\\nWe each ordered the combo plate - brisket and ribs. After reading reviews and speaking to some locals, I learned that the burnt tips and the fatty brisket is the way to go. Order lean and you might be a little disappointed!\\n\\nOur food came out within about 10 minutes, which was fantastic! Two giant pork ribs, a bunch of slices of brisket, some burnt tips, beans, potato salad (reminds me of German potato salad bc it's more like mashed potatoes but STILL DELICIOUS) and coleslaw with some sides of onion pickles and fresh baked bread. \\n\\nTHOSE RIBS WERE INCREDIBLE. The absolute best ribs I've ever had in my entire life, hands down. Juicy, moist, flavorful and so tender. I couldn't believe how much meat was on the bone! So good. Next time, I'll probably just stick with the ribs because I realized that I'm not the biggest fan of brisket. My girlfriend loved it, and I liked it too, but it's just not my thing. \\n\\nOh, and BYOB! As much as you like, apparently, another plus! This is a great place for big groups of friends looking to pig out and drink whatever beer or wine or spirits you please!\\n\\nOh, how could I forget?

I hated changing them on floors.\\nSo now onto the important part. The food! Our party of four pretty much ordered the entire menu. The beef tartare was seasoned perfectly. It paired wonderfully with the chips for the perfect experience of texture & taste. It was my favourite dish of the night. I also really enjoyed the mussels & clams. Good thing there was bread to soak up the amazing tomato & sausage sauce.\\nFor our main dishes, we loved the truffle pappardelle. It was the perfect carb to accompany the duck and ribeye steak. Both meat dishes came out medium rare, just the way they should be. The sablefish was flakey and delicate.

We ordered the pimento cheese fritters which were delicious but were only three ping pong ball sized fritters and at $10 that was extremely overpriced. Second, there were no specials, such as game day buckets/pitchers or app/wing specials. As a sports bar I think patrons will expect these types of menu deals for games. I understand their desire to be a little more \\"upscale\\" than your traditional sports bar, but I think for it to be a place where people regularly go to catch their favorite team, they'll have to work on their prices and menu a bit.

Had they more TV's in the booth area so people could sit up there and watch, this place would easily merit another star. \\n\\nThe service is super friendly and generally on point. The tenders have a huge and well-stocked bar to manage, and from the look of the liquor selection, someone is trying to do something high-end. This is down-side number 2. I love high end liquors and cocktails (like Lillet, Frenet, and other funky stuff), but don't deny what you are. I heard them say that they were taking Jaeger out of the selection, which made me laugh. Blitz Ladd is definitely a Jaeger-style place, no matter who wants to deny it. It's a sports bar. The funniest thing I heard is that they replaced PBR with Old Style. I should give them 5-stars just for that. And ok, I admit, what I am talking smack about may actually work out in the end for me. If removing Jaeger gets rid of a good portion of this crowd (see below), they may be on to something. Fine, fine, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\nAs the nigh progressed beyond happy hour and moved towards the nightlife/later-sports-bar crowd, I began to notice a distinct shift in clientele. This is down-side number 3. Are they busing in d-bags from Lake O? Do this many aggro sports/preppie dudes live in inner-SE? Where did these people all come from? The vibe was less \\"SE chill\\" and more \\"testosterone/aggro.\\" They dress like they should be in the pearl or near some college campus (even the campus bars around here are not like this). I was expecting an inner-SE kind of crowd, and that's not what I saw. If I wanted to go to a sports bar filled with these types of people (but in their 40's), I would have headed to On Deck. \\n\\nThe beer prices were good, the staff friendly, the place clean, and the food was decent and inexpensive. I would call this a great place to watch a game, but only so if you get there early enough to grab a spot at the bar or a table in the back near the TV's back there. I thought this was going to be my new go-to spot for a beer and a game of pool, but again, when I saw the crowd, I was seriously turned off. \\n\\nSo that just left me all confused. I was immediately impressed by the place, then confused by the execution (TV placement, primarily, the rest of the layout is great), impressed by the beer selection, decently surprised at the food (it was alright), and then disappointed by the crowd. \\n\\nNow my impressions, based on the changes I overheard people either complaining about or being stoked about when talking to bartenders, I would venture to guess that a) there is some new management, b) the new management is trying for a tad more discerning crowd (which would be totally alright with me), and c) this place might turn out to be totally awesome after all. \\n\\nI will definitely be keeping my eye on this spot. As far as a place to watch games, it may be my new go-to. When the weather gets nice, I see they have a sliding door they can open up. That's another major bonus. \\n\\nAll in all, I have high hopes, but a balancing amount of trepidation. Let's see if Blitz Ladd  can do it."},{"name":"Pok Pok NW","address":"1639 NW Marshall St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I got the Jin Hoom which was very flavorful but that's where the compliments end. It should have been served with rice.

The carnivore on one side and the Cadillac + arugula on the other side. With the large it's 8 slices total. \\nWith two people, we were only able to eat 6 slices.  It i honestly felt like if we got the regular and ate two slices each we would have been satisfied.\\nThe carnivore is your typical meat lovers. The pizza itself though is just so delicious. The cheese is baked into the dough and the way it's baked creates such an amazing crust. It's soft and crispy all at the same time.\\nThe Cadillac was prosciutto with balsamic glaze, and we added arugula. Adding arugula cost extra but it was a perfect addition. DELICIOUS. I loved it so much. \\nWe got the roasted broccoli and cauliflower which I liked. It was soft but crunchy. The flavor was plentiful. But i probably wouldn't get it again.

First time going to Rocco's where my boyfriend and I were racially discriminated against by a bartender working at the bar last night. A girl working the bar inside, Caucasian with long curly blonde hair refused to service us. She provided great customer service to the couples sitting next to us at the bar who were also Caucasian but as soon as I sat down at the bar she refused to greet us, provide a menu, give us water, take our order and acknowledge us. She would stare at us and see that we were ready to order and blatantly ignored us. My bf who didn't have a chair to sit was about to sit in the chair the previous couple left and the waitress said he could not sit. She said she was saving the chairs for another couple. First off I have never heard of a bartender reserving seats at a bar, it is always first come first serve. Secondly, the bartender could have told us this from the start when she saw we were waiting for a chair. When the couple did arrive they didn't even sit in the chair. They left it empty with my bf still standing around. 30 minutes passed and that chair still remained empty until another customer asked to sit and was granted yes by the bartender. The bartender never took our order and took every other persons order around us and made us wait. Finally some sweet gem, another bartender with short hair helped us. Granted it was Taco Tuesday and it was very busy but my bf and I have been to Rocco's on Tuesday nights before and never had horrible service like this.

Chang's, Panda Express, and Pei Wei to be \\"Asian Food\\", then go ahead and bump this up to 4 stars.\\n\\nThe theme here is Taiwanese street food. But while street food is supposed to be simple, cheap, and filling, Street achieved just the opposite. Don't get me wrong, the food here are good, especially with their seasoning. It's probably the best all-around Taiwanese street food in town... but only marginally.\\n\\nWhat you'll get here is food that are marginally better than the close alternatives in town (Coco's, Rice Bowl, etc.) at almost double the price and half the portion. You do the math. But if price is not a constraint for you, i.e. if paying $20 for 6 tiny pieces of sushi is normal for you, then I would recommend this place.\\n\\nHere are the 3 \\"snacks\\" we got for $40+ and left still feeling hungry:\\n\\nRoast Beef Onion Pancake ($10) - One tiny roll sliced into two along with taro fries. The rolls are about 1/3 the size of the ones from Rice Bowl Cafe. The taro fries were unique and had a tiny kick of spice with every bite.\\n\\nBerkshire Pork Belly Buns ($7) - If you've never had Asian \\"buns\\" before, this could be a delicacy. I mean it's pork belly. Of course it's delicious. Otherwise, there are MUCH better buns out there for cheap.\\n\\nViet Shaken Beef ($19) - Largest dish out of the three but still considered a \\"snack\\". They're essentially bite size steak cubes. The cook on the beef was great (medium rare). Comes with one small bowl of rice. A second bowl will cost you extra.\\n\\nOverall, this place makes no economical sense to us. When a place charges $10 for 3 dumplings, that's a clear red flag to avoid. I have no choice but to put them in the same category as P.F. Chang's. Same business model targeting the same clientele, just with small plates this time. Quite disappointing since the food was actually good, just not worth the price.

Sadly, have to agree with another reviewer that the only thing korean here was the kimchi and maybe one chef. \\n\\nCurry fries - seasoning mediocre, reminded me of a british pub style curry fries but with instant curry. The fries can loosely be classified as steak fries. They're so thick I'd rather call them chunks of potato instead of fries. Not sure if they were just lazy today when cutting them.  \\n\\nFried cauliflower - seasoning pretty good, but super oily. We received 5 pieces, although large, still seems a bit pricey\\n\\nHalmeoni kimchi - my main gripe about this dish was that mine came with not just one, but two hairs. Im not squeamish enough about that to waste food so I finished it anyways. Not sure if all the batches are consistent, but to be fair the kimchi was pretty good. This kimchi was well fermented so it had a great pickled taste as well as a notable kick in spice. Still crunchy as well but a bit low on the sweetness. If not for the hairs, this kimchi itself would be 4.5/5. Here's hoping your batch doesn't come with the bonus.\\n\\nFried chicken - pretty much the best thing I ordered. Even though it was togo the chicken still stayed crispy when I got back to my airbnb and the sauce was spot on. Includes peanuts so be careful if you have an allergy.

By the pool sits an outside patio and some tables were eating pizza and burgers.  Our six year old was \\"starving\\" so we looked for a hostess stand, sign, anything indicating where we were and found none.  We sat down and waited a few minutes, maybe five or ten.  Finally decided maybe we were in the wrong and reached out, \\"excuse me, are we allowed to seat ourselves or do we need to check in with someone?\\" We we're quickly put in our place with a curt \\"you can sit there but it may be a while.\\" We apologized and decided ok, we'll wait. Another ten minutes goes by, someone brings us menus and walks away.  We look at the menu, it looks great! The end. No contact at all. I set a timer for 15 minutes because at this point I'm almost positive my son may starve to death. Others come in through another door, not the patio that has a sidewalk that walks right out to the pool area, they are not only greeted but also have food quickly brought out.

So all in all the pizza is a high 4.  \\n\\nSo I did decide to go ahead and give this one 3 stars because if you're in the hunt for this style of pizza it's worthwhile to get if you're in the area.   This simply isn't a 4 star restaurant until the staff improves.  I would never recommend anyone drive from elsewhere though because if you're on the east side you should go to Borgatas and if you're near campus or downtown Columbus then you have Buckeye Slice, two pizza places which have not only better pizza but also have workers who actually seem to enjoy seeing customers, interacting with customers and can flash many a smile, you know...as if they really want and appreciate the fact that you're there...\\n\\nThis is a New York style pizza place and my dental surgeon is up in this area.  This is why I've been here twice.  Next time I think I'm up in the area though I will likely look for somewhere to eat that's a bit less depressing.  Really great pizza but if you're put off by the lack of a friendly pizza maker then beware.  It's a shame, with some less dismal staff this would have been 5 stars and on my Wall of Fame..."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious lobster rolls!

I had the brisket taco, a fish taco and a mahi-mahi taco. All of them were bland and uninspiring. While eating the fish taco, I had a distinct remembrance from my youth, that of eating frozen fish sticks. I'm not saying that's what they're serving, I'm just saying it doesn't taste fresh and it doesn't taste good. There are plenty of places serving tacos at less than half the price that are better tasting than these. I think this place would do well to be less creative and concentrate instead on authentic Mexican flavor. An example of this was the was Agua Fresca. Instead of a simple lemon and lime concoction, they added soda water which I've never had or seen in an Agua Fresca, and the drink tasted mediciny, Maybe because of the hibiscus? At any rate, it wasn't good. This place is way too expensive for the food to be so mediocre.

Tonight I decided to go back to my old routine(and college employer) and order \\"good old Domino's\\". I had a neighbor at my house and thought it ideal to get delivery. \\nBIG MISTAKE!! We ordered online but hardly noticed that the delivery time was almost 45 minutes later than the online estimate. No big deal. The pizza was stone cold. Not the end of the world, right?\\nI called the store but with no intention of waiting for another long pizza delivery. That's what ovens are good for and gosh, we were hungry. I sort of expected some kind of credit, offer for a free pizza on my next order, kindness, whatever. The call wait time was a good 10 minutes before getting a live person. When call was answerd I told this guy the problem and he said \\"hold\\". No \\"sorry's\\", no \\"we'll take care of you\\", no \\"sir's\\" or otherwise normal, human empathy.\\nAfter a few minutes, the female manager got on, I told her about the pizza and she curtly stated that they'll send another. I told her we were eating it but I was calling to see if I could get some sort of credit. She immediately got sassy, I protested, she hung up. I called again, waited through another pre recorded commercial, she got on (I was pretty steamed at this point), asked her if she really hung up on me and she owned it, I started to unload w/o cussing or yelling, she hung up again.\\nI then drove to the store. I was absolutely going to take this further (OVER A STUPID PIZZA ORDER) and I was sure the woman I spoke to on the phone wasn't really a manager). OMG, she was the manager! The exchange I had with her was breathtaking. It was like being in a movie. Total disrespect, dead-eyed glare with dismissive commentary. As busy as I thought they were (based on the times on hold), all 8-10 employees stopped what they were doing to watch this woman lecture me about trying to angle for a free pizza. I couldn't believe what she was saying: \\n\\"I shop at Nordstroms, and if I ain't happy, I take(s) it back\\", (her precise grammar). She continued...\\"I told you I'd send you another pizza and you can send the other back with the driver, but you ate it and just want another free one\\". I had made the mistake of telling her that I worked at that very store in college to which she replied \\"then you know how to work that angle\\" Yes, to score that free $6 pizza. Full disclosure:\\nI said a regrettable thing after she made a final jab at me in front of her staff. I told her  \\"don't be a sarcastic b**ch\\" for which I'm sorry. Her response...\\"your mother's a b**ch for not swallowing\\" That was greeted with much laughter by the staff. I, the customer simply walked out feeling pretty humiliated.

They are regulars, stopping there after work for margaritas and a quick dinner often.  When I walked in there was only one other table full of patrons.  So the restaurant was quiet and clean.  Our server Yurt welcomed us with a friendly greeting.  She was only one of two employees on the floor, so they also doubled as the bartender / maker of our drinks.  I ordered the original margarita, which I feel must not be ordered often, because it took both employees to gather behind the bar and discuss / try to make it for what seemed like 5 min.  I watched them struggle.  I kept an open mind and when the drink finally came to the table it tasted fine.  It did not blow me away, but it was not too sweet, and it was drinkable.  \\n\\nDuring this time all my co-workers were raving about the restaurant.  About how they have loved all the food they have ever gotten there, and how the chips, salsa, and guac are so good.  They went on, and on, and on until our food was served.  Then they raved about there dinners that they were eating at that moment.\\n\\nI truly had a different experience with my dinner.  I ordered the Tacos Al Carbon, which was to consist of three soft tacos with chicken (flour tortillas).  When I placed the ordered I asked Yurt if that was a good choice and she was agreeable.  After taking a bite, I completely disagree.  The chicken was extremely overcooked.  It was actually tough and dry.  On top of that it was tasteless.  On the side of the soft tacos was chopped white onion, supposedly cilantro, hot sauce, and pinto beans.  How is it possible that the chopped cilantro that they served was not fragrant and lacking any taste.  The beans and hot sauce were able to give the dry, tough chicken a little flavor.  \\n\\nIf I could I would give Los Jimadores a 2.5 rating because the space was clean, the noise level was low so it was easy to have a conversation, and Yurt, our server, was extremely friendly.  She definitely tried to please us all.  My co-workers all loved their dinner.

Opinions are subjective and clearly formed by personal experience. If you are used to really bad BBQ, then even average BBQ will seem like some of the best BBQ you have tasted. However, if you've traveled the country and tried BBQ in many states, cooked in different styles, at different prices, at different venues with different ambiances, you will probably discover that Salt Lick is actually completely overrated. It's one of the worst BBQ restaurants I have personally experienced. \\n\\nNote: I am from out of town (Arizona) and was only in town for a wedding. Local family suggested we drive 40 minutes out of our way to try the Salt Lick, which is regarded as some of the best. They were anxious to show us what Texas BBQ was like. Based on the 4,000+ reviews....this has to be good.\\n\\nWell, it wasn't. In fact, I had a hard time finding anything I liked about this place. Here are my biggest issues with Salt Lick:\\n\\n1. This place is cash only. What? This is 2019...who carries cash around anymore? OH and BTW, if you are from out of town and you go to an ATM get a couple hundred dollars out, its likely that your bank is going to assume something is wrong and block your transaction. When they do that, all you have to do is call them and let them know this is a legit transaction. BUT...guess what? NO CELL SERVICE. Another family member had to go get cash for me so I could pay for my family of 4. Very annoying, totally inconvenient and unnecessary. Food trucks take credit cards. You can pay with a ATM card from a street food vendor in Bangladesh, but not here at Salt Lick. \\n\\n2. Problem #2. No beer. \\nBBQ and beer go hand in hand. At Salt Lick, there is no draft beer, only bottles. No problem, I'll take a few bottles while I enjoy my meal....OH no, if you want a beer you have to walk outside and 3 buildings away you will find a shack, with a cooler where you can buy a bottle of beer and take it back to your table. Really? I can't order a beer from my server? NO you can't. Another hassle.\\n\\n3. Problem # 3. Food. I realize food is subjective and what some people call good BBQ is going to differ from what other people call good BBQ. I tired a combo plate with a Bison Rib and Brisket, along with beans and potato salad. First impression: The meat is dry and there is no sauce on it. Okay, not a problem, I'll put my own sauce on. In noticed some yellow sauce on the table, which must be some sort of mustard based BBQ sauce and another sauce that looked similar. No indication of what these sauces are, so I asked the server for some BBQ sauce. He brought me two of the same kind we already had on the table. Not impressed. I can't even describe what it was, but it was certainly wasn't a selection of the sweet, spicy, smokey, honey, molasses, brown sugar types you expect to find. \\n\\n4. Problem # 4. Still food. The Bison rib was stuck to the bone. You have to gnaw on it like a cave man to chew the dry meat off. If rib meat isn't tender, I mean fall off the bone tender, then I'm not interested. This meat had no chance of ever falling off the bone, it requires a saw. Brisket wasn't much better....very dry. it had a good flavor, but certainly not at all what I was expecting. Beans...very average, nothing special at all. Potato salad...actually, pretty good! \\n\\n5. Problem #5. Price. $26 is what I paid for my single bison rib and a couple dried slivers of brisket. $26? I'm sitting at a wooden picnic table, can't order beer, can only use cash, have to saw the meat off the bone, and its $26 for a plate. NOPE.\\n\\nGood news for Salt Lick is that I am not their target audience, since I'm not a local, I wont be back anyway. However, locals, if this is what 4,000 4 star reviews looks like...I feel very bad for these people. They must think a McDonalds quarter pounder is an award winning burger they would be happy to pay $10 for! My advice, find somewhere else to get your Texas BBQ.

Pork was probably the best, but the meats were definitely tender. Not nearly as much shrimp as say chicken or pork on the tacos, but still good. My partner got some fancy enchilados because he really likes adobo sauce. His plate was fully loaded. He always worries about fatty meat, but he didn't have any issues here. It was tender with a great flavor. He had so much I got a couple bites. It was really good. The only reason I'm knocking it down a bit is because he found a twist tie in his cabbage.

My empathy eventually drained after I had to verbally get someone's attention and ask for another drink after I'd been sitting empty at an especially dead period of time (between 4 and 6). I work in service and I get if someone is on their computer you don't want to bug them, but at one point I closed my computer and listened to two servers bitch about how much money they made 3 feet away from me for twenty minutes and no one did anything. Well, if you want to make money, you have to sell. Asking me if I want another drink is one of those selling techniques. I'm sitting at the bar so I'm not sure why the bartender/espresso girl wasn't responsible for it either but that's the way it went. I'm sure it sounds like hyperbole, but it's true. The food runner has been slouching and watching television for most of these three hours. The guy who I assume is a manager is more preoccupied with setting up TV channels than anything else.\\n\\nI highly recommend the place hire people who know how to train waitstaff because it's currently sub par.

But if they want to stay in business, it's better I break it to them.  \\n\\nFood:  The bowl of Korean seafood hot pot was so unimpressive, it looked like a pack of instant noodle with a meager amount of meat.  Two tiny pieces of shrimp, one piece of mussel, one piece of squid and three bits of pork for $9.  The plate of BBQ beef and rice was equally disappointing.

I have enjoyed other Austin eateries better, but, as I stated in another review, BBQ preferences come in three flavors: the flavor you prefer, the one you tolerate, and the one you don't like. And, then, you have to factor in the quality of the meat, and the overall dining experience.\\n\\nSalt Lick is an intentionally \\"no frills\\" restaurant with rustic picnic table seating inside and out, narrow aisles, and a \\"pay at the register\\" attitude. There was a short lunchtime wait, even though we were there on a weekday. We were guided to an indoor picnic table and given a menu to look over while our drinks were prepared. You can see their menu on line, by the way, at http://www.saltlickbbq.com/menu.htm.\\n\\nOur group ordered the all-you-can-eat family style meal, so we first timers could try a little of everything. They provide a well rounded meat selection, of beef, sausage and pork ribs, of which their brisket and sausage were the standouts. We were disappointed with the poor quality of the ribs. Others in our party stated that they were not up to par.\\n\\nThe sides included mild-mannered potato salad and Cole slaw, beans, dill pickles, raw white onions, and sliced bread for $14.95 each. It's $18.95 at dinner time and weekends.  We had a dish of blackberry cobbler for a shared dessert, which was an additional $5.95. Our iced teas were $1.75 each. A bit pricey, I thought.\\n\\nMy favorite barbecued meat is brisket, but I have to mention that the sausage dipped in their barbecue sauce was an instant hit with all of us. The brisket, while it was the best meat on the platter, was not the best I've found here in Austin. But, it may have just been an off day. The other reviewers here seem to revere Salt Lick's flavor and tenderness, so I'm going to have to reserve final judgment until I've been back a couple of times. \\n\\nOur first experience with them wasn't negative, really, but I will have to say, that our first plate of food was cold. And, it was delivered to us by the young man who was previously cleaning tables in our area. We didn't see our waitress until we had finished devouring our meal. \\n\\nOur host requested a few additional slices of hot brisket so we could experience it. He advised the waitress that our first plate of food was cold. She said that she couldn't understand how that could happen, since they cut the servings right off the spit on order. All we could guess was that she was otherwise engaged, and the buss boy was told to bring our platter to us. \\n\\nThe serving of brisket she brought back this time, however, was piping hot and much more enjoyable than the first. (Still, it wasn't as tender or flavorful as Rudy's.) We will definitely be going back to the Driftwood location, though. I'm pretty confident that the other reviewers' comments more accurately describe the normal Salt Lick experience, and we were just there on an off day. It happens in every business. Maybe next time I can be more generous with the stars."},{"name":"Burro Bar South End","address":"1357 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sooo good! I had the tacos and ceviche.

In addition, we were very excited to find out that on Mondays they have half off bottles of wine. \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle which they ended up being out of. The sommeliere suggested a different bottle at the same price point and it was fantastic. Service was also fairly good though I felt it drifted off a bit once we received our food. They brought us out more bread when requested though and everything came out of the kitchen FAST. As for what we ordered...\\n\\nWe both ordered...\\n\\nThe Hanger Steak: We both agreed that the hanger steak was amazing... however, for $11.50 the portion here was definitely small.This is not a tapa you want to order to share or if you are hungry and limiting your tapa choices.\\n\\nManchego and Jamon Croquetas: These were very good but no different than any other croquetas. Each plate had 4 small ones. I felt that this was a good portion for the cost (6.50).\\n\\n\\nI ordered....\\nCrispy Calamari: This was very meh. It tasted no different than any other order of calamari and was only average. The portion size was decent.\\n\\nCrab Slider (Initially ordered the Hamachi Crudo but it ended up not actually being current on the menu and was not available.): The crab slider was good. The roll could have used a little something something but this wasn't a bad choice. There was only one slider however for 9.50 so this is not an ideal tapa for sharing. \\n\\nThe SO ordereed....\\nGambas al Ajillo: This was essentially garlic shrimp. For 9.50 I definitely felt like this was a better dish than the crab slider. There were 6 shrimp I believe and I thought they were very good. The boyfriend enjoyed these as well. The leftover sauce was great with bread.\\n\\nA fish dish I can't remember: I can't remember the type of fish this was and its not on the online menu. However, this was about a 2 inch by 3 inch piece of fish on top 'salsa verde'. I thought this tasted very good, with a nice crispy skin, however it was also small for the price. \\n\\nOverall the food was pretty good. I enjoyed my boyfriend's choices more than my own. They brought out warm, free bread and olive oil which was delicious. The tapas came out very quickly and nothing was bad, however most everything was small.

But if you like traditional Irish music and dancing, this is a fun venue with talented musicians and dancers.\\n\\nWe ordered the Cider Salmon, Pie in the Sky and Fish & Chips. All the food was really excellent. Humble items done to perfection. Entrees can be heavy, but great for a comfort meal. It was the redemption of the restaurant. One issue - we wanted an item off the late night menu and the kitchen wouldn't do it. Maybe because the restaurant was obviously at capacity? Might have more luck on a slower day. \\n\\nOverall though I'd go back for the food and I'd be more specific for seating preference."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Barcelona Inman Park gets a solid four stars from me. I've been here twice, once to drink and once to eat AND drink. Both experiences were great, albeit with slight missteps. \\n\\nThe first time involved the server spilling a glass of wine. Totally an accident and he was very good about making it up to us. The wine, of course, was fantastic. \\n\\nThe second time was much more recent. I came with a large group and we tried a variety of food and drink items. Here is a list of some of the items we tried:\\n\\n- patatas bravas: a Spanish potato dish, it was unassuming but very snackable\\n- piquillo peppers: sweet and tasty, but somewhat forgettable \\n- ham & cheese croquettes: rich and cheesy, these were a huge hit\\n- potato tortilla: kind of a thick potato cake, pretty good\\n- chickpea cazuela: very flavorful, reminded me of an Indian spice palette \\n- chorizo & figs: another hit, this was a great balance of sweet and savory\\n- mushrooms: I didn't try these but the rest of the table loved them, several said this was their favorite dish\\n- watermelon salad: didn't try this either but the table seemed to enjoy it\\n\\nAnd then there was the paella. There is a vegetarian paella and a seafood one. They are both listed under the section that is meant for at least two people to eat. These are large portions meant as more like entrees. There were eight of us and we ordered one veggie and one seafood. The portions were, in fact, generous. \\n\\nThey were both very good. I did encounter some sand in one of the mussels, which sucked. But I think it was just a fluke so I let it go. Otherwise, the dishes were cooked beautifully. We ate until we felt like popping. \\n\\nNow for the missteps. We had also ordered beef empanadas and a beet salad. We asked after it was clear they weren't come out last. The server said that he'd placed the order and would check with the kitchen. Nothing. By the time we realized there was no hope of finishing the paellas, we asked the server to cancel those two dishes. We weren't too torn up about it because we had more than enough food but it was still frustrating. \\n\\nOn the boozy side of things, I stuck with one of the cabs listed, which was great. My friend tried some sort of white/clear sangria (the pitcher was like, $50 so she stuck with a glass) that was pretty good. Floral and mild, I would order it - and I don't even like sangria. \\n\\nOther than the issues with those two dishes that never came out, which seemed like an issue with the kitchen, service was fantastic. Our server was very accommodating. Our table was admittedly a little needy but he handled us like a pro. I wish I remembered his name so I could recognize him. \\n\\nThis is a great date spot.

The exterior walls host a variety of vendors: to your right is Flower Bar, beyond that is a woman who sells handmade soaps and beauty products, beyond that is another room with art, books and my favorite clever greeting cards on a spinning rack (you need to go yourself to see). In the main room continuing counter clockwise is a cupcake maker, a fabulous cookie bar and beyond that a coffee bar. That brings you around to the left side of the room and its anchor businesses: Jake's.\\n\\nThere's another room to your left as you come in, hosting framed photography on the walls, comfy couches and more intimate lighting with two adjoining alcoves (one filled by warm morning sun) for privacy and conversation. Back in the main room, you'll find couches, armchairs and the family table flanking retro ovens being used as displays for other locally made wares.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I didn't know much about Jake or his business adventures, and while I had patronized the Irwin Street Market (lunch at Jake's, flowers from Flower Bar for the housewarming, cupcakes from Button Cakes Bakery) I wasn't entirely clear on what was happening in the space, and hadn't given a lot of thought to the eclectic collection.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I got the 411 straight from Jake's mouth.

Perfect for plotting about and noodling your own business dreams, which you can see to fruition right there at the Irwin Street Market.\\n\\nOh yeah, and if you don't follow me on twitter you probably don't remember that several weeks back where I said that if I wasn't so lazy I'd start a small local produce stand.

Antico Pizza is, in many ways, Kool Korners spiritual successor -- hole-in-the-wall place, virtually no seating, authentic cultural pedigree, and very limited but arguably best-in-class food.  Okay, the parallels aren't identical since Kool Korners was pretty cheap whereas Antico is somewhat expensive (not that it's not worth it, mind you).  On balance, though, Antico has more normal business hours.\\n\\nAs you may have guessed from Yelp's collective fawning, Antico is the real deal when it comes to authentic Neapolitan pizza.  You can tell just by tasting the pizza that they use very high quality ingredients like Buffalo milk mozzarella and San Marzano tomatoes.  Now I'm not an expert when it comes to verifying the exact ingredient pedigree, so I'll have to take their word for it, but the pizzas certainly taste like they are using great quality ingredients.   \\n\\nNeapolitan pizza is somewhat of a specialty thing in the US.  When I was in Italy, this was the style of pizza I saw around (and ate). With more Americanized pizza styles, the cheese and sauce tend to be more uniformly distributed.  Call me an uncultured swine, but I'm actually not a huge fan of authentic Neapolitan pizza.  I prefer the New York style (and other American styles).  That being said, I went to Antico and bought a pizza wanting to try a few slices for dinner and ended up eating the whole pizza in one sitting.  Between the char on the crust, the great taste of the dough and the quality toppings, it was addictive.\\n\\nSo I'm not going to rock the boat here.  I think their food deserves a 5 as it is so far -- I'm not even a huge fan of Neapolitan pizza but I can tell they do it so very well.  The seating isn't a big deal for me and yeah, their prices are a bit high, but they're not really disproportionate given the quality of ingredients.  If they raise the prices any further or cheap out on the ingredients, I'll have to revisit the rating, but for now Antico is looking completely solid on the pizza."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're looking for a great meal served with great hospitality this is the place!

We decided to go for the tasting menu, because we literally eat everything and want to sample what the chef wants to show us. We happened to dine here during the week of Passover, so the menu had nods to traditional Jewish (specifically Passover) dishes.\\n\\nAmuse Bouche: it was interesting that we each got a different one. I had a teeny tiny bite of whitefish atop a sliver of a radish, while hubby had chicken liver on a piece of celery. Both were tasty. \\n\\nFirst Course: Smoked sablefish (black cod) with sumac and blood oranges. This was light and refreshing with obviously, a yummy smoke to it.\\n\\nSecond Course: Asparagus with poached egg, mushroom, and a delicious mushroom sauce. This was SO good. The asparagus was cooked perfectly - still a bit of a crunch. The mushrooms were the perfect complement and the egg on top just brought it all together. \\n\\nThird Course: the most amazing matzoh ball soup I have ever had (sorry, Grandma). I loved that the carrots and onions were diced really small so I had a bite of everything in each spoonful. The matzoh ball itself was perfect - firm so it did not crumble apart into the soup - with a lot of flavor. Well done. This may have been my favorite course of the night, honestly.\\n\\nFourth course: At this point I was a little full, but I can't say no to brisket. It was served with broccoli rabe that was nice and crisp (I'd imagine they flash fried it?), and had a black currant jus. Perhaps it was because I was already full, but I didn't enjoy this one as much as the soup. The meat was cooked well, but maybe there was too much black currant on it for my taste. \\n\\nIntermezzo: Panna cotta with apricot coulis and fennel pollen. This was awesome. But they served it in a square shot glass, with a normal size spoon. It's only a few bites worth, but so much was wasted in the corners of the glass. Give me a tiny spoon! Or put it in a more practical serving dish/glass.\\n\\nDessert: Again, we received two different things. Hubby received a creme caramel (like a flan) with a sesame cracker. It looked like it was only haif of the normal round shape. I preferred mine: arroz con leche with a shortbread cookie on top, and an amazing mango turmeric sorbet on top of that. It was incredible.\\n\\nAfter coffee, they brought us yet ANOTHER dessert-like treat, which I think they may give to everyone. Served in tiny espresso cups, I don't remember what it was, but it tasted like a vanilla milkshake with citrus.\\n\\nService was great; our waiter Phil was attentive and fun and took the time to get to know us and chat with us a bit.

There's always a line but it goes really fast. You have to wait for a table, but again, spots open up quickly.

They have plenty of seating if you get there at a reasonable time. There is usually someone playing live music outside. If you forget to BYOB, there's now a location on-prem to buy wine and beer. You don't have to line up early in the morning to get some chow. The combo plates let you taste two meats, plus healthy portions of the really delicious sides. I'd recommend getting smoked turkey and sausage, but they're also known for brisket and beef ribs. Get the spicy bbq sauce - not hot at all but much more flavorful than the regular sauce. Oh and save plenty of room for the blackberry and peach cobbler combo with ice cream. A refreshing end to a heavy meal.\\nAs for the cons? It's become one of the biggest tourist traps in Austin. Swarms of people everywhere just stuffing their faces with food. The food is undeniably not as good as some of the smaller, hyper local barbecue places. You NEED cash. They have an ATM on-prem, but you don't want to have to pay ATM fees on top of top of the pricey bbq.\\nSure, it's worth the trip out once. But the food just isn't. the. best. Not sure if it used to be better and suffered when they started serving such mass quantities of people (one employee I talked to said he'd estimate the most they serve in a day is 8,000 people) and shipping it across the country. This isn't your small-town bbq pit anymore, it's a business that has done a really good job of making sure everyone feels like they have to visit when they're in Austin. They aren't paying careful attention to the quality of each plate (i.e. you can very easily get a portion of meat that's like 25% fat). \\nAll that being said, if you're looking for a Texas BBQ experience (not just the best food you can get) and you have a car, it's worth the afternoon drive. Eat some bbq and stop at the swimming holes and distilleries nearby. Make it a day trip."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We went back here twice. Solid coffee. Good pastry.

We started at the bar outside and I ordered everyone drinks (beers) and myself a crown and coke. Keep in mind it was not busy or loud. The bartender brought the beers and I ended up with a Corona as opposed to my order. Being the patient customer I am, I figured he might have a hearing issue or maybe I sounded like I had marbles in my mouth so I did my best to finish the Corona (I'd rather drink a hot Pepsi I found on the side of the road). We were seated quickly as we had a reservation (in case it was busy). Our waiter provided chips and fresh salsa and suggested some guacamole made table side. That is where the stars come in. Those items were fresh and tasted good. We ordered and our food came out in a timely fashion and everyone's order was correct. I ordered the carnitas burrito and was not impressed. It was two small flour tortillas with the equivalent of some Sonny's BBQ pulled pork and some refried beans and yellow rice. I'll admit I'm not a food allergy expert but I suspect someone with a dairy allergy could have eaten my burritos with no issue because I couldn't find/taste the cheese. Mice would have turned their noses at the lack of cheese on this dish. And all that was $15 or $16 which should be a pretty jam-up burrito that needs to be delivered via wheel barrow elsewhere. I saw a lot of people ordering the $15 margaritas that must do a good job drowning your sorrows after eating the most disappointing $15 burrito known to man. I seriously considered running through a Taco Bell on the way home. A cheesy Gordita crunch would have been an upgrade. I gave this place two stars because the server was nice, the place was clean and our orders (outside of the bar) were accurate and timely - honestly some basic stuff.

I have to elaborate. I need to start with the crust. In my opinion it's everything you could always want to carry your toppings. Chewy, crispy and full of deliciousness. The sauce....simple. Crushed tomato and just enough to compliment everything. Not too sweet, not over spiced. Just right. The proportion of cheese and toppings are a compliment to the \\"canvas \\" if you would of your pizza. I have not found a better Sicilian pizza yet. Going to college 30 years ago not far from Cleveland circle Pino's has been a institution for me. Well worth a long walk up and down a hill from Newbury college in my youth the Sicilian pizza today is just as good today as it was then. Quality is the key. Yeah maybe the guy on the phone is a bit gruff....but the food is always tasty. From hot and cold grinders to Sicilian or regular pizza and yes even salads you won't be disappointed.

Despite this fact, they are slower than some of the gourmet pizza places in PDX.  They have never had the pizza ready when they tell you  and there's literally like 10 people working.  Keep in mind that this is for pizza that is largely pre-prepared and mass delivered.  This is a relatively new location and historically will be kept under a watchful eye by corporate to make sure they execute to the company standard.

The inside cashier area is such a disaster though.  The counter takes up half the room so only 2 people can stand in line comfortably and then the rest line up awkwardly in the tiny room, as the line beings to curl into the dining room area (which is already small.)

The day I went it was Friday and it was $2 Corona which is decent.  The food that my roommates absolutely has to have every week are the flautas ahogadas in tomatillo sauce (green sauce.)  Its more like a soup than a creamy sauce.  If you've ever had tortilla soup, this is basically the same thing.  You get as many flautas as you so please, and if you decide to go \\"ahogadas\\" they drown your flautas in tomatillo or tomato sauce topped off with melted cheese, similarly texture to tortilla soup melted cheese.  I do say its so unique and lovely that I enjoy the flautas every time I go.  However, the quality of cooking is pretty inconsistent.  Sometimes the flautas taste burnt, I mean come on.

I haven't had them personally but she says they're awesome.\\n\\nThe reason I would recommend this place is the fact that they are the only place that serves flautas ahogadas (drowned in sauce, more like a soup) and its pretty cheap, even without the daily specials.  \\n\\nSome intangibles were they have nice tv's to watch sports on.

Once waiter's came by he right away started with asking us for drinks while most tables the waiter's were explaining the concept and how it all works. However throughout the night other waiter's were very friendly and great in explaining the dish. We had 10 courses and 2 drinks each. It was slot of food but all very unique and delicious. The smell of food in the room was very interesting concept and made us very hungry. My favorite was appetizers and desserts! I had a great time and I thought price was reasonable with amount of food we ate. We had Thai Muslim influenced food and it was very tasty , however the food was heavy and I thought needed to have a better balance . By second entree we were already full so had to take most of food home."},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic slices. Great subs.

Perhaps it's not standard for this place but I do appreciate having some water in addition to my drink.\\n\\nAs a drink I had an iced chai latte and for food got the Cape Codder with a side of sweet potato fries. My SO got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich that came with a side of fries. We also got the mega tots to share. The food came out pretty quickly as well.\\n\\nThe iced chai was lightly sweet, but I wished it had a stronger chai tea flavor than what just seemed to be cinnamon/chai spice sprinkled on top. The Cape Codder sandwich was also decent, the challah bread was nice and fluffy. The star for me were the sweet potato fries! The mega tots were also decent, but I had them with the Cholula provided on the table to give it some more oomph.\\n\\nOverall, it was quite mediocre for my first experience but I do plan on going again and trying some breakfast/brunch items because that seems to be what everyone raves about!"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Come with a big appetite!!

While we were reviewing Italian places in Boston this one caught our eye so we decided to set a reservation and check it out. The place was busy, which we took to be a good sign. Any restaurant that's worth it will be busy on a Saturday evening. We waited our 10 minutes to be sat and were led into the basement which frankly, felt like a dungeon. At first, I hated being down there but eventually I warmed up to it and learned to enjoy it.\\n\\nThe non-existent lighting gave to a more mellow ambiance and kept conversations lower throughout the basement seating area. At first this too annoyed me, as we were there to have a good time, but I adjusted. After being sat we waited, and waited for someone to take our order. By the time they arrived at our table we ordered drinks and dinner at the same time to try and make it easier on our server. Instead, he just seemed annoyed with our order. We tried to spin it as, \\"Hey man, we're all servers, we're trying to be helpful. We will be low maintenance just keep the drinks coming.\\" He honestly couldn't have been bothered, which was unfortunate.\\n\\nThe food is the only redeeming quality to this place. We split three dishes between the three of us girls and it was the perfect amount of food. All of the dishes were not only cooked to perfection but seasoned deliciously. After we received our food we again, didn't see our server for lengthy periods of time as our drinks went unfilled and empty plates sat ready to be taken. We definitely would have liked to beef up our bar tab, but our server simply didn't seem interested in our money. Fine by us, we grabbed our tabs at the next possible chance and went to a restaurant down the street to end our night. While on our way out we realized that we were the only table that had not received the bread and oils at the beginning of our meal as literally every other table around us had.

So I ask the question again,\\" what button do I push to use my debit card as a credit card?\\" With a smirk on his face he shrugs his shoulders like that was very appropriate.\\n\\nNot deterred I decided to push the red button and it worked and once I relayed to him that you use the red button to complete the credit transactions without entering a pin.

Remember the Pleasure Island part of the movie? That seems to be the inspiration for this particular quick service. \\n\\nOkay, that may be a bit dramatic. It was not my choice to go here, this is why I check yelp reviews, but circumstances dictated a stop. When little ones are in the party sometimes food is simply needed. I should also say that I did not order my own meal, I did try a couple bites of the flatbread. While palpable and the children liked it enough, this was one of the times I can not justify Disney Dining/take it for what it is. The food is boring amusement park, enough flavor to be fine...but the prices, I just can not justify or ignore them here. I also do not understand how other reviewers are calling the salads pretty good when the accompanying picture is iceberg lettuce topped with a small scoop of chopped tomatoes, cucumber and red onion. Pretty good compared to just the bagged lettuce from the grocery store without anything on it?\\n\\nMy other main complaint is the environment and atmosphere. Pinocchio's is one of the cavernous quick services cramped with tables. Despite the size, and the negatives reviews, it was completely full. Finding a table during peak dining times is an exercise in patient and persistence, level of difficulty depending on your party size. By poor design or simply the shear number of people, it is loud. Voices and the scraping noise of chairs echo though the space. If you manage to obtain a table your entire group can fit at, you may need to GPS the location to other members of your group. \\n\\nOnce finished, the you will be questioned repeatedly if you are done and are leaving by the next desperate for a table. Despite having been in this position just a short time previous, you will feel cancerous for being asked. After achieving a table that fits your entire party, and allows your still sore feet to take a break, it is your table until you decide to vacant it. Eventually the noise and level of stimulus will drive you out.\\n\\nPinocchios gets two stars because 1. the kids seemed to enjoy the flatbread and happy, not hungry, kids are always a good thing 2. there was AC and 3. there were chairs, that we manage to find and fend off, and sitting occurred."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"You will love this place as long as you don't want Pepperoni and Mushrooms on the same pizza.....because you can't have it.

The space is very spacious, open and contemporary. It is a nice atmosphere. We ordered three different dishes. The cuban sandwich was tasteless and boring. The fried avocado taco plate lacked flavor and was not warm when served. The queso appetizer was tasty. For the cost of the meal, we were disappointed. \\n\\nThe second visit was a weekday for lunch. When we arrived, we waited at the host stand for about 5 minutes and others gathered behind us, as well, waiting for a host. The restaurant was not busy and there appeared to be plenty of staff walking around. We were a group of 8 and they only have one table in the whole restaurant to accommodate a group this size. They have many round 4 top tables throughout the restaurant which can not be pushed together to seat larger groups. It is an unfortunate furniture choice. We were seated at 2 separate tables for the meal. Overall, our group was not impressed with the food. Keep in mind, most of us have visited other Kerbey Lanes and have a positive opinion of the restaurant. The brownie dessert was inedible. The brownie was so hard, we could barely cut it with a knife and a lot of force.

It is served Asian style with little pancake type things and some hoisin sauce and some toppings so as you slice away at the cheek and ear and the skin you get to make little wraps which actually made it easier for me to eat. Matt however was having a field day with it! His eyes were all aglow just like a 5 year old on Christmas morning! I didn't want to order it, but the look of his face even at the idea of it was simply priceless.\\n\\nAnd boy were we full. That crunchy skin from the slow roasting is pretty awesome I do have to say. I think those should be turned into chips or something because it is addicting. Overall a fatty dish since it is well, you know, a pig's head, and I actually was fine with it until we got to its eye socket and saw its teeth! Yup, it was all there. But we asked our waiter where the tongue was and he said he had never thought about that and honestly had no idea why it wasn't eaten....hmmm...There is food for thought!\\n\\nThis dish was definitely a unique experience you can't get very many other places.

The ambiance is a bit too loud for first-date conversation, even though we were in a quieter corner of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe both got the \\"1/2 Salad or Soup & Sandwich\\" -- the waiter was kind enough to explain that I could get a 1/2 salad AND soup (the conjunctions in the menu description are slightly deceptive), so I got a bowl of the turtle soup and the nature salad.  I probably wouldn't have known that the soup was turtle without someone telling me, since it was just like a tomato-based vegetable soup with chunks of meat.  I always forget how much I don't like raw walnuts though, but after pushing them to the side of the plate, the salad was very good.  Patrick (cutesy moniker still being discussed) had a Reuben with his bowl of soup, and suggested that I make a note that the iced tea is made from a powder and not actually brewed.  Our server kept our waters and the tea filled throughout the meal.\\n\\nIt's not really a scene that I would immediately revisit, but if someone suggests it again, I'd come back.

It plays with traditional Indian flavors (like carrot Halva) and combines them with the best carrot cake you can imagine.\\n-All of the main dishes are amazing, but we particularly liked the fish dishes.

I wanted a good sample of everything and ended up getting the Rancher Platter which had brisket, pork ribs, sausage and turkey. Then for good measure I got a double cut beef rib. \\n\\nFirst off I really really pleased with how friendly the staff was. We were literally the first people there and the first ones in the door and like the giddy BBQ tourist I had my camera at the ready to get pictures of the pit. The pit masters immediately invited me over to get a better vantage point and up close with the meat that was grilling which felt kind of like a theme park ride at that point, as they explained what each meat was and how they have been cooking them and rotate them around the grill. After my BBq tour was over we got seated in a nice section giving us a peak out the window and our waitress was really amazing and nice. Catered to our every request and questions with a smile, and as the dozens of people poured in she never made us felt neglected.\\n\\nThe Food: Being a pretty harsh critic of BBQ I can say with certainty that the BBQ here is pretty fantastic. My favorite being the sausage and the pork ribs which for me are the best I have ever had. They were both cooked perfectly and full of flavor I was expecting. The turkey and beef ribs were my next favorite with the turkey being a little bland in my opinion, but that was easily solved with some sauce and salt. It was tender and not dry though which is a welcome change. The brisket to me was my least liked meat choice which is why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5. Brisket is the king staple of a BBQ location in my opinion and it just fell flat for me. It wasn't really all that tender nor was it really all that flavorful on its own which kind of surprised me. I am willing to surrender the potential of it being a \\"first cut\\" type of scenario being the first ones there, but I have heard from others that the brisket can be hit or miss sometimes.\\n\\nBeing the first ones there helped to give time to wait around and look at the property and to me the ambiance and overall appearance was exactly what I was expecting for a BBQ place. It was rustic but organized and had several farm hands scurrying about which helped to add to the atmosphere of a real out of the way, rural location. There are a dozen or so weather worn picnic tables outside, in a nice covered courtyard, and inside is mostly the same with wooden tables and a cabin type of feeling which added to the experience being overall really nice. I definitely want to come back and try the other meat and plates they have, plus more sausage and pickles, which were also amazing BTW. I do highly recommend this as a stop in for some good BBQ in a nice rustic setting making a great overall experience to the BBQ culture."},{"name":"Memories of Peru Pollos a La Brasa","address":"8204 Crystal Clear Ln, Ste 1600","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Estuvimos buscando muchos restaurantes a los alrededores de Orlando y encontramos este restaurante que ten√≠a buenos Reviews.

My Tuna melt was simply GORGEOUS!!!!! filled with tasty tuna and cheese and I think it had some kind of pickled slaw on sour dough bread. I was too busy licking my fingers.\\n\\nI did sample my co workers Reuben and it was.... \\"Slap yo momma good 10 steps back\\". LOADED with tender tasty meaty goodness. I can't stress enough to go visit. I will make my first visit Saturday."},{"name":"Sodo Sushi Bar & Grill","address":"25 W Crystal Lake St, Ste 175","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Love the Black Panther roll!

There's always a lot to take home as well. The offer home made pies which are delicious! They are a BYOB establishment and also offer a wine tasting room. You can buy Texas brewed beer and wine there as well. If you go to salt lick during the summer on the weekend expect about an hour wait. It's well worth it though! They have fresh squeezed lemonade and popcorn outside to purchase while you wait out in the heat.

I got a limonata that came with a nice piece of sugar cane to chew on and I got one of my favorite dishes, Ropa Vieja. Shredded beef with peppers and onions that cooked down until it is melt in your mouth tender. My side was some really well done rice and beans that were cooked with bacon and they put some pickled red slaw and some beets on the plate as well. Quite a bit of food for only $8.75. I was brought some banana sauce and hot sauce. The banana sauce was on the sweet side while the hot sauce didn't have a big kick in spice, it had huge amounts of flavor and I think I used at least a quarter of the bottle. I'd drink it if I was allowed to.\\n\\nThe service was great, and if you ride a bike, you can get an extra 5% off your bill. Every little bit counts.

Mostly because there was actually seating space here. Most stands do not have this, so this is one plus going for this spot.\\n\\nBased on the number of Yelp reviews, this appears to be the most reviewed Thai food stand in Portland. Not my reason to visit, but I guess I headed for the stand that was the most popular when I was there. The menu is full of standard Thai classics like curry and pad thai sold at awesome prices. Even saw some dishes that I found to be a bit different that I have not seen in Seattle like mango curry.\\n\\nI wanted rice noodles so I got the pad kee mao with chicken ($6). The wait was about 10 minutes and I expected it to be sort of lengthy due to the small space and popularity of the place. After getting my dish, I took a seat on the wooden bench in the seating area and digged in.\\n\\nThe portion size was not huge, but it was sufficient. Flavor was just okay although I liked that they use different color bell peppers in the dish. Orange and yellow peppers are much more interesting in flavor then the predictable green. It was a sufficient meal and I think that this all you can expect from a humble space like this.

Magazine writers fawn over the Salt Lick, and many of my contemporaries see this place as the Valhalla of 'Cue.\\n\\nYou probably also know that getting to this Salt Lick takes forever and a day.  After 30 minutes, I seriously began to think we were lost driving up from San Marcos.  By the time you finally arrive, you really want to check yourself in to Barsana Dham instead.\\n\\nAt any rate, cutting to the chase...\\n\\nWhere they could improve:\\n- Cash only, no plastic (unless you count withdrawals from their proprietary ATM).\\n- One check per table, and no splitting of checks (even when necessary for business travel).  What they will do, however, is provide duplicate checks.\\n- Parking lot is expansive, unpaved, and quite dusty.  Beware of rock projectiles shooting at you from passing vehicles.\\n- No loading/unloading zone for the handicapped and the disabled parking is a bit of a trek across an expanse of rocky, somewhat rutted driveway. This poses a real challenge to wheelchair users.  And I do think the Americans with Disabilities Act applies in Driftwood.  ;)\\n- BYOB.  Bring your own cooler, because unlike many places without a beer/wine license, they have no facility to keep your beer cold for you.\\n- The sides.  From worst to best, the potato salad gets an \\"F\\", the coleslaw gets a \\"D\\", and the beans get a \\"C\\".\\n- Their pork ribs are nothing special.\\n- Value.  Plan on $25/head with tip at lunch if ordering a combo plate, tea, and dessert, about $6/head more for unlimited family style.  Note it's more expensive to eat the same meal portion here in the evening than at lunchtime.  This far out in the boonies, you'd think you'd catch a break based on the low overhead.\\n- Restrooms.  Very clean and well attended, but cramped (one potty, one sink, and two stand-ups) and not quite up to the volume of foot traffic this restaurant generates.  Expect another line here, so don't wait too long!\\n\\nWhere they really shine:\\n- Sausage is damn near perfect.  If it could be better, I don't know how.  I don't like most BBQ joint sausage, and this sausage has the ideal flavor and texture.\\n- Brisket is also excellent.  I got the standard lean, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I still like the brisket at Donn's BBQ in Oak Hill better, but that's a value/convenience thing.\\n- Desserts.  Blueberry, peach, combo, or pecan pie served warm with a generous scoop of Blue Bell.  I will rave specifically about the pecan pie, as it's one of the most perfect I've had in these parts.\\n- Service.  I know this wasn't true, but it seemed throughout the meal as though our waitress was literally our personal, private server.\\n\\nMy advice?\\n- Rob a bank (or two) before you head here.\\n- Starve a day in advance and order family style.  Cutting breakfast just ain't enough.\\n- Skip the ribs, and stick with the sausage and brisket.\\n- Leave room for dessert by all means.\\n- Be prepared for the food coma to ensue.\\n\\n[Please note that the attached owner's comment refers to an earlier edit of this review which was ambiguous concerning what I meant by \\"paid reviewer\\".

The most important, though, is the food (of course!).\\n\\nWe had to go with the butternut squash ravioli with asparagus and proscuitto marscapone cheese sauce. When we discussed it, the woman at the table next to us leaned over and said, \\"It's delicious,\\" pointing to her plate. I don't even like butternut squash all that much, but this dish was amazing. Slightly sweet, not to cheesy or salty, but just the right balance of everything - tastes, textures, etc. \\n\\nWe also ordered the veal marsala with came with a side of spaghetti with marinara sauce. This was great, but not as good as the ravioli. It was extremely flavorful, and they didn't skip on that rich, unique marsala wine taste. We ordered it because it was only a dollar more than the chicken marsala, and we thought, \\"When is veal ever this cheap?\\" The veal was very tender and we liked this dish a lot.\\n\\nAnother really fantastic thing about Giacomo's is the camaraderie you feel with all the people waiting in line with you but especially with the people you're dining with because the place is really that small. People had to move their chairs every time someone wanted to get by, elbows were hitting strangers' elbows and servers had to reach over diners to get food on the table. Sounds really annoying, but everyone seemed to have a positive attitude about it and just rolled with the punches. \\n\\nThe last wonderful thing I have to say about this restaurant is that it's easy on the wallet. We paid $32 (not including tip) for two entrees and we were fully, fully satisfied. \\n\\nTip: if you don't want to wait, get there BEFORE they open. Seriously. \\n\\nAnother tip: every additional person in your group adds to your waiting time exponentially. Seriously. y = x^2. Because our group and the group in front of us had parties of two, we got seated before the 15 people in line ahead of us.\\n\\nBut enjoy! It is seriously seriously worth it."},{"name":"Taqueria Villanueva","address":"281 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Always happy to see these guys!!!

But it is, hands down, the most overrated restaurant on Yelp.\\n\\nDon't get any of the sides. They're all sub-par. All of them.\\n\\nThe brisket, which I've had on at least four occasions, has always been as good as what you'll get at any Bill Miller location--no better. I say this as someone who likes Bill Miller, but it's certainly less expensive and infinitely less hyped. \\n\\nThe sausage tastes just like Hillshire Farms from HEB. Again... I don't have a problem with Hillshire Farms from HEB. It's just not what I expect from a place that so many people* rave about.\\n\\nThe sauce is good, the turkey is good, and the chicken is excellent. The service is okay. The atmosphere is a bit much for me, but 99 percent of the clientele is boozing it up (it's BYOB, and on Saturdays and Sundays just about every party brings ice chests, bottles of wine, boxes of wine ...). Indeed, aside from ignorance about what good barbecue actually is, many of the Salt Lick's great reviews no doubt come from the fact that when you're drunk, just about anything tastes good.\\n\\nAlso, a place this size that doesn't accept credit/debit cards is going out of its way to inconvenience its customers and squeeze as much money as it can from them by reaping those ATM fees. \\n\\nThis place isn't bad at all--don't get me wrong. But for the drive, the hype, the wait and the price, you're better off going somewhere else. This place is for tourists.\\n\\n* \\"so many people\\" means tourists and new arrivals, mostly from California. On rare occasion, a Central Texas native will rave about the Salt Lick.

We were very specific about making certain we had very hot plates, temperature of our steaks and how our side dishes were to be cooked-- well nothing came out the way we asked; plus the bone in filet was grainy and lacked flavor.

The difficulty in finding parking should've foreshadowed what was to come; we circled the complicated layout of the lot for about ten minutes before finding a spot. The interior appeared pretty homey, with lots of people inside and out. The employee who took my order of the Draft Latte had a major RBF but got it out super quick; however, I was disappointed by the super bland taste of coffee, yet while creamy and latte-like, tasted nothing like the cold brew I was expecting. My friend ordered the original cold brew and it was... essentially brown water. It was even weaker in taste than mine, completely watered down with probably a higher water than coffee ratio. What a waste of five bucks. We spotted the free coffee samples they had out in the front and resorted to pouring a couple shots in our cups to add some actual coffee flavor to our fake coffee (noticeable improvement).

We went on a tour with a guide who took us to the area (just the two of us) and wine tasting.\\nThe restaurant has an interesting history.\\nWhat the Salt Lick BBQ is good for is a photo of the BBQ being made when you first walk in (not the food).\\nWe ordered the Beef BBQ Ribs at just under $30 for one person.  We got two ribs as indicated in the menu, and they were all fat and bone.  No meat.  We were VERY disappointed.\\nThe coleslaw was room temperature and is the vinegar coleslaw (not the cream type).\\nThe potato salad was crammed on the plate up against he coleslaw, was warm, and looked like mashed potatoes with barbecue sauce inside it.  Not potato salad at all.  \\nThe beans on a scale of one to ten were a seven, not bad, but not as good as we expected.\\nYou get onion, pickles and white bread with the meal.\\nThis restaurant is more of a novelty than it is a foodie destination.  As you can see by the other reviews which are also only a two or three star,  people have become disappointed.\\nIt is large, seats about 800 people from what the tour guide said, and since it is out in hill country, perhaps it is a destination on the weekend and after going there many, many times, you figure out what to order, but for out-of-towners we would not know what is the \\"best\\" item on the menu.  \\nAs others have said, nothing had any real smoke flavor to it.

She then tells me to park out front.. I pull my car around. I'm sitting there with my daughter.. We sat out front for 15+ minutes.. Nothing is happening, my daughter goes to the front door and it's locked.. She is knocking on the door looking in.. There are three employees behind the counter all making sure they DON'T look at the front door or acknowledge her knocking on the door.. She comes back to the car.. It's now been 20+minutes that we've sat ignored. So we pull back around to the drive thru and I say, hey I was the one who ordered the 20 Tacos.. We've been sitting out front, knocking on the door and I'm wondering what's going on? My Personality (Izaiah) Snarls over the speaker I WAS OUT FRONT I WENT TO THE FRONT DOOR! I tell him WE knocked on the front door and you all ignored us.  He comes walking across the grass to the drive thru and shoves the food bag into my open car window mumbling and swearing the entire time.. So we are now in line waiting to pass by the pickup window. We get to the window and I realize there is no taco sauce, so we stop at the window. The three guys are all right there all NOT looking at us.. So we sit at the drive thru window for another 4-5 min with several cars behind us.. The older of the three men finally opens the window and I ask for the taco sauce.. He hands me two.. I say may I please have more? And he hands me two HUGE handfuls.. And that's the end of the taco experience from BURGER KING HELL.. The behavior of the entire staff was absolutely atrocious.. I am a business owner across the street, my employees eat at this restaurant for lunch often.. We take food from here to our workers during the week.. I've lived and worked in this area for 20+years and this was truly THE WORST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE I have had in YEARS.. My assistant has been complaining about a employee during the afternoon for a week now.. I am sure we had the same one tonight.. I think Burger King better do more drug testing this guy was high..\\nI take the tacos home and we have 19 not 20 and half have a rice size piece of lettuce, one had nothing.. They would of been better off just telling me they were out of tacos instead of wasting 30 minutes of my life, making crappy food and serving it with snarling snarky attitude..

It's refreshing to see a restaurant in the area seek to outdo itself. The cocktail and food menus are constantly being refreshed; something that requires a daily commitment to excellence. The Fish Tacos and Plantain Soup were our favorites on older menus but the Grits Arancini (fried grit puffs), Smoked Fish Hush Puppies, Chimichurri Steak, and Roasted Oysters with Wild Ramp Butter are our current favorites. \\nThe cocktail menu changes daily too but it's all good. The Hibiscus Gin and Tonic and the Jam with Vodka are keepers. The draft beer selection is small but well-chosen.   \\nThe artwork is top notch as well; one feels they're in a fine art gallery. There's not much to critique; 1921 knows what they are doing and it doesn't seem that the exit of the celebrity chef Norman Van Aiken has hurt them at all. In fact, we never felt he was involved in the day-to-day operations anyway. \\nThat said, Jim L's purely political \\"review\\" should be taken down by Yelp were they to let their gaze leave their IP address logorhythms and actually read their own reviews. Food and politics don't mix.

It's very convenient to the Back Bay Amtrak station (just across the street), and had a nice open feel to it. The menu was interesting, with an emphasis on combos of items, almost like a collection of tapas. Although the menu looked large at first, offering a diverse set of choices, we realized after we sat down that the combos took up half of the menu, and there were not very many choices outside of those combos.\\n\\nWe ended up with the margarita pizza and the BLT, both of which were excellent. The pizza didn't mention what size it was on the menu, but turned out to be enormous - plenty for two people - and we wished that the waitress might have warned us about that when we ordered two meals. \\n\\nIt probably would have been a nice stop on our train ride, but the room has enormous fans hanging from the industrial ceiling, which were blowing cold air on us with enough force to blow my wife's hair around. Customers who sat down next to us started shivering immediately and moved to try to avoid the vortex, but there really was no escape - even the large ceiling lights swayed with the amount of air movement in the restaurant. We asked if they might be able to turn down the fans, and the waitress said 'sure!'... and nothing ever changed.\\n\\nSo, pack your parka in August and give it a shot if you want an interesting menu of pig parts."},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Agree with most of the other 1-3 star reviews.

They need to have someone out there with the new employees, ensuring they are properly trained.  I understand they lost some of their best staff (and one of the reasons I came in), but a simple discussion about how to prep an order correctly is what is really needed.\\n\\nThe last time I went, I ordered nachos.  We all know this comes with a good serving of delightfully melted cheesy goodness.  Instead, the person took the ladle, poured over half of it back into the vat, and then poured half of the remainder onto the chips.  This equates to about a \\"side\\" order, which is not the standard for nachos.  So I asked for more.  Repeat same procedure.  All the cheese was also placed smack dab in the middle of the container, not spread out at all, meaning the exterior chips were woefully dry.  So you would think this skimping would continue.  Well, we get to chipotle ranch (something the previous workers got me hooked on) and she basically drowns the chips in it!  Um... what?  Additionally, prior to all this, when spooning the chicken onto the nachos, a good amount landed on the counter.  She picked them up and placed them in the container.  That is supposed to be disposed of, not placed in the container, due to the possibility of cross contamination with the other ingredients that may land there, no matter how clean you think it is.  This is part of food handling in a quick service setting.  All this said, I wanted out of there, paid, and left.\\n\\nOther things of note: The fresh onions are always inundated (read: swimming) with water and look old.  Same with cucumbers.  The chicken is normally overly charred.  You never know what proteins are all really available, because they keep half of them in the fridge even during lunch/ dinner rush (when having them out would speed up service at those in demand times).  Half the time the rice is still crunchy, meaning undercooked.\\n\\nMy Moe's experience is that I am from Atlanta, a place where I had Moe's before I had even heard of Chipotle.  My friends, family and I went there a good number of times.  My undergrad had a Moe's on campus, the most visited dining location (especially on Sundays and Mondays). It was my go to for a quick dinner between rehearsal and work as a junior and senior.  So I like to think I know my Moe's, and I know the ones at my undergrad and near my high school not only trained their staff better and had better quality, fresher ingredients, but they also remembered to YELL \\"Welcome to Moe's!\\""},{"name":"Pok Pok NW","address":"1639 NW Marshall St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Worst service ever.

Four tables sat empty and ready for 20 min before she seated anyone. Spoke to one couple who had been waiting 45 min and the lady sat people who came after them, before them. Ridiculous!

This was the absolute worst Thai food that I've ever had in my life (in Boulder and NYC)\\n\\nTo begin with, the service was quite poor and the server who took my 'to go' order seemed really annoyed that I was asking him about the spice rating.  I overlooked this as I worked in restaurants for close to 10 years and I know that I most certainly was not always the most courteous person to patrons, so I ignored the attitude and just chalked it up to him having a bad day.\\n\\nAnyway - the food.  I ordered the veggie drunken noodles and a papaya salad - boy was I disappointed.  There were hardly any vegetables and the veggies that managed to make it into my order were limp and mushy. The flavor/sauce for the noodles was just 'flat' and had very little taste dimension to it.  It tasted like a tomato based pre-made sauce. ick.  The texture and the entire meal as a whole looked like something I purchased from the frozen food section of the grocery. My 12 year old son (who normally loves drunken noodles said \\"ewe\\" when he saw the noodles and refused to eat a bite)  \\n\\nThe papaya salad had way too much fish sauce in it.  Never in my life have I ever not finished an order of papaya salad (I loooove papaya salad!) It was obvious that the salad is 'pre-made' ...what I mean by that is that they probably make a big container of it  and leave it in the fridge, as opposed to many places that toss the papaya ingredients together as you order it because the papaya gets soggy and salty if it marinates in the dressing for too long.  How would you feel being served a salad that had been tossed in dressing and refrigerated for 2 days?  Blech.\\n\\nI order drunken noodles at least once a week but I decided to try Buddha Cafe because it's close to my home and I didn't feel like driving to my usual Thai place on the hill. I can definitely say that I'll never go back because the food was just absolutely terrible."},{"name":"The Copper Rocket","address":"106 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"I stopped in because it was featured on Bar Rescue but found it has new owners since than.

Probably my expectations were too high. I was hoping for transcendent and got just fine.\\n\\nI had been thinking that my companions and I would go in for a tasting menu, but we were all exhausted and didn't think we could do 6 courses, so we just did the pre-fixe. I was in a weird mood and ordered two things I never order-- soup (pumpkin) and chicken (stuffed with chicken sausage).\\n\\nBut before I go any further about the menu or the food, I need to say this: the bread basket is so perfunctory/terrible that I wish they just hadn't brought any bread. I mean, the bread was COLD, colder than room temp.  And not baked on the premises, I'm pretty sure. The butter was also too cold to be spreadable.  Look, I don't advocate filling up on bread before what is meant to be an amazing meal, but I just found it strange that Craigie wouldn't try to do something to make the bread not suck so much. The bread basket made the statement that no one should care about the bread basket. It was a mockery of bread baskets and diners who love their free bread.  \\n\\nNow that that tangent is out of the way, here's how the rest of the food went down: pumpkin soup was good, but not amazing. Came with a delicious sliver of grilled cheese and pork belly panini.  It was served with a comically large spoon. Friends got fusilli with confit chicken and veg and the smelts. No rave reviews on either -- but no complaints.  My chicken was very tender and obviously high quality meat -- but there was very little sausage, like a small \\"ribbon\\" of it through the breast. And it just wasn't that flavorful. I did taste my friend's swordfish and thought it was very good -- I probably should have gotten either pork or fish. \\n\\nWe also shared a side of brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat. They were tasty and I love b sprouts, but I couldn't really detect the duck fat flavor....which I thought was what was going to make them special/memorable. They smelled amazing, though. \\n\\nMy panna cotta for dessert was excellent -- light but creamy, and the granola gave it a nice crunch.  \\n\\nAll in all, nothing was bad, but nothing was stellar. And for what you're paying, it should be stellar."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We went here a couple weekends again and let me just say.....I AM IN LOVE!

This place is definitely worth checking out. I've been here a couple times now, and had a good experience both times. \\n\\nDRINKS: \\n\\n-If you love beer, you will love it here. I haven't seen a bigger beer selection anywhere else. Their beer list goes on for pages and pages. I like drinking, but don't really know a whole lot about beer so I found the extensive menu a little intimidating. I do have to admit that's not a bad dilemma to have though! One neat thing I really liked is that next to each food item on the menu, they have a suggested beer pairing. This made it easy for me, as I just ordered what was listed with my entr√©e! :) \\n\\n-If beer isn't your thing, they also have cocktails. The first time I came here, I tried some of the Pink Unicorn cocktail ($8.50/pint) that my mom ordered off the Featured Cocktails menu for that night. I can't remember all the ingredients, but I know it had cucumber infused gin and strawberry syrup in it. It was amazingly delicious and I was super impressed. One my second visit, I was so excited to order it again, but that time it was nowhere near as good and I was so disappointed. Oh well. \\n\\nFOOD: \\n\\n-Goat Cheese Fritters ($6.75): I thought these were sooo good. Nobody else at the table seemed as enthused as I was, but I really liked them! They put a little bit of honey on the plate, and then place the fritters on top. I thought that was a pretty unique combo. I wouldn't have expected to love it, but I did! \\n\\n-Salt and Vinegar Popcorn ($4.50): I was pretty stoked when someone in our party ordered this. I had wanted to try it to see what the hype was all about, but couldn't bring myself to order popcorn at a restaurant. Don't let that stop you though, because this is good! Very tangy and flavorful! You get a lot for $4.50, so it's great for sharing. \\n\\n-Belgian Fries ($5): The fries have a pretty good flavor on their own, but paired with the charred onion mayo makes it sooo good! \\n\\n-Duck Confit Banh Mi ($12.75): I asked our server to help me choose between Shrimp and Grits or this, and she said she liked this better. Yes, it's pricy for a Banh Mi. And it's not that big. But, I did like it & it tasted pretty good! The duck had a good flavor, and the pickled vegetables on top were good, too. \\n\\n-Mac n Cheese ($6.75): It's Mac n Cheese. Yummy and cheesy. It's not super spectacular or anything, but I did think it was good. If Mac n Cheese is your thing, you'll like it. \\n\\n-Fish n Chips ($11.50): The fish they serve is catfish. I only tried a couple bites of this. It was okay, but I thought the fish was a little too salty.

No frills in terms of decor, not open late despite the fact that most people go to the North End for dinner and would want to stop by at about 9pm, and occasionally ornery service depending on who's working the counter.\\n\\nThat said, they make the best cannoli in the North End, and after having gone to Maria's several times in the past year, I'd never again go to Mike's or Modern.  Those places are for tourists, and I'm so happy not to wait in their lines and experience their pre-made, soggy cannolis.  I'm hesitant to even write this review as I'm worried that one day people will catch on to how amazing Maria's is, but I have to give them their due.  Maria's does Italian pastries to perfection, end of story.\\n\\nI usually make an attempt to come here when I'm in the North End, and it's almost always relatively empty.  They don't have much seating, and it's far more conducive to take-out.  I love the cannolis (in case I didn't already make that clear).  They're filled with ricotta to order, unlike Mike's, where they're pre-filled hours earlier and who knows that the quality is once you leave.  I've had their pizelle which is excellent (both almond and anise), and on my girlfriend's birthday, Maria's cousin personally delivered a tiramisu cake to my place in the South End at the end of her workday.  Just unbelievable customer service there.\\n\\nIn summary, while it's a fairly old school place in terms of decor and service, I'm honestly glad that they focus their effort on the baked goods.

He also rushed everyone to order by saying he didn't know when but the kitchen would close soon. He was also very unaccommodating by telling us the upstairs bar was closed when some of us ordered drinks. We ordered a caesar salad, hummus plate, side of mac n cheese. I cannot tell you how disgusting the caesar salad was, do not order that. On the other end of the spectrum the macaroni and cheese is pretty delicious. Finally, the hummus plate was pretty basic. Another person in our party ordered BBQ something and the portion was so small it was embarrassing.

As we were the only two people in the store at the time, he explained the dishes we were eating, like why people in Nepal use certain ingredients or why the dish was a cultural staple. He recommended that we try the lemon soda with ginger, a drink that he makes himself and even drinks everyday! (It smells like egg but it tastes really good & apparently it's great for digestion.)\\n\\nThe momos reminded me of a cross between Chinese & Indian cuisine. They were homemade and fresh! The bara with alu dum, however, was my favourite. It's like a lentil pancake with potato curry on the side.

We are Caucasian but have very diverse tastes. We love trying different ethnic restaurants and love spicy food.  Upon reading the reviews for Hong Kong House, we were interested in eating here, many of the things on the menu sounded good. \\n\\nWhen we walked in, there was no one to seat us right away so i grabbed a to-go menu from the hostess stand and started looking at it.  Then the hostess arrived to seat us and I stuck the to-go menu in my purse.  We were seated and given menus, each of us ordering an item that had a pepper next to it which indicated that it was spicy.  None of our meals were spicy, they were all bland. One of my coworkers ordered a broth with beef and noodles and said that it tasted like water.  We were all really unhappy with our meals and left most of our food.  We didnt complain, we just figured that the restaurant wasnt for us, that it actually wasnt that authentic of a restaurant after all.  The waiter also did not question why we left so much food, didnt ask if we had liked it or not.\\n\\nAfter I got home, i was describing my dining experience to my boyfriend and I showed him the to-go menu and we noticed that there was an entire section of the menu that was not on the dine-in menu that my coworkers and I had received.  These dishes were all numbered and had Chinese characters next to their names.  It was obviously the 'authentic' menu and we Caucasians were given the 'Americanized' menu. \\n\\nI was discussing this with a friend who is Chinese and she told me that that was exactly what had happened.  That when she dines, she receives the 'authentic' menu and that they dumbed down the spices in our dishes, thinking that we probably didnt like spice.  \\n\\nThis really angered me that we were basically DISCRIMINATED against. We were not offered the 'authentic' menu or asked what spice level we preferred.  We basically wasted our money, where if we had been treated fairly, we would have ordered things that would have probably pleased us.  My boyfriend suggested that we go back and specifically ask for the Chinese menu; however, I'm not sure that I want to give this restaurant any more of my money.\\n\\n--Update -- I was actually so irritated after writing this review that I called the restaurant and asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager was not there but I could leave a message. I asked when the manager would be in and that I'd just call back then. The woman told me she didn't know when the manager was available. I asked his name and she told me \\"Joe.\\" I asked for a last name and she said she did not know his last name. I responded, \\"you do not know your own manager's last name?\\" She said no, she did not. What a shady place! Most restaurants post their General Manager's name or business cards somewhere near the entrance/lobby. I asked if I could speak to whoever was in charge in the absence of the manager. I was seriously told that there was no one in charge. I said to the woman, \\"so if someone was dining in right now and had an issue, who would they talk to?\\" She told me I they could talk to her. So I said ok and told her about my dining experience. She admitted that the servers will tell the cooks if a table is American and they will not add spice to the food. I told her that was discrimination to assume things about a race. We should have been asked our spice level and we should have been offered the Chinese menu and treated just the same as their Asian customers. All she could do was apologize. When I asked, she said she could not offer me a make-up visit or anything free but she could have her manager call me.

Do not be afraid to try everything, go out of your comfort zone because you will not regret it.  Every dish we had was a flavor bomb of deliciousness and pure joy.

Did you miss me?  \\n\\nA colleague and I were in desperate need of solace from \\"Convention People\\", so she narrowed our choices to here and some joint with the word \\"sloppy\\" in the title.\\n\\nWe chose well.\\n\\nIt looked like the line was huge but we were immediately seated at a 4-top in the back, overlooking the water.\\n\\nWINNING!\\n\\nOur server was busty and sweet and funny and had big tatas and made us feel comfortable right away and had cleavage for miles and made great recommendations for appetizers.  Did I mention she was stacked? No, really one of THE best servers I've ever had. Especially on a late Monday night when a convention has melted all over the city. (Thanks, Janelle!!). \\n\\nWith her blessing, we ordered a pitcher of the Cadillac Margarita. My colleague asked if I was sure we could finish a whole pitcher and, after the day we had, I told her I'd be shocked if we didn't finish TWO-- which turned out to be a total bluff, we barely made it halfway through. (Seriously, it was like someone was refilling it while we weren't looking).  I typically prefer my margaritas a little sweeter, so I think a little Chambord would have been tastier...but I wouldn't kick the Cadillac out of bed.\\n\\nI ordered the short rib app that was on special and the Pollo Al Carbon entree, mainly because I had a hankering for  plantains.  Before we got to eat a guy asked if we wouldn't mind switching to a smaller table so he could sit with his 7 clients (effing Convention People).  But Janelle stepped in and ran interference. We decided to move and Convention Boy bought our pitcher.\\n\\nDOUBLE WINNING!\\n\\nThe manager comes out with the most sincerest apology that the special app I ordered had run out so he gave us a complimentary empanadas.\\n\\nEVEN CHARLIE SHEEN ISN'T WINNING THIS HARD!\\n\\nNeedless to say, the food was great-- Empanadas crispy without being fried within an inch of its life, plantains warm and sweet, chicken was light with the perfect amount of cilantro. Yum!\\n\\nWe thought our night couldn't get any more perfect...then the DJ started spinning old school 80s and 90s songs that had even the Crotchety Convention People at our sacrificed table tapping their sensible shoes.

The star here is the rotisserie chicken, which you can see turning through a window to a part of the kitchen. It has a delectable blend of spices on the skin and the meat is deliciously tender. The rotisserie chicken is served with a garlic based white sauce and/ or a jalape√±o green sauce. The sides offered are yuca, green plantains, or ripe plantains. If you are unsure of what these three are I would compare yuca to potato, green plantains to a slightly sweet chip, and ripe plantains to  caramelized bananas (I prefer the green plantains).\\n\\nI also tried the chicken soup which was great- there is some assembly required.

With 18 of their coveted burgers make a day I didn't want to take a chance. You can reserve via open table and I believe they have a late cancellation fee if it's less than 24 hours. \\n\\nAs mentioned above, I didn't want to risk not getting a burger so I made a reservation for 6PM and thought even that would be late. Luckily for us, the random Wednesday night we went the staff at the front said it was a slow day of them and usually people are waiting out front. SCORE.\\n\\nWhat I didn't know what that the secret (not so secret anymore as it's on their menu) was only available at the bar area so if you want it you'll need to head on over to the right side of the restaurant. \\n\\n| SERVICE | 5/5\\n\\nOur server was super friendly and attentive. He was knowledgeable about the menu/specials and had great recommendations for drinks based on the base we wanted. All the staff was really great though ensuring that our table was kept clean and our cups full.\\n\\n| FOOD | 4/5\\n\\nAs for the menu you can do their tasting option for dinner or order a la carte which was nice. \\n\\nWe ended up doing family style which I enjoyed. The staff was kind enough to make sure even our burger was easy to share with the different condiments. \\n\\n+ Secret Burger - the must awaited burger and I'm not going to lie it was good, but were my expectations maybe a bit to high for this one? Sure. Don't get me wrong I thought the burger patty itself was delicious and the meat did the talking. It was nice and juicy but I don't think the bread held up well with all the juices. I know, what a good problem to have... but by the last bite it got a little mushy for me. Steak fries were cooked great with a nice crisp coating but fluffy inside. The mace ketchup is a fan favorite and now I know why. \\n\\n+ Bluefish Tails - When in Boston order Bluefish. I have never really ordered anything like this before but it was a table favorite. The skin was crisp and the fish tail meat was flaky. \\n\\n+ Crispy Ribs  - Not what I was expecting when we ordered the dish but I was pleasantly surprised. When I think of ribs I think more saucy but they did a nice twist with this by making them smaller cut pieces of pork spare ribs that they fried and paired with a side of something pickled. YUM. They were flavorful and somewhat reminded me of korean fried chicken. \\n\\n+ Hanger Steak & Braised oxtail - Loved the roasted veggies cooked in fat. Like what could be better am I right? Portions here are a bit smaller but the quality of the meat was great and was cooked perfectly medium.\\n\\nAs for a drink, I really enjoyed the Jungle Bird I got which was nice a fruity but also had a kick. \\n\\n| OVERALL | \\n\\nAll in all, I can see why Craigie is a favorite in town and why folks wait in line before opening for this place.

It's pretty tiny, casual, and loud when crowded. \\n   We arrived to find a line out the door at 6:15pm on a Saturday night. Even in the rain, we decided to stick it out and see it through. We had a feeling it would be worth it. And we were right. \\n   The line would move up from time to time and once we got closer, a woman would come out and ask how many were in your party and to please form a single file line. We joked around that she was very strict, because she was. Maybe that was part of the charm here? \\n   We finally found our way inside after an hour. We sat where she told us to. It was right next to the very loud and busy kitchen. So loud in fact it was difficult to talk at times. Also, the place had so much hustle and bustle that for me, it was difficult to relax at first. \\n   We ordered our drinks and they immediately wanted to take our meal order. I realize they have a line out the door but I don't like to be rushed. But with their huge popularity I guess they don't have to worry so much about stuff like that. \\n   So we ordered the Caesar salad, chicken parmigiana, lobster ravioli and a spicy fusilli pasta with lobster and shrimp. Everyone at the table agreed the food was absolutely some of the BEST Italian we had ever had. And we hardly ever say that.

The service was extremely courteous and cheery but really, really, really s-l-o-w.  Had the five-course tasting menu for $85.  With the exception of the final entree--a seared duck breast with\\nfoie gras --each course was literally 2 or 3 bites.  But the whole meal took literally two hours--almost as if they thought the meal would feel more substantial if the dishes were spaced apart by 20-30 minutes.  The wait was excessive, to the point where I felt bored and impatient by meal's end.  Ideally, each item in a tasting menu should make a subtle gesture to the previous and succeeding courses, either by texture, presentation, flavor or ingredient.  However, with the excessive wait between courses, the continuity between dishes was lost, the courses became somewhat disjointed, and the composition of the meal as a whole was lost.\\n\\nThe menu began with hamachi complemented with lime, ruby grapefruit, and avacado.  The idea was laudable, but the citrus lover powered the hamachi a bit.  The second course was a julienne with fermented Serrano ham, treviso (chicory), hazelnut and Parmesan.  The fermented ham made for a really unusual and frankly delicious backdrop.  I have not had this before, or at least not in this way.  It reminded me of one of my mother's tradition Chinese dishes with fermented vegetables.  The third wish was a conchiglie ragu with wood ear (?) mushroom and Parmesan, which was delicious and deceptively rich and substantive.  It had the texture and flavor of Veronese horse meat, though I am sure it was not.  The fourth course was sumptuous seared duck breast with a decadent foie gras.  There was a fifth dish, but that seems so long ago....  I'm sure I'll remember sometime after hitting the \\"post\\" button on this review.\\n\\nI've had two or three -hour tasting menus before (Gary Danko, Bouley, Daniel, Le Bernardin, Saison, etc), but those were substantive, carefully orchestrated 9-10 -course events.  This one just went on and on and on and with really not much food and not much continuity.\\n\\nStill though the food was enjoyable, each course thoughtfully composed and carefully crafted.  I would return but rather than order the tasting menu would go a la carte, which, judging from other tables right and left, seemed to make for a livelier more efficient dining experience."},{"name":"Ki isu","address":"1532 Marine Drive","city":"West Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Excellent miso soup and ebi sunomono.

For no reason other than a long-running curiosity. As far as I can tell from other people's explanations, about 98% of Portlanders are hipsters. But of course NONE of them are. One of the codes of oath for the Hipster Clan is to never... ever... admit to being a hipster. I don't know which is more elusive in the NW: the true identity of these hipsters, or Sasquatch.\\n\\nNonetheless, there's a good chance many of the patrons I saw (or half saw through the dim lighting) were in fact hipsters. During my forty-five minute stay, my inventory consisted of: 8 funky hats, 6 heads dyed with Manic panic, 9 pairs of skinny pants, and 46 cases of other random weirdness. Hey, that's Portland for ya. And even if they were hipsters, who effing cares? They were smiling and friendly, shared menus, gleefully threw ice cubes at the bartenders, and shared their emphatic opinions of Tube's off-the-wall food items.\\n\\nThat time of day that I hold so dear to my heart, which many call Happy Hour, expands from 5pm-10pm nightly here. During this time, you can divulge in a sickening amount of $2 tall boys and $2 wells. The bartenders make a stiff drink and they make a mess while doing so. I love me a messy bar tender. The food is both vegan and omnivore-friendly. So nonvegans, quit your bickerin'. They have something amusingly named Professor Nanotear's Muffin: vegan ham, vegan cheese, and chipotle dressing, all crammed between an english muffin.

Full disclosure -I am still not a Mexican expert, but I do believe Acitron offers some pretty decent quality Mexican food.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small and tables are close together. You will hear every word of your neighbors conversation.  I value my privacy and space so this type of layout is not ideal for me.

The restaurant did fill up quickly during the next hour leaving some customers waiting by the door so plan accordingly. \\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet and friendly. She greeted us quickly and left us with chips and salsa as we studied the menu. The menu is divided by their brunch, lunch, and dinner options all available only within their appropriate time frame. The brunch menu looked fantastic and I made a mental note to plan a brunch date soon. I chose chicken tacos for my entree (Tinga Tacos) with two sides including rice and beans. The chicken was delicious. I was expecting the tacos to contain more toppings such as sour cream and cheese. Perhaps this is something I needed to request and again I am lacking a bit in the Mexican food knowledge department. Nevertheless I enjoyed my meal and grant Acitron four stars.

The calamari isn't the fried kind, it's just literally letting you know that it's squid.\\n\\n- Coquotte Moules Frites (29 CAD). Mussels, white wine, cream, bacon lardons. The side of thick-cut fries were just okay. They'd probably stay cripsier if they weren't served in a bowl, trapping condensation at the bottom. Tasty bacon bites and simple sauce enhanced the soft and juicy mussels. All my life, I strongly disliked mussels and their rubbery texture. It turns out that everywhere else I've ever given mussels a shot were overcooking them. Also note that we did not find a lot of sand in our mussels that night. \\n\\n- Macarons and sorbet. I'm not sure what specific dessert we ordered; it could have been a special for that night. Overall, it was a satisfying end to the meal even though no dessert item stood out in particular.

The crab cakes looked like minced meat golfballs. Now onto the main course. My bone on filet was cooked close to my liking but not GF's. It's not appropriate for me to have to wait to enjoy my steak while I have to wait for the kitchen to cook hers to her liking.

Not too creamy the way it should be. Heard they use a mix of half cream half milk. The potatoes  seemed to be all red potatoes with skin which held up better in the chowder. The homemade cracker was a nice touch. So good. Tried a tasting of oysters next. Moon shoal Barnstable, Mookie Blues from Damariscotta River, Maine and Little Guns from East Moriches, NY. Moon Shoal were just a mild good oyster. The Little Guns kicked it up a notch with more flavor kicking in but the Mookie Blues were my favorite. Hard to explain the combination of sweet seafood and that salty ocean flavor coming out in these.   Should've had a half dozen more! Last was the Tuna Crudo. A name after Italian paninis I love.

Probably took us a solid 10 min to get our orders in lol. Very pleased with the service aspect!! \\n\\nThe food is amazing as well. We ordered three things to share amongst three of us. The charcuterie boards are a must to order-- you can choose to add meats, cheese, and extra things with bread. I felt that it really completed the experience of dining at an Italian restaurant.

By the time our latte's were ready and our apple pie was placed on a warm plate, a table opened up by the window. The coffee is good, the latte's (which I usually just get coffee) are delicious and wow, the apple pie with cinnamon crumble on top is way beyond my expectation. The baked goods have been consistently delicious, but really, the apple pie--YUM.

Pokeatery gives you a LOT of options for toppings and mix ins, and have some unique choices as well. However, I find that their sauces and the overall bowl isn't as flavorful as other poke places I've tried. Their portions are pretty big, but I haven't figured out if it is worth the cost yet. The bowls are extremely Instagram picture worthy and aesthetic but the box layout makes it hard to mix in all of the components unlike a standard bowl.

The place is directly across the street from the Georgia Aquarium, which is where we wanted to go. The location was perfect for us since we wanted to stay in downtown Atlanta all day. We didn't know much about the parking because we took a Lyft there. From what I saw the front parking was tight. Maybe they have more parking in the back. \\n\\nThe restaurant is cozy with lots of seating. Just indoor seating, no outdoor seating. The place can accommodate for large groups or a couple people per table. We were greeted right when we got up to the door. We had a few bags on us since we came straight from the airport and our waiter immediately offered more chairs to hold our bags next to us. That was such a kind gesture. Our waiter was very attentive and constantly asked us if everything was good for us. He filled up our water and coffee every time he would pass by. We asked him to take a couple of pictures of us, he didn't even hesitate to do it. \\n\\nThe food was good. It was just what I expected going to Atlanta and looking for some authentic southern food. We ordered the Dirty Bird. It's offered at the restaurant but it's not on menu. If you're looking to get it, just ask your waiter! The fried chicken was just the right amount of crisp and tender. The chicken gravy sauce on top was so buttery it didn't make the waffle or chicken soggy at all. We also ordered a side of pancake to go along with our breakfast. The syrup was really sweet. I didn't care for the syrup too much because I don't like when things are too sweet.

Decent portions and generally healthy prep in comparison to standard restaurant fare.  Had the salmon salad, salmon main course, portabella burger, crusted cod, risotto ... Every dish a winner.

Bento boxes are must try for lunch (you can split into two meals or share). Bento boxes is basically a little bit of everything.

Yes, the ingredients are superior to most others', but certainly not worth this premium. Expect to spend more than $20 on the pizza alone! Pies are large enough to serve 2-3 people.\\n-Desserts are decent. Neither spectacular nor authentic, but pretty good.\\n-They also sell pre-made sauces, soups and pastas from a refrigerated case.\\n-Sopressata is exceedingly savory.\\n-Drink options are limited. Expensive, tiny bottles of sodas or waters, or water from the tap. Though a sign on the door clearly commands, \\"No outside beverages,\\" many bring bottles of wine with them.\\n-Seating is quite limited. There is one table, around which perhaps 10-12 may sit, as well as space for another 5-10 on stools, so you'll be sharing a table with other clientele. Keep that in mind if you have an aversion to Tech students, or to fedoras, facial hair and flip-flops, or those who sport such stylings... who might also be intoxicated and loudly discussing at length world affairs about which they know absolutely nothing beyond what Zooey Deschanel has told them to believe.\\n\\nOverall, 1/10 (score amended to reflect owner's treatment of employees and because Yelp removed my updated review)"},{"name":"MeeT in Yaletown","address":"1165 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Another Gem for Vegetarian eating in Vancouver.

We were celebrating two birthdays. We were waited on by Tracy, who seem to know quite a bit about the establishment, but she was very forgetful when it came to refilling drinks and bringing out everything that was asked for. My daughter and her boyfriend ended up sharing a drink because she never refilled her lemonade. Tracy would bring something to the table and left so quickly that if you had a question, you found yourself talking to whoever was listening because she was gone. Tracy was a bit too fast for herself.\\nI usually don't write a letter to a restaurant but I was totally taken aback by her behavior; may I also add that it was our first time at Rocco's Tacos. When the bill came my husband and I paid Tracy in cash, we left the table briefly to go to the restroom and when we came back to our table Tracy came and looked at me and said; \\"was my service good?\\" I stated \\"it was ok, was I supposed to write something on the comment card?\\" \\n\\" to which she said \\"I usually get an 18% to a 20% tip!\\" (she was obviously very angry and she had a very a nasty attitude when she approached me.) Tracy totally caught me off guard! I have never, ever come across a waitress/waiter that has approached me like that. I tip according to your service. Her service for us was mediocre. I gave her about 14 / 15% tip. There was no need for her to question me or my husband at all, never less front of a table full of people. Tracy never even gave us our receipt.\\nAs I was leaving I decided to go back in the restaurant and speak to a manager. Mr. Lorenzo Hernandez attended to me and I explained what happened. He listened and stated that he was surprised that she acted in such a manner since she's one of the servers that has been there from the beginning. He also stated that he would mention it to the GE Chipp Lewis and he would speak to Tracy. Mr. Hernandez proceeded by taking my name (Yolanda Rosado) he didn't ask for a number or anything. \\nI really hope that she doesn't do that any other customer and if she does I sure hope that she gets reported.

Truth be told, my first visit here was less than stellar. The owner and managers reached out to me to give them another shot after my critical Yelp review. I finally obliged on Saturday. The place was jammin as per usual but the manager Sean (who impressed my Latin hottie with his Castilian Spanish) got us a fantastic table in the middle of the restaurant. Our waitress was Sarah and she was fast, knowledgeable, and very personable. She started us  out with some killer Muscato which the wine steward came to our table to discuss briefly. I decided to really test these guys out by ordering six different tapas and every one of them was spot on!\\nOur hands down fav was the chorizo with figs in the balsamic reduction. Coming in Second were the chicken empanadas. They were cooked perfectly and the chicken filling was seasoned perfectly. Coming in a close third were the roasted veggies with a pimento sauce that made me almost lick the plate. The mushrooms swimming in a balsamic reduction with a dollop of goat cheese was delish. The olive tapas was really good since there were olives I have never seen nor tasted before. Finally the fish cheeks were good. But the pi√®ce de r√©sistance were the churros with dark chocolate dipping sauce...Hay Caramba were these bad boys good!\\nThe only negative part of the experience was the low class lady sitting beside me who kept complaining about how bland this dish or that dish was. One of the managers kept bending over backwards to make her happy and let her try different dishes. Most places would've have given up on her after the first complaint. Far be it from me to criticize anyone that complains but she seemed to be taking advantage of the good will of the establishment. Even after they didn't charge her for the dishes she wasn't happy with, she was very unappreciative.

Excellent. \\n \\nMoules-frites: mussels with white wine, butter, braised celery, leeks & coarse black pepper. A HUGE bowl of mussels arrived, piping hot, with the wonderful aroma of the flavourful broth. Mussels were fresh, medium sized, and not too many empty shell. The broth was wonderful, the perfect blend of all the ingredients...soaked into the mussels. This dish took some work though..and both my friend and I took a while to devour it all. It was truly mussel overload. \\n \\nLastly, dessert. I got the vanilla passionfruit parfait, with  lemon honey tuile. This was amazing!! The 'parfait' was more like a sorbet consistency, but the passionfruit flavour just jumps out. Not overly sour, probably with the aid of the vanilla, and every bite seemed to get better and better.

By the time our waiter got back to us to take our order we were ready to place the entirety of it - he cut us off after we told him our appetizers and said he'd take the rest of the order later and ran off.  I had to yell after him to get him to come back to take my drink order.  He didn't come back to take our main course orders until well after we had received our appetizers - consequence being we had to keep one of the large menus on with us while trying to arrange everything around it on the too small table for two.\\n\\n- The food is ok - but extremely overpriced.  I ordered the rigatoni gorgonzola.  While the pasta was cooked al dente, if there was any gorgonzola in the cream sauce or separate - I couldn't taste it.  So - $17 for a plate of rigatoni in a cream sauce with about an ounce of chopped pistachios on top?  No pasta, by itself, is worth that much.  Just ridiculously overpriced.

Located thirty minutes out of Austin and into the beginnings of the Hill Country, Driftwood is certainly that. However, the path there is not only beaten but paved and congested. I'm sure that when it opened in the 1960s the Salt Lick was that remote, hidden gem where college students made furtive pilgrimages. Those pilgrimages still occur, only now it has been discovered, by Food Network and all the rest. One Yelper aptly describes it as happening upon a massive family picnic out in the middle of nowhere. It's a hacienda of a restaurant with a sprawling outdoor patio for waiting, a store selling wine and beer, and a separate lodge for events. For the DFW crowd, this place is the Joe T. Garcia's of barbecue. The website says they serve some 2000 customers on any given Saturday. \\n\\nSome things haven't changed. They're cash-only, BYOB, and they don't take reservations (unless you have a large party). We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday, and the wait was already an hour. It's an efficient operation, though. The barbecue is of course prepared ahead of time, and the potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans, and pickles and onions pretty much come standard. It's no place for a vegetarian, though they do have turkey for the faint of heart. Also, there's cobbler for dessert. I was disappointed that they didn't have sweet tea. It's also more of a fork and knife affair rather than a butcher paper and Wonder Bread affair. That's not to say the brisket isn't incredibly tender (and flavorful). It's smoked for upwards of 20 hours and basted with a tomatoless barbecue sauce. I know that's heterodox on both counts for Texas barbecue, but it works well for them. I was plenty skeptical that the scale would cut into their quality, but I stand corrected. Nevertheless, the wait is a large opportunity cost, and I still prefer the small-scale charm of Lockhart."},{"name":"Lakeside Bar & Grill","address":"700 Bloom St","city":"Celebration","stars":"3.5","text":"We sat by the lake and enjoyed the outside.

The BBQ, as most people will tell you, is pretty good. The fresh bread is to die for. If you are a fan, try the homemade pecan pie; it is delicious.\\nCons: I expected the BBQ sauce to be better. I tried the mild and spicy versions; the spicy one was not much different from the mild and should have been much hotter. Also, I think that well-cooked green beans or some type of corn would be a good addition to the menu.\\nVegetarians: Ummm... you are out of luck. Just kidding; my girlfriend enjoyed the potato salad, beans, and blackberry cobbler.\\n\\nIt was quite a drive to make it out to the legendary Salt Lick BBQ all the way out in Driftwood. So, we decide to get up early and, on the way to Austin, stop by for lunch. The restaurant is nestled so far back on country roads, we thought we would never get there. When we did, we realize just what a big deal this place is. The parking lot was humongous! I think the lot served both the restaurant and the adjoining winery.\\n\\nThe building is historic and old, but nicely renovated. Inside are rows of benches and picnic tables... enough accommodate large groups and the lunch hour rush, though I can't imagine where the rush comes from since the Salt Lick is quite a way outside the city.\\n\\nVisiting for the first time, it took us a few minutes to get oriented and find our way across the large property to the restaurant. Though there are signs to lead you, I wish they would be more conspicuous and a bit larger for first-timers. We eventually found our way, walked into the dining establishment, and were promptly greeted. We were immediately taken to our seats by our friendly and attentive server and we soon ordered.\\n\\nI decided that I came here to try one of my very favorite things, so I ordered the brisket plate and my girlfriend got the vegetable plate. While waiting for our food, we were brought fresh bread topped with sesame seeds. It was outstanding. Upon receiving my plate, I noticed how the brisket was perfectly cooked. In my opinion, the brisket is the best I have tried at any BBQ place in Texas. I have been to some legendary brisket BBQ places including Rudy's, Black's BBQ, and City Market in Luling, but the brisket from Salt Lick topped them all. Unfortunately, where they came up short, in my opinion, is the sauce. While well-cooked brisket is good enough to eat plain, the sauce is in important accompaniment. Good  sauce is crucial to a good brisket. In this department, Salt Lick came up short.\\n\\nOther than the brisket, the side dishes are pretty good. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the beans. I thought the coleslaw was fresh and just a bit tangy, but the potato salad was just okay.\\n\\nAfter clearing our plates, we decided to take dessert to go; I ordered the pecan pie and my girlfriend asked for the blackberry cobbler. Both desserts were outstanding. In fact, if you drive all the way our to the Salt Lick, you must try them. You will not be disappointed.\\n\\nWhile the brisket was out of this world, the Salt Lick came up a little short in other important categories. The so-so sauce made me lament the long drive.

After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes without being acknowledged, I realized that, what at first seemed to be a \\"jolly\\" atmosphere was actually a highly unorganized level of chaos. The amount of cussing coming out of the staff's mouths was uncomfortable enough but after finally receiving our drink orders and food, I was overwhelmed by the amount of grease and general \\"gross\\" emanating around me.

I have heard from many individuals in Vancouver that this is their top choice for any meal any day since their opening.  Even though their menu has a good selection of trendy items, I have to say that there are other places in Vancouver that trump this restaurant.  \\n\\nNow, on to the really important stuff; FOOD!  Their mussels and fries are their signature item and come in a few different varieties.  I opted for the one with bacon lards and green onions.  Some may say that the price is a bit steep at $29 but the portion is quite large and more than enough for two people to share if you're feeling peckish.  You can't really go wrong with mussels so they did well in choosing properly sized mussels that were quite succulent and juicy.  The broth was mediocre but if you're a bacon fan then you'd really appreciate the copious amounts of pork in the broth.  The fries are perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They come with a creamy aioli on the side for the fries to have a dippable partner that manages to bring even more flavour to your mouth.  \\n\\nI decided to order a side of their cornbread (which is not on their menu but can be requested) since I'm a big cornbread fan and I do not regret it one bit.  It seems as though they cook it in a cast iron skillet because it has such a crispy side to it that really brings the texture that a cornbread connoisseur appreciates. The flavour isn't too sweet and the corn aspect is just the right amount. \\n\\nTheir ceasars come with their signature olive (after you have it, you'll want to order their olives and pistachios appie) and a cherry tomato on a cute toothpick and a long thin slice of a cucumber that soaks up the liquid and is great to munch on.  The ceasars are also spiced with harissa instead of horseradish which is quite a unique twist for this Belgian restaurant but it works.  \\n\\nThe belgian waffles are quite typical and not that unique from other restaurants serving the same style waffles but their sauces are quite special.  They have this decadent bacon caramel sauce which packs a punch with the smoky bacon flavour hitting your taste buds at the end.  Their white chocolate rosewater pistachio sauce is very appealing to the eyes as it has a pretty light green colour and is a treat for the nose as well with its pungent fragrant rosey smell.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere on the inside is very hip and historic where their patio exuberates LA vibes.  These two very different tones allow for Chambar to be fit for a very romantic date night or a fun lunch date with the girls."},{"name":"Pokeatery","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1410","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Second time trying Pokeatery and I have to give it to them... they give a pretty decent product out for a fair price.

Broken Cauldron, which is located on Church Street near OBT (a fairly sketchy area right now, but one that should be getting much better once the stadium is built), helped host the event and allowed people to use their restrooms and park in their lot, which was a very kind gesture on their part.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the actual venue itself, Broken Cauldron is a brewery (which you can see through some windows looking to the back) with a average size bar bar people to sit and hang out. While calling the bar small would be unfair, it does happen to be on the smaller side. However, what they don't have in size they make up for in fun design. They have a fun couch and lots of cool artwork all over the wall. There aren't very many televisions (I believe 2) in the bar, but they seem like a place focuses on having people try beer and hang out.\\n\\nTrying beer and hanging out is what my wife and I did that day. While they only had about 10-12 beers in total (all on tap), they did have an interesting 4oz/8oz/12oz system that lends itself to trying various types of beers. While our Yelp friends decided to get a 12oz pour of the Victory Kirsch Cherry Gose (solid choice still), my wife and I decided to essentially get a beer flight by ordering 4 4oz beers: the Cherry Gose, the Saltwater Sea Cow Milk Stout, the Crooked Can Belgium, and the Black Cauldron Barleywine.\\n\\nAfter tasting each one of the beers, we picked which ones we liked best and each finished 2. My wife finished the Cherry Gose (very good sour beer type) and the Belgium (typical solid Belgium). I finished the Milk Stout (a really solid stout that would have went great with food) and the Barleywine (which we both felt tasted absolutely terrible). While finishing the beers was fun, our two complaints about the place can be derived from our rankings. First, this place doesn't serve food. While it doesn't need to be a fully-service restaurant, the lack of other restaurants around it means they should at least offer a few snacks to go with your beer. Our second complaint was the Black Cauldron beer. Maybe it just wasn't in our wheelhouse, but it was by far the worst of our 4 beers. While I'm hopeful that the rest of their selection is much better, that awful aftertaste may make me think twice about trying their brand again.\\n\\nOverall, Broken Cauldron is a nice little brewery that is worth checking out if you are in the area. While their limited selection and rough location might prevent people from going over very often now, their generosity with the \\"Spread the Sparkle\\" event, cool varied ounce pour setup, and close proximity to the new stadium gives me hope that they will continue to get better and better in the months and years to come."},{"name":"Fairmount Grille","address":"81 Fairmount Ave","city":"Hyde Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was decent.

The restaurant setting was rather quaint and intimate. It was located in the basement level of a condo building. My husband and I went for the 4-course tasting menu - him the omnivore, and me the vegan. \\n\\nThe omnivore: The macaron appetizer was well balanced and tasted really good. 2nd course - mussels dish was briny yet felt like it was lacking a depth in flavor. The 3rd course, roast chicken was so-so. The dessert was a rich and decadent-looking chocolate cake (which unfortunately, my husband is not a fan of chocolate).\\n\\nMy vegan course started off with an amazing broccolini appetizer - it was really fresh and had a good balance of texture and taste. The second plate highlighted a giant grilled bok choy that was too large and fibrous to properly eat. I spent a good amount cutting the leafy green and chewing the bok choy, which could have been wilted a little bit more to help with the breakdown. I wanted a little bit more dressing to help with the taste and texture of the dish as all I tasted was char, bland, and fiber. The third was also rather disappointing and nothing to write home about. For the desert, the vegan cake, unfortunately, had a gritty, offputting texture while the cookies almost broke my teeth (though had good flavor).\\n\\nFor drinks: I had the Mint Condition - it was a delicious mix of minty sweetness and tart. He had the Wicklow, which was just as tasty.\\n\\nAs an overall, the four plates for the omnivore menu made more sense than the vegan menu. We were excited and dazzled at the beginning of the dinner service but left disappointed by the end of the meal. Service was good and the wait staff was attentive. Parking spaces were limited as most of the spots were not owned by the restaurant so we had to park farther away. The rating should be 2.5 stars but the system does not allow for that.

I don't know if tonight is a normally busy night. The line was out the door and it was raining outside as well. You see the dedication to Antico?! When I walked inside, there were barely any standing room available. It was super stuffy and hot in the back room where all the baking from the ovens were happening. All of the people and the hot events made the experience not as great as patrons were very aggressive in grabbing seats. I think that maybe the restaurant doesn't want to expand it's space because 1) no land or space to expand in the surrounding area as they barely have any parking spaces anyways 2) the small, knit restaurant that they have is part of their appeal. I think it would be more efficient for them to have a microphone to yell out numbers of when orders are ready than to have servers run around with large hot pans holding hot out-of-the-oven pizza screaming out order numbers. The pizzas do come out every three minutes or so and the turn over for tables are very quick. I just would rather them handle the seating situations than to have the patrons do it. You have guests that don't have any pizzas on their tables waiting while others are standing and looking for a table with their pizzas already done. Another thing to add, they allow for BYOB so don't forget to bring your own drinks or else you'd end up paying for pricey drinks. You can also catch up on any sports games while dining in as they do have TVs on. \\n\\nPIZZA: You can share each pizza among two to three people. After three people, I would suggest ordering another pizza as we did. \\n- Margherita D.O.P ($19): I thought the pizza was okay. It's how a margherita pizza should taste. You have large dollops of mozzarella cheese and basil on homemade pizza dough baked to perfection and is served hot and it's not oily or greasy at all. It's a must order for Margherita Pizza Lovers (like my boyfriend). \\n- San Gennaro ($22): I liked the San Gennaro way better than the Margherita D.O.P. I like more substances on my pizzas and this pizza had a fair amount of sausages, red peppers, and dollops of mozzarella cheese. I wasn't a huge fan of the red peppers so I picked those off. I would say that the San Gennaro pizza is one of their popular pizzas. I would order this again in the future. \\n\\nOverall, I think I will try to come during the weekdays if I'm dining in or if I must have Antico on a weekend night, I will do take out. I cannot handle how crowded this place gets. How packed it gets and the lack of parking is definitely a con to Antico. The next time I order a pizza, I would love to try their pizzas with prosciutto as a topping like the Capricciosa or Vesuvio."},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Plentiful, cheap sushi - got the chirashi and eel bento.

Not bad just OK."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3810 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"There are a few very personal foods in this worlds. Pizza, ramen, and burgers. There are more, but these three seem to be pretty prevalent in Portland's food scene. For some reason, said foods are incredibly polarizing. Different folks grew up with different ideas of what should be what and how things should be done. I've never seen anyone get all bent out of shape over whether a Denver omelet is \\"authentic\\" or \\"as good as you can get from any random place in NYC\\" or whatever. But for some reason, when it comes to the foods listed above, people get cray. \\n\\nWhy this throat clearing? Because of all the burger joints in PDX, I feel like Little Big Burger is one of the more polarizing. Micah Camden's local burger chain serves up 1/4lb burgers (for those raised on McDonald's, that's a quarter-pounder) on locally-made brioche buns with local cheese and organic veggies. A quarter-pounder with cheese will cost you $3.75. A large bag of fries lightly coated with truffle oil runs $2.75. A soda (with free refills while in-house) is $1.75. So for $6.50 you get a quarter pound burger on a brioche bun with organic veggies and local cheese (medium unless otherwise ordered) cooked to order and a whole bunch of fries. All this in a no-frills fast-food environment... that serves beer. \\n\\nI'm sold. \\n\\nHonestly, this is an answer to many a previously-unanswered question. If you want to get a decent burger in this town you're going to pay out the ass. Especially at a sit-down joint. Even Burgerville charges a lot for a burger and fries. And Burgerville's sustainable, local burger has nothing on this goodness. Add in fries that are crispy, golden, and trufflized and it's on. And for $6.50? That doesn't happen. It did 10 years ago, but if you haven't noticed, food prices have almost doubled in that time.\\n\\nI will admit that these burgers look small. The patties are thicker than your average 1/4lb burger and so they're not as wide around. That's the deceiving part. The buns are made to match this width. The first time I saw this I was a little disappointed. Then as I ate through these tasty little suckers I realized that there is a lot more in the package than meets the eye. \\n\\nI guess at first blush I can understand some folks being disappointed in this situation. However once I consider the quality of ingredients, that it's cooked to order, the overall price for the amount of food, and the fact that I really don't need to eat a 1/2lb burger, I do feel like it's not only a good deal but a tasty one at that. It's not the best burger in town, but for a fast food joint, I'd choose it over just about any other in PDX."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place was amazing!

The moment I opened the door it felt like I walked into a Murakami scene. Maybe it was the 60s jazz music playing or maybe it was the typical Japanese interior. Not gimmicky to make it feel Japanese, but truly Japanese. Tidy and organized, but yet with a very warm and welcoming feel. \\n\\nWe were welcomed by the warm smile of the hostess. Both times I've been here there was the same hostess and same chef, I assume they are a married couple who operate the restaurant together. While the wife lead us to our table, the husband was entertaining customers in the bar seats with his stories. \\n\\nWe ordered the homemade gyoza, karaage, assorted sushi, and cold soba that comes with tempura and paired this with a glass of umeshu. \\n\\nI really like the homemade gyoza. The saut√©ed outside gives it a crispy bite And adds depth to the flavor. Personally I wasn't a big fan of the karaage. I prefer my karaage juicy and tender whereas this one felt a bit like chicken jerky. However, my friend really liked it, so it really depends on your preference. The assorted sushi was good. The fish was fresh and we were served a good variety. We finished with the cold soba. This is one of my favorite summer dishes and didn't disappoint. The portion was quite large with the tempura added. The tempura was great. Fluffy but crunchy and the vegetables were well cooked. \\n\\nThe food is very decently priced considering the effort and detail is put in it. As the restaurant is not very large and not loud at all, it's a perfect place to catch up with someone or for a date night. \\n\\nTo me it's a surprise this place isn't busier. I would go here any day instead of waiting for over an hour at the sushi place at the other side of the street. The owners really make you feel like you are part of their family the moment you walk in. I would say, give Nakamura a try and you might be entertained by the stories of the chef or receive a warm smile of the hostess."},{"name":"Tamarind Indian Cuisine","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 149","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my favorite restaurant for Indian Cuisine.  \\nI'm a Brookyn Girl that traveled to Jackson Heights, Queens to get my foodie on.  \\nDriving to Tamarind on N Orlando Ave from my Home always reminds me of that drive to Jackson Heights.  \\nAs soon as you open the door at Tamarind the aromas take you to India.  \\nThey have an excellent menu.

From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. \\n\\nWhen we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. \\n\\nUsually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, \\"yes! Let's toast\\" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups.

For my friends on restrictive diets, it can be hard to find something substantive on the menu. \\n\\nThe set-up can make it difficult to hear other diners at your table & the space can become tight rather quickly.

I visited Escobar for a night cap after an evening out with my lady. And for that reason I had low expectations for having an out of this world experience. With my low expectations I could observe and evaluate the reasons why some many Yelpers had low star ratings for the place. Note that my review is for the late night/club version and not the brunch, dinner or anything daytime.\\n\\nSet back #1 - drinks prices are high AF. My first crazy thought was maybe they import the liquor from France or something but I ordered Tito's and ginger and we all know good and dam well Tito's is made in Austin, TX. Then the cup they poured the drink in was no bigger than the cup you piss in for a urine sample completely full of ice.\\n\\nSet back #2 - place is small. To be fair, there is nothing wrong with a small place. But when you pack hundreds of people in the place, stuff changes. Then they dedicate almost a quarter of the space to \\"VIP\\" areas with massive couches while the rest of us who are spending money drink the same stuff VIP drinks smoke the same hookah and hear the same music. Go figure.\\n\\nSet back #3 - the struggle to buy a drink is real. That's nothing against the bartenders cause once they get an order they're quick. But navigating between all the bar loiterers and other people requesting drinks is tough.\\n\\nSet back #4 - this could be an extension of Set back #2 but there's no room to boogie. DJ is on point but once I gained a little momentum to dance, the best move I could do was head bob without knocking anybody over although I almost head butted the guy next to me.\\n\\nAfter sifting through all the setbacks, I can still positively say the establishment deserves 3-stars. Relative to other similar bars in the city, I've seen much worse than this. They had a good variety of options (hookah, food, drinks, music, VIP and etc) and a laid back mature millennial crowd. Not that I was searching but I saw some nice (looking) single ladies in the bldg as well. Suggest public transit, carpooling or ride-sharing cause parking may not be favorable or cheap.

It is worth every penny you spend there, and it's not even that expensive. Some things that are extremely good are the Lobster Raviolis and the Butternut Squash Ravioli. These are two of their most popular dishes so I would HIGHLY recommend at least trying it out on your first time at the restaurant.  But keep in mind, the raviolis are usually a smaller entree, but the cream sauces can get a little overwhelming so the smaller portion usually makes sense. This place is known for their homemade pasta, so make sure to get it no matter what! The calamari and caprese is always good as well.\\n\\nIn terms of service, DO NOT EXPECT HIGH QUALITY SERVICE. This does not mean that Giacomo's has horrible waiters (at least not all the time). People give this place 4-5 stars because of the food, not because of the service, why? It's because the food is THAT good that the restaurant doesn't need to be as concerned with high quality service because people WILL be coming in no matter what. \\n\\nHere are some tips to help prepare you for the next time you come into Giacomo's\\n- There WILL be a wait, unless your lucky. However, if you're a larger group, you might have to wait longer because they're trying to rush out the smaller tables. But in the end, the wait will be worth it.\\n- Be prepared with what you're going to order. The menu is outside so have it figured out, the only thing that might surprise you walking in are the specials but try to decide asap.\\n- DON'T GO HERE ON A FIRST DATE. Um, isn't it awkward having to wait online with your date for 2+ hours and then go inside to kinda actually start your date? Yeah, I would recommend coming back when you guys are a little more comfortable with one another.\\n- Bring cash, there's pretty much no restaurant in the North End that takes cash so be prepared.

Yes, fill up on bread here. \\n\\nWe ordered the wazanki (sauteed cabbage, kielbasa, potato noodles, and bacon, YUM!) and the Polish trio (stuffed cabbage, 2 pierogis, and kielbasa). It's a relatively limited menu, but there's a lot of choices, particularly with pierogi fillings and kielbasa (smoked or fresh).\\n\\nThere's also some house made desserts at the front. When we were there, there was chocolate raspberry torte, lemon mascarpone cake, apple strudel, and coconut peach cheesecake. \\n\\nYou can also purchase a dozen pierogis to cook at home, kielbasa, rye bread, and stuffed cabbage."},{"name":"Scratch","address":"149 A Ave","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been to Scratch twice in the past week.

My friend had the cabo chicken caesar salad (avocado, tortilla strips, black beans, corn, pesto) and a strawberry/banana smoothie.  I opted for the Popeye salad with grilled chicken (spinach, strawberries, cashews, goat cheese with balsamic dressing).  My friend's salad was very tasty, chicken very tender and dressing was great.  Mine was rather bland.  The chicken was dry and a bit overcooked.  Appeared to be prepared in advance elsewhere, didn't taste like it was just grilled or prepared.

My biggest issue was the overuse of SALT! Just for some background, I'm from NY and currently live in LA. I've been to some of the top restaurants w/ tasting menus (Eleven Madison, Le Bernardin, etc.) and go to lots of smaller, hole-in-the-wall places as well. I don't discriminate against price and ambience because flavor is what matters most to me. There are a lot of great Thai restaurants in LA and I also used to live in Pittsburgh where there is a huge Thai food scene. This was my first visit to Portland and first visit to Langbaan on 9/1/17. \\n\\nWe arrived early to PaaDee and the host let us sit in a booth before taking us to the hidden bookcase. Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating. I'm allergic to peanuts and they made sure to keep this in mind as well. \\n\\nThe first 3 courses were appetizers: shrimp w/ grapefruit, herbs, & betel leaf; scallop ceviche w/ coconut cream; deconstructed pork dumpling. These were FANTASTIC. Perfectly seasoned and wonderful flavor! These made me so excited for the rest of the meal. The timing between courses was also not too long, which I appreciate. \\n\\nFourth course was the soup course: dungeness crab w/ lychee, corn, cauliflower, chicken broth. I loved the lychee and crab combo but the broth was TOO SALTY. 5th and 6th courses: eggplant done 3 ways w/ shrimp, shallots, tomatoes; and, soy-marinated duck w/ figs, garlic, sesame leaves, arugula, scallion. The eggplant was interesting but I wasn't too fond of the eggplant pur√©e (too smokey). The duck itself was cooked perfect but the sauce was TOO SALTY. \\n\\nThe main course (3 dishes): Northern Thai style ground beef with lettuce wraps; squid w/ Thai chili vinaigrette; and, red curry w/ pork. The squid was okay....but it didn't taste that particularly special. The ground beef was TOO SALTY. Only one in my group actually ate this dish (but she likes food that is on the saltier side). The red curry was very disappointing. It barely had any real Thai curry flavor, and it was heavily over-salted. The pork in the curry was cooked well but we barely touched the actual curry. My other friend I was with had to stop eating cause of the salty issue. \\n\\nCourses 10 and 11 (desserts): coconut ash pudding and roasted banana ice cream. For a meal like this, I always prefer a lighter dessert since there was so much happening in the main dishes. These desserts were alright but were heavy. The coconut ash pudding consistency was more like jello than pudding. The ice cream flavor was okay but made me want more water rather than refresh me. \\n\\nOverall, too much salt and the portions were too big for this kind of meal. For a tasting menu/10+ course meal, the goal is to create portions that provide great flavor but allow room to try all sorts of dishes. The portions here were very generous for the price point but my friends and I couldn't finish. We wish we ate at PaaDee instead."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Place is beautifully decorated, the margaritas are amazing as well as the food and service will definitely recommend and will be back soon!"},{"name":"Bamboo Sushi","address":"836 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food comes out slowly, but when it does come out, be prepared to get blow away by it! \\n\\nI recommend the green machine with albacore tuna! 10/10!!!"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"When I was little, one of my foster mothers would sing a song, and one of the lines was \\"Los pulloelos con el pio, pio, pio, pio, pi.\\" So when I saw the restaurant Pio Pio on vacation, I knew I had to stop.

We discussed the menu and figured out a strategic plan to make this dinner affordable since the prices are higher than usual for pasta dishes.\\n\\nFor starters, I ordered a glass of red sparkling wine and hubby ordered a beer. I believe my glass was nothing short of 8 ounces - definitely worth it as the waitress described.\\n\\nWe ordered antipasti: cauliflower polpette, spicy mussels, marinated mushrooms, & marinated carrots. The cauliflower was cooked perfectly with a golden brown color. Spicy mussels had the right about of kick and also cooked perfectly. The mushrooms and carrots were a bit tangy for us. You can say it was marinated, you just don't know what it's marinated with until you take your first bite. If I had to guess I would say it was marinated in balsamic.\\n\\nFor our entrees, my husband ordered the Sole w/ lemon and I ordered the Tagliatelle w/ beef & pork ragu (whole). The portion for the Sole was impressive but not for the price. I took a bite of the Tagliatelle and consulted with friends if they tasted the same thing. I ended up sending my food back since it was too salty. As I waited for my food, everyone else finished theirs. Once I received my revised dish, it was perfect and devoured in 6 minutes.\\n\\nI most likely won't be back and it's honestly not a threat. Luce is just not for me or my wallet.

It's an hour long drive through narrow surface roads with no buildings or anything for as far as the eye could see. Make sure your car tank is full before you do the drive.\\n\\nThe restaurant seems like it is in the middle of nowhere and especially because we came here late in the night, we could hardly see the neighboring places.\\n\\nThe parking lot for this restaurant is huge! Freaking huge, actually. Enough space to build a runway here. I could envision bitterly long wait time if we had come any earlier. Since we reached 30 minutes prior to closing time, we got seated immediately.\\n\\nAs we entered the restaurant, the smell of the BBQ drifted down and further stimulated our hunger. I liked the rustic ambiance with lights. We ordered a Brisket plate, Pork Ribs plate and the Rancher. The plates come with a side of mashed potatoes, cole slaw and beans. Onions and pickles available upon request.\\n\\nService was brisk. Food was served at our tables just within a few minutes. There are two different kind of sauces on each table and I liked them both. I loved the Brisket plate, Pork Ribs and the Sausage. Sooo delicious. The smoky BBQ flavor, ah, I get hungry when I even think about it now. My least favorite was the turkey.

I hopped on my phone to do a Yelp test and sure enough the ratings were through the roof. As a HUGE pizza fan I couldn't wait to get here so I can dive into the crusty, cheesy, deliciousness I read so much about. When we arrived, I was glad to see that the place had a parking lot in the back. The parking lot was packed but we were both able to find a spot. From the car, it looked like the line was really long but by the time we parked and walked up to the restaurant we realized there wasn't much of a wait. \\nWe went in and as always, asked the cashier what pizza she recommends. She recommended one that I can't seem to find on their online menu (maybe because I can't translate it). It had sausages and onions and some other things on it (I'll post a picture). We went with that and she gave us a number that they would call when the pizza was ready. We went around the other side of the restaurant to the spot that looks like a cafeteria. It was really hot in there... I guess it's because of the ovens or something. At the back of the cafeteria, all I saw were a bunch of what looked like magical, pizza elves flipping dough and spreading sauce. We sat at one of the benches and waited for our number to be called. The atmosphere had a very Italian feel which was nice. \\nThe pizza came out and it was piping hot. I grabbed a paper towel and we went to town. Overall, I think the pizza was pretty good. It wasn't great. I've had better at places like my favorite spot (The Pizza Man in Norcross). The ends of the crust were burnt and that made it difficult to eat. I was bothered by that because for the price we paid for the pizza ($22 plus tax) I wanted to make sure I devoured every last piece. The flavor was pretty good, not overpowering at all. There's a fix-ins station where they had hot chili oil and parmesan. That helped to enhance the flavor a little. \\nHere's the thing that made this place a 3 for me. I'm used to buying a whole pie and only being able to make it through 2 slices... maybe 3 if I push it. My friend and I were able to make it through the whole pie together and we even had room for dessert if we wanted. For $22, I felt like I paid for the experience versus the pizza itself.

Our server arrived a minute or two later (after my water glass had already been filled) and I ordered the fresh juice of the day - tons of veggies and fruit, and GINGER, which is what really sold it to me! \\n\\nThe juice was really delicious, but I have to say I was disappointed for the size. Carol arrived soon after, as I was deeply involved in checking out the menu!\\n\\nI ordered the soup du jour - a spicy curried roasted butternut squash with mint puree drizzled on top. It was spicier than I anticipated, which I loved, and was full of flavour. There were little chunks of roasted squash on top to provide some texture to what was a very smooth soup.\\n\\nFor my main course I had the lamb kofta with green bean tomato stew and labneh. This was packed with flavour, with lots of mint to complement the lamb (of which there was also a very good amount). The stew wasn't too heavy, but was very tasty, and I packed half of it up to take home because there was still dessert to go!\\n\\nWith my waffle I got the fig orange marmalade, which I found very sweet. I enjoyed the chunks of fig, and the bitterness of the orange rind (thank you for making an actual marmalade and not just a sweet jam!) but it was too sweet for me, overall.

What we came here for, right?\\nThe Diner Burger at the Albert made it on CL's top 20 burgers coming in at number 6. I will be honest, everyone that ordered this raved about it saying it was comparable to H&F. To me, if one burger is good, all the burgers should be good. They should all be prepared the same way. However, I was severely underwhelmed by the Albert Burger. The burger is served with 2 thin patties with pimento cheese, bacon, and onions (I opted out of the onions). The burger was pretty dry overall, despite having pimento cheese. The patties were thin so they're pretty much cooked to medium well/well done. I prefer my burgers medium rare/medium. The patty melt looked okay and I thought the brisket was actually really good. The meat was much juicer than the burger. \\n\\nAnother underwhelming thing about the menu were the sides. Everything seemed to be picked up premade from the grocery store. The fries tasted like frozen Ore Ida fries. The famous bacon cream corn, Green Giant canned corn heated up. There was debate about the Mac and cheese tasting like Easy Mac. I, personally, thought it was a step above the powdered cheese packet. The one winner for me were the baked beans. They reminded me of Chinese soybeans -- a little drier but packed some heat. \\n\\nTwo other floating dishes were the smoked wings and chili. Skip the chili, and maybe get the wings. I thought the wings did have a nice smoky flavor. Not the best wings, but they were fine. This chili was no where in my realm of chili.

It's another Chipotle box-of-things-your-way design, but all the ingredients are... ya know... good. Or at the very least foreign to this set-up.  \\n\\nWe're talking kimchi (the pickle Earth deserves), seaweed salad (if you didn't grow up with this in your mom's fridge then find a new mom), marinated peppers, wasabi, pickled ginger, edamame, crab salad, citrus kale... it's Premium Town, population: you. \\n\\nThen factor in your four (admittedly tiny) scoops of raw fish, sloshed around in a marinade (that they should honestly lighten up on... I wanna taste the fish!) You can try them all, but if you're just getting different varietals of tuna they'll all blend together unless you grew up on a boat. I'd recommend the ahi. \\n\\nThese are all very good-for-you ingredients, and the substantial box of food leaves you lighter than any salad at Chipotle could (not to bag on Chippy down the same block, but they're big boys they can take it). Plus you can eat it with chopsticks, perhaps the greatest utensil for mindful, dextrous eating of all time. \\n\\nBut remember, when you're living in Premium Town... you gotta pay rent. It's an easy 13 bucks a bowl, and that is the cost of basically two bowls at Chipotle. That's a significant difference, and it's that double-gross that is causing the great Poke Rush of 2018. Entrepreneurs across the country are shocked that Americans with booming stock portfolios and their kids with bank account blinders will shell out for a better product. \\n\\nBut they are.

But I'll write one anyway SO I CAN YELL AT YOU AND TELL YOU YOU NEED TO GET THEIR CALAMARI.\\n\\nIt's clear that Giacomo's doesn't give a crap about what you think about them. Their website is made on Blogspot and their service is curt, rude, and you're rushed out of the restaurant the minute you've paid your bill. Despite all this, we left so wonderfully in love with this place and swore that we would have to come here again.\\n\\nWe came here on a weekday night and ended up waiting around 20-30 minutes. They stuck us at the counter -- space was tight, but it was cool being able to see the chefs hard at work in the kitchen. We started off with the calamari, and it is hands down the best calamari I've ever had. I'm assuming everybody orders it so our order came out immediately and piping hot. The calamari's lightly breaded so it didn't have that weird fried gunk bad calamari always gets. Still, it was refreshingly crunchy and completely addicting. Get the $10 Large order -- you'll regret getting the small the moment you finish the last calamari. \\n\\nFor the entree, we got the butternut squash ravioli and the mussels over linguine with their giacomo sauce  ($15 and $14. respectively). The butternut squash ravioli came with a asparagus, prosciutto and a mascarpone sauce. We didn't really taste the prosciutto, which was alright since the squash did all the talking in the dish. The ravioli and the sauce had a sweetness to it, which was a great foil to our linguine with giacomo sauce (a creamy tomato sauce). We rotated between the two dishes for the whole meal and finished up the sauce tidily with the freshly baked bread provided to us.\\n\\nOverall, this place is well worth the wait.

A good selection of Anerican fare.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nWe split a buffalo chicken appetizer. 5 very small pieces of mildy spiced chicken. Not even cellary with it. Nothing to at all to write home about. Not even close as actually. Very disappointing.\\n\\nI along with one co-worker ordered the Fish-and-Chips. I asked Cat if it was a good portion and she mentioned \\"yes, it is as n 8 oz portion\\". The fish was really very good, but not at all sure it was 8 oz, I'd say close to 6 and I needed more. The \\"chips\\" were frozen and oil soaked frozen \\"potatoes\\" that this Irish American could have done without. Come on folks, peel the potatoes and give a better effort there. My other co-worker got the steak tips. When Cat put them in front of my co-worker I almost said \\"where are the rest of his steak tips\\", but I held my tongue. Come to find out, he thought the same exact thing. We are talking maybe 7 oz of tips.. maybe. We are also talking a $22 lunch plate. All in all the food was decent, but because of the price of what you get, not good is all I'll say. I also want to add that the diet coke I ordered was way off. I assume the carbonation broke or something because it was flat. I should have said something, but I did not (my bad).\\n\\nFinal Assessment \\nOverall, I give 2 stars because it was not worth what we paid. Not even close actually. $19 for a small order of fish and frozen fries. $22 for an extremely small plate of steak tips. Disappointed with the Phantom Gourmets assessment; not sure  where that came from. We wont be going back, mainly because of the cost of what you get what you paid for. This in my opinion is not a 2 $$ restaurant if you are paying $22 for a tiny plate of steak tips.

I guess our waiter picked on how we were annoyed over the horrible service he was giving us, he literally told us to tip him well if he had done a good job.

I got to the restaurant at 5:08 and told it was not ready and I would have to wait.  Not a big deal at all..  While I'm waiting an employee was there who was not actually working (he was in regular clothes but kept going behind the counter and talking).  He kept leaning over the counter typing on the computer and did not notice there was a guest waiting behind him in line.  The guy working the cashier did not even acknowledge her and it took someone else saying for him to get out of the way.  \\n\\nFast forward 25 minutes and she already has her food and I am still waiting.  They were not busy, just busy acting like immature employees who did not care about anything except yelling \\"Dude are you getting wasted tonight, I am!  I bought a bottle of whatever....\\"  I'm in my early 30's so it's not something I have never heard nor said, but you are working, you have guests in the restaurant, and in my opinion, it's just unprofessional.\\n\\nFinally, I asked if my food would be ready (I try and be a super patient person because I have worked in food service and know how it can be) and my order had been sitting there the whole time.  So I spent 30 minutes waiting for an online order that had the cashier been interested in doing his job, I could have left and never had to pay attention to the employees and what they were yelling behind the counter.\\n\\nI will say that when I did get my food, the one employee (who was not involved in any of the above as he came out from the back of the restaurant for the last five minutes I was there) and actually asked if I was still waiting, was nice, apologized and gave me a coupon.\\n\\nMy opinion, for what it is worth, employees should pay attention how they are acting because they are representing that place of business.

For our group of 11, we received 1 basket of chips. For real?  That lasted about 2 seconds. When we asked for more, it took a good 15 minutes to receive more chips, but sadly no salsa was brought. Ugh. 20 minutes after being at the restaurant we still didn't have waters and no one had taken our drink order. \\n\\nService was sparse the rest of the evening and er would have to ask for everything...nothing was brought to us on its own. \\n\\nThe menu is basically tex Mex with some fresh local fish mixed in.

Sunday morning my party of 2 stepped into Pambiche at around 10am and were seated within 10 minutes. That is impressive considering the size (I'd say it can seat a couple dozen or less) and the popularity of Pambiche. \\n\\nDespite the hectic atmosphere, service was very attentive and I never felt rushed. We started with a sampler of Cuban baked goods, which was a basket of about 10 different mini treats ($5). What a great way to get an idea of Cuban cuisine!\\n\\nThe menu is loaded with a ton of great looking dishes. It is your favorite breakfast ingredients- eggs, potatoes, beans, etc.- with a Cuban twist! It's a must-try for anyone who likes Creole or Mexican food. \\n\\nMy Huevo Cuba Veg plate ($8.50) came with two scambled eggs, mashed plantains with carmelized onions, three corn fritters, rice and black beans. Everything was delicious! Boyfriend tried the Cua Cua dish ($9) was also excellent- a mixture of meat, eggs, plantains, rice, beans and fresh avocado. Both plates included a small side of fresh fruit.\\n\\nEverything about Pambiche is welcoming. The food is comforting and well-prepared, the service is friendly and helpful, and the dining room is full of color and interesting paintings. \\n\\nI can't wait to return for dinner! :)"},{"name":"Bamboo Sushi","address":"836 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing rolls, fresh sushi.

My husband and I had been dying to try this place, but it's been booked solid for dinner service every time we've tried to make a reservation.  We decided to try it for lunch instead.\\n\\nRow 34 is nestled between the World Trade Center/Seaport area and the Financial District.  If you can't find on street parking there is a small lot behind it and a larger lot adjacent to it ($15/$17).  The decor is very open, modern, and inviting.  Simple but elegant with a sit down, stay awhile, and have some oysters and beer feel.  Noise level is slightly above average, but you can still converse easily with people at your table.\\n\\nThe servers are very friendly and happy to make recommendations.   They seem well versed on the menu and the wine and beer lists.  Beer isn't your standard list, there's a lot to choose from and depending on what you choose can be pricey.  They have a fairly good wine list, but only serve select wines by the glass.  \\n\\nThe raw bar, I'm told, is incredible.  They even bring you a checklist of sorts with your menu so you can check off what you want.  The oysters are served with a unique variety of sauces and are just off the boat fresh.\\n\\nThe main menu consists of a few very creative appetizers and standard fare such as a lobster roll, burger, fish sandwich, etc.  While the menu tries to think out of the box on some things, the execution misses the mark.  The spicy lobster tacos with mango salsa are a great example.  Not very spicy and the mango salsa overpowered the lobster.  I had the fish and chips and the batter was bland and wet.  WET.  Watery fish and chips.  There was a puddle on the table under the basket this was served in.  The chips were good and the coleslaw was some of the best I've ever tasted.  More coleslaw please, the cup was tiny.  What a shame because the fish was really fresh and the sogginess just ruined the dish.\\n\\nBottom line, the raw bar is great but the other items need some work.  Maybe it was just an off day.  I was really surprised since the reviews for this place are so good.  Would love to try it again, but dropping a Ben Franklin on a lunch that might or might not be good isn't something I can do every day."},{"name":"Fufu Pancake Cafe","address":"1266 West Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"The matcha souffle pancakes were really fluffy, but they were pretty expensive for 2 pieces of pancakes, see mochi balls, and a scoop of ice cream.
