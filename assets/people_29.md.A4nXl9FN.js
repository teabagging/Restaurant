All the bartenders I dealt with were helpful. \\n\\nThe menu has basically everything, Fish, Chicken, Soups, Salads, Beef, Lamb, Pork, Seafood, Rice, Noodles, and Vegetables. If you can find at least one thing, then I don't know what to tell you. The prices are a little high, especially the seafood, but I didn't think it was ridiculous. You get a good amount of food and should leave with a full stomach. You have main dishes and small plates to choose from. Small plates is basically appetizer. I opted for the small plates and I got two different ones. Both of them were delicious!!! I've loved Asian Fusion Restaurants before I ever knew what the hell Asian Fusion was. \\n\\nThe lower level of the restaurant is very intimate. They have a booth with a curtain type thing that you could pull for privacy. The have the seating arranged in a manner for a group of people to socialize. They also have another TV down there along with a small bar.

This might be better than any cannoli I've had in Italy. \\n\\nAnytime you order a cannoli, she fills as many as you want and sends you on your way.  This is how it should be done.  The biggest flaw with cannolis, is that the crust gets soggy because they make them in the morning and they're sitting out all day.  Maria waits for you to come to her, and then she makes them.  This makes all the difference in the world.  Don't get me started on the exquisite taste that the ricotta filling brings to the table.  It's something you have to just experience for yourself.\\n\\nIf you're not looking for a crazy sugar high, the sfogiatella is the way to go.  Like the cannoli, I don't think I've ever had one that's such a masterpiece.  The crispiness of the outer crust is executed so perfectly, it makes me want to cry.  The subtle sweetness of the pastry itself, is expertly accomplished.\\n\\nAs for the other cookies, they're good, of course, (this is Maria's we're talking about here) but I can't imagine a situation in which I would go back there and get anything but the two options that I have just described.

It's classic brick oven.  There is ample street parking plus a small lot up front and a medium sized lot in back.  Despite there being a good 1/4 of the place empty, the lots were full, which surprised me.  Luckily, I got the last space.  You order at the counter (they have wine, some beer, and small soda bottles).  \\n\\nThe pies are not cheap at about 20 bucks a piece, and the menu selection is not huge, but it was good enough for me.  For my 4 year old son, I got the regular Margherita, and for myself I got the Lasagna (basically with meatballs and ricotta on top).  The pizzas are very tasty.  I'm a New Yorker.  I've had some of the best NY and Neapolitan brick oven pizzas, and the flavor here is right up there.  My only complaint would be that I asked specifically for the crusts to be extra well-done/crispy, and instead both came with slightly (just slightly) underdone crusts.  They were cooked but chewy rather than well done and crispy.  It should be possible to get it the way I asked, as the ovens are so hot and the dough so thin.  I also got one Sprite for my son and a Diet Coke for myself.  The bottles they have are barely enough to count as one drink.  I think they need bigger bottles for sale even if they cost more. \\n\\nThe decor is nice enough.  Trendy looking up front, with some backless bar stools around large tables (hope you like communal dining like you're at summer camp).  This makes the front seats no good for young children, as they can fall off.\\n\\nSo you go in the back section - the larger section.  And there are room long tables with long wood stools.  Everyone sits together.  This is also not much fun or comfortable if you are with a young child.  I only mention this, cause I have one, and I ended up realizing I should've just ordered to go since I had to watch him falling or knocking anything over the whole time and ended up taking all my pizza home to eat later.  \\n\\nThe only other problem I had with the seating in back was that it is Summer and humid as hell here in Hotlanta.  I'm not a local and am here for 2 months working.  It has been particularly humid, raining every day for the last 2 weeks off and on, but daily.  The back is where they make all the pizzas, and it is HOT.  I was simply sitting on the stool and felt the back of my knees sweating.  They need some major A/C or more powerful fans.  Or if nothing can be done, because it would throw off the ovens (which I doubt), then just know to get your pie to go.\\n\\nBottom line:  Good pizza.  Could have crispier crust.  Seating is not ideal for young kids at all.  Getting pies to go probably the best idea.  \\n\\nUPDATE: Either I got lactose intolerant in the last week or something in their pizza made me have the runs.  I had it a couple of days over the last 3 days and each time I got sick.

The menu had some delicious choices and I opted for an omelet with cheddar, spinach and chicken sausage, some home fries and a grilled English muffin. Approximately forty minutes later, our food arrived and I was appalled at what I was served. The cheese was not melted and they threw some uncooked spinach inside. I could easily open the omelet and clearly see that the adding of the spinach was an after-thought. They also forgot to add the chicken sausage. I told the waitress that my food was wrong and explained that they forgot the chicken sausage. She never apologized. She grabbed the plate from in front of me, brought it in the kitchen, and came back with the exact same omelet which had some cut up sausage thrown inside. At this point the omelet was cold, with unmelted cheese, uncooked spinach and luke warm sausage. The home fries were also cold and the English muffin wasn't grilled like I requested. So I once again gave back my meal.\\n\\nAt this point I was so upset that I didn't want anything else, so I sat there and watched my friends eat. I was very disappointed with my experience.

Being a large, gringo that loves Mexican cuisine and the affiliated spice, I was wonderfully impressed with this awesomely decorated restaurant. We started with a round of their least expensive, yet still expensive tequilas for the table ($9.50per shot). Midrange tequilas run on the average $19per shot. Our server Jon, (bad ass dreads. He's been there since opening), told us they have over 350 types of tequilas. Let's move on to my favorite part, the food! We ordered the table side guacamole. Forget Chili's, this is ridiculous, you can get it mild, medium, or hot. We also ordered the Jalape√±o Rellenos. You foodies out there know when you get a pre-breaded, frozen Jalape√±o popper app with a generic dipping sauce at some other restaurants, this is NOT that. Super fresh, handmade and stuffed with a cotija cheese, lime crema, comes with a homemade avocado ranch dipping sauce. It's so lightly fried you'll think it was baked. Probably one of my top 5 apps at any place! Kids dinners were as expected and good. Our dinner was really authentic Mexicano for sure. We did the Molcajete Surf and Turf (fajitas) for two. This delicious dish comes in a real Mexican stone bowl heated to 500 degrees. Shrimp, fish, steak, and chicken in a lightly spicy roasted garlic verde sauce.

The food was prompt.  The 8-9 dollar glasses of sangria aren't THAT pricey for what you get, I didn't think.  The amount of paella you get for 32 dollars is really not bad, all things considered.  \\n\\nNow, the paella:\\nIt's definitely not like any paella I saw with my in-laws in malaga or madrid - which may be better for most diners because they put a LOT more chorizo, chicken, and seafood in there.  Note - the chicken was tasty but somehow got dried out in that mix - not sure if it was added in but cooked too much beforehand (probably).  US diners probably would freak if there were chicken bones, I guess, as well, which would probably help retain moisture.  \\n\\nAnd they have different kinds of paella, which also I never saw in Spain, but I'm suspicious is valid in the way \\"NY\\" or \\"Chicago\\" pizza are different - and you'd never see those options on a US menu for pizza either - it's all geographic and the house makes only one kind.  But that's fine, this is America, afterall.  Now  I personally think that paella doesn't really work in a US restaurant anyway, because it needs too much time to cook and bake/burn the rice underneath (which wasnt burnt - arrgh!  key for paella! again, US diners might not like that)......so add all that up, what you probably get is probably closer to a non-spicy jambalaya.  That being said, what's wrong with jambalaya?\\n\\nThe decor is really cool, it's a tough, weird location, the wind sweeps through Kendall almost everyday (i work there) - it's rare to get a calm day, and the whole block needs to plant some more bushes or something to make that outside area really work.  but they are trying hard.\\n\\nThe only thing that bugs me about this place is - sorry,if you're spanish, the bread and little green olives (dont get cute with kalamata or anything) should be on the table.  No charge, make it happen.  And make the bread like what you'd get in spain.  It looked some kind of crusty iggys in a basket, which isn't bad, but come on, its not spain.  \\n\\nI'd give 3, but I'll bump to 4 because of the attentive waitress and the cool ambience.

Mmmm, City Hall Cakes, two generous, round flat cakes with banana and walnut goodness inside.  My husband's wrap was good, too, but the pickle that came with it was ironically disappointing.  Oh, and the \\"in a pickle\\" theme does show up in the menu's cute cartoony illustrations and in some pretty funny stories framed on the walls.

It was good, just not as fantastic as I expected.\\n\\nI tried the 8-course tasting menu.  I had to because... if one person at the table gets the tasting menu, everyone has to get it.  The reason was not clearly explained by the waitress, but I expect it's because it's hard for them to coordinate the timing when one person is getting 8 courses and others are getting 3. \\n\\nWe counted the courses.  Including the amuse bouche and the sorbet palate cleanser, there were nine (so I guess one of those doesn't count).  Presentation is lovely, portions are small. If you're hungry don't fool around with the six course version.  \\n\\nWhen they have to come up with 8 courses every day, selling the restaurant on novelty and what's fresh in the market, naturally not everything is going to be as successful as if they worked on each dish for a long time.  So that's the story here.  Some things on the tasting menu I liked (the stuffed cabbage, the pate and terrine, the sorbet), some things were mundane (the latkes), some things were more pretty than flavorful (cod with beets).  I can see the fun of the experience, but it's a lot to pay for the uneven quality. \\n\\nThere were pistachios on so many things for some reason.  Why? Are they currently in season in Massachusetts?  It is a very assertive nut, does not go with cabbage stuffed with lamb and rice and half the other stuff they tossed it on.  When it does work with the dish (rice pudding) it could be ground up a bit so it flavors every bite.  Anyway these are details that won't help you, as the tasting menu will obviously not be the same when you go there.  \\n\\nExtra praise for all the tableware.  I hate when servers put my old fork back on the table and expect me to use it for the next course, so I thought it was classy that Craigie gives me new silverware for each course.  We looked forward to the little ritual of setting silverware that happened each time, like an overture to the next course.   \\n\\nThe service was friendly, enthusiastic even.  (Our waitress said \\"Yay!\\" and did a little hop of happiness when we ordered the tasting menu).   But it was very slow, probably because they had to arrange each tiny leaf of microgreen on each teaspoon of condiment and so forth.  We started eating at a little before 8, and didn't finish until well after 10.  It only takes about 2 minutes to eat each course, and there's a good 10-15 minutes between courses while you're staring at an empty plate, so go with a good conversationalist and plenty of stories to tell!  \\n\\nOverall, not worth $360 for two, including two glasses of wine, one cocktail and tip.  (The bartending was good BTW.) I'm glad I went to experience it, but  probably would not go again unless everyone is briefed in advance about the tasting menu thing. I'd like to order a la carte and see what they can do with dishes that they've mastered.  \\n\\nAnd if that ever happens, I'll definitely update this review!  After all, maybe it's my fault, in a way, maybe I'm just not the type of customer that's right for the tasting menu approach, that person who likes to \\"put myself in the hands of the chef.\\"  I mean, I have to cook to please my family every day.

I tried their southern benedict, French toast breakfast tacos, and their fried green tomato BLT. My absolute favorite was their breakfast tacos, which had French toast styled tortillas, which I must say is genius and absolutely flavorful. I saw some of my neighbors also getting their peach cobbler French toast which looks super delicious! All in all, if I ever come back to Atlanta, I would definitely come back again.

The bar tender worked his butt off and was super nice to everyone. Very knowledgeable and tried to make everyone feel welcome. I absolutely hate to give two stars on such environment because I truly think it deserves 4.5. the reason why I'm doing two stars is because of the hostess. She ruined my entire experience here. She was very rude and cocky. I put my name down and told her I'll sit at the bar waiting for my friend. When the table was ready I informed her that my friend was still at the convention center and running about 20 mins late. She said she had to give the table to somebody else. I absolutely understand that. What I didn't appreciate was the tone of her voice and her cockiness. I was absolutely fine with her giving the table away as I don't expect them to hold it for long. But her attitude was horrible. I would not hire her to represent my business. I would return back here if I wasn't greeted by somebody like her. I think the staff here works very hard and it's sad to get low reviews because of one bad apple.

This is an example of the necessity for objectivity.  I suppose it's also a good example of honesty.  Let's face it, Cafe Yumm is in existence because of its \\"Yumm Sauce\\".  I've used that line on many a man before, but . . . wait, I am diverging from the story here.\\n\\nI wasn't a huge fan of the Yumm Sauce, but I recognized its intrinsic value.  For someone that doesn't have as picky of a palate as I do, it would probably be one of the best things ever.  I'm not saying my palate is of a higher quality, rather a lower one.  That is why it gets four stars instead of three.  The ingredients seemed of very high quality.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I disagree with a previous review that it was expensive.  The portions were a bit small (although that's my American view that has been beaten into me since I was young), but I felt just slightly underfed when leaving rather than way overfed.  I often leave feeling way too overfed, so it was nice to be closer to where I should be.  The prices were also not more than expected.\\n\\nI'll definitely go back.

Brunch place inside of a cozy bookstore? Yes please. Conveniently located as a 2 minute walk from the Hynes Convention T station, I trekked with my group of friends here for my birthday brunch. First of all this place is overrated. The ambiance itself is a somewhat drab, indie bookstore with dim cafeteria style lighting. On a hot summers' day we arrived around 11:15AM and the place was packed. We placed our names in and left our number. They would text us when the table would be ready.\\n\\nThe bookstore itself was crowded with patrons or just people perusing the books. We walked around the vicinity on Newbury St. to the Starbucks for some AC and the Japanese Anime store a few steps away. We waited for about 35 minutes before receiving a text the table was ready. We stood at the \\"wait here\\" area where we were rudely addressed by the staff interrogating whether we had even placed our name in. (Deja vu, this totally happened before when I was here with co-workers in the winter too.) \\n\\nThe five of us were crammed in one of their booths that was physically separating. There was also a huge dangerous gap on my end where you could lose your phone or small purse down an abyss. Our server split her time between 4 other tables and it was nearly impossible to get her attention without wildly flailing our arms around. We had to remind her repeatedly and she never delivered the cider drink one of my friends ordered. Oh well... At least she didn't really give us grief about splitting the checks 6 ways or me using a gift card.\\n\\nThe food itself was decent-good, nothing to write home about. I had the apple brie omelette and a pancake. The photos probably look more memorable than it tasted. Honestly any local diner would have been better. The awkward part was at the end of the meal when she swiped our cards she was hovering over us as we entered the tip since she had the mobile scanner. Who knows if she could actually see the amount?

There are many rides that maintain a less than 20 minute wait, but most of the popular ones will always keep a long line.  The parks are big enough to keep you busy if you can ride or see everything in one day in each park.

The best time to go is in late November and early December, or August/September right before Halloween Horror Nights.

If you do not want to read the gush of love that is about to follow- just keep in mind...awesome food from an owner that tries to grow his own food or at least get it locally, a beer list that makes you forget any and all unpleasant thoughts of responsibility (Let me just say- Bitches Brew on draft, two weeks after its release!!), and great staff that love food, beer, and good times.  You can go without the brownie topped with beer ice cream and caramel sauce.\\n\\nWe strolled through L5P trying to decide which place to try and I can feel that cranky hunger wave coming on as I fiercely scroll through the Yelp reviews-grumble growl.  I picked up the draft list and saw the newly released Dogfish Bitches Brew; the rest of the experience could have been a wash to me and I would not have cared. \\n\\nWe started with fried plantains with a habanero honey for dipping.  The plantains were not like the glutinous side dish I crave next to my favorite hangover cure- tamal en casuela at local Cuban diner (wait, I am not in Florida anymore...hmmm).   Back to The Porter's take on the plantain...starchy, but that was remedied by the sweet and spicy honey and I found myself appreciating its simplicity against the honey.  These little discs would have stayed on the plate if I did not have that honey, but that is the way some things go in life- they need a partner.  The plantain itself reminded me of how I expect to find southern, fried okra.  \\n\\nNext, we split a cheeseburger and fries. Personally, I like to see how places approach a pub staple.  If a burger gets as much attention as some of the more involved menu items I feel like there is some sort of love coming from the kitchen.  The burger made up for the small pitfalls of the plantain.  Not that I always want a big plate of food, but this was a monster on a plate half-filled with shoestring fries.  That burger... fresh pickles and pickled red onion (I could have had this as a side!!), with bacon and cheese on a fresh bun that was dense enough to hold up the stackings.  It made me mentally schedule my next trip to try other dishes.\\n\\nI loved that the waiter did not seem to have an issue with us splitting a meal.  Typically, I feel like they expect me to eat that extra 1000 calories for the extra $3 tip from another sandwich  (from one ex-server to the new generation- you will still get the tip, if you don't get the pissy impression that I am being cheap).  Our waiter was chill and he prompted just the right amount of conversation.  This is the first time I have had that type of really comforting experience here in Atlanta.  \\n\\nNow for dessert- I feel bad for saying anything negative because it was on the house, but as my husband will tell you I am a bad liar- even with the little ones.  I really wanted to get this dessert, but I was soo full that I didn't have any room left.  When the server brought it out- I found room. It was a fresh brownie lacking the requisite chewiness and density.  It was truly lighter than I would expect from a cupcake or sheet cake.  The beer-flavored ice cream was light and icy, just as I expected because of the beer; but its lightness is the only reason it paired with the brownie at all.  A creamier profile would have overwhelmed the cake.  As for the salted caramel sauce- in my book this could have made up for all of dessert's trouble.  Sadly, as the sauce cooled on top of the ice cream it became grainy and nothing turns me off of a food faster than an off texture.  Flavor- great salt/sweet ratio. The only thing I would not order again is this dessert.  Otherwise I plan to go back, often, for many reasons, and with an empty tummy."},{"name":"Acitron Cocina Mexicana","address":"473 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"4","text":"Don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews for this place. They likely come from people who either don't eat here often or who rate everything 5 stars no matter how good or bad it is. I've consistently patronized this place over the years and it is a solid 3.5 stars at best (4-5 for the food and 2-3 for the service).\\n\\nMy last trip to Acitron came about when the wife and I decided that we wanted some tasty Mexican food. To their credit, their food dishes are usually quite good. In fact, I don't believe we've ever had a bad dish in all the times we've visited Acitron. To be honest, the food (particularly their delicious Adobada) is the sole reason we've bothered to return.\\n\\nThat aside... and with the exception of an older, male waiter (who is both attentive and courteous), the service here is consistently mediocre (both at the bar and seated within the restaurant). On our last trip the waitress brought out our food and then disappeared for the entirety of our meal (note, the restaurant was half-full during this time). We attempted to flag her down to get refills for our cocktails but were unsuccessful. Both our margarita and water glasses sat empty for the duration of the meal. Unacceptable. At one point, we could see patrons at a nearby table pointing toward us and telling the waitress that we were trying to get her attention. Her response? She walked straight into the kitchen and did not bother to return until she came to ask if we wanted dessert or the check.\\n\\nSadly, this was the first time in my dining experience that negligent service drove me not only to greatly reduce a server's tip, but to leave a detailed note explaining why I had done so. From what I can see, the lack of quality Mexican options in Arlington is causing Acitron to get a bit lazy with respect to their treatment of patrons. As much as it saddens us, we're on the hunt for a new Mexican haunt with equally tasty food and much better than mediocre service."},{"name":"Chow n' Joy","address":"626C Somerville Ave, Ste C","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"Very good \\"American\\" Chinese food.

The decor and ambiance - gorgeous, but that's where it stops. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I visited Escobar on a Thursday night. We saw on their Instagram page that they had a happy hour that we decided to partake in for a little date night out. First, when we walk in, there are waitresses sitting and on their phones. This wouldn't have bothered me if we were at least acknowledged as customers. Didn't happen. There  was no one at the host stand to greet us so we assumed we find our own seats in which we did. Our waitress approaches us and was nice but the service lacked, ALOT. \\n\\nWe ordered food and during our wait we asked about the happy hour. She informed us that the happy hour ended. Hm, okay? It was 7pm. Checked their Instagram. Low and behold, another post encouraging patrons to come on in for happy hour was made just a few moments before.. False advertisement but whatever, we took her word for it. Still ordered the hookah and drinks for regular price. Drinks were not strong. Hookah was okay. Food took 45 mins to come out, lukewarm. Our waitress then comes back to tell us that they can honor the happy hour hookah but not the drinks.... Ohhhhhkayyyyyy?? Made no sense, but sure. At this point, we were over it and just wanted our check so we could mosey on down to Blu Cantina. They add gratuity by the way, which is probably why the waitresses don't care about providing great service. \\n\\nAs we're getting ready to head out, the owner, Snoop, walks by our table (and the three other tables nearby) without a single welcoming word.

Yes way too much cheese for one meal. I will have to say though, we were a bit disappointed with the Gorgonzola cheese as it was a little too bland on both the brat and tots. Seemed to be too little cheese on the tots also but I'm guessing that's portion control to keep the costs down. But it's a grey area, we'd rather pay a bit more for better coverage, especially if we're splurging for cheese smothered tots which we usually don't do.\\n\\nThey stress quite a bit about locally sourced meats which is great to see. I'm a little concerned with her pricing, I think they are actually too low. The bottle of cider was $2.50 each I think - heck raise that to $3.00. The brat was $8.00 by itself.

After several restaurants on our 'must try' list would not let us reserve a table before 10pm Saturday night for our special dinner, we turned to Scoutmob to see what was nearby. We had a bit of a time crunch as we had plans to head to the movies later that night. We wanted to try a different cuisine so Cuban was a good choice. We forgot to read the rest of the descriptor on the review to realize that this place was actually inside a larger hotel so took us about 10 minutes to figure out where it was hidden. It is located in the Midtown hotel just off Peachtree Road so its not something that will jump for you attention, you kinda have to search it out. They have reasonably priced parking at the deck. We went in for dinner about 8pm. Hilton, the manager I believe, was very friendly and nice and seated us right away. The place wasnt bursting at the seams but there were a few tables occupied. They let us know right away they did not have a liquor license and could not serve alcohol but we could bring our own. Reason states was change in management. This place will soon become a Hyatt! We chose to stay in and just have their virgin mojitos, which were delicious no doubt! We headed straight for entrees - I tried the lollipop baby lamb and my husband tried the arrozz con pollo. It took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive. Our waiter was nice, explaining how things worked and keeping us posted on when our food would arrive. I must say the entrees were surprisingly good. We had not heard any of our friends visit this place before. We did not read any reviews of it before heading over. We pretty much went there with no clue of what to expect. So it was truly such a treat to the palette to taste such vivid flavors. The arroz con pollo was well-cooked and fragrant, they threw in some olives there to give it a little tanginess. We ordered a side of yucca chips friend and boy was that amazing too! The lamb came with some mashed potatoes and a tomato garnish, theyw ere cooked to their succulent best and were cleaned off the plate in no time at all! We skipped the appetizer so we would do desserts - we ordered the creme brulee and the bread pudding. They were both simply fabulous. These are two of the densest, richest, moist desserts I have ever eaten. Goes to show they didnt try to dilute any ingredients with substitutes of any sort. We loved everything we ordered and were served. We actually forgot to present our Scoutmob deal to the waiter before he got our bill but he was nice enough to head back and change things around for us, even though the place had just then gotten busy for dinner. The manager was nice enough to stop by and check on us and how the food was. Since it was our anniversary dinner, he also took some pictures for us around the place! Very friendly and amicable and approachable with a big smile, Hilton is a great first impression. The decor inside wasnt anything ultra modern or over the top.

We had 6 adults and multiple kids (under 3).........yes, you guessed it, they charged us 18% gratuity. I guess my kids (even though they ate FREE and hardly ate anything really, were counted as part of the PARTY)?\\n\\n2) the older lady waitress (who seemed super busy with many other things to do), was nice, but not overly nice (as the many young staff they have there).  Things were going along pretty well, until the end, when i wanted to get my son some more ribs (I had the family style -ALL YOU CAN EAT - $19.99 plate).  My son (and other kids were outside witih grandparents walking around whilie i was on my third (small) plate of meat refills, so I was just about finished when I asked for a REFILL of Ribs ...and was quickly CUT OFF by the old lady waitress telling me....\\n\\n\\"you cant keep filling up on meat and then take it all home with you !!!! \\" \\n\\nI tried to correct her and explain it was for son (who she said I initially could just SHARE my food with him, since he was under 3), BUT decided to just grab one \\"to go\\" container and just leave.  I could tell it was no use for me to try to explain it to her and just leave.  We typically leave 20-22%, but when i saw the bill and it ALREADY had a 18% gratuity on the bill ?   are you KIDDING !    so, all she got a 18% tip (INCLUDED in our bill).  when your bill is well OVER $100 dollars, every % counts !\\n\\n3) the \\"all you can eat\\" option is good if you are super hungry, but they only give you a SMALL plate to \\"refill\\" each time.  Their sausage and brisket is pretty good, but GOOD SERVICE is also very important to me.  I have been in food service for nearly 15  years (high school, college and graduate school) and realize the value of a good server / waiter.\\n\\n4) My extended family wasnt impressed with any of the food though, just the \\"ambience\\", which reminded them of the \\"old west\\" ...since it was so rustic.  they ate the meat, but left the sides.  they also thought the WHITE BREAD was really good...so they loaded up on that !  I dont think they will want to go back, the next time they come visit. They didnt mention it at all over the course of their visit, so I guess they didnt like that much ?   \\n\\n5) I do happen to cuss a bit and i DID get a few angry stares from passing waiters as I was eating (which i thought was odd, until I mentioned it to my wife and she said that each time I swore, they were staring at me)......which was refreshing !  I didnt know that all the staff were that upstanding and moral !  wow !\\n\\n\\nI guess to be fair...the young ladies that did help me when we first got there and when we left were extremely nice and friendly AND their bathrooms were very clean (my kids kept having to GO potty) !\\n\\nAND it was nice to see the police there (county) keeping tabs on people (that is pretty standard to see them every time i have gone there).  \\n\\nI SHOULD HOPE THAT THE SALT LICK FEED THE POLICE FREE FOOD.

The waitstaff and chef took very good care of us.  There was no \\"special\\" menu.  We were just told that they could and would make anything we wanted, vegan.  Usually when a restaurant tells us this we receive food that is less than wonderful.  Not so at the Lime Leaf!  The appetizers were terrific.  The main courses were truly inspired.  We loved the Tamarind Tofu!  Wow!  And we also enjoyed the Basil Udon and the Veg Tofu Fried rice.  We asked that the chef make it without the egg and met zero resistance.  And the desserts were scrumptious!  It is so difficult to find a good vegan dessert,and the Lime Leaf had three from which to choose.

I live in the building above the restaurant so I constantly get whiffs of fried calamari as I am come home from work. However, I really do love this place. There is something about its approach to tapas that is so flawless that makes it stand above the other two notable Spanish tapas restaurants in the city. This last time I went here this week was truly remarkable. \\n\\nFirst, a note on the place itself. The restaurant itself is divided between a noisier bar area, and more intimate table setting. There is also a large outdoor patio that they keep heated during colder months, making it usable year round. I have eaten in all sections of the restaurant and they make this place truly fitting for a variety of purposes. NOTE: If you are with a large group, definitely sit by the outdoor fireplace, it makes for a really great evening. \\n\\nI always go for a glass of tempranillo. Usually, they have a few different kinds in their glass selection, all with different notes and identities. Although the restaurant employs its own professional sommelier, the wait staff I have interacted with all could claim the title in their own right. Simply tell the wait what kinds of wine you like, and maybe some of the dishes you think you are ordering for pairing purposes, and I doubt you will be disappointed. Someone else I was dining with ordered a a whisky-based cocktail However, hence the name of the restaurant, I always stick with wine. \\n\\nSome of the dishes I have ordered in the past that are especially good are the chorizo and figs, the pulpo (octopus), and the scallops. All of these are amazing and I definitely recommend them. However, since one of the people we were dining with was kosher (no pork or seafood), we decided to try different items. \\n\\nCheese: Just do it. They are just plain magnificent. We tried the mahon, the manchego, and the san simon. All three have different profiles: the san simon is a smoked cheese, the mahon is a little lighter, and the manchego a more mild version of its cousin, parmesan. All were magnificent and paired well with the fruit spread. \\n\\nWe also tried:\\n\\nPotato tortilla - a wonderful layering of potato and light cheese that is not overwhelming Caponata - both wonderfully spicy but not overpowering to the fresh taste of vegetables\\nCalamari - which is fried but not greasy and simply delicious\\nHangar steak - Beautifully cooked medium rare with a light, lemony sauce drizzled over the top. This dish is simply good because they cook the meat perfect, add a small touch, and do nothing else. \\n\\nFinally, we had the vegetable paella. These shared dishes take 45 minutes to come out, which you waiter tells you at the beginning of the meal. Trust me, it is well worth the wait. The dish comes in a large skillet with a bed of flavorful rice, with veggies and a garlic aioli. One you let the rice get a little crispy, and mix around all the wonderful pieces, this dish will blow your mind. This was my first time trying the large shared items, as I usually stuck to tapas. I will definitely be coming back to try these again. \\n\\nThis restaurant is a true gem and wonderful for large groups or an intimate date. I truly hopes it keeps up the phenomenal success it has enjoyed."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Outstanding pastry/sandwich place for breakfast or lunch.\\nEvery food we've tried is top notch.

Everything has a slip to fill out, but sometimes you fill it out and sometimes the worker fills it out.  Instead of piling it on at the wok bar, you have to explain what you want and there's so many options I just skip it.  The hot bar, well, it's always sucked.  I can't think of a single time I've looked at it and wanted a single thing on there.  In any NSM store.  And why the hell are local grocery stores putting BARS in?\\n\\nThe lady and I wandered in here when we had errands in the area.  The deli (or whatver you want to call it) is stretched out with what seems like a dozen station from espresso bar in the front to wok and ramen bar in the back.  It takes a lot of wandering around when there's nothing in particular you want.  I considered trying the ramen but there's a big ALL RAMEN BOWLS ARE SERVED WITH a bunch of stuff I didn't want and just didn't have the energy to mess with.

Why does it have to be freaking fancy?\\n\\nI went for the Reuben (it's a special!) at the sandwich counter, because the ones they stack up for the picking at Williams are pretty good.  It felt like a long time to get it, because there was only one hipster back there and there were a few sandwiches in front of me and frankly I was already irritated.  I forgot to order the sandwich unwrapped and by the time I'd confirmed that for some reason this store doesn't have bottles of pop and checked out the bread was soggy.  The first bite of the corned beef was tough and chewy and I just dropped the mess back into the wrapper and got my money back.  Complete disaster, which is what I'm starting to expect from these places.  It feels like they hired someone new to make decisions in this part of the store, and that person should be fired.\\n\\nFor the rest of the store, y'know, whatever.  It's a grocery store.  They've got hippy garbage, they've got national brands.  That's cool.  The employees are more friendly than efficient and the checkers are way too chatty.

I like Rudy's - a lot - but didn't feel like it was life changing. However, Salt Lick was life changing. \\n\\nI went twice, just to make sure. I went on a Sunday, had the beef ribs and some habanero chicken, with brisket and the other necessities. It was, simply, amazing. I've never eaten a beef rib quite like it. Huge, charred, and falling off the bone. Soaked in flavor. It was incredible.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was great, the big meat cooking contraption right near the entrance. The service was fast and very friendly. And the food came out quick and surprisingly hot and fresh. \\n\\nThe second time, got the nice plate of BBQ and Chicken with two types of sauce. It didn't let me down. My wife ate it with me and was blown away at the thickness of the brisket cut. Brisket isn't a high quality cut of meat, and normally thin. But here, the BBQ is so good that the cut is thick, juicy and incredible. \\n\\nI'm sorry, but Rudy's tastes like fast food BBQ after Salt Lick. \\n\\nI found nothing that compared. Eat here.

I would say this one amps up the southern foods a little more than Betty's, but other than that there isn't to much different about them. But Surly Girl still provides great food and a fun atmosphere, full of posters and unique decor.

I made reservation ahead of time as indicated on the description on the groupon. Two days before my reservation, I had to make a change to my reservation date. I called and they were very nice and professional to me when it came to changing my reservation.\\nOn the day of my reservation, I arrived and we were greeted by a very nice hostess. She led us to the back of the restaurant since the front is a bar setting. Along the way, on the right hand side were the sushi chiefs. After we were seated, the hostess told me that our waitress will be with us shorter. It took about 2-4 mins for our waitress to appear, which I didn't think it took too long for us to wait for her. The waitress asked what we would like to drink and we just ordered water. After the water came out we took a few more minutes to review what we would like to order. When we were being seated the hostess had already gave us the menu and the specials. We were given two slips to fill out what sushi we are going to order. After putting in our order my bf and I chatted a little bit and watched tv. There were three flat screen tvs hung on the wall. You will never be bored while waiting for your sushi to come out. \\nAfter probably about 5-10 mins the first plate came out. We ordered 6 rolls and 3 pieces of Maguro (Sashimi). The six rolls of sushis consist of Unagi Avocado Maki, Spicy Salmon Maki, Rainbow Maki, Owl Maki, Scorpion Maki, and Volcano Maki. They were are delicious. However, the Unagi and Spicy Salmon tasted like any regular sushi you can order at any other sushi restaurant. Overall, the sushi were very delicious, it look very presentable and it didn't consist of too little or too much rice.\\nOverall, my experience with Owl Station was positive. However, I wouldn't go here without a Groupon because their sushi can be a little bit on the pricey side since I can order the same kinds of sushi at a cheaper price and it is closer to where I live. \\nAside from the sushi, they have $1 oysters on Sundays, which is a deal. But I haven't tried it yet, so I cannot judge whether the oysters are fresh or not.\\nEven though, I might not go back to Owl, I do recommend it to others who wants to try some decent sushi that is close to the Boston area. I probably will come back if I can get another Groupon Deal. :)"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"The best barbeque imaginable....smokey, tender brisket, slathered in a perfect sauce.

I dined here last weekend with 8 people, and we were seated in the bar side of the restaurant, next to the single seater mens/ladies toilets. It was 7:30 PM and the place was packed.  Not usually an issue, but for some reason Siro's closed off the other restrooms for a private event, so there were only 2 toilets total for the use of about 300 people. In a matter of minutes there was a line of people surrounding our table as they waited to use the bathroom. I felt like I was sitting in the bleachers at a Red Sox game, there were people practically sitting in our laps. We asked the slow waitress if we could move the table a little away from the bathrooms (there was plenty of room), she said no. So after a long wait for our entrees (two were forgetten, and then when one arrived it was wrong), we asked just to have the meal removed from the bill, it was no longer wanted. The manager offered free dessert, but we declined. Who wants dessert if you have not eaten a meal? So she offered to comp some of the drinks. Great! We got the bill, but no drinks were comped. When we found our waitress (another 10 minute wait), she said no the manager was not going to comp drinks. wtf? She said she would in front of 8 people! Finally after strong but polite words to our waitress, the owner came over and comped the drinks, but scolded us for \\"making the waitress cry\\". Are you kidding me?

I can personally recommend the Tom Yum, Tom Ka, Red Curry, and Phad Woon Sen here. If you are new to Thai food, would like to try it for it's robust flavors, but are scared or dislike the heat (pepper) levels in the dish, this is the place you need to start. After you do and go elsewhere, you will be back.\\n\\nAnother plus is for many years, I ranked them highest among my favorite restaurants for service. Their wait staff was incredible, both in being pleasant and being attentive to needs such as food wait and drink refills. I will say over the last year I have been disappointed a few times as some of the wait staff seems to work less and have been replaced by a few that are inexperienced at best, entirely distracted at worst.\\n\\nThe only true negatives that bother me involve the soups. For a long time, the serving bowls were I would say a medium in size, holding a reasonable portion. They recently (read-the last 6 months or so) changed bowls to some artsy twisted square, which seems to hold almost half of the previous it replaced, as well is prone to dumping soup as it flails around easily. The second issue is the Tom Ka, one of the primary reasons I fell in love with this place. Easily the best Tom Ka I've ever had, no one touches it. Unfortunately it's so perfected even they have troubles keeping he standard. About 1 of every 3 times I order this now, it tastes like they got the recipe wrong or a new chef was put on. If you order this as much as I do, you will find out what I mean sooner or later. DO NOT let this hinder you from ordering it though, this soup must be tried. IMO, you will either hate it, or it will rank among your top 5 soups of all time (caveat-assuming that it's the 2 out of 3 recipe ;) ).\\n\\nFor those with delicate digestive systems, that can't handle coconut, or any spice, or worried about excessive flavors that thai is known for, I highly suggest you try the chicken Phad Woon Sen."},{"name":"Pure Taqueria","address":"300 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Our waitress was very nice.

It was labeled Caribbean, but the bartender said it was more Pacific Rim with Asian influences.

Not Earth moving by any means, but not bad either.  The lobster and brie empanadas were drowning in sauce, and there was only a hint of lobster flavoring.  The texture of the filling tasted more like black beans rather than lobster.  I'm biased on the pot stickers being an immigrant from a country that specializes in pot stickers.  I didn't like them at all, but my dining companion thought they were pretty good for what it was worth.  The biggest disappointment to me was that the pear in the goat cheese medallion was drowned so heavily in sauce that I couldn't tell what the fruit actually was.  The fruit was also pretty much raw.  I couldn't finish that either.   Lastly, the banana pecan spring roll was also meh.  I loved the idea, but the execution left something to be desired.  The banana inside was either overly ripe or overly cooked as it was pretty mushy in texture.  The shell of the spring roll was pretty rock hard as well.  \\n\\nThe food there teetered from poorly executed to alright.  The food is around two stars.

(It is really hard to eat at most vegetarian restaurants when you are gluten-free, unless you want a boring rice bowl. It is not a problem here.)\\n\\nLet's start with the food.  Don't think of this as a rice/noodle bowl place full of fake meats.  It is real food that feels like it should have tasted this way all along.\\n\\nThe Gobi Manchurian (Cauliflower tossed with Indian seasonings, breaded with chickpea flour, fried, and finished with sweet and spicy tomato sauce and fresh cilantro) is a MUST starter.  It was delicious, flavorful and quite filling.  It had a little spice, but not so much that my friends who like bland food would be upset.  \\n\\nThe problem is that there are other appetizers that I want to try!  Eggplant Caponata with Sundried Pesto Crostini, Beet-Potato Latkes, Portabella Saut√©, and more.  Each one sounds delicious.\\n\\nToday, I had the dinner special.  It was a root vegetable stew.  There was so much stew that I had to take home the rest.  It was flavorful with each vegetable being distinct (an accomplishment in a stew) and NOT mushy. Fortunately, it was a special because I want to try the Rustic Paella, Shepherd's Pie, and Moussaka Pizza.\\n\\nNow, a shout out to our server, Evelina.  She welcomed us to the restaurant.  She eagerly described what was popular and, by asking a couple of questions, recommended our choices.  We would not have had the Gobi Manchurian, if it was not for her.  Her service was attentive.  My cup of jasmine tea was constantly refilled, without my asking.  Water glasses were never more than half-empty.  She was friendly and courteous.  \\n\\nBe prepared to have that warm feeling in your tummy as you leave.  You will feel full and not stuffed (unless you want to).  You will feel like you had comfort food, even though you had never had the food before.

On a different occasion with just two, we were lucky enough to only wait about 20-30 minutes.  This location is a hole in the wall.  They take no reservations, and you're forced to wait outside until they can accommodate to your party size.  \\n\\nYes, the waitresses have a bit of pizzazz and attitude, though that's what adds flare to the atmosphere.

Tons of clams and mussels, enough shrimp so everyone in our party got at least one, and one giant lobster sat ontop like it was king.  Warning: ask for extra napkins because cracking the lobster can be quite messy.  Delicious.

Service was okay....it's loud in this restaurant so having the specials yelled to you is kind of a strange start., but no biggie.  We all ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees right from the get go cuz we were HUNGRY!  \\n\\nCalamari came out, it honestly tasted like nothing.  Literally.  Even the batter had no flavor.  There was this sauce that came with the bread and I just dunked it in that so I wasn't just eating flavorless fried circles.  I kind of found it odd that we had to ask for olive oil for our bread.

But again, no biggie, it was brought quickly when we asked for it.\\n\\nFood came....and....meh....I could have made better at home.  I ordered the Rigatoni with sausage.  The sausage oddly enough, really didn't have any flavor either.  I'm used to an adequate amount of fennel in Italian sausage and this seemed to have none.  Sauce was okay, just basic.  I was starving so I ate it all but it truly wasn't any better than Barilla.\\n\\nEveryone else seemed to like their food just fine, nothing to rave about, nothing memorable.\\n\\nUnfortunately the most memorable part of the evening was when the waitress literally flipped out over us splitting the bill.  She brought the bill, we passed the bill around the table tallying up our different totals as some people were drinking alcohol and others were not.  We wrote the different amounts down, etc handed it back.  A few minutes later she came back and said we were short by three dollars.  No biggie, someone handed her a $5 bill and she returned to finish running our cards.\\n\\nI get a text message from my bank every time I charge something.  Suddenly my cell phone starts blowing up and it's showing me that she's charged me three times...twice for the amount I wrote and once for an amount no where close to what I wrote down.

After putting miss thing her in place reminding her that I had come to her nicely without attitude and I expected the same in return, to stop swearing at me or we could call the manager over and have a three way discussion, and that THERE WAS NO MATH TO FIGURE OUT!  We wrote the amounts she was to run.\\n\\nShe responded by saying this is ridiculous, on a busy Friday night you expect me to do this?\\n\\nAgain, what?!?!?! *insert are you kidding me look*  I advised her that restaurants the world over have been running separate credit cards for eons and no one has ever had issue with reading a last name, finding said card, and charging said card amount written next to name.  Some people were even couples so it wasn't even 7 different cards to run.\\n\\nNever in my life have I been spoken to like this....I'M IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY and I know that even when you're frustrated, you NEVER take it out on the customer.  She quickly apologized when she realized she was being an ass and said that math has never been her strong suit and she just got flustered.  I told her not to worry about it, went back to the table, and quickly got the hell out of there!\\n\\nAs of this morning the three charges are still showing on my credit card....so instead of a $50 dinner I'm charged for one just shy of $200.\\n\\nEven if the service had been amazing I still wouldn't go back as I wasn't that impressed with the food.

It's still not good, but it happens to be one of the few restaurants we can walk to from our new house, so we've given it a few tries.\\n\\nThe one strange standout in a good way? The spring rolls, which are pretty much always awful everywhere, are really good here. For spring rolls. I almost had the idea that they make them from scratch as opposed to defrosting them. They're fresh and gingery inside and served with a nice sauce. \\n\\nBesides that - we've had the Massaman curry, nothing to write home about. The curry itself was too thick, and had an odd flavor, and the vegetables were few in number and poorly cooked. The Green curry was a little better, but kind of more like white than green curry, with not enough herbs added to color it, and very heavy. The Drunken noodles are awful, basically it's like they are stir fryed in ketchup. Very strange. \\n\\nThe Buddha noodles, on the lunch menu called the Angel noodles  I think, are pretty good - we've ordered them twice - but has got to be the ugliest, least appealing dish I've ever seen. They put some steamed vegetables on the plate, then cover them up with a pile of clumpy rice noodles, then pour thick peanut sauce on top. What arrives in front of you looks like a pile of shit, to be honest. However, once you mix it all together it's spicy and and has a nice flavor. I really don't understand why they can't mix them up for you and present an appealing dish. It makes no sense. \\n\\nHad the Hot Basil also. Nothing great, but totally edible and satisfying. \\n\\nDo be warned - I've lived in Asia for some time and can deal with very spicy, and I order medium here.

Calamari is one of my favorite things and generally a go-to in an unfamiliar place to test out the menu. I've had calamari all over the country and theirs is hands-down one of the best versions I've ever had. Light crunchy breading, a flavorful and addictive sauce, plus chopped peppers, sesame seeds, and dashes of Sriracha on the place add even more flavor. Definitely a must-have. The apple and sausage ravioli is also fantastic (and as ravioli is not one of my favorite pastas, I am very difficult to please in this area!). The brown butter sauce adds sweetness to complement the savory sausage, and additional crisped sausage and sage on top add more flavor as well as a nice textural component. The portions for both these dishes are large enough to share (which is what my date and I typically end up doing!) \\n\\nThe weekly tapas offerings are also worth a try.

Really interesting menu and the sashimi as well as the crab flight were heavenlyyyyy.\\n\\nThe bad - overly dark room where you couldn't read the menu easily and therefore were forced to sit by people who were using their phones to light up their menus and hugely distracting to other diners.  AND the waitstaff seemed to have no problem with people taking FLASH photos of their food in a dimly lit restaurant. TACKY.  I don't care if your dish has an effing diamond in it, you don't take flash photos in a restaurant and as a restaurant, you tell your customers to not do it and have some basic respect for others.

That's really all I can think to say when I think of Bamboo Sushi. During my entire dining experience in Portland, I was most impressed by the food that Boyfriend and I ate here. Service was totally on point - kudos to Kaikani, he really made our experience fantastic!\\n\\nFor an appetizer, two drinks and two entr√©es, the tab still only came out to $56 before tip! For a sushi place, I was super impressed by this pricing (oh San Francisco, how you have broken me with your big city pricing). Boyfriend and I had ordered the okonomiyaki, a Lemon Tree and Maker's Cup cocktail, the Green Machine roll with albacore and the Sumo Burger.\\n\\nI was very much impressed with the Sumo Burger. You wouldn't think that a sushi place would have a rockin' burger, but Bamboo has one! The wagyu beef was delicious and cooked to perfection. The egg was amazing and the yolk ran all over the beef when you popped the egg (there's something about adding an egg to your burger that makes it infinitely better). The Green Machine roll was also very delicious. The sauce had a mild kick to it but wasn't anything overly spicy. Definitely glad we chose to add the albacore - otherwise, I think it might've been a little bland.\\n\\nI'll admit that the okonomiyaki was a little weird initially, mainly because it looked funny with all the little wavy bits on top of it. But it was very yummy! If you're not fond of the taste of fish though, you're going to hate this. But for me, this was perfection.\\n\\nEverything was so filling, Boyfriend and I ended up having to box up about 1/4 of the burger and 1/2 the okonomiyaki as well. After tip, the bill still only came to $70. While this was the most expensive meal Boyfriend and I shared in Portland, I think it was worth every penny. This will definitely become a regular stop when we come back for a return visit! :)"},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"After a rowdy evening of spreading Santa's cheer, I headed out in search of food. Yet Mexican wasn't what I wanted, and neither was Front Page. It had to be GOOD. Knowing this, the clear and obvious choice was The Porter.\\n\\nWalking in here decked out like a reindeer with my Santa, I thought we'd get a lot of stares (which we did). Yet the staff was mostly friendly to us, and some of the patrons even smiled. Our server seemed a little beat, but I've heard of the legendary crowds here so perhaps at 11pm she was feeling ready to head home and not serve a Santa or two. Hmm.\\n\\nThe food itself was very good! I loved the mason jars for standard drinks, and the meal itself was well put together. I had the cobb salad special and the rest of the crew had reubens and burgers. Nothing was left, so obviously this place gets it right! Every last french fry, piece of lettuce, scrap of bun - demolished. Yum. My only qualm with the food was the size of the lettuce pieces. While I appreciate the sheer volume of the salad for the price, I hate having to cut up my salad. It's not a steak, so having it be bite-sized would be nice. Also, if you say it has avocado, putting in two skinny slices doesn't cut it. Perhaps it was because it really was 11pm, but I can forgive them as it was a delicious meal.\\n\\nAs for seating, it was perfect for 6 people in the back. No one was squeezed in and everyone seemed content with their personal space bubble. I couldn't see anywhere for a larger group to go, but if you're 6 or less, you're fine. Don't worry about being sardines because, well, you won't be!\\n\\nOverall I'd come back and try it again, braving peak hours to see how the food matches up.

There will always be a line.  They don't accept cash.  The place is small and often jam-packed. They do serve wine, but don't serve dessert/coffee.  The specials are on a chalkboard.  Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get to the important stuff.  This place runs like a well-oiled machine.  Once you step out of line and walk to your table, your server has already set your table, poured your water, and put out menus and a basket of bread.  You will never ever be waiting on your server, as they try to keep things moving given the demand of the line versus the available tables.  The food is just exceptional.  It blows the twice as expensive restaurants on Hanover right out of the water. Whether it's appetizers or seafood or pasta, you will be blown away by the taste and the freshness.  Also, the prices for what you get in quantity/quality just can't be beat.  I once went here with a friend and shared an app, got a bottle of wine, and we each had an entr√©e (his had seafood) and we paid 40-something dollars.  By the way - I know what you're thinking, that must have been some crappy wine.  Nope!  Well priced but great quality and paired well with our food.  You probably won't want to dine here with a prospective client, small child or impatient family member - but you WILL want to dine here with everyone else you love and cherish.  My advice - opt for an early or late dinner to minimize your wait. If you're in line with someone, run to the atm across the street to kill some time and get some cash for when your bill arrives. Once you're done eating, instead of lingering to chat with your date in the small space of Giacomo's, walk a few paces to the several dessert places or bars to grab something sweet, a coffee, or an after dinner drink.  There are several options (Modern Pastry, Mike's, etc) and you can take your time.  Or there's a cigar bar nearby if that's more your speed.\\n\\nIf at times you just can't deal with Hanover Street (I get it!), try their location in the South End.  Not as robust of an old-school Italian menu at that location, but the food is also top notch, parking is a (tiny) bit easier, and I believe they accept credit cards.  But don't go there til you've gone to the original first :-)"},{"name":"Bangkok Thai Restaurant","address":"1492 Piedmont Ave NE, Ste A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went with some friends the other night.  From what I was told Bangkok Thai is the first Thai restaurant in Georgia and has been around since 1977.  WOW!

For the main course I had their Ruby Curry Chicken to which I added cabbage, broccoli and carrots, and it already came with other veggies.  The curry was so flavorful and light.  Some thai places the curry can be thick and fatty tasting....but the curry at Bangkok was light and tasty.  I didn't have enough heat to my curry because I was sharing the meal; however once I added the red chilli powder for that extra kick.....it was perfect.  The penang chicken was light and tasty as well.  \\n\\nCome to think of it......next time I think I will just ask them to put fresh jalapenos in with the curry for that extra kick and sweat!  \\n\\nService was good.....they were very attentive.

I was introduced by an Eastern European girl I had recently met, who promised me that Polish food was delicious...and unlike everything else shes told me, this was true....\\n\\nWhen you walk into Polonia, the atmosphere and the greeting you receive instantly give you a homey vibe - it's like you've gone to grandma's house for dinner, except grandma's charging you for the food.  The restaurant is family owned and operated, and that is obvious in the quality of the food and the service.\\n\\nThe menu is filled with standard Polish fare - I suspect that a lot of the people who have complaints about the food are unfamiliar with Eastern European cuisine.  To be honest, it isn't for everyone.  My favorites are the potato pancakes, borscht (a beet soup, served with sour cream), and the pierogi (boiled dumplings stuffed with cheese, potato, sourkrout, and other ingredients).  I'm a vegetarian, but I love that I can still eat here despite the huge selection of meat dishes on the menu.\\n\\nPolonia also has a great selection of Polish drinks.  There is a range of beer types for any beer drinker's palate - my favorites are Zywiec and Okocim (for porter lovers), and Warka (for those who don't go for dark brews).  There is also a selection of wines, including a delicious mead (honey wine, in case you didn't know.)\\n\\nFinally, there's the desert.  Even if you don't have room for desert, get some to go.

I placed a online order for quite a large party, as we were feeding our management staff dinner. Our first choice was a local Chinese 'mom and pop' restaurant, but they unfortunately, do not accept American Express. With limited options and time, we opted for the nearby Panda Express. While being a manager in customer service myself, I realize the large order in a short amount of time could potentially not be feasible, so I called before I paid for the order, two hours before the needed pick up time just to make sure they could accommodate our order request at the time I needed. I was assured it would be ready in that time. In fact, I called 3 times, once to make sure they took American Express, another time to make sure they could have it ready, and once more to add another entree. So far, smooth sailing. When I arrived at the time I needed, the poor girl at the counter, Suzan, indicated she didn't know who I spoke to but my order wasn't due to be done for another hour. I have 20 people waiting for dinner! Now, I'm frustrated. She apologized profusely offered my additional entrees for free and was able to get it done in about 30 min as she jumped into the fire and is finishing my order now. As I stand here writing this review, I look like a like a complete jerk because everyone in line is waiting to be helped by now, only one person instead of two, AND the answer to other patrons when there isn't anymore orange chicken is because \\"we have a large order, can you wait about 10 min?\\" I watched at least four people walk out.

The atmosphere can seem slightly eerie considering how dark and large the main dining area is, but it also feels more upscale and romantic. The prices are comparable to its competitors and the main reason why it's not as popular, in my opinion, is because it is located at the end of Moody Street. \\n\\nThe service was good and efficient. The Siam fried rice I got was a perfect portion. The shrimps were big, the chicken was tender, there was sufficient vegetables, and the sauce was flavorful. There was an option of adding $1 to have brown rice instead of white. I would definitely recommend trying it!

Unlike college we did not order from some local chain, we stepped up, WAY up to Antico Pizza.  It was my first time and it won't be my last.  \\n\\nThe sitting is communal, large wood tables that hold multiple parties at the same time.  It reminded me of a brunch place I used to drag myself to on Sunday morning's in San Francisco and I love the concept.  We were in a party of four and had no trouble grabbing a table in the front room.  Which turned out to be a blessing, since the entire restaurant had the thermometer set at Blast Furnace, but the front room occasionally got a little breeze from the front door, allowing you to breathe.  Seriously, they aren't losing any money on the A/C bill, but I digress.  They only have one bathroom for the entire place, so don't drink a lot of water before you go.  It is BYOB without a corkage fee though, so I consider that a more than equitable trade.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I shared two pizzas, the Fromaggio, which is four cheeses, garlic and basil.  Confession:  me and the girl have an unhealthy obsession with basil, so that disclosure aside, it was amazing.  Like a 4 year-old acting up in public, it had a charred bottom.  Not burnt, just right.  The basil was on top of the pizza, fresh and in large chunks, like taking a breath of fresh air on a mountain top.\\n\\nThe second pie we devoured was the San Gennaro, which is salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala, cipolline.  Now I am from the midwest, so I only recognized one of those items, but all together, it was a fine pie.\\n\\nAs a little added bonus, as we were leaving, they gave us a free pizza to go, the place was closing, they had an extra and we gladly accepted it.  We had it for lunch (ok, that is a lie, we had it for breakfast, sorry mom) the next day.  And it had some type of pepperoni maybe on it?  Whatever it was, it was the best of the three.  We are going back just to find out what it was and get it again, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.\\n\\nTo Recap:\\n\\nThe Good:  The pizza is the best in the city and I would know, I have eaten at all 476 places that serve it here.  The setup with the communal tables is fun and any staff that gives me a free pizza as I am walking out the door, is second on my favorite person list only to Santa Claus.\\n\\nThe Bad:  I am in my mid 30's and I felt like I was chaperoning a middle school dance.  Come on Gen X'ers, let's take this place back from those damn kids!  And let's get them to stay off my lawn while we are at it!  Also, one bathroom is tough, one waste backet with a monutain of used paper towels is tougher.

Again, dishes cleared, the server was unapologetic, nearly to the point of implying that we were lying about the other plates.  In the meantime, two of us were re-upping with different beers, having started with Spaten Oktoberfest.  We EACH received the wrong beer TWICE, to total four wrong beers that we sent back.  When I calmly tried to work the server through our requests, he literally rolled his eyes at me like a 12 year old, behaving as if the mistakes were clearly ours. \\n\\n The whole ordeal lasted literally 2.5 hours as we were ignored by our two different servers.  When we got our bills, the beers that we returned were listed for payment.  It's like eating at Just Brakes.  We're already there to spend a load of money.  We are fit, well-dressed, patient, kind, jovial, well-read, college-educated, middle-class people eating in a highly reviewed restaurant and spending over $50 per person.  We were treated like criminals at worst and inconveniences at best.  This restaurant has fantastic food.  The Chirizo & Figs, Crepes, Empanadas, Steak Dishes, Crispy Pork, Mushrooms w/ Goat Cheese, Patatas Bravas, all magnificent. \\n\\nIt's such a pity the service was so terrible.  I would actively dissuade my friends and family from eating here.  You know the pretentious restaurants that treat their patrons so badly in the movies?  This and Bluepointe in Buckhead are the only dining experiences I've had that actually rival that fiction.  We always tip generously.  The service was so bad that I tipped only 17%.  People make mistakes, I realize.  It was the attitude with which the problems were addressed that has permanently turned me from this place."},{"name":"Szechuan Kitchen","address":"15450 Boones Ferry Rd, Ste 5","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3","text":"I stopped in here for the first time for lunch today and ordered to go.

Austin apparently has a reputation for tacos and BBQ and Salt Lick is a testament to the fact that they don't play around when it comes to BBQ.\\n\\nWe were a group of 6 with about 4 plates of meat to share and let me tell you--the meats weren't stacked like bundles of cash--I scoffed at the single-digit pieces, underestimating the power of how much each piece can keep you full. We had beef brisket, pork & beef ribs, and sausage and they were all so delicious. Thick, tender, fatty, juicy--every word you can think of that makes you drool when you think of amazing BBQ. Normally, I'd shy far, far away from hot sauce because the slightest bit can set my tongue on fire but their hot sauce was seriously nothing and I ate lots and lots of it. \\n\\nThe complimentary sides (pickles, white bread, cole slaw, beans) were nothing to write home about but nice to have since some of the meats seemed to be sent straight to the grill without any marinating or seasoning. I wish we ordered more but I was satisfied and ready to go on our next food adventure. Supposedly, the lines to get in this place on any given weekend flies out the door, but we were lucky that there were plenty of tables--like, really, really lucky.

Blitz Ladd is a fairly typical sports bar: you have the TVs mounted on each wall (lots of Samsungs, which I like to see), an open atmosphere where a lot of people can cram into and some nice comfy couch areas where larger groups can sit together.\\n\\nI read a lot about the service being poor but it was fine for us. Our Zack Galifianakis look-a-like server (he was even wearing a headband which helped the look) was very friendly and was attentive when he needed to be. That all being said, it wasn't very packed when we went... so it could be a completely different story when the place has lots of people.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good. I had a turkey french dip sandwich, which was awesome because I've never seen a place have that on the menu and I always need to ask if it's doable. My wife had a sandwich that she thought was \\"totally unique\\" (trying to remember here... and I have a terrible memory and can't).\\n\\nI thought the fireplace that was in the middle of a seating area was a nice touch. Will need to take advantage at a later date.\\n\\nSo all in all, enjoyed Blitz Ladd and will come again. Good atmosphere, food and prices.

Thei classic italian hoagie hits the spot with different types of italian meats and cheeses, made to order on your choice of bread (and there are a lot of choices). \\n\\nThe only reason I can't give Reuben's a higher score is for their customer service. While the crazy environment of a NYC deli is great, there isn't a lot of order and its pretty overwhelming for customers. And, out of the multiple times that I have been there, 1/2 the time they don't make my sandwich right.

We asked for a booth (there are 4 or 5 booths there) and the hostess told us we couldn't have one unless we were a party of 4. Shortly after we were seated a party of 2 shows up and they get seated in a booth! I know this sounds like I have a grudge against this place now.

That said, I went to Red Lentil with a couple that is currently doing the Vegan thing, and I enjoyed the experience. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it certainly opened my eyes to Vegan alternatives and I definitely see myself returning some time in the future.\\n\\nRed Lentil is a small place and when we arrived it was a fairly busy Saturday lunch crowd. Seating is limited and in close proximity to the other diners, but not uncomfortable. Service was adequate, with no real marks in the negative (short of smoothies that arrived a bit late), but none greatly positive either. The food, however, ranged from real good to simply okay.\\n\\nAppetizer:\\n\\nGobi Manchurian ($7.00) - The Gobi Manchurian was far and away the winner of the entire luncheon. The spices were well balanced and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The Cauliflower wasn't tough at all, and the supplemental vegetables were freshly cooked and still had enough crispiness to offer a satisfying texture. When I return to Red Lentil, this is definitely a dish deserving of a sequel.\\n\\nMeal:\\n\\nZen Veggie Burger ($7.00) - I got a Veggie burger with a side of sweet potato fries for the main course. The Veggie burger was tasty, the patty itself was quite well flavored, but it was a bit softer than I had anticipated. The softness was actually a little too much - if the patty had been a little more solid I feel it would've worked better. It was still considerably more enjoyable than a patty made out of bird seed, a quality I'd say has been shared by veggie burgers I've had in the past.\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries were thick cut, and a nice middle ground between crispy and soft. They were served with a tangy barbecue sauce for dipping. I especially liked the fact that you had just enough fries to provide a side, but they were limited enough to be enjoyed without gorging on them.\\n\\nBeverage:\\n\\nMustang Smoothie ($5.00) - Fresh made and almost overwhelmingly tart. The smoothie was good, but I feel that the heavy tartness was due to the strawberries being under-ripe. Regardless, as fruit smoothies go, Red Lentil makes a fresh one.\\n\\nOverall, my feelings on Red Lentil should be taken as a pretty heavy positive, even if the review seems lukewarm. If certain negatives could be improved, I would find myself eating here more often. I will return, however - so expect a review update sometime in the near future."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"We originally planned to eat at Raglan with a reservation the 1st night we were in town but ended up going on Christmas Day because Magic Kingdom was at capacity.\\n\\nI had the burger along with an appetizer of the onion rings and fries with truffle oil.

It was a bit of a shock because it was a purplish crust. No marinara which I had asked for but was told I misunderstood what I asked for and they brought on the side. The pizza was charred to a crisp. Like charcoal. My son didn't like it because of this  when we pointed it out to the server we got another argument. We were told this is how it always is and they sell hundreds of them. We assured her that it was not anything but burnt and she argued with us. She did leave our table after leaving us pretty upset and got it taken from the bill but honestly by that time it was too late. When she told us they took it off she still argued with us about the quality of the food and kept with her story that this is how the hundreds they have sold previously were served.

If it was just based upon the food, I would say 3 or 4. The food overall was good for a lunch buffet. Nice selection and overall, everything was seasoned well and yummy. However, I will admittedly say I've never tried Persian before. And $10 for a lunch buffet, while not wonderful, was alright. I also appreciated that everything was labeled pretty clearly, as another reviewer noted.\\n\\nHowever, I want to give the restaurant a 1 star based off the bad service. I entered and told them immediately that I had a Groupon as the two signs at the entrance inform you to do. The hostess said it was fine for me to use it for the lunch buffet but I would be charged dinner buffet prices. Alright, that's fine, because I just want to use it and I'm rarely in the area. They seated me promptly (it was empty at the time we went, so, that's to be expected), and they brought waters, but that was it. After that point, the waitstaff never checked back on us, to refill our waters, see if we wanted anything else, or even to provide the check. I had to get up to go get the check. And when I went to go redeem my Groupon, what I can only assume to be the owner, rudely told me I was unable to use it on the lunch buffet. I kindly stated that the waiter that seated me said it was fine to use it at lunch, although I would be charged dinner buffet prices. The owner then proceeded to fight with me over what their employee had told me and said I couldn't use it. When I tried to discuss how I thought that was irrational, he simply walked away in the middle of me speaking and left the waiter to ring me up (with the bill I had to go retrieve myself mind you). \\n\\nHere's the long story short: I recognize the promotional stipulations of deals like Groupon and respect them. But if your staff tells me I can use it, when I asked them from the beginning, then it's useful to honor that in the spirit of customer service. It's also usually better to try and work with the customer, than just yell and them and then leave. I ended up not using the groupon, instead just paying the full price for lunch buffet. My companion and I left the restaurant with such a bad taste in our mouths from the service that I found it highly unlikely I'd ever return, even if the food was decently good. I immediately called Groupon's customer service, they profusely apologized and told me that's never the experience they want customer's to have the businesses they work with, and gave me a full credit for the amount I paid. THAT is good customer service.\\n\\nIf you go to Alborz for the food, that's fine. But don't expect a pleasant dining experience."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Row 34 was a disappointing experience. First of all, it's very difficult to get a seat here, which just raises the stakes for how good we expect the food and service to be. They don't take reservations between 630-830 aka when everyone eats dinner. Every time we've attempted to go it has been at least an hour wait for both the dining room and the bar.\\n\\nThe food was hit or miss:\\n- We ordered oysters which were fresh and well shucked and the sauces provided were decent. No surprise here as it is an oyster bar and most places can handle doing oysters properly.\\n- We then ordered 2 Crudo's, 2 Ceviches and a Tartare. The Sea Bass ceviche was excellent; the scallop ceviche was just ok. The tartare was tuna tartare was decent, nothing special. Both of the crudos were not very good at all. Really disappointed in the quality.\\n- We then were upsold on a charcuterie-type board when we really just wanted the uni toast. We were told that the uni toast would be on the board and we'd get 4 things for only $11 more than the toast itself. Seemed like a good deal until the uni toast was NOT a part of the board. The board had 2 pates on it which were barely edible, again extremely disappointed in quality here. The uni toast when it did come was really good and I would highly recommend it.\\n- We then ordered 2 lobster rolls which were pricey but among the best we'd ever eaten. They were absolutely delicious, especially in the context of everything we'd had before them.\\n- Finally we got the Jonah Crab Cake, which was listed as an entree but was normal appetizer size. It was not good at all which is awful because it's not hard to make crab cake delicious, it is inherently good. The black beans and the crab cake did not taste good together.\\n\\nAnd the final part of the experience was the service. For a restaurant of this popularity and price point we expect at least decent service. In reality our waitress was trained at a TGI Friday level of service which was infuriating. Plates were never cleared and just kept pilling up on the table, water was never refilled, drinks sat empty for long periods of time. It was really bad.\\n\\nThe only reason it's a 3 star and not worse is because some of the food was absolutely delicious. Lobster roll was a star, sea bass ceviche was very good and so was the uni toast.

Lady- how about a quick \\"ok just so you know your duck bao and your seafood bao doesn't apply to the $9 combo?\\" (There are fine prints on the wall menu but I don't think anyone in their right minds is gonna stand there and read the entire wall prior to ordering when they're HUNGRY!) \\nSeafood baos is an $0.75 charge to a combo\\nDuck bao isn't even part of the combo so that is $4.50 on its own. I mean not going to break the bank but definitely would like some kind of courtesy check prior to charging someone's card if the entire order isn't part of the \\"$9 combo\\". \\n\\nAnyway- we tried all of the baos and they were all good except for the tofu one (bland), Katsu could use more curry sauce, croquette shell is hard- weird and the fried chicken is dry.

Lola informed us (sadly) that she was out of catfish, so my wife and I selected crawfish etoufee; we both had beans and rice as one side, but I picked collard greens for my second and she had fries. The etoufee was very good, quite authentic. Flavorful but not loaded with heat, with plenty of mudbug tails. The beans were dark red kidney beans in a simple yet tasty sauce. Collard greens were seasoned well and not overcooked, and the french fries had been whole potatoes recently. In this location. \\n\\nOur third diner got the chicken dinner and was very impressed. Crispy exterior and moist interior. He also selected the \\"special\\" tea, which was sweet and tasted strongly of peaches (in a good way). \\n\\nIf there was a complaint at all about the food: It was heavy on the salt.

I had been hearing about how wonderful and amazing this \\"Antico\\" was for over a year.  All the rave reviews had lead to to question, what about this Antico does everyone love, is Antico really as stupendous as everyone says, and if everyone loves Antico so much, how will I ever get the opportunity to meet this pizza pie face to face? \\n\\nThe next big moment in any epic tale of love is the unexpected meeting. One surprising Wednesday night, I had to run to an event right after work that ended around 7:30.  A friend working in a near by building was getting off around the same time and we decided we needed to treat ourselves to an impromptu mid week pick me up.  Antico got tossed out as an option and from there my friends, fate took hold of the situation. Suddenly there was no traffic in Atlanta and we easily got a parking spot in the lot behind the restaurant.  Then, after hearing for ages that the line outside Antico would be insane there was NO line.  Wednesday night at 8 o'clock people- its when the magic happens. THEN, we got a seat at one of the long tables by the kitchen. \\n\\nSo that's where the relationship started moving really quickly. I felt so at home with Antico, like I had known it forever. All the people around me were either devouring their pizza or, like me, salivating over the smell of pizza cooking only feet from our seats. Being that the restaurant is BYOB, you can be who you are and Antico is so fine with anything from PBR to Moet and everything in between. Finally, there's that moment when you just know.  After waiting about 5 minutes, our pizza arrived on the large silver platter.  I bit in and there was no going back.  This is a forever relationship. Antico's atmosphere is authentic, charming, and welcoming and the food....Man O Man. The pizza lives up to the hype. Try it.

An old building houses the entire market.  I visited on a Saturday afternoon and there were only four businesses, that I could tell, in operation that day.  They were:\\n\\n- Bell Street Burritos\\n- JDR Delishery\\n- Jake's Ice Cream\\n- Hilda's\\n\\nThese are all local businesses.\\n\\nBell Street Burritos moved here after being forced off its former Westside space on Howell Mill to make way for an Advance Auto Parts.  I quickly grew fond of Bell Street Burritos when it was in my neighborhood, so O4W should feel lucky to have it.  You can read my review of Bell Street here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bell-street-burritos-atlanta-2.\\n\\nJDR Delishery is a relatively new bakery/coffee shop from Jake Rothschild of Jake's Ice Cream.  I can't comment on this bakery since I didn't try anything from it except for a bite of one of their coconut treats.  It was tasty.  I believe Hilda's restaurant gets its bagels from JDR because I saw Hilda's staff walking back and forth between Hilda's and JDR with bagels.\\n\\nJake's Ice Cream is a local, artisan, \\"gourmet\\" ice cream brand.  It reminds me of High Road Craft Ice Cream, but not nearly as sophisticated or refined.  Jake's Ice Cream stand is located directly across from the Delishery.  You can get a cup/cone of ice cream (two scoops) for $3+ or in a waffle cone for $4+.  For more info on Jake's, check out my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/jakes-ice-creams-and-sorbets-atlanta#hrid:2I-bWnbIow7q0nlWUYP42Q.\\n\\nHilda's is a breakfast and brunch restaurant with sit-down service.  I think the restaurant formerly known as Picnic has merged with Hilda's.  The reason being, when we were seated at Hilda's, we were handed two menus: one for Hilda's and one for Picnic.  Picnic is described on the menu as \\"comfort food, Southern style.\\"  For my thoughts on Hilda's, see my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hildas-atlanta#hrid:OMpMuxzprc2wVrU5l6H3sg.\\n\\nAltogether, Irwin Street Market kind of looks like a dump.  I'm tempted to compare it to a junkyard, but it's not that bad.  Maybe flea market is a better comparison, but still, it's not that bad either.  Hopefully, you get the idea.  The space is filled with old furniture and decor that is being re-used and re-purposed.\\n\\nThe common area, where JDR and Jake's is located, is akin to a living room.  People hang out on the couches, read books, work on their laptops, etc.  I didn't confirm if there's free Wi-Fi, but I'd venture to guess there is.  There's a covered patio out back.  Bell Street and Hilda's have their own separate spaces, but you can sit and eat in the common area if you'd like.\\n\\nThe folks who work here are nice, so that's a plus.\\n\\nParking is free.  There's a small paved parking lot in front and a small gravel lot in the back.  Street parking is also available.

We were lucky there was a snow storm, so we got a reservation last minute--otherwise you might want to plan ahead.\\n\\nAmbiance: Although they market this as a \\"workingman's\\" joint, it's a bit more fancy than that (although I was in jeans and bean boots and felt totally fine, but it's certainly not a dive bar or after work joint). There are impossibly high ceilings, an open kitchen--I loved hearing the staff clap when the Boston Globe review was published!--it feels like a modern take on old school industrial. Loved it. Upon arriving, the coat check person grabbed our jackets, was super friendly, and we sat immediately even thought the third member of our party wasn't quite there yet. The menus were beautifully designed and easy to read and understand.\\n\\nDrinks: I had heard the beer selection was great and wanted to try that list. There's a giant draft menu with all sorts of great selections from local breweries and other microbreweries. The beers were on the expensive side at $10ish dollars, but they were really good and different, so in my opinion, worth it. The waiter knew his stuff and really steered us in the right direction.\\n\\nApps: Obviously, we got the Oysters. As an oyster novice, we asked our waiter to guide us (more to come on him later) and he was awesome, pointing out his favorites and helping us select. We tried the Row 34 (our favorite), the Rocky Nook (a little trouty, interesting, but I wouldn't get it again), and the Southern Cross (close second). The waiter described each, and they were true to description. The three sauces (mignonette, cocktail sauce with horseradish, and an Asian sauce) were great. the Row 34 oysters are the same as Island Creek, but they live at the top of the ocean instead of the bottom, so have a different shape and flavor. I guess they were in the 34th row of what the Island Creek Oyster farmers tested, hence the name (cool!).\\n\\nSides: The roasted carrots with herb yogurt--they were delish. Orange and purple whole carrots roasted with cumin, on a bed of herb yogurt and topped with an herb dressing. Soft and really tasty. Old Bay Onion Rings--my favorite of the sides. We ordered them with the black pepper sauce and that had a wonderful kick. They were thin, crunchy, and not too old-bay ish. The only fail here was the broccoli in IPA and cheddar sauce. It was a little mushy and just not what I expected.\\n\\nMains: I had the delicious mustard hake. It's a traditional white fish and was a pretty big portion (didn't finish it). The mustard cleared out my sinuses when I got a big bite of it--which was awesome since it's winter in Boston and that needs to happen! It was moist, but the crumbs were crunchy and I loved the herbs in the crumb topping--just beautiful. Served in a rustic beautiful baking dish. Really quite delicious. My dining partners had the monkfish and the steak--both really enjoyed their meals. We're all dying to go back to try other things. \\n\\nService: Our waiter was absolutely amazing. The best service I've had in recent memory and on par with the best I've received. He was really informative, had great suggestions, and was not at all condescending to the novice beer / oyster eaters among us. He didn't hang out, but checked in a lot. He gave his opinion countered with his palate (I like X, but I like an earthier flavor, etc.). From the moment I stepped into Row 34, the staff was friendly, smiling, accommodating, and generally wonderful to be around. Props!!\\n\\nI have to say...

Having lived in downtown Boston for the majority of the last 15 years I can say that after moving back to the South Shore two years ago, this is exactly the kind of place I think this area needs and what we've been looking for. I am so sick of the same old taverns and pubs and really sick of having to go to Friday's if I want a burger and affordable cocktails.  \\n\\nThis is not a dive bar with sub-par food, it's a cool local pub with great food, for some locals it might even be a bit too out of their league having nothing but chains surrounding the area. We were really pleasantly surprised by everything, the menu, the cocktails and the beer list. For a place like this to exist in Weymouth Landing is great for everyone and if you had a bad experience the first time I would say give it a second chance. our bartender Desiree was great, very sweet and friendly and she makes an awesome dirty martini and Moscow Mule. Event the prices are great, $9 for a dirty martini, are you kidding? Those are 12-13 plus in the city. It can be hard to find well made cocktails in this area. Passport is favorite of ours and this just made the list too. We both enjoyed our meals, lamb burger for me and steak for my fiance. Overall we loved it and can't wait to go back. Their brunch menu looks great as well. \\n\\nI am very particular about where I dine and tend to lean more towards high end places and will pay good money for a great meal, I'd rather spend the money somewhere great than spend less as someplace that is just sub-par or another chain, which there are lots of those around the Braintree/Weymouth area.

Our server was missing in action most of the night. The only times we got to speak with her was when we asked the bus boy to get her attention.\\n2. They forgot our appetizers and tried to bring out our entrees first.\\n3. After they screwed up it took them 15 minutes to bring out two appetizers and then afterward another 40 minutes until our entrees came out again. Our dining experience was over 2 hours long and not in a good way.\\n4. When our food was brought out, the server had literally put one plate of food on top of another, i.e. the bottom of my dinner plate was resting on top of my wife's dinner.\\n5. When our bill came, my wife's 3-course meal [restaurant week] was taken off the menu. We figured this was a nice gesture from their end to comp her meal because of the poor service. We gave our credit card and when the bill came back to sign, the prix fixe price ended up on the bill! I think they never intended to comp the meal and fixed the charge when they realized their mistake. The worst part of this is that they never came back to us to apologize. Either for the crappy service or for the part that they had screwed up on the bill. On a fundamental level it's just wrong to charge someone's credit card a different amount than the bill that was initially presented to them, and that's the most upsetting bit of all. \\n\\nAll in all it comes down to this, the food is good but the dining experience was awful. \\n\\nMeh, last time we're going here.

Sold! But just because food is appetizer-sized doesn't mean you can call it \\"tapas.\\" I'm positive they don't bake their own bread, so much of the \\"tapas\\" are eaten on what tastes like slices of bland HEB baguettes.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\nRoasted garlic - One of the least altered food items, one of the tastiest. I got sort of upset that we spent $3.95 on an item that costs less than a buck to make at home. I guess I was expecting the dish to be altered in some way. It wasn't. I don't think it even had olive oil, salt or pepper on it. The garlic was scorched on the top and uncooked toward the bottom of each clove. Eaten on aforementioned HEB baguette.\\n\\nCurried Eggplant - Edible, but just okay. Again, HEB baguette didn't improve this dish.\\n\\nMussels - I ordered the curry and apple mussels. This was the best dish of the evening and worth $3.95, though whoever prepared them was too rough on the seafood. I kept finding shards of shell in the flesh. \\n\\nSmoked corn and spinach - GROSS. This dish tasted like someone had poured Liquid Smoke into it. I couldn't even taste the corn or spinach. They could have prepared this using any vegetables and it would have tasted the same. (I woke up this morning and still had the taste of Liquid Smoke in my mouth.) Baguette made an appearance. \\n\\nBaked Brie - Again, the least altered from its original state and one of the best-tasting. Basically, someone threw the brie in a microwave and toasted a couple slices of HEB baguette. Not worth $3.95. \\n\\nI feel this restaurant would be most attractive to people who make a lot of money but enjoy venturing into the world of [what they perceive as] the spendthrift hoi polloi by eating \\"cheap\\" \\"tapas\\" served in a strip mall restaurant that looks like it was pulled directly from an IKEA catalog.

Finally, the garlic parmesan & truffle oil skinny chips didn't meet my expectations.  I've had similar dishes before and been bowled over.  This one was over salted and too garlicky.

My server took my food order, later came to ask if anyone had taken my drink order. The girl periodically interupted me asking if she could take this or that dish away, never offering refills. A 3rd person brought my food. I asked if he was the manager, he said he tries NOT to be but asked if there was a problem. He offered no apology but made excuses for the staff, explaining there was a shift change and everybody was confused. As he was leaving i noticed i didn't have any eating utensils.

As a local grad student I'm lucky that it hasn't been overplayed in my social circle and unlike having a song on repeat, I can still evaluate it objectively.\\n\\nFirst, I am never, ever, disappointed with the food. Not only does it taste great, the presentation is also very nice. A favorite is the Spicy Steak Salad but I've ordered a number of other things (and tried friend's) and I think everything is very well done. The Spicy Steak Salad is great because the greens are high quality and the steak is flavorful and does have a kick. Blue cheese is a pretty standard steak pairing and the salsa doesn't overwhelm the simplicity of the salad. I would also recommend the Calamari and Bruschetta appetizers.\\n\\nSecond, Daedalus is a pretty great drink spot. I find that the drinks are reasonably priced (wine, vodka soda, etc.) and I especially enjoy the roof deck when the weather is nice enough to sit outside. Additionally, when the weather is iffy they put out heaters, which is much appreciated!"},{"name":"Famas Pizza and Pasta","address":"5474 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good antipasto, mediocre pizza.

Now that it's open, I headed over with my wife and three year old daughter.\\nThe ambiance is quite nice.  It's not a large restaurant, but there plenty of tables, and seating for about eight at the sushi bar (which has a hi-def TV behind it that was tuned to ESPN when we went).  There are also a couple of booths, which I assume are the \\"sit-on-the-floor\\" style, though I didn't go over to verify.\\nWe sat at a table, and the servers were quite friendly, and had some crayons and an activity placement for our daughter.  We ordered edamame, some tempura, a sushi dinner (standard 9-piece/roll combo, which does include miso soup and a house salad), and some individual sushi as well.\\nThe edamame was quite delicious, as was the tempura (which was a nice large serving, despite it being an appetizer).  The house salad was fairly standard and very nice.  The miso soup was the low point of the meal- It was room temperature and not flavorful enough.  But then the sushi came, which was delicious!  The pieces were normal size (they didn't feel especially large or small).  They held together well.  Oh, and the servers also gave us a complimentary maki piece each, which was a lovely salmon/pickled ginger combination.\\nThe prices are what you'd expect- The standard sushi dinner was $17 (might have been $18, can't recall exactly).  Hot tea was only $0.75 per person.\\nThey have a takeout menu, and also deliver for a $2 charge (minimum $15 purchase).\\n\\nBottom line, I am in love with the fact that there's a quality sushi restaurant right down the street!

It didn't take long to come out either - bonus points for the short wait time. However, it was soggy - couldn't hold up a slice to eat it. It didn't taste undercooked or anything though. The crust was pretty good in a really carb-y way if that makes sense. More like bread you would get preceding your meal at a restaurant. The pizza was very oily, but pepperoni was delicious. Definitely enough for 3-4 people depending how hungry you are.

The eggplant was thin, but overall, the dish was ridiculously good.  The saltiness of the cheese added to the zestiness of the sauce covering the dish.  Make sure you save some of the yummy bread they bring you to sop up all the extra sauce.  \\n\\nWe split a pizza, sausage, mushrooms, artichoke, which wasn't bad.  Good, but not the most mind blowing pizza ever.\\n\\nMy only other issue with the place was that it is just loud, very very loud.

Chic new diner paired with that old school intimate diner feeling, classic comfort food with an upscale touch, yep that's Bananas! \\n\\nLocated in the MIlls50 district, this new addition is welcomed with open arms. Early-morning and late-night hours is a great mix depending on what you are in the mood for.  They serve breakfast at all hrs they are open. Thursday, Friday and Saturday they are open 24 hours.  Yep, I have a feeling after I party it up DT I am going to hit this place up for meatloaf or french toast... heck some nights, maybe a mix of both. \\n\\nLast night my girls and I were craving meat... (insert jokes here). So, we headed over to Bananas and it was packed! Only opening this past Monday it was refreshing to see the support of the local community trying out this new addition.  There was only a short wait since we wanted a booth. There are also tables and a counter in the middle. \\n\\nThey have a nice wine list and upon request you are able to ask for Funky Monkey's extensive wine list since they are right next door.  I went with the Cupcake Resiling, yes... 2 of the best words on the face of this planet.  It was delicious.  We started with sweet potato fries and they were a little overcooked but still tasty and yummo!\\n\\nI went with the dijon encrusted meatloaf with mashed potatoes and veggie of the day, which was corn.  Now I know everyone is not necessarily a meatloaf fan but it is on my top 5 favorite meals of all time.  Next to my personal recipe and my mothers... this one fell a close 3rd and that is HUGE.  It was so tasty and cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes and corn were a wonderful pairing.  Check out the photos... I basically licked the plate.\\n\\nAs for dessert, I was pumped to order a milkshake, however, they will not have ice cream until next week so don't get your hopes up for a lilttle bit.

I think the cheese on the Doria takes a little away from the curry, so I prefer the regular curry.  Especially if you're in a hurry, you don't want to wait for the 10 min baking time.  The regular beef/veg curry takes 2 mins.  Next time, I will have the beef curry, that's what my Japanese friend said is the best.\\n\\nBy the way, the space (previously Bush Garden) is very spacious.

With entrees in the mid teens, and food that is fabulous, Giacomo's is a hit.  I suggest going during off times (middle of the week, or early) to avoid the line.

But the big problem for me lies in the service. Without a reservation, you're nearly always going to wait at least an hour for dinner, and even longer than that on a Friday or Saturday night. While this is often to be expected, the main problem is that the bar and tables are managed separately. So we had to put our name in at the host station for a table, but then also flag down a bartender to put our name on the list for bar seats (and then whichever comes first is what we will take). This strategy was actually suggested by the people at the host station. It seem like this is something they should be able to take care of for you rather than making you jump through hoops. The bar area is actually quite small, yet they seem to need more bartenders, especially as there can be a lot of standees trying to order drinks. Once we sat down (we ended up getting bar seats), ordering was fine, but it took an excessively long time between finishing our appetizers and our entrees arriving. The food was good overall, although I found the fish and vegetables with my entree to me a bit undercooked, perhaps because the kitchen was overwhelmed and were trying to push it out quickly.

There was a huge party taking up a good chunk of the small dining area and that coupled with being short staffed, we probably waited a little longer than the usual norm.   But that's ok. We weren't in a rush and , for the most part, we were all happy with our meals. My husband or and I ordered several appetizers --- potato pancakes and  their scratch made pierogies. Make sure to ask your server what the pierogi options are as they change from day to day. We went with the mushroom stuffed ones which were quite good and even better with sour cream. The potato pancakes came 3 to an order and were scarfed up. So safe to say they were well received.  My husband and I each ordered the same entr√©e, the breaded and fried chicken cutlet with 2 sides. I went with a side of creamy dill potato salad and Kluski noodles.   I really liked my entr√©e however I felt that the noodles were a bit bland. I think they would be great with some sort of sauce. Or maybe we could be given that option.    When dessert time came, we only had 2 choices since they sold out of everything else. So if you have your heart set on a certain dessert item, I would recommend checking with your server and ordering ahead of time. Luckily, the Lemon Marscapone cake did the trick....I'm not normally a lemon person but it was really good especially the creamy lemony frosting. 1 piece would be enough between 2 people but we ended up ordering one for each of us so we would have leftovers.

Nestled in the heart of west midtown, Antico offers an intimate experience in Neopolitan dining. The pizzas are perfection and range from $20-27 for a pie that easily feeds two. All the pies sounded great but the Sophia and its white truffle oil were too irresistible so I ended up getting that. The food is great on it's own, but what really stands out is the atmosphere. The main dining area consists of about four communal dining tables and a couple of bar tables in front of the kitchen and ovens. It's also byob so you can bring your favorite six pack or bottle of wine to accompany the meal. The pizzas come out really fast, within ten minutes of ordering and the servers are really good about clearing tables to get other people seated as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the short wait time for food leaves you with less time to find a seat at this often packed, seat-yourself establishment. On the bright side, there's plenty of street parking on Hemphill and a decently sized parking lot, so parking isn't a huge issue. However, if you hate being surrounded by other people, you might want to stay away during the dinner rush. Alternatively, you can get your pie to go, head east down 14th and make a mid-afternoon picnic of it at Piedmont Park.

Friend had the Bunny Spice smoothie, which was okay but I prefer the Mustang.\\n\\nWhen it came to entrees, I won again.  While Friend's risotto was tasty, it couldn't beat my chosen dish, the Near East Seitan with Teff Crepe.  Yummy chunks of seasoned seitan, wrapped in two teff crepes, with wilted baby spinach, black bean-and-pineapple salsa, and a fenugreek sauce--yum.  The presentation of both entrees was also superb.\\n\\nSadly, neither of us had room for dessert.  But if they're half as good as the Near East Seitan, I would be a very happy camper.

My last 3-4 visits to Antico have been very inconsistent. \\n\\nThis hasn't changed:  it's still not the 'best pizza in the U.S.', it doesn't compare to pies I've had in Italy...but it is still the best pizza in Atlanta, even on its bad days the pizza outclasses all other Atlanta pizza joints by a country mile. \\n\\n2 pies ago: this baby wasn't charred, it was burned. Even the basil was burned. Badly burned...and they still plopped it down in front of me without blinking an eye.  I was surprised to say the least.  \\n\\nLast pie: undercooked crust yet the cheese was browned to hardness. Huh? What a shame. The sauce was still killer though. \\n\\nIs the inconsistent oven work due to the fact that Enrico isn't there anymore?  Who knows...\\n\\nThe customer service problems that are well noted are all true. The girl in front couldn't be ruder.

He was right about that comment, I was treated like a guest in many restaurants in Italy, especially in Tuscany.  Unfortunately....this thought didn't quite translate here at Antico.\\n\\nHowever...if I love the pizza, I don't care about any of that.  So customer service problems aside, I'm still rating this place based on the food, and it's still the best pizza in Atlanta although slipping a bit. Somebody show me otherwise.

But it's not. I got the adobado chicken taco on corn and the tilapia taco on wheat. The wheat tortilla did not taste right, almost rubbery.  The tacos were stuffed with iceberg lettuce (WHY!?), the chicken had absolutely no flavor (the antithesis of adobado), and the tilapia taco was utterly boring. The tilapia honestly tasted like it was marinated in water.  The red salsa I had was good, but it was the only part of the food I liked. And for $2.50 each, these tacos are way overpriced for this town. If I'm going to pay a premium for a taco, it better be UH-MAZING a la Torchy's.

For every thrill ride in IOA, there is one that is just as good at Universal. The Rip Ride and Rock-it was fantastic, lifting you up the first hill at a 90 degree angle and playing music of your choice through speakers built into the seat. The Mummy is also a deceptively cool coaster, throwing you down into the underworld looping through the dimly lit passages.\\n\\nIt also has great immersion-type rides like The Simpsons, Men in Black (high score was 209,000 by my wife) and Jimmy Neutron.

She finally told her family to hold on and she asked if we would like refills. we just asked for the check. she came back with the check and was still on the phone.

The chicken with spinach, prosciutto, and fontina was something I could have made better myself at home. The papardelle with meat ragu was ok, but I had some fatty cartilage pieces which totally ruined it for me. After all three of us complained enough about it taking over an hour and not even coming out hot, they gave us two free desserts to go. Big deal.

It was that good. \\n\\nOn the first night, the three of us ordered quite a bit. We started with their poutine (o.m.g. best thing ever to put in your mouth! It was heaven!) and a few drinks. The poutine was amazing because it wasn't smothered like your traditional poutine. There was just enough gravy/sauce for it to be perfect. Blue cheese instead of curds and I liked the touch of the pink peppercorns although if you weren't expecting it...look out! \\n\\nThe bf and I stuck with Belgian beers (always a good move) and our friend ordered a cocktail from their menu. Per the menu, it was to supposed to help celebrate the Chinese New Year. Yeah no. It really didn't. Although the drink looked divine, it was much to floral to be palatable. It just stayed on the table like a decorative centerpiece. Our waiter at the end of the meal noticed it and asked if he did not like it. My friend said that it was much to floral to drink. He ended up removing it from the bill. Awesome! \\n\\nWe ordered some moules frites (you have to!), the lamb and the duck for our entries. The moules frites do not disappoint. You receive a giant black pot full of heavenly mussels and fries. Ours came in a white wine cream sauce that also boasted fennel and lardons....mmm....lardons. The only problem that I had with Chambar was that they charge $3 for a roll of bread (looks similar to the kinds you find in Mexican bakeries!) that comes with some really off tasting \\"smoked paprika butter\\". Skip the butter. We spent a fortune in bread because of the delicious mussel broth was too good to let go! \\n\\nThe lamb shank came in a tagine and it was fall apart tasty. The only problem that we had with the lamb was that it was tad too cinnamon-y and it had a random piece of baby bok choy in it. But the couscous was delish as well. Ps. Don't spend the extra $3 for the harissa sauce and raita. Although the harissa was good and so was the raita, even though it was more of a raita mousse, its not worth the extra $3...might as well spend it on the bread. \\n\\nThe duck was also divine, perfectly cooked and seasoned. It came with some gala apples that were poached in crack and some butternut squash puree. You have to eat this all together. Although each ingredient holds up on its own, you have to construct what we like to call the \\"super combined bite\\" (tee hee), taking each component and making the perfect bite. Mmm. Was it worth its price tag of $29? Probably not, but still really good. \\n\\nLet's talk about dessert...at first we were not going to order dessert, but after looking at the dessert menu, the boys decided to get some. We ordered two desserts, one chocolate, one not. The chocolate dessert was kind of like a chocolate heaven napoleon, with different layers of chocolate crisps and ice cream. Good, but not amazing. What WAS amazing was the vanilla cake with the raspberry creme anglaise and lemongrass ice cream. Blown away by this dessert. \\n\\nOur second experience at Chambar was mostly for snacks and drinks. And by snacks, I mean another order of poutine. Post dinner, we walked back over to Chambar for drinks and another order of the heavenly poutine. As we were hanging out having fun...Stephen Colbert comes in! Woah! At this point, we have a great buzz going on and we asked our very warm and exceptional server (I think her name was Julie?), \\"If we could send Mr. Colbert an order of the poutine because its the best?\\" And she took care of it! Later we were told that \\"Mr. Colbert sends his regards and that it is indeed 'the best'\\"!

Unreal, really.  I do try to find as many good Chinese restaurants as I can.  Given that I'll be moving soon, I'd better enjoy what I may!\\n\\nFrank Ma's is a homey styled restaurant located in Atlanta's closest equivalent to a chinatown.  It's not chinatown, NYC, but it still has some gems.  This is one.\\n\\nOne of the most difficult things to come to grip with, however, is the thematic variance of this restaurant.  It's the chinese equivalent of an all-American Bistro.  A little northern, a little southern, a bit of Taiwanese, but not a whole lot of cantonese.\\n\\nBefore I go any further, let me tell you that for me, this place is difficult to review, because I've been biased by Dio S., who told me its the best in Atlanta.  Second, someone else reviewed as \\"better than Tasty China\\".  I can only assume she meant when the world class chef was there.  (Incidentally, he's working for the Chinese Consult in Texas.  He's that good, and that well remembered).  The current Tasty China is not worth going to (IMO).\\n\\nWith these expectations in hand, I have to say that the food is well prepared.  It's tasty, inexpensive, served promptly, warmly, and professionally.  It's also home-style.  \\n\\nThe food here is prepared like mom might cook for an army.  In my opinion, it doesn't have the flourish required for \\"couture chinese\\" which is, unfortunately, what I was expecting...\\n\\nMy parents and I ordered:\\nMapo tofu (My test dish for sicuan places)\\nBeef fried noodles (Northern style, no Canto here)\\nPea sprouts (Garlic/oil)\\nChili Squid\\nXiaolungbao.\\n\\nI'll start from the bottom, and move my way up.  XLB's are exquisite things.  They are often done badly.  These are fair.  For me, the skin was not strong enough; a bit doughy and easily broken, and a bit thick for my liking.  The soup consistency was excellent.  Frank Ma's serves things a tiny bit salty for my taste, but the meat and soup left a very satisfying sensation in my mouth.  The vinegar/soy/ginger sauce that accompanied the dish was solid, but not spectacular.  Fresh ginger, in more vinegar than soy is my preference.\\n\\nChili Squid was great.  I had no complaints about it.  The squid consistency was just the right balance between springy and softened by heat.  Still moist and crunchy.  The chili was mild... and a bit salty, but the balance of the dish worked very well.  \\n\\nPea Sprouts were decent.  Again, a bit salty for my tastes, and the sprouts were moderately fresh.  These felt as if flash-stir fried.  Cooked ultra briskly, and not more than necessary.  Good frying technique..  I would've preferred fresher raw materials, but I guess that's my umami focused bias coming out.\\n\\nBeef Fried noodles.  Good northern staple food.  Quite competently fried, again.  Consistent frying technique and consistent flavour.  Nothing shocking, but solidly good.\\n\\nMapo tofu.  I'm in favour of more peppercorn and chili.  There was also use of sour-ish peppers and vinegar that really masked the flavour of the tofu.  Fresh tofu in Mapo tofu can be of any sort, but I'm most in favour of very soft, tender, moist tofu that is slightly sweet.  When covered with liberal peppercorn and chili, the contrast is amazing.  The pork should be the primary repository of the saltiness and chili flavour, IMO.  The variant at ol' Tasty China used black bean sauce/paste which added a deeper, maltier taste to their version (which is non-standard).   Some of you might love this variant of Mapo tofu, but I'm not.\\n\\nI would love for my Sicuan native friends to critique this dish, as I fear that I might be hopelessly biased.  Still, a good mapo tofu can truly make my night.\\n\\n4 out 5.\\n\\nI would've preferred more unity to the menu and food style.  Frank Ma's does what it does really well...

While my wife and I usually get in and out of a restaurant in about one hour, we lingered at Craige for over two.  My wife and I, not wanting to make difficult choices, decided to go with the Six-Course Tasting Menu.  This consisted of 6 dishes, all of which without exception were far from anything I had had anywhere else previously, much less something I would have been able to make myself, ranging from squid noodles (not noodles WITH squid but noodles made FROM squid), to \\"sabre fish\\" and ending in \\"sweetbreads in lobster sauce\\".  I have to admit, I had to look this last one up on my iPhone as we sat at the table.  Turns out, \\"sweetbread\\" is the culinary name for thymus gland.  Maybe I am just redneck more familiar with BBQ than haute cuisine, but this was a first for me, and it was excellent!  Our culinary adventure continued to roasted bone marrow, and although I am not a fan of this extremely heavy dish, I need to take the blame myself, as this was one of several side choices and therefore the only dish we actually ordered ourselves.  Don't be alarmed when you see the portion sizes.  At the end of the meal, between the 3 amuse-bouches, the sorbets prior to the desert and the bread, your 6 courses ends up being more like 8 and you don't leave the restaurant hungry.  Before starting the meal, we ordered some excellent cocktails from the bar.  The only disappointment of the night was, that we had planned to start there, but it was full when we arrived.  Our waiter was superb.  She explained in detail every one of the complicated dishes, that just after hearing them, my wife and I usually boiled down to \\"some kind of rabbit\\" or \\"two types of duck\\" summaries.  Our waiter noticed I was not drinking my beer and inquired if there was an issue.  When I indicated it was OK but not quite what I liked, she immediately offered to exchange it for a glass of wine she thought would go better with the meal.  I declined, but after about 10 minutes, she came back and insisted.  Everyone in the restaurant, from the valet boy who opened the door, to the chef that came out to explain the main dish, were extremely friendly.  We paid almost $280 for the two of us (and my wife had no alcohol after the initial cocktail).

We tried to go here for dinner about a month ago but there was an insane wait so we went elsewhere.

This place makes a particularly good impression for small private events with its upstairs lounge area containing a private bar offering a good selection of beers on tap (if you want to be inside) and a rooftop deck (if you want to be outside). The overall flow is very nice.\\n\\nAs the name implies, this is a sports bar, but unlike most I have seen in Atlanta, the owners spent what must have cost a small fortune converting this older building into a modern, hip bar complete with high definition flat screen televisions, leather furniture and interesting architectural features.  The designers left the brick exposed for a neat contrast of old and new which flows very nicely. Nice attention to detail.\\n\\nAt the function I attended, hors d'oeuvres provided by Stats included chicken wings and a selection of dips such as guacamole for tortilla chips. The food was delicious, fresh and the presentation was well done. The chicken wings were great because they weren't too saucy. In the private room, friendly staff greeted the guests and provided prompt service. Music was not too loud, so you could actually talk to people without screaming (cheers to that!).\\n\\nAll in all, it made for a very nice vibe. If you are planning a networking event or other similar-type meeting, I'd recommend that you check this place out. Given the cool ambiance, I'd definitely return with friends just to hang out and watch some sports.\\n\\nPark directly across the street in the deck attached to the Hilton Garden Inn and Stats will provide validation.  Phillips Arena is within walking distance if you happen to be attending a sporting event there (not close, but not too far away either. We didn't walk from the CNN Center, but I'd estimate that it's about three or four city blocks away on Marietta Street, on the far edge of Centennial Olympic Park).\\n\\nDisclaimer: The evening I visited Stats there was no sporting event going on at Phillips Arena or at the Georgia Dome, so I cannot comment as to what crowd or parking conditions might be like then. Also, since I attended a private event here, I also can't comment on the rest of the menu, so please refer to the other reviews for information on these points."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Wait, what?

The portion was on the smaller end (to be fair it's for restaurant week) and there was barely any taste to it. The filet was extremely tender and flavorful by itself, but the buttery, tiny plate it was served on did not do the dish justice. The cream spinach was very rich and complemented the steak well. Last but not least, the warm bread pudding that tasted a lot like French toast was a nice finishing touch to the meal. The variety of berries served on the side was fresh and went well with the sweetness of the bread pudding. Everything was pretty standard without being mind-blowing. \\n\\nThe waitress gave us the wrong check at first, but she apologized for it.

There were three of us.  The patio was pretty full but there was a table for five that was free.  However, the hostess said that they don't give tables that big for parties less than 4 or 5.  There were three of us on a Monday night.  She said it would be a 20 minute wait.  This was dumb, but we decided to wait and try this place.  When we got back, that table was still free, which made us a little upset that we had waited for twenty minutes and no one had been seated at that table.  We finally were given a table.  Service was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I ordered a beer.  FYI, they have no beer on tap, all bottles.  The waitress never asked if I wanted another beer.  The food was pretty good.  Calamari was excellent, steak tacos were also pretty good.  \\n\\nOverall, I want to give this more than 3stars as the patio is nice and the people watching good.  However, being made to wait 20 minutes for a patio table because 3 people weren't allowed to sit at a table for 5 is unexcusable.  That table they wouldn't let us sit at sat empty the entire 20 minutes we waited for a table and the entire time we ate our meal.  It was a MONDAY NIGHT, and the place wasn't too crowded.  They should be glad we stayed.  Overall, ok food, service leaves something to be desired.

When my mom is in town visiting we always make a point of coming here since they have a pretty big selection of rolls and bento boxes beyond what most restaurants have, so it's fun to come here with a group so you can try a bunch of different things.\\n\\nThe only thing i find iffy is the service. I haven't even eaten here before, but watching the servers wait on tables while waiting for your food still gives you a pretty good idea of it. The servers usually seem pretty brisk and short, and while i don't know Chinese, whatever they're saying when they talk to each other kinda sounds terse and annoyed. Once i came here to get take out during a busy hour so they didn't seat me at a table while i waited... but they didn't tell me where an appropriate place to stand would be either.

The reason for this one star review is that the waiter we had was so... well... inappropriate and unprofessional. There are certain things he did that I could complain about that reflect poor service, but the real reason why I felt compelled to actually write a yelp review is the following:\\n1. He was such a close talker that he could have one hand on my male cousin while his other was on me and his hip was touching mine. And he touched my friend when he walked in.\\n2. He would come by our table so often that he would actually interrupt serious conversation and he would just stand and stare at us waiting for us to give him attention just so he could ask if we liked what we were having (this occurred every five to ten minutes).\\n3. He stood by my cousin asking us if we needed anything one time with his hand in the small of my cousin's back the whole time. My cousin couldn't have looked more uncomfortable. \\n4. He overheard me saying how he was inappropriate, and he thought the most reasonable thing to do was to come over, lean on me with his JUNK on my leg, put HIS hand in the small of my back, and say to me \\"Yeah, I'm a close talker. And I'm not giving it up.\\" I had to tell him \\"THAT'S A BAD THING.\\" \\n5. We got the hell out of there and he never apologized. Oh, and he also admitted to drinking on the job. Is that an excuse? Now we have some seriously choice comedy material to work with but I will NEVER go back to this place. \\n\\nIf I haven't made my point clearly enough, all three of us felt that we were being hit on so inappropriately and blatantly that we just didn't know what to do.

My good friend had been wanting to try Nakato for a long time and we finally went this week. I'd heard so much about it from other Yelpers, and I read all the good reviews about the hibachi and the sushi and all the yummy treats in store for us . . . unfortunately, the only thing I really loved (other than the company, of course) were the delicious noodles that came with our hibachi entrees! Those I'd swing by to get as to-go any time, and I also enjoyed the sauteed veggies that were served with them (zucchini, broccoli and onions - very tasty).\\n\\nWe started with a few items from the sushi menu. The yellow tail was fairly good and fresh, but aggravating to eat because both the fish and rice fell apart when picked up with chopsticks, well before it got near either of our mouths! The same thing happened with the white tuna sashimi. I found the tuna \\"fishy\\" which made me think it wasn't all that fresh. The most disappointing item, though, was the Super Crunch roll - the crab stick tasted really artificial (more than you would expect, knowing that you aren't having real crab) and the roll seemed really mayonnaise-y. There was also minimal avocado, which always disappoints me. I definitely wouldn't recommend this one. Also, a minor annoyance, but one that's a personal peeve of mine, is that they only set out regular soy sauce; lots of places seem to have switched to just low salt or at least have both, and it's much more to my liking!\\n\\nMy friend ordered the steak and scallops and he thought everything was pretty good, definitely generous portions. I got the filet and chicken. My filet was delicious and cooked right as ordered at medium rare; the chicken was your average teryaki flavored meat you would expect at a hibachi place - eh. There was a ton of food, though, way too much in my opinion, with our entrees coming with rice (he got the come-with steamed and I tried the fried but didn't think it was as magical as others' reviews had made me expect), salad, miso soup, etc. A little overwhelming. To top it all off, Nakato is definitely overpriced - the hibachi for sure - especially for someone like me who doesn't want half of the stuff that \\"comes with.\\"\\n\\nOn the whole, I'd probably only go back if a group of friends were going and I wanted to spend time with them. I'd skip any sushi orders. I'd just order the filet instead of a combo and ask them not to bother giving me soup or salad, and definitely request extra noodles!!"},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful experience the service was amazing the beer very well rounded.

The interior is actually pretty big, in my opinion, for places in the North End - not saying it's big, but most of the North End tends to be wayyy more cramped and Antico Forno is actually sized like a normal restaurant.\\n\\nWe made a reservation but still had to wait 15 minutes, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. I guess we waited a shorter amount of time than the people who didn't have a reservation, but probably only by 5 or 10 minutes. The restaurant itself is very loud - its almost hard to hear other people. It seems to be a circular effect - people talk loudly since its so loud, and it just gets louder. \\n\\nThe menu has antipasti, pizzas, pastas, and meat entrees. I had the fettuccini ala bolognese, which had nicely textured noodles in a tomato sauce heavy with ground meat. Portions were pretty good, but they weren't crazy out of the ball park. Pasta was a little pricey at ~$17 a serving especially since portions were not great. I would usually expect to split a pasta with someone if I'm eating in the North End and I had no trouble finishing my pasta portion. I don't really think you could split one pasta dish among two people, especially if they were hungry. The pizzas were thin but have a fluffy crust for a distinctive look. Service was a little inattentive but nothing crazy. \\n\\nI definitely liked Antico Forno. My pasta was pleasantly firm and they definitely had a nice texture to them. The sauce was good too, but honestly it just all kind of felt like something I could have made at home, and it was all a little bit bland. I was smothering my pasta with cheese and pepper flakes before it really tasted like anything.

This place may have your answer. I decided to come to this place on a whim to get some cannoli. When I came here, I was really surprised. \\n\\nFirst off, I was really surprised that there was no queue. Unlike Mike's Pastry or Modern Pastry, you usually would have to wait in a queue to get your pastries and that would take more than 10 minutes to wait for your turn. When I arrived at this place, there was a few people that came in and ordered. \\n\\nI ordered Ricotta Cannoli and Vanilla Custard Cannoli. They were sweetly tasty. I loved how they put in a good amount of sugar, not too much but definitely not too little, giving the cannoli crust a good amount of sweetness. The ricotta cream was great. The texture was soft, creamy, and a good amount of creamy sweetness. It also had the right amount of coolness in the texture. The Vanilla Custard was also a great choice, loved the cool creaminess and the sweet flavor. I would say using rough estimates, that each piece of cannoli is about 11 cm long. Crust was fairly hard, but gave good crispiness with the cream. Two or three pieces of cannoli from this place with either a cup of Cappuccino, a cafe mocha, Indian style masala chai, or Hong Kong style \\"nai cha\\" (milk tea) can make a really sweet, creamy and tasty breakfast or afternoon snack. Each piece is about $2.50, but you may have to pay an extra $.50 more if you want the crust to be covered with chocolate. \\n\\nAs for other pastries, I had a couple of macaroons, which are these tasty cookies made from almonds and egg whites. They are usually softer and tastier than your typical cookie. I had a regular macaroon and a pistachio macaroon. I would say each piece is about 8 cm wide in diameter. A regular macaroon is about $.50 a piece but a pistachio macaroon is expensive, about $1 a piece. I thought both macaroons were tasty and I did not detect a huge difference in the taste. I would rather get a regular macaroon since it's cheaper. There was some leftover ricotta cream from one cannoli I ate, and I dipped my macaroon on the cream. Ricotta cream on top of a regular macaroon is a great combination, very tasty and sweetly good. \\n\\nThree macaroons and a nice cold glass of milk could make a great afternoon snack, especially if you are a little kid and just finished school and your homework assignment. \\n\\nThe elder lady who seems to run this place was fairly nice and was willing to answer any questions I had regarding the macaroons. I think there is authenticity, because the way she spoke had a very Italian sound to it. I think one major disadvantage this place has is that it is not open late in the evenings, so you may not be able to come here for an evening dessert after dinner. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is a great choice for cannoli in the North End and it's a great alternative if you do not want to wait in the queues for Mike's Pastry or Modern Pastry. I really hope that there will be no queues at this place, the cannoli continues to be tasty, the prices will remain reasonable, and the service continues to be effective. I would not come here often, probably only once every five days, since eating too much of these could lead to bad things to your body and your teeth."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Cafe: Service was fast.

This Rocco's Tacos location is especially big and depending on where you sit, you can have great views of Little Sand Lake. Even though Rocco's Tacos is big odds are during prime dinner time (6:30-9:30) there's usually a wait. When I have been on a wait it's alway been quicker than the hostess says that it's going to be. I recommend though that you try to make reservations in advance on OpenTable. The main reason why I said that Rocco's Tacos is an all-around great Mexican restaurant is because of, not surprisingly, the delicious food! Of course you have to get the guacamole. They ask you if you want it mild, medium, or spicy and then if you don't want any of the regular ingredients (tomato, cilantro, etc.) and then they make it for right there at your table. It's pricy, but worth it! I always gets the cheese quesadilla, which is in the top five favorite cheese quesadillas that I've ever had, and believe me, I've had a lot cheese quesadillas in my day! The cheese quesadilla is very flavorful and the flour tortilla has a good crunchy texture. The hostesses, wait staff, and every other employee I've spoken to here is very nice and friendly. Other positives about Rocco's Tacos is it's convenient location - right near the highway exit and not too far from Universal Orlando, Fun Spot America, i-drive 360, and SeaWorld.

The soup is very, *very hot*...before you say \\"it's soup, it's supposed to be hot\\" you take a sip too big and scald your lips and tongue. And when you bite down into the meat and veggies, you'll feel the hot burn and frantically blow to calm the flames down.\\n\\nAnd before you say \\"well then let it cool down first\\" - because the soup is so hot, you had better eat the noodles right away, because if they sit too long in the boiling broth, they become all soggy and mushy(and it happens quickly).\\n\\nYou get to customize your own little dish of sauces with ingredients such as crushed chilis, soya sauce, garlic and all manner of cool stuff provided at the front.

(See definition of tourist trap). When I got there I was lucky, there was only one person in line. However, after I was there they got incredibly crowded. First of all there is no air conditioning in this place. I'm not sure how a business can legally get away with not having A/C, especially in the city of Hotlanta!  We sat in the front room which was the least hot, but well over 80¬∞. Everyone was sweating.  All they have inside are communal picnic tables, which means you get to sit with a bunch of strangers and talk while you eat your food. The back room where the ovens are was well over 90¬∞. They had mist fans blowing to try to cool everyone down but were not much help. As far as the food is concerned it is WAY overpriced!  $20 for a simple margarita pizza. I asked the cashier how big the pizzas were and of course she did not know even after ringing up about 10 billion of them!! I'd say it was at least 14 inches in diameter. Crust was very thin and soggy and was burnt on the bottom. So about half of the bites that I took tasted like charcoal, obviously not a good taste for a pizza, specially one for $20! The pizza had hardly any sauce or cheese on it; it was mostly chewy dough. The sauce was made with San marzano tomatoes (canned) and there could not have been more than 4 teaspoons of sauce on the entire pizza! The mozzarella cheese was really good however there were just a few glops. I had to get up from my table and walk to the kitchen to ask for an extra cup of tomato sauce because it was so dry. I also shared a cup of olive oil with someone at my table and dipped my pizza into those cups; if I hadn't it would not have been edible.  There are no waitresses; they come by to take your tray away (no plates). I had a can of San Pellegrino sparkling pomegranate for $3. It was not very refreshing considering we were all sweating like pigs.  Since the pizza was so expensive and the fact that I'm phat, I forced myself to eat the entire thing.

Our points of comparison are the classic pizza joints in NY (Lombardi's, multiple \\"Rays\\" and Grimaldi's). Neither of us have had pizza in Italy so I can't compare Antico's style to true Italian pizza. To our tastes, the crust was underdone, very soft and not at all crisp anywhere near the middle yet it still had quite a bit of char. Now we like some char and generally love coal fired oven pizza for the unique flavor imparted, but the combination of underdone but burnt dough, just didn't work for us. The sauce and cheese were good and I think I would have liked the pizza much better if it had been cooked slightly slower to allow the crust to firm up without being so charred. My first two visits had been better but I have never had that \\"yum\\" moment at Antico.\\n\\nClearly most reviewers seem to be very impressed so our pie may have been an anomaly or its just not our style.

Simple, good, and fast is the game.\\"  He's certainly meeting those goals.  My Pad Thai (chicken) was excellent in its simplicity, it hit the table less than five minutes after I ordered, and it really did hit the spot.

The experience would undoubtedly have been better if I'd gone with a few friends and ordered a la carte. That said, the set menu is required for groups of 12 or more and they have group seating, so it seems like they should be prepared to provide groups at least an approximation of their usual food and service.\\n\\nI began with the foie gras de canard and truffled french toast with a kriek granita. I had no idea what the kriek granita was, as I've had more interaction with the server at a McDonald's drive-through. When it arrived at the table, it was a solid ice cube. I flagged someone down and politely asked how I was supposed to eat it. The server brusquely replied that it was a palate cleanser, to which I replied yes, but I can't seem to actually make an impact with my fork or spoon. She said their freezer does that sometimes and she'd look into it.\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, I reminded our server about the fact that I literally could not eat the part of my dish that was supposed to cut the fattiness of the foie gras. She took it in back where they smashed it for me with a hammer and brought it back in frozen chunks. Freezer burn, crystallized, ruined, but would have been tasty if it had arrived like it was supposed to. \\n\\nThe rest of the dish was decent, but clearly relied on the (failed) granita to stop it being too heavy. The truffled brioche french toast was tasty but truffle-free and the foie gras was on the bland side. Not worth whatever they had to do to the duck.\\n\\nFor the main, I chose the steak (sorry, \\"l'entrecote grille\\"). Ordered Chicago rare, brought to the table with a \\"Here's your medium-rare steak\\" (work on those communication skills, folks), turned out to actually be Chicago rare albeit with twice the char I've ever had elsewhere. Did the kitchen take it as a challenge? What should have been a bit of char was a thick coating of charcoal which left the whole steak bitter and at times verging on inedible.\\n\\nI am not the kind of person who sends food back, and I already felt weird and guilty about the ordeal with my appetizer. I shut up and ate the steak and its accompanying bernaise. The sides were alright except for puddles of a weirdly over-spiced sauce and the fact that what was described as \\"pomme Anna\\" on the menu was actually a deep-fried mashed potato thing. Pommes Anna is a classic French dish consisting of a cake of layered thin potato slices. \\n\\nLastly, I chose a dessert which turned out to be the wrong one (I tried a bit of my neighbour's and it was fantastic--but it's hard to mess up chocolate). An unbearably thick, bland cube of cream mousse, a spoonful of apple sorbet which melted immediately, some sort of cookie bottom, and a pretty sugar decoration which tasted like nothing.\\n\\nThis entire meal took three hours.\\n\\nThis was made interminably longer by the fact that the dining room was so loud I could barely hear the person directly across from me, let alone hold a conversation with someone down the table. Clearly the restaurant is not able to deal with groups at all, but that didn't stop them from adding an automatic 17% tip, helpfully hidden on my bill as a \\"service charge\\" so the card reader could ask me if I wanted to leave a tip (wonder how many people they've successfully gotten to double-tip? I almost gave them my usual 10%-for-bad-service tip on top!).\\n\\nTo quote the great Dionne Warwick: \\"I got your number, hussy.\\""},{"name":"Pizzeria Uno Chicago Bar & Grill","address":"Porter Sq","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"sadly i know no better place to get my deep dish fix.

I was glad that I made that decision after coming here for lunch on a Saturday around 1pm. It took about 10 minutes to be seated (in a fairly empty restaurant) and even be acknowledged for service.  \\n\\nMy first impression was not the best since the first thing handed to us was a crumpled up piece of paper with food stains and grease on it. Either print fresh menus for your customers or laminate them or use plastic sleeves that can be wiped off and cleaned.  We were given a brunch menu, which I had not expected, and were told they did not switch to the lunch menu until 2pm. \\n\\nService was extremely relaxed, or serve kept walking away leaving us with unexpected breaks during the ordering process and actually seemed to be encouraging us to just sit and drink instead of worrying about eating. None if us are really drinkers though so that just want appealing or appreciated.  After we finally ordered it took another 30 minutes to get our food. \\n\\nI ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes. I found the biscuit to be rather flat and dry (not a southern flaky biscuit). The gravy was good and had plenty of sausage, bacon and even ham in it.  The potatoes however were almost burned. I had to point this out to the server, which he then offered to replace.  My husband had the chicken, it was tender and juicy. The chicken was not very spicy as some reviews had led me to believe but I could taste a hint of pepper in it. The fries were pretty generic and nothing memorable, just a standard basket of shoestring potatoes. My husband had the sweet tea which he enjoyed, but we had several issues with that as well. When he asked for a refill they brought him a coke instead of sweet tea. We had to flag someone down to get this corrected. The second glass did not taste the same as the first so there appears to be no consistency in how each batch is prepared.  \\n\\nOverall the food was good, the service very spotty and time consuming, and I question what other corners they may cut to save money in the back based on the menu condition. I'd give it another try if I have plenty of time to spare."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Man, I thought Drink was a hipster's wet dream before I came to the Salty Pig and I am now definitely reassessing that opinion.\\n\\nTheir pizza is delicious.

The light here, was definitely much brighter and the environment seemed friendlier and more welcoming (maybe it was just newer). We also got the special; 2 pepperoni and a fountain Mountain Dew. The pizza here was much more crispier and yummier in Davel's opinion and I suppose mine too.

And after last night, I won't be back for a while...\\n\\nEverything from start to finish wasn't right: \\n\\n1.) Thai iced tea was too bland. I felt like was drinking slightly flavored orange milk.\\n\\n2.) The calamari wasn't crunchy as it looked. Too much flour on the outside but wasn't fully cooked on the inside so it tasted floury (?).\\n\\n3.) Indonesian fried rice didn't have the dry, spicy, and flavorful taste it's supposed to have. It was too mushy and bland. The crispy chicken was merely fried chicken fingers. \\n\\n4.) Chilli duck - their signature dish I suppose, had too much sauce. I could only eat the top portion of the white rice since everything at the bottom was soaked in the sweet and sour sauce they had all over the duck. When I read crispy skin, I didn't think they would put the piece of duck in flour and fry it. Like the calamari, I didn't like the doughy taste of it. The duck inside was good, though it would've tasted better if they just fried the duck directly to make the actual skin nice and crispy.\\n\\nThere was not one thing that I enjoyed about last night's dinner. It reminded me of this other time I tried the Tom Yum noodle soup which I didn't like either. I remember the Drunken Noodle was ok.

Tip: they don't take reservations & is cash only (conveniently enough, there's an ATM right outside). The lines get LONG. we waited for about 45 mins outside in the cold - not to mention it was snowing. Once we finally got inside, we were seated very close to two other people. For being so popular, they should really think about expanding the place or opening up another one at a new location. Now onto the food...\\n\\nMy sister is allergic to both shrimp & lobster, so we were very limited on what we could. Their specials for the day had burrata, which was delicious. We also got fried calamari which had the perfect level or crispy & tenderness. We ended up getting the scallop linguini pasta with scampi sauce. It looked very bland when they came out with it, but tasted a lot better than it looked (lol so don't let looks deceive you!). They were very quick on bringing out our food - understandable because there was still a long line outside even when we were leaving. \\nNot sure if I'd come again, but definitely a more touristy place to eat at while you're at Boston. \\n\\nWhy four stars? Being from a different town, I'm not used to restaurants being cash only/long lines (you can't even write your name down and explore).

There's a lot to cover, so I'll break it down for you:\\n\\n1) The wait\\nYes, you will have to wait. On a recent weekend, I arrived with a group of five at 5:30pm. We were inside in about an hour. That seemed typical of most parties, through groups of two and three were able to sit a bit faster. It was chilly, but definitely worth it. We met some very interesting fellow diners in line--great bonding experience with strangers! I suggest picking up something to enjoy while you wait, maybe a pastry from one of the North End's great bakeries.\\n\\n2) The food\\nThis is what really matters! The food at Giacomo's is pure heaven. I was a dedicated Daily Catch fan until this trip, and I do not hesitate to say that Giacomo's is better. I'm not sure which was fresher--the pasta or the seafood! Here's what we ate:\\n-Pumpkin tortellini-sweet nuggets of pumpkin in a firm but light dough. The sage sauce is killer.\\n-Lobster ravioli- salty-sweet chunks of whole lobster meal bound together with strands of mozzarella. The garlic cream sauce is rich, not sharp.\\n-Seafood pasta (mussels, clams, scallops) with white sauce- I make a fine white sauce myself. This is better. The tangyness of white wine and depth of roasted garlic draw out that hint of ocean flavor in the seafood. Simple, but perhaps the best thing on the menu--a meal that dances.\\n-Fried calamari- Tender and juicy.\\n\\n3) The atmosphere\\nNot exactly a leisurely dinner. Between your own hunger and the line outside, you may devour your dinner whole. It's okay, no judgement passed. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, happy to get extra sauce, bread, or water, or just to chat about how awesome the food is. They keep things moving without hurrying the patrons. The stairs to the bathroom are precarious, hot, and loud, but it was clean and comfortable.\\n\\n4) The tips\\n-Don't eat the bread as soon as you get in! You'll need that room for your dinner, and it's much better used to soak up the last bits of delicious sauce from your plate.\\n-Don't get the Parmesan cheese on top of your dish. A matter of personal choice, I recognize, but the quality of the sauce is far better than the quality of the cheese. \\n-Share with friends. That way, you can try more deliciousness!\\n-Have dessert first. Something to eat in line, and I promise you, you will not have room after dinner."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is AMAZING and an absolute requirement if you're in Atlanta.

Next time I will plan on ordering extra spicy, as I am used to intense flavors and lots of water to cool me down, which I didn't need. \\n\\nOverall I had a solid experience, and plan on coming again. They also didn't charge extra for more rice which was nice.

My overcooked eggs and pancakes suffered the same result, which was clearly a case of the kitchen pre-cooking to prevent getting slammed during the show.

I went here for my bestfriend's wedding and we sat in the private function room located at the back of the restaurant.  The setup was quite nice and I really enjoyed the decor, it was sort of industrial with exposed brick and large dim bulbs that hung from a sparse iron chandelier.  There were also very large windows on one wall that gave a good view of the city and the Georgia Viaduct.  We ordered from the Set Menu 2.\\n\\nFor my first course, the Amuse Bouche was delicious as a palate starter.  It was seared scallop, however I thought a bit overcooked (tough on the parts seared), with a slice of chorizo on top of beets really made for a perfect combo. In addition, we had a vegetarian in the party, and the restaurant totally accommodated for him.\\n\\nFor my appetizer I had the Lapin a la Moutarde, which was a sherry braised rabbit in cannelloni.  The rabbit was so tender and sweet, and the cannelloni was so fresh.  The pistachios were a perfect touch with the mustard sauce as well.\\n\\nOnly disappointing thing is that I ordered the L'entrecote grillee (Okanagon Angus steak) for my main course and it had blue cheese on top of it.  I know blue cheese is actually trending right now, however, I do not like blue cheese, and nowhere in the menu's description did it say blue cheese.  But it's my bad, it's listed as Roquefort & green peppercorn butter, so I didn't know.  The crisp kale chips were a nice touch and there was a small salad of microgreens, as well as a slice of bread topped with cherry tomatoes and baby onions.\\n\\nMy last course was the meringue au citron.  Yes, this was perfect, and also worked as a palate cleanser.  I had paired it with really good coffee as well, very dark delicious coffee that I actually didn't need to put creamer into because it was so good.\\n\\nOverall it was a very good experience, service was top notch.

The establishment is small, when you walk in you are greeted by a takeout counter. There are tables and booth seating around to the right side towards the back of the restaurant. Each time I have been here our party has been the only one in the place. I do have to say that the owners and servers are always friendly and attentive. But the decor is simplistic and sometimes has piles of papers, etc. stacked on back tables. It reminds me of most small chinese takeout places. \\n\\nHappy teriyaki is a fusion, offering Japanese and Chinese dishes. I have sampled both. The biggest complaint I hear about Happy Teriyaki and their dishes is the presence of onions. Most people say they can barely find the meat because it's just smothered with saut√©ed teriyaki onions. If you can get past that the meal itself is good. Their fried rice is good, and they have a decent miso soup. But I am sure for many people that the onions would be a dealbreaker. I have not tried their sushi as I usually eat sushi and bigger and cleaner establishments (weird about my sushi). \\n\\nThis is the type of restaurant that I \\"feel\\" for.

To me, I can't really distinguish excellent Thai from normal Thai since it all tastes the same to me (noodles, curry, shrimp, and veggies... remix and repeat) but of all the Atlanta Thai restaurants... I guess this is one of the better tasting.  I had the Pad Thai last time and it was decent.  What can I say? It's not Korean food...\\n\\nAnyway, the food was pleasant but that's not all there is to a restaurant.  The ambiance was pretty good, it's a quaint small restaurant (capacity 50 or so and even I thought that was really pushing it) with a good sized crowd, good noise level that's not too loud, and good lighting/space.

It's inconvenient to them to deal with so many people but come on, you're getting a lot of business for your restaurant and it's not uncommon for restaurants to deal with big parties like that.  \\n\\nThey refused to split checks so we all paid via credit cards, pretty much everyone splitting equally and putting the same amounts on each credit card.  Pretty simple, if you ask me.  For some reason, this REALLY boggled the waiters and they could not perform the simple math (if there was any) to get us out of there.  I think there was a case of ONE couple asking to put twice of the amount on one credit card, but other than that, the amounts were the same per credit card.

Wow,ÔøΩ?so Detroit style pizza was explained to me by the bartenderÔøΩ? who also guided me through their fantastic choice of beers on tap.\\n\\nThe pizza is delicious I will not attempt to describe it, but I will suggest you give it try. \\n\\nDelicious. \\n\\nWhat you should know: There is a parking lot. There is also a patio and the inside is industrial and airy and big. The bathrooms are immaculate. They do have a bar with about a half a dozen beers on tap, listen to the bartenderÔøΩ?she's great at suggesting. \\n\\nVia 313 Pizza accepts credit cards."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Visiting from NYC. I had high expectations for this place with the great reviews and being in Eater38 but I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The prices are NYC prices but quality was subpar. For a $34 lobster roll it better be brimming with lobster but it was tiny. The Gravlax on our avo toast looked dried out. They forgot to serve us our ceviche. Shrimp cocktail didn't taste fresh to me. Maybe it's because it's a Sunday and I know the general rule is no seafood on Sunday because freshness lacks. See my picture for reference. I don't think I can recommend this place for the food. The vibe and design is cool in the seaport area. They definitely spent some money on this build out.  Service was good.

The pizza is pretty good, but it is not worth the price + experience combination.  I'm happy to pay if something is worth it, but Antico Pizza is NOT worth it.  \\nOh, and lets talk service.

It's funny how I've been to the Aquarium so many times, but never noticed this little restaurant right across the street from the parking deck.  Speaking of Parking, there isn't much.  I think most people are supposed to park at the deck across the street and cross Ivan Allen which is a bit chaotic.  We actually found a spot in the tiny parking lot in front of Atlanta Breakfast club, however we were also promptly blocked in by people waiting for food.  It made getting out after breakfast a bit hectic.  \\n\\nSo we arrived on a Sunday morning right around 8am.  The restaurant was only half full and we were seated immediately.  Literally 10 minutes later the restaurant was completely full and there was a wait.  So let that be a lesson for anyone who wants to have breakfast here, aim to get here before 8am or be prepared for a wait.  \\n\\nOur waitress and staff were super friendly, coffee was good.  I got the shrimp and grits and my husband got the fried chicken biscuits, which he wouldn't let me have a bite of, so that tells you how good they were.  Our son who is 16 months had scrambled eggs.  We all devoured our food, it was all very good.  The peach french toast looked amazing and I almost ordered it, but I'm kind of glad I didn't because the table next to us had several orders of the peach french toast and their orders took forever to come out (they ordered before us, and their food arrived after we were finished).  The manager came over to make sure we were happy and the busboy offered us to go coffee's which was great!   \\n\\nOverall I think this is a great place to hit for breakfast before the Aquarium or any of the nearby attractions.

This was met with the uncomfortable fact that we had arrived at 8:30pm and we literally saw someone get their burger 10 minutes after we were seated. I think it's somewhat misleading when you claim to have one of best burger in boston and you can't make more than 18. We figured we were already here and this place is rated 4 1/2 stars on Yelp, it must be worth ordering the regular fare here anyway. So instead of having the burgers we had the grilled octopus, 2x pork three ways, and the sorbet dessert. The grilled octopus was pretty decent except for the fact that we got SAND in almost every bite we had. You would think that a restaurant of this caliber would be able to clean their octopus out properly. The pork three ways was horribly unbalanced and way too salty with no acid to balance it out, especially the rib. The confit was extremely oily (yes, I know it's supposed to be stored in fat) and made both of us feel extremely greasy. The pork belly was not bad, but really nothing special and definitely was a very tiny slice for the amount we were paying. By the end of the dish the flavors were so greasy and overpowering that my girlfriend actually felt sick from it. I am not exaggerating. On a side note, we both LOVE pork and we practically eat pork every other meal we go out, so it's not a problem of not having love for pork. In the end, the we ordered sorbet and it was a huge relief from all that. Again, it was nothing to rave about and I have to emphasize that the pricing for very normal tasting sorbets at an \\"a la carte\\" value of $13 is kind of pushing it. This place is incredible overrated and overhyped.

My favorites were the rib, swordfish lardo/avocado toast, and arrancini.  Close behind was the rabbit carnitas and I appreciate the warm towel provided afterwards to clean my hands.  I'd think they would benefit a lot if they expanded their HH menu with more items from the main menu.  The snacks for the table could easily be split up a la carte style especially considering it's hard for even 2 people to split one small \\"avocado toast.\\"  I feel this would also make the menu more affordable which would help with some of the complaints from reviewers.

I'm upgrading my rating for this business to a full five stars. This is based upon a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner (kaiseki) I had in one of the tatami rooms. It was a unique and wonderful experience and one that I highly recommend to anyone who likes Japanese food/culture or fine dining in general. It's an authentic Japanese dinner that, in my opinion, ranks among the best dining experiences one can find in metro Atlanta due to the sheer skill, talent, and meticulous preparation and work that goes into a full-fledged kaiseki dinner.\\n\\nNakato is as traditional as a Japanese restaurant can get in Atlanta. It's currently the oldest active Japanese restaurant in town. It opened in 1972 and has been a meeting place for Japanese people for decades. When Jimmy Carter was Governor of Georgia in the early-to-mid-1970s, he tried to get a lot of Japanese businesses to set up shop in Georgia. Nakato, being one of the first authentic Japanese restaurants in town at the time, naturally became popular among Japanese businessmen. And it still is today, 45 years later.\\n\\nFun fact: Nakato was founded by Mrs. Testuko Nakato and has been headed by three generations of matriarchs. Today, the restaurant is led by Testuko's passionate granddaughter, Sachiyo (\\"Sachi\\") Nakato Takahara.\\n\\nWhen a lot of Atlantans think about Nakato, they often think of the teppanyaki side of the business (Japanese steakhouse like Benihana). Sadly, a couple aspects of this business that are overlooked are the restaurant's washoku dining room and private tatami rooms, just like the ones in Japan, serving traditional Japanese cuisine. A lot of great Japanese restaurants and sushi bars have opened in the Atlanta area over the last five, 10, 20 years, but none of them offer genuine upscale tatami experiences quite like Nakato.\\n\\nThis restaurant has a true gem of a chef in Yoshifusa Kinjo (executive chef). He knows how to expertly craft a classic Japanese meal. He's worked at Nakato for 25 years and has been executive chef for the last 10.\\n\\nThe four dining options Nakato offers are:\\n\\n1. Teppanyaki\\n2. Sushi bar\\n3. Washoku\\n4. Tatami room\\n\\nNakato has several tatami rooms. Tatami is the type of mat used in these rooms. You must take your shoes off before entering these rooms and you sit on cushions on the floor. The room we dined in sat eight people and there was a hole in the floor underneath the table for us to rest our legs and feet.\\n\\nThe tatami rooms are elegantly appointed with old-world Japanese decor. If you dine in one of the these rooms, you have two options: (1) a kaiseki course dinner, which runs about $100-120 per person (excluding alcohol) or (2) order off the menu for a $15 sitting fee per person. If you're interested in course pairings, many of the servers are formally trained and certified by the Sake School of America and can recommend pairings. Not many other Japanese restaurants in Atlanta can boast they have a staff as well trained.\\n\\nChef Kinjo prepared the following course menu for us:\\n\\n* Aperitif - shiso shochu\\n* Starter - king crab salad with apple vinegar\\n* Five point appetizer - miso-grilled black cod, slow-cooked sea whelk (tsubugai), salmon terrine, fried river shrimp (kawaebi), broad bean (sora mame)\\n* Three point sashimi plate - Japanese snapper (madai), marbled tuna (toro), grunt fish (isaki)\\n* Braised course - traditional savory custard (chawanmushi)\\n* Family-style shared plates - miso-grilled eggplant, assorted tempura, yakitori skewers with sea salt and teriyaki glaze\\n* Sushi course - assorted rolls and nigiri served with short neck clam miso soup\\n* Dessert - green tea panna cotta\\n\\nBeer chosen by the staff was Sapporo and we also had a bottle of Chiyomusubi sake with the high-quality tokubetsu junmai (\\"special pure\\") designation. It was excellent.\\n\\nThe meal was exquisite. Each and every course looked like a work of art and tasted phenomenal. What was most impressive was all the different cooking styles chef Kinjo displayed, from delicately prepared appetizers like the salmon terrine topped with ikura (salmon caviar) to grilled items like the amazing miso eggplant and savory kushiyaki skewers.\\n\\nThe shiso shochu aperitif had a sweet bayberry (Japanese mountain plum) at the bottom. Due to my crustacean allergy, I received a mozuku seaweed starter in place of the king crab salad. It was made with a shingiku edible chrysanthemum leaf and lemon zest. The five point appetizer was a sight to behold. The meaty whelk was served whole in-shell. Again, due to my allergy, I received unagi (eel) wrapped in tamago (egg omelet) with radish in lieu of the kawaebi. The chawanmushi and panna cotta were silky smooth and superb.\\n\\nIn summary, the kaiseki course menu at Nakato is a very special one-of-a-kind dining experience. If you appreciate fine, sophisticated food, this is an experience that is absolutely not to be missed."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"While I have had my fair share of \\"authentic\\" pizza from Italy, I have to say Antico is one of the best I have tasted.

Back home, we don't have a super upscale Japanese restaurant like this, so when we come here each year it's a big deal and we go all out.\\n\\nI love the food here, can't say enough about it.  The services is always impeccable, with the waitstaff being so friendly.  I've engaged them to talk Japanese with me, and they humored me (although mine is a little sketchy).  \\n\\nI almost always get the shabu shabu, although I haven't had a bad dish yet.  They bring out a dish of meat, and another of assorted vegetables (cabbage, onion, carrot, mushrooms of three variety, tofu, and scallions).  They also bring out this kind of chafing dish, and you cook these elements at the table.  If the vegetables seem familiar, they are basically stock components, and what you are doing is building a stock with which to cook your meat and such, and then dip in a ponzu sauce.  It might seem odd, but it's very delicious. \\n\\nDesert has two highlights.  I usually get the green tea creme brulee, but this year I went with the chocolate moose.  The creme brulee is a classic brulee custard with undertones of the green tea, which counterpoint the sweetness, but not overwhelming like a black tea would do.  The chocolate moose was a decadent affair, worthy of a fine pastry shop.  It comes out a smooth oval disc about two inches thick and maybe two and a half longwise.  It's not a huge portion, but all but the most rabid chocoholics would be hard pressed to want more.  It's velvety and rich, with a bit of hazelnut in the middle for crunch.  \\n\\nI visit every year, and I plan to continue."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Really good BBQ, need I say more!?

My dad ordered this, and he was speechless. \\n\\nThe ingredients used here are very fresh. They unfortunately ran out of Toro Sashimi, which I had been craving for the longest time.

The restaurant is located inside the Vinings Jubilee shopping center inside I-285. This shopping center looks like a collection of white and brick houses, but it's really a bunch of shops and restaurants.\\n\\nOur group of 10 visited for dinner on a Sunday evening around 6pm. We didn't have a reservation, but it wasn't a problem. The restaurant wasn't busy. There were three people at the bar and maybe one or two tables taken inside. The hostess was able to seat us immediately inside the dining room at a long table that seated exactly for 10. SOHO is on OpenTable, so if you're planning to come here, book your reservations there and earn free dining points that can be used towards future discounts at any OpenTable restaurant.\\n\\nAs soon as I stepped inside this restaurant, it felt old-fashioned to me. I definitely wouldn't describe the interior as modern, contemporary, nor rustic-chic like so many other New American restaurants around town, but then again, those restaurants haven't been around since the 90s. SOHO has a \\"classic\\" look with a traditional vibe. The restaurant is nice and elegant with a semi-open kitchen, open-air patio, large bar, customary dining room, and a windowy porch overlooking the shopping center. There's not a whole lot of natural light inside the main dining room and bar area. The decor is classy (white tablecloths) and the staff are professional and dressed formally.\\n\\nYou can sort of think of this place as like a dated South City Kitchen.\\n\\nSOHO has an extensive wine list and a food menu that changes weekly. They have wine and tapas pairings. The menu during our visit included salads like an artisan lettuce salad ($7.95) and braised cider beet salad ($9.95); starters such as sauteed Charleston sweetgrass mussels ($13.95) and Thai chicken lettuce wraps ($9.50); a cheeseboard ($12.50); pastas like eggplant lasagna ($18.00) and crab and corn risotto ($22.00); seafood such as seared scallops ($25.00) and sea bass ($28.95); entrees like Springer Mountain chicken ($21.00) and Painted Hills short rib ($26.50); and desserts including New York-style cheesecake ($5.95).\\n\\nEvery Sunday, they offer a $30 lobster boil. You have to call and reserve your lobster by 5pm Friday for consumption the following Sunday. The Sunday lobster special includes a 1.5-pound Maine lobster with corn, potatoes, Andouille sausage, and salad.\\n\\nOur table ordered a variety of dishes including crab cakes ($27.00) and steak frites ($23.00). The pork chop was popular. At least three were ordered.\\n\\nHere's what I tried:\\n\\nStarter:\\n* Tuna Tartare ($11.95) - charred poblanos, Meyer lemon, crisped rice paper\\n\\nPasta:\\n* Apple and Sausage Ravioli ($19.95) - browned butter, crisped sausage, sage, apple cider drizzle\\n\\nMeat:\\n* Pork Chop ($23.95) - fennel and rosemary crust, crispy Brussels sprouts and apples, carrot puree, sweet and sour drizzle\\n* Elk Tenderloin ($35.00) - raspberry mustard marinade, sweet potato gratin, haricot verts\\n\\nDessert:\\n* Classic Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.75) - two caramels and vanilla ice cream\\n\\nIn general, I thought the food was A-OK. There wasn't a single bad item, but nothing was outstanding either... except for the dessert.\\n\\nThe chocolate bread pudding was phenomenal. It wasn't like the typical bread pudding I'm accustomed to. It looked and tasted similar to a compact brownie, but was more thick, dense, and smooth, trending towards fudge. It was rich, chewy, and chocolaty. It was what you'd call perfection. The caramel drizzle and scoop of ice cream were just icing on top of the proverbial cake. If I rated SOHO on this dessert alone, I'd give them five stars. A must-order.\\n\\nThe tuna tartare was good quality. The fish was fresh and overall, this app had decent flavor and consistency. It's not among the best tuna tartare I've had, but it's still worth ordering.\\n\\nThe apple and sausage ravioli was tasty. This pasta dish came with about nine pieces of ravioli. The sausage was savory and served chopped into several tiny pieces. I liked the sauce which was flavorful, but also oily. Not bad.\\n\\nThe pork chops were huge. They were thick, meaty, and had good flavor, but they were also oversalted. The vegetable and fruit sides were yummy and went well with the pork.\\n\\nI ordered the elk tenderloin just to try elk. The elk was cooked medium rare and served sliced into five pieces. The meat was cooked appropriately with succulent-looking red centers. The meat wasn't gamey. It tasted like a less flavorful and more chewy cut of beef. While it wasn't bad, I probably should have just ordered the New York strip steak instead. I wasn't a huge fan of the sides either.\\n\\nPresentation was outstanding all-around. The dishes were plated beautifully.\\n\\nService was terrific. Our server was polite, knowledgeable, and attentive. All main courses were served from the kitchen simultaneously to our large group."},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The Old Mohawk has that more traditional type of menu and atmosphere, reminds me a bit of an Applebee's for some reason too.

The sauce is very creamy and almost has a mustard base, the potato salad maybe had a curry thing going on maybe contributing to the brownish-yellow color, the beans were bland, and the sausage was good it but we must have gotten a really fatty link. I've eaten a lot of barbecued sausage in my life and this had to have been the fattiest.

There is a check in coupon for a free miso soup on Yelp so make sure you use that and the worker let me just use that to get the seaweed salad for free because I didn't want the soup.

They were out of two different kinds of soup that i wanted to get and when the food got here 30minutes after ordering which wasn't to bad all the sandwiches were soggy. They were also completely out of bread rolls for sides.  Overall this was the first time i was ever disappointed with Panera.

Our driver had a bit of a hard time finding this place. It was between Buffalo Wild Wings and Pizza Hut, hidden away from the main road. We arrived around 9pm-ish to this restaurant and I admit, I was a bit worried seeing how there was only one couple dining in this restaurant. But worry not, we were seated immediately and provided a menu and a glass of water. The servers had no issue describing any dish we had questions about.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\nMixed Indonesian Plate Dish  $25 -\\nSayor Soup $4.99 - Shrimp, onion,  tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, potatoes, green beans and green onions\\n\\nI did not realize that when we arrived, they were about to close and were already cleaning the kitchen (that explains the one couple..), so we felt pretty apologetic. I whispered to my partner that they were probably spitting in our food. They only had one chef, and explained that the dish we had ordered was Indonesian, while someone else ordered Mediterranean for take out. In the end, they felt sorry and apologized to us for the dish taking a while. Towards the end of the meal, they offered us free vanilla ice cream glazed with caramel and chocolate. Surprisingly enough, we did not finish our meal and had to take it to go, they even offered us a FREE bowl of rice! Such sweethearts.\\n\\nAside from the meal, the interior was beautiful ! Totally dig that clock behind the cashier.\\n\\nWe ended up going to Magic Kingdom & EPCOT, and watched the fireworks; they were amazing. :)\\n\\nHope this is mobile friendly!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pambiche is amazing.

But after I gave up asking literally 10 employees, I see 3 different employees changing multiple TVs to accommodate other paying customers.

I've always had a great meal and a great experience. Tonight, I was setting up for a dj gig that I have for tomorrow night north of Orlando, and wanted a steak before heading home as I was starving. I love Rachel's steaks, so I decided to drop in to this location.\\n\\nFirst off, I mention when I walked in that I was going to sit at the bar and have a steak.  I still had to pay the $10 admission fee even though I was dining. That's waived at the other location (also should be mentioned that they are run completely separate). So, I pay it and head to the bar. Mind you, at this time, it's 8:58 pm, which comes into play later.\\n\\nI  sit down and I ask for a menu and a non alcoholic beverage. I get the menu and it doesn't really have as many options for steak as the other location does, but I see they have my favourite cut which is a Rib-eye. I order it medium rare and I ask if they have steak fries to go with it. They don't. I ask for sauteed mushrooms, which they were out of before, but they checked and said they had them tonight. \\n\\nThe wait begins. The steak comes with choice of salad and bread. I eat half the salad and 2 slices of the bread while waiting. I finish my drink and it gets promptly refilled. It's now about 9:30 when the bartender explains to me that they had a large group in earlier and they are getting caught up and it should be out shortly.\\n\\nStill waiting. I check the time and it's 9:41. I tell the server that I'm out in 5 minutes if it's not ready and she says they were working on it and someone will be out to talk to me. I'm like ok, whatever at this point. Almost 9:50 and I'm brought a steak. New York Strip and it's brought by the manager (no mushrooms). He apologizes for the wait and the confusion and explains they were all out of Rib-eyes but he brought me that because he didn't want me to go hungry. Mind you, he comped the meal. That was nice, but too little too late. I took maybe 3 bites as I was already over the whole ordeal and it wasn't really cooked well.\\n\\nMy biggest problems are I was charged an admission fee to eat, waited almost an hour for food, and if you don't have what I ordered, why bring me something else instead of telling me sooner that you were out of it? I've never experienced anything like this at the other location....ever. I was even willing to pay for what I had eaten and had to drink as I just wanted to leave at this point. I can't even tell you what the girls were like, but they usually don't hold a candle to the ones at South.\\n\\nI was very disappointed here and should have just made the drive to begin with, but I ended up just going home and I'm still hungry. I doubt I'll be returning to this place, but thank you for trying to at least make amends. I'll never pay an entrance fee to have a meal ever again."},{"name":"Dr. Jack's at the Rose Quarter","address":"1 N Center Ct","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"$15 for nachos with melted cafeteria cheese and about a 1/2 oz. of pork?

The only beer they had was Kirin at a price of $15.95. We were excited until we tasted the beer... It was quite watery. The rice wine was also quite watery and we were surprised to see them pouring it out of a store bought container. It also didn't taste like the normal kind either. It was flat and sweet with a very bitter aftertaste. We had to chug the wine to finish it because at $15 a pot... It's a waste not to. \\n\\nMy relatives from Korea were obviously surprised with the prices and we speculated that maybe they buy a rice wine kit from a Korean grocery store to sell.

The beans and salsa were delicious! This was probably one of the best chips and salsa I've had! \\n\\nContrary to other reviews, the staff didn't rush us to order. They were sweet and very patient and answered some questions we had about the menu!\\n\\nNow the food- we got a variety of different dishes. Shrimp fajitas, carne asada, burritos, enchiladas, tacos, the works! Every dish was way too salty, I think it was the meat itself and not the other ingredients. Overly salty to the point that chasing it down with water helped very little. The carne asada was overcooked. The sopapillas tasted like cheap cinnamon flavored tortilla chips with some whipped cream. Everything just tasted eh. That's the best way to describe it!\\n\\nAlso, the dishes were priced around what you'd expect for a much nicer Mexican restaurant so to me, $18 for shrimp fajitas alone seems a little steep for what you're getting.\\n\\nWould I come again?

Some versions of the Groupon specified Dinner and 4 people, others didn't mention Dinner or the 4 person requirement.  The only consistent requirements on the various descriptions were $60, Scugnizzi's, and dine-in only (meaning we have to physically eat there).\\n\\nSo, we print our coupon and go out for a nice afternoon meal.  Order a few appetizers, an entree and pizza, non-acoholic drinks.  We WERE planning on getting some subs too to bring it up to the $60 value of the coupon.\\n\\nThe meal itself was only OK.  Nothing to write home about.  The calamari was chewier than good calamari is supposed to be.  There was a marinara accident where some marinara got into my wife's glass, but when I point-blank asked the waiter for a new glass, he stood there looking at me, so she had to keep drinking out of the dirty one.  The thin-crust pizza was only a step or two above the quality of frozen pizza.  The chicken piccata was alright, if a bit mild on flavor.\\n\\nAfter the meal, before we've actually gotten our subs, we're informed that they will not be accepting the groupon.  They claim it's only during dinner, minimum 4 people (despite that we did order FOOD enough for 4 people).  Reminder: various versions of the coupon during purchase process didn't include those requirements.\\n\\nThe waiter refuses to take it.  They call the owner, who comes down himself.  I have to explain the coupon issue to him for 20 minutes, and he consistently dismisses my point.  Now I'm being stuck with a bill for $40 (and the waiter tried to charge me $55, by the way, and apparently something similar happened to another couple right before us), when I've already paid an additional $25 through Groupon for the meal.  The owner offers us a very sparse compromise, where I still wind up paying a lot out of pocket.  I took the deal mainly out of frustration and being unable to do anything more.  He didn't care that somewhere in the process, I as a customer was getting screwed out of a deal I'd already paid for and given the run-around.  I don't take very well to false advertising.\\n\\nThat, and being up half the night and throughout the morning with food poisoning.\\n\\nTo sum up:  moderate food, sketchy business practices through Groupon, and food illness.

I was getting full (the portions were fantastic), or I might have taken her up on the offer. \\n\\nDespite the sea bass being not to my taste, the polenta side was perfect. I also got my fair share of my boyfriends amazing, juicy and savory steak. Unbelievable meal, excellent service, and a warm, generous atmosphere.

We were lucky enough to sit at the Chef's Counter, so we could watch all the magic happen right in front of us.  Due to the size of the space, a lot of the actual cooking of the food happened elsewhere, but the plating was right in front of us.\\n\\nThe menu changes throughout the year, so it doesn't really matter what we had, as you'll likely have different food. Definitely follow them on Instagram to see what they're cooking up; they also post last minute reservation openings there, too.

The man helping me was also scolding one of his workers yelling at him to finish something or something along those lines in front of me which was uncomfortable for me and disturbing because the gentleman was working hard from what I could tell. Then the food. My burger and onion rings came out. Onion rings were over cooked and fryer in old recycled oil. The came out like a dark Carmel color and tasted horrible. Burger had to be a frozen patty it definitely wasn't fresh meat by any means. The bar with condiments had some issues as well. Lettuce was sitting in a bed of water making it wilted.

They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right. \\n\\nNow besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices. \\n\\nNow seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!) \\n\\nThis place is a must try for everyone.

In our group, people were saying that even at the Richmond night market the pancakes were bigger. \\n\\nThe weirdest part of the whole experience was the man who was pacing the restaurant. At first I assumed it was a customer who was curious as to how they make the pancakes since he kept looking into the windowed kitchen. Then we realized he must be a manager/supervisor since he would go into the kitchen and talk to the front counter staff. He did no work at all. No clearing tables, no running food, no greeting guests or showing them to a table. Literally just paced the restaurant. Even when our food order was up, he stood between our table and our food and watched as we all had to get up to grab it. ?!?!?! What kind of manager is this. \\n\\nAnyway, I'm rating it the 2 stars instead of 1 because the presentation was pretty and the restaurant was clean and well decorated.

Be warned: the plate is hot to allow the steak to sizzle in the puddle of butter. The mashed potatoes also complemented the steak very well. If there is one add on that you must include in your meal, sweet potato casserole is your best friend because it is like having a dessert before the dessert comes.

They had a lot of sides to choose from, which I really appreciated since I have a few food allergies. The fries are fabulous, so crisp and light. I also loved the candied yams and greens.

It's so easy for meat dishes to taste good, sometimes it's hard to taste the difference between a decent burger and a good burger (maybe?); and a lot of the time, people stick bacon into dishes, cheating their way into what they think is a good dish. (Everything with bacon in it tastes good, ok?)\\n\\n[Sorry for my prelude, but that has to be said, especially since the dirt candy cookbook (http://shop.dirtcandynyc.com/) has taught me to appreciate this kind of stuff!]\\n\\nAnd so, the experience:\\nI suggested Red Lentil to my hubster this past Friday because we observe Lent and avoid meat on Fridays. We ordered a beet/potato pancake to start off with (it was very beety), I ordered the Nirvana entree dish, and he ordered some Italian inspired dish. Both our dishes had a HUGE slab of Tofu on it. Each, we thought, were both flavorful but we were SOOO full at the end. Personally, I felt my dish reminded me of a dish I had at Life Alive (http://www.lifealive.com/), so I definitely enjoyed it, but then I felt like I was struggling with the tofu towards the end. Overall, I thought everything was flavorful, but probably a LOT of food. That's actually a good thing, since most vegetarian dishes always leave me hungry, but this place didn't, so I applaud them for that. The reason for the 3 stars (which I really mean 3.5) is because it just didn't have a lasting impression on me. I don't feel like I *need* to go back, but I wouldn't mind trying the other dishes at this place out.\\n\\nThe place is really cozy and doesn't have that much space, so you may have to wait for a table!

I still do think it's a bit annoying that the bar area can get extremely crowded due to the layout of the restaurant. Just know that's something to expect if you're going on a weekend evening. To start, I ordered their homemade kombucha because it was very hot outside and at the time it sounded more refreshing than a beer. I know, it should be a sin to step into a restaurant with 2000 beer offerings and order a kombucha. But it was absolutely delicious so I don't regret it. Of course we ordered the pull apart pretzel because you literally can't not order that. It's so FREAKING good. Holy cow. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. For my meal, I ordered the mussels. Not sure if this was a seasonal offering that's not typically on the menu but if it is - I AM BEGGING YOU TO KEEP IT ON THE MENU. Omg these were the best freaking mussels I've ever had in my entire life. I'm not even the biggest fan of mussels - usually more of an oyster/scallop gal. HOWEVER, the sauce for the mussels was sooooo amazing and refreshing. It was a spicy Thai coconut/lemongrass sauce. But it wasn't thick - the perfect refreshing consistency. I give props to the cook on this one (along with the pull apart pretzel of course). Also, the vibe of the restaurant is super cute and the prices are extremely reasonable.

The Macaroon was fresh and delicious.  The coffee itself wasn't the best I have had.  I don't think I would suggest a coffee only option, but with some almond milk over ice it was tasty.  They roast their own coffee on site, and you can even view the roaster as you enter with their bags of coffee beans that you can purchase.

I absolutely loved both of my experiences here. The staff is wonderfully nice and polite. We had a group of over 20 people and they did their best to accommodate and were very patient with us.  The venue has a nice \\"Texas feel\\" because you're out in the countryside, it's wonderful for a sunny afternoon lunch or a cool relaxing late night dinner. It's Bring Your Own Beer which is cool, or you can pick up a 6 pack at their liquor store. Nothing hits the spot like a nice crisp beer with some brisket.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the food is spectacular. I normally get the AYCE. Their brisket is phenomenal, perfectly made, flavorful, and juicy. Their sausage is my guilty pleasure. You wouldn't think that you'd find yourself enjoying sausage of all things while at a BBQ place, but it's sweet and has a nice snap and bite. Their pork ribs are really enjoyable as well as I find myself eating like a dozen of them. If I were to come back I don't think I would do AYCE, I'd probably just get the sampler that gives you a portion of all of those meats. Their portions are very generous and unless you plan on eat one meal for the entire day, I've come to learn that AYCE is a little overkill. The slaw is pretty refreshing and tasty and I appreciate that it's not caked in mayonnaise. Oh and they give you free pickles which essentially is the best thing that could ever happen at any restaurant.\\n\\nThe wait-time can be pretty horrendous if you don't come here either early or if you're with a huge group. It's cash only and this can be very inconvenient for a lot of people.

If the hogzilla was supposed to be somewhat of a twist of Vietnamese food, it wasn't at all except for the minor flavor of the pork belly. The inner harbor could use more crab meat.

The place itself is on the smaller side, but does have a nice, cozy aspect to it. I do like the deep red, leather couches that align the walls. We were seated to the far right of the restaurant near the windows on a table for 5, but we barely had enough room for all of us. I will give them props for their open kitchen concept, I had to walk past it to find the bathroom and I did think it was pretty cool. \\n\\nTo begin, I thought their wine selection was a bit lackluster. I began with a glass of French white to start (the only option was Chenin Blanc). The wine was okay. Then we ordered the crispy fried nova scotia smelts to start with squid ink ancho√Øade on the side. They were good, but nothing I would rave about, just crispy fish with some thick squid ink sauce. We also started with roasted beef bone marrow, which came two to a plate with lots of roasted pieces of bread. I don't eat bone marrow, but it looked like a pretty legit dish. \\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the confit and roasted milk-fed pig's head, which came with bibb lettuce and hoisin sauce so you could make your own little lettuce wraps. I liked the concept, and even though I don't eat pork, the dish looked pretty solid. We also ordered the whole-roasted chicken which came over what seemed like quinoa (or rice) and some squash with a bit of yogurt dressing on the side. The chicken itself was done well, but I felt it needed a bit some sauce, so I grabbed some olive oil and used that along with the yogurt. (I also get a little freaked out when I see chicken legs and feet on a plate, can I just have the meat?) We also ordered a burger for the table (which is apparently known as 'the most amazing burger in Boston') which came with a few thick cut, fluffy french fries. (Again, don't eat beef, so I didn't try it). \\n\\nMaybe because we ordered a ton of things I wouldn't eat or the fact that I wasn't in charge of ordering that I have a bit of a negative view of the restaurant, but I really expected better.

Maybe a menu above the beverage coolers. They have 4 registers so ordering was easy. Perhaps a sign order here would help. My review is based soley on the food, not the abundance of help. 8 employees behind the counter. I ordered a Dinner plate which included half chicken, yellow rice with ham, red beans with cubed potatoes and sweet plantains.  I was surprised the amount of food for $6.99, enough for two. The rice was a bit over cooked, mushy and a bit salty. The red beans with potatoes was delicious. The sweet plantains were good. Now to the horrible chicken was so dry after two bites I returned it for the stewed chicken. The stewed chicken was also dry, not moist like my Mom used to make. Now to other points not related to my score. Where I understand the need for the glass partition separating food from customers its so impersonal. It felt like I was in a bank not a restaurant. Half a glass with a counter top would make more sense. Also with so many employees those not doing anything should interact with customers...how is everything, can I interest you in dessert, can I get you a napkin or another beverage? And most importantly being someone who eats out about 150 times a year. To owner when anyone complains about the food have someone apologize, fix it, comp it, offer a free dessert or coffee and management should always get involved. None of which happened.

Fearing the lactose, I was hesitant at first.\\n\\nIt is located where Jaqbo used to be on Hemphill Avenue and pretty much right where I used to live. Great little spot that will hopefully attract people who are tired of Pizza K, Papa Johns and Rocky Mountain down the street.\\n\\nThe first good sign was the people working here were speaking to each other in Italian. Better than the Spanish you usually get around here. Before I could even step up to the counter the guys were welcoming us and shaking our hands. The owner's son came out and started chatting with us too.\\n\\nWe ordered the Margherita D.O.P. We debated taking it to go, but they told us we could eat it at the counter they had set up by the front window. Best decision ever. Kit started eating his first slice and wet himself. The owner, Giovanni, came over and introduced himself to us and asked how it was. Kit was barely able to speak he was so busy stuffing his pouch. I told him I needed to wait to eat until I had a Lactaid and he informed me that the cheese they use contains no lactose. Beautiful.\\n\\nI immediately grabbed a slice and gorged myself. Amazing. My hands were dripping with sauce and I licked up every last drop just like when I pour frosting on Ivan's mom. The crust was spectacular. I love charred crust.\\n\\nAfter a couple slices Giovanni took us in the back to show us the operation. First thing you notice are the three giant ovens and a stack of wood to burn. The whole front of the place is glass so you can see in on the ovens and the table where the dough is made and kneaded. Giovanni said he has nothing to hide and wants everyone to see he uses good ingredients. Very cool.\\n\\nAll of his ingredients are imported from Italy. No canned tomato paste here. Giovanni is a very passionate guy who loves what he does. He personally makes the pizzas. We could definitely tell this was his life, not his job.\\n\\nOn our tour in the back they offered us some beers. It was like we were part of the family. Very warm and hospitable. Giovanni made us two more pizzas, another Margherita D.O.P. and a San Gennaro. The sausage was amazing. I need to try the calzone next! By this time Kit had recovered enough to get Jen (Blissful Glutton) off of her couch and over to try as well. She shared our reaction to the whole experience.\\n\\nI am so glad this place is so close but am afraid I will end up being 300 pounds like Kit and Ivan."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely subpar.

The inclusion of Feta cheese was not welcomed, so get it without and you'll be fine. 3 types of meat on it and rice makes it a full meal in itself. \\n\\nThe Fried Mac & Cheese balls were delicious, but the \\"Caraway\\" sauce included was not good (think of a horseradish-ranch hybrid); if it came with regular ranch, it'd been fine. \\n\\nThe Sweet Potato Tots were interesting...probably not my favorite but the Sriracha Ranch sauce it came with was really tasty (use that sauce for your fried mac & cheese balls)!\\n\\nI only had a taste of the Cajun Crab & Shrimp Pasta, but the flavor was an awesome blend of the pasta and cajun spices.

The food, atmosphere, and service are fantastic. That said, if you have Celiac or are allergic to gluten, be VERY careful when eating here. I learned my lesson the hard way. I got \\"glutened\\" last night and don't feel so great today.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the servers and staff are extremely knowledgeable about which menu items contain gluten and can advise you accordingly. And, the menu is actually pretty gluten-free friendly. Most of the items don't have gluten in them. The problem is with the MENU itself. It doesn't tell you EVERYTHING that a dish has in it. In this case, it was the Chicken Milanese. It was lightly breaded but there was no mention of bread on the menu. We had two servers. I told the first one I was allergic to gluten but failed to mention it to the second one so when we ordered this dish, he didn't warn me because he didn't know he needed to. Not his fault. Anyway, I ended up eating some because at first, it wasn't obvious that it was breaded. I realized it after I had ingested it unfortunately. I will now be sick for several days... :(\\n\\nThe servers' response to this mishap was flawless, however. They apologized, of course. They didn't charge us for that menu item and promised to improve their communication when a person with a gluten allergy comes in. That's the best I can hope for, really. And, I should have been more vigilant, too. \\n\\nMy unfortunate incident aside, Barcelona is really a great place. The menu changes frequently (daily I think?) but you can't go wrong with any of their steak tapas plates. They are always good. The service is some of the best in Atlanta. I've been here several times and everyone is extremely nice, helpful, and understanding (about my food allergy).\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they really do need to fix their menu so that all ingredients (especially BREADING!!!!) are listed in the description of a dish.

Drinks: If I was only reviewing the drinks, Brewer's Table would earn 5 stars. I had a small pale ale that was delicious. It was nice that they offered multiple sizes so I could just try it. Then I had the Hopped Paloma which was a paloma with citrus hopped syrup in it -- wow, an IPA and tequila enthusiasts dream. \\n2. Food: Food was only meh. We ordered a meat cheese plate and caesar salad to share to start. The meat and cheese plate was $26 which is pricey but reasonable until we saw what was on it: prosciutto (yum), honey ham (cold cuts from the grocery store?), and lardo (basically the fat from the prosciutto), a lot of blue type of cheese, and a very good manchego-like cheese. Sides were good however we only liked 2/5 of the meats and cheeses. The caesar salad was just creamy leaves; I don't think the dressing had any flavor. Finally, I had the scallops which were very, very good but not enough to redeem the price point of the meal. \\n3. Service: This was honestly the worst part. Our waitress was nice enough but Austin has so much good food that service really distinguishes the price points for me. First, the waiter who dropped off the meat and cheese board didn't explain ANYTHING on it to us -- that seems like a very standard thing to do. Then when we finally asked, he had a really specific recommendation on how to eat the lardo -- dude, if that's important, tell us. Then, the waitress asked us if we needed more bread to finish the board. When we got our bill, she had charged us $6.00 for it.

She did.  The bread was Awful... not good for an Italian restaurant.  My dish was AWFUL, very little lobster, small pieces and I suspect it was logastini.  I had just a few bites.  My friend had an arugula salad with salmon--first piece of salmon sent back--way too well done--got the second piece, a little better, but very fishy---and the greens and dressing were so salty!!  So told our lovely waitress , she was nice, that we were very disappointed, and she could see we ate hardly anything.  They comped our entrees, then we chose a dessert, ice cream ball covered in chocolate, so frozen, it did have a candle for us, but we had to wait about 4 minutes till it melted somewhat so we could eat it--8 dollars and the 2 of us ate about half.

The motto here is \\"Eat Dessert First\\", which may not be so hard to do at any other bakery, but is at Flour because of all of their delicious sandwich options.\\n\\nThe homemade hummus with cucumber, red onion, and sprouts is crisp and fresh, and the grilled roast chicken is served panini-style, with brie, arugula, roasted red peppers,and caramelized onions.  While I personally have never had it, everyone that has boasts about the roast beef sandwich, especially the crispy onions with which it's laden.  No matter which sandwich you choose, be assured that the bread is always fresh.  Flour now also gives the choice of wheat bread, for those looking to be health conscious before devouring a chocolate cupcake or a handful of homemade oreo cookies.\\n\\nOne cannot walk into Flour without wanting to try every single dessert in there.  Start with the cookies and finish with the triple chocolate mousse cake, which practically melts in your mouth.  Be sure to take some mini-tartlettes for the road.\\n\\nLooking for a snack?  The granola bars are a sure bet, with a cranberry-apricot-apple jam that makes them far better than any packaged brand.

We'll 'google' it for you!\\"  Huh?  Shouldn't you know you're own wine??  I have an iphone, I can \\"google\\" it myself.  Also simple in the fact that it took forever to check out as the waiter had to tally up what we had (saw him keep referring back to the menu, taking notes), and then they had to use an old credit card carbon copy swiper (he said their usual machine was down).  \\n\\nBff lives very near here and we are excited to have some cool new places around.  In fact Apothecary is right across the street from Simplicity (and Sampaio's is about a block away too).  There's suddenly alot of dining competition on Burnet Rd.  Simplicity's gonna have to get a little more complex in it's food and service to keep up."},{"name":"Antica Posta Ristorante Toscano","address":"519 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for a friend's Birthday and was extremely disappointed. Our whole night was just bad. We had a large party that she made a reservation for. It was honestly like they didn't know how to handle a group of more than two people. We were seated downstairs at two separate tables. Our server Mercury (yes, that's his name y'all) was the icing on the cake for this hot mess. He was a diva extraordinaire who was remarkably inappropriate the few times he did actually service our table. He spent most of the evening allowing his helpers to do the dirty work. \\n\\nWe waited 30 minutes for bread, over an hour for our salads and a total of 2 hours before we were served our main courses...most of which were lackluster. When asked about the meal upon collecting our plates, I expressed my dissatisfaction with the meal and the service to which the waitress responded \\"ok.\\"  $70.00 later I have a place that I've given one star to that I will never return to. The sad part is, I'm still at the table writing this review and will finish it before I pay my check. I would tip less, but as we know parties over six get automatic gratuity. Touche Mercury, Touche!"},{"name":"Church's Chicken","address":"538 Lee St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Trying to buy food for a homeless woman and the door was locked at 9:30p, door says closed at 10p. Again another ghetto experience on the west side of Atlanta. Drive they took forever and a day to take orders. Where is the manager?"},{"name":"Burger Tex","address":"5420 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I went here once for a team lunch and it's become one of my favorite burger joints. I'm pretty picky when it comes to how I want my burger made so I like the fact that they have a toppings bar where you can add whatever you want, aside from the cheese. The fries are tasty too and I feel like the amount of food you get for the amount you paid is well worth it. You can tell the building is kinda old and it has a kind of old fashioned fell about it, but other than that, it's a pretty good place to eat and relax. My old boss swears by this place and I do too."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"In Atlanta for the long weekend, and found the Atlanta Breakfast Club through Yelp. Today is Labor day and they are one of the few recommended breakfast places that were open. There was a ridiculous wait time (40-60 minutes I believe) so we joined the waiting list using Yelp, and by the time we got there we waited less than 10 minutes. I am very happy that they allow this because our hotel was a bit of a drive, so we gave ourselves enough time to drive and find parking (finding parking was tough, we parked about three blocks away, not sure if this is the norm or just because it's a holiday).\\n\\nOur server was Najah, and she was very attentive despite the busy atmosphere, and she gave very good recommendations. I went and got the chicken and waffles, which were amazing. They seasoned the chicken well and it was very tasty on its own. My boyfriend had the peach cobbler french toast and I had a couple of bites of those, it was served hot and it was super flavorful. We would definitely come back the next time we visit Atlanta."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],j={key:0},D={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(N,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-d3e3db60"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/29.md","filePath":"people/29.md"}'),G={name:"people/29.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
