When we tried to increase our res to 6 to include their 2 sons from UGA, we were told emphatically no way. So when we arrived @ 5:15 and noticed what looked like a line outside waiting to get in: \\"Surely not\\" thought I, \\"These must be people waiting for the valet to retrieve their cars\\", because the importance of reservations had been driven home so emphatically three times by Ray's in the past 7 days. Imagine our surprise, then, when we were told there was a 45 min. wait, which was attributed to so many people lingering at their tables longer than expected. \\n\\nAs Yoda would say: \\"the bulls**t is strong in this one\\". Think about the implausibility of what Ray's told us: what should be a 1:15 to 1:30 hr. meal was being stretched into 2 to 2:15 hours because after gorging on turkey and stuffing, people were dawdling over their coffee and pumpkin pie. A more likely explanation is that Ray's grossly overbooked, cynically relying on the rock-solid logic that there would be nowhere else to go on short notice without reservations on Thanksgiving Day. Or, the place was so crowded that it was taking way longer to negotiate the buffet line. That the wait was even longer was borne home when we encountered a couple with 4:30 reservations who were still waiting at 5:20, -- and they weren't going anywhere anytime soon.\\n\\nFurther testimony to the BS of Ray's explanation was the fact that they had set up a tent in the parking lot to handle overflow, suggesting that they knew far enough in advance to erect the tent (a several hour job, I'm guessing) that they were overbooked. Since they called us, not once, but twice, to confirm our reservation, it seems unlikely that any of this was a surprise. That being the case, one cannot help but wonder why we weren't advised of the situation and told to come an hour later? The only conclusions I can draw are:  they don't care, or are incredibly incompetent, neither of which recommend Ray's or its service. \\n\\nI detest being lied to, even less when it's done so nakedly, as if to say, \\"We don't care what you think.\\" I refuse to patronize establishments with so little regard for the comfort of their patrons, and I will NEVER eat there, and intend to  tell everyone I know to avoid Ray's like an outbreak of salmonella. If I could give them a minus rating I would.\\n\\nEpilogue: We retreated to Marietta Diner, where, without a reservation, we waited 5 minutes in a place where the lobby was crowded and every table was full. We had a sumptuous turkey dinner with all the trimmings, for less than half of Ray's over-priced buffet, left our waiter a 50% tip and got away for $56 for two.\\n\\nAfter posting this, I read similar comments complaining aboutRay's and reservations from Thanksgiving a year ago, and on numerous other occasions. This is a problem that Ray's has made a CONSCIOUS DECISION to do nothing about, other than to call people ahead of time in search of cancellations. When confronted, they offer no apology or offer to make amends. Their business philosophy appears to be taken from W.C. Fields: \\"Never give a sucker an even break, or smarten up a chump.\\" These are truly awful people: they don't care about your patronage, nor do they deserve it."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Saw Mike's Pastry boxes everywhere so we stopped in, it was decently crowded but they move people quickly.

Two minutes after they were able to sit  we got a loud ' ready to order?!' No drinks, no time to look at the menu..I was shocked. We ordered and the food was ok but the service was horrendous. We had to flag the server down to order drinks and we saw him once to check on our meals. Not impressive. After the meal a cappuccino was ordered and another customer at the table banged the waitress and knocked it onto her her new finacee.

While some of the dishes are much better than the others, overall, it's a good place.\\n\\nFrom 11am-3pm, they serve a lunch special for $8.99, which features an appetizer (choose between soup or potatoes), a main dish of the day, and Inka Kola. Today being Thursday, the special was the rotisserie chicken, which came with salad and fries. For the appetizer, I picked the chicken and rice soup. \\n\\nThe soup was warm and comforting, but a little bland. I felt like it needed more salt and more spice, alike. While the lime slice they gave on the side helped a bit, it could easily overwhelm the other flavors in the soup without really adding anything that it needed. The rotisserie chicken, meanwhile, was excellent. The skin was nicely seasoned and the meat was very tender. While it takes the various sauces they provide well, it's even good on its own. As for the fries, they were solid and plentiful, with just the right amount of salt. I'd highly recommend dousing them in one of the hot sauces, as they absorb it well. As for the salad, it was pretty mediocre. Relatively tasteless lettuce and a few tomato and radish slices, served with an acidic, Italian-ish dressing that didn't really do much for me.\\n\\nI'd highly recommend the sauces they put out to accompany your food. The three spicy ones go as follows: yellow = mild, green = medium, red = hottest. I recommend liberal dousing of the yellow on the fries and careful use of the red on the chicken. The green was nice as a middle ground, and had a strongly herbaceous quality to it, but the other two were the better options, between the creaminess of the yellow and the good fresh-chili acidity of the red. \\n\\nWith the combo, you get the famous Inka Kola to drink, which tastes a little like bubble gum, a little like vanilla, and a little like lemon. That said, I'd recommend getting a chicha morada to drink, if at all possible--it's even worth spending on top of the combo. Made from purple corn, pineapple, and spices, it's fruity, spicy, and sweet, and is equally good cold and hot (they served it cold by default there, but I bet they could heat it for you if you wanted it hot). \\n\\nOverall, the good qualities of the stronger items at El Inka outweigh the problems with their weaker items. Come here if you're looking for a big, hearty meal, and plan your meal around the rotisserie chicken. It's their specialty for a reason."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"By far the best lunch place in the area, and my favorite Clover location.\\n\\nThe staff here are some of the friendliest and hardest working I have ever met.

I often polish off my mound of crawfish wishing there had been a few more potatoes and pieces of sausage but oh well, that's my opinion.\\nNote: You do have the option of getting more but you have to pay for it of course and at most other places you get these \\"extras\\" in abundance.\\nWell, this completes my very first review on here!"},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I have never had a bad experience here.

Whipped out the phone and Yelp to the rescue, thanks guys for the accurate reviews. We went for lunch where we were greeted by Rob who explained the menu and gave some great suggestions, along with samplings of a couple of their homemade sodas.  Super amiable, and spot on with his recommendations. \\n\\nFood:We got orange dreamsicle and their vanilla soda with our meals, both very refreshing and with just the right amount of sweetness. Their beer battered shiitake mushroom sandwich and the chickpea falafel sandwich were both amazing. To me the real standout was the fact that every ingredient was of the highest quality, and the best that I've ever had (hummus, pita, falafal...everything was the best that I've had individually, let alone on a single sandwich). We also got their rosemary fries which were amazing, I actually saw the guy drop the fresh rosemary in the fryer... hows that for fresh. They also have various coffees that they offer, french press and chemex. I got a cup of their Thailand coffee and wasn't let down, very bold yet smooth. \\n\\nService/Ambiance: The kitchen is visible to the patrons and very clean/organized. There are plenty of booths, tables and bar seating made with live edge tops, and  a minimalist industrial vibe. Staff were quick to answer questions, and I thought the person out front greeting customers and walking though the menu with newcomers was a really unique touch that I wished more places would emulate. I love the fact that the menu updates with individual times for each menu item every 3 orders so you know what to get if in a rush (I timed our food...creepily accurate). \\n\\nOverall: I'm an avid eater of all things meat and I honestly didn't miss my usual choice of protein one bit. Simply amazing, my wife and I talked about the meal several times over the course of a week. This sounds ridiculous but I almost choked up/shed a tear whilst eating because I was overwhelmed at the pure awesomeness of this place. I'm sure its akin to the 1st time a new parent feels that bond with their new baby...pure unbridled love and the almost simultaneous urge to  laugh/cry at the same time.

Not just small slices but a big piece, a pretty healthy helping.  That was awesome.  Despite the fact that it seemed to be run by non-Japanese, it was decent.  They don't have truly authentic Japanese food but have good quality sushi.  Being close to Boston, the fish was fresh.  There was a good variety of rolls too.

There used to be a \\"wow\\" factor in going to Ray's for the Sunday brunch and that is no longer the case. My mom enjoyed the ambiance, as that was her first time there, but we won't be returning.

We concluded they made it to our \\"best donuts hall of fame\\". These are artesian donuts. I've read about people complain about how expensive these are.. but to be fair, as a baker/foodie/cook myself, I think it is reasonably priced consider how time consuming and labor intensive it is to get the recipe and flavor profile on point. Just try making a brioche at home then you'll become more appreciative and respectful for the bread itself. You can definitely taste the passion fruit then the cacao nibs with a hint of spiciness at the end. The cream br√ªl√©e was really interesting. I squeezed the alcohol in and let it sit for a few minutes. (I ate my other donut while it was being \\"marinated\\") It has a thin hard candy shell, the sweetness was perfect, custard was perfect, and it ended with a subtle alcohol after taste. You really get with you asked for. The staffs were super friendly. I asked a lot of questions and Malcom answered them all with grace. He even helped took a bunch of pictures for me and my boyfriend.

But the biriyani was missing flavor. I've had several biriyanis (or flavored basmati rice) in India and elsewhere and know what is good and bad and this is definitely not good.

After reading the numerous reviews here, we decided to give Crawfish Shack a shot. First, I just want to say THANK YOU! to everyone who has provided such informative reviews.\\nWe picked up a dozen oysters on the half shell (at a very reasonable price imo..11.99) and some shrimp diablo. Very very good. This one is certainly going to be saved on the GPS.\\nThe oysters were fresh. The only thing I would recommend is ask for extra sauce,lemons and horseradish. The 2 little containers just weren't quite enough for all 12. I second that half of the oysters were some of the largest I've ever seen. They have no problem providing the extras for you.\\nThe shrimp diablo was good and suitably spicy. \\nOur waitress was wonderful.\\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it's cramped. It's just a little place in a strip mall and you probably want to get there early to secure a booth. We arrived at 6:30 and just barely beat the dinner rush and were able to grab one of the few remaining tables in the center of the place. About 10 minutes later it's like the floodgates opened and groups arrived by the half dozen or so.\\n\\nWe will be back, again I can't stress how great the oysters were.

I had a Columbia Valley Cab that was quite good.\\n\\nTheir food menu changes, maybe daily. The one we ordered from was very different from the one I saw right after they opened. There were several vegetarian offerings that may be vegan - next time I'll remember to ask about that. They also offered a pulled pork sandwich, pork sausage skewers, a grilled chicken panini wrap and the above-mentioned sirloin cheese burger. Ronda ordered the wrap and I the burger. Her wrap was pretty tasty, though nothing to knock your socks off. The burger I ordered medium was WELL, WELL done. The patty was so thin that it would have been difficult to cook as I ordered it, but no such attempt was made and it was a dry, dark brown thing. It was a two star burger at most. I've had better at McMenamins T&P (a block away) and they are not exactly burger experts. In a burger town like this one, that attempt just ain't gonna fly. They better figure that out. It came with potato salad that was really good - so much so that we ordered a side of it.\\n\\nThere are plenty of pluses at Nook. No doubt I'll be returning and trying their other offerings and I wouldn't want this review to dissuade would-be patrons from trying it out.

Everyone does it, nothing to be ashamed of. When you're in your home town, would you go to a $40-50 buffet for mediocre food? But on vacation? You bet you would. \\n\\nSo why did you come here? The prime rib, lobsters, crab legs, oysters, random seafood stuff? After all the reviews, I just wanted crab legs and people spoke highly of them. So I was like why not? \\n\\nDisappointed is the word I would use. Crab legs were just a big disappointment.  Lobsters aren't all that large but I would rather prefer that though to huge ones since they tend to be more rubber-y than they already are. The lobsters I would rate more a 3.5, better than the crab legs for sure. \\n\\nOysters had bits of shells in them so please be careful. That's no joke to play with. And the clams, even though they're in liquid, you can definitely taste sand and plenty of other stuff in it still. \\n\\nBut 1 thing I did like there was the clam chowder. So that's a plus. Try that and see if you agree with me.  \\n\\nIf you're a dessert person, this would be a let down. Walk through the door way past the dessert \\"bar\\" and the restrooms and you'll be in the back room of the restaurant and you'll see the ice cream \\"bar\\" to your right. Be amazed at those scoops, those are some hella big ass scoopers. \\n\\nOverall, Just do it. No other lobster buffet will have a higher rating and they're all about the same.

At the end of the meal, I didn't even finish the sashimi or the maki roll, I was actually grossed out. Walking into the restaurant, it was 80 degree, this was a bad sign esp for raw fish environment, and as I expected I was eating warm sashimi when they were served. First, the miso soup, it was sweet. Why? MSG. The sashimi combo came out, most of it is warm, the salmon was half frozen. The hamachi was so gross. They tasted supermarket grade at best. The rice was completely dry. I also ordered the Volcano roll, it came out soaked in mayo and oil. There was a sloppy drawing of a heart with siracha all around the plate. Haha, why? Siracha with sushi? Horrible. It was like stir fried seafood then added a lot of mayo then dump all that over the maki roll. After this experience, I don't trust the quality or where they're sourcing their fish.

The jalapeno slices were appropriately freak show gargantuan.\\n\\nThe pho is very good, with a dense broth and plenty of noodles and rare beef. The meatballs had good flavor but texturally felt like they were made from congealed paste rather than actual meat. Overall a good presentation and truly of hearty proportions. A couple spoonfuls of the hot sauce and a quarter lime rounded out the broth quite well. I must have downed a Slurpie's worth of the stuff.\\n\\nAfter the meal, I have to admit...I started to feel a bit lightheaded, pretty tired, and man was I thirsty. I know those side effects.

So I emailed Cory the owner and alerted him that we were treated horribly on this exact same night that another yelp review was published bringing attention to the same employee (madison) once again on the 26th of February. First off Madison was insanely rude to us, we chalked  it up to her having a rough night and let it slide. We then sat for an hour and received no food and after Madison was done screaming at patrons to get out, we alerted her we had not received our food that we paid for. She then proceeded to basically berate us for not going and getting our own food from the front area(after we were told itd be dropped off, why else would we have a number?) We then were also basically told too bad and that we needed to be more patient....though we had waited for 45 minutes and the restaurant was closing. Madison then all but threw us out and after alerting us there's nothing she can do and gave us money back, Now what I find interesting as an industry worker is her response to the other woman who commented. She was  incredibly defensive just like she was that night towards my party.  She even went as far as to insinuated that the other woman wrote an \\"unfair and rude\\" review. I can assure you Madison is nothing less than rude. I can tell you right now she behaves this way because of how Cory the manager/owner behaved towards me when I personally emailed him today. His response to me was: quoted directly from his email to me \\" I haven't seen even the slightest hint of a crack of frustration or rudeness or negative attitude in any way shape or form to any customer. I've only ever witnessed the complete opposite from her and I can't believe that she's just acting on her best behavior because I'm present.\\"  (even though he and madison responded to the yelp review on the 26th discussing the exact same issue from a totally different party) This party even mentions my group after watching madison treat us unfairly. Which Cory was fully aware of when he brushed off my emails to him today. So basically the owner of this establishment lied to my face or as he so eloquently put it \\" There's a version from you on behalf of you and your friends and there's a slightly different version from my employee who I do trust with my business and who I believe in as an employee and a person.\\"  Once again this is two days after the initial complaint of her attitude and (lack of) customer service  2 days prior. He knew the story because multiple people from different parties made him aware of it.\\n  I mean Madison got on yelp and called the woman rude and unfair for being treated badly and calling Madison out on it. Madison even admitted to it then went on to tell the yelp poster she was unfair and rude for saying so. The owner of this business is a flat out liar and the classless responses from both him and his employee are beyond pathetic. I assure anyone you are better off going to a pizza hut because at least they respond properly to their employees being horrible to people, and dont lie to your face and shrug you off and basically tell you that they cant believe she would act this way...when they are already playing clean up for the same night and incident with another party on yelp. After this experience im going straight to the BBB and the rest of the people in my party will be following up on yelp as well as with the BBB . If anyone is curious to see my back and forth with Cory in our emails Im happy to supply them. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant, employee, and owner. If you want to be mistreated, lied to, and brushed off. Then I highly suggest black bird pizza! Oh and even better I was offered a pizza coupon and received NO APOLOGY from Cory and he then said Madison would like to give on e when I came in...after seeing her response to another customers complaining of her sub par and completely classless approach I think Id rather pass.\\n \\nStay tuned for the rest of the party involved in this because its clear theyll do anything necessary to weasel their way out of this.

Our waitress kept telling us it was going to be just another 10 minutes or another three minutes. She said she asked the on-duty manager if he wanted to come over and talk to us and, apparently, he did not. He did however bring us our food and said he would take care of the bill.

Let me start by saying that the food is so good we visited 2 days in a roll. My chicken and waffles were the amazing! The chicken is seasoned so well. You get whole wings and they are small just like a like. I can't stand no horse size wings! I also tasted their macaroni and cheese, greens, and waffle fries. I could taste the soul. I wasn't impressed with the waffle fries and wouldn't order those again but what they are known for is their chicken and waffles and rightfully so.\\nThe environment is clean and  family friendly. My children loved the chicken. They have both booth seating and tables. They also have a bar. This is a traditional restaurant. You order your meal at the table. Our food came out rather quickly and was fresh which was impressive.\\nThey are located inside a strip complex so the parking is plentiful.\\nOutside of the food, what stood out to me was the customer service. One of the staff members, who wasn't even our waiter came over to our table to check on us and held a nice conversation with my husband and son. They talked sports and Star Wars and he even walked us out of the door upon leaving and talked to us some more, making recommendations for us to see while in town. I also witnessed him doing the same to other patrons so it really made you feel at home.\\nWe did have a discrepancy on our bill both days because they were in the process of switching out their menus but on both days our bill was corrected without hesitation.

The steak was on par with the steaks at other renown steakhouses (Plaza III, etc). I wasn't impressed with the potato pave that came along with my steak, but the steak made up for the mediocre side dish. My dad had the filet mignon. He really enjoyed it as well. My mom and sister both had the dry aged ribeye. I don't think they were huge fans, but neither is a real steak lover. The winner at dinner was my wife with her pepper crusted sirloin. The seasoning was perfect and the presentation was beautiful. It looked like art on her plate.\\n\\nFor dessert, definitely try the blueberry ginger sorbet. It's three medium sized scoops of sorbet sitting in a fancy tray of \\"lemon snow.\\" (Yes, there were plenty of Monsters Inc. \\"it's lemon, I promise\\" jokes around the table). The lemon snow is a lemon flavored sour sugar. It's awesome, but don't get too much of it on your spoon. The rest of my party enjoyed the cheesecake well enough, but the sorbet was fantastic and unique.\\n\\nOur server was awesome. She was from Thunder Bay and did a great job of explaining the Canadian themes inside the restaurant. She recommended the poutine, so we tried it. I wasn't a huge fan. I liked the red wine reduction much better on my steak than on the fries. Next time, I'll probably skip the poutine and eat an extra pretzel bread.\\n\\nWe weren't sure if it was wise to use two dining credits here or not, but having done it I'm happy we did and I'd do it again on out next trip to WDW too."},{"name":"Pizzadoro's","address":"33 River St","city":"Dedham","stars":"3.5","text":"This has been our go-to place for pizza takeout for years now.

There are many places for you to choose from when thinking about dim sum.

When you go to dim sum, you really should have an open mind because some of the best savory foods are the ones you might not think are the most savory. For those of you who are new to the dim sum experience, this place will allow you to experience it to the fullest. Dim sum, or \\"touch of the heart\\", is meant to give you a dining experience much like Spanish tapas. You get a small dish of many different foods so that you can taste a little of everything. Some of the classic dim sum plates include: \\nSiu mai (a meat ball kind of)\\nHa Gao (shrimp dumpling)\\nFung zao (braised chicken feet literally translated as \\"Phoenix claws\\")\\nCherng fun (how would you translate this into something that people would understand... rice cake?)\\nPai Guot (braised short ribs)\\nNai wong bao (dessert: egg yolk bao... delicious!!!)\\n\\nThose are a list of my favorite go to dim sum dishes and in generally a pretty safe list of foods that everyone will enjoy. One thing that I have seen served here that I haven't seen elsewhere is the chicken feet, short rib rice. If you like those two dishes then you've got to try this! Make sure to get the soy sauce to go over it and you'll be happily full after finishing your meal =)\\n\\nParking is always a problem in Boston in general and in Chinatown especially.

Everything was just okay as far as taste goes. The ribs and the sausage had a sweet taste to them and the brisket was a little tough.  The potato salad was decent.  The collard greens were good. The coconut cream pie, \\"an excellent choice\\" as stated by the server, sucked.  The crust was way too thick and had hardly any filling in it; the whipped cream had no taste. And the only remnants of coconut were big toasted chunks sprinkled on top of the whipped cream--and they were more crispy than flavorful. \\nMs.: Not impressed with the food.  Everything was much too pricey for me.  The 3 meat plate was $19 which would have been fine if it had been enough food for the two of us to share--it almost always is at other places.  It had one small rib and one link of sausage and thee little slices of brisket. The only sausage they carry is a jalapeno sausage.  The brisket was delightful near the fatty bark but there wasn't much of it.  The rest was dry and uninspiring. I opted not to get a dessert as they were $10 a piece.  The BBQ sauce wasn't bad, although a little on the vinegar side.  For me, the winner at this meal was, sadly enough, the potato salad.  I really did enjoy that.  Very small soft potato portions in a refreshingly cool and mild mayonnaise with crunchy  bits of onion--had a surprising resemblance and texture to that of large curd cottage cheese.  Now, the place itself was gorgeous.  Classy, country chic, upscale retro comfort.

The meat was flavorful and seared crispy on one side like I prefer my schwarma meat (as Tony Stark calls it). \\n\\nIf people are joining me for Greek food in the near future, we will be heading further South past downtown Orlando to my favorite mom and pop joint that my friend, Jenny, introduced me to years ago. \\n\\nI'm not one who believes in harming a business that's trying unless they've got a pest infestation so you'll have to message me if you want to know the name of my Greek restaurant of choice.

Not to dump on The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium in particular, but I'm really frustrated by restaurants that take a dish that would be naturally gluten free, and add something with gluten.

I love Tater Tots so I knew that this was going to be great. Tater Tots on a sizzling skillet with pulled pork and cheese - it tasted exactly as it sounded.  It was like a wonderful poutine.

The second as well. By the third, the heat was getting me sweating and tearing despite copious amounts of ranch-soaked bread. The fourth leg was lost to the heat.\\n\\nThe chicken itself was great. Crisp crust, moist meat. They don't ruin the crust by soaking it in hot sauce like numerous wing joints do. This make their chicken less messy, too.\\n\\nThe mac n cheese was solid. I do not care for their cole slaw, except it was the second most effective tool to manage the heat of the Holy chicken. Again, don't know what methods they use to impart heat, but the sugar and acid of the slaw are effective at combatting it.\\n\\nThe best tool to fight the heat, and a tasty part of the meal, is the banana pudding. Besides being great banana pudding, it really helped cool the conflagration raging in my mouth.\\n\\nNote: there are no banana slices in the pudding -- something I particularly like, but I recognize that many will think them required.\\n\\nThere's a reason HCT still has long lines more than a year after opening in the North Market, a venue with plenty of great restaurants to choose from: they deserve it.

Yet, the students really weren't the problem for me since I accepted that it would be loud and it was until midnight each night.

This resulted in waits typically 15 minutes for an elevator to get to leave the 23rd floor and on each ride the elevator was packed and stopped on each perhaps 10 floors and half the time there was no one there waiting to get on.   There were fliers in the hotel bragging about their new \\"efficient\\" elevator system.  It was certainly efficient for the hotel to give the non-frequent guests and high schools students access to 2 elevators, the valued guests in few floors 27+ better access (at least 3 elevators for 1/3 number of floors) and perhaps 4 elevators staying out of commission.   On checkout I decided to just leave and not go down to breakfast since the lines for everything were really long and it would be at least an hour and to just get a cup of coffee and wait for elevator back and forth.

Boy, am I glad I listened! These cannolis have just made me a fan of the pastry.\\n\\nThe line at 3:30 was already ridiculous, going out the door despite the numerous people inside taking orders and ringing up customers. We patiently waited in line, which moved quite fast, and ended up ordering a ton of pastries. There is also gelato available and a small seating area that the locals seemed to enjoy drinking their coffee, eating their cannoli, and watching the tourist animal zoo in front of them. A string of cannoli pictures are lined up on the wall and the actual pastries are in the glass cases at the front along with shelves of cookies sitting enticingly in the back. We bought the hazelnut, chocolate-covered, and amaretto cannoli. We also got the lobster tail and the ricotta pie.\\n\\nThe cannolis were so delicious! The flaky shell on the outside was obviously not store-bought and the ricotta filling was sweetened just enough to be dessert-like without losing its ricotta flavor. The cannoli was bursting with filling and huge in and of itself. Size of a flashlight handle would be an appropriate comparison? Of the three cannolis, my favorite was the chocolate-covered one. The chocolate helped keep the crunchiness and just added an extra flavor on top of the delicious cannolis. However, the hazelnut and amaretto were good too, though I couldn't really taste the flavoring very much. The hazelnut surprised me with coconut in it and that was fun.\\n\\nNext, the lobster tail. The lobster tail was HUGE! It took up almost half the box. Though quite famous, it was not my favorite. I liked the croissant-like, buttery tail part of this lobster tail. However, the almost whipped cream filling was not to my taste.\\n\\nFinally, the ricotta pie. The slice was big, being about the size of two anemic slices of pie. The ricotta middle layer was similar to the barely sweetened ricotta filling of a cannoli. However, the top and crust parts were much sweeter, perhaps with honey? I liked it very much and I wish I hadn't stuffed myself so full of cannolis before working on the pie.\\n\\nI definitely recommend going to Mike's Pastry.

My friend and I simply hopped over the fence of Tiny's outdoor deck and under the canopy of the El Brasero cart to check out the menu.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind: I am not what you'd call an \\"adventurous\\" eater- in fact, I'm really picky, especially when it comes to condiments.  I'm not a fan of huge juicy, messy burritos, and I despise sour cream.  I like to taste the solid ingredients inside of my tortilla- not have them swimming in a sludge of melted cheese and other creams.\\n\\nSo, I ordered the tacos.  Simple.  Only $1.50 each, and plenty of meats to choose from.  Soft shell, perfect amount of meat (I've tried the beef and pork- both excellent), garnished with onions and cilantro, with a small slice of radish and lime on the side.  And salsas upon request, of course!\\n\\nTHEY WERE AMAZING!  EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!  AND ONLY $1.50 A POP!  Last time I was feeling ravenous and ordered four, but I could only finish three.\\n\\nObviously, your taste preferences may vary.

But when something is so often hyped, especially in the age of social media and constant advertisement, very few times does something line up with the hyperbole of its word of mouth promotion. \\n\\nI've been subscribed to HCT emails for well over a year now, my wife has been there several times tempting me with hushed whispers of vinegar-y cole slaw and diabetic coma inducing sweet tea. Everyone is shocked I haven't been yet to the point its like I just told them I'd never seen Empire Strikes Back. Today, I got to see for myself what it was all about. Friends, I've seen the light. \\n\\nI channel a strong mental image when somebody says Mac n' Cheese, and somehow HCT can read my brainwaves. The mac n cheese is equal parts goopiness, cheese and pasta, a golden ratio in my opinion. The cole slaw has a crisp, fresh-from-grammas-fridge crunch to it, and the vinegar has a tart but sweet bite to it. The bread is bread, but thats not a bad thing. The sweet tea again tastes like somebody's ancestors have been passing down the recipe for years. Its so sweet I may need to ring up my dentist tomorrow.\\n\\nThe chicken gets its own paragraph. I went for the Hot drumsticks. The skin itself has this crispy texture but isn't overly dry or too oily, nor does it completely rip off the drum at the first bite leaving you with just chicken. Not that I'd mind because the chicken underneath had just the right amount of flavor and moistness to it. I need to pause here and discuss the seasoning with you... I know there is definitely Cayenne, garlic, chili powder, but it doesn't matter whats in it, the point is its spicy, but people do spicy all the time. This spicy still had flavor, and the flavor really amplified the chicken. I was impressed because everybody does spicy and its always a race to who can cause you the pain and embarrassment of a red face and a sore tongue. I really can't wait to go back and try other combinations of chicken cuts and spice levels.\\n\\nI like the way the interior is set up, the cashiers were very pleasant.

Perfectly poached, eggcelent eggs lay on top of harmonious ham slices stacked on English muffin mountains lathered in hallucinogenic hollandaise. Your life is never the same after that first bite.

Literally the best canoli I have ever had. Once they know your order, they prepare it fresh to your liking, not like most bakeries where the canoli is already sitting out for a period of time.

Go here for great deals and great booze, but eat elsewhere, unless you're down to get the house special burger.\\n\\nWhile their beer list isn't huge, it's well-curated, with a diverse array of good local microbrews on draft for $4 (cider for $5). I'd definitely recommend the Fearless Porter they had, which was caramel-y and dark, but not overpowering, and light enough for session drinking. They've also got a PBR tap, if that's your thing. \\n\\nHoping to beat the heat later on into the evening, I ordered a cheap Jamaican rum and tonic with a large wedge of lime. The bartender set the ratio just right, making it stiff, but still refreshing and summery. For $5, it wasn't at all a bad deal, especially considering the drink's strength. \\n\\nStar Bar's Happy Hour rocks! Microbrews are $3 per pint, cider is $4, and PBR is $1.50. Well drinks are $3 each. It lasts from 4:00 to 8:00, giving you plenty of time to drink for cheap. Just in case you needed additional deals, look for the A-frame sign in the bar that features the daily drink specials. You'll be impressed.\\n\\nThe food varies. The fries are serviceable. My coworkers' totchos were hot, but needed more cheese on them, making them effectively tater tots with a few jalape√±os and a smattering of cheese, salsa, and sour cream. The happy hour burger I ordered was pretty lame. Overcooked and lacking in flavor, I barely tasted the meat, cheese, or garlic spread. It mostly just tasted like char and bun, and it shared the totchos' cheese deficiency. That said, the house burger I had most recently was delicious! While it's got a lot of ingredients (lettuce, tomato, bacon, garlic spread, bleu cheese, caramelized onions, and crispy shallots), they work together really well. When I had it, despite the Burger Week rush, it was plenty juicy and brimming with flavor. Even the lettuce and tomato, which I normally think should be banished from most sandwiches, served an effective purpose, taming the more strongly-flavored ingredients somewhat.\\n\\nI like how Star Bar is laid out. It's got booths, coffee tables and stools, picnic tables, and and varying areas of light and dark. Likewise, the art is great, and perfectly fitting for a Portland rock bar--pinups, rock stars, and a picture of .44 magnum laid across a TV dinner, emblazoned with a warning to DJs not to play Warren Zevon to excess. As you would expect, the background music is great. Mostly Otis Redding and The Dirtbombs, with the occasional Judas Priest when I was there, but I suspect that it's great all the time, given who's depicted in the bar's paintings.\\n\\nStar Bar pours good drinks at low prices and has one of the best atmospheres I've experienced in Portland. Is it fancy, gimmicky, or gourmet? No. Is it fun? Absolutely!"},{"name":"The Greek Corner","address":"1600 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is an adorable little Greek place with outside seating overlooking Lake Ivanhoe.

We showed up at prime dining hour on a Saturday and were told that we would have to wait for 1 hour and 20 minutes but that we could have drinks at the bar. So we shimmied up to the bar and a different person told us we couldn't stand at the bar--that it was a seating place for dinner already promised to another group. A minute later we were told we could actually choose to have dinner at the very same seated area at the bar. Very confusing but we ended up not having to wait and happily took the bar seating.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed is that this place is super loud. I enjoy a lively space and the buzz of a good eating spot, but I really dislike having to scream to carry on a conversation. Prepare to leave with a hoarse voice.\\n\\nI think Blue Dragon is trying to emulate the Myers and Chang format but isn't pulling it off quite as well. Our group of four ordered 3 plates each. Two of us were vegetarians so we ordered mostly veg options. (Or we thought.)\\n\\nThe thing with small plates is normally there's enough that everyone can, at the very least, sample a tasting of each dish. Not here--the dishes are extremely small. For example, the deviled egg is the equivalent to that of exactly one egg. Also, it's good to ask the server about the dishes you order since the menu descriptions are limited. One of us ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and the dish was unexpectedly prepared with ground pork.\\n\\nHaving said that, the food is good. The lobster shumai was delicious as was the vegetable Chow Fun.

They came out swimming in sauce which is not my favorite style, but it is a good sauce, slightly sweet and flavorful.  The ribs themselves were very meaty, and tasted great on their own.  A good crust, flavor in the meat, good texture.  I also had coleslaw (pretty ordinary) and baked beans.  The beans were really good, thick, sweet and tangy with an unusual flavor we couldn't pin down.  5 spice?  I don't know.  I sampled the greens and they were excellent, and Bryant said the potato salad was really good too.\\n\\nThey were very accommodating and brought the food to the car, along with napkins and wet-naps.  Drinks are cans and bottles.  They have desserts which all sounded good, but our meals were plenty.

Both times, our servers were friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. On the first visit I tried the potato wedges with tzaziki substituted for the creamy bacon ranch sauce. The wedges were tasty, but I would have preferred them to be cut a bit smaller to maximize the flavour.  The second time I tried the salmon chowder, which was excellent. It contained large (but not too large) pieces of salmon and potato, and the broth was infused with tomato and not too thick or heavy. I also thought it was quite a large bowl of soup for the price ($7). One final comment: our server the day we were there as a big group handled multiple bills like an expert and seemed completely unfazed by dozens of credit cards being thrown at her by a bunch of people who were in a rush to get to another event.

Still seating happened fairly quicker than we were used to.\\n\\nWe've done this plenty of times so I knew exactly how much I wanted to order. 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of snow crab, 1 appetizer Calamari, and chicken strips for the kid. This is usually our standard order for 2 people and 1 kid.\\n\\nThe food: The food was alright. It wasn't bad, but i've had better. The crab was a bit salty. My other half (who is pregnant) found the saltiness unbearable. The Shrimp was too mild (even though we ordered it medium spicy) but my other half loved it.\\n\\nThe cons: So I imagine they were busier than they were used to and they made several mistakes during our meal. For example they brought us crawfish instead of shrimp. When we pointed it out they immediately took it back to correct the issue. And the chicken strips we ordered for the kid came out a little raw. They corrected the chicken when we pointed it out, but the shrimp they brought out wasn't the medium spicy we had originally requested. Nonetheless we were okay with it, because if the crab was any indication it might have come out too salty for our taste.\\n\\nOverall: I thought the food was fairly priced. Despite the few hiccups in service, all were promptly corrected, and the food was not bad. So why do they get a 4 star instead of 3? Well 2 reasons actually: 1. Despite a couple of kitchen mistakes service was pretty good 2. Crab and Shrimp boil is a comfort food in our family, and It's awesome that one has opened up so close to home.\\n\\nDefinitely would recommend this place, and I imagine this will be a place we visit every couple months or so."},{"name":"Maya Indian Bar and Grill","address":"33 Tuttle St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't believe I didn't find this gem in the north shore sooner!

Now, the dinner was TERRIBLE. The broiled seafood platter was the most bland seafood that I've ever had. It literally taste like they boiled it, pulled it out of the water and put it on the plate just like that. My aunt (who was celebrating her 30 year wedding anniversary) had the lobster tail and filet Mignon. I do wish that I would have had less class (you know; no phones at the table)  and took a picture of the food at the table so that I could show you how this steak looked. I'll put it to you like this: she ordered filet mignon and got sirloin. The meat tasted like something I would feed my dog. Absolutely ZERO flavor and definitely was not even close to being filet mignon. The lobster tail appeared to be sitting on top the shell, uncooked. I was afraid to even try it because of how raw it appeared to be. She had no choice but to sent her plate back. All of the sides that they brought out were cold, as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp, waiting for someone to bring them out. Last but not least, my cousin and I decided we'd share the lobster Mac n cheese. Boy were we in for a treat... NOT! This Mac n cheese was literally something that my 7 year old son could have made without lessons from me. The elbow noodles were dry. There was barely any cheese in the Mac, and the \\"lobster\\" was sitting on top of the Mac. As if it were a garnish. This lobster mac cost a whopping $25. Sooooo not worth it! The server was able to give us 2 free desserts for our trouble and I thought, \\"wow! What a nice gesture\\" . WRONG AGAIN! The dessert was TERRIBLE .

I went for comedy night  on 8/8. We arrived early to grab a bite to eat not knowing food is not sold after 3pm. We were offered a pizza instead.

My friend had the pre made sandwich and  was trying to eat it but ended throwing it away because she said it was horrible. After she comes back to the table the guy at the table next to us takes a bite out of his sandwich and says its the worst sandwich he has ever had. \\nYour food options for night events needs to be expanded more so because people are drinking.

It says a lot to be able to get crawfish year round to maintain the integrity behind that name, but they do - from Cali when it's not in season here. \\n\\nSo, I was easily talked into getting the 2lbs of crawfish here since you get the lovely add ons of sausage, a potato, corn, and mushrooms.

Though I was tempted to say yes, I was wearing my \\"you're going to make a big mess\\" eating hoodie. \\n\\nThe crawfish is...crawfish, I could only really gauge it by price since a lot of crawfish is boiled with similar seasoning. As long as it isn't boiled dead, it's good to me. It's crawfish season, so the price is reasonable, about 6.95/lb. And they give you a mess bucket :). Oh, and get your crawfish spicy, if you can take pickled jalapenos, you can take the spicy.

It's an uber simple concept: Beer + Patio +Grill + Sun = Utter Contentedness. The fact that this place consistently happens to provide the best beer in town (can you say Copacetic??) brings it up a couple of notches. They re-did their patio in the last year to add a ton more seating and neat little bar where you can stand and chat. It's often way crowded, especially on those magical Portland days where the sun comes out for the first time in a long while, but the patrons there are so sweet (or super friendly drunk) and they are usually willing to scoot over and offer you half a picnic table. The crowd that the place attracts consists of surprisingly diverse social groups and nearly always provides some sort of entertainment, even if only in quality people watching action. I always tell myself that I'm not going to eat there, that I want something fancier and yet I nearly always end up pigging out there anyways. Something about downing a few beers with the smells of a grill constantly drifting past my nose ALWAYS manages to change my mind. And it's a quality sausage sandwich, for sure. Smothered in kraut with a six pack of mustards to choose from. Not too shabby, but certainly not fancy. Oh! And there's a dog! That sits in a lawn chair!

We made a reservation for 7.30pm but arrived 10 mins ahead of time. It wasn't an issue and got seated by the friendly hostess shortly. The place was busy but a server came by to serve some bread quickly, which I appreciated. It was nice and warm, so far so good. But unfortunately, that's also when the positives ended. It was almost 30 mins later before someone came to get our drink and food orders. After another 20mins, the server who took our orders came by to apologize for the delay and said he would be back to get our order. We reminded him that he already took our order and he looked surprised, which made me wonder if the order made it to the kitchen. Anyway, it was over an hour from when we first got seated, before we got our food. We had planned to order appetizers, salads, entrees and dessert but since it took over 30 mins to order something, we decided we would only get entrees. Poor service aside, we were very disappointed in the food. I had a spaghetti carbonara dish, while my husband ordered a seafood penne dish. My spaghetti turned out to be linguini, which frankly, isn't a big deal, but it tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for a long time, because the ends of the pasta were hard.The pasta was also drowning in a lot of sauce, which unfortunately was also pretty bland. The penne dish wasn't much better, and even copious amounts of pepper could not rescue it from the lack of flavor. We ate as much as we could, and got the hell out of there. \\n\\nWe've actually been here before a few times before, a few years back, and we were glad it was still in business since in general, we enjoy patronizing local businesses. The last time we were here, we thought the food was not that good, given the high prices but since that was a few years ago, we figured we would give it another chance. It looks like it'll be another few years before we would venture back here, given our experience.

The second were a somewhat underwhelming wild boar rib dish.  The meat was a bit tough, and not quite as gamey as I would have expected.  The mix of the blue cheese and the sambal paste balanced nicely.  \\n\\nFor an entree, I went with the brisket - it was pretty disappointing as a start (although I say this in retrospect after the rest of my trip).  The coffee rub had a good flavor, but the crust didn't have enough bark to it, and the meat itself was very dried out.

Manjeet was friggin' awesome. I started going here regularly when I moved to Union Square in the past future year of 2000. He was extremely outgoing. I was goofy enough/worthy to merit a bop on the head with the menu. I used to draw pictures for/of him on the comment cards we'd get at the end of the meal, and one day he blew me away by showing me that he'd kept every. Single. One. Ever. That included drawings I made for him and slipped to the delivery driver when we'd get takeout. Oh, Manjeet. ;_; I heard he bought a gas station in Pennsylvania. Godspeed, Manjeet! He told me he'd marry me if my husband-who-used-to-be-my-boyfriend didn't cowboy up. SIGH...\\n\\nAnyhow, the only thing that makes this place worth coming to, aside from Manjeet, is the food. HA! Okay, that's a joke that didn't work, even to me, and I made it. The atmosphere is... tiny place. They used to have a kind of ghastly decorating scheme with sequinned art (I shit you not, sequinned art. My grandma, rest her soul, used to have the same sort of artwork. Did I mention she liked drinking a lot?). My dad assures me that the kitchen is super-clean (I could tell you how my dad knows this, but he'd probably yell at me for telling you how he'd know that a restaurant's kitchen is clean, which is to say that obviously he is in a position to know this, so just trust me when I tell you that they don't have a filthy kitchen). This is important because there are some restaurants around Somerville that are so effing filthy that you'd be devastated to learn how such wonderful food could come from such vile conditions. Anyhow, moving on...\\n\\nOne of my standards for sizing up a restaurant that serves food from a region that does not have a lot of indigenous white people (like India) in an area where there is a very diverse ethnic population (like Somerville) is how many people eating there are not white. I have to say that the more white people I see in a restaurant, the warier I become. White people are capable of some pretty terrible choices in determining what makes \\"good food.\\" That's why places like TGI Friday's and the Texas Chainsaw Roadhouse are allowed not only to exist, but succeed. I say this as a white person. It's okay, we all know. Don't worry. White people are pretty horrible. You know, this isn't even a trait that's exclusive to white people. Before I incite a race riot, I'm going to stop here.\\n\\nThat said, there are not a lot of Indian people ever eating in here when I'm there. In fact, I'd have to say it's extremely rare. I've been to a few Indian restaurants around, and this is my favorite (my boss, an Indian guy, tells me the place to go is the Bombay Club, and make no mistake, that is a great place). I was told by a first-generation-American friend whose parents were very traditional Indian that they're a lot heavier with the cream hand than a lot of places are. Maybe that's the appeal? She liked the food, so that made me feel better that I wasn't eating in a place that was all whited-up for whitey. My guess is that it's not as convenient a location as the places in Central or Harvard Squares. The food is wonderful. They make the hands-down best saag paneer ever. EVER. I've yet to have a bad vegetarian dish here. We love the navratan korma and the malai kofta in particular. Ever want to eat a delicious grain sausage in wonderful, savory sauce? You do? Get the malai kofta. I'm looking at their vegetarian menu in another window and I can honestly say that I've tried everything on it over the years and that I've never been disappointed by any of it. I didn't think that I liked lamb for a long time, but India Palace got me liking lamb. I won't go out of my way for it, but I like it more than I did ten years ago when I thought it was awful (the only time I'd had it was when my grandma made it, the aforementioned drinkin' grandma with the sequin art). They do make some fantastic chicken tikka masala, which is  marvelous way to introduce someone to Indian food, especially if they're scared of everything that isn't a chicken cutlet sub dressed only with cheese and mayonnaise (I have known these people. You probably do, too). Flavorful, rich, indulgent, sweet, savory, all at once! Taste adventure!\\n\\nAnyhow, they have a fun, diverse lunch buffet.

The Lime Garage allows you access to the closest point to the large World of Disney store, lego store and T-Rex. The other garage (Orange?) is closer to the theater, bowling alley and old Disney West.

Sometimes there are tents and there is always \\"jumping\\" water for the kids by the Disney Toy store.

Sorry you can't force customers to tip, especially before any type of service is provided.  The app said my food would be ready at 9pm.  So we enter the restaurant at about 8:58.

No one asks my name or if we are being helped or if we needed anything.  Third: I waited at the counter for a half hour.  At 9:24 the girl behind the counter asked our name and handed us a bag that had been sitting on the counter the ENTIRE time we were waiting.  Our food had been sitting there on the counter for 30+ minutes and the 4 girls working there couldn't take 1 minute to ask our name and hand me the bag.  I was also forced to tip $1.50 for this 30 minute wait. I crossed out the tip and put the total and signed the receipt so I hope I don't get incorrectly charged.

Since the opening of Greenbeat, I bought approximately 10 salads from them and I have had 3 bad experiences with them. First, I found a hair in my salad. Second, I had a broken pebble/rock in my spring mix/kale. I asked to remake the salad and it was remade with the wrong ingredients. At that point I was frustrated and wanted a refund. The manager/staff showed no remorse for their failure to take proper care when preparing my salad in both situations. Today, I returned to Greenbeat and in my opinion the young lady working the register was completely rude. After a hair and a rock was found in my salads, I chose to return.

Appetizers are actually usually pretty great (fried pickles deserve another mention). Service is always stellar, even at peak business, so points for that. But, I always just feel underwhelmed by the whole experience.\\n\\nThe one thing that remains top class is its beer menu. This is *perfect*. Literally the best I've ever seen. Long enough that you have a choice, but short enough that you're overwhelmed. Comfort drafts that stay the same, so you know they're solid, but a regularly rotating list of let's-try-something-new beers.

Impressive given how much it changes.\\n\\nI wish Cambridge Common were more bar and less restaurant. I'd come for drinks more often. But as is, you can't get a table without ordering food (except for maybe late at night?), and with the food consistently coming in below expectations (which is partly because expectations had been high, not because food is necessarily bad, or even less than above-average), that's unfortunate.

Originally I heard of promise pizza from someone I met at sweet ritual who also had Celiac's disease. She told me about how they are certified gluten-free and she's never had a problem there. The first time I went I was impressed with the crust and the dayia cheese (only the best kind of vegan cheese) they had there. This time, after Chewie working at a pizza shop, we definitely knew what we liked on pizza and I just got my first paycheck and had been craving pizza for weeks so we loaded it up with all the toppings!! The chef asked us for the size of gluten-free pizza we wanted, I was confused, I'd never been asked that before. I was like is there more then one size of gluten-free pizza? And he said that he just special made some 16\\" gluten-free crusts!! I was so excited!!! I've never had a vegan gluten-free pizza that big!! And as we are eating the perfect (even with all the toppings, it staied together and didn't fall over when you picked it up, AMAZING), delicious pizza, I asked about the accent the chef had, apparently, he's actually from Itally, and then he got to talking about his adventures, he's a traveler, he's been skydiving, he's been bungie jumping, this guy is a blast!

If you're gonna give such small portions for the banchan, you know we're gonna ask for more, right? She did everything robotically, not in a rude way, just like it was a kind of work-camp chore in a long line of endless work-camp chores.

I had high hopes for this dish, friends. I wanted an omelette that would be bursting with the strong flavors of the apple and the cheddar -- a delightful taste of Vermont in the fall if you will. Alas, my hopes just weren't realized. The apples appeared to be sliced where I assumed they would be diced into tinier pieces to encourage even distribution so some bites were completely apple heavy and others lacked any apples at all. The omelette also came with homefries (fine, nothing special), one strawberry (yes, one), two slices of honeydew melon with the rind on (details, people!), and unbuttered toast. Perhaps it's personal preference, but by the time my food was delivered, there was no way the butter I put on my toast was going to melt.

After the usual brunch wait, we were very excited about getting some coffee, which turned out to be very watery. I expected this to be the only let-down, but it was really the beginning of a terrible meal.\\n\\nIt was warm out, so I decided to order lemonade. I am from the South, so I may be a bit biased, but when I order lemonade, I expect actual lemonade. What I got was a generic version of crystal light lemon. On top of that disappointment, there was way too much mix and I could only taste the fake sugar. It hurt my teeth to drink and I only took two sips before giving up. \\n\\nAt this point, I began to get nervous, so I ordered a basic turkey, spinach, onion, mushroom, and potato hash off of the specials menu. Note: the Specials Menu. The potatoes were on the side and had absolutely no seasoning. The rest of the hash was truly an overcooked, watery omelet. It was also way too salty. I ate it out of hunger, but did not enjoy it. I am an average cook. I honestly feel that I could not only reproduce my meal, I could make it taste and look much better.\\n\\nThe fruit garnish and side of toast was the best part of my experience at Zaftigs. I get the sense from others' reviews that they do some things very well, but others are underwhelming. I got all of the underwhelming today.\\n\\nMy fiance forced down 3 cups of coffee and ordered the challah french toast and added strawberries. The slices of bread were thick and he said they tasted ok, but they were topped with four small pieces of strawberry. He was annoyed that he paid a dollar more for just a couple pieces of fruit.

They are also pretty costly, so it's very easy to run up a huge tab if you can't resist buying everything that looks yummy here (which is me).\\n\\nBottom Line: The chaos might discourage some, but don't let that fool you. It's definitely worth a trip and a try! The cannolis are huge, very tasty and make for great snacks, but don't come here on a full stomach because they are way bigger than they look!"},{"name":"Mad Hatter","address":"969 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"Glad we found this place!

The place is located in a strip mall and we we got inside, it was a little disappointing. The place is old and not smelled and looked relly clean and the furnitures are so worn out. Anyway, we were seated right away and gave our orders to our server.  We told him that none of us have ever tried crawfish and he offered to demonstrate to us how to open them. We got our orders and they were mouth watering! We ordered shrimps with corn and sausages,snowcrab legs, crawfish, and a couple of sides. The sides were ok, my side of rice was old and overcooked, but the seafoods.... They were all magnificent! Their mild and medium sauces are just very delicious! The corn cobs, soaking in the buttered medium spiced sauce, are simply irresistable! Our server did mess up one of our orders, the service was good enough. Their drinks are not refillable, except for iced teas and water. The one big set back for us was that their airconditioning system wasn't working, and it's 90 degrees outside! We were sweating like crazy while eating the spicy seafoods so it was uncomfortable. They could use a little cleaning in the bathrooms and the place overall and maybe upgrade their furnitures?

It is located on congress street, about 2 miles at most form the capitol and 1/2 mile from the eating district to the north and 1/2 mile to the soco district to the south.  \\n\\nThe hotel is relatively modern, has beautiful decor, and ambiance, and a giant center atrium with all rooms halls opened to the atrium.  So it really feels lovely but for some it might feel cheesy.  The view here is likely the best view you can get in Austin.  You are across the colorado river from the city, so you can see the city lights from the pool and the balconies and one side of the hotel.  That site and feel along the river is very romantic and high class and tops my list of hotels overall for most city experiences.  \\n\\nThe rooms are average, expected decors and quality, and service meets this 4 star hotel.  The gym is average to small but comparable to other 4 stars.  The pool is great, standard rectangular, and not heated.  It is pretty and not cheesy or lame experience at the pool, but not necessarily top or family oriented.  I would suspect this is a average pool for a 4 star business hotel in a city and the view is great at night from the pool.  \\n\\nParking is free!!!  Wifi free!!!  The restaurants are what's expected, lovely, and priced at 4 star city hotel pricing.  There are 2 places within 1/16 of a mile from the hotel on the other side of the parking lot.  Zak's (restaurant) and Aussie's (volleyball bar-restaurant).  The pricing here is great.  $5 mixed drinks, $3 wines, volleyball at Aussie's; and zak's has very affordable and good food.   \\n\\nWe did like this hotel and would imagine it would be hard for any other 4 star hotel to impress me more than this one has in Austin.   This was our 3rd hotel in Austin in 3 trips.  \\n\\nNOTE:  This hotel is next to congress street bridge, which is famous!  Congress street bridge is home to the largest urban colony of bats in the world.  At sunset, 1.5 million bats begin flying out from under the bridge, and it takes a few hours to finish.  Folks watch from below and on the bridge.  There are bat guano collectors so there is no smell or issue.  The bats are cared for, and safe, friendly enough (as in they don't hunt people down), and they fly away from the hotel at sunset for insects.  The city promotes them for 2 reasons:  1: they eat a lot of bugs.  2: they post no health issues and promote tourism.  We saw about 50 people that day watching them.  They do begin migrating in the fall for Mexico until Apr or so.  Please check with other sites for more info.\\n\\nWARNING:  Because this hotel is an open atrium there are two things to remember.  1st, the elevator is glass walled so you see all the way up and down; cool if you love that, bad if you are afraid of heights.  2nd, because it's an atrium, sound travels to everyone in the entire open atrium on all hallway floors.  If you 2 year old throws a cow fit on the 8th floor, the entire hotel hears it and so forth.  I don't think this is a reason not to stay if you don't have kids, but definitely something to remember if you have very \\"free roaming\\" loud children otherwise."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Modern Pastry has better Gluten Free Options, otherwise Mike's is a great, famous Boston classic.

Their ceviche used to be $8; now it's $11. Don't get me wrong, the quality is as high as ever - a minor mountain of delicious fish in a wonderful lime bath, accompanied with a tasty wedge of sweet potato and some corn. It was my favorite dish at LC and it's still great, it's just that you pay more for it now. My meal of papas a la huancaina ($6), ceviche ($11), and chicha ($3) was a little on the spendy side for the quantity, even if the quality was still high.\\n\\nAt least the menu is much larger - even the ceviche comes with more options now, with a larger version that has other ingredients like octopus in it for $15. They got rid of their tacos, which were decent but not worth writing home about, and added many more items that could tempt me away from the ceviche. I'm not sure what's in a $14 soup, but I will probably try it, and I'm extremely curious what their take on pasta is like.\\n\\nI don't blame Lima Criolla for changing, because a lot has changed for them. Whereas before they were a kiosk in the food court of a dying mall, now they're a full-fledged family restaurant. I went there on their first day for their soft opening and I was glad to see that they were full.

Judging solely on a plain cannoli, I found Mike's filling to be good, but the cannoli shell was much too thick for my liking.

That's a bold statement I know, but it was the first time that both the gravy and biscuit really mixed together so well.  The gravy was rich, delicious, and well balanced.

I called Sunday, left a message and got no return call.  I called Monday and was told to call back the next day at 3 when the woman who does shipping is there, which I did.  She told me that she called me twice and the call went straight to voicemail both times.  To me this is odd as no one else EVER has a problem calling me.  Also,  I feel she should have left me a message.  The first story was they were out of cannoli cream, lies.  Second story, was they were having issues with their computer and could not ship.  Last story, and my favorite--I was told they saw that my order was placed for a birthday and they were not sure if I wanted the cannoli's anymore since the birthday had passed.

It has been reliable and good.

The coffee is good and you can also get espressos, lattes, teas and the like.  The atmosphere has a relaxed bookstore/coffee shop feel to it which is a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the airport.\\n\\nWhat Cafe Intermezzo suffers from is poor execution in the back of the house.  Today was just sloppy and careless food preparation.  I ordered an egg white Intermezzo (veggie) omelette and requested that my server tell the cook to take it easy on the oil/butter they used to cook it in (learned from my last Intermezzo oily omelette experience when I didn't make this request).  First warning sign when it came out: a greasy to the touch plate.  Yes, I touched the underside of the rim of the plate to move it and my fingertips came off laden with oil.  Second warning sign:  the omelette was quite shiny.  Third warning sign and the kicker to send it back:  I took the small bowl of fruit off the plate and underneath it was a pool of oil.  Wow!  If that's taking it easy on the oil used to cook it in then you better pop your cholesterol meds before you walk in!  I had the waitress take it back and after she removed it the table in front of me was covered with the oil from that sloppy mess of a plate.  I had to lay down napkins so I wouldn't get any grease all over myself and the other items on the table.  Yuk!  \\n\\nIt wasn't just me this morning either.  The gentleman next to me sent back his scrambled eggs because they were cold.  The lady next to me ordered a savory crepe that looked greasy and that she was tearing apart to get to the inside...which did not look appetizing and I suspect she ate very little of by the time she left.  \\n\\nSo, I had coffee and a small fruit cup that ended up costing nearly 8 bucks.  For that price, I can go elsewhere in the airport.

When we got to Hanover Street, we decided to try a cannoli from Mike's and one from Modern Pastry just down the street so we could compare them.\\n\\nThe line at Modern Pastry was so long we decided to split up and I braved the much longer Mike's line. I was scared it'd take a long time, but the one line out the door split into three and once you got to the front counter, you could order from any of the many employees scrambling to fill little paper boxes with delish pastries as fast as they could. If you go to the right, you can order gelato, ice cream or marzipans from the counter there before you even reach the front. The marzipans looked absolutely wonderful. Shiny, miniature fruits that looked real and really yummy.\\n\\nThere were many kinds of cannoli to choose from, the tiramisu looked tempting and I wish I had more time to sample the various cookies and cakes they had on display. I was dedicated to my task, however, got my plain cannoli and managed to get out in pretty good time. There are also tables at Mike's where you can eat your pastry and also get coffee drinks. Even with a long line out the door, there were plenty of tables available, but I couldn't tell if there was table service or not.\\n\\nBy comparison, the Mike's cannoli far outshined the Modern Pastry one. Granted, I'd never had cannoli before but I could easily tell which was better - so this isn't about how good Mike's is in the whole wide world of cannoli, but if these are the two best Boston has to offer, Mike's your guy. The Mike's cannoli pastry was thicker, flakier and more buttery and the filling was slightly sweeter and had a lighter texture than the Modern Pastry. That one's pastry was thinner, not flaky at all and the filling was a little more bland and had the texture of cheesecake rather than pastry filling. You might like that better, but I think Mike's is the way to go on the cannoli.

Because of all of these positive reviews I  spent $50. What a waste. I'm no longer Going to trust these 4&5 star reviews for Thai food in Portland and Vancouver. Each and every time we end up regretting and being  dissapointed with the restaurant.\\n\\nThe papaya salad was very small and consisted of a pile of papaya and perhaps 3 cut green beans with a handful of lettuce tossed around it. No spice and it was overly salty. We left it on the plate.\\nThe Tom Kha was a very watered down version.  their was no good coconut milk rich broth like in a good Tom Kha should have.. For veggies in the Tom Kha it was over cooked cabbage, carrots a few tiny broccoli and onions. \\nFrown :(.\\n\\nThey do not include any sticky rice with your papaya salad nor do they  include any rice with your Tom Kha.  \\n\\nThe tofu salad rolls were a piece of tofu and ice burg lettuce wrapped in rice paper. No thank you. Peanut sauce was watered down and had a funny taste to it.\\n\\nWhat a waste. The only thing I liked was the building and the inside of the restaurant small quaint and unassuming. \\nBut I'm not there for the archietechture or the posh tables and fixtures.

The mouth is willing but the stomach is weak.  I can eat a Wendy's \\"spicy\\" chicken or Taco Bell \\"hot\\" sauce with no worries, but a few jalapenos on a sandwich or burger might bring about a little discomfort.  A spicy Thai noodle dish usually means being fairly miserable for the rest of the day or even overnight.  \\n\\nI'm currently in my 27th hour of intestinal distress since eating at HCT.  Worth it?  Totally.  And I didn't even get the \\"holy.\\"  \\n\\nNo really... this is easily the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Juicy and flavorful all the way through, not just the breading, and it's a generous breast/leg serving.  The slaw tastes very fresh, lots of tasty black pepper and not weighed down with a thick dressing.  The mac-n-cheese tasted just like my mom's used to.  And the ranch dressing... mother of god.  So good.  The white bread beneath soaked up all the spicy goodness of the chicken.  Even the pickle slices were high-quality.\\n\\nMy one minor complaint about the food is that the sweet tea was both weak and not nearly sweet enough.  Southern-style sweet tea is a whole 'nother animal than what we call sweet tea up here, so if that's what they're shooting for, they should add another bag of sugar.\\n\\nThe location is easy to find and everyone was really nice.

In addition to my omelet I also sampled the french toast which was quite tasty and fresh - not dry and cold as I have experienced at many a buffet in the past and I also ate my fair shair of fruit and grits.

If you want that endorphin rush, you'll want to order the Hot or Extra Hot, or maybe even Thai Hot.

They're not the French style, sandwich-type ones you might expect; they're soft pillows of almond-y goodness that have a richness that is unexpected in a cookie that light. The almond, pignoli, and plain macaroons all taste similar; the pistachio ones have a different texture but are equally tasty. If you want the best bang for your buck, only get a couple pistachio ones though: they charge by weight, and the others are much lighter :).\\n\\nAs a side note: while I love and wholeheartedly endorse MIke's for all your pastry needs, go across the street to Modern if you're ordering a cake.

In my initial encounter their signature banana French toast was rather underwhelming. I gave their non-breakfast menu another chance a week or so later, admittedly influenced by aforementioned husband, and still was not super impressed. Details of the items are below. Prices were on the high side, $15-25 per person. The level of calorie-induced guilt was also high as most items are loaded with carb and grease. On the bright side our service was consistently prompt and friendly, which brought them up from 2 to 3 star status. With so many other options in the restaurant-packed Coolidge Corner, it will be a hard sale for me to return to Zaftigs the next time we are in the area. \\n\\n- Banana stuffed french toast - $12, side bacon - $3.50; side egg - $2.50\\n       The creamy banana filling was quite delicious on its own, unfortunately it antagonized the fresh, somewhat sour strawberry topping. The dry, chewy textures of the blueberries were out of place with the soft bread. The final fatal blow to this dish was delivered by the sweet syrup as it pretty much overwhelmed all other flavors; no Bourbon or vanilla appreciated. Fortunately a side of crispy, salty bacon (albeit thin and few) was able to rescue this mushy mess of a carb-filled, diabetes inducing bomb. The total damage was $16.50, rather steep for a breakfast item. The thick cut of bread and the banana filling was a creative idea, though it needs to be executed out differently, perhaps by balancing it with slices of thickly cut crunchy, salty bacon, or elevated with a high protein dairy such as mascarpone or Greek yogurt.  \\n\\n- Loaded potato ladke (or pancake) - $9 for 2; side ham - $3.50\\n         Fried to a crisp, soft and chewy inside. This was flavorful , but on the greasy side and not filling without a side of ham or similar protein. \\n\\n- Eggs benedict - $15\\n        Your standard fare, creamy and delicious.

The kids were screaming, the spouse and I, hungry and disappointed.

While the other parental unit got the kids ready for bed, I hopped over to Sushi-A-Go-Go and picked up three rolls - a Trio (salmon, yellowtail, tuna), a Sunshine (salmon, avocado, and mango), and a Summertime (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna mix, avocado).   \\n\\nIn two shakes of a lamb's tail, I was back home, stories were being read to the kids, and I set the table.  And once the kids were down, we pounced.  Mmmmmmmmm.  The Trio was the best - just fish and rice - fresh and chock full of fish.  The Sunshine was a bit different, but we liked it - the mango sweetness was a bit surprising but good.  The Summertime rocked - I was particularly impressed that the tempura stayed nice and crunchy to the last bite.\\n\\nOne side note - you should take the closing time (8pm or until ingredients run out) seriously.  It's probably worth calling ahead if you are heading over close to 8pm, just to make sure they aren't out of anything.  We actually ordered 5 rolls, but turned out they only had enough rice for 3 (it was about 7:30pm).  But it was OK - the rolls were big, and it was enough food for two as it turned out.

I've been putting off reviewing IP for some reason despite eating there on almost a weekly basis. \\n\\nI'd like to say that I've had Indian food all over town (well towns, let's say Greater Boston) and in other parts of the country as well, and there's just something about India Palace that I always seem to prefer over others.\\n\\nIt's not cheap, but then again my g/f and I are ordering enough food to feed all 1 billion+ in Indian so I guess I should expect it to be a little high for takeout. We tend to get the 2 app sampler platters, an entree, and a naan to share and sometimes (okay rarely, it's my fault) have leftovers for lunch the next day. As I write this I actually wonder if the samplers are actually the way to go in terms of value....hmmm probably not but there's not a thing in either that I don't crave every 8 days or so. The pakoras are crisp little fritters (usually, if we get there late or do delivery the can get a little soft), both the veg and meat samosas are like little Christmas presents with food inside- but the best part is even the wrapping paper is edible, the various tandoori meats and kebabs that come in the meat platter are all yummy and (again, usually- see pakoras for more info) very moist.\\n\\nFor entrees I go with either the chicken tika masala, the chicken makhni, or the malai kofte. All three are just the right mix of sweet, creamy, and spicy. In reality the only entree I've ever really disliked at IP was a vindaloo that tasted as though they threw way too much anise in- it was so bitter and licorice-y I couldn't take it.\\n\\nFor naan we usually go with either onion or garlic because we don't care about offensive breath if it means tasty tasty flat bread. The aloo naan is also up there for us, but for me I've yet to have a naan/paratha/pori I didn't like there.\\n\\nIf you're eating in I'd also suggest ordering a sweet lasi- it's not a really friendly and brave collie it's a yogurt based drink that's sort of like an Indian milkshake and they are goooooooooood.\\n\\nPro tip #1: If you're getting take out or delivery tell them on the phone \\"I have a coupon\\" (not I, Paul M., you- but you say I...get it? Good) and they'll take $3.00+ off your bill depending on the total price (it scales up w/ cost i.e. $30+  is like $4 off etc.)\\n\\nPro tip #2: Ask for the mint/green chutney. They tend not to include it unless you specifically ask, but I try to use this stuff on everything and then lick the container when it's done. Okay at home, creepy at the restaurant.\\n\\nPro tip #3: If you want one kickass lunch special, go here. It's like $7 all you can eat with a nice assortment of apps, entrees, and sides. Their buffet isn't the biggest I've seen, but they hit all the staples and the food is still better than most restaurants ordered dishes (i.e. not sitting in a hot line for hours).\\n\\nThe staff are super friendly, though that may just because I'm basically on a first name basis with them.

We had the apple pie, the cookie shake, and the hazelnut shake, and they were all winners!\\n\\nThe only thing holding me back from giving this place a full five star review is that we had unusually long waits both times. The first time, they seated us but for some reason nobody assigned us a server.

Service 3/10 -  The owner (or who ever that person was at the counter) sounded and acted very rudely.  His attitude might be because of high demand for Indian food in this area.  You have to wait in line to order food and then take a number to your table.\\n\\nFood is tangy but not well cooked.  Paper dosa is quite big and tastes good.

The eggs were fake (tasted fake) but fluffy, the cheese was good, the sausage was thin. The breakfast wrap was tiny with eggs, cheese, and bacon. The eggs were soggy, the bacon was flavorless, and the cheese was kinda icky (husband's words). \\n\\nThe coffee....the coffee was why I jumped on Yelp. I had to make sure everyone knew that the \\"coffee\\" was horrible. They allowed us to get the iced coffee with our meals since it was so hot out (im sure they do this often). Milk & sugar in both, although it didnt help the problem. The coffee was more like crap flavored water with the smallest hint of sugar  milk possible, packed full of crushed ice.....which is (hopefully) why the coffee was so dam horrible! Honestly..probbaly not but I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here. $2.50 for a small watery \\"coffee\\"...not cool! \\n\\n I've also tried their soup (I asked for chicken noodle, watched the kid pour potato...asked him if it was chicken noodle...and he still said yes..jerk!)

We wait 2 hours and get placed into the very last bay where the music is barely heard through the speakers. We told the rep waiting for us that it was too far and we wish to have something closer to music. He advised us to just go downstairs and make the request (which we already did). We wait, tell the guest services desk, and they put us back in the queue. The rep was clearly annoyed by this, and advised us they didnt know when we would have a bay. 30 mins passed by and we were worried the update was made incorrectly. Sure enough, we were placed at the bottom of the list. By 1am and 3 hours later, we just wanted to play.

Honestly they make Revolver and Matchstick seem like amateurs. I had two pour-overs (Brazil and a Yirgacheffe) and they were the most skillfully roasted and brewed coffees I have had in Vancouver. The complexity and delicacy of flavor they bring out is absolutely incredible. Both cups were delicious down to the bottom of the cup, unlike other brewers in town that leave a bunch of sediment or where the coffee is overextracted, underextracted, or burned by the time you get there. They mostly use Kalita waves and pitchers for their pour-over, achieving a higher consistency. They roast their own beans and I'm pretty sure they have the best roaster in town.\\n\\n3 stars for the location and layout. They're in a more touristy area that thinks it's hipster and is a bit more out of the way for locals. Also their layout looks cool (looks like a train...) but isn't very functional when it's a bit more crowded: their booths seat 6 very uncomfortably or combinations of groups of 4, 2, or 1.

The hostess was polite and seated us right away. My date and I realized that the seating was a bit awkward for us; it was a corner booth that made us sit next to each other and not across. However, the hostess was nice enough to seat us elsewhere. The ambience is really nice; clean, sleek, hip and modern would be the words to describe the place. For dinner the place is pretty dim despite all the windows that let the lights from surrounding venue shine in.\\n\\nThis was the first place I ever tried sushi and it was a good experience. My date and I started with California rolls, which were very good. As I recall, you get twelve rolls per order. For my main course I had a medium cooked steak with a side of macaroni and three cheeses. Both were excellent, though the price for what you got was a bit high. Service during this first time was great and our waiter was very friendly and helpful in describing certain dishes on the menu.\\n\\nMy second time at Strip was lunch with some friends. The place gets filled quickly on a Friday afternoon so get there early or make reservations. My friends and I came for lunch after we heard they had a chef's special for ten dollars; this special includes a good-sized salad with vegetables, the entr√©e of the day, and cheesecake for dessert. The salad was very filling, especially since it was dressed up with baby tomatoes, spinach and other goodies. The entr√©e on the day we went was blackened shrimp on top of steamed rice and vegetables. The shrimp were very spicy, but still good. I'm not a fan of cheesecake and had it replaced with a slice of carrot cake instead. The icing was amazing and really stood out in flavor. However, things went downhill during our entr√©e portion of the meal.\\n\\nFirst of all, our waiter started to become very inattentive to us. He seemed to have been spread throughout the restaurant, serving customers; I think Strip should designate certain areas of their venue to waiters so that waiters can keep a good eye on their customers. Not once did our server refill out waters; we had three different servers pass by and do it for us. Also, one of my friends did not enjoy her meal, to which the manager who passed by offered to replace it with something else. When our waiter passed by our table when the plate was returned, he did not bother to question what happened to her plate; he even went as far as to look away from our table and ignore us as he passed by! It was very disappointing to see that. Because of that we ended up giving him a 10% tip, though as my friends and I discussed the matter when we left, we felt he should have been lucky we didn't change our minds and leave nothing.\\n\\nOverall, the food is good, the price is a bit high, and the service seems to have gone downhill. I do want to make a note of appreciation for the workers who were not assigned to serve us for refilling our waters and asking how we were doing; they would have gotten our 20% tip if it were possible."},{"name":"Urban Hibachi","address":"3120 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Service is terrible.

We confirmed over three separate phone calls that the suite would have a balcony, two bathrooms, and a pull out couch, as we were going to share the suite with another couple.  \\n\\nAfter finding the hotel (note the name issue above), we found that the suite had one bathroom the size of a phone booth, no balcony, and only half the blinds were remaining in the large room with the pull out bed (SUPER bright sunrise). \\n\\nWifey called the front desk to see if we could switch to another suite that matched what we had booked, but the hotel was full for the night.  She then asked if they could do anything on the $259/nt rate that we had booked, and with little hesitation they dropped our rate to $159 (as if this happens quite often).  Additionally, when housekeeping arrived to bring the extra sheets for the pullout, (that were not stocked ahead of time,) the employee was very annoyed that we asked for pillows. He leaned into the room, nodded to the decorative pillows that had been there since the 70s, and rolled his eyes when my wife said \\"those aren't clean enough to sleep on.\\" He begrudgingly returned with pillows that had seen far better days.  \\n\\nOn to the bar.  We were out for a Friday wedding, and were trying to decide if we should stock the \\"suite\\" with some libations for the after party, or simply go to the lobby bar.  (Side note - the room did not have a fridge.) We called the bar to see if they would stay open past midnight if people from the wedding would come back for some beverages.  They confirmed as long as four of us were present, they would stay open till midnight, so we did not make a beer run nor stock the room.  After the wedding, we got back to the hotel around midnight, and went into the bar which still had several guests.  We tried to order a round, but the manager stated that the registers had been closed for the night, and there was no way to ring another check.

The party that went on was actually a really big group of people, and everyone fit in pretty tight in snug on the right side of the restaurant. And to get to the point: the Chicken was alright. Specifically what I had was the Soy Garlic and what came out of that choice was that there wasn't so much in the soy garlic flavor but more honey/sugary.\\n\\nWhich ultimately made me feel that a high rating is lacking from this place was that it boiled down to the chicken. Why does everything have to be sweet? I mean I get it, put some honey in there but if you're going to advertise it, I would hope to get a bang with that soy sauce and garlic flavor. You would think you would get a more savory dish rather than a sweet one and this was kind of a let down. \\n\\nThe good things about this place: it looks like it's a mom and pop shop. So the feeling of family is definitely there. They were very nice to us and that feeling means a lot and can take them far. If I came back I would definitely try the other options, and maybe ask which ones were sweet and which weren't.

This pub was and continues to be a great addition to the UBC dining scene.  It's an almost-classic Irish pub, a bit on the hipster side in order to please the university crowd.  \\n\\nThe dining is not gourmet, but it is acceptable pub grub.  The lamb dishes are usually pretty good, and most dishes tend to be on the salty, intensely flavoured side of things.  IMO, adding Irish soda bread would make the menu more classic.  \\n\\nThis place can get VERY noisy and crowded at mealtimes, especially when the patio is not open, and customers should be aware that they might have be seated at a very tiny table bumping elbows with other diners.  The staff often are overworked and overrun by the crowd, leading to occasional neglect of customers, but they are always cheerful enough.\\n\\nIn sum, a good university pub, with private tables (as opposed to the Koerner Pub) and within an easy walk of the main campus (as opposed to Biercraft)."},{"name":"Pappas Catering - Austin","address":"6513 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Of all the wonderful vendors I hired for my wedding, Pappas Catering was the best!

It is the greatest thing that has happened to Merritt Island since the space program and is an oasis of great food and service in a desert of really mediocre, processed food chains. The food is always fresh, exciting and bold. It is all about the ingredients and the service. (Did I mention the wine list) The quality and freshness of the food can take your breath away. If there is something seared on the menu, try it... it is always seared perfectly. I love the tuna! The fish is always so well prepared and local fresh. You must try the shrimp and grits. The grits are so creamy, like nothing that you have had before. The chef is like a mad scientist, always thinking up new and exciting ways to prepare and present the food. This is complimented by excellent service that is attentive, but not dominating. What is even better than the incredible treats on the menu (which changes all the time) is that Merritt's Table is not pretentious or stuffy; it is a relaxed and homey atmosphere that makes you feel like you are sitting at someones kitchen table or, when outside you are sitting in someones back yard with a fountain and garden. Now, the wine list... the wine list is like no other in the area, and if you are unsure of wines, you should ask for a recommendation; their recommendations are always on the mark. The list is made up of micro wineries that most of us have not heard of, but is full of elegant and relatively inexpensive wines that complement food rather than compete with it. Did I tell you about the duck breast? One of the non-local foods, flown in from a special farm in Long Island and prepared in such a special way that it melts in your mouth. Usually, I am not a big fan of duck (unless it is Peking duck) because I find that it is not prepared properly; this ain't that kind of duck; try it, you can thank me later. At lunch time they will smoke pastrami and make some of the best pastrami sandwiches that you have ever had. When the hamburger is on the lunch menu, you have to try it; add the poblano pepper and cheese for a cheeseburger that will make you forget all of the others. And, I haven't even started talking about the desserts! OMG! The problem is that you usually want every dessert on the menu - I have asked about a sampler platter for us who have problems with decisions. The homemade desserts, to include the ice creams and sorbets are an incredible way to end an evening. If you want elegant food, with great wine and even better service, without the pretense of some stuffy, semi-formal environment, come to Merritt's Table.

This place is the best boba place I've been to. The most striking difference between this place and all other boba places I've been to is that they don't use syrup here: all the flavors are natural, and while the combinations are very unique and different, they definitely work together well and taste fantastic.\\n\\nI've tried The Godfather, Foggy Bottom, and Green Gables (in that order) so far and have made it my goal to try all the flavors here.\\n\\nIndividual thoughts on each so far:\\n\\nThe Godfather: I tried it without boba because they'd run out by 4 pm that day. While strawberry and green tea at the same time might seem like one would overwhelm the other flavor, they both balanced out perfectly and tasted very natural.\\n\\nFoggy Bottom: best milk tea I've ever had. The lavender flavor is there but not too strong, and there's also vanilla but I didn't notice it.\\n\\nGreen Gables: Very refreshing. I appreciate those small pineapple chunks in there.\\n\\nStaff is very friendly and really care about customer satisfaction.

We had booked a reservation on open table and even then it wasn't that crowded which allowed for the servers to provide us with a lot of attention.  \\n\\nFirst impression was awesome, especially if you get a table by the window, you will get a splendid view of Boston from across the harbor.  Our server was very nice and she helped make suggestions for our meal.  Another thing i wanted to point out was that the manager ended up stopping by to ask how everything was going.  i feel as though many restaurants have lost sight of that personal touch during the years, but this place obviously hasn't.  \\n\\nThe bread was brought to the table and it came with a butternut hummus instead of butter.  This was a pleasant variation from what most restaurants have to offer.  As I am writing this I am regretting the fact that i didn't order some to take home.  Hummus lovers should definitely come hear for the bread if not anything else. \\n\\nWe kicked off the meal with a bottle of 2008 Reisling, Clean Slate from Germany.  Our server had recommended it to us.  The wine had a slightly fruity taste and only ran about 35 dollars.  \\n\\nWe both ordered the tuna, cucumber, crackers, and wasabi sauce for an appatizer.  The tuna was very fresh and lightly grilled and then crusted.  \\n\\nDinner was amazing.  I got the stuffed lobster and my gf got the duck.  I really enjoyed the stuffing in the lobster although i really cannot say what was in it.  It was served with a side of beans and sausage.  This is definitely an interesting combo.  As for the duck, it was one of the best tasting duck i have ever had.  I am not sure what sace was used but it has a succulent flavor that lead to just wanting to savor the taste.  It was also served with a crusted cheesy potato cake that compares to what my buddies dad makes every year for Christmas dinner (this is a good thing).  \\n\\nDesert was a chocolate peanut-butter cheese cake.  If that combination sounds good to you, then trust me, it was just as good as it sounds.  \\n\\nA place like this would likely appeal more to those visiting Boston since it is located right off Hotel Road near the airport.  I actually had trouble finding the place because my GPS took me in some crazy route.  One important thing to note is that if you dine in the restaurant, valeting your car is only $5.  \\n\\nMy ownly other complaint was the party taking place right above the restaurant.  It was a college formal and the bass and music ended up resonating into the dining area.  Other than this minor issue, this place was great.\\n\\nFellas, this is an awesome date spot especially when the weather is nice.  you can access the waterfront right from the restaurant where you can walk around and look at Boston.

My wife had the fish.\\n\\nOkay, let me just start by saying that the proprietor is from Brownsville Texas and I am from Corpus Christi, Texas ( well, Flour Bluff, actually ) and that means that our shared seafood palate is right in line. This meal was like driving four hours to go home and then finding that the overall quality of the seafood had only doubled since I left! the shrimp was expertly cooked to be soft and hot and chewy and the batter was a flavor of batter I have not had since I left home those decades ago. But the care taken was above and beyond what I mostly got in the crappy causeway dockside dive seafood eateries down on the coast. The veggies were fresh and crisp and paired in amounts nicely tailored to add to the flavor profile without hiding the awesome shrimp in the taco. The sauce in the taco was light and flavorful and creamy and complimented everything nicely. If you love that Gulf-coast seafood flavor, this place is ready to bring it home to you!\\n\\nLet's not forget the Chicken Gumbo. Thick, meaty. hearty delicious. East Texas style. light brown, not the southern Louisiana-style dark brown blackened b√©chamel base. It was thick enough to be satisfying and not bitter and heavy enough to weigh you down. I loved it. I'll go back for more.  \\n\\nSo in closing, good service by good, down-south Texas people, in a laid-back, maragaritaville-spirited environment in the middle of town.

I was excited to share this with my family whom I don't see often as it is difficult to gather us all together. \\n\\nI made the reservation for 9:30pm knowing that they close at midnight.

Some of my family had arrived earlier than me, as I was running late, when I arrived at 9:42pm my family let me know that the server had told them that they would be doing last call at 10:30pm... 1.5 hrs before closing time. Annoyed that we would likely only get two orders in, we carried on with our meal.\\n\\nAt 10:12 we put our second order in, double checking we could put another order in at last call at 10:30 if we were missing any items (this happens often) or wanting more food. The server let us know that this would be our last order and told us, that we should just order more. I tried to reason with her given that they closed at midnight.. but she was not changing her mind. \\n\\nFrustrated, I tried to enjoy my birthday meal with my family. At 10:45 the server showed up with the debit machine next to our table saying, that they were closing down their machines and would like us to pay. I was extremely disappointed and frustrated, given that we had only been here an hour and they had rushed our last order, and now were rushing us to pay. I went to speak to the manager who just repeated that they needed payment now, but we could stay until 11:45pm. \\n\\nServer appeared abruptly after again to take payment, made a mistake adding more money than she should, and rolled her eyes when we asked her to correct the mistake.

By this point I was extremely frustrated and noticed my family was equally upset with the lack of service and unwillingness to accommodate or be polite. \\n\\nWe finished our meals, hastily, with the workers two tables over having their own hot pot dinner in plain sight and left the restaurant.

We ate brunch on Friday, June 13th at Mother's Bistro and Bar, arriving around 10:30am. There was a line to the corner. We headed to the front to put our name on the list. They told me there was a 20-30 minute wait and would text me when my table was ready. We were OK with that and wandered around the immediate neighborhood while we waited. When we got the text 30 minutes later, we headed to the hostess station and saw Chef Schroeder. She was identifiable by her chef's jacket with her name embroidered on the front. I had also read a review of the restaurant in a pamphlet the night before and had seen her name so it was familiar to me. She was storming around and yelling at one of the two hostesses about how they were seating the tables, and actually got into a shouting match with the blonde hostess. Once Chef Schroeder stomped off to seat some people, I said to the blonde hostess that it was uncalled for the way that she was spoken to, no one should ever speak to an employee like that. She said, \\"I know,\\" and she seemed really unhappy and upset. Then the other hostess seated us.\\n\\nWe got seated in the back by the restroom. The service was slow but our first waiter was nice. At some point they gave us a different waiter but didn't tell us why. My husband ordered coffee, I ordered tea. He ordered an omelette and a side of bacon, I ordered the belgian waffle with fresh Oregon strawberries and fresh Oregon cream with a scrambled egg on the side. My husband loved his omelette and the bacon was great, our coffee and tea was excellent. My waffle itself was crispy on the outside and fluffy and moist on the inside. The whipped cream was perfect. The egg was super fresh, cooked more well than I usually like but still really good. The problem I had was with the strawberries.\\n\\nThe strawberries were ice cold in the middle, one or two even had ice crystals. I have eaten my share of diner strawberries on pancakes and I know what a frozen strawberry tastes like. These tasted like that. I was expecting fresh sliced strawberries, not cold syrupy strawberries. I didn't like them. So when the waiter was about to bring the check, I told him I wasn't happy with the strawberries and thought they were frozen but that everything else was great. The waiter looked very disappointed and said he would go talk to the manager.\\n\\nIn storms Chef Schroeder. She did not ask me what was wrong, or apologize. She instead berated me for \\"accusing\\" her of having frozen strawberries. She said that they don't use frozen strawberries. I said that they tasted frozen. She said they cut them fresh that morning. I said that they were ice cold and some were frozen. She said, \\"Well, maybe our refrigerator is too cold, but we don't even put sugar on them.\\" I have no idea how they got all syrupy then. (See the picture.) She said that Oregon strawberries are different than regular strawberries and basically said that I didn't know what I was talking about and they would never use frozen ingredients. She did say that they would take the strawberries off the bill. She did not make me feel like she cared. She had absolutely no customer service skills.\\n\\nI work in customer service, and this should have been handled differently. She should have said hello and ASKED me what the problem was. She should have listened to my complaint. She should have apologized, and meant it, then explained her side of the story. She could have asked me where I was from and taught me that Oregon strawberries have a different shape than what I'm used to in the grocery store. She then could have offered to look into why the strawberries were so cold and then offered to take them off the check. Ta da! Same EXACT outcome as what happened, except with me and my husband willing to come back to the restaurant and willing to recommend it to friends and family. Instead, what happened is that we told six total strangers about the bad treatment we got there that day because we were so put off by it. We are moving to Portland, OR in a month and even though we enjoyed the food, we will not eat there again. Nor will we be bringing our friends, our parents (mine may be moving there as well, his may be spending winters in Portland), or anyone else we entertain.

Next time you go in, if you are a patron, check it out for yourself.  You will be as grossed out as I was.\\n\\nI guess I just want clean now after watching all those episodes of Kitchen Nightmares.  Which makes me wonder why every restaurant owner doesn't watch so they can see the how important it is to have a clean cooking area."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty good breakfast place.  Lots of tasty options.  Service was great.  We ordered a greek fritata, biscuits and gravy and Mikes scramble.  Food was good but not great.  Would probably give this place a 3.5 stars if I could."},{"name":"Bun Cha Ca Hoang Yen","address":"5083 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"First off, I would rate this a 6 out of a 5 if there is a 6 as an option, i'd never had the best pho ever. their lemon grass chicken is on point, straight up saigon style. if you want to try out traditional vietnamese dishes, you guys must try this place out."},{"name":"Sundaze","address":"4304 Clawson","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The vegan fried chicken sandwich is amazing. Braved the flooding we had a few weeks ago just to pick one of these up! Definitely pair it with the vegan ranch!"},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay, We went for lunch buffet we were disappointed. \\n\\nTaste not good\\nLess choices."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Clearly Punjabi Dhaba is popular. I never been in there when it wasn't completely full. A negative for me.  I hate standing around and feeling like I'm in everyone's way.  My main issue though is the food. Its not bad by any means but there are just too many Indian food options in the Boston area for me to get too excited. The Chicken Tikka Masala is very under seasoned. In fact most dishes lack the proper seasoning. On the upside it is cheap and close to home. Just not my favorite option for Indian Food."},{"name":"El Inka","address":"8560 SE DIVISiON St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was our first experience with Peruvian food; we are huge Mexican food fans, though.  The eating area is very small and very warm (because of the rotisserie oven) and a soccer match in Spanish was blaring on the television, if anyone is concerned with ambiance.\\n\\nThe server was nice and accommodating, but couldn't explain much.  It was hard to tell if it was a language barrier or if he just didn't know how to describe the dishes and sauces.\\n\\nI had the 1/4 chicken with rice and salad.  The chicken was very good, but not moist, falling-off-the-bone as some Yelpers have described it.  I was particularly impressed with the yellow sauce: kinda creamy, rich, and a little spicy all at the same time.  My wife had shredded chicken with milk gravy (?) and she raved about how good it was and I enjoyed the bite I had.\\n\\nI would definitely go back, and would want to try some of the other meat dishes; We will see you there soon!"},{"name":"Milk & Honey","address":"1082 Huff Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is now closed.\\n\\nI'm saddened because I want more restaurants in this area. Nuevo Laredo is always hopping, Bone Garden seems to be pretty steady but those are really all we have west of Howell Mill except weekday-lunch-only places like Carver's and Olympic Flame."},{"name":"Moxie's Grill & Bar","address":"180 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"We sat at the bar lounge.  But we waited a while to be greeted and seated and there were only 2 people there. One sitting at the bar and one in the lounge. We only had drinks and appetizers. Calamari & chicken wings are OK. The portions are too small. I had the sangria and it was good! The best sangria I've ever had so far. The service was too slow. The bartender is not friendly."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is the business, so good.

We love going for lunch and getting a half sandwich and small bowl of pha. It is pure comfort food. I could eat here every week."},{"name":"Atlantic Kitchen","address":"1374 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"Seafood is not as fresh. A little over priced. Service was ok. Crab cakes not bad. Crawfish not as good. Just the location is a bit convenient for me.

The atmosphere was comfy, the staff extremely friendly, and the service very prompt!  \\n\\nI had the Chuna Melt which is kind of like tuna salad, but without the cruelty.  The wait was only a few minutes, and I got to chat with the staff while I was waiting.  \\n\\nMy husband had the Seitan Slam, and he absolutely loved it.  When he eats gluten, he really wants to enjoy it, and this was a very tasty treat for him.  \\n\\nI don't think either sandwich last ten minutes.  We love that O2 Vegan Cafe is a completely vegan establishment.  They are few and far between, and finding one that serves delicious food is difficult!  We will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"A must try in Coolidge Corner - I have never had anything here that I didn't love!  Seriously - from banana stuffed french toast to the chicken matzo ball soup - it is delicious!  \\n\\nThe only thing that deturs me sometimes is the long wait for a table and the fact that the menu can be a bit overwhelming because of the large variety of options.\\n\\nHow can you go wrong with a place that serves you bagel chips and cream cheese while you wait?"},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Hadn't been here in a few years, still good. Bagel chips before the meal are enjoyable. The potato pancakes really pale in comparison to Joan and Ed's in Framingham - not really all that crisp. The deep fried foods seem oilier than I remember. Pickles are nice."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went here again last week with my family who was in town for Thanksgiving. Waitress was moody and argumentative, drinks weren't made correctly several times, and they've changed the presentation of several menu items inexplicably. The michelada no longer comes with Negra Modelo (yeah, sounds weird, but tastes oh so good), the hangar steak presentation has changed (no avocado, less tomato, etc), the wild boar ribs didn't come with the awesome blue cheese and were spread out over a plate rather than stacked, etc. They also kept propping the back door open so the band could bring in instruments (it was ~40 outside) and everyone in the restaurant was freezing. Still good, but definitely not one of my better experiences here."},{"name":"Po Boy","address":"67 Crafts St","city":"Newton","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is amazing here and Eric is by far the most welcoming host we have ever met. \\n\\nGet two of everything!"},{"name":"BrickTop's","address":"3280 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste 100","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Overall great restaurant!  The Chicken Chowder is awesome!  My recent visit was not so great as hair was discovered in my Three Cheese Macaroni!

It's so out of the way and we were totally skeptical the first time we ate here that the food would be good, but it's amazing! Super fresh salads and truly the best hamburger I've had in town.
