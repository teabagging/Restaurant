But unlike many who have posted here about how great this place is, I must be one of the few people who have actually had great pizza in other places. Not in Atlanta, but certainly in the northeast. The tripping over their private parts by some of the writers here is hilarious, and simply put, the opinions are entirely, unequivocally, incredibly ignorant & without scope. Because, in a nut shell, it's NOT worth every penny. Bottom line: pizza is not supposed to be a meal that breaks out to $12-15 per person for a 14\\" pie. No matter what you're argument to the contrary might be. You know you might be in trouble when the prices are obnoxiously posted in Euros first, and dollars second. Hey, Gio, you're not in Italy. \\n\\nHere's the dirty little secret that no pizza joint owner wants you to know. It's right up there with coffee as one of the most profitable, high margin items that is sold in a restaurant/shop.

But anyways, now that we have the disclaimer out of the way... \\n\\nDuring my most recent visit, my friend and I both ordered the filet, our usual :). It is the most flavorful and tender piece of meat that just melts in your mouth. Like previously mentioned, the steak came out on a hot plate with sizzling butter. I love cutting my steak and sliding the piece around in the butter before eating it hahaha. My friend and I also tried the crispy lobster tail, lobster mac & cheese, and shoestring fries. The sauce for the crispy lobster tail was too sweet for my taste. It came in a spicy creamy sauce, so it had a nice kick to it, but overall it was just okay. The combination of flavors reminded me of honey walnut shrimp and the sauce in orange chicken. I loved the lobster mac & cheese. It was rich and creamy and it also had a spicy kick to it, which I loved loved loved. We didn't finish it though because our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs when it comes to ordering food. :) The shoestring fries were no bueno. Maybe because of their thinness, some of them were way over-fried and tasted burnt. They looked cute in their napkin cone holder, but that's about all I can say for that item on the menu. And the creamed spinach side was a no go for me. It was very bland and...vegetabley. Maybe that's what healthy tastes like. Oops. \\n\\nMoving on to the best part of dinner......dessert. I know people go to steakhouses to eat steak, but the cr√®me br√ªl√©e is a MUST. Okay, granted... this one time around, we had no room for dessert, but Ruth's Chris has the best cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Anyone else who says different.....needs to message me the name of their spot ASAP because I don't want to be missing out LOL. Their cr√®me br√ªl√©e isn't overly sweet, which is perfect for me, and it isn't overly rich and oily/creamy like sometimes cr√®me br√ªl√©e can be. I don't know how to describe this oiliness that I'm referring to LOL but you know how sometimes heavy cream can leave that weird oily film on the roof of your mouth? That's kind of what I'm referring to. RIP to me if no one understands this. ANYWAYS, it comes in a shallow ramekin topped with cute little berries and a sprig of mint. Gorgeoussss and totally instaworthy.\\n\\nSo overall, my latest experience was good. The service was decent, but nothing to write home about. I had the most fun watching a nearby table on their date. Maybe they weren't on a date, but it looked like a date to me, so we shall call it a date. The woman was texting under the table throughout the meal and the man looked kind annoyed/disengaged while drinking his beer. There were moments of absolutely zero conversation. At one point, I accidentally made eye contact with the man and it took all the willpower in me not to mouth \\"SORRY\\" lololol."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Went on a Thursday evening..

We went on a Thursday night around 6 and were seated right away.  The wait staff were quite entertaining, the food came quickly and the ambience was great.  We shared a bottle of wine which of course only made the experience more enjoyable.  The only downside was that it's not a place where you sit afterwards and enjoy some conversation and coffee.

My friend and I split one as s starter, and I'd say this is the way to go. This stuff squashed most of the fall soups I've had! It was creamy but not overly heavy and very flavorful.

Walnut-pecan bread surrounding turkey, cheese, Granny Smith apple slices, and cranberry sauce. Like Thanksgiving in sandwich form, right? Wrong.\\n\\nIt comes cold!

It was MUCH better afterward, with the cheese melting on the turkey and the cranberry sauce soaking into the crispy bread. \\n\\nAlthough it sounds weird, I actually enjoyed the sandwich more the next day when I reheated the other half for lunch. Everything blended very well and made for a comforting meal. But I wouldn't order something just to be able to enjoy the leftovers!

We had made a reservation for ~10 people well in advance, but when we arrived (on time) we were told it would be an hour wait or we could have a table outside. An hour wait for a reservation?? Keep in mind it was about 30 degrees outside. We could see a few tables seated outside near small space heaters, but all of them were wearing winter hats, scarves, coats, etc. After about 10 minutes of awkwardly standing around discussing what we wanted to do (keep in mind there isn't a place to sit and wait) and a couple of us speaking to the host, they somehow managed to \\"find\\" two tables \\"from a reservation that didn't show up\\" that they could squeeze together for our group. Cool. \\n\\nSo we're seated at a high top table near the bar area. It was loud but that wasn't an issue for our group. After looking over the drink menu, most of us had decided to split bottles of wine with one or two other people. Our server had already had a kind of rude attitude, but hey we don't know how her day is going so we were just going to ignore it. She starts getting drink orders and checking ID's. When she came to me I handed her my ID, and she says \\"um this is expired\\". I was so confused. When I took it to check out what she had said, sure enough my ID has expired on my birthday. My birthday was LITERALLY less than a week prior to that night, and I had genuinely no idea it had expired.

BUT this review is based on food, not location, so here we go...\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both got the \\"Family Style\\" which is $24.95/person for all you can eat beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, potato salad, cole slaw and beans. To be honest, it was all disappointing. We walked in and walked past the cooking meats, which LOOKS amazing, so I was excited to dig in. The sausage was my favorite, but not because it was anything spectacular. The pork ribs were hard to chew and lacked flavor. I'm used to beef brisket that melts in your mouth and this was chewy, with no seasoning. The cole slaw has zero flavor. The beans are confusing. I expected a smoky, bbq flavor and they're literally like pinto beans. The potato salad was probably the best side, but not life changing. They were out of pickles when we came. We watched other people get their food before us, when they were seated AFTER us, and we had to ask for silverware after our food was served.\\n\\nWe have one more day in Texas, and are hoping to find a different restaurant that can redeem Texas BBQ for us."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A nice place, high end urban environment that I've come to expect from the new Fort Point.

Do that.\\n\\nFirst of all, the service was absurdly fast. Maybe it was because of the early seating, but it was bang boom amazingly fast. I almost wish it were slower because I felt a little rushed, but maybe us ordering only one entree each signaled a less traditional, lingering meal.\\n\\nI got the gnocchi. Amazing. Just so incredibly light and pillowy! It was really a gnocchi revelation. The sauce with delicious and lamb-y, but damn. That texture. My friend got the bolognese. I have to say that the hand made pasta here is great, and it had a certain bite that you don't get with a box of Barilla at home. I want more gnocchi.\\n\\nI will echo everyone else about the portions... if you intend on eating one item as an entree. The formal Italian dinner structure is a much more multi-course meal than the American dinner with a starter, primo, and secondo among others. This structure is part of their menu format, but I don't think people pay enough attention. This means that their pastas (primo) are meant to be eaten as a course in addition to secondo (carne or pesce) and not as a stand-alone entree. Of course, this leads to a very expensive full meal, so many (myself included) just get one. \\n\\nThe dessert tiramisu was large and delicious - I think I could really taste the marsala. It was also pretty large for a $9 dessert which I think further reflects that the portions of the place aren't all tiny but that pasta is meant to be eaten in addition to a meat course.\\n\\nI suggest that you savor your dish at Terramia, and if your belly still feels too empty, head to the alley next to Bricco for a loaf of ciabatta and good olive oil afterwards."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"In a bind as not too many other places in walking distance open this late.

Reviewers who say that are missing several points.\\n\\n1. Pizza is not \\"made quickly\\": it's pre-made with fixed toppings. You cannot possibly get a pizza made to order from scratch in less than 5 minutes. It's pizza as an assembly line.\\n\\n2. You can't even order a simple cheese pizza if that's what you want. It's their way or the highway: that's the way to maintain an assembly line, by fixing the possible combinations of toppings.\\n\\n3. Crust tastes decent, but it's a floppy crust, much more so than normal. The pics are deceptive: they look enticing, but you can't actually lift the slices by hand without toppings at risk of falling. It requires a lot of folding. Having a crust that floppy means it likely hasn't been baked long enough.\\n\\n4. Cheese and sauce are ordinary. Good, but there's nothing distinctive or special about it. I would have liked to try a plain cheese pizza to be sure.\\n\\nSo what you get is a pizza assembly line, with hastily cooked and likely underdone pizza. The materials are good, and the pizza is not bad, but it is nothing close to the best pizza one can have. All it takes little travel to other cities to figure that out, especially Chicago, New York, and Rome (the one in Italy). Haven't tried many places in Atlanta, but would venture there's better pizza here as well."},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love coming here with kids for their early bird special on Sunday evening.

The prices of pizzas are understandable, but the drinks are a little expensive in my humble opinion.\\n\\nOne bad part: the cashiers are a little too arogant, the menu and ingredients of pizzas are written in Italian.

With a few songs here and a few dollars there, my eyes were not distracted by the queens in all their glory. My eyes, however, had met their destination- the menu. And if the costumes hadn't given me a clue, a quick glance over the options told me that this place was no ordinary diner.\\n\\nFirstly, you should know that I've waited for a while to review this place. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of dramatics (apparent inconsistency of food, service, and customer relations) associated with this restaurant when none were necessary to begin with. So I decided to wait for more than a few months to pass and let things congeal into what they are supposed to be by now.\\n\\nI carefully ordered the following items and for the following reasons:\\n1) Beer Battered Onion Rings ($3.99): This appetizer has gained popular status.\\n2) The Funk Monkey Burger ($9.95): For paying homage to Funky Monkey Wine Company (a sister restaurant) that's right down the road\\n3) The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich ($9.90): Because the same batter for the onion rings was going to be coated over the chicken breast. I liked where this was going... \\n4) Phone Home ($6.99): Wha... a handspun milkshake that's got part of my blog name? Gotta try it.\\n\\nThe Onion Rings were all they were promised to be- amazing. A tad on the oily side, these rings had a flake-factor that some restaurants would vie for. It's a recipe worth safe-keeping in a vault. Word is that the beer the use for the rings is Pabst Blue Ribbon! Imagine that.\\nThe continuation of the special fry batter was evident in the Buffalo Chicken Burger. In ordinary circumstances, the chicken breast would have been tossed in buffalo sauce after receiving its crunch coat, but we opted to skip it in order to preserve its crisp couture as much as possible.  It was quite good decision and the product lived up to its expectation.  I recommend it.\\n\\nThe Funky Monkey Burger was a lesson in unsuccessful execution. All the main ingredients (Angus Beef, Fried Goat Cheese, Tomato Jam, Panko, and Almonds) made sense, but the way they came together was a disappointment. There were two main flaws- the goat cheese was PACKED on with panko. Being a drier tasting cheese, the panko only took it to the extreme. The other problem was the portion size of the tomato jam- a lot more of it would have given this burger the depth it really deserved.  These two proved to make the Burger lack juiciness. Additionally, I was asked while ordering how I would've liked my beef cooked and I had requested medium.  When it arrived, the burger was well done which only made the entr√©e drier. \\n\\nThe burger comes with your choice of a side- chips, fries, coleslaw, or macaroni salad.  Opting for the macaroni salad proved to be the mistake- it was the deadest thing on my tongue.  Tremendously bland, I had to jump-start it with quite a few shakes of salt and pepper before it even attained a weak pulse.\\n\\nThese technical errors made me question some previous reviewers- notably Scott Joseph's. Perhaps being a prominent figure in the Gay community, he was recognized prior to his dining experiences. When identity is known, it is my inference that the probability of a skewed review is high.\\n\\nOnto better news, our server spun me up a delicious milkshake made with Vanilla and Chocolate Ice Cream, crushed Reeses Cups, and Yoo-hoo. Utterly sweet and topped with an ultra-generous serving of whipped cream, it was so delicious and so filling. I took what I couldn't finish home and it held up perfectly in the fridge until the next day. It also happened to be the clincher of the entire experience: think about it- if a drag queen ('Miss Addison Taylor') can fix up a shake this good, Bananas definitely serves up a twist (hence, 'modern') on an American diner.\\n\\nIN A NUT SHELL: Go for the onion rings. If you're a night owl, you'll appreciate that they are open 24hrs on Friday and Saturday. Your dining experience on those late nights will be paired with a drag queen server who may consider to indulge you in a bombastic lip-sync number. And if you're coming from the clubs, please don't take it upon yourself to impress your friends with a 'Hot Wing Challenge.' INTENSE is probably a timid suggestion on how inexplicably spicy this sauce is. Delicious, but alarmingly provocative. Not only do you have to sign a medical release form, but you will be suffering the consequences the next morning at the Oval Office (*wink*). And if you're going for show and a place to see-and-be-seen rather than just a bite to snack on, Bananas definitely meets the expectation.  I, however, came for the food and it is my hope that it only gets perfected as this restaurant continues to evolve."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Had the creamy lobster.

We were lucky enough to find this Chinese Restaurant. We walked in and had a good amount of people in front of us. We were told that all take out orders would be between 30 mins to an hour. With what had happened and the line we totally understood and were just happy someone was opened and serving food. The owner had her young daughter helping them out with having people circle on the menu what they wanted just to try and speed things up. She was very adorable how she was with everyone. The mother kept cool and calm throughout the entire hour we were there. At one point she had to stop taking customers since the food supply had run out. People understood and went elsewhere. With every order the owner was giving everyone free drinks. I have to say we've been eating at Chinese restaurants all over the country from South Florida to New York City and never once had any restaurant owner show that much love towards their customers, not even with the free drinks but how apologetic she was that people had to wait that long for their meals. You see it on her face and heard it in her voice, they were so grateful that the hurricane did not do much damage to their business and that they were able to reopen so quickly. They have really won our business over with how they acted and treated their customers. Again never seen that ever before and are still blown away days later. We HIGHLY recommend coming here and giving them business. We will be back again and again. Also have to say our food was SPOT ON! I let my wife do the ordering and one of her favorite dishes was the boneless ribs, I'm not usually a fan of these, but HOLY COW were they PHENOMENAL and I will get those again.

When we couldn't find her, we just flagged down another waiter/waitress for service, who was happy to assist in her absence.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I traveled to The Salt Lick on a Wednesday evening around 7pm & were seated immediately. We entered the massive gravel-filled parking lot and knew that this is the place to be on weekends.

We chose to eat indoors on the beautifully crafted wood picnic tables.\\n\\nI struggled with choosing my meal from the menu as I typically do not eat BBQ (up our way, everyone drowns their meats in heavy sauces). Every item seemed very appetizing, but I eventually selected the Pork Ribs & Turkey Combo (served with potato salad, cole slaw & beans). \\nI picked the pork ribs as I've never eaten them before (I grew up on beef ribs). They were disappointing, unfortunately (a friend later told us he agreed that the pork ribs aren't the best). The turkey, on the other hand, was so damn delicious! The dry-rub was perfect for my taste buds.\\nMy boyfriend chose the Brisket & Turkey Combo plate. He raved about the brisket and I sampled a bite (dangit, I should've ordered that instead). He also enjoyed the turkey. \\n\\nI'm neither a potato salad nor a coleslaw fan (I hail from PA Dutch country so everything is creamy, sloppy and just plain nasty). Texas 'slaw and salad are prepared way differently so I tried them. I can't explain the potato salad much, other than its not creamy and has a brownish color instead. I tasted mustard, but not sure why type was used (brown vs Dijon, etc). I absolutely loved it and cleared my plate. I think I need to try and find a recipe online to make at home (did I just say that?).\\n\\nThe BBQ food here is literally fall-off-the-bone, so there's no need for a knife. The meats are slow-cooked perfectly over coals and NOT well-done (shame on those who want well-done meats, expect for pregnant women).

The salad itself was just some normal rag-a-muffin iceburg lettuce number..... uh, not Japanese at all. \\n\\nSushi was just okay, nothing special, but fresh and tasty. You could tell the people preparing the food either had no clue how to actually do it or just didn't care. The thin lemon slices on one roll just seemed out of place and rather ugly. \\n\\nService was a standout. Our server was wonderfully accessible, always there when we needed her but never when we didn't. My request for extra wasabi was honored in like 20 seconds which earner her a 30% tip. \\n\\nThe chef we had was kind of fun but not really. Not very talkative or worth watching.... he just made a lot of noise... and didn't really seem to have a handle on what he was doing. \\n\\nAll in all, I'd go back without hesitation because it's convenient, and fairly reasonable price wise.

It was at this point that we found out, and what would be a theme for the night, that they were out of the ingredients for several of the drinks because of their event.

It is a refreshingly new take on Mexican food from the Margaritas-type restaurants that are on every street corner these days. The menu is built of unique dishes, so for those who are not feeling adventurous, it may be best to avoid Acitron. However, if you are in the right mood, the food is delicious and the presentation is excellent. I would recommend the Chiles en Nogada; especially for a first-timer.

My first impression was that it was a very cool restaurant. Great seating, great ambiance and decor. I loved that you could see into the kitchen and see them cooking items in the stove. Our server was nice. The brunch menu had some unique options. I went with the Mac N Cheese and my friend got the ham and cheese. We actually ended up switching as the cheese wasn't that great in my dish. I liked that it came with a slice of pineapple and a salad though. His meal was amazing. Ham and eggs over beer battered cheese and buttered thick bread with home fries. Wow. Absolutely delicious. They also had a great beer selection on draft. My friend got a Boulevard Tank 7 and loved it. If you go, be sure to visit their bathrooms. I won't spoil it here, but it's really cool. For the food we got, the prices were fantastic.

I'm a beer person- they definitely have some specialty beers, but the regular stuff is so overpriced it's hard not to just drink water. $7 for an average, 5% saison? No thanks!\\n\\nThe other problem is their space. It's super crowded, as other reviews state. As in, wait an hour and a half on a Tuesday night after dinner hours. Not worth the wait unless you have a reservation.  They have an entire side room (likely for events) completely empty as you wait over an hour for your table for two. \\n\\nYes, they specialize in seafood, and yes, their seafood is expensive. Unfortunately, because it's Boston, I can think of five places to get the same quality for the half the price.\\n\\nI really wanted to love Row 34, as a beer and oyster lover, but it was just such a letdown."},{"name":"TooJay's","address":"10185 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"3.5","text":"I very neutral with this restaurant.

The place resembles Old San Juan and looks very nice!  I didn't find that people were as friendly as some indicated in their reviews.  We ordered our beverages and food once we were sifted.  The Menu was a little confusing.  I thought the prices were high.  For one section of the Menu (for example, I ordered \\"Asopao\\") you have to pay for any side order.  Most places will include \\"tostones\\" so I ordered a side order of tostones.  The tostones were plenty so they can be shared but They were cold and weren't crispy enough.  The food had a wonderful presentation but it was not as good as it looked.  The silverware we had to ask for so the food was not as hot when they brought it.  The live music was so loud we could barely hear our server or have a conversation at the table.  The Music I found was more appropriate for a Latin Bar not for background music.

The burgers are cooked on a fry-top grill after you ordered them and there are lots of toppings to choose from. The menu is simple....burgers, fries, drinks and not much else.  \\n\\nSo being someone that has eaten at a few Five Guys Burgers and Fries, here's what the newcomers should remember....\\n\\n1) The place is not too decorated like other burger joints. The floors are always messy because you can have a small plate of salty peanuts as you wait for your order to cook.\\n\\n2) A regular 'hamburger' or a regular 'cheeseburger' is a double burger so yes it's a big burger to eat. Cannot eat a regular burger, then order from little section where a 'little hamburger' or a 'little cheeseburger' has only one burger patty instead of two. \\n\\n3) No carry trays, you'll get your burger (wrapped in foil) and your fries in a portion cup in a paper bag. You can have free refills of drinks so best to not order a large drink. \\n\\n4) The portion for a burger, fries and drink is a lot larger than a order full value meal at other burger joints. sometimes it is best to share and order of fries if are going with somebody.\\n\\n5) Get plenty of napkins. The fresh cooked burger and the toppings will make a lot of stuff fall out. \\n\\n6) Each store will offer peanuts for their guests while they order and wait for their meals. It's a nice touch though the peanuts are more saltier than what you buy in a package from a store. \\n\\nSo now that you have my perspective on what to expect at Five Guys, all I can end up saying is good luck and enjoy your meal."},{"name":"Anchan House of Thai Food","address":"373 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here for my first time to lunch with my cousin and I was very pleased with my dining experience!

Arriving on a Saturday evening during prime dinner time, we were welcomed with friendliness and gracefully escorted through the bar crowd to our table.  Estelle's is up beat, no doubt about it, and we just felt giddy with that fun-night-out-at-a-new-place thrill.  So much so, actually, that I may have scared our server who seemed flustered when I asked, \\"What do you love here?  What's your favorite thing on the menu?  What does everyone rave about?\\" and responded by asking if he could please let us know the day's specials first.  (I never did hear his favorite dish, now that I think about it.)  \\n\\nPicking a favorite would be tough, actually.  How do you choose when nothing felt...well...special?  One side of the bread on my friend's po' boy was charred to a crisp.  Interesting-sounding deviled eggs got a \\"meh\\" reaction complete with a shoulder shrug when tasted.  The gumbo was so spicy, my husband (the guy who typically puts jalapenos in everything) was constantly leaning over to eat my food because he couldn't handle the heat of his own meal.  Luckily I had ordered the mother of all dishes, the buttermilk fried chicken, and it happened to come with a \\"side\\" of mac and cheese that basically could have been someone's main course.  So we all found a way to make do, and who am I to complain when there really wasn't anything wrong necessarily.  I had just been hoping for a little more.  (Even the complimentary dish of pickles at the start of the meal was a sad stand-in for what we all really wanted to kick things off: a basket filled with warm cornbread.)  \\n\\nStill, Estelle's feels like it's going the extra mile, from the way I saw the staff quickly rearranging furniture to make room for new parties to the chef's visit to our table at the end of our meal.

The onions and vegetables went very well with this. \\nGrilled pork - tender and flavorful.  ton of meat, ton of rice, lots of sides.  \\nChicken Katsu -  I got this monster today.  I opened it and man it looked GLORIOUS.  I thought \\"there must be a ton of rice under this chicken cause its about to spill over\\".  I lifeted upa  few pieces looking for the rice and then i thought \\"holy sh--.  this is a ton of chicken\\".   I kid you not, i was in disbelief.  The macaroni side is sooo good..  \\nBanh mi - I've had the original and the special.  Original has always been my favorite whereer I go and this is no exception.  The special is also very good.  This place really knows how to make bahn mi.  The meat int eh special and the original was so tasty!  The bread is CRUNCHY, i hate mushy bread bahn mi.  most important of all (besides the meat), the sauce - THE SAUCE.  homemade sauce makes this.  Lots of bahn mi places have crud sauce, and therefore they have crap mis.  I really really like FOT bahn mis.  \\n\\nMan this truck is quality and quantity for a VERY good price.  dollar for dollar some of the best food I've had.  good presentation for food and the truck itself looks FRESH."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!  the ambiance is amazing!!

This was by far the best brisket we had (although we didn't get the best of the best moist brisket from Franklin and only got chopped beef from La Barbecue, so take this statement with a grain of salt). The 1/4lb rib only amounted to only one rib, but that was fine with us since we had been eating so much on the trip already. The rib was tender and juicy, but there was a little too much pepper in the rub for us- still worth trying though!

Some years I haven't been down and others multiple times.  \\n\\nThe key to the park is knowing the tricks to getting through the rides as quickly as possible, because who wants to wait in line?\\n\\nFor starters, if you can afford it, stay onsite.  It is more expensive, but you get an unlimited express pass with it.  It's a pain switching hotels, but if you just stay onsite one night, you can use the express both the day before and after your stay, giving you two days with only one nights cost.  \\n\\nIf you can afford to stay onsite, then lines won't matter.  If you can't, then here's the trick.\\n\\nShows don't matter - you'll get in (unless perhaps on holiday's and the busiest days of the year).  Just show up for the shows 10 minutes early at most and you shouldn't have a problem getting in.  \\n\\nFor the rides, use the single rider lines.  You still go through the single rider queue with your entire group, you just don't sit with them.  Unless you have small kids that this is a problem with, this will save you lots of time.  We've walked right on rides sometimes in the single rider line and even had our group of 3 seated right next to each other or on the same car.\\n\\nThere are two coasters that are both a lot of fun.  The Mummy and the Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket.  Rip Ride Rocket is outdoors and the Mummy is indoors.  Both are great and very different.\\n\\nTwister, the Horror Makeup Show, Terminator 2D, Disaster, Beetlejuice graveyard review and Animal Actors are all essentially shows.  Some are more interactive than others though.  All are worth seeing if you haven't before.  Disaster, the Horror makeup show and Animal actors are all different each time - the other two are the same.  Horror make up is one of my favorites since they always pick someone from the audience and that alone is half the comedy of the show depending on the person they choose.  \\n\\nShrek 4D is worth a look as well.  It's a fun show/ride where your seat can move a bit.  The despicable me ride is new and was in technical rehearsal when I was there recently, but way too long a wait for what it is.  It's a motion movie ride, same as Jimmy Neutron was before it and Hannah Barbera was before that.  Decent, but not worth waiting hours, unless of course you have little kiddies that just must see it!\\n\\nMIB is another ride and a lot of fun.  You try to shoot aliens and build up a score.  Well worth riding a few times over and over. \\n\\nThe simpson's is also another great ride - Not one I do each trip, but worth doing if you haven't.  No single rider, so this is one where you have to wait.  It does handle a lot of people though.  You could simply make this the first ride of the day to avoid the lines.\\n\\nET might be worth doing if you've never done it, but I have and will never do it again.  It's just boring..  \\n\\nJaws and the entire amityville area is gone, but it didn't have much impact on our enjoyment.  \\n\\nWe always have a great time and just loop around the park a few times, hitting all the rides we like, usually multiple times and will often have lunch and dinner in the park.  \\n\\nIf you spend the whole day, especially when they are open 9am until 9pm, you can easily visit both parks and get a lot in at each park.  2-3 days is really plenty of time for Universal (although I could stay longer) and allows you to take in all the rides and shows."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Location was great.

Compared to the rest of Hanover St. it was great food for slightly cheaper prices. The fall back is that there are no reservations so you can expect to wait upwards of over an hour in order to get a seat in this rather small restaurant. \\n\\nI'm a patient person and I say that the wait was well worth it! After looking online for the opening times so that we could line up early, Chris and I got there half an hour early only to see that the house was already packed and a line had formed! At 4:30 when opening hours was supposed to be at 5! However, since it was still fairly early, we only ended up waiting half an hour before getting seated.\\n\\nFor appetizers we shared a small calamari and antipasto. The calamari was fresh and hot with just the right amount of seasoning. The peppers and cocktail sauce added another dimension to the dish that made it some of the best calamari I've ever had; and even better, it stayed hot for our entire meal! The soppresatta in the antipasto was great. In general, the antipasto served as a good pairing to the calamari. Very good! \\n\\nFor the main course we shared the house special -- Zuppa di Pesce in Fra Como sauce with White Zinfandel. This dish was a monster. It completely dwarfed the two seater table that we sat at. The waiter had to replate our appetizers and bread just to make sure everything fit. If you're a seafood lover you must get this dish! There's so much seafood and pasta that I was able to make two more meals out of the leftovers,...and this was after sitting there for two hours eating my heart out. If you like spicy red sauce definitely pair the fra como with the special, this spicy lobster sauce added to the savoriness and succulence of the dish.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was good. Everyone was obviously enjoying themselves and having fun conversing with their dinner partners. It definitely is cramped so if you're not comfortable with possibly getting overheard then that's something to consider. The waiter was very helpful in helping us choose our dishes and spot on in predicting when we needed his attention. \\n\\nOne downside besides the wait is the cleanliness. I had to send back our water glasses because there were oil stains all over it -- only to get a glass that was just slightly cleaner. There was also a fly that spent a good hour trying to get a closer look at our food. \\n\\nOverall, I had a wonderful time at Giacomo's and will definitely be coming back. I would actually give it 4.5 stars if Yelp had let me. Don't let that long line intimidate you.

As my girlfriend said, the location and ambiance are an A but the coffee was an F.  So where does that leave us?  A C?\\n\\nLike I said, the place is just gorgeous.  Inside was cozy and dark, outside on the giant boardwalk patio over Lake Austin was inspiring.  We got our cups on a rainy summer day and sat outside watching the turtles and giant fish peek their heads up through the rippling surface of the green water.  The shop and surrounding patio area were pretty empty, due to weather, so it was the perfect afternoon getaway; the dark haziness mixed with the slight nautical theme of the area made me reminiscent of winters spent on the Oregon coast.  Only less expensive than a plane ticket to Portland and drive to Florence.  But just barely....\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered a cup of regular coffee to find that they only offered a \\"bottomless\\" size for about $3.  She's not a heavy drinker, even when the coffee's good, so this ended up being a very expensive few sips.  The East Timon she got was both over-roasted and over-extracted; even loaded with milk I could still taste the char.\\n\\nI got my usual single cappuccino that I use to test new shops.  It was served in a coffee mug.  See, mug shape is as important to coffee as glass shape is to wine.  The crusty foam on top was chokingly thick.  Finally found coffee underneath, mostly because of the bitter feeling in my mouth.  The cap was another $3 but I get the feeling that we were paying for the location rather than the coffee.\\n\\nThey appear to have a wonderful selection of delectable desserts but if the coffee's no good, I hardly see the point.  I mean, I'm just kind of confused about the place.  If they were a bakery/hangout, it'd be perfect.  But, seeing as how they bill themselves as \\"the leading upscale roaster and brand of specialty coffee in Austin,\\" Mozart's falls short.\\n\\nSuffice it to say, though, we'll be back in the fall to watch the water and the changing leaves.

From the outside, I just figured it was your standard subs and pizza joint, but was willing to give it a try. My girlfriend had tried the pizza a couple times the week before during her lunch breaks from work and suggested that we try Scugnizzi's together. She was very impressed with the pizza, so I took her up on it the following week. However, when we entered, it was apparent to me that this was no typical neighborhood pizzeria. \\n\\nWe were met by a young gentleman in a blue button-up shirt who politely greeted and seated us next to the window. The interior was pleasant, with wooden, mahogany tables are chairs and an expected Italian feel, but nothing overly formal. Once seated, the server presented us with the menu (and wine selection!) It was at this point when I realized that there was a lot more to this place than you'd expect, seeing it from the street! \\n\\nThe wine selection was sizable and the prices appeared more than fair; My girlfriend and I selected a $29 bottle of Pinot Noir, which we very much enjoyed! At this time we also made our orders: I went with the Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken and she elected to go with the Chicken Parmesan after much deliberation. Entrees were appropriately priced for the location, with pasta dishes in the $11 - $18 range and specialty seafood dishes between $20 - $30. After a moment, our server returned with a large bottle of sparkling water and lightly toasted bread accompanied by olive oil and balsamic vinegar to prep our palates for the wine and main courses headed our way! \\n\\nAfter no more than 10-15 minutes, our orders arrived and my girlfriend's eyes popped out of her head! The Chicken Parmesan was huge and looked mouth-wateringly good. My Fettuccine Alfredo was also large in size and appeared expertly crafted. Upon our first tastes, we both shook our heads in agreement; we were going to be planning several repeat trips to Scugnizzi in the future! The Chicken Parmesan was crispy yet tender, not dry in the least, and the pasta, cheese and sauce complimented the dish perfectly. The Fettuccine was melt-in-your-mouth with it's creamy Alfredo sauce and the well-sized, tender pieces of grilled poultry which were amply distributed throughout the dish. \\n\\nOur overall impressions could not have been better, especially given my expectations going in. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic yet economic Italian dining experience!

When we tried to line up for that line, we were told it was closed.

I love that the calamari on the east coast always comes with fried peppers. This place serves one of the best calamari I have ever tasted. It was nicely coated was crispy and not oily. It comes with a marinara sauce that goes so well with it. \\n\\nSince I haven't been back in ages, I got the lobster pasta special with the Fra Diabalo sauce on their special menu. As far as I can remember, this is always on the menu and should just become a part of the regular menu. When the pasta arrived, I got this huge plate where I had half a lobster buried under a pile of pasta with mussels and clams. The only bad thing about my meal my clam shells were smashed, so I was concerned that they were broken and weren't edible. \\n\\nMy friend had the Squid Ink pasta with Swordfish and Tuna that was also on their specials. picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2u_w3rthRzR2uEihW5BC4A?select=5LkKmFM4jfawQHvz9C158A#15fdA4ABeJqYfD2qCO16_g  I had a bite of it and it was so good.

First impressions were great - Stylish contemporary decor and a warm greeting and big smile from the hostess.  Heidi was our waitress. She was friendly, attentive and accommodating.  I tried the signature blackberry sangria, which was delicious. We started with the calamari, which was lightly breaded and served with banana pepper slices and some red pepper slices, the red ones were also breaded and fried. The calamari was good, although it was oddly paired with an Asian soy and ginger based dipping sauce that would have been more appropriate for tempura shrimp.\\nI tried the tilapia imperial which is supposed to be a signature dish. The stuffing is said to be shrimp, scallops and crabmeat and it is topped with lemon caper butter.  The fish, which supposedly is delivered fresh daily tasted freezer-burned around the edges. The stuffing was a soggy flavorless mess. The capers in the lemon butter tasted like they'd been soaked in ammonia.  My wife had the blackened baja fish tacos that are served with mango salsa, lime crema and shredded lettuce. The fish wasn't really blackened. It had a dusting of reddish powder along one edge. We expected some complex flavors of Cajun spices, mango and lime. Unfortunately the tacos were bland and flavorless. At the end of the meal the manager came over and demanded we tell him specifically what we didn't like. He repeated the phrase \\"everyone loves our food\\" as if we should change our minds and send our compliments to the chef...not gonna happen. In the end he comped the calamari, ironically the only thing we enjoyed at all. In closing, if you like eating bad nursing home quality food and overpaying for it, this is the place for you.

One of our group had recommended Caruso's in Melrose to us, and the rest of us thought it was just a pizza joint. We usually go to much more elaborate (and expensive) places but we decided to give it a chance as he said the food was the real prize. Then I read some reviews about the supposed rude owner and the rude service, and I was not feeling good about our choice. But, we arrived last night, around 5:30PM and walked in to an unusually different setting, anything but elegant, but it had a certain charm as if someone really loved the place. And we ordered some drinks (we looked for a wine list, but found out that the only wine was the house wine -which by the way was terrific - so we got it). Then this nice older man (Don Michele Caruso - the owner) comes up to us with a very inviting discussion and welcomed us warmly, he then brought out a couple of plates of anti-pasto and then some fresh garden tomato's and mozzarella cheese which was fresh, and bowls of bread. We hadn't even ordered yet!!! This guy was great. \\nThen we ordered the famous Zaza pizza, Sicilian style for our 6 guests to share like an appetizer. This pizza was authentic, delicious, and came in a huge tray that allowed each of us 2 good size pieces. Then we ordered the meals. Our hardcore Italians in our group ordered the Tripe and said it was the \\"best they every had\\". They loved it, and couldn't say enough about it. 2 others (including me) had the Braciolla Plate - it was awesome - tender, tasty - and the sauce was excellent!!!! - I soaked every morsel of sauce up with the bread - AWESOME!!!. Another had the Italian Roast Pork, and loved it so much, he almost ordered seconds. Our friend who recommended the place, ordered his favorite meal - Escarole Soup, which came in what looked like a family size bowl that he finished every last bite of. \\nMr. Caruso entertained us with stories of his days in Italy, and his coming to America, how he started the business back in 1961 in Danvers Square with almost nothing in his pocket but desire to succeed. He kept telling us how he was blessed by God so many times to help him on his way. And he told us he was helped by others (including Padre Pio and his faith), and how he had helped his family and friends to set them up in business, just like others had helped him- he didn't forget the ones who helped him. At one time he had over 20 pizza places around Boston. He now focuses on his Melrose store and it works really well.\\nHe even broke out the accordian (which he hadn't played since he lost his good friend who played guitar along with him) and played us an Italian tune, to which some of our party knew the words and sang along with. Magical moments!\\nWe also had a family style HUGE salad he brought our table, and I don't think everyone's meal had a salad with it, but he treated us right.\\nAnd one of our party, also had the Calamari Salad and he is usually a lighter eater, but he finished it ALL.\\nWe finished 3 or 4 large carafe's of wine between the 6 of us as well.\\nThen came the bill.

It was once an affordable location (well Portland in general was more affordable in 2014) but if you can get it for under $200 and you want to stay in the Pearl District I recommend it. The pearl district is no longer where I'd stay (I recommend Alberta or Mississippi) but if you want to be in central 'downtown' Portland and on that side of the river than it is a great central location! Especially if it is your first time in Portland. :) *hint: you can pay $5 during certain hours each day to spend an hour at the soaking pool at Kennedy School.

We did not have a reservation but were seated promptly. The host was not welcoming at all and seemed unamused. He sat us right in the middle of the dining area which had a lot of foot traffic from the waiters and patrons. The decor was very rustic Italian and appealing which was very nice. \\nThe food- Apps: meatball with salad. To me it was a weird combination but my husband loved the meatball. Entree: salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes: my husband seemed to enjoy it despite the portion being very small. I ordered the risotto di mare, tasted great but it was almost an appetizer portion. It had one shrimp and one scallop! Desert: cannoli- it was minuscule and didn't have filling in the middle of the cannoli shell! The lemoncello cake tasted really good but it was a third of a slice with a blob of whipped cream to fill out the plate. \\nOverall I give this place 3 stars because the host was lacked any customer service skills and just showed no interest in giving us a positive dining experience. The food tasted just good. The portions were way too small. We've dined in other participating Dine Out Boston restaurants and we've always had regular sized portions so we're extremely disappointed with Antico Forno's tactic to decrease portion sizes. My recommendation, if you eat bird sized portions and could care less about being greeted properly and welcomed into a restaurant, this is a good place to have a bite.

A lot of it is probably the convenience of living nearby, but in an area with plenty of restaurants to walk to, we continue to frequent Row 34 because of the food!\\n\\nWe've had generally good service, too, with only two of our visits being sub-par. Most of the staff is very nice, attentive, and willing to answer any questions you may have. The hosts are usually very welcoming and friendly, but I'd recommend making a reservation or going early, as it's nearly impossible to get in during peak times if you just stop in looking for a table.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pretty dark in the evening (I prefer eating there in the daylight) and standard for modern mid-to-upscale-priced eateries, with industrial touches that make the restaurant feel cozy and a crowd large enough to know that it's on-trend at the moment. While it's a casual dining place, I've definitely felt dressed down at times when ducking in for a bite in more casual clothing. The prices are on-par with most nicer restaurants, but hardly obscene. They've got a solid beer (bottled and draft) and wine selection, too, with some unique selections. Also, the outdoor area is really nice, despite the road noise from the busy intersection. They keep the patio heated for cooler days, as well, so don't be afraid to take the outdoor seating if it's available.\\n\\nAs for the food, we're obsessed with their warm buttered lobster rolls. So far, one of the best - if not THE best - lobster rolls we've had since moving to the area. The creamy lobster roll is good, too, but the buttered one has since won me over. The side of chips are fine, but I'd recommend going for their 242 fries instead. They're a thicker cut of fries and they're awesome! We've had the tuna tartare, which was excellent, as well as the Old Bay onion rings, which were more like a large ramekin of fried onions that you'd apply to a burger than a normal onion ring. This is NOT a complaint, though. They're delicious, but more fork-ready than your traditional finger food. We've also downed countless oysters at Row 34. The oysters are always very fresh, with a nice, constantly-changing selection from which to explore.\\n\\nOverall, it's fairly safe to say that Row 34 won't disappoint on the food side of the house, but the crowd could be a bit much for those looking for a more relaxed atmosphere, the wait can be absurd without reservations, and there's always a chance you could end up with a disinterested server.

Dark painted wall with murals and artwork. \\n Kind'a walking inside a museum of unusual things or a set design from American Horror Story.  We never stayed in a hotel with a shared bathroom before and I didn't like having to go outside the room into a dark hallway; although the bathroom was just adjacent from our room, I woke my husband up to stand outside the bathroom while I do my business.  The place felt haunted and I got chills.  I think their goal was to stand out by different from other hotels but all those gypsy themed decor gave me a restless sleep.  From my understanding they hired a celebrity interior designer to work on this building but painting the bedroom walls deep red was not ideal when guests long for a good night and restful sleep.  She probably missed attending Theory of Color in her Interior Design class. The air conditioning was loud and we complained about it to the manager.

The first time I went was wiht my parents during the Christmas holiday. Although we sampled a variety of offal/non-meat-based appetizers and each tried a different entree, all three of us left feeling underwhelmed. Although expensive, the dishes we sampled lacked innovative preparation and complex flavor. It seemed the kitchen was relying on their use of unorthodox pig (and chicken and cow...) parts to spice up the cuisine, when, in reality, all these ingredients made for was a foodie-sounding menu. Service was so-so, and was certainly nothing to write home about. \\n\\nFast forward almost a year: after reading numerous articles lauding Craigie's brunch, kitchen, bar, and especially their burger, I was ready to give the restaurant another chance. After all, maybe they were just having an off night. We made a reservation a week and a half in advance, but when we arrived, our table wasn't yet ready and we were herded to the bar for a 40-minute wait. Fine- I've worked in restaurants for five years. I get that tables don't always turn when you want them to.  Forty minutes behind on a reservation in a highly celebrated restaurant with no comp was, however, a little unexpected. \\n\\nWe enjoined our cocktails at the bar and, after our wait, were finally seated at a nice table by the window. After a couple minutes our server arrived and we asked if the burger was still available and we could get it at a table (instead of in the bar). She said she'd check, then walked away. Returning several minutes later with a tray, she wordlessly began stacking the contents of our table atop it. As she pivoted to walk (ostensibly) to the bar, I said something to the effect of \\"so can we get the burger?\\" A little put-off, she responded with a \\"no\\" and that it \\"had been sold out for hours,\\" but she thought we wanted to sit in the bar anyway and thus was taking us there. Arbitrarily.      ... I appreciate the proactive attitude, but not asking guests what they wanted to do, silently and inexplicably clearing their table, and generally adopting an attitude of annoyance really left a sour taste in our mouths. \\n\\nAfter the table location confusion, we ordered a nice bottle of wine and settled into our booth (not at the bar). I ordered the roast chicken, while my boyfriend ordered a rabbit dish. We also split an assortment of pates and cured meats as well as the duck fat brussels sprouts with dinner. The pates were pretty standard fare, but were served with a variety of interesting sauces, mustards, and compotes which really made the dish something special. The duck fat brussels sprouts were as rich as expected- they had a great char and nuttiness that made them truly addictive. Our entrees were, unfortunately, rather a disappointment. Although my chicken was moist, it tasted like something I could have made at home. My boyfriend found his rabbit similarly underwhelming. \\n\\nAfter two attempts at Craigie, I still can't figure out what makes this place such a favorite for (what seems like) the rest of Boston. That said, I've yet to try the burger or brunch--both of which have quite venerable reputations of their own. Whether or not those accolades are to be trusted, though, is something yet to be seen."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went here again a couple nights ago and pretty much solidified my initial impressions of the place.\\n\\nThe food is pretty damn tasty, namely the cured meats, the stone ground mustard, and the thin crust pizza.

They gave us a table by the window, so we had a nice view overlooking the boats towards the Boston skyline as we dined.\\n\\nTheir bread was great and was served with a nice hummus.  The entrees are well portioned, but their appetizers were generally light for the price.\\n\\nTheir Crispy Calamari tossed with Thai chili cilantro glaze & banana peppers $14 was my favorite appetizer.

The Rolled Eggplant roasted peppers, boursin cheese, basil, spinach, tomato sauce $11 and the Roasted Red Beet Salad baby arugula, candied pecans, ricotta salata, balsamic $14 were both tasty, but rather ordinary.\\n\\nAs for entrees, the Short Rib Pasta braised short ribs, pappardelle pasta, roasted tomato, parmesan $24 had a good amount of meat in it and was well flavored with al dente pasta.  But another DC's special of the day (a fish with string beans, mashed potatoes and lobster for $30) did her in, so she ended up taking perhaps a third of it home.

Although the protein was seasoned well, it was a little over-cooked for me. I usually like my steak medium rare, but it was 5 degrees more than how I like it.

They upgraded our desserts and I got a creme brulee. The dessert was the highlight of the meal because I love creme brulee! That might not be a good thing because after all, this is a steak house!

There were three stuffed pieces of eggplant smothered in tomato sauce (and may I say, YUM!) as well as three layers of fat sliced tomatoes and mozzarella on the caprese plate.\\n\\nAs for the pasta, the sauce was infused with flavors of the seafood.  Too peppery for my dc.  A bit too salty too.\\n\\nThe pizza surprised us by arriving sauceless.  The complete coating of cheese did not lend it enough flavor in my dc's opinion, but I found the gobs of pre-cooked spinach rather wet - but that sure did the job of keeping the spinach leaves from burning!  But it also lent to a slight sogginess in the center.  The crust was a bit crisp at the edge but rather soft in the center.\\n\\nThe place was pretty full shortly before 1pm, so they must do pretty good lunch business.\\n\\n*** RW Lunch 3/2017 ***\\n\\nWhat do you do when your lunch plans fall through last minute?  If it is during Dine Out Boston, you pick a restaurant and go!\\n\\nThere were only a few parties already seated when I arrived shortly after their 11:30am opening.  As a solo diner, I was first offered the high top in the back (I don't like high tops), then the two top by the hostess stand (and the front door).  Yes, it wasn't ideal being made to feel like a 2nd class citizen after your prescheduled lunch plans went awry, but their third offering was fine.\\n\\nI noticed that they had scattered their patrons about the room, which I appreciated, since that would allow their guests to feel like they had some sense of privacy and space till the room filled up.\\n\\nBoth the lunch menu and Restaurant Week menu were presented to me, along with a wine menu.  Bread was room temperature, but tasty served with a vessel of oil for the pouring.\\n\\nFor $20, I enjoyed 3 courses within an hour.  It was Dine Out Boston, however, so I was not entirely surprised at the portions presented.  As a meal consisting of 3 courses, it was sufficient for my luncheon appetite.  But if I had been ordering a la carte off their regular lunch time menu, I would have been less than satisfied for price.  For instance, I noticed an order of Arancini passing by with but one ball on the plate.  This is priced at $12 on the lunch menu, which presumably is for more balls per order.\\n\\nThe Caprese (Fresh mozzarella and tomatoes salad, dressed with extra virgin oil and basil) ($10 lunch menu) arrived with twin tiers of red and white, while an older posted photo of mine shows a caprese consisting of 3 tiers.  The ingredients were fresh and the salad refreshing.  Nice and simple does the trick sometimes!\\n\\nThe Salmone (Salmon filet baked in the oven, saute spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, mustard crab meat crust, citrus reduction) was a narrow yet thick (about an inch perhaps) a cut, just a tad overcooked, but still satisfactory.  The crisp undersurface of the fish contrasted well with the moist crab meat topping.  The flavors were bold and the sides accompanied the protein well and filled out the dish.\\n\\nThe Lemoncello was an oddly sliced portion, hinting at what was missing (that being the tip of the cake).  But it was a nice light, creamy lemony ending.\\n\\nThe longest lull between courses was oddly after the entree - odd since dessert was just a piece of cake with some whipped cream and part of a berry - 13 min.\\n\\nThe bathroom (single person unisex) was chilly.

The clam strips felt like they were full of sand. I tried a different strip to see if it was a fluke. No such luck. The salmon was overly smoked and also not worth eating. We left hungry.

The Maf√© is really not to be missed - the lamb meat falls off the bone (yes, there are bones in the dish, but it's hard to mind picking around them because it's clear this is where some of the flavor comes from!) and the sauce is rich and delicious. The appetizers, however, were less memorable. We had the spring rolls (Nems) and something else that was fried... Both were crispy and crunchy but not especially flavorful, even with the accompanying sauce. (My go-to for killer spring rolls is the Rouleaux at Elephant Walk down the street). We also had a side of the plantains, which were again crunchy but unimpressive (I recommend the Maracucitos at Orinoco for an incredible plantain experience!).\\n\\nTo drink, we had some enjoyable red wine. We inquired about the African sake which is an ingredient in a few of the cocktails, but our server was not able to offer us a taste because all of the cocktails are already mixed by dinner service time.

Don't come here if you're looking for a thick meaty sandwich, but if you are a veggies-and-hummus type or can at least stand some greens with your chicken, you'll leave pleased.

The food is so authentic, servers are quick and efficient and you are served in a timely manner, even for how busy they always are. One thing to be mindful of is that they are very busy on weekends and their entrance (a few chairs) does make it challenging to wait as it is not a comfortable place to sit. You are clearly in the way of serving staff and at times they do make it very clear you are in the way, which can be frustrating for both guests and staff. It's a lot easier in summer when you can wait outside, more room to move, warmer weather, but on chilly nights, it's not the most ideal.

My future MIL had a glass of wine that ended up spilling because the table was pretty wobbly. I've worked in fine dining..

I've never had paella anywhere, but it tasted like less spicy jambalaya to me. She said it's not authentic (she's lived in Spain). While we were eating the paella, 2 servers ran into each other & 1 just happened to be holding 2 glasses of wine on a tray. This happened right behind my fianc√©, so he got splashed with wine again.

As such, I probably missed the long lines / hectic crowds and ordering system that others might have experienced.  Without the long lines, it was relatively easy for me to order and pick up my food.  Flour has a nice, warm wood feel to it contrasted by the dark blue walls in the kitchen area.  There were probably room for 40 people to sit.\\n\\nFood:  as disclosed at the top, I ordered the famous sticky bun (with dark, sticky caramel and toasted pecans)($3.75) and better yet, literally came fresh out of the oven; when I ordered the waiter had to check if they were ready and luckily they were!  Now I get why it got a hype after the Throwdown with Bobby Flay.  Having come out of the oven and 30 min later when I got back to my hotel room after taking it to-go, the pastry was still a bit soft and chewy but nicely brown and slightly crisp on the outside. Thank god for the toasted pecans to add a much-need crunchiness to the chewy, sticky texture.  The caramel is awesome, especially after being slightly warm- it almost has a dark, rich molasses flavor to it and so adds a depth of flavor (other caramels can tend to be a bit too sweet if that makes sense).  Be prepared to enter a food coma or develop a 4-month food baby after eating one of these; it is a lot of pastry with a huge dollop of caramel and so I barely was able to finish mine.  \\n\\nMy great experience is most likely because I came in right when it opened in the morning and when everything was freshly baked, hence the 4 stars.

Of course I didn't take notes, so some of this review is going to lack specifics.  \\n\\nI hate hot/spicy foods, yet want my palate challenged with flavor.  This place does exactly that.  \\n\\nOne staple of Cuban culture is a diet of plantains, which are essentially versatile bananas.  Hey someone should name their band that!  I can see it now, ladies and gentlemen, live from Havana Cuba we welcome to the stage Versatile Bananas!\\n\\nPlantains are prepared to be both sweet, savory and starchy.  One menu item tastes like a syrupy sweet dish almost like a nibble of Bananas Foster.  Another is similar to a salty french fry.    \\n\\nThe flavors of every item are as if you had been watching a black and white television for most of your life and then one day Dad brings home a color television.  Or for the younger crowd, playing a Pong game on your television and then given a PlayStation.  \\n\\nOne happy hour item was so amazing that our waitress brought us over a Radio Cab note with the name on it.  \\"Masitas\\" were marinated pork bites that are so juicy.  I am not entirely sure how the marinade works, but the texture tastes like they may have been lightly deep fried or something.   \\n\\nThe desserts are wonderfully tasty and creative:  Cookies.  A chocolate cigar (which for some reason no one considers un-PC).  I enjoyed a cake that sported the interesting flavor combination of dark chocolate with passion fruit.  The passion fruit bursts through the moist cake and dark chocolate leaving your pallet wondering what the heck just happened.  \\n\\nYes indeed, Pambiche is a place worthy of coming back to again and again.  It is great to take a date before a movie at the Laurelhurst Theater, about a block away. \\n\\nOne drawback is the seating is in very close quarters, so it is not very date friendly.  The menu will impress your date but the close quarters with the other patrons give you intimacy with everyone else besides your date!  \\n\\nSometimes the wait takes a while too, and you find yourself on the street outside for ten to fifteen minutes.  Good things are worth the wait, however.  \\n\\nFor the more adventurous, they also have outdoor seating with heaters.  Those seats are assigned also, so it doesn't necessarily speed the check in process.  I don't believe they take phone reservations so you need to put your name on a sign up sheet when you arrive.  \\n\\nI have also enjoyed breakfast there, and the highlight of that visit was the assorted sweet breads.\\n\\nPambiche is located on the corner of N.E. 28th and Glisan."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"First of all---cash only, but they do have ATM's everywhere handy.

So im giving Olive Garden three stars because I felt like I really only reserve four stars for places that are AMAZING. But in all honesty my experience here last night deserved four. \\n\\nI went in with pretty low expectations. I had a gift card and hadn't been to an Olive Garden in probably six years because I always remembered it being so salty and giving me awful stomach pains [I just kept thinking it would be like my recent Applebees experience...see review]. \\n\\nWe did call ahead seating because I also remember waiting hours to sit down. So we called ahead, and were told it would be 20-30 minutes. That was a pleasant surprise for 7pm on a Friday night. We got there, ordered some drinks at the bar, and after five minutes we were taken to our table. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was that our waitress was SUPER nice, and not in an overbearing way, just genuinely nice. At the same time I felt very rushed to make my decision. Listen, I haven't been here in years, give me a few minutes to look at what you guys have! She did give us sufficient time though, so I didnt mind too much. I ordered the chicken and gnocchi soup, and the four cheese ziti pasta. My boyfriend had the shrimp mezzaluna and the same soup as me. \\n\\nI guess I'm used to going to places where they actually cook all the food from scratch in house, because we got our soup and breadsticks within literally two minutes of ordering it. I didn't mind, but everything felt so systematic. However, the soup was really good. I was genuinely interested in how good it was, and that was a nice surprise. I would definitely order that again. The breadsticks were also decent, not as good as Villa Nova, but I didn't expect the world and dipping them in the soup was definitely yum. \\n\\nOur waitress came over to apologize after about 10 minutes because she said the meal was taking a bit longer. I really didn't feel like it was long at all. I like waiting and being able to enjoy the environment, conversation, and whatnot. \\n\\nOur food still came out super fast. It was piping hot and quite honestly, it was delicious. My boyfriends shrimps weren't fishy in the least, they tasted really good. My pasta was cheesey and flavorful, and neither seemed overly salty. We both finished our entrees and didn't feel so stuffed that we couldn't breathe, both were perfectly satisfied. And that says a lot, because most of these sorts of restaurants leave me saying my signature phrase \\"it feels like knives!\\"\\n\\nI do admit that I feel like with Olive Garden's resources they should offer whole wheat pasta and some less sodium laden options, but if you only go there every once in awhile it really is a nice experience, and I definitely don't feel disgusting today [and I am a hardcore health nut, in every sense of the phrase.]\\n\\nWill I go there again anytime soon, probably not, but I definitely understand why people enjoy this place."},{"name":"Chilli Duck Thai Cuisine","address":"829 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"**STARS: 3.5**\\n\\nCame in for lunch with the boss during our stay here and it was ok...

The biggest disappointments, though, were the limp, room temperature Caesar salads. To add insult to injury, the salads were also severely lacking in the dressing department...don't even know about the flavor enough to be able to comment on it. I totally understand the faux pas of an over-dressed salad, but these salads maybe had 1/2 teaspoon of dressing each...not exaggerating. In fact, I'm probably being generous saying 1/2 teaspoon each. I could only find dressing on two small pieces of lettuce that were underneath at the complete bottom of the bowl. Even my husband, who prefers a very lightly dressed salad, wondered if there was any dressing! Waitress disappeared until the bill was delivered so we never had a chance to ask for more dressing or mention that the lettuce was limp and room temp. At $10.99 per warm, limp, undressed salad, I'd much rather go to Bertucci's and get a bigger and tastier Caesar salad for $7.99. \\n\\nHoping one of the other waterside restaurants has a better Caesar salad game. Not too much to ask, right? I mean, if you can't get the basics of a salad right, how good can the rest of the food be? \\n\\nI worried all night that I might get an upset stomach or worse, food poisoning, from the warm salad...probably a good thing there wasn't any dressing after all.

Or would it be the other guy who inhaled his food in three seconds? No, actually, in a twist ending, it was tie. A tie of epic proportions between the girl and the guy who who dip the chicken in the broth, put the whole thing in their mouth to knaw the meat off the bone, then spit the bone out. Onto the table. Let me reiterate: they put food in their mouths, chewed it, then spat out the bone ONTO THE TABLE, making a little pile of bone oozing in broth and spit.\\n\\nAfter they were declared the victor of the gross out contest, the remaining staff finished their meals and cleared the table...

Excellent service.  Valet parking better than garage."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"After reading my review of a less than stellar first visit, Chef Maws personally invited us back to redo the tasting menu. I will commend the service at Craigie upfront. For instance, my date and I were given individual wine and beer pairings, respectively, after I briefly mentioned that I was more of a beer person. You are definitely pampered by the service staff-not to the overwhelming level of classic French restaurants, but still top-notch.\\nWe were started off with a nice citrus-flavored aperitif with the faintest hint of licorice. Then came a basket of *warm* bread followed by a fish trio amuse. The sashimi with horseradish and roe was fantastic. The horseradish added zest without overpowering the sweetness of the fish, and the briny pop of the roe added a nice textual contrast. The two smoked fish rillettes were forgettable. My date noted that they were seasoned with similar spices, muddling their individual flavors and the flavors of the fish-also, one of them had a texture reminiscent of canned tuna, which wasn't too pleasing. \\nA Riesling accompanied our next course, kampachi sashimi with citrus, mustard seed, and pine nuts. The mustard seed and citrus paired well with the sashimi and the pine nuts added a more unctuous earthy note that brought everything together-excellent. We were then given champagne with a lightly poached salmon with clam and Iberico ham. This was the highlight of the meal-the fish was velvety in texture and accompanied by salty, paper-thin bits of ham, and a buttery shellfish bisque tied everything together nicely.\\nNext was farro pasta with mushroom and tripe ragu and shaved truffles. I enjoyed the flavor and texture of the pasta, but the truffles added little earthiness to the sauce. I'm a fan of offal, particularly the texture of slow-braised tripe. Unfortunately the tripe was cut into such small pieces that all of its spongy gelatinous texture was lost-this seemed like an offal dish for the offal-averse. The accompanying champagne, which went great with the previous course, was ill-matched.\\nOur next course was cotechino with lentils topped by a runny egg and foie gras foam. This was paired with a Belgian IPA and white wine for my date. I get fried eggs on my burger so this dish really spoke to me-unfortunately it looked better than it tasted. The runny yoke combined with the lentils to make a great sauce with a nice texture, but the flavor of the cotechino was mostly lost unless eaten by itself. Like the truffle shavings in the previous dish, the foie gras foam added little flavor to the dish and seemed contrived. The beer paired well and the hoppiness helped cut the richness of the egg and lentils.\\nRebounding from the cotechino was two giant halves of roasted marrow bones topped with pastrami. The unctuous marrow on perfectly crusty pieces of bread was given a nice textual and flavor kick by flakes of sea salt and cut by the bitterness of the beer. While I love both marrow and pastrami, the combination was approaching fatty overkill and I would've appreciated a little acid-perhaps the standard parsley salad? Our final savory course was a trio of duck: roasted breast, seared foie with grapes, and homemade sausage. These preparations were accompanied by a farmyardy red that was bold and flavorful by itself and paired well with the duck. The slices of breast were decent, but the fat could have been rendered a little more and one of the slices was a little sinewy. My date extoled the seared foie, which was beautifully caramelized and matched well with tender juicy grapes, as the high point of the meal. Unfortunately, the duck sausage did not have any semblance of duck flavor but instead had an unpleasantly mealy texture that made us give up on it. \\nThe first dessert was a panna cotta with pomegranate jam and ginger gremolata. The panna cotta had a wonderful texture and the hint of ginger was really exciting. Then came a bittersweet chocolate mousse tart and white chocolate ice cream and caramel and jam-filled beignets with a creme anglaise dipping sauce. The chocolate tart was paired with a great imperial stout and the beignets were paired with a much-too-sweet dessert wine. The tart and ice cream were good, nothing special. Much to my dismay, the beignets were dense and cakey and not at all reminiscent of the light, pillowy beignets I've had previously. \\nOur second Craigie experience was better than our first. Unfortunately, the highs of the night were weighed down by a few lows. I can't say if we were left unimpressed because we were expecting the kitchen to wow us with every course or because we just had a spectacular meal at The Breslin last week. While we appreciate the generosity of the restaurant (the comped meal came to $400 before tip), we were still left underwhelmed. There were definitely standout dishes on both visits, but there were simply too make 'just ok' dishes and dishes that missed the mark that could not be overlooked, especially to justify the price."},{"name":"Pizza A Go Go","address":"3240 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The pizza here is fine, not good or bad.

This dish alone is worth the trip to Luce.  Somehow the chef has managed to create a succulent gem with delicate braised morsels of the namesake mollusk in a potato / olives / parsley mixture. It is a truly amazing dish that is perfectly balanced.  My main plate was the 'Papardelled w/ Rabbit'.

We decided to stay and give it a shot they were offering hamburgers, hot dogs, crab legs, grilled lobster tails and ribs as well as two sides. I selected the hamburger with corn on the cob and potato salad. Now I love hamburgers.... and I'm thinking at this point that this burger is about to be amazing since it was $15. What came out was ok....it was a regular burger that you would get at a cookout. The corn was a third...possibly a forth of a whole corn on the cob and the potato salad  was actually decent. My friend ordered the lobster tails. They tasted pretty good but were a little salty. I was expecting this place to be in top notch condition, but when I used the ladies room, the surroundings were less than I expected from a place with a known celebrities name attached. A couple things that I did enjoy though were the hookah, and the Hennessy, green tea and agave drink....as well as our waitress...those three things got this place to the three stars.

The overall waffle was tiny, dense, and chewy, while the inside had a buttery taste. Bacon caramel was rich and intense, and there's no mistake that it tastes just like bacon! Great addition to the already yummy waffle. Cafe latte was also enjoyable. It was smooth and did not taste sour or bitter at all. I did not try the Paella, so no comment.\\n\\nOverall, I'm so glad I ended up at Chambar instead of Jam Cafe. The food was excellent and the service was great too.

First of all I think we have to separate a few things about the experience from the actual food, to the actual physical appearance of the restaurant and the cause that Lola is championing.  First the most important is the food.  It is above average, it 's arguably the best dirty rice I have eaten but beware that it is very rich (I like that)  The fish was well made, the cabbage was good but with mostly mixed in with the rest of the food.  The Cajun tea was terrific.  The gumbo had good flavor but sadly not Andouille sausage, I think it was just sausage.  Serving it in a small pot did not really add to the novelty as it made it hard to eat with a broken Chinese soup spoon.  , My daughter loved her take on the crawfish ettoufee that is not creamy.  My college sophomore son and his friends just raved about her food and the eclecticness of the place (good or bad? Take your pick)  Price wise, it is moderately priced with good portions.  Overall the food alone was a 3-4 stars.  The ambiance and the setting is the most polarizing as adults think could be charming bordering on disturbing with the freezer and fridge in the dining area with the mopping bucket visible.  My wife was looking for the State Health inspection permit.  Like I mentioned my kids 19 and 16 and other 19 year old just loved the place.  It is the quintessential dive.

Let's say even as simple as a miso soup, price is $2.50 (at least a dollar more than regular) but it is the tastiest I've ever had! Also the presentation of the dishes really got my two thumbs up.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great idea, especially with their unique fillings and the ability to mix and match, but I don't see myself coming here all that often. I tried 2 bao and the truffle tots during my visit. Actually make that 3 bao because I had a bite of the Nutella bao too. Of the 2 savory bao, I preferred the pork belly, although I think the pork belly bao at Baoery is better. The grouper had too much sauce which I felt overwhelmed the fish. The tots were good but didn't have much truffle flavor or any chives that I could see. The Nutella bao was amazing, but really how can you go wrong with Nutella and bananas on anything? A problem I foresee is that King Bao doesn't have much seating and I don't think bao are very good take out items as they'll get cold and dry too quickly.

First, we were said \\"hi\\", since not really greeted, by 4-5 immature, impolite, and customer service lacking young hostesses collected at the reception booth.  We were asked to wait while a table was cleaned and specifically asked them to please make sure to clean underneath the table (since so many places clean tables by throwing the food on the floor). After about 15 min of waiting, even though the place was mostly empty, we were seated at, you guessed it, a table that was filthy underneath including two of the chairs.  I asked one of the hostess if we could move from table to one of the many available, to which she, without even apologizing, said no that other tables were reserved and could only ask to get table cleaned.  Given her attitude and the fact that we didn't want to stand there like idiots holding two kids after we had already waited 15 min and specifically asked for a clean area, we asked to speak to the manager.  He  simply and unapologetically showed no care for the condition of the restaurant's cleanliness given the condition of the floor at, not only the table, but the surrounding area.  Clearly, he is ok with unsanitary conditions and I would hope they are looked at closely during sanitation inspections.  I wish I could remember his name to add here, but he definitely should step down and allow a more qualified individual to have his job.  Our server was very nice and polite.  Food, while not a 10 under \\"Mexican food\\" since this place is more Tex-Mex, was pretty good, except the rice and beans which tasted like they came from a microwaveable TV dinner or Lipton packet, but in all fairness, this is common at Tex-Mex establishments.  Only thing our server should have been better at is retrieving our plates from table... we left and there were still food plates not retrieved, even after we had dessert.

We ordered the hush puppies, Cajun fries, shrimp, blue crab, snow crab, sausage and green mussels which comes with corn and potato. The Cajun fries were the bomb. Everything else was a bit on the salty side and almost inedible. The potatoes were the saving grace from the salt. However, the corn was mushy and just not good.

The desserts can be pretty tempting and delicious, but often times they are left out for way too long. Not worth it in my opinion. \\n\\nOther downsides that have been previously mentioned: it can get over crowded, parking usually sucks unless you come during an odd hour, the wireless is often inconsistent.

Then when ordering, I was last cause I couldn't choose - the pizza didn't seem special and the pasta was uninspiring - and she seemed annoyed I was taking too long.

I love deviled eggs and really enjoyed the smokiness of the deviled eggs at Estelle's, which is a nice change from the tart bite you would expect. The eggs were fresh, the filling was creamy and tasty, and the portion was reasonable for the price. The dish was also room temperature, which (to a former server) shows that the eggs weren't just pre-filled in the morning and sitting in a fridge somewhere all day. I thought the hushpuppies were ok, but being a New Englander I'm not the best judge. My (Southern-ish) friend felt that they were a bit gummy inside. Regardless, they had a good, meaty flavor due to the inclusion of the ham, the dipping sauce was sweet and delicious, and the portion was a good size. \\n\\nAs for entrees, I had the cajun cornmeal crusted catfish, which I thought was excellent. The catfish had a lovely, crispy crust that was a great compliment to the tender fish inside, which was fresh and well-cooked. I found the rice and beans to have good flavor but felt they pretty standard. However, I absolutely love the way the greens are cooked at Estelle's (they seem to be the same greens served with the fried chicken); they are perfectly wilted and not at all bitter with a flavor as if they're cooked in drippings. Love. My friend had the fried chicken which he raved about; I tried it and loved it as well. The chicken dish was comprised of a juicy breast and large drumstick coated with a flavorful and crispy breading. The bacon (thick-cut, more like pancetta) is a great addition to the enormous side of gooey mac and cheese. Again, I found the greens to be delicious. \\n\\nDuring our second visit we shared the gumbo to start, which I found to be just ok. It was hearty and full of rice and protein, but it wasn't as flavorful as I had anticipated. After dreaming of Estelle's fried chicken for weeks, we both ordered it this time around, but we weren't as impressed as we had been the first time. The breading was not as crisp as it had been and the chicken was overall quite greasy. The greens and mac and cheese were again delicious, and the chicken, despite the setbacks mentioned, was still good. This dish will leave you absolutely stuffed, and being the cheapest entree on the menu, it's certainly a great value. \\n\\nOur service was wonderful both times we visited. During our first visit we were told that all of the tables were full (which is to be expected around 8PM on a weekend) but were offered two seats at a counter in the window, which we probably would have preferred to a traditional table anyway. Our server was very sweet and knowledgable about the beer offerings - which is impressive given the enormous selection. The second time we dined we headed over during the week after work, probably around 7 or so, and the restaurant was not busy at all; the poor bouncer's job had morphed to doorman, and most of the tables were empty, as was the bar. We sat at the bar and had a lovely bartender/server who was quick to give us a taste of her favorite beer when I was unsure of what to pair with my dinner. The restaurant itself is decorated minimally, but it's still welcoming and comfortable. \\n\\nOverall, we've enjoyed the good food, amazing beer selection, and excellent service that Estelle's has to offer. I'm sure I'll be back."},{"name":"SOHO Restaurant","address":"4300 Paces Ferry Rd SE, Ste 107","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Loved the Martinis, calamari, spinach salad, fish, creme brule, and the menu in general.

Finally, it was a birthday celebration, and we were never even asked if we wanted dessert... After plates were cleared, we were just handed checks about 20 mins later.

The ripe plantains that it came with were fantastic as well - however the salad (although beautiful and overflowing with avocado) felt sort of tacked on, and the rice could've been left off as well as it had little flavor. The sangria was fantastic as well as the red snapper which someone else at the table ordered. Then for dessert we ordered the mango cheesecake which did not taste like mango per se but it did seem to have mango in it as the texture was a bit different and there was another flavor present, despite not living up to its namesake the cheesecake was very good as well.

The owner, Scott Roberts, is a great owner and really cares about his food and you can tell. The cole slaw is my favorite side dish and if you've not exploded the elastic seams on your pants, you NEED to try their peach/blackberry cobbler a la mode. It's some of the best homemade goodness you can expect in a bowl that can totally be shared by 2-3 people. It is CASH ONLY and BYOB in coolers is also allowed so that's a (+) if you want an alcoholic beverage with your BBQ. Our family comes here every time they come in to town too.  It's the best!!

Let's start with, if you are looking for a nice, restaurant that says its cajun food and feel like paying for over priced food then go to Pappadeaux's..If you are looking for some down home, cajun/soul food, made with love and made just for you, then this is the place.  It is small, it will take a minute to get your food but justsit back and take the place in.  Lola has made this place so warm and comforting that I felt like I had walked into my grandmother's house.  Lola came and sat down, apologized for not having a few items because she had just come from feeding a group of homless people but was willing to give us everything she had.  We ordered: Jambalaya, Etouffe, Chicken the sides: cabbage, red beans and rice, green beans and cornbread.  Lola brought our drinks and went to the kitchen to cook our food.  All the food was to die for, we didn't know what to eat first and we definately ate off of each other's plates.  We talked to the other \\"newbies\\" trying the place out, who also took to ordering a few plates and sharing.  We all were so amazed at how good it was and how Lola treated us like we had just come home.  The small TV was on with a Christmas classic \\"Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer\\" and that was it, I was going down memory lane. \\n\\nNot only does Lola serve up some comfort food, she does so much for the city of Austin.  She takes her time and money that is given through donations, and takes the food to the streets to feed the homeless and has the homeless to her restaurant to feed them.  So go if you want some great food made with love that will hit the spot and keep you coming back for more, then go visit Lola and while you're there, give her a little extra to help out or sign up to volunteer to come help her.  A little bit goes a long way! \\n\\nOh and before we left, she gave us her phone number so that if we ever came by and she wasn't there we could call her and she would come feed us. WHO DOES THAT?

Yes the food is amazing and great but atomosphere and staff is a huge point system in my book. When my husband and I walked in we were dressed causual they looked at us like we were trash. They asked the people before us if they wanted to check their coats. Never asked us and yes it is Portland people and November we had coats as well. \\n\\n  The service was slow and our waitress was sick and coughing all over the place. As I was ordering she excused herself because she had a \\"tickle\\". I never saw her once was her hands after she coughed in them.

Please note he was also the one that didn't ask us to take our coats but the person before and after us. Why didn't he send her home. It is gross to be working in a food industry coughing into hands and excusing yourself because your coughing all over the place.

So why keep one that's spreading her germs all around and making the dinning experience horrible for the guests? Not good not classy.\\n\\n  Second my miso soup didn't come with a spoon. So I asked for a spoon. I then got a lecture that it is traditional that they don't eat it with a spoon. Before he gave me the spoon I asked for he said try it out of the bowl first. Holding my spoon at ransom I really had no choice right? Standing there with my spoon and waiting for me to take a sip from the soup the way he wanted me to and I did.

We loved the idea of sitting on the nice big patio in a prime people watching stretch of Inman Park, but it was just disgustingly hot, so we opted for the inside.  After being completely ignored by the girl who was supposed to be our server, another server saw that we hadn't been helped and proceeded to be really helpful the rest of the night, even making a little jab at how \\"dippy\\" some of the other waiters were (this I thought was pretty funny/appreciated.)\\n\\nFirst, the patio looks great for a night that's not too insanely hot.  The inside space is a little too self-conscious for me in terms of its architecture and decor - it's kind of a weird mix of hip Inman Park industrial and roadside cantina and ends up missing the mark a bit on both accounts.  \\n\\nAs for drinks, the margaritas are a bit expensive, but they do offer Skinny Margaritas and bunch of other variations that all vary a bit in price.  And I had a nice glass of white wine for $5 and they have Black Label beer for $1.95, so drinking for cheap is possible here.\\n\\nAlso, the chips are way better here than at Across the street.\\n\\nBut beyond that, the food was solidly mediocre.  My husband's fish tacos were far from the best we'd ever had, but they were basically fine I guess.  I had some chicken and cheese enchiladas that were tasty, but were REALLY crazy covered in cheese, like, to the point that it was even a bit excessive for ME (which says something.)

Neither of our dishes were anything remotely approaching health food, neither in preparation nor in quality.  And it's certainly not \\"pure\\" in terms of being authentic Mexican food.

If you could automatically order their tasty treats without a staff member, then I'd give 4 stars.

A small group of locals, keeping their distance, gathered near the corner of Kossuth and Mohawk Streets to catch a glimpse of the steel plated 341model Cadillac as it putted towards on the cobblestone and parked. The chrome of its bumper, headlights, and exquisite ornament glittered like tiny stars in the hot afternoon sun; its green paint job kept perfect and clean impressed the group--giving undue credence for blood money turned status symbol. \\n\\nThere was no air conditioning in the 1930s, and the long drive on the national road from the bootleg dealings to HQ was unbearable after an hour or two. Here was midway. The underground figure stumbled out of the car; the Italian suit that hung on his heavy frame was soaked with moisture, his banded fedora spotted with sweat. He pushed back his doorman who tried to help, abuse was part of his job. A welcome party of flappers in fur, suit adore conmen, and a regal Madam, feigning cordiality to hide their nerves, meet him with measured charm. They entered the Cafe there, the Mohawk, which was then a speakeasy, a house of ill-repute.  Licentiousness can cool the toxic desires if not the physical body; perhaps it was the summer before Ness clicked the cuffs. \\n\\nIt is not factually known if Al Capone visited the Mohawk, though it is easy to imagine he did as I have. After all the Old Mohawk dates that far back, and was a speakeasy and brothel. The joint retains much of that charm, siting in among the residences in the brick store with its red canopy, large front window, and 1920s streetlight held by a ivory arm and hand. The entrance itself is old and wooden, emanating its charm the first step in. The place has decent spacing. It is a restaurant more than a bar, with tables scattered under expose brick. They play up it historic past; with wall decor of vintage photos and items, in among modern flare. It does have a sizable bar.   \\n\\nIt is not my favorite place in the area though, which is not really a negative considering its local competition. I've love it for years though. The burgers here are not the thing to get--good but you miss out. Brats are the item I'd suggest--they are just so damn good. Many would say they rank with Schmidt's but I wouldn't say that exactly. They are Kobe Bryant next to Michael Jordan. They are a bit different from the tourist trap giant; less authentic but still not tailgate throw ons--if you get what I mean. The other items are great too--spanning typical bar food to wowsers. Last night I was in the mood for a club sandwich which was price well and I expected to be standard--it wasn't. It was the best Club I had this year.\\n\\nService here has always been excellent. The draft choices range outside the ordinary a bit. They make decent mix drinks, though not a correct Long Island but I am picky with that. \\n\\nNegatives: they can get busy and there is no room to wait inside. There are benches under the canopies, but that can be hard when it rains;( especially this summer after we have relocated the city to the Pacific Northwest apparently.)  The wait can be long as many think this is more a bar and so will spend hours yucking it up even at a table. But it is the GV, you find a good place to eat where a group can get in quickly during peak times give me a call.\\n\\nIt is a good place to stop.

Recommended orders: Mezzes Platter, Thon au Miso. My wife and I had just arrived to Vancouver and got settled in our accommodations. One of the nearest restaurants was this gem which came highly recommended by our host. Whenever I arrive at a restaurant for a late lunch at 1:30 pm it's a coin toss what the service is going to be like. The post-lunch period is usually downtime or at least a chance for staff to regroup after a big rush and yet I am still going to be hungry if it's 1:30 and if your establishment is open I should feel okay to walk in and order. Nevertheless one can feel the resentment from one's server at such times, if it's there. What I'm saying is no one acted like we were a pain in their ass here.* I had Seared Albacore Tuna Miso and my wife had the Mezzes platter. Both were very well done and presented nice. The Mezzes platter had Haloomi cheese and eggplant and a bunch of other feisty flavours. The Tuna miso was outstanding, and the four cubes of Tuna were nestled in a sauce that had a beautiful balance of Miso and something creamy that I couldn't quite figure out. But strangely the Tuna was almost over-shadowed by the amazing way they did their green beans. Like who gets excited about green beans when it's next to a wonderful piece of Tuna? They were just that good. One nice side-note is that they work to ensure all fish on their menu are sustainable. Their coffee is delicious too.

Now to my review,  I  had seen this place on the Food Network and my wife and I were trying to decide where to eat between Hamilton Pools and San Antonio. I had totally forgotten about seeing Salt Lick BBQ on TV until it came up on yelp.  I immediately recognized it and we decided we had to go. The Salt Lick is unlike any place that I had ever eaten at. When you pull into the driveway the parking lot could easily park several hundred cars and there were hundreds of picnic tables inside and in adjoining buildings and outside. I'm guessing they could easily sit a couple thousand people and serve them. I'm told that often there is a couple hour wait, too. I so badly want to come back when it is that busy because it would be fascinating to simply watch them manage this huge set up. We lucked out and it wasn't busy at all. Our server was good and he made some suggestions. I asked about the sausage and honestly told me that he doesn't care for it because he doesn't tolerate greasier food. Why is this good, because I also don't tolerate that food well. Then I couldn't decide so I got the Rancher Plate which included brisket, turkey, ribs, and sausage. Everything was the best I had ever had, except the sausage because I couldn't tolerate it and I wanted room in my stomach for the rest of the simply amazing bbq. I actually thought the turkey was the best, but the ribs and brisket were also awesome. Then I noticed that not only did they have home made pecan pies but also chocolate pecan pies.  I make am awesome chocolate pecan pie each thanksgiving. It's one of my absolute favorite desserts. The server told me it was good, yet I was skeptical. I'm not trying to brag, but my chocolate pecan pie is very very good. Could a restaurant one measure up? I took one bite. You know the sensation you get when you experience a Heavenly bite and your eyes just roll back and euphoria takes over? This was that sensation. This pie made my awesome pie taste like something you would get at Dennys or Marie Calenders. As I walked out I liked on Google to see if the recipe for the pie was out there.  It wasn't, but I found a cook book with most of the Salt Lick recipes in it including the chocolate pecan pie. I immediately ordered it from amazon and can't wait to make this pure at home, back in Idaho. The Salt Lick is phenomenal."},{"name":"McCoy's Bar & Grill","address":"9300 Jeff Fuqua Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Service was great.

The dough was still half raw. The chicken dinner was supposed to be grilled chicken, fries and salad. They gave rice instead of salad, ok not a big deal...except the rice was flavorless.

We went with oysters and littlenecks for our app (excellent), which came with 3 different accompaniments. Of note, these straight-from-the-ocean mollusks were probably shucked the best I've seen in the area (zero remaining connective tissue, no grit, perfect amount of liquor left in the shell), which on one hand isn't a huge thing because it's not like other places are bad at shucking by any means; but on the other hand, it says that Row 34 knows its stuff and pays attention to detail.

Most unusual chef's recommendation I've ever had.\\n\\nIt was the newspaper review in the window that brought me in the first time. The article declared the food \\"Not bad, but bland\\"\\nWhich I found so damned amusing I just had to find out how it really was.\\nAnd to prevent myself from experiencing the mentioned blandness ordered a 4/5 spice red curry. \\"Are you sure?\\" My server (The owner's thirteen-ish year old daughter?) asked. \\"Oh yeah, it's ok, I like spicy food.\\" She came back ten minutes later to warn me again, giving me one last chance to back out.\\nI refused to back down.\\nMy lunch special was not going to suffer from blandness!\\n\\nSo when my meal arrived at my table, I tasted it and chuckled at how clever I was, because it was pretty much perfect, if a little watery.

The Swimming Rama is superior to everywhere else, using crushed raw peanuts instead of a jar of skippy peanut butter to make their peanut sauce. The decor is regularly being upgraded as it becomes financially possible because the owners care about their business.

I called ahead to put a note on the reservation stating it was our friends birthday can we please surprise her with a dessert, no problem at all... We did get seated on time so theres that. We did not have anyone come to the table for at least 25 minutes. Fine enough we're not in a hurry. Its escalating quickly...\\n\\nWaitress comes over squishes herself between my friend. I turned around and her ass was in my face, ah ok... To say she was  very old was an understatement. No judgement there we've been to several restaurants with older waitresses. However, this one clearly was in over her head. While the restaurant may think its charming that she speaks native Italian her lack of basic understanding of the English language was a problem. She was also EXTREMELY gruff seemingly only concerned about what else we can order.\\n\\nThree of our party really enjoyed their dinners. Mine well the old lady got it all wrong. I asked for a margherita pizza with roasted red peppers added to it. No problem says Nonna. Ummm yeah, not what I got nary a piece of basil to be found on my pizza. Our other friends' pizza barely had any pepperoni on it. I'm seeing a pizza pattern here. \\n\\nFast forward to the end of the meal. Trying to get Nonna's attention to get the dessert menu in hopes they'll remember to bring over a dessert for our birthday girl. Thirty minutes later Nonna returns with all her sass when we expressed frustration. Despite wanting to leave we did order dessert, again I was hoping they'd acknowledge my request. They sang happy birthday to another table but nope nothing for my friend. \\n\\nUnfortunately for Nonna her 10% tip reflected the service we were given. It seems to me Antico Forno is riding the \\"we're a decent restaurant in the North End, its Saturday we don't have to provide decent service because if this party doesn't return someone else will.\\" \\n\\nLong story short, we won't be returning we'll go to Al Dente or Rabia's next door.

The first thing I noticed is that it looks much more like a night club, with two large bars and a stage, than a restaurant. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I generally don't tend to associate good food and night clubs. The menu is fairly extensive with a fair bit of a variety. There was plenty on there that sounded good from their description, but ultimately I chose the classic Cuban sandwich. \\n\\nI'd like tell you in detail about the nuance and cacophonous blend of the pork and ham and cheese and mayonnaise, but well, it was really quite plain. It tasted like a Cuban sandwich I would make. Don't let that itself turn you off from this place, there were plenty of other menu items that are probably decent. They just seemed a bit overpriced and I was in the mood for a sandwich. \\n\\nThe service is only fair at best. I'll be generous and give it a sold C -. I saw my waitress once when I ordered, once upon delivering the check. She messed up my drink order, too.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I don't think I'll be visiting this place again.

The staff at Antico is really friendly and helpful when choosing your pizza. After you order you can sit in the kitchen while you wait for your pizza. They bring it out to you fresh from the oven and you can eat in the kitchen too! While the parking and the menu are somewhat limited, there are only 9 types of pies you can order, the flavors and the experience are well worth the trip. \\n\\nOn to the pizza - like I said this is definitely on the top of my Atlanta pizza list. The flavors are extreme due to the fresh ingredients they use at Antico. We ordered the Margherita pizza which has on it san marzano tomatoes, bufala cheese, basil, and garlic. Not only were the toppings very intense and flavorful, the dough itself was also extremely delicious. The pizza is neopolitan style so it has a crispy but tender crust. The crust was also slightly charred on the bottom (due to the way they cook it in stone oven) which added a little smoky-ness to the flavor as well. \\n\\nOverall this pizza was amazing and the experience was great.

The lady at the counter was beyond accommodating and just super nice. In a world where most people no longer think being kind to each other matters, the nice folks who haven't forgotten the ancient art of good customer service stand out. It says a lot about their establishment as well, that they probably put a lot of effort into the little details of running a cafe. \\n\\nSo at first I didn't get it but then it hit me as I was walking (5 min) here from the Hawthorne- there's a big-ass red line on the road that if you follow it takes you to the cafe! It also continues on past the RL cafe so I know, I know, the line came before the cafe. I'm just saying that at first I heard the name and I was like, \\"huh?\\" But now I sort of get it! \\n\\nNow on to the crepes. I got the Bella Nutella. The day before I'd had a banana, honey, and PB crepe at another place in Salem which I shall not mention because the aforementioned crepe was a hot, sloppy mess. I like to be able to just cut into a crepe with the side of my fork. Well this crepe was tough and I couldn't do that. And everything else about it was just... No. \\n\\nThe Bella Nutella was like a palette cleanser of sorts after my depressing crepe experience. It was soft, chewy, and easy to cut with my fork. Oozing Nutella, strawberries, and bananas. Makes my mouth water just thinking of it! Complimented by a coconut iced latte. I easily cleaned my plate, drank my entire latte, and polished off half of my husband's frozen cappuccino while he was inside talking to the lady at the counter. Oops. Oh and I mentioned previously how incredibly kind the staff is at RL? Yeah, they made my husband a sandwich that wasn't even on the menu. I'm sure they do that all the time but it's just another example of how some businesses go out of their way to be good to their customers.\\n\\nIf I lived in Salem I'd go here every weekend, sit outside and people watch as I devour the best crepes ever and order a huge latte to wash it all down.

Although they revamped the bun, I'm still partial to the ciabatta roll that they use for another sandwich. Better yet, imagine that golden fried bliss on a Fleur De Lys roll, the echelon of local breads. The Chicken n' Dumplings are a bit better than average, but great deal for ~$4.

My friends and I are literally hooked on this place. I actually dined here four times a week before!

Repeat, only eat in front of your nearest and dearest). I went for it and took the biggest bite I could, which sadly was not nearly big enough. My boyfriend collapsed into hysterics. I fought my way through it, sharing bites with my beloved. It provided a lip tingling heat. Wonderful. I loved the little crispy bits that came off the chicken. I admitted defeat and wrapped up the rest of this treat for later. We also enjoyed the bf's regular fried chicken with a side of coleslaw that had a great little smoke to it.

Our cashier definitely seemed annoyed that we were having trouble putting our order for 4 together. \\n\\nAfter that, my group stood awkwardly near the beverage coolers since there was no where to sit. I headed to the kitchen area to try to find a place for us, but it was completely packed. It reminded me of going into the cafeteria for school lunch in 6th grade.

The brisket....the brisket i've come to discover is usually better by the second plate.  The first is usually fatty or super lean.  One of the last times i went it seemed like end scraps.  I'm probably a brisket fan mostly and it really means a lot to get a nice brisket with good smoke on it, nice marble on it and just good flavor.  Onward dessert!  Their pecan pie is some of the best i've had.  although, it's not traditional pecan pie.  They put a little sweet potato in it for flavor and texture (not a bad thing in my opinion) and the kicker, they don't have milk for desserts!  The made me sad beyond belief.

Anyhow lady at the counter was very nice to us when we ordered.  Then the food came out in a flash and cooked well.  I had the fish and chips, which did not actually come with chips but a side item, I did not really get that and had the fish and clam chowder it seems.  I thought the chowder was rather watery but the fish was very tasty.  My old lady had the grilled Mahi with rice and zucchini.  Oddly the best thing in the place was their rice to me.

Group of ppl went from 3 to 6 and it took our server another 15mins to take our orders.  One patron rqstd extra salad dressing when ordering and that didn't come until after the 3rd rqst.

Another server was added to our party who was just as disorganized & extremely disinterested as the first and whom we didn't even know was serving due to his lack of introduction.  No one ever came to check on our meals. No one ever came to re-fill our drinks or clear our tables. The manager on duty, Mr. Aaron Buggs II dropped off an order of fries to our table. No condiments in sight but, did high five a gentleman sitting with us before asking if anything else was needed & then leaving.  At the end of the night, we had 3 additional items on our tab that we're not ordered. We did not play musical chairs and move abt to cause this confusion. Our servers never came back!!!  We had to get up and search for them to pay our bill!!! For the extra items charged on our bill, we sought out Mr. Buggs and was pretty much told in so many words, tough tit!

Forget about finding parking around the area and just pay for the valet. \\n\\nI prefer to dine at Ruth's Chris instead of Morton's in Boston because of the noise level. Granted, American steakhouses are known to be rather noisy but generally I've found Ruth's Chris to be a little quieter, allowing me to carry a conversation without having to raise my voice. I also find the tables to be more comfortable relative to the booths you'd find at Morton's. \\n\\nNow, onto the food.

Actually we wound up here cause we went to Port 305 and there was a 45 min wait and they told us we might want to try Siros.  When we got there it was pretty empty, that should have been our first bad sign.\\n\\nSo are standing in the outdoor seating area and there is noone at the hostess stand.  Finally after 5 min just before we went inside to see whats up someone came out then seated us.  Our waitress(I wish I could remember her name) then came over and asked if we wanted a drink.  So we asked for water and a drink menu.  She brought the water  over relativity quickly and then came back to us asking what we would like to drink still not having gotten the drink menu that was asked for.  She got that and then my friend ordered a drink and I just stuck with water for now.    While waiting for the drink to arrive another table was seated got their drinks and was already ordered food.  While we still waited.\\n\\nSo she finally came with the drink and said she would be right back for out order.  Well as I am sure you could guess she wasn't right back.  So we finally ordered.  It wasn't till after we ordered and I heard another waitress at a different table telling her table what the specials were that I even knew they had specials. As she came by again I decided to get their \\"Bulldog Lemonade\\" (basically lemonade and gin). She looked at me funny like I was ordering something from space, but then she said ok Bulldog Lemonade got it (that should have been another sign).  This drink surprisingly came much faster than the first. After drinking a few sips I thought that it was either very weak, so sweet i couldn't taste the gin, or missing the alcohol. but I let it go for now....\\n\\nSo finally our food came and she asked if we needed anything else and  I asked for some ketchup and hot sauce.  She said ok then went to get a credit card from another table.  As I am waiting for a while for what I asked she finally comes back with their bill but not my ketchup and hot sauce.  She then comes back to us to ask if everything was ok and I look at her.  And she says right ketchup.  Now I have had my food almost 10 minutes already.  So I finally get them and eat.  I would say it was mediocre at best.  Nothing that good to justify the price.\\n\\nSo we asked for our bill and we some how got it pretty quick.  But that didn't last long cause it took long again for her to come back for the card.  But while we were waiting I looked at the bill I discovered why my drink didn't taste right.  She only gave  me a plain lemonade and not the Drink special one I ordered. \\n\\nOk so maybe all the waitresses there were not as incompetent as this one.  I even heard here tell another table she gave their bill to another table.  I could maybe see this if the place was packed and she had a ton of tables but she only had 2 others and the place was dead I could see her service going down a bit but not to this point. The waitress at the table next to us seemed pretty good and even the trainee seemed better and more detailed than our waitress.\\n\\nSo the horrible service(which got a bare minimum tip or less) and the mediocre \\"high end\\" yet high priced food got this a low rating. And it would have been nice if the outdoor tv was working also to get score updates on the Sox.\\n\\nLastly I would have thought that a restaurant right on the water would have more that 2 seafood items on the menu.  It wasn't after till i was leaving that I saw a sign saying it was an Italian restaurant which seemed like more of a joke cause there were only like 3 Italian dishes on the menu.\\n\\nWe commented as we left that we would probably never go back there again"},{"name":"Flapjak Creperie","address":"4220 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I was just thinking, o yay, another crepe place, but this one is not just another crepe place, it's a crepe place that has excellent toppings, fresh squeeze juices and smoothies.

The bard part was that my dish arrived within a minute. \\nIt arrived so fast that there is no way that it could have been cooked \\"on order\\". \\nThe fact that at first bite, it felt barely lukewarm confirmed my fear: My Omelette had been waiting for me, alone under a UV lamp:  Pre-cooked and then left waiting a bit too long.  \\n\\nLong story short, it's ok, it's not fantastic, and it's a bit on the pricey side. \\nNevertheless, I appreciate the fact that they don't have a blaring TV, I appreciate the service and the attention and courtesy of the staff and manager. \\n\\nSo, Dear Mr. Aquitaine, if you read this, here is a point or two that you may consider:\\n\\nSometimes, less is more ... No need to Over-Fluff some dishes. \\n\\nDouble check where in France you'll find a 100% no-dressing-watercress-salad served with a steak-frites, I'll report them to the authorities and they'll be promptly Guillotined. \\nThe acidity of a vinaigrette is here to cut the fat \\"feeling\\" of the frites. Works well, believe me... Try it. \\n\\nWhy not serve a mini croissant instead of the Cinnamon bun? If French you want to be.....  \\n\\nDitch the thyme in the Escargots. (apparently, it's been done)\\n\\nOmelettes:  Try to lightly brush some melted butter on it. That's a \\"Lyonnaise\\" trick.  \\n\\nFor your menu:  Word - Tools - language - French  and then spell check. \\nSometimes in French, an accented letter can change the whole meaning of a word. \\nThat could be the difference between a \\"Market Salad\\" and a \\"Walking Salad\\"\\n\\nSame with \\"Biers\\" on your front window.  You might want to consider a spell check.\\n\\nAll of that been said, I have been invited to the Aquitaine in Chestnut Hill.  I'll definitively go, and if I see a difference between the two restaurants, I'll post an update."},{"name":"Treehouse Truck","address":"","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My first taste of Treehouse Truck was tonight at the Apopka Food Truck Round Up and I'm still stuffed!

We opted for the bar and thought it would be a good opportunity to chat it up with one of the bartenders (we counted 3, maybe 4 -- we aren't quite sure what #4 was actually doing).  We were greeted by one of the bartenders and quickly decided we had made a mistake.  The bartenders seemed to really be into chatting with each other and not as interested in us.  We ordered a glass of the Malbec which was a good choice.  Rich in flavor yet not as overpowering as say a Merlot, we were able to sit with our glass of wine and chat.  Eventually after we finished the glass and waited and waited and waited the bartender came back over and we quickly ordered another glass along with the spice dusted marcona almonds.  Not sure what the spice was since it had mostly settled to the bottom of the dish it was served in, but the almonds were good.  We asked a few questions about the menu (if this restaurant is called Pairings why aren't there suggestions of which foods and which wines should be paired together?)  \\n\\nAt this point we were sipping our second glass of wine and ready to order a few other bits of food.

I spent a few years post college doing the vegetarian thing. And since Indian cuisine is so vegetarian friendly, it quickly became a staple in my diet. Fast forward to now: I eat meat again (because lets be real, a world without steak is a world I don't want to live in) and I still can't get enough of this stuff. \\n\\nWe actually went and dined in... which normally we get take out just because a lot of Indian restaurants have the tendency to be umm.. a little awkward? However, this wasn't awkward at all. The servers were extremely friendly and really cared about how our experience was, despite being slammed. Definite bonus points. \\n\\nThey offer complimentary pappadum to start with the usual trio of sauces, which is like CRACK to me. I love condiments and I'm pretty sure I could put that tamarind sauce on cardboard and I would love it. The mint sauce was perfect and not overly minty which is the reason I'm not a big fan at other places. The red chutney was delightful too, and had a bit of spice which was unexpected and awesome at the same time. We ordered samosas to start, just to have another vehicle for those sauces. \\n\\nFor entrees, we ordered the paneer makhani and the tandoori chicken tikka. I'm a huge fan of makhani. Tomato-y, creamy, spicy... whats not to like? And this one was the best of the best. The chicken tikka is basically served like Indian fajitas. I had never tried this before (or anything off the tandoori menu) but when we walked in the restaurant, we saw a few come out of the kitchen on those blistering hot cast iron skillets and the smell was mesmerizing. The flavor of the chicken was amazing, you could really taste the Indian spices as well as the ginger without being overpowering. \\n\\nWhat we ended up doing was taking the rice, topping it with the paneer makhani and then mixing in the chicken tikka + the onions and peppers. It was the perfect combination, as I like sauces with my protein and I would have been a little less satisfied if I didn't have the makhani sauce with the tikka. \\n\\nOh and we got garlic naan, duh.

Upon arriving, we were informed that they had run out of 1 app and 1 entree from the menu.  We were a little bit disappointed initially and my husband ended up ordering off of the regular menu.  We were both blown away by our meals!  I had the asparagus appetizer, bluefish and chocolate mousse from the discounted menu.  The fish was so delicious, the skin was very flavorful and the fish perfectly cooked.  My husband raved about his chicken and proclaimed it the best chicken he had ever eaten.  The only course that was slightly underwhelming was his pavlova dessert.  We would have appreciated a bit more tart flavor, perhaps a plain or greek yogurt to balance out the sweetness of the meringue.  But altogether amazing food.  And almost forgot, we were given many freebies - a seafood appetizer, a mango sorbet and a grapefruit granita which were all so tasty!\\n\\nAMBIENCE: lovely as always.  Modern and elegant.

My friend Megan had stumbled upon the place while looking up reviews for The Gallows due to her love for charcuterie.  We had checked out the menu together earlier in the week, and the prices were very reasonable.  So of course after a long day of consuming Gin & Tonics and summer Harpoon brews we were ready to consume some salty pig parts.  We called ahead around 6:30pm to see if we could put our name on a list/make reservations for aroun 7pm.  The hostess made us a reservation, but the reservation was not necessary, which we soon realized when we arrived.  The place was starting to pick up, but there were definitely still tables open.  \\n\\nWhen we sat down we immediately perused the food menu before we even looked at the drinks--clearly, we were hungry.  I honestly can't tell you everything that we ordered because Megan is the charcuterie expert, but I do know that we ordered the Speck, which was amazing, marianted olives, and one of the cheeses that the waitress recommended, saying that it was brie-like (honestly, how can you not turn down a cheese that is compared to brie--awesome).  We also ordered the fig jam.  The fig jam coupled with this brie-like cheese was perfection.  I love the sweet and savory together, and fig jam is not overly sweet to begin with--all in all extremely satisfying.  One thing I will say I was slightly annoyed with was the amount of bread we were initially given.  There were four of us, and when the charcuterie first came out they gave us four tiny pieces of toasted baguette--obviously not nearly enough for all of the charcuterie we ordered.  When we requested more bread they brought over a good size basket of the toasted baguette pieces without charge.  \\n\\nAfter we finished up our first board of charcuterie we decided to get some pizzas.  My boyfriend and I split a pepperoni pizza.  Megan and her boyfriend Sohail split some sort of cheese/margarita pizza.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but I compare all woodfired pizzas to Picco, which I have a complete obsession with, and this pizza was definitely not up to Picco quality, but still very tastey.  After we polished off our pizzas we decided we to go ahead and order more charcuterie--including the brie-like cheese and the fig jam once again in whatever other deliciousness Megan ordered.  Megan commented that it was amusing that we sandwiched our meal with one charcuterie at the beginning and one at the end with pizza in the middle.  The hungry day-drinker wants what it wants.\\n\\nNow to the drinks.  I can't speak for anyone else at the table because I was so focused on myself and the tastey food around me.  I ordered the Dartmouth St. Cooler, which was very refreshing for a humid summer evening.  I also ordered a standard Allagash White--you can't go wrong with that if you're looking for a nice white Belgian beer.\\n\\nFinally, the check came.  We split it 4 ways, and each of us paid about $29 not including tip.  Not bad for 2 charcuterie boards, 2 pizzas, and probably about 6 alcoholic beverages.  I will definitely be back, as their sandwich menu is very enticing."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was somewhat excited to visit Boston's Ruth's Chris location and was accompanied by four close friends of mine. We all arrived on time but our table wasn't yet ready and some of us decided to walk to the bar and get some drinks while the rest of the gang waited by the hostess desk. \\n\\nAbout twenty minutes later, we were finally brought to our table, located in one of the many small, side-rooms which this place has. Our waiter was very friendly and within just a few minutes, I had placed my order, which in my case was a New York strip steak, cooked medium. As sides I had a baked potato and some creamed spinach. And to start, after my hesitation, I decided to get their simple and to-the-point Steak House salad which is a combination of various salads (romaine, lettuce and iceberg) with cherry tomatoes, garlic croutons and red onions. \\n\\nWe all happily conversed and drank our cocktails while waiting for the food. I couldn't help but the notice that the decor of the place was rather swank and chic, and yet there was a randomly placed, giant LCD television in the middle of our tiny room, against a wall. It looked completely out of place and in my opinion ruined the decor and atmosphere. Not that it was on or anything, but it just felt wrong having it there, especially in such a histories building as the one that this steakhouse is in. They are in the old City Hall building that the city of Boston used up until the late '60s but you'd never know it since most of the restaurant has a very modern, sleek look to it instead of a classic one which I thought was shameful. But I digress, as I'm here to discuss the food.\\n\\nThe shtick at Ruth's Chris, what put them on the map of the steak-serving world is the fact that they sear their steaks at 1800 degrees, an extremely high temperature; a fairly quick process which enables them to bring the sizzling pieces of protein right to your table after it's been drenched in butter. I noticed that their steaks weren't dry aged and were instead wet aged, a process which in my opinion isn't nearly as good for flavor depth and profile. The meat was tender though although cooked a bit more medium rare than rare. It was decent but not even remotely close to being as good as what I've had at other spots like Smith & Wollensky's or even The Capital Grill. It tasted similar to something I could have produced myself and I didn't feel like their high heat gimmick added anything to the flavor or enhanced it in any way. I felt utterly disappointed. The sides that came with it were decent.\\n\\nOn the upside, the drink I had at the bar was great (I had a Manhattan) and the service was both friendly and attentive. The prices are average for steak houses but again, having been to other steak houses in Boston, this one definitely isn't up to par with the rest of the competition."},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Finally got over there.

Though I don't go as often, Surly has a lot to offer on a night in the ShoNo.\\n\\nFirst, I think of Surly Girl as a great place in the winter. It's cozy, warm, dark. Still, any season is fun, what with the seasonal cocktail menu and all. Infused vodkas behind the bar almost always make me head towards the liquor instead of the beer, but the beer list is pretty good too.\\n\\nPirate-vintage-punk-chic decor is weird but it works. When the front of the house is busy, sometimes you can find a table in the dark hole at the back of the restaurant, but you'll have to walk up to the bar for service. I'm glad the option is there, but it's so nice when you can get a table.\\n\\nThey'll check IDs at the front door, even if you're just coming in to eat. As someone who is well over 21, I don't mind this-- keeps me from having to fish out my ID every time when ordering a drink, but be aware if you've got younger peeps in your party.\\n\\nThe food is okay. I'd say it's better than most bar food, but the execution is a little hit-or-miss. It's \\"creative comfort\\" food, like mac and cheese, frito pie. The menu is broad and has something for every taste. If you're having enough seasonal cocktails, or you're coming in late-night, the food will taste delicious. It's really not bad, it's just not ahhh-maze-ing. Portions are pretty large.\\n\\nService isn't great. My biggest gripe with Surly Girl is that there doesn't seem to be a focus on a particular service approach. Some individuals are so so so nice and friendly, but others are dismissive. I don't know how they divvy up the responsibilities, but sometimes it feels like everyone is ignoring you. It just doesn't seem as efficient as it could be. \\n\\nThey used to have events and theme nights (punk rock aerobics, for example), but I just checked their website and none are listed. I dunno if events are on hiatus or what the story is... but I always thought that was a neat feature of Surly Girl.\\n\\nIn the end, Surly Girl is a fun time.

The glass table tops over cloth on the tables slides around quite freely which made me nervous. The windowsill near our table was grimy/dirty and resulted in frequent wet wipe usage.

Having a hard time finding this place just look for the line.  One advice be prepared to wait.  In my opinion the place must be good if there is a line.\\n\\nI honestly don't remember how long we waited, but after you stand in line and see the happy faces walk out the door and take a whiff of the food you are not going anywhere.

Its always nice to have an open kitchen to allow you to see the magic in action.  \\n\\nNow I noticed on some of the rare negatives review they complained about the wait, the small tables and the service. First of all let me just say you don't wanna wait and you wanna sit in a nice comfortable table? Then there are a bunch of other empty restaurants with a lot of tables for you to sit on. We don't want to hear your complaints about how bad the food was.  You need to sacrifice if you want good food. Regarding the service, we had the waitress someone complained about. If you can't handle sarcastic humor then just eat your food and don't talk. Our waitress was awesome and just a pleasure to talk story with.  \\n\\nNow the food....ohhhh the food.  Be aware you will have difficulty deciding what to eat.   Everything on the menu sounds so good. After a reviewing the menu we couldn't decide so 6 of us decided to do it family style so we can try everything. We ordered Lobster ravioli, fried calamari, Fusili, Pumpkin ravioli, butternut squash and garlic bread.  \\n\\nI'm not a Italian food expert but this was definitely amazing food.  My favorite was the lobster ravioli but honestly I would be happy to eat everything else. I would suggest eating family style if you have a big group.

I know, so last minute...  But Midtown and Alpharetta, which are the two locations (of their three in GA) that I could use the Groupon at, are so far from my house.  Finally, I had to use it so I took my sister, Yoomee H., to this one in Alpharetta for lunch on a Tuesday.\\n\\nThe last two times I when I went to the other two locations, I ordered the Honey Curry Grilled Georgia Chicken sandwich, which is delicious.  I like to stick to what I know and love, so I already knew before walking in that this was what I wanted to order again.\\n\\n* Honey Curry Grilled Georgia Chicken Sandwich ($11) - Per my review for the Sandy Springs location, this sandwich consists of grilled chicken with arugula (salad greens) and red peppers between warm, herb-encrusted focaccia bread.  Honest to God, this is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had in Georgia!  I chose fries as my side, and they serve honey curry sauce with the sandwich which you can spread over the grilled chicken and use to dip your fries.  The honey curry sauce is definitely what makes this sandwich so mouth-watering!  I had to ask for more sauce (no extra charge - YAY!) because it's just that good. \\n\\nMy sister ordered the Georgia Organic Pork BBQ Sandwich ($12) and really enjoyed it!  She also wanted an appetizer so she picked the Homemade \\"5\\" Pretzel.\\n\\n* Homemade \\"5\\" Pretzel ($5) - This large soft pretzel is made of organic buckwheat flour (ooh, fancy!) and is served literally in the shape of the number \\"5.\\"  Per the menu, it's served with a \\"creamy mustard cheese,\\" which sounds delicious - but I really wasn't a fan.  It has a really strong, slightly spicy horseradish-y flavor to it that overpowered the mustard flavor, and I couldn't really taste the cheese.  The pretzel itself was warm, soft, and good, but nothing special.  I liked the pretzel a whole lot more dipped in the sweet, cinnamon-y sauce that is served with sweet potato fries (which my sister got).  I wouldn't order this again.\\n\\nOverall, 5 Seasons North gets 4 stars - for their wonderful food and friendly service!  This restaurant is pretty large, but there were only 2 or 3 other tables of customers when we went.  I didn't mind this at all because this allowed for our food to be served fairly quickly.  If it wasn't so out of the way for us, we would come here more often.

It's certainly the best Neapolitan pizza in the city, bar none. However, many would contend that it's the best in the country. Antico was named best pizza in the United States by the Festa Della Pizza in Naples in 2010.\\n\\nFood: Antico offers approximately a dozen different pizzas, all of which are sizable enough to feed at least 2-3 people. My personal favorite is the Fromaggio, which includes four different cheeses, fresh garlic, and basil. The Margherita is another favorite when I'm accompanied by guests with more traditional palates. Antico uses san marzano tomatoes, which are considered by many chefs to be the very best in the world. Although they get less attention on Yelp, Antico also sells some of the best cannoli that I've ever ingested; both the shells and filling are made fresh daily. They do not have a liquor license, so all alcohol is BYOB and the vast majority of customers take full advantage of the opportunity. \\n\\nService: Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I've never had an issue with service at Antico. In particular, the girls that work the front counter have always been pleasant and willing to answer any questions. Yes, they may appear inpatient at times, but so would I if there was a line out the door. If you're looking for preferential treatment, then I'd recommend dining elsewhere. Antico has no shortage of customers and the management really has no qualms about offending an occasional customer. It's just the nature of the beast, folks.\\n\\nAtmosphere: A visit to Antico is a chaotic but completely unique experience. Once your order is placed, you're responsible for finding a seat at one of a handful of communal tables, which are located in the actual kitchen. Clientele is eclectic and the mood is incredibly lively. \\n\\nCost: Moderately pricey, but fully commensurate with the food quality. Pizzas range between $18 and $21.\\n\\nOther: As others have noted, Antico does not allow any substitutions. I personally don't have a problem with this, particularly considering that they make this perfectly clear on the menu. Also, they do run out of dough on most days, so you should consider calling beforehand if you plan to dine after 9 PM."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Defiantly not your traditional full plate eatery but the best darn beer, salted meat and amazing cheese.

But when your 3 course Prix Fixe runs around $65/person, and the wine list lists far more 3 digit wines than two digit wines, you better nail it on all fronts.  Craigie on Main had too many misses.  But first, give credit where credit is due:\\n\\n1. If it isn't on the menu, try to special order the bone marrow.  This was Olympian bone marrow.  Yes, you will gain several pounds.  Yes, your cholesterol levels will skyrocket.  It is worth it.  An order comes with 3 bones, you really only need one bone per person unless someone plans to make a meal out of it.  You don't need one of those little marrow spoons, you need a marrow tablespoon.  Just do it.\\n\\n2. Food preparation was generally excellent, and there was an extremely wide range of ingredients, textures, and tastes to orchestrate.  The kitchen was, to use rock and roll band terms, tight.\\n\\n3. Want a food adventure?  You have found your wild ride.  You will have the opportunity to eat things you may have never eaten, or eat things you have eaten before but concocted in a unique fashion.  With Craigie on Main you will experience a crazy culinary roller coaster.\\n\\nBut...\\n\\n1.  That roller coaster tipped over the rails several times.  Just a few examples:  (a) Chocolate plus Mexican spice continues to be in vogue, and twice that combination was delivered.  The idea here is to provide just barely enough heat and flavor offset from the Mexican side of the border to draw out nuances in the chocolate.  The Mexican flavors and heat here destroyed the chocolate, making the dishes inedible.  (b) Similarly, one of the sorbets was so tart, it utterly numbed the palette.   (c) A coquillage of generally yummy bits of several shellfish broke down into a cacophony of flavors and textures - and some of the bits were cooked to rubber; too much all at once.\\n\\nOne could chalk up these missteps to the desire to take the diner on that great culinary adventure though, and many of our other dishes were excellent.  One or two dishes, beside the bone marrow, were even transcendent, however:\\n\\n2. Bottle of red wine served too warm, north of 70 degrees.   At your local pub, okay, forgiven, but not here and not at these prices.\\n\\n3. Glass of wine delivered by the server who swirled the glass furiously before putting it down on the table, and he stopped only when requested, and he protested that request.  Hey, if I want to swirl my wine to open it up I will, but this swirling over-fascination was an intrusion, a presumption, and unacceptable.\\n\\n4. Service either overwhelmed or was non-existent.  There was a 15 minute window where we saw nobody, with all our dirty plates stacked up in front of us.  But then there was a rush, you could barely sip your water without it getting refilled.  Service was, being nice here, rough around the edges.\\n\\n5. We were not once, but twice, by different servers, hard sold the tasting menu.  Did they steal these servers from the lot stalkers of Boch Toyota or Muzi Ford?  In both cases when it was clear that we were not biting they kept going on.  Funny how they could take several minutes to blast us with tasting menu pitch, but couldn't get us first glass of wine/cocktails within 15 minutes of ordering.\\n\\nFinally, I asked 3 different servers to turn down the rock music coming out of the speaker right over my head.  Eventually, using hand signals with a sharp bus person, the music got turned down - about 30 minutes into the seating.  If I want to listen to acid rock or Fleetwood Mac at volume, I will do that in the privacy of my own home or vehicle, thank you.  I couldn't hear the people across the table from me.  The response to my first request should have been, \\"Of course, right away!\\" with the execution nearly immediate, either that or they should have offered us the option to be reseated not so close to the ceiling speaker.\\n\\nAll in, Craigie on Main ran us nearly $150/each, and we did not tip @ 20%, it wasn't deserved. Funny thing, when Craigie was on Craigie, the service was excellent, and the kitchen, while still adventurous, produced more integrated, thoughtful, subtle, flawless food.  Feel free to buy into the hype, into the Cambridge coolness, but at half the price I will take the Ten Tables that now inhabits the original Craigie on Craigie half basement.\\n\\nThe bone marrow, alone though, almost made it worth it."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Disappointing.

We sat for about 15 minutes before our order being taken, which if you are familiar with the brunch menu is small and stays the same (there were 3 specials).  We ordered our food and waited.  My wife got Rancheros and was actually pretty surprised as the table next us got them and they were huge.   When her order came out it ws about half the size and they didn't make it with tofu as reqested so we had to send it back.  i had ordered there veggie hash, which was listed as having goat cheese.  I asked the waiter who asked if we wanted to add goat cheese, when I pointed out that it was supposed to come with it they wisked it away and added it.    Though my wife had to wait for her meal to arrive it was mostly cold but at this point she jsut wanted to leave.  While we were there 3 other tables sent food back, for missing items, wrong items and burned items.  Really, it was a bad experience, and if they lose the ability to be trusted about what they are serving to who someone is gonig to get sick.

It's like one or two blocks away from the mall The Loop.\\n\\nAnyway, we went for lunch today and ordered four different tacos, because they (and I) recommend two of them.  If you are a light eater, then you'd be fine with one and some fries or something.\\n\\nAll tacos were delicious.  This was the first time I had a fish taco, and I'm now a big fan.  I tried two different kinds, the Voodoo (Crispy Fish, Lettuce, Pineapple Mango Salsa & Voodoo Sauce...err...honey mustard like sauce) and the Wipeout (Steak & Shrimp, Fries, Jack Cheese, Salsa, Avocado, Baja Sauce) and the were both great.  I think the Voodoo was slightly better.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend had the Standard with pork and the Luau without the Teri sauce, because it's mayo-based and she hates mayo.  She also enjoyed hers although she said the pork wasn't as flavorful as Chipotle's carnitas.\\n\\nWe also tried the mojo fries and the zucchini fries.  The mojo fries are a bit too citric in the taste, but if you dip them in the dip they come with, they are easier to eat in large quantities.  I think they are best paired with beer.  The zucchini fries are sweet deep-fried vegetable madness.  If you are not opposed to killing a vegetable's goodness this way, they are very tasty.\\n\\nEverything was tasty, filling, and affordable.  The setting is also very casual and friendly. The staff is attentive and inviting.  The only thing they need is smoothies, because they only got soda, beer and sweet/unsweet tea.  For a restaurant that's evoking the islands, it definitely needs smoothies.\\n\\nGo check this place out before it explodes!

Whereas most destinations of this sort end up getting caught in the schizophrenia of which customer base to focus on, Harvard Gardens handles both sides of the restaurant.\\n\\nLiterally.\\n\\nA non-instrusive divider down the center of Harvard Gardens separates the lounge/bar from the dining area for the most part.  On a Saturday night, the lounge/bar was cramming room only, while the dining area was less claustrophobic (though not by much).  While groups of singles seem to predominate, there's still a nice balance in crowd makeup---but you're at a lounge, after all, so stop thinking so much and just, well, go lounge.  But you're hungry, too, right? Problem solved.\\n\\nThe best way to soak up the atmosphere and acclimate to the space is to take advantage of a dinner here.  You'll be seated in a much less cramped space in a solid booth with plenty of personal space.  You can soak up the ambience without worrying about spilling your Ketel Red Bull on your neighbor (leave that for when you squeeze your way to the other side...but more on that later).  \\n\\nThe  lobster gnocchi ($17) was tasty with a balanced texture---not rubbery like when it's overcooked, nor like bits of mashed potatoes when it's not quite done.  Of course with most pasta dishes that have the word \\"lobster\\" in them, one is always skeptical on the amount that's actually used in the preparation, but in Harvard Gardens' case, fresh breaks of lobster meat were well integrated throughout the dish (not a half lobster or anything, but more than the typical place, and enough to make you actually have enough to chew on and realize that you're paying for (some) lobster)).  The Harvard Gardens' spin on mac and cheese ($8) is a generous portion that can be taken as a meal of its own, presented in a way that's right on track with the decor. Altogether, the meal for two, with wine, was just south of $50 without tip.\\n\\nThe decor is modern urban and geometric. The soft seemingly fluroescent suggestions of reds, cremes, and orange colors radiating from the crevices add to the hip lounge feel, all the time making you wonder if the ghost of Dan Flavin is there for a drink himself.   As the crowd increases, even basic conversation in the dining area becomes a shouting match, so the only resolution is to experience the other half of the room.  Pay your dinner bill, then slide over to the lounge and start a tab. The lounge area gets extremely crowded, but isnt' that the point? It will be difficult to not overlap conversations and literally rub elbows (at a minimum) with the rest of your Constant Harvard Gardeners."},{"name":"Hastings Racecourse","address":"188 North Renfrew Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my first time to a racecourse, so I don't really have a whole lot to compare it to.

Ultimately, I was hoping for a suitable place to dine with my parents and I found it. Unlike Planet Hollywood, the noise level was excellent and my father was able to hear me with the need for raising my voice (hearing aids and all). We were seated on the inside of the restaurant just inside from the patio, which was the perfect place for us. Though the interior is dark, the large windows brought in massive amounts of light but kept the interior intimate. \\n\\nOur server was prompt and professional, and - again - my parents and I found ourselves ordering The Same Damn Thing - Atlantic Salmon topped with Smoked Salmon with mashed potatoes. Hubby ordered the Sirloin Steak, and we happily munched on the delicious soda bread while settling in to wait on our selections . . . \\n\\n. . . which came to the table less than 10 minutes later. The salmon was fine and completely cooked. The sirloin, on the other hand? See, we'd made sure to tell the server to cook the steak on the rare side. Hubby and I eat our steaks medium rare, and our experiences at the Disney resort that week had sent too many medium well or well done steaks our way. We specifically told the server to have the chef's cook on the rare side to avoid any more disappointing meals, but Raglan Road could not live up to the task of doing so.\\n\\nFirst steak that came out (less than 10 minutes after being ordered) was nearly well done. We went it back. Manager came to the table, said the steak would be on its way soon. 10 minutes later the new steak arrives . . . and isn't any better than the first. Feeling somewhat embarrassed for doing so, we sent the steak back again. After all, if you're paying $30 for a steak you want a piece of steak that you're happy with, right?\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, the third steak came back rare enough to eat. Unfortunately, the rest of the table had already finished their salmon, and poor hubby was left to eat alone =\\\\ \\n\\nThe manager did not offer to comp (pay for) the steak, which really should have been the appropriate gesture since by the time hubby received the steak he had ordered the rest of the table had finished.

The place was fairly busy, with some later breakfast diners and the start of a lunch crowd. \\n\\nIt's a nice, calm space with good service. The neighborhood is not sketchy or scary, despite what another review said, although you might need to park a block or two away on the street. Nothing unusual for Atlanta. \\n\\nThey offer some veg and vegan options and everything sounds yummy on the menu. I had a tough time deciding what to order. Unfortunately, I ended up wishing I had gone with the blueberry cornmeal flapjacks instead of the scramble I chose. The dish was fine, but a little on the bland side. I added a bit of hot sauce and salt, and it was much tastier. My BF and I also found the cheese grits to be a little under seasoned. Of course, I'd rather have them a bit less salted and add my own, as opposed to too salty. \\n\\nI'd definitely return to Stone Soup to try some other options.

I had a 6:15 PM reservation, and everything went smoothly.  The hosts were very friendly - and there were only two or three interactions, so they made a good first impression!  \\n\\nI waited a bit and a waiter promptly came to bring some water and asked if I would like some cheese and bread.  We took our time deciding what we wanted to eat and drink, but we were by no means rushed or felt rushed.  It was definitely very comfortable feeling.  The waiter was easy going, friendly, and attentive.\\n\\nSo aside from the great service experience, the food.  I had the \\"Strega\\" pasta dish and the scallops and shrimp were perfect.  I'm not that critical about food [which is ironic that I post on yelp], but this was some good stuff.  Not overcooked at all and just very tasty.  The linguine pasta was also very good, though the sauce was a bit strange.  Like I had tasted something similar, but I couldn't [and still can't] figure out what was so familiar about it.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pretty dark, but it's very nice inside.  I kept thinking I could totally see a wedding banquet or something being hosted in there with the giant arch thing they have in the middle of the main seating area.  Despite the dark and the somewhat close proximity to other tables, I didn't feel too cramped or on top of others.  It was a good arrangement.\\n\\nA bit far removed from the rest of the city, but the Waterfront area seems to be an up and coming place for higher end restaurants and condos.

Today was Italian and the Italian in the group picked Olive Garden.

She was very attentive and did a great job keeping our orders straight.  I can't say as much for the food. The salad was pretty yummy, but there was some bad lettuce in it.  When the time came to dig into my eggplant parmigiana, I was a bit disappointed. It was totally edible, but nothing extraordinary. The spaghetti it was served with was laughable. I've eaten way better prepared by people who don't get paid to cook. On the plus side, it was one of a host of dishes that either are or can be made vegetarian. \\n\\nIn the end, it's the service that bumps this from two to three stars.

There's nothing more satisfying than driving to a random strip mall in the suburbs, nervously walking into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant and then being rewarded with surprisingly delicious food.\\n\\nI love Kababs and Jeddo does them well. They offer a variety of different meat combinations (18 in total). You can choose from ground chicken, beef or lamb. They also offer salmon, beef tenderloin, cubed lambed, chicken and lamb shank.\\n\\nFor the vegetarians, they offer a vegetable kabab and a number of different vegetarian appetizers including hummus, cucumber & tomato salad and baba ghanoosh. \\n\\nI wanted the Lamb Barg Kabab, but they were out of lamb, so I ordered a #20 Jeddo Prince combination, consisting of one skewer of ground chicken and ground lamb. The combination comes with rice and salad (you have the option of all salad or all rice as well).\\n\\nFirst off, the meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. Some kababs i've had in the past were too dry. Not the case at Jeddo Kabab. The meat was moist, with just the right amount of outer char and grilling. I thought the the ground meat kababs were nicely spiced and seasoned.\\n\\nThe portions were large and an incredible value for $10.99. The combination came with a mound of saffron rice which was extremely flavorful and light. I added some butter to the rice which was a nice touch.\\n\\nAlso, opt-in for the half or whole salad. It's simple, but delicious. It consists of chopped lettuce and large chunks of cucumbers, tomatoes and onions topped with a vinaigrette that has a good balance of sweet and sour. It lightens the dish up and serves as a good counterbalance to the meat skewers. \\n\\nI also ordered the Kashk o Bademjoon which is an eggplant and whey based dip served with pita bread. As opposed to baba ghanoosh, I found it to be more savory. Its consistency is creamier and heavier with more garlic undertones.

I personally like to get mine plain, with ch√®vre, and I frequently accompany it with the truffle fries, with plenty of the fry sauce to dip them in. While I normally eschew condiments on my burgers, save the occasional specialty sandwich, I think that the fry sauce can make a nice addition to the burgers as well as to the fries. While the fries are accented with a taste of truffle, I wouldn't compare the taste to truffled fries that I've had elsewhere--it's not as three-dimensional a taste as many other places' truffle fries, though of course, it's much cheaper. They're not bad fries, just not great. It's the burger that makes this place worth going to. They're small, but one can work as a very light meal (it's about a quarter pound, I think), and once combined with fries (which they frequently provide in abundance, thanks to their system of providing food in bags), it's a decent sized meal for $7.\\n\\nI've had better burgers on Division, let alone in Portland. However, sometimes you need a quick bite, and Little Big Burger stands head and shoulders above any fast food joints, and has hours that are frequently better than those of the foocarts, even if it's not quite as good as the carts."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The food here is pretty good, and the location is great if you are catching a show or game at the Queen E or one of the Stadiums.

Excluding the travesty that they call a chocolate cake, the food (by itself) here was a definite four, and possibly five stars. Their menu is an interesting concept for sure. Great charcuterie and awesome pizza. The service was great and fairly quick too. \\n\\n... If you've read my reviews, you would also be aware that I like to go into maddening detail. With this, consider the above paragraph a TL;DR... here comes my massive assemblage of thoughts:\\n\\nSo, what did I have:\\n\\n1. Chorizo (from the \\"Salty Pig Parts\\" section)\\n2. Governatore pizza\\n3. Chocolate cake\\n\\n1. I learned ex-post (after the fact) how this part of the menu is actually supposed to work. This is a charcuterie board where you pick the parts that it will come with. Just ordering one thing will deprive you of the full experience. \\n\\nThe board was delicious though! Everything on it was of really high quality. The bread was fresh and tasty, the mustard was flavorful, but not mouth-scorchingly spicy, sitting right on the golden mean. The pickles were great in their balance too! The bring was a great blend of saltiness and sweetness, with an overall mild flavor. \\n\\nThen there was the chorizo. I did not find it too spicy (maybe a little bit) which is great for those who don't like too much heat. Other flavors were on point too, with a great savoriness, and not too much salt!\\n\\nHowever, based on my experience, I feel the charcuterie part of the menus is not a great value. Because I assume) the bread, mustard, and pickles come with the board as opposed to chorizo, I got somewhere between 6-8 (don't recall) paper thin slices of, albeit great chorizo, for 8 bucks. It was good, but not *that* good.\\n\\n2. Then there was the pizza... this reminded me a lot of the kinds of pizzas I'd had in Naples. The pizza is so thin, eating it by folding is almost impossible. This is the kind of pizza which must be eaten by fork and knife.  \\n\\nThe pizza itself was very flavorful! it wasn't overly greasy, and the tomatoes actually tasted like high-quality, fresh tomatoes, as opposed to something out of a jar that's had the ever-loving processed out of it. Proportions were balanced too, and for the pizza being as thin as it is, the amount of crumbled sausage was not at all bad.\\n\\nMy gripe here is that it was not the pizza advertised. This was almost a hybrid of the Margherita and governatore. It had basil, but it was lacking in peppers and onions! Oops.\\n\\n3. When it came to dessert, there were two options, to which my friend said \\"you can't go wrong with chocolate cake. Regrettably, this place did. The cake was some mousse and two thick, dense, uninteresting chocolate \\"cookies.\\n\\nThe service was quick and efficient, although I will say they were perhaps a little too efficient. They took away the board that held the charcuterie a bit quick! There were still some of those delicious pickles on there. I could have said something, but it wasn't that big a deal. \\n\\nI'd also like to point out that the lighting is rather low (and if you are seated facing the bar, those lights are quick harsh relative to the atmosphere. Finally, you may end up sitting at a communal table.\\n\\nEven though 3 stars is less-than-stellar, this is still a great place!

Moreover, Kaki is changing the expectation of what fine Japanese dining in Atlanta is all about, proving that simple, elegant preparation can be every bit as sublime as the fussy creations of his competitors.\\n\\nNakato has two distinct personalities. Walking in, you'll see that on one side, there is a lively hibachi service. This area often hosts large groups (e.g. high school proms, birthdays, etc) and looks like lots of fun, though I've never eaten there. Then there's the sushi side, which has quiet tableside service overlooking a beautiful garden, as well as a sushi bar and several private back rooms that can be booked for an even more traditional experience. \\n\\nKaki was trained in Tokyo by Masahiro Yoshitake, of Sushi Yoshitake, which was awarded three Michelin stars in 2012. Each week, Kaki has unique offerings flown in, and this is the main reason why I'd strongly recommend letting Kaki handle the ordering (omakase) if you're sitting at the sushi bar. \\n\\nThe real artistry is in the way Kaki combines simple enhancements (often homemade) with the fish he serves. Kohada (gizzard shad, a type of herring) is marinated in a bit of salt and rice wine vinegar about 20 minutes before serving. Tai (sea bream) is served with freshly-ground sea salt and shiso leaf (a Japanese herb similar to mint, but with more depth). Chutoro (medium fatty tuna) is served with rice alone. In each case, the sushi is full of flavor, but the subtleties of the fish are permitted to come through. \\n\\nDuring our most recent meal, we started with a serving of seared chutoro (medium fatty tuna) over a broth of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic oil. The hint of garlic really enhanced the seared flavor, and the fish quality was outstanding.\\n\\nOur second course was a sashimi platter with maguro (tuna), suzuki (striped bass), and more chutoro (medium fatty tuna) all complemented by a serving of chopped aji (Spanish mackerel) served with the whole mackerel decoratively wrapped around the chopped fish. The mackerel would make a second appearance later in the meal, when we were served the fried bones as a chip-like snack. Kaki provided a bit of freshly-made wasabi with the sashimi, and this was the only course of our meal where we used a splash of soy sauce.\\n\\nNext up was our first hot course, a tempura of shishito pepper and ika (squid) seasoned with freshly ground sea salt and a bit of lemon.\\n\\nAfter the tempura, we were served broiled kampachi (amberjack) cheek, which was moist, tender, and delicious. A bit of a challenge to eat with chopsticks, but worth the effort.\\n\\nAfter that, it was on to nigiri, which has absolutely been the highlight of every experience I've had at Nakato. The courses were:\\n\\nTai (sea bream) with sea salt and shizo leaf\\nSuzuki (striped bass) brushed with house-made soy sauce\\nKohada (gizzard shad) marinated in rice vinegar and salt\\nAji (Spanish mackerel) with scallion\\nKampachi (amber jack)\\nStriped solo with house-made soy sauce and house-pickled ginger\\nChutoro (medium fatty tuna)\\nHouse-cured maguro (tuna) with shiso leaf and house-made soy sauce\\nKinmedai (golden eye snapper)\\nGrilled anago (saltwater eel) with Kaki's special 3-week eel-sauce reduction\\nIkura (salmon egg) roll with shiso leaf and scallion\\n\\nEach of these courses was excellent, with the gizzard shad, medium fatty tuna, golden eye snapper, and salmon egg roll standing out as particularly delicious. We ended the meal with some complimentary green tea, very full, and very happy. While not cheap, Nakato is a great value: the full-blown, no-holds-barred omakase service runs $50-80 per person before tax, tip, or drinks.\\n\\nIs Nakato the best sushi I've ever had? No. That honor belongs to the kaiseki service at Urasawa in Los Angeles, where my wife and I lived until last year. But on his best nights, Kaki can go toe-to-toe with very good sushi places along the West Coast or in New York. Considering that sushi in those markets is an ultra-competitive arena with dozens of great local suppliers, the fact that Kaki has created such an amazing oasis of quality sushi here in Atlanta is all the more astounding. \\n\\nFor Kaki, innovation isn't about building gargantuan rolls stuffed with \\"fusion\\" ingredients, or sprinkling truffle oil over toro and charging $40 for it (as the now-defunct MF Buckhead was fond of doing). Instead, Kaki is attempting to get back to the roots of traditional Japanese dining, and I get the sense that it's a journey which is just beginning. I encourage anyone who loves Japanese food to help support this movement (and have an amazing meal) by visiting the sushi bar at Nakato as often as possible."},{"name":"Standard Hall","address":"1100 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Only went for the bar on a Saturday night but it was so fun!!

Kinda reminds me of the original Kerby Lane on Kerby Lane, just a lot smaller and compact.  When you walk in the register, menu, and drinks are right there.  Just put in your order and pay right away.  I'm not a fan of paying up front at places that have waitstaff, but I'll just deal with it since the world doesn't revolve around moi. \\n\\nThey had a burger special going on (Tuesdays) - - $2 Regular Burgers (normally $4) and $3 for the other burgers (Bacon & Cheese, Nacho Burger, Salsa Verde Burger - normally $4.89).  Since I love choices and can sometimes be a pig (cut me some slack here - I just swam 50 laps on an empty stomach) I got the Regular and Nacho Burger.  The basket of fries ($1.89) looked good, but I opted to pass on the fried carbs.  \\n\\nYou put your order in, pay the man, get a number, then find a seat.  Several plasma TVs in this place to help keep you company.  My burgers came out pretty fast - I was impressed.  The Nacho Burger has jalapenos, queso, guacamole, and tortilla strips - a little messy but extremely tasty.  The Regular Burger comes with all the fixings, including mayo + mustard.  They're a bit smaller in size compared to what I'm used to - in fact, they actually fit in the palm of my hand (....I got big hands and size 11+ feet...!!!).  If I had to compare them to another burger I'd say they're a little more than half the size of The Jackalope's burgers (fu*k yeah!!).  \\n\\nThe buns must be homemade because they tasted damn good - a hint of sweetness and they were toasted.  My friend got the chips + queso + salsa which was superb and could easily make this a 5-star place.  The queso is some of the best I've ever had, and that verde salsa was awesome - a hint of lime w/ a relish-like consistency and a bit smokey too.  You definitely gotta try them, and I love the thick corn tortilla chips - served warm, similar to Matt's El Rancho but smaller in size.  \\n\\nI'll definitely go back - for that awesome queso + salsa, and the burger special is worth the discounted price regardless of the smaller size.

I will say that the five items of food/drink were all very good.  I'd give them 5 stars for that but the service was ridiculous.  We were sat at the sushi bar (which we wouldn't recommend and I'll tell you next) even though there were a few tables available but they were tables for 4 so they didn't want to waste them on a couple.  As far as the sushi bar, you order sushi from the sushi chefs and everything else from the waitress.  So we ordered a Sapporo and a specialty drink and they came along a bit slowly but ok.  The Geisha drink was pretty good, sweet but not candy sweet.  So then we ordered 2 miso soups and they arrived without spoons and we asked for spoons and the waitress advised she was getting them.  Seems to me to be a pretty obvious thing to accompany soup when being delivered instead of on a second trip.  So then we ordered three sushi rolls from one of the sushi chefs. The first roll was delivered by the sushi chef and he missed noticing that we had no soy sauce or wasabi.  We eventually got his attention and he whipped all of that up except the soy sauce.  I ended up grabbing it from a nearby table.  So then we noticed the second roll was handed off to another sushi chef who put it out for the servers to deliver out.  The first chef then grabbed it and put it in front of us as the two chefs were apparently confused.  We got done with the two rolls and while we waited for the third roll, noticed that we and another couple were the only people at the sushi bar.  We waited for the third roll, and waited and waited, while at the same time the neighboring couple kept being delivered dish after dish.  Finally i called over our waitress and advised her we were ready for our bill.  Only then did the sushi chef say something to the effect that he was going to make our third roll.  I cancelled it as we were tired of waiting and basically being ignored by their staff.

When I've dined in, the food here has been consistently par for the course. of course, we're talking about a geographical range that has pretty low standards for SE Asian food to begin with. Regardless, the Duck made the cut. Lately, however, their dishes have become increasingly bland and starch-centric. \\n\\nFirst off, BLAND: By my metric, the deliciousness of a dish, especially an Asian dish, is inversely proportional to how much hot sauce I have to add to it. I call this metric the \\"Sriracha Index\\", quantitated in negative squirts. The yellow curry we got in our last takeout order required 3 squirts of rooster sauce prior to full consumption. That's a -3 sqt, or in layman's terms, Hell-Naw-I-Did-Not-Pay-Thirteen-Dollars-For-This-Bland-Shit!!\\n\\nSTARCHY: With the takeout order, we also got noodles*. Because calling the glob of noodles topped with minced peanut Pad Thai would be an insult to SE Asian cuisine. I mean, it might be understandable if they skimp on the meat, but there was barely even any scallion! Its one redeeming quality was that it wasn't too sweet, which is my usual gripe about Thai food, but that was mainly because it lacked flavor in general. Which is fine, if it's a bowl of noodles, and not Pad Thai. No rooster sauce for the noodles. It was not a dish, it was something to be eaten with a dish.\\n\\n*I didn't want Pad Thai in the first place. The Foodler order was placed for Pad Thai Fried Rice. I wish I could say it was some verbal miscommunication over the phone, because then I would bust out my hilarious fake accents, but no, just gross incompetence.\\n\\nNow that I think about it, everything I eat really competes in a Mortal Combat-style duel with Sriracha. In this battle of the chillis, it's no contest: cock blocks duck. GAME OVER.

I liked the ahi and salmon but the shrimp was a little overcooked so I'll probably stick with just the salmon and tuna next time.\\n\\nTrue confession though, I came here mostly to try the dole whip.  I've never had a dole whip so I can't say if this is what you get at Disney or wherever else they make it, but it's good.

Alas, that is not the case, so I guess I'm rounding up to a 4.  Before I delve into my review, let me preface it with the fact that I ordered only two rolls and no sashimi.  So I may have missed out some stellar sashimi.  But I honestly highly doubt it based on the fish in my rolls.  Although Bamboo Sushi prides on the fact that they use fish caught via sustainable and eco-friendly means, I expected the fish to taste much more fresh.  I've had better sushi at other Japanese restaurants in PDX.  I ordered the MSC philly rolll, which tasted pretty bland.  However, the sushi chef recommended the Green Machine with albacore tuna and that was a winner.   If the chef never suggested it, I don't think I would have ordered it since the description seems a bit unassuming.  But the roll consists of a delicately tempura fried asparagus with avocado topped with albacore tuna and a cilantro sweet chili aioli.  It was scrumptious!  The tuna still didn't taste superb, but the combination of the other ingredients made it a really tasty roll.  \\n\\nServers were super friendly and attentive, which I really appreciated.  They checked on me quite often, which was nice.  You get a complimentary dish of edamame, which I thought was a nice touch.  The edamame was a bit stale and bitter tasting, but it's free, right?!   The house signature rolls, especially the fancy ones, are pricey.  Like upwards to $15 pricey.  I had two rolls and with tip, I spent $25.  Wowzers.  \\n\\nThe ambiance and interior of the restaurant is uber hip, trendy, and sleek.  I did take a look at their HH menu, which looked really promising.

Okay, I'm totally saying I do.\\n\\nAnyway, if you like to drink at 10am but also seek delicious breakfast fare to prevent you from getting weird looks from other patrons who are thinking, \\"why the hell is that looney drinking at 10am?\\" -- Daedalus is your place.\\n\\nCame here on a weekend for brunch with friends. We had an unconfirmed group size but they accommodated us gracefully, even when we all showed up at different times and spent a while catching up before ordering. \\n\\nMy aforementioned 10am drink was a pink grapefruit mimosa, which was pretty darn good. \\n\\nThe place was empty, which surprised me because I figured brunch would be hopping. Maybe the Harvard students were saving their pennies that weekend.. or afraid of snow.. or there was an alien abduction on campus the night before.. whatever the case may be (and my bet is the last one), it was very quiet. We got good attention but not overly pressuring. The table we were at was a nice, private booth-y near the bar and the bathroom upstairs. It could have easily seated several more, but it still felt intimate for the five of us that were there.\\n\\nMy food was really good -- I had the breakfast burrito and it was filling and healthy. Lots of fresh vegetables and the eggs were cooked perfectly well. My only complaint is it was SO hot when it was served and I wanted it so badly. I suffered second degree mouth burns to quell my growling tummy.\\n\\nOur whole crowd seemed to enjoy their breakfasts, even a self-proclaimed \\"picky\\" eater who got the steak and eggs. One friend got a dish with the refried beans, and as any good friend would do, I forked some off of her plate. HOLY SALT! Which is too bad, because they were the GOOD kind of refried beans that are nice and dark so you know they were made fresh not canned Old El Paso junkola. Seriously, I thought she had poisoned her beans as to prevent my thieving ways, but noooo, they actually came that way.\\n\\nOverall, we really enjoyed ourselves, the food, and the early morning adult beverages.

My boyfriend and I have tried a few places around Boston, and after trying Yasu it was our favorite.  \\n\\nYasu's dishes have the perfect combination of flavor and spiciness.  The side dishes that you get before your meal are very good, and plentiful.  We tend to eat them all, and they are always willing to re-fill them for us.  The location is great, and the restaurant has plenty of seating. \\n\\nMy favorite dish is the Tofu Kim Chi Bok Um.  My boyfriend's favorite is the Kim Chi Chi Gae.\\n\\nNow time for me to vent a little... lately it seems that the proportions are shrinking.  Every time we have gone recently, we have felt that our plates of food look much smaller than they have in the past.  My beloved Tofu Kim Chi Bok Um (which is a pork dish) has contained maybe 3-5 small pieces of pork.  What a disappointment!  My boyfriend noticed the last time we went that his soup bowl was not filled very high when he ordered his Kim Chi Chi Gae.  Shrinking proportions have not only been with food, but glasses of wine.  In the past they have always given us a generous pour.  At our last visit, the glass was much smaller with an undersized pour.  We felt so ripped off, we decided to order beer after that instead of wasting money on their wine. \\n\\nAlso, it seems that recently they are not timing the meal very well or they are trying to rush us (which makes no sense, it is never crowded).  At a Korean BBQ, the side dishes should come before your food.  Lately they have been arriving at the same time as our food.  What is the point if they arrive at the same time?

Everything on the ASSORTED SASHIMI PLATE ($17) was fresh, including the tuna and wild salmon. The PRAWN TEMPURA ($10) was nice and light, not greasy.\\n\\nThe OYSTER MISONNASE ($5.50) consisted of two small local oysters broiled on the half shell with some kind of miso mayonnaise. It was delicious, though extremely small, since they didn't use the larger pacific oysters, but rather small ones like Fanny Bay or Kumamoto, that you can also order raw.\\n\\nI was pleased to see that most of the menu consists of Nakamura's twist on ubiquitous J-restaurant items, which you'll find when you ask about unfamiliar item names. Oh, this one is just seafood sunomono with crab on top. Oh, that one is chicken katsu but with some ponzu sauce. And so on.\\n\\nLess impressive were the maki (rolls), but they were clean cut and reasonably priced. I just thought they were a little bland, but then I don't know what I was expecting from just salmon and avocado. \\n\\nNakamura is open for lunch and dinner, with what seems like a flexible closing time (i.e. depending on how busy they are).

Now, Imagine going to at a place with the same appellation, and these are the resounding feelings.\\n\\nThis was my fifth time going to Aquitaine, four times for dinner, and once for Sunday Brunch.  The food has been good on each and every occasion I've been there. \\n\\nLast night, we went out to Aquitaine mainly because of its location. I needed to go food shopping at Whole Foods so, it was convenient. However, this time; we had poor service. Our server, Rona, completely overlooked us. We were seated next to three other tables that she was serving, and I watched her attend to the customers with great care: She asked them if they wanted some fresh ground pepper, asked if they were happy with their meals, etc. Not once, after she brought us our dinner, did she even make an attempt to ask if we wanted fresh ground pepper, nor did she ask if everything was all right. She walked right by our table each and every time, and never bothered to ask if we were pleased. I could see if she was far away and was extremely busy and she forgot. But, from my observation, she simply didn't care, and it appeared (and still appears) to me it was deliberate. \\n\\nI sat there not feeling happy at all because I wasn't being treated the same way as other customers. I quickly lost my appetite, and only ate half of my dinner. Even though we sat there for a little while, with my plate half full, she didn't notice or even cared enough to question why I hadn't finished my food. \\n\\nShe did eventually come to our table and asked if we wanted dessert. By this time, I had already boxed my leftover and I very quietly said to her: \\"No, we don't want any dessert because you never bothered to come by and ask us how everything was. Initially,  I did want dessert, but now I've lost my appetite\\". I further said to her that I believed she deliberately ignored us. To which she replied, \\"No\\". \\n\\nUpon our arrival, she asked us, while holding a nine dollar bottle of water, if we wanted some water, to which I said no. I asked her if they had filtered water, and she said, \\"Yes\\". So, I asked for a glass of filtered water. I, for one, don't believe in pushing a nine dollar bottle of water on the customers. If the food is good, just go with that. I also didn't notice that any of the customers she was serving, had purchased the nine dollar bottle of water either, yet they were not mistreated. \\n\\nThen I thought, perhaps she's treating us this way because we were wearing jeans, but guess what: Some of the other customers were also wearing jeans. \\n\\nWe ordered the escargots braised  ($10.95)  in white wine served with shallots,  parsley, and butter for an appetizer, followed by the steak au poivre: ($37.95)  beef tenderloin in a cognac-green peppercorn cream  served with grilled scallions and  potato  gratin, and the miso honey-glazed salmon ($26.95) served with  a sweet potato and kale hash, and lime citronette.  Everything was delicious, especially the escargots, which were bursting with flavor. \\n\\nThe food would have been more palatable if our server showed some interest in our dining experience. I equate the experience with going to eat at a friend's house who is less than gracious. Then, in the end, asks if you want dessert and you think, \\"No, I just want to get the heck out of here. Sort of like Billy Crystal's character in the Princess Bride. \\"Why don't you give me a paper cut and pour some lemon juice on it\\".   That is how I felt. \\n\\nI give Aquitaine a three star because the food is very good. Had the service been up to par with everything else, I would have given them a four star.

I would order this again, but it's super over-priced; 10 smallish slices for 10.95 or so. \\n\\nThey are one of two Asian food joints in this little shopping village so of course there were 10,000 Asian folks waiting to get in or busy shoveling noodles here. I didn't have to wait long, and they get you some steaming flowery tea right away. The congee is okay, not worth the 10+ dollars I paid for it, and the waitress who transported it got her thumb stuck in it while putting it down. Maybe that's why I got diarrhea after? Anyway, too much information...\\n\\nMy dining partner had the marinated chicken with rice but that was a dish where you could enjoy the beauty of bones. Not a lot of meat and the marinade was uneventful. We had to order the pork because both of us felt like we had just eaten appetizers. \\n\\nThe cashier-overseer lady has a serious case of resting b_tchface. When I went up to pay and pointed out my table, she barked, \\"Yeah, I know!\\" (regarding the table, not the RBF). She told me it was self-serve tea but then when I tried to self-serve, a waitress ran up said said \\"I HELP YOU, OKAY!\\" Okay...\\n\\nAlso, reports are true, they take the tip ahead of time and it says so on the receipt, but you expect to be able to gauge your service level.

It was my first Ramen experience, and I would definitely go back. I had the miso ramen, and it was great! The food came out super fast, our waitress was great. I really have only good things to say about the food and service. I look forward to trying more on the menu.\\n\\nThat being said, I was surprised to learn that they don't let you take any food home. I understand a \\"No Take Out\\" rule, but as a customer, I was not happy to learn that I couldn't bring the rest of my food home, especially given the large portion. I could only eat half my ramen bowl, so I was pretty disappointed to be told no when I asked to package the rest of it up. I totally get wanting to cut costs, but having a few to-go containers on hand would really prevent me from feeling mildly disrespected as a customer. I would love to try more of the menu, but I don't want to try a few different things, then have to leave it there-- and Ramen bowls aren't exactly something you want to share. If I paid for it, I should be able to take it home.\\n\\nWhich is a good segway to my thoughts that it was slightly overpriced. $12 seemed a little steep. It's not a high enough price for me to not return-- I plan to return -- but it just felt a little high. \\n\\nMy final related note is that I wish there were more vegetarian options. The bowls would have been just as good without the meat, and thus I feel like it should be priced lower if you got it without meat (e.g. miso bowl, no meat), like the way many restaurants do with salads (add chicken for $3, etc). I really liked my food, but didn't want meat in it. Just a simple tweak to the menu and pricing that I think would be an improvement.\\n\\nI will definitely return though!"},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We had dinner Saturday night.

It's super casual and has free wifi and plenty of tables and space to work at. The line to order baked goods and ice cream were kind of counterintuitive but negligable. It was kind of crazy how expensive some of the things were (namely the Chocolate Covered Strawberries at $2 a pop), but we were okay with the price since we were expecting something great. After sitting down on the patio overlooking the water, we got to eating, and were a little disappointed. The Chocolate Covered Strawberries were nothing special, and my Honey Lavender Cupcake, while moist and pretty good, tasted basically like a honey saturated cake with not even a hint of lavender.

I'm an engineer and spent a long time trying to figure out their system and left without having figured it out. The guy kept moving the boxes from one stack to another, oftentimes removing boxes from the middle of a stack and moving it to the opposite side of the kitchen. It hardly matter though since the bottleneck is the amount of oven space they have (in case you were wondering).

Some are aggressively spicy, yet others are conservatively mild.  Some have thick and meaty curry sauce (as in stew) while others have thin, souplike sauce.  Saying that all Japanese curries are such and such is akin to saying that all American hamburgers should be this and that.\\n\\nThe Japanese curry served here is a very fine rendition and representation of light, thin curry sauce variety with a mild kick.  I believe the owner's aim is to create a curry dish that is healthy as well as tasty and he has accomplished this task well.  Remember that most Japanese consider Japanese curry as \\"comfort food,\\" but rarely consider it to be a healthy food.  Thus, I commend the owner for creating a healthy alternative without compromising the taste nor comfort level of the dish.  The sauce is high in vegetable content and low in animal fat...it is as if someone came up with a healthy hamburger that is also delicious.\\n\\nI also love the Czech Pilsner beer sold here...it is nice to drink beer that is not overly hoppy like most of the ales and beers sold in the Portland area.

But Granny gave me a gift card for Xmas so.........\\n\\nI will say that the only reason they're getting 3 stars is because the burgers and fries were good....perfectly cooked juicy meat and crispy fries but that's where the compliments end. When we walked in the hostess greeted us and then disappeared for about 2 minutes to clean off a table. Only 1/3 of the restaurant was even occupied....like they were purposely seating all customers in one section. Ok, I get it, but if you're gonna do that shouldn't you have the tables clean and ready to go so customers don't have to wait when it's not even busy @ 8pm. Then the server (Raven, per the receipt) came over and she has to be one of the worst servers I've ever had. I wanted a beer...asked for a Sierra. Oh, they're out of both kinds of Sierra listed on the menu. Ok, how about a Blue Moon. Oh, they were outta that too. At this point, as a server, knowing your tip is dependent on service, shouldn't you suggest an alternate that you do have available. Nope, she just stared at me for a good minute until I said ok, just water. When she brought the beverages we ordered the southwestern egg rolls. About 7 minutes later a different person brought them out. Then about 5 minutes after that (when the appetizer was almost gone) Raven comes out and says she's been waiting in the kitchen for 5 minutes for our app to come out and no one told her they were taking it out. Well, isn't it your responsibility to know what's happening with your tables?!?! And if you thought we were still waiting on our app why wouldn't you communicate to your customer....and then you would have seen we already had it. We then order our burgers and they came out in a short amount of time after that so I assume the kitchen was on top of their game but the server was to busy hanging with her friend at another table and looking at her phone to do her job. She was also very impatient.....not even waiting for a reply to the \\"you need anything else\\" question before walking away.....the one time she asked it.

Right when you step in the door it just feels like a fun and inviting place to hang out with friends.  They have a pretty great selection of cured meats and cheeses, and our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful in providing some great recommendations.  Since the charcuterie is really the star of the show I would recommend coming in for lunch if possible, when you'll get a much better deal on their combo boards.  In fact my biggest complaint is that, during dinner hours, the cheese and charcuterie is ONLY available a la cart, which makes it almost twice as expensive to get a comparable sampling.  For that reason, my friend and I ended up ordering their signature \\"Salty Pig\\" pizza to share, which incorporated at least 3-4 of their meats as toppings and cost about the same as just two of the meats alone would have done.  This may seem nitpicky, but for the budget-conscious it's definitely worth considering.\\n\\nAfter all that mental math we ended up with an amazingly delicious pizza.  (Well, it was more of a round flatbread than a pizza technically, but delicious nevertheless.)  The meats were really excellent, and were even elevated by the oils and cheeses, slightly bitter greens, and other toppings of the pizza.\\n\\nThe wine selection was also pretty good.  I really loved that they had some dry fino sherry on offer, which goes so well with these kinds of salty foods, and is not too common on most menus.

Their service was very good and I left a very nice tip for that reason.\\n\\nSecond, food.  Some of the food was very good - for example, the meyer lemon sorbet was very nice.  Too often lemon sorbets are made only from the juice and are over-sweetened at that.  This one had a very nice balance of acid, sweetness and bitterness from the peel.  I appreciated that.  The beignets were also very well executed, and I'm not even much of a sweets person.  Some of the food was not. But for the six-course whim menu, I was served:\\n\\nSome sort of fish that was amuse-buche sized. - tasty \\n\\nSmelts  - which I love, but there were only 3\\n\\nGigantic asparagus spears with a lightly-poached egg - this dish could have used seasoning and a thicker-yolked egg, perhaps a duck egg instead of a chicken one\\n\\nA pasta with ragu - this was good, but the pasta flavor overpowered the ragu, which is impressive in a way, but maybe not in a good way.  And the pasta on the edges were stone cold, which was a disappointment.\\n\\nSome sort of rolled-up chicken on a baby-food-like bed of something - this dish was hotel-restaurant quality.  I had a similar dish at the now-closed 2-Michelin-starred Ria in Chicago that was mind-blowingly good, but this one was boring and executed only moderately-well\\n\\nLemon sorbet - this was the best lemon sorbet I've ever had\\n\\nBeignets - these were very good\\n\\nKitchen: I know a whim menu will be less predictable than a fixed one, but it was kind of an odd collection and order to the food, everything from the sizing to the content didn't seem to flow well.  Also, I wasn't expecting to be there over 2 hours for a 6-course meal.

So, average 2 stars. If you're looking for traditional Mexican dishes like chili verde or carnitas, forget it. They have tried to add a contemporary flare to the food with marginal success. The waitress told me that the special was absolutely incredible (some kind of chimichanga with carne asada in it) only to return to the table 5 minutes later to tell me they were out of it. So, I got the Yucat√°n, which included two carne asada tacos and a burrito. Again, the food was mediocre. What stands out about this place more than anything else is how unbelievably loud it is!  To frame this properly, I will tell you that I enjoy listening to my own music very loud. I will also disclaim that I don't have gray hair! When I say that it's difficult to hear in the restaurant, I'm not talking about an intimate dinner conversation on a date. It's so loud that I had to have the waitress come stand right next to me and speak into my ear to explain the specials. We asked to be re-seated in the outside area, which was better, but it was still uncomfortably loud with house music blasting throughout the restaurant. I'll add that this was on a Wednesday night. There is a DJ on site spinning records, and he apparently wants to make sure everybody could hear him!

Pok Pok NW is a bummer on all fronts. For some reason, I thought this was supposed to be the more \\"upscale\\" location, but you wouldn't know that by dining here. The service was very bad, as in I felt that my mere presence was an inconvenience. I'm a chill, no-allergies-no-substitutions-eat-whatever-you-put-in-front-of-me kinda gal, but my request for a clean fork was met with an eye roll (I'm not kidding). \\n\\nI can overlook bad service if the food is off the hook, but it wasn't. I ordered the Kaeng Hang Leh, a sweet pork curry, and the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\", a rice noodle salad with fried catfish (I have had this dish in Vietnam by the name of Cha Ca Thang Long, I believe, so I'm familiar with how it's typically prepared). The curry was weird. It was like 80% pork fat sitting on top of an over spiced sludge. I think it'd been sitting on the stove for too long, but every bite coated my mouth in thick grease. The Cha Ca was okay, but the sauce it comes with is all wrong. Traditionally, this dish is served with a sauce called Mam Nem, and it's this wonderful, stinky fermented fish sauce. That's what I was expecting, but what I got was this sour, yellow, bile-tasting goop. It was super acidic and not fishy at all. I should have tried it beforehand, as it comes on the side in a little ramekin. Like a fool, I poured the whole thing in and ruined the whole dish. \\n\\nI got two drinks, the tamarind whiskey sour (just what it sounds like) and the lord bergamot (an earl grey infused vodka drink), and both were decent but for the price (twelve dollars, I think), I expected something more innovative. I think that's the takeaway here. I was hoping Pok Pok NW would be an opportunity for something cool and new from Chef Ricker, but I was disappointed to find that it's the same old stuff, and it feels tired. Most of the dishes at the NW location have sadly been ripped from the OG menu, so unfortunately it's more of the same old, same old mediocre fare. There are so many excellent restaurants in this city, both new and old, that I left feeling like my money would have been better spent somewhere else."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place used to be great.

I think the waitress went around the whole restaurant twice before taking my order and after she took my order, it took what felt like decades to get my bill. The chorizo was undercooked and had a strange taste, the homefries were just plain bad, I can't even point out specifics because it was just insanely inedible.

There is usually a ride or two that are under repair but you can find that information before you head to the park if you need to know. \\n\\nThe decision on what combination of park(s) and number of days will be a personal preference but I think that one day per park makes sense with the most attractive being a two(or three)-day, park-to-park ticket.\\n\\nFrom the CityWalk you can branch to either the entrance to Islands of Adventure or the entrance to Universal Studios.

It was better before the city made them remove their community seating out front. And this isn't their fault and I suppose it comes with the territory,but the bums, train kids, falling out junkies, are such a stain on places like this. Its almost like, wanna eat at the porter? ..yes ok lets suit up bring your self defense, and best wits."},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Visited on a Saturday evening for dinner and drinks. We actually had planned on going the Schmidt's, but it was a two hour wait, so we decided to try Old Mohawks, and I am really glad we did. The pub's atmosphere is fantastic and the service was excellent. We were seated right away, despite the time and the small space.  \\n\\nI got the crab cakes dinner, which was ok, but my bf got the bratworst dinner and it was deelicious - I highly recommend it (use the tartar sauce).

It was a tall table with the view of the stage. We had a nice waitress, she got our drinks and we knew what to order since this wasn't our first time at the restaurant.\\n\\nTo start off, she gave us some soda bread and an oily and sweet and alcoholic tasty dipping sauce.\\n\\nWe ordered the scallop forest (something close to this). It was basically 6 perfectly fried scallops with 2 dipping sauce. The first sauce was a mayo lime which was creamy and citrusy to help cut the oiliness of the fried scallops. And the last sauce was a sweet chile sauce which reminds me of the Thai sweet child sauce. I love both sauce equally! This is a MUST when you are at Ragland road! \\n\\nFor the entree, I got the lambo. The lamb shank was falling off the bone goodness! The mash potato was buttery and silky. I could just eat the potato by itself. There is also the broth... Without this broth the dish would have been dry and lacking something. The liquid tied the whole dish together! It was perfect! \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the steak. Honesty, it was disappointing! It lacked flavored.. Where was the salt and pepper? He asked for medium rare and the steak came out rare. Which was okay for him. The dish needed some sauce. Well there was a green sauce but not enough. My boyfriend did not enjoy his meal. \\n\\nLastly, for dessert. Everything looked good on the dessert menu. The one that caught our eyes was Ger's bread pudding. It came out in a tea cup with a couple of golden raisins on top and 2 different sauces on the side. The sauce was sooooo good! I was just licking my plate after. It was a salty caramel sauce and a vanilla creme sauce. You have to use both sauce on the bread pudding to get an explosion of flavor. Sweet, salty, and creamy favor!  \\n\\nI would give 4 star for the customer service.\\nAnd 3.5 for the food because the steak wasn't good at all! \\n\\nUpdate with the reservation situation: a staff approach us asking how everything was and etc. my boyfriend brought up that we waited 40 minutes but our reservation was at 5:45pm and we felt ignore. The staff assured us that it was probably because those patrons probably had an earlier appointments etc. It was nice that they reassured us. However, they should work on the pagers being buzzed at the same time to prevent traffic congestion up front!"},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Daedalus-- 4 stars during spring or summer, 2 during winter... The main attraction here is the rooftop deck. During a nice night, this is a great place to grab a couple of beers and enjoy the atmosphere and the view. The food here is pretty standard pub fair. It's fine, but not spectacular. The cocktails can be a little disappointing. As compared to the other bars in the Harvard Square area (Grafton, Russel House, Park, Beat Hotel) I think Daedalus loses as far as food and drinks are concerned, but is the only one to offer an extensive outdoor terrace. It's a mainstay if you find yourself in the Harvard area during the summer.

Checked into the hotel, unpacked a bit, and then headed out to the first breakfast place that popped up on Yelp - the ABC. Lemme tell ya, we were not disappointed in the slightest.\\n\\nWAIT:\\nOur group of 8 people arrived around 7:30 on a Friday morning. We had read about long waits for breakfast and were prepared for a line, but were pleasantly surprised when we were told that we would be seated as soon as all the members of our party were present.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nHonestly, anything would've tasted good after a long night of traveling on a fairly empty stomach. BUT, the ABC gave us a soul food experience that literally awoke us (both literally and figuratively) to what it means to be fed in the South. Being from California, we were all used to acai bowls, avocado toast, and kale smoothies for breakfast... all of which seems as appealing as eating construction paper after THIS breakfast food.\\n-Southern breakfast: GREAT! Good if you want something hearty to get your day started. The grits, eggs, and turkey bacon were all good, but the homemade biscuit brought the plate to a whole new level. Buttery, flaky, and absolutely heavenly. I would've eaten seven.\\n-Peach cobbler french toast: Several people at our table ordered this and loved it. From what I nibbled on, it was definitely on the sweeter side, but everyone's raves proved that it was worth the calories. A pleasant dessert x breakfast collaboration. \\n-Chicken and waffles: Can't come here and not get them. Literally made my half asleep friend perk up and exclaim \\"DAMN THAT'S GOOD\\" upon taking the first bite. Exceptional waffle and fantastic fried chicken = amazing chicken and waffles. (Sorry, Roscoe's, you'll have to step aside for this one.)\\n-Sweet tea: I'm not from the South so I may not be the best judge for sweet tea, but I liked it! I think it was on the sweeter side, but definitely nothing too overwhelming and a good way to brighten your morning.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nWould've given this place 5 stars, but the service left just a little something to be desired. Maybe it's because we came fairly early in the morning, but our waitress was a bit on the sassy side... Nothing outright rude, but maybe just not the \\"southern hospitality\\" that we experienced at other places. However, on the way out, we ran into a really nice guy who apparently ran the Instagram who struck a quick convo with us - nice way to end the meal. \\nPS: We were all a bit confused when we noticed that our check had already added an 18% service charge. We were a bit unsure of whether or not we were expected to tip on top of that in case the service charge was added because we had a larger party. A quick search on the internet told us that an additional tip wasn't necessary. \\n\\nOVERALL: \\nDo not skip if you're in the area. One of those places that you'll regret not visiting if you end up seeing it on Yelp or Instagram later on. Food is fantastic and everything that I ever hoped and dreamed of in a southern breakfast."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes!! Amazing Japanese curry! Best Japanese food I've had yet in Portland. \\n\\nRecently moved up here from Southern California and was homesick for good, authentic Japanese food, which is easy to find in my old neighborhood but has been a hit or miss (well, only misses so far) here in Portland for me. Then came Kale...delicious Kale. Thank you Kale for the home cooked comfort food I was craving.\\n\\nThe menu may only have main items, but with quality of what they're offering, I don't think they need anything else. Kale curry is better than the one I make at home (the packaged cube stuff) or the curry my parents made me growing up. It's even better than some curry that I've had in Japan. I tried a bite of the Doria and will definitely be getting it next time. Who knew cheese and Japanese curry could go together so well? Kale does! and it's totally worth the extra wait.\\n\\nFood is excellent, prices are very reasonable and the staff was helpful and friendly.

Everything in the restaurant has been imported from Italy.  Everything?  Yes, everything.  They imported their brick ovens, all of their fresh ingredients, they import the water from Sicily, and they also brought over some talented pizza chefs from Italy.  This place is outstanding.  The real McCoy.  Remember: Bring your own booze.  They do not have alcohol for you, so bring your favorite bottle of wine.  You stand in a short line to order, then fight with all the other patrons for a prime seat.  This part is not my favorite,but it has not deterred me from visiting several times.  The pizza will be ready in about 5 minutes.  The reason for the community/fight for your table environment makes perfect business sense.  After all, serving pizzas as quickly as they do, they want to make sure they can serve as many customers in a night as possible.

Honestly, had read about this place, but had never been and had never heard anything superlative or overly negative. \\n\\nTo start, the atmosphere is great if you are into a comfortable hunting lodge-like setting. There's a large fire pit centrally located, comfortable booths throughout and high, wood-accented ceilings. The variety of high gravity beer is great for a small-batch, on-site brewer, and my wife and I kind of got stuck on one beer - the Pepe Le Pew de Saison. Yup, the name gave me pause, but one sip had me wanting to buy a keg to bring home. \\n\\nThe waiter we had was accommodating and knowledgeable about their beer selections, but service overall was a bit slow. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have anywhere we had to be, so it was fine, and it wasn't ridiculously long either. Just somewhat slow. \\n\\nThe food was good - somewhat unique, and prepared as described, but not over the top excellent. It's essentially upscale bar food that is prepared with some unusual ingredients that are locally grown and promised to be fresh as a slap in the face on a cold winter day. The greens are definitely fresh and we quizzed our waiter on the meat and he was able to tell us when and from where each was delivered.\\n\\nI ordered the antelope patty melt, which is exactly as it sounds. Antelope is similar in taste and texture to venison, which can vary depending on who and how it is processed. My burger was a little tough (it's easy to overcook venison, too), but the mix of the meat with the onions, cheese and toasted bread was great - especially pared with our new favorite beer. \\n\\nMy wife and daughter split a roasted beet salad and a lemon chicken salad sandwich and were quite happy. My wife seemed to enjoy the salad more than my daughter - remarking how fresh everything tasted.  I don't remember exactly what my two other kids ordered, but I recall a plate heaped high with very tasty sweep potato fries. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a good experience - good enough that my wife and I dined at the Roswell location for Valentine's Day weekend (very busy). That will be in a different review, but suffice it to say that the spent grain beer bread is SO worth the $1 a loaf. We ordered a few extras to bring home with us :-). Also, the beers at each restaurant are different, which is a bit disappointing since we like the Pepe le Pew so much."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Woke up Sunday with a hangover worse than I have felt in some time.  I was concerned with how I was going to find lunch, as I could barely walk, let alone drive.  Then my mom called and asked me out to lunch around 3pm.  Since I awoke at 1:30pm, this was acceptable.  She picked me up and we headed over to Barcelona.\\n\\nWe arrived shortly after 3pm.  My mom opted against valet and parked her car in the N. Highland Steel parking garage.  We entered Barcelona.  I told the hostess I required inside, air-conditioned seating and as we walked to the table my Mom forlornly eyed the packed outside seating, contrasting it negatively with the sparsely occupied inside seating.  My headache took no prisoners, so we sat down and reviewed the menus.  Our waitress, Chelsea, came over and asked if we were interested in the 1/2 off wine bottles?  My Mom, her eyes as full of hope as a child at Christmas, asked if ALL bottles were 1/2 off.  Chelsea said yes, and like the Grinch I informed my Mom she could order whatever she wanted, but I was getting a water and a Coke.  She had an hour to drive, so she settled on a regularly priced Yuengling.\\n\\nI ordered a Bacon Basket, and the Goat Cheese and Chorizo Crepes.  My Mom, who is the only person I've ever known who has a salmon fetish (if a Shell gas station offered a salmon entree free with a fill-up, she would eat it), ordered the Scottish Smoked Salmon.  While we waited, I avoided personal conversation by perusing the inside of the restaurant.  I don't know if 3pm is a slow time or if Barcelona is one of those rare places where people enjoy their jobs, but I was amazed by the number of dancing waiters I saw.  I hadn't seen this much ballroom dancing since I took ballroom dancing classes with an ex-girlfriend.  This wasn't a show for the patrons (the ones at the bar seemed to not notice the dancing), it was just being happy and caught up in the beat of the music.  Weird and great.\\n\\nWhile we waited for our food, I was pleasantly surprised that my water glass was never empty.  It was refilled about 5 times by Chelsea, other waiters, and two managers (I suppose? they didn't wear the waiter uniform).  Our food took longer than normal to come out (20-30 minutes), but one of the managers came to our table to explain and apologize for the wait.  I firmly believe more managers should do this, as it immediately defused my Mom (I hadn't noticed, as I was entranced by the dancing waiters / extremely hungover / working hard at avoiding my Mom).\\n\\nWhen the food arrived, I dug into the Bacon and Crepes.  What rich heaven.  The 10 pieces of bacon justified the $5.50 price, as they were varied but all good - seemed like two varieties of bacon with some pieces medium cooked, some almost burned but not quite.  This bacon was rather salty, which satisfied my need (3 more cups of water, please!) but needs to be noted.  As for the Crepes....  I normally don't order Crepes, but these made me wish I did.  Basically a LOT of goat cheese wrapped in pastry with the sweet additionn of plentiful figs.  I don't know how the chorizo came into play, but whatever the concoction, it worked.  I ate an entire crepe before I thought I would pass out, and decided to save the other crepe and some bacon for later.  Mom enjoyed her salmon and offered me some about 14 times, but I didn't want to disturb the taste of the Crepes with salmon, so resisted.  She enjoyed it so much she left nothing behind.\\n\\nChelsea returned with the bill, and Mom asked about the recipe for the Crepes so she could make some.  I suppose Chelsea ignored the creaking sound my eyes made as they rolled in my head, for she returned a few moments later with the Barcelona cookbook with the recipe for the Crepes in it.  I hope my Mom left Chelsea a great tip, as she deserved it, as she gave me a wonderful idea for a Christmas present.  \\n\\nSo, an amazing time.  Because of the alignment of Mars and Venus and Jupiter?  Because it was 3:30pm on a Sunday?  Because of the dancing waiters?  Because Chelsea was a professional on her \\"A\\" Game (my Mom didn't notice but I did that she looked stressed when she wasn't at our table, but smiled and interacted cheerfully with us)?  Don't know, don't care.  I've learned in life to just say Thank You when things work well.\\n\\nThank you, Barcelona."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],L={key:0},H={key:1};function D(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(N,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-b0ae7527"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/12.md","filePath":"people/12.md"}'),G={name:"people/12.md"},V=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
