This area is borderline sketchy, which is the reason I had not stopped earlier, but 100+ review on Yelp is always reassuring that people are frequenting this place.\\n\\nNicks To-Go's building is nothing to brag about. It appears to be some former warehouse type structure with Nicks To-Go painted on one side. Nicks To-Go has a free dirt lot parking that you can access from Martin Luther King Drive. Be careful when pulling in with low clearance vehicles as the lot and the entrance could use some resurfacing. There are no markings so patrons just parks in a haphazard fashion. Being take-out only (they have some picnic benches outside though), they have high parking space turnover, and so finding a parking spot will probably not be an issue.\\n\\nIn the front of the building is a small non air-conditioned room where you place your order. The order area room has a lot of old scenic pictures of Greece from a Greek calendar, a map of Greece, and a menu attached to the wall. The male owner taking the orders can come across as a bit abrasive, but this is a common theme in these type establishments.\\n\\nI ordered the Nicks  burger (a burger with lettuce, onions, ketchup, and mustard) for $3, added cheese for 25 cents, and then made it a combo (thick cut fries and a \`16 oz. diet coke) for ~$6.75. I paid cash because I figured a place such as Nicks To-Go was probably cash only. However, the person after me paid with credit card, but I have no idea what cards they accept. I realized that I made a mistake when they told me it would take about 10 minutes to prepare the burger, when they were turning out gyros much quicker.\\n\\n At first it was unclear how I would know that my order was ready, as I got no order #. Eventually I realized that they just stated the order (i.e 2 gyros and a fry, etc.). Some people returned to their car to wait for their order, but be careful as they will not bring the food to you and you may miss them calling your order, as they have no intercom. They have two spots to pick up the order, the ordering room or this side window fronting the parking lot. \\n\\nSo, let's talk about the food. The fries were not bad. They were a little over salted but crispy and fresh. The diet coke was a diet coke, hard to screw that up. However, the Nicks burger was just average. It was sort of small and reminded me of a burger that I would get at a high school sporting event. The bun was flaky and not fresh. They overcooked the meat to well done, probably to avoid anyone suing them for food poisoning, but it takes the flavor out of the meat. The toppings were your typical low grade grocery-store offerings.  \\n\\n I noticed that most people ordered the gyros; and in hindsight now that I know that the owners are Greek, I am going to give them another try and order the gyros next time. The burger is not their specialty."},{"name":"Rustic Kitchen","address":"210 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We held our wedding rehearsal dinner here in their Atrium room - it was fantastic!

The signature dishes for the food competition were some utterly fantastic chicken and waffles, and an excellent Fried Macaroni and Cheese.\\n\\nThe Chicken and Waffles was the best I have ever had. Chicken that easily is comparable to the famous recipe of Chik-fil-A but superior. Waffles that are crispy on the outside, golden brown and fluffy on the inside with a marvelous flavor. AND a syrup that is not screwin' around. It was terminally delicious. If you have never tried the southern phenomenon of Chicken and Waffles, please do yourself a favor and go here first. so you can see how it is done. Before you let any sucker-pants line cook at Waffle House poison your mind with some sad-ass, punk, floppy-waffle with dry, vapidly breaded crap-O-chicken. For real people. This is the glorious way that God intended for chicken to be served with waffles and you can take that to church on Sunday and go tell it on the mountain! Every time she sells one, Jesus himself laments the wait til his second coming when he can finally have some. \\n\\nAs for the fried Macaroni and cheese, well...On Tuesday at the very start of Truck By TruckWest, the estimable folks at 'Hand Helds' presented their version of this appetizer/side-dish and it was a fair entry. Good but perhaps not remarkably good in my opinion. Now tonight, on Thursday, this fine woman's down-home, stick to your ribs, version was expertly crisped to a beautiful crunchy, delicious shell all around on the outside, which through some culinary mastery still remained fully creamy, separated and delicious on the inside. The macaroni, unlike at so many other places who dare to attempt this dish, DID NOT clump together and dry out the cheese sauce a little bit to form unfortunate texture lumps at all, but rather maintained and astoundingly fresh-from-the-stirred-pot flow and flavor of rich, creamy cheese and soft but firm noodles that only the loving art of the kitchen taken to it's mastery could hope to achieve.\\n\\nExtremely good show!

The bar at Bistro Niko seems to be a very popular happy hour spot.\\n\\nI'll start with the positives, the food at Bistro Niko is very good. It's not especially creative and I thought it was all heavy on the butter. But it's classy French cafe style. \\n\\nMy wife and I both ordered cocktails to start, a Martini for me (gin, not too dry, up, with a twist), a French 76, a concoction of lemon, vodka, champagne and hibiscus, for her. These were both stellar. I can understand the popularity of the bar. (Side note: I'm usually hesitant to order a Martini out, since usually I'll get a glass of cold watery vodka at best and asked \\"What flavor? Our choco-rasba-tinis are delish\\" at worst. But Bistro Niko delivered the goods). \\n\\nFor appetizers we tried the gougeres and a fried oyster appetizer. The gougeres tasted exactly like Cheezits, in a good way. They were light, puffy and rich. They'd go great with a cold Lager. The oysters were the best thing all night. Among the best fried oysters I have ever had, perfectly crispy and salty outside, creamy and sweet inside. They were accompanied by some interesting pickles and a nice remoulade.\\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the lamb chops and skate wing. I was pleased with both, but not particularly impressed. Both were technically excellent; proper doneness, nice color on the outside, and well seasoned. The accompaniments were forgettable. The entrees were good, but there was nothing special about them, I could have gotten the same dish at any number of restaurants around town (mostly less expensive places) Bland, slightly undercooked fingerling potatoes with both, average creamed spinach with the skate and decent Brussels' sprouts with the lamb. My overall impression pf both plates was that they were trying to compensate for a lack of quality and creativity with copious amounts of butter. (It's French, what did I expect?)\\n\\nThe desserts were all standard French sweets. We got cream puffs, called \\"profiteroles\\" on the menu. They were good, but so are the ones in the freezer section of your local Kroger.\\n\\nI was pretty disappointed in Bistro Niko's service. In my past experiences with the Buckhead Life Group I've been mostly impressed with the quality of service, but Bistro Niko isn't up to par. Our server was friendly and helpful. I think he just had too many tables, I counted at least seven that he was serving, one was a party of eight. In this quality of restaurant, with the individualized attention and service required, seven is too many tables. Taking custom drink orders, discussing the wine list, describing specials all take time. So, while he was excellent when he was at our table the visits were too few and too far between. Because of that, the timing of our meal was all off, we waited quite a while with no drinks at the beginning of the meal. When we finally received our cocktails, we were nearly done with them before the appetizers arrived. Then the entrees came before we'd really had a chance to eat the appetizers. Once the entrees were cleared, the wait for dessert menus was noticeably lengthy. A few specific notes of poor service: \\n\\nWhen I ordered my cocktail the server looked at me and said \\"Charles Dickens?\\" and then just stared at me for an awkward moment waiting for me to get the joke (\\"Olive er twist?\\"). I guess I should have heard that one before. \\n\\nWhen he brought our entrees, the runner said to my wife \\"hot plate\\". What they say in a $6 Mexican restaurant. For a $30 entree, at least give me a \\"Ma'am this plate is very warm, please be careful\\", or better yet, re-plate it after it comes out of the salamander so it's not an issue. \\n\\nOne instance, our water carafe was empty, so the busser grabbed the one of the adjacent table to fill our glasses. I just found this odd. If something is set on your table their is a sense of ownership over it. I know at 99% of casual restaurants we're all being filled from the same pitcher and yes it was just water and it's free... But he wouldn't have taken the bread basket off the adjacent table to refill ours. Also, we were offered sparkling or still water, how was he to know that we didn't have still and they sparkling or vice-versa?\\n\\nThe final thing that irked me was that we had a Buckhead Life gift card with a large balance on it. Well more than enough to cover the full meal. However, Bistro Niko wouldn't put the tax or tip on the card. I was thinking maybe this is a law that I'm not aware of? But thinking back I've had gift cards to Chili's, etc, and this has never been an issue before. I didn't mind having to pay the tax and tip, but I'm sure the person who gave it to me expected to be giving me a nice meal (or two), not part of a meal and an obligation for $50 in tax and tip."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went here with a bigger group (7) for beers and dinner.

My biggest issue with our experience was not that we waited for 50 minutes despite being told 20, but that we were lied to about being seated shortly and that during our 50 minute wait they decided to seat small parties in tables that could've easily been combined to fit our party.

Jack Allen's gets a 5-star on the food. Sadly, it gets a 1.5 stars on service and atmosphere. We went at 5:30 on a Saturday, which to us doesn't seem to be peak time for dinner, but the whole place oozed a sort of snobbyness that really shouldn't come from a restaurant that boasts hamburgers and chicken-fried-whatever as their top menu selections.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was the valet parking stand as we walked in from our parking spot 15 feet away from it. Seriously, this place is next to a Sonic, do they really need valet parking? Isn't that just a ploy to get some extra tip money?\\n\\nThen when we walk in, we were told it will be a 20 minute wait, OR we could sit at their cocktail tables in the bar area. Right away I notice 3 tables empty behind the hostess area, and several open booths in the dining area. I ask if we can sit in the half-booths behind them, and the hostesses said, \\"oh yeah, those are part of the cocktail area,\\" which wasn't what we were told when we went in, but that's okay. We sit down and get a chance to look through the menu.\\n\\nThe selections are sort of \\"upper-class Chili's\\", which is okay. The burgers looked delicious as did the tacos and grilled selections. We started with the bacon-wrapped quail, which was quite good. My only complaint would be leaving in the bones, which seems like an awful lot of work for a tiny amount of meat.\\n\\nI opted for the pumpkin seed pesto marinaded grilled chicken breast (say that three times fast!), and my husband had the chicken fried NY Strip. Both were very good and flavorful, and the portions were on the spot. Definitely a good food experience.\\n\\nI do wish they would expand on their \\"all-local\\" food experience, as I like to know where my food is coming from (are we talking local as in down the street, or just in the states?).

The men think they're hot stuff and the ladies think they're supermodels. They also pass judgment on people, which is so obvious. One time I saw the guy bartenders stare down a girl who was there with her boyfriend (I'm guessing) and remark that she wasn't pretty enough for him. It's like, mind your own business. Out of all the bars I've been to in boston, they are definitely the biggest douches ever. \\n\\n2. The service isn't that great. I can't even tell you how many times they have messed up my drink or food orders. \\n\\n3. The drinks are SO expensive.

The menu was our next shocker because the average dish is probably $11.99 with many dishes north of that. The table service was excellent, friendly, fast and the ambience was fair -  not too noisy although there was only one other patron in the restaurant.  The food? Well, between the four of us we only had three dishes because two of us got the same thing and I guess none of us could complain or rave too much, I don't want to say average but just nothing that exciting.

We found this restaurant the night before  - knowing there aren't as many options in North Vancouver for food. \\n\\nHaving read the other reviews, we were prepared for the restaurant space to be \\"dated\\" and also someone had mentioned ants in the dining area. However, when we walked in, we saw that the dining area was huge (or we may be biased and used to small NYC dining spaces) and looked clean and comfortable. The space was a huge sun room, which was really nice because it allowed a lot of natural light to come in and you could feel like you were sitting outside when you're obviously not. \\n\\nKeep in mind, this was 3 pm and we were the only guests at the restaurant. The waitress/owner/manager (probably all three) was very attentive and didn't give us a dirty look when we told her we'd just like to split one dish. We ordered the Seafood Chow Mein, which turned out to be pretty good for what seemed to be prepared in about 5 minutes. Our peaceful and happy experience soon changed, in the middle of our lunch, when we saw a huge ant (yes, much larger than normal) crawl onto our table. Luckily, we were prepared from the yelp review, so we pretty much just stared at the ant and thought about how awesome Yelp is. \\n\\nThe food is pretty good, but we don't think there's much competition around that area. \\n\\nPros: Large space, sun room, decent food.\\nCons: huge ants (well, we only saw one, but there must be others)"},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very disappointed in the food today.

The cook, he's seemless and he cooks up perfect eggs.

The bartenders were awesome (to the point that I asked for their first names so I can give props to them on Yelp - Rob and Maria). They were very friendly and attentive. I'm used to bars downtown, where bartenders just wreak of attitude problems and it's impossible to get their attention. This totally was not the case with Rob and Maria. In fact, despite the fact that I hate going to chain restaurants, I would totally go back to Unos just because the bar service was so remarkable. \\n\\nThe only reason I had to drop it down a star is due to my take-out order. I ordered my absolute favorite, the Chopped Honey Crisp Chicken salad (I've been eating it for years, and I cannot get enough of it). It comes with chicken tenders, mixed greens, vermicelli, bacon, bell peppers, tomatoes, Cheddar and honey mustard. I recently moved away from any local Unos, so I was totally psyched/ecstatic for it. However, when I got home, THERE WAS NO VERMICELLI - which is part of why this is SUCH a great salad. It actually soured my mood! Also, in the past, the salad came with a breadstick, and I didn't get one this time. Don't hold me to that though, it's been a good year since I've been at an Unos so their \\"breadstick\\" policy could have changed? \\n\\nEither way: if you're debating to grab a drink at a bar before a game or just because you're around Kenmore - I really suggest Unos.

Amazing service is everything!)"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great beer of course. Great great menu.

It's a shame since some things there have actually improved under the new management. Here's hoping they're able to get things right soon. \\n\\nUnder Sunny's management I would have given it a solid 4 stars every single time. The wait staff was great, our orders were consistently correct, and the food quality was always consistently very good. We only had a problem with our order maybe once in over five years -- I'd say that's pretty stellar. Granted, Sunny could seem cranky to folks sometimes, and she wasn't terribly warm as a hostess, but as a regular she was always very pleasant to me. Besides, I don't really give a crap about the hostess -- as long as the wait staff is good and the food is good, that's all I really care about. But that's just me. \\n\\nPost Sunny, the wait staff is still great and the new owners are incredibly friendly. They've actually really gone out of their way to make some improvements (i.e. replacing the old thimble-sized coffee cups with normal mugs, moving the paper towel dispenser in the bathroom to typical human height, trying new desserts, etc.) while still keeping what works. The one thing they can't get right yet is the food, and that's pretty crucial.\\n\\nInitially the original cook Willie stayed on to help train some of the new cooks. The days Willie worked the food still came out great, but the new cooks never got up to the same skill level, and now that Willie is gone, it seems they have no idea what they're doing. We were keeping the same visit frequency as we were before (mom and I go out for breakfast every Saturday), but with the new cooks, we were literally sending things back almost every week. Just a few examples: \\n\\n~ Scrambled eggs came out wet and oozy. I sent them back, and they put THE SAME EGGS back on the griddle until they were brown, dry nuggets. I sent them back again. The third try was not the charm -- they were marginally less oozy, but by this time I said eff it and just didn't eat them. Now here it is, a full year later, and they still can't get eggs right.\\n~ Ordered a hamburger patty medium rare. It came out totally raw in the middle. Sent it back and it came out marginally less raw but still wrong. \\n~ Pancakes came out with a raw liquid batter center. What's shocking is that they were clearly vampire pale when they were sent out, so either the cook didn't know better or didn't care. \\n~ Ordered a hamburger patty on a different day with fruit and a croissant. They put the croissant on the SAME PLATE that had the pool of liquid from the hamburger and the pool of liquid from the fruit. The croissant became a nauseating sponge. \\n~ Mom ordered bacon that even Viagra couldn't help.

I also really appreciate the dated Texas decor and faint red lighting, it makes me feel cozy and happy that there's still a little classic character in town.\\n\\nNote: I did make the mistake of stopping in with my entire family before a UT football game once, expecting it to be crowded, and it definitely was. The wait for the table wasn't so bad, but food was backed up pretty significantly. Still, that was to be expected and we planned accordingly - it's just something to consider if you accidentally stumble in on one of those days. Still doesn't detract from my five stars."},{"name":"Aviator Pizza & Drafthouse","address":"6501 S Congress Ave, Ste 1-105","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is great.

I used to go to a coffee shop with patio across the street at the outlet of Pearl alley onto Gay Street (where the J. Gumbo's is) and wondered why on earth they would open sooo close to another cafe. I gave it a shot and liked it but it remained a good mix for a while. Eventually the other place whose name I no longer recall went out of business and Brioso became my main source of caffeine-addled nerves.\\n\\nThe easy distinction that owner Jeff Davis nailed was the quality of the coffee. But not only that, it was in his own skills roasting and in hiring great staff. Having on-site roasted coffee is definitely a distinction I had not previously considered before, in spite of a few years roasting Sweet Marias from a popcorn popper. Further, were there not that delicious coffee-roasting smoke billowing out every so many hours, or the courteous , helpful, pleasant, knowledgeable, and interesting staff, I don't know if it could quite possibly have grown up to have the kind of reach it has (i.e. walk in to Tip Top or Dirty Frank's, you're drinking Brioso coffee).\\n\\nThat said, while Bob's bar may bill itself as the Cultural Hub of the Midwest, I think Jeff and his staff have had an amazing connection to not just downtown Columbus but the whole local community. I'm not talking hanging local artists' work (which they do), but I'm talking about every single bike event, barista/roaster events, letting me publicize some events I was doing, supported me in two cooking competitions, Mayor events, on top with pour-over coffee, if you want good coffee you got to Brioso so if you want to impress a client... local agriculture, local agribusiness (composting, vermiculture)... seriously the list goes on and on.\\n\\nFOOD, DRINK; I've already mentioned that the coffee is good. That is to say, I've spent the better part of six years on most business days getting off the COTA and drinking Brioso coffee. For a year after a divorce and settling in at work and a newly re-scoped life I sat at that bar and had a Cubano and treated myself to an hour of enjoying my coffee. Then I went vegan and they happily accomodated me with a Soybano, which is the Cubano with soy milk and is just as good and in spite of the difficulty doing foam art with soy they nailed it on most attempts.\\n\\nIn terms of a professional shop, every roast is a gem, the staff knows what they're talking about AND they're not only moderately pleasant but happy and enjoyable. \\n\\nThe curry chicken salad is great and has been on the menu since open I think. I desperately miss the tomato-basil soup (has cream). I normally kick it with the potato kale soup (which would be a bit better if they pureed half of the potatoes, or a can of butter beans and included it; as is it's not bad just comes off watery), a big bowl of fruit salad, or any of the vegan options.\\n\\nI recall they had a liquor license for a summer back in 2008 or so. Even then, Jeff's good taste meant they stocked Unibroue mostly; unfortunately the beer is gone but no big loss."},{"name":"Vinny Testa's Bar Ristorante","address":"233 Elm St","city":"Dedham","stars":"3","text":"Oh my, where to begin. \\n\\nI feel bad for our waiter.

We also decided to get a few beer samplers. They have local favorites, weird and wacky, and employee's choice. Just to name a few. Great selection of brews and I was able to try a bunch of different kinds.\\n\\nI decided I just wanted a plain ol brat with stone mustard. That is exactly what they provided. The bun was this soft bread that soaked up the juices of the brat and made the whole thing come together. Nice snap of the sausage with great flavor too. I imagine this place can get pretty popping because there was a little stage area where I think they would have live music, some cornhole to pass the time, a grill pit so the grill master can join the party too. \\n\\nAll in all, as an out of towner I'm glad I made a stop at Banger's."},{"name":"Zaxby's Chicken Fingers & Buffalo Wings","address":"4067 Millenia Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Ok...so I went to my first Zaxby's in Alabama quite a few years ago and I remembered I loved it.

What arrived was not the regular pint, but a schooner, which is a giant goblet that holds basically two pints. When we questioned it, the waiter explained that he had brought them on purpose because it was the Thirsty Thursday special. We asked if that meant a schooner for the price of a pint, and the waiter said yeah. No problem...I didn't really want 32 ounces of beer since I had to work early the next day, but if it was free, what the hell, if I don't finish it, no problem. But when the check arrived, the beers were $7.50 each. We asked the waiter about the charge and he said that was the special price. I asked, \\"so a pint of this beer costs $7.50?\\" The waiter said yeah. I knew this was not the case, and when I grabbed the beer menu to point out that the price was actually something like $4.50 for a pint, he quickly tried to cover his ass and say, oh, well, that's not the actual price of a pint, but more or less...after the discount it is just about the same thing. I responded that $1 off (which is what the actual special turned out to be once I looked it up) was not even close to the price of the pint. He got irate and started badgering me, saying that he has never had anybody complain, and that he always brings a schooner automatically on Thursday without asking, and that if we didn't want to pay, just take it out of his tip. He continued by saying that he brings schooners even to \\"girls\\", and that not even any girls had ever complained. When I pointed out that I thought that the conversation was taking a very weird turn (I mean, really...why would you tell a gay couple that not even women complain about being automatically upsold?), he again just said that he didn't care, nobody else has ever complained, but if we \\"have a problem\\" with it and don't want to pay for the schooners, to just take it out of his tip. \\n\\nWhatever, dude. Way to turn a simple misunderstanding into an epically bad customer service experience. Except that I guess it wasn't ever a misunderstanding.

We happened upon Bulpan Grill by chance. Neither one of us had had Korean BBQ before, although I was familiar with the concept. With that in mind, I can't compare Bulpan to other similar establishments, but I can tell you that my first experience here was amazing.\\n\\nI was a little worried going in on a Tuesday evening at what I expected to be the dinner rush and seeing the place completely dead. We were literally the only patrons except for another diner who was being seated as we were leaving. Fortunately, the emptiness was not an indicator of the quality (and I truly hope business is good despite the appearance, because I did love this place). Our waiter was very friendly, accommodating, and incredibly patient with our naivety regarding the feast that we were about to enjoy; he provided some helpful suggestions when it came time to order our main meats. There were plenty of sushi and Chinese dishes to choose from, but my coworker and I opted for the \\"authentic\\" Korean BBQ experience, which involves ordering and cooking your own meat at the table. We decided to split the \\"Set A\\" BBQ option, which consists of 2-4 meat choices, as well as a bevy of sides including dumplings, rice, veggies, lettuce wraps, kimchi (and other traditional sides I don't know the names of), and choice of soup. Again, I have nothing to compare this to, but $70 for all of this for 2 people seems reasonable in my book.\\n\\nWanting to try something I'd never had before, I chose the soft tofu soup. No lie, probably the best soup I've ever tasted. It was just the right amount of spicy and incredibly flavorful. For the meat options, we chose pork belly (the only unmarinated option we went for), galbi, beef bulgogi, and chicken bulgogi. Everything was delicious. The marinated meats were especially tasty and the galbi & beef bulgogi were incredibly tender as well. The sides were all excellent too, especially the dumplings, the kimchi, and the marinated cucumbers. By the end, we were stuffed and happy.\\n\\nCooking your own meat in a restaurant may seem intimidating at first, but it's really an awesome experience. We managed not to burn anything or embarrass ourselves.

It's actually a whole Vietnamese style sub cut into pieces. The pickled veggies are spot on, as are the French rolls it's all served on. Sadly, the beef was not Korean style at all and was too thickly sliced. If they revamped this one to where the meat was actually bulgoki, this would be the most amazing fusion banh mi ever!

The sandwich was so good, the bread was perfectly grilled, there was the perfect combination of meat and sauerkraut with dressing and cheese. The tater tots were good, but really, who could screw up tater tots? Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food too, they order the shrimp and grits, the bacon and eggs and the flat iron. I feel like the small plates are worth the cost, but some of the entrees seemed kind of pricey for what they were. Another reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that their bar ran out of brandy that I had wanted for a brandy old fashioned. They offered me cognac, which yes I know is a type of brandy, but of course the cognac selection was more expensive. I mean come on, you have a bar, how do you run out of brandy? Another thing was they did not have enough menus for everyone at our table to have their own. I don't mean to sound nit picky, and yes, we were able to share and it worked out fine, but when we had asked if we could have more we were given a strange look and told, \\"Don't you have some already?\\".

The reviews here were pretty good, the decor and ambiance looked pretty authentic, and the smell was good.\\n\\nWe got seated very quickly, and were given a jug of water and menus. I thought that was pretty smart because they don't have to keep constant tabs on our water levels. Later on, they gave us kimchi, daikon, and a few other side dishes. \\n\\nThere were classic Korean foods, Kalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Tofu Soup, etc. But what we came here for was the handmade noodles. \\n\\nSo we ordered three things: Pork noodles (not actually called this on the menu), mapo tofu, and an octopus dish (grilled octopus with salad).\\n\\nThe pork noodles were a bit disappointing. I've had some pretty authentic chinese hand-pulled noodles, and they were not as hard as this. We got this really really spicy (the highest spice level), but it wasn't THAT hot. Maybe we have a large heat tolerance, but it everything but the flavor were below expectations. The noodles were a bit too chewy and hard and the spice level was not as hot as we wanted. But the flavor was good. The dish was enjoyable.\\n\\nThe mapo tofu was great. The tofu was silky, the pork was great, and the sauce was very flavorful. The dish brought me some nostalgia to the classic mapo tofu dish that my mom would make. While we were eating this, the table next to ours asked us what dish this was, and ordered one for themselves. \\n\\nThe octopus dish was also good. I cannot recall the name of the dish, but it was essentially grilled octopus with some lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and some other vegetables (kind of like a salad) all mixed with some red pepper sauce that was not very hot. It was a great dish. The octopus was cooked perfectly and the vegetables complemented the octopus well in terms of texture, all providing for a pretty refreshing dish. Something I would have liked more was more octopus in the dish. This was an octopus dish, so I expect WAY more octopus than other things. But the proportion of octopus to vegetables was just a bit over 1:1.\\n\\nEither way, this restaurant had some pretty good flavor. We had pretty high expectations coming in, probably because I come from Southern California, where there are all types of asian foods in every corner of the street. The dishes are reasonably priced.

Sadly, this is not the restaurant that it used to be.\\n\\nThis used to be a German restaurant that put bold dishes on the menu. My favorite was a smoked pork chop served with pineapple-habanero sauerkraut. It had so much flavor, and worked so well. My wife routinely ordered a marinated flank steak that was served charred on the outside and rare inside. Again, it was full of flavor and every single bite was delicious. And the dessert menu was always equally delightful.\\n\\nAll of those favorite dishes are long gone. Now, the signature fondue is grainy instead of creamy, and instead of enjoying the flavor of white wine, it just tastes overwhelmingly of salt. The cabbage rolls, once delightfully both sweet and sour, are now just bland. \\n\\nThe restaurant used to have a massive rotisserie right in the entryway, with rows of seasoned chickens and pork roasts turning slowly, fat spitting and popping. The smell was wonderful, and it was the first thing you saw when you walked in the door.

I love dark chocolate and this really hit the spot.\\n\\nTotal bill for two exceeded what I was willing to pay and I am not cheap by any stretch of the imagination - I guess you pay for the ambiance and unique location of the restaurant.

I've had experiences in the past that were fair, some that were good, and some that were bad but today took the desire to come back away. The food is usually pretty good, but like others have said the service is lacking. Today, I called at about 1:30 to place a to-go order for my office, as we have to order in daily. When the phone was answered the (presumably) bartender asked me to hold, so I did- mind you he didn't put the phone on a hold, he just sat the receiver down. I waited for ten minutes without anyone picking it back up, so finally I hung up thinking I could just call back- I was very wrong. Because he just left the phone off the hook, I couldn't get back through. I spent another ten minutes trying to get back through the line. Finally I gave up and just drove to the restaurant (about eight miles away) because everyone had already given me their orders and I couldn't change restaurants at that point. When I arrived at the restaurant, I started to place my order and the bartender made me feel like I was such a massive inconvenience to him because I had a large office order (granted, it was all paid together, so it should've been pretty easy as far as large orders go). When I ordered a salad for someone I had to call to ask her what kind of dressing she wanted. While I was repeating what she said back to her, I was interrupted by the bartender saying \\"all dressing comes on the side for to-go\\", and while the words are not rude, the intonation and way in which it was done were. Once I placed my order, I sat down at one of the empty tables to wait, apparently the food was ready and packaged but I wasn't told. I just happened to look up to see two bags of food sitting on a table right by the door. I went to check on it, and it was ours- I guess it was too much of an inconvenience to let your customer know their food was good to go. This was some really poor customer service, and if you want repeat customers you have to treat them like they're not doing you some massive disservice by being there.

Consider my lesson learned! My burger was average, the bleucheese was very overwhelming and towards the end of the meal, i couldn't really taste any other flavor.\\n\\nMy fellow diners opted for lighter choices, a fish course as well as salads. The apple salad was disturbingly small, I was surprised my friend was full off of that. After sampling the salads, (an apple and a chicken salad) i found both dishes to be mediocre. THe chicken that topped the salad was tough and dry - barely edible. The standout dish of the day was definitely the cod. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. It was flavorful, but not overpowering, and the freshness of the fish shined through. \\n\\nOf the two desserts we ordered to share, the lemon tart was an amazing finish to the meal. Perfect balance of sweet and tart, and the crust of the tart provided the crunch texture for the tart. Yum! Creme brulee.....average like the rest of our meal. \\n\\nService was also average.

We had Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef With Black Bean Sauce and Diced Chicken with Cashews and nothing was left on the plates at the end. \\n\\nWhat I find so nice about this restaurant is the location. It is a drive up Capilano Drive towards Grouse Mountain and being away from the city and the strip mall stores you have a place where you can eat in a dining room overlooking a patio space where a bit of nature is something you can see.  \\n\\nThe other posters may have a case where the decor might be a bit dated but in the end I really was not looking for something ultra trendy or super stylish.

It's a robust mix of soups and sandwiches with a few salads as well. There should be a sandwich to please just about anyone. They're large, they're reasonably-priced, and they're tasty. Nothing life-changing, but good quality food. I had the Philly which, while not especially authentic, was yummy. I'm always a fan of substituting poblano peppers for bitter green bell peppers. It was served with rustic potato chips on the side and a nice little pickle and onion garnish.\\n\\nThe soups are actually listed on the menu so you're not at the mercy of the \\"soup of the day.\\" That's a big plus in my book.

I wish we would have tried one at 6 or 8 just so we know the difference.  I asked for Indian spicy level and the waitress said 7.  I have learned that the spiciest level at Indian Restaurants usually means they throw just hot sauce in it.  I like the taste to send me back to some the great Bengali dishes I had when I lived in Bangladesh.  This spice lingered on my lips for a little and almost made my nose run.  I think one more notch in the spicy category would have been perfect.\\n\\nThe place is a little expensive compared to the amount of food one gets.

Not worth eating but we were hungry. \\n\\nI ordered a soup for my toddler who loves soup, it was pretty terrible in flavor to where we didn't take the remainder home, and we are big food leftover savers. It also came out barely lukewarm, unsure if was on purpose but flavor suffered. Was broccoli cheese soup, usually one of the kid's favorite.

Their happy hour listings online seemed pretty decent.  As soon as we were sat the server came immediately over and asked what we would like to drink. I asked what their happy hour specials were and he immediately informed me that \\"there isn't any happy hour until after the football game starts). I was immediately flabbergasted but didn't feel like arguing so i just ordered a cherry coke (which he at first said he couldn't do).\\n\\nAfter he brought out the drinks my friend and i decided to order the boneless wings (hot) with ranch, sliders and the nachos. The first two things that were brought out were the wings and nachos (which were only brought out with cheese and beans on them when they shoulda had salsa, sour cream, guac).  The server informed us that the sliders were going to take another 6 minutes.  Finally over 10 minutes later the server showed up with the sliders (which were horrible and didn't taste fresh) and we were able to notify him that the nachos were missing some key toppings.  He immediately apologized and took them away from our table and they finally appeared another 10 minutes later (same serving we ate off of but with the toppings on them).\\n\\nWhile we were eating all of the staff (including the manager) was huddled near us at the bar (we were at a table) and you could hear them talking about things they were out of, people they slept with the night before, and how they didn't like their own beer selection so that was kind of a turn off.\\n\\nWhat i will say though was that their boneless wings were super good (even though they gave us the wrong sauce but we sucked it up).  They were super most and pretty large. I'd totally get them again, but thats probably all i would get.

Neither of us had been to this place before but we were looking for something new and different. The food was great, it was everything else that was the issue. I made a Valentine's reservation for 8pm. My boyfriend and I arrive a few minutes after 8, there are a LOT of open tables. They walk us over to a table right by the kitchen door. And immediately to our right is a table with a toddler. My boyfriend asked for a different table but they said they could only move us next to the DJ. (Despite MOST of the tables still being free at this point) I have some trouble hearing, especially in loud rooms, so I declined to move. The toddler screamed and made noise the entire time, which isn't the restaurant's fault but in addition to being next to the kitchen it was a lot of racket for what I wanted to be a romantic, intimate date.\\n\\nLike I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the food was good. There was a special prix fixe for Valentine's Day. I had the leek and mushroom soup. The leeks were a little brittle but it was good. My boyfriend had the dim sum plate. He said it was \\"weird\\" but that the pork bun was good. Then I had the prime rib and he had the lobster. The food runner made a faux pas in that they assumed my boyfriend had ordered the steak and gave him the steak knife. It was a LOT of food. Perhaps for their next event they should consider smaller portions and lowering the 50$ price. We took home food and we weren't even at the dessert course yet. We both ordered the cheesecake and it was delicious. There were also truffles and chocolate covered strawberries served. All of this would have been very romantic if I hadn't had the harsh light of the kitchen on one side and a crying child on the other. Major negative points on ambiance. \\n\\nThe first drink my boyfriend ordered had crushed ice. It seemed like lots of people have said something about the crushed ice from the way our server reacted when my boyfriend ordered a different second drink, citing the crushed ice as the reason for the change. He enjoyed both his drinks, he just thought the crushed ice watered down his drink. The first drink was the Fedora (the waiter mentioned it was the only one on the menu with crushed ice). I forget what he ordered second. I ordered a Nuevo Ano. It was excellent. Highly recommended. They do one large ice cube in that drink, which is nice. \\n\\nThe service was ok, our server was good. The restaurant did fill and it was Valentine's so understandable that at the end of our meal we had to ask for the check. I am a former server myself and I tipped very well. There was the one issue with mixing up our entrees. My main issue was with the hosts who wouldn't reseat us somewhere better. I also worked for a long time as a host, I know how stressful it is when you have a night full of reservations. They gave me an extra rose when I left as an apology.

I'm not sure which was which, but one was significantly better tasting than the other. \\n\\nYou can also become a member of their UFO club, which basically means you pay $18 for a \\"free\\" tshirt and a membership.

Banger's was one of the only places open mid-afternoon on a Monday and a beer and brat sounded delish. We sat down outside and weren't greeted for about 10 mins. I started to get pretty impatient so my friend went inside to talk to the bartender about beer selection. Our server acknowledged me and said he would be right out with waters, but later came back with drinks for a party sat AFTER us. I looked at him like \\"what the heck?\\" and he told me that since my friend was talking to the bartender, the bartender would just take care of us and we could place our order with him. I was very upset at this point.\\n\\nWe placed our order with the bartender and he made us a custom flight of local beers and ordered the special that had an apple, pear, cranberry compote/sauce on top. It was really good, but not wow-worthy. The beers were fun and I enjoyed trying the Liveoak Hefeweizen, Pinthouse Pizza Electric Jellyfish, and the Zilker coffee milk stout. \\n\\nThe server later came back and apologized and offered some great opinions on menu items and we placed the remainder of our order with him.

The location is located off Pharr Road, near Peachtree Rd, not far from the Roswell/141 split.  To our surprise, it was in a strip mall with an abundance of parking.  The restaurant is very small, and tables are very close to each other.  They had 4 tables outside as well.  I would not recommend bringing a large group here due to space, but perfect for 4 tops and 2 tops.  This location was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives with Guy Fieri, and the waitress mentioned he loved the home made hot sauce.\\n\\nThey were pretty busy for Sunday brunch, but we only waited 10 minutes.  We were seated and given their brunch menu.  I was searching for an omelette, which they had a couple options (salmon, ham & cheese stuck out to me).  I also was craving the breakfast burrito, which i will order for sure next time i come here.  I ended up going with one of their breakfast sandwiches, just to try something different, and sooooo glad i did. \\n\\nMy meal consisted of 2 cups of coffee and The Argentinean (grapes and orange slice included).  YUM!  It had a hefty portion of  light cheddar scrambled eggs & marinated skirt steak, along with red onions & delicious chimichurri, served on their HOME MADE brioche buns.  I scarfed it down!  The home made bun certainly made it that much better.  Thankfully, it overflowed onto my plate as i was eating it, so i got a side of their home made hot sauce to eat the rest with (forgot to order it until i was 75% done with my sandwich, mainly b/c it was that good and i just didn't have enough time to open my mouth and ask for it while satisfying the fat kid inside of me).\\n\\nThe hot sauce was really good and had a kick to it.  I detected some balsamic vinegar taste to it as well, which really enhanced the taste.  From what i know, my honey really liked her's too (probably because she had a hearty helping of chipotle mayo with every bite).  The only bad here:  the tight seating and the COLD bathrooms.  That bathroom must have been 45 degrees!  I'm assuming it's kept that way to hustle people out or for extra storage on their cold items???\\n\\nOverall, great place for some good-tasting food.

As for the teriyaki combo, it's like a bento box in that it comes with chicken teriyaki with rice, salad, some tempura, a california roll (or a roll of your choice that may cost extra), and miso soup. The rice that came with the chicken teriyaki was very mushy and clumped together which was slightly unappetizing. The california roll was mushy as well and again the rice was very sweet in the roll.

I've been waiting for you.  The food?  Pretty damn good, too.  The space?  Fantastic.  The kitchen?  Working on it...hopefully.  I loved my visits to Bangers, and I plan on being a regular.\\n\\nI've been twice since it has opened, once on opening night and once on Sunday afternoon.  Opening night was packed, and food/drinks took a good while, but my party and I had a wonderful time, and I've already shared the positivity with all my friends who I thought would enjoy Bangers.  This Sunday afternoon was decidedly not packed, with about 20 customers (as opposed to 200+ on opening night), and again we had a great time.\\n\\nThe Beers - (5 stars) This is a beer drinkers biergarten.  The beers are the main reason to visit.  If you're a 'beer bar' I should not be able to get all your beers at the supermarket or have tried them at every other beer bar I've been to (I'm wagging my finger at you Ginger Man).  Bangers has beers that I've never tried, are hard/nay impossible to find, and that I want to drink. To a beer novice, the menu may seem overwhelming, but for those of us in the know (who have some idea of what style beer they would like, etc.), it's well organized and extensive.  They have a fantastic selection of craft beers, and not simply a collection of all the local craft beers that you can get at a variety of 'beer bars' around Austin, but beers from around the country that are special.  That said, my girlfriend was served a witbier opening night in a goblet, and when I asked why it was served in the wrong glass, they said they were out of the correct one.  Unfortunately, the goblet is about 9 oz, and a pint or tall glass is about 16, so she got served about half a beer, and yes...we were still charged full price (it seemed to me that the bartender was surprised that I would actually know how to serve a beer properly).  The prices are higher than other local places (e.g. Cherrywood serves Devil's Backbone for $4, here it's $6-7), but I appreciate the need to charge more based on the setting.  All in all...Banger's beers = awesome.  \\n\\nThe Food - (4 stars)  Everything is tasty and satisfying!  I've had 3 different sausages, all of which were excellent, 2 types of buns, both of which were among the best I've ever had, and a few sauces and toppings, which again, were great.  Unlike what their menu says, the greens are better than the creamed corn IMO.  I'm giving 4 stars, because I hate to pay $7-8 for a sausage, especially, because as a big man, and I want to order two, but $16 for 2 sausages? Hmmm...  Still, everything I've eaten, I've thoroughly enjoyed.  Guess I'll just have to eat less and drink more.  I would recommend the greens, the Bockwurst, the Duck, Bacon, and Fig sausages, and the pretzel bun.  Be careful of the peppers, too.  They are delicious, and spicy!  (Managers, the pickled veggies were served in too much of the pickling liquid, which made it difficult to eat without loads of peppercorns, etc. stuck to them, please fix this...and I can't wait to try the pickles, which were sold out).\\n\\nThe Kitchen/Service - (3 stars) The waiters, waitresses, busboys, runners, and managers were all very helpful, happy, and focused.  But the kitchen and bar seem...slow.  Opening night?  Sure, I can understand waiting 90+ minutes for my sausages or 15 min for my beer.  On a slow Sunday afternoon?  IMO, my beer should be at my table within minutes of ordering, and food (sausages) within what, 30 min. to be fair?  The food still took too long to arrive, and the beers came too slowly.  This seemingly was not at all due to the wait staff, who were very attentive (same as the manager who helped us with a special request).  Again, it's just a speediness thing.  I want to drink!  and eat...\\n\\nAll in all - HIGHLY recommended for beer drinkers and sausage eaters.  So...since they serve beer and sausage?  Well done Bangers...well done.  I'll be back.  :)"},{"name":"Cha Shu Coffee and Bubble Tea","address":"62 Summer St","city":"Malden","stars":"4","text":"Their coffee and boba tea is delicious.

The valet called but they said it was not available that night. We had 12 people but I guess they didn't need the business. The next night the valet told us the same thing.

Went ahead and ordered a chicken wrap however when it arrived, the wrap was loosely packed and my first bite was into nothing but lettuce. I ordered a chicken wrap right? I opened up the wrap to see eight tiny marble sized pieces of chicken/breading. I'm 32y/o and I've never sent food back before IN MY LIFE and suffice it to say my first time is now at Kekes Breakfast Cafe UCF! Congrats to them for a badge earned in \\"customer's first time EVAR sending food back in his life\\" The manager came by and said their policy is every wrap gets 4oz of chicken (not mentioned on the menu). 4oz of chicken is appropriate for my 4yr old son. They're better off expanding the kids menu to include the chicken wraps. For a $9 dollar wrap I wasn't expecting a lettuce wrap garnished with chicken. I was asked to accept an upcharge to add another 2oz of chicken. With chicken at a retail price of $2 dollar a pound, I don't think a restaurant's profit margin would see a huge dent by putting some more chicken into a chicken wrap on the adult menu.

Lets start at the beginning.  You'll arrive at a double lot on hip Rainey Street with two craftsman houses that protect a sprawling beer garden with rows of picnic tables canopied by single string lights and hundred year old trees...yes you can even see those big bright Texas stars.   The main structure serves as the restaurant, a bustling 23-hour kitchen, a magic sausage lab, and is the vault for 103 beautiful taps of expertly chosen beer.  The second structure, (dating at least a century) serves as a live stage for daily music with a spectrum from big brass band to rock-a-billy\\n \\nIt is at this point, as a self-proclaimed foodie, (by virtue of a well travelled sophisticated palate) that a girl like me gets nervous....  Is the beauty only skin deep?  Is it possible for the food to hold up to how incredibly awesome this venue is? ....wait for it....ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY.  Chef Ted is a creative culinary genius. If he had super powers, I would be scared or at least what him on my team.  The menu is a testament to a man who truly understands meat and big flavors.  The shrimp and grits sausage plate was better than any 4-star restaurant in NOLA (yes, I did just say that).  The menu touts variations from venison and antelope, to beets and goat cheese.  If you think you are too cool for pass√© chili cheese fries...think again!   Oh, its Sunday Funday what should I do? The brunch is a no brainer. You can go big with a \\"Redneck Special\\", pulled pork smothered fries topped with an oozy egg...or you can nod to tradition, with a bagel and lox.  Either way, wash it down with man-mosa served up in a big ole' masculine beer mug, build your own michelada or drown your liver with a crisp white wine (like me).  You'll groove to live tunes on a sated belly and let the shampoo effect take hold.  No need to rush home to walk the mutt. Banger's is pooch friendly with a sizeable gated dog run. Say what?!\\n\\nIf you aren't convinced yet, the southern hospitality will make you blush.  Doting servers that are menu educated, balance professionalism with approachability.  The owner, Ben, must be one proud mofo because Banger's is an impressive institution with strong vision and long lasting brand vitality.\\n\\nI visited Austin for 4 days, I was at Banger's 4 times.

Ok yes, there was one fish entree. They were all really expensive, the 'giant' beef rib was $69 for example. So basically, you're not getting a few and trying them all. Other than that there are a few appetizer options, which is also deceiving because really, there are only 3 real options because there are some that are just toast with olive oil, or a tomato cricket salad, which I was not ready to order. They had some kind of prefixe deal for $35 per person, which was a chicken dish and dessert, + coffee/tea. We didn't try it, but maybe a decent deal.\\n\\nService was fine, the ambience was OK, smelled very smokey so be ready for that. The main issue I have with this place are the food options. To me, the restaurant seemed secondary to the butcher shop, and I get they are trying to be a butchershop/restaurant, but not everything needs to be ribs, steak, blood sausage, etc. It just didn't work for me.

Actually correction. You get free spring rolls if you check in on Yelp. So those came out first. The biggest spring rolls I've ever seen. But ah... Not impressed. But I dont care to much for spring rolls anyway.  The rest of the food though. Wow!!\\n\\nYang was our waitress and she was awesome. She did a great job explaining how this place works.

This just tastes...... hmm.... like how I'd imagine PF Changs should taste. Changs looks fancy on the out side but the Lo Mein is worse then a local take out Chinese place. Here it actually tastes like they put care into making the dishes. Even the beef skewers. I figured its probably like beef on a stick at your local Chinese restaurant. But thats not the case. They use better quality beef and its nice and juicy. Plus the Malaysian Satay sauce is great too.. Its like when you bite in you taste the meat, then 4 seconds later your tongue starts burning from the spices. Yum! I could go on about all the dishes as every single one we got was equally good.

The light fixture hanging over the table clearly hasnt been cleaned in years. Its really a shame because there is so much potential to this building. They have a salad bar that is used to house plants and a gorgeous fireplace that probably hasnt been used in years. A little paint and tons of elbow grease would do this place a world of good.\\n\\nThe menu is small and equates to the same kind of food you would find in any pub at happy hour. I order clam chowder and the Alaskan cod with shrimp. The menu said fresh cut fries but in fact they were any run of the mill store bought french fries. The butterfly shrimp again was store bought and pre-breaded and only two shrimp were served. The clam chowder was blah. It was thick but lacked seasoning and substance. I think I counted three small potatoes and no pieces of clam and it tasted as if the chef was allergic to salt.\\n\\nThe cod was ok for frozen cod. I would rather have had fresh but it was well battered, not greasy or overcooked but again, very bland in taste. It is the first time I have ever had to add salt to beer battered fish.\\n\\nWhat Tigard is missing is a really good steak and seafood joint that has that family owned vibe.

Reasonable enough, so we head to the bar.  Boy got a Negroni, I got the Vault, their St Germain/Gin concoction.  The Vault was perfectly refreshing, with the cucumber, mint, and lime accents.  \\n\\nWe were seated 15-20 minutes after putting our name in, and the host was super apologetic.  No, really dude.  Its ok.  Its Friday night in Harvard Square - to not expect a wait would have been madness.\\n\\nWe looked at the menu, and there were so many interesting looking items.  Chose lobster pups (how could you not?) and the black bean hummus, thinking we would order entrees.\\n\\nOH how wrong we were.\\n\\nFirst of all, the $7 lobster pups.  For all you complainers that there wasn't enough lobster?  THEY'RE SEVEN DOLLARS.  You get six of them.  And they definitely taste of lobster.  They're like fried, solidified lobster bisque.  Not really, but you have the same lobster taste without the chunks - and the added bonus of meyer lemon butter.  I was hesitant to dip something fried into butter.  How silly I was.  The lemon butter added a perfect sweetness.  Hit the spot.\\n\\nThe black bean hummus is huuuuuuuge.  Make no mistake.  This is not something you enter into alone.  A bread bowl of hummus, with grilled tofu squares, veggies, and pita.  The only lacking part of the meal were the pita triangles.  First Printer, why fry perfectly good pita bread?  It was greasy and weird.  The hummus was filling, with an awesome cilantro/allspice/cinnamon flavor that I can only hope to replicate.\\n\\nThe restroom was perfectly clean, had hand lotion (always a plus) and an entertaining sign by the door that said \\"Lock the door... or make new friends.\\"  Cute!\\n\\nThe only other negative thing I'd comment on is the amount of time it took our server to bring the bill.

We wanted to wait for rice to eat our spicy pork bulgolgi. No rice and more than 5 minutes have passed.  The sweetheart is already digging into the bulgogi.

I eat rice with everything. It surprised me how violently angry I got when this guy came back with ONE rice bowl and sets it in front of the sweetheart. I barely kept the \\"oh hell no\\" from coming out. I give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe they're cooking more rice, maybe they ran out of bowls.  I had to mentally count to ten and when the sweetheart confirmed that it didn't look like the guy was coming back with another rice bowl, I went to get my rice bowl.

I will be delighted to explain further in my review.\\n\\nH. Harper Station has opened in the space formerly occupied by 'The Depot' and is conveniently located directly across from our condo.  Having a restaurant/bar back in this space does great things for the neighborhood and I'm glad to see tonight that the place was busy.  \\n\\nLet's start with the drinks -- this is where the 1/2 star comes in.  The drinks were both delicious and well-made.  However, a spot that is going to bill themselves a 'modern watering hole' needs to pick up the pace EVER so slightly.  I will cut them some slack, this is only the 5th night they have been open to the public and the drinks are complicated, which in and of itself is a reason to return so I can try ALL of them.  Here's a run down of what we had...\\n\\nVodka-based:  Ruby Slipper -- this had grapefruit, rosemary, and soda water.  Light, refreshing, and could be a 'go to' cocktail.\\n\\nTequila-based:  Papa Doble -- lime, more grapefruit, and maraschino bitters.  This one was a bit more complex, definitely on the sours/bitter side, but good nonetheless.\\n\\nBourbon-based: Black & Blue -- this was by far my favorite.  Probably because it seems like bourbon is a hard liquor to make a well-crafted cocktail.  This had blueberry, blackberry, vanilla, soda, and more bitters.  So good!\\n\\nGin-based:  Aviation -- lemon, maraschino bitters, and a violet liqueur.  Also tasty, light, and could get you in trouble quickly I feel.\\n\\nSo apparently, we're alcoholics -- oh well!  On to the food!\\n\\nAppetizer:  Relish Tray, serves one, can be increased in scale to serve more. We did it for two -- imagine you're at your Southern grandma's house and she's serving you her finest deviled eggs, pickled vegetables, and pimiento cheese.  Insanely good and a swift kick in the face to awaken your palate.  \\n\\nEntrees -- we split a couple and had the 'Night Trains' which were mini-pulled pork subs, topped with coleslaw, golden raisins and a touch of dill.  Considering these guys are of the 'Rollings Bones' family I knew this would be great.  You get two with an order including a side of Cajun Dill Zapp's potato chips.  \\n\\nWe also split the 'Beltline Burger' and I think of the two ordered tonight, this was my favorite.  A burger with beef that tastes like beef should, topped with a touch of pulled pork, melted cheddar cheese, grilled onions, arugula, and pickled vegetables.  Last but not least the burger was served with insanely delicious tater tots.  That's right, I said it, delicious tater tots.  There is some mystery spice on these that made them taste amazing, so I can see more tater tots in my future.  \\n\\nSo, by length of this review I think you can tell that I am enthused to see a top-notch restaurant back in the space formerly known as 'The Depot'.  This is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to many a pre-prohibition cocktail here.\\n\\nKudos to the team leading up 'H. Harper Station'."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for hanging out and drinking beer.

For a small sign up fee you get awesome things...gift cards and prizes for reaching your goal of drinking so many beers (not all at once - they have a limit for how many you can log per day). And they send you emails to complete quizzes. If you get a fair amount correct you get five bucks off your beer for the coupon dates. And after 200 beers you get a saucer on their wall and a party.

The rest went into the air conditioned dark bliss of the bar. But, the broken door between patio and bar was a challenge, so it was propped open.  Sorry, folks, who wanted AC. Please enjoy the heat and smoke we're sending in.\\n2) The work function that was there, and had booked in advance, I think, appeared to have no ability to reserve outside tables.  So, the poor woman who scheduled the event had to dart around saving tables outside. Not much fun for her, but perhaps there had not been a reservation?\\n3) The cruncher...a huge dog \\"leaving\\" was just outside the door between door and patio. Not pleasant at any point, but in a crowd standing in scorching heat, terrible. Several times it was noticed by servers but not cleaned up.

The first time I went, the server took our order, but didn't write it down.  I ordered a large and my girlfriend ordered a medium.  When we got our food, we got the wrong bowl sizes, I got a medium and she got a small.  Instead of the server offering to take it back in, and get us the correct size, he offered to cure his mistake with giving me and my gf and side of extra noodles.  Keep in mind that when you order not only did we get less, noodles but also less meat and broth.  Also, the portions were somewhat less than what you would get at other pho restaurants.  We were starving and we got less noodles and less meat than what we had wanted.  The taste of the pho was mediocre.  It didn't make me say \\"Dam!  Finally some good pho in Boulder!\\"  I thought, \\"eh, it's ok and I've had A LOT better pho\\".  I was a little upset, but shrugged it off and agreed that maybe I'd give it another try.\\n\\nThe second time I went, I ordered the combination rice plate or (com dac biet).

We decided to try Blue Ribbon as we could not locate any food trucks.  I enjoyed it!  The staff was friendly, we sat in a nearly empty, air-conditioned room, and I thought the food was not bad.  The cups are huge.  Everything really is bigger here.  The slaw tasted fresh and there is a station to add sauce and condiments such as onions.  Mixing onions and sour cream with the barbecue and sauce is perfect.

I have to say that Canoe most certainly lives up to it's stellar reputation.  My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday evening, and the place was pleasantly busy. Canoe's atmosphere is full of life.  Our server was clearly very well-trained in fine dining, and was very knowledgable about the restaurant and attentive to our needs.  One thing that we loved learning about while we were there was that Canoe has their own \\"kind\\" chicken coup, grows much of their own produce onsite, and that they have close relationships with all of their food distributor's, so if you have a question (I.E.:  \\"Where did this cut of meat come from?\\") they have a legitimate answer to give you.  I praise hem for not going the cheap route and buying from factory farms.\\n\\nWe tried a Smoked Salmon appetizer that was to-die-for, the rabbit which was possibly the greatest thing that I have ever eaten, the duck, and two different desserts.  Everything was cooked to perfection, was beautifully garnished, and was memorably flavorful.

I would suggest the country-fried steak, bbq cauliflower, and mac and cheese (one of the best).  If you've ever been let down by a vegan macaroni and cheese, you must go to Soul Veg.  My brother who is an amazing vegetarian cook craves for the vegan mac and cheese here.  He's willing to drive 6+ hours for it until he can figure out how they make it.\\n\\nOverall, I really love Soul Veg. The food is great, but the prices are a little high for its portions.  However, it's definitely a great meal.  I tasted the ice cream and thought it was ok.  I have tried better vegan ice cream from super markets like Kroger and Whole Foods.

There are a lot of good things about this place, though a few drawbacks that make it not something I'd recommend really to friends.  \\n\\nFirst the good:  \\n\\n1)  Reservation was easy to set, we arrived early and they were able to seat us early (not something that usually happens, we just happened to be in the area ahead of schedule).  We appreciated that quite a bit. \\n\\n2)  Easy parking.   Like many places in Atlanta, Canoe has forced valet parking.  I dislike valet parking with a passion, but it does make things easier, and in a place as parking challenged as Atlanta, its just a necessity.\\n\\n3)  Fast service.  The service was quick, though very much what I would call \\"cold\\" (more on this later).\\n\\n4)  Well prepared/presented food.  Our orders \\"looked\\" as we would expect from this level of restaurant, tasted OK (some parts were GREAT, others were just OK ... more on this in a bit).\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1)  Very small portion sizes on some meals, huge on others, no indication which meal falls which way.  We ordered the Rabbit and the Steak.  The portion size for the Rabbit was extremely small (about a half ounce of meat with maybe 1/2 cup pasta/greens).  While it was enough for a me, (I don't take a lot to fill up usually), I suspect a lot of folks who are used to receiving over sized portions of food these days would be very disappointed.  My wife's steak, on the other hand, was huge, more than someone could eat in one sitting.  It was a contrast that we couldn't help but share a bit of a laugh over.\\n\\n2)  \\"Cold\\" service.  The server (while quick and efficient) left us feeling like the sort of unwelcome guests that come over and visit unexpected.  We received everything we asked for (which wasn't much) but the staff rarely made eye contact and would frequently just let sentences just trail off (volume wise) like they were either disinterested, or not confident in what they were saying.  Our main waitress actually interrupted herself once when we were asking about iced tea for my wife, made a quick comment to the order of \\"you'll see\\" and then just walked off.  When she returned she gave a quick explanation of adding the syrup to the tea to make it sweet (this was good, since sweet tea is almost always too sweet, my wife liked being able to control the sweetness herself).\\n\\n3)  The place was dark, very dark.  While I love low lighting, we couldn't help but speculate exactly what the lack of lighting was likely covering up.  The place is in a somewhat dingy strip mall and I have no doubt that the low lighting is used to cover  up a less than stellar interior.\\n\\n4)  Cost to taste \\"value\\".  I almost hate to post this part, as food tastes are subjective  to the point of sometimes being not useful, but here is our perception of the meal:\\n\\n\\nThe food was \\"OK\\", we've had much better food at this price point, with more warm/personal service.  We both expected a lot more out of the visit based on the Yelp reviews.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nSteak:  Huge portion of steak.  It was well cooked and pretty darn close to the level my wife ordered.  The flavor of the steak was good, however, the \\"side\\" dishes were the star.  I'm pretty sure she'd of exchange about half of the meat portion for a larger portion of the side items and been much happier with her choice.\\n\\nRabbit:  Tiny portion of rabbit (this is mostly normal for this type of dish though).  It was well cooked, though had almost no flavor.  About 1/5th of the meat was inedible.  You would expect this some places, I did not from Canoe though.  The \\"side\\" items, mostly ravioli and greens, with this dish were fantastic.  I found myself wishing I could just send the rabbit back and order a double portion of the ravioli and greens (both of which were also very small portions).  \\n\\n\\nRecommend to a friend:  No"},{"name":"Sal's Ristorante & Pizzeria","address":"205 L St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place.

We had called ahead, so they knew we were coming and had a special area set up for us. Wait staff was attentive, already had water fixed for those that wanted it. Interior of the restaurant was pretty blah, along the lines of a Shoneys or Dennys. Food was pretty similar to those places as well. I had a party melt with tots. It was ok - the patty melt could have used some kind of sauce and the toys could have used some salt. My friend ordered pot pie, but they were out - it would have been nice if they would have told her before they were bringing out everyone else's food, and she had to wait for her 2nd choice meal to come out. Hands down, the best thing about this place is the dessert. For $3.99 you could add and drink and a piece of pie to your entree. You really can't beat a deal like that. I had the peanut butter silk pie, and it was amazing. My friend had the cherry pie - she said it would have been better if they'd warmed it up. \\nBottom line - if you're in this area in Orlando, there are a lot of other options that will be nicer and have better food.

I received a text from the salon asking me how my experience was, so I was honest. I told them I wasn't happy. I got s call from the British lady that did my hair apologizing and stating that she will correct it for me at no cost. I honestly thought that was very nice and ethical on their part. \\n\\nI made an appointment and she did fix my color, however she did not look happy doing it.

Ok cool, Lucy blow dried my hair AND BOY IS THAT WOMANS HAND AWESOME \\n\\n\\nOk, let's fast forward to why I didn't go back. Plain and simple. I didn't go back because my service took too long due to gossip in the salon amongst co-workers on how they are being taken for a ride by the owner with their pay! Honestly, that's non of my business and I don't want to be part of that salon drama. As a customer I don't need to know the dirty laundry of the salon.

Ground chicken on top adds a slight bit of chew and meatiness, but this dish is not a punch-y dish, it's subtle, zephyr-like.\\nWe had the fresh poh piah as well, which was again very refreshing with a satisfying crunch.

The food is okay, but there is no angelic Hallelujah chorus erupting after tasting two seafood dishes and with the price point, it should have been.\\n\\nAlthough I was unimpressed with the menu, I was intrigued to dine here based on the fact that the chef is a James Beard nominee. By my account and taste, he excels in simplicity, and clearly that is a laudable cooking style, but the food fell boring and flat on my and my tablemate's palate.\\n\\nI wanted to order the snapper entree which is paired with kale, but the waitress said they ran out of snapper and kale so they were replaced with trigger fish and collards. So yeah, totally the same entree.\\n\\n*blink*\\n\\nAnyway, the trigger fish was fresh and moist but it had no special flavor other than the taste of the fish itself. That's what I mean by the chef excelling in simplicity - the fish was prepared well but it was plain.\\n\\nThe other seafood item was the NC trout. Incredibly fresh but it's size seemed like it was a bit small. My 70yr old mother finished it and was still hungry. I tasted that as well and it was plain. Like the triggerfish above, it was prepared well - one of the moistest filets I've tasted but that was all I tasted - fish. Nothing exciting. It was accompanied by bacon-mayo spread that came on the side, which my mom tried but I did not.  She's a bacon lover and she said it didn't do anything for the meal. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the pork loin which I did not taste and he enjoyed his meal but he said it was not anything he couldn't find at another restaurant in Atlanta. (Sorry for the double negative there.)\\n\\nI usually don't take a star off for service bc I don't think one bad service experience should ruin a restaurant, however the exception is when the price point elevates the dining experience such that one is expected to have exceptional service. She was absent, aloof and we were made to feel like she generally did not care about this table. \\n\\nDo you know what's more disappointing than a disappointing dessert? NOTHING.  So here we are at CAKES & Ale...(CAKES, People, it's in the friggin name) and there was one friggin cake on the dessert menu. I do believe the word CAKES in the name is plural. \\n\\nNevertheless, we ordered the chocolate cake, creme br√ªl√©e and the Apple pie which was more like an apple-pie-half-dollar. The br√ªl√©e had the soft essence of blood orange and was br√ªl√©ed correctly. The apple pie was literally the size of a half dollar and the crust was a dried biscuit- like the kind you'd throw at a window when you realized you over-kneaded it and forgot to add butter/buttermilk. The chocolate cake was the best dessert bc it was not overly rich but had a lovely chocolate flavor.\\n\\nThe ambiance is trendy and loud.  I wouldn't take a first date here.  I don't mind noise though; it's a good atmosphere with a group. I thought people who be more dressy but it was trendy casual. \\n\\nIf you're traveling through, I wouldn't recommend making a stop.

Every time I've tried to go, though, it's been slammed, so I was excited to be in Orlando making one of my usual visits and try the food so many in Jax are raving about. Note: this is tapas-style dining, so your food will come out as it is ready and not in the sequence by which you order.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is simple and modern, with clean lines and an open-feeling space. I thought the large photographs of actual \\"hawkers\\" were very interesting and lent to the authenticity. Loved the newspaper tabletops.\\n\\nCame in on a Wednesday afternoon after the lunch rush, late lunch early dinner. The service was outstanding. We told our waitress it was our first time dining with Hawkers, and without hesitation she began a brief but very comprehensive run-through of the menu. We put in for a large hot sake and waters while we debated over our dish selections. There is definitely a lot to choose from. The orange slices in the waters were a nice touch, and we never wanted for refills even if another staff member noticed. When it was time to pack up the leftovers, she brought us exactly the sizes and shapes of containers we needed. Awesome. \\n\\nWe ordered roti canai with an additional roti, roast duck, prawn mee, five spice calamari, and a side of white rice. The duck came out first, almost lightning fast. The meat was very tender and the vegetables were fresh, but the meat seemed to be doused in the brown sauce and the dish was barely warm. I wish the skin and fat had been crisped up, but the flavors were still there. \\n\\nNext came the roti, and it is as lovely and delectable as everyone claims. If Indian naan and a French croissant had a love child, it would be called roti canai. Flaky and buttery on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside, this flatbread could probably satisfy someone as a meal all its own with a few more pieces. The creamy curry dipping sauce it comes with is the perfect taste bud dance partner for the roti. If you have some sauce leftover, I recommend getting extra roti or pouring it over rice. Superb. \\n\\nPrawn mee and five spice calamari came next, simultaneously. The prawn mee had a darker broth than the pictures other Yelpers have snapped of it, but this noodle soup was savory, hearty, and had a rich spicy undertone that crept up but didn't overwhelm (they can adjust hotness levels to your tastes). Chock full of noodles, shrimp, chicken, green onions, and an egg. Great for kicking that cold.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the five spice calamari was just okay. I'm not a calamari fan, so this dish was primarily ordered for my boyfriend. However, the texture of the fried squid was the most tolerable I've ever experienced, almost enjoyable (sorry, there's just something about the texture). But the spice mixture was on point, the pieces weren't overly breaded and they had a nice crisp to them.\\n\\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience with Hawkers, and I'm looking forward to trying out the Jax location.

Three of us ordered chicken and noodles. The noodles turned out to be half cooked and chicken seemed to be stale, it was throwing a stinking smell. A friend had ordered pad-thai, and thats the worst pad thai I have tasted in my life. I mean how can somebody go wrong with a pad-thai dish.

With a disgust look, she said - \\"I just made it fresh for you now\\" :D :D :D\\n\\nb. then we complained about the main course. Another waitress came and asked us whats wrong with the food? She heard our complaints and again went back to discuss something with the first waitress. Then the first waitress came back to ask the same question.

I had the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries, best I've had in awhile.  My wife had a burger that she said was very tasty, and the same with my daughter who had the fish sandwich.  The bill came to about $55 with a glass of wine that my wife enjoyed and a beer for myself which I think is on par with a place like the 99's.

However, too many unfortunate experiences have added up over time which has compelled me to write this review and rate Fresa's 2 stars...\\n\\n1) I had to cut out gluten for a while. I ordered two Tricky tacos on corn tortilla's to-go. I got home and noticed they were on flour. I had to eat the contents out of the tacos because I couldn't have gluten and didn't think it was worth it to drive back. \\n\\n2) I recently got a Power Bol. They didn't put any sweet potatoes in the bowl, which in my opinion is a big part of what makes this dish work. There was also just one small slice of avocado. For $13, this seems ridiculous.\\n\\n3) The service is just off. There is no other way of putting it. Sometimes they forget to fill your water, sometimes the waiters make weird, uncomfortable comments and they almost always seat you strangely. One time we asked to sit in a table in the shade because the sun was bright/hot. The hostess acted annoyed that we didn't want to sit in the sun because they were trying to even out the waiter/waitresses tables. No matter what, the customer's comfort should come first and we shouldn't feel bad for wanting to sit in the shade. \\n\\n4) I have found small hairs in my breakfast tacos on atleast four separate occasions.\\n\\nI'll just leave it at that..."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"always a great experience - never an issue with any order or service,,, pay for great & receive it,,, a return spot well-worth 30minutes drive"},{"name":"Bertucci's Italian Restaurant","address":"95 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"2.5","text":"Nothing any different from any other Bertucci's.

Although it's most definitely a Shakespearean reference of the highest order, I can't shake (pun intended) being reminded of \\"Steak and Ale,\\" that decidedly suburban temple to an '80s Saturday night out while the kids are with the sitter and wines didn't get anymore complicated than \\"red\\" or white.\\" I know this is an unfair knock and no stars have been deducted because of it. It's just an observation that probably says more about the observer than the observed.\\n\\n\\nSo how was it though? Having only been open briefly, kinks are still being worked out. Service, though attentive and sincere, was a still a bit slow. With time this, um, kinkiness should disappear posthaste. The liquor license hasn't appeared yet, so the complimentary glass of wine was a nice touch. The space was artfully arranged, consisting of blacks, whites and the muted grays of concrete almost as if Kenneth Cole stopped making clothes and took up interior design. The space was a far cry from the dark hard woods and Asian flair of the previous tenant, The Viet Chateau.\\n\\n\\nThe minimalism of the space extends to plate presentation as nary a garnish was found. I'm not exactly a garnish person, but, like the sport of hockey and the entire state of Wisconsin, some color would've been nice. But taste overrules all and the little restaurant that could definitely does. Deviled eggs, moussed and creamy, was what I imagine you'd bring to the church picnic--if that particular church happened to be located on St. Peter's Square. I also had the roast pork shoulder special that I consumed quickly and without regret.\\n\\n\\nThe following will mean nothing if you aren't Filipino, hung out with Filipinos, have never been to the Philippines or are taller than 5'7''; if you ain't brown, scroll on down. If you're still with me, the roasted pork tasted EXACTLY like lechon. Now believe me when I tell you that I've had pork in all shapes and sizes and, other than the traditional Filipino way of roasting a whole pig, I've never had pork actually taste like lechon. Even better, scattered throughout the mashed root vegetable side were pieces of chicharron (roasted pg skin.) You might imagine that being served, well, lechon, on anything other than a Styrofoam plate by some grinning auntie was a disconcerting experience for yours truly. Not an unwelcome one, mind you, just disconcerting. \\n\\n\\nI've given considerable thought to this dish over the past few days and I believe that I've come to a suitable explanation. Lechon is typically a whole pig roasted over a spit (or buried with charcoal.) Every pig I've ever seen this done to were smaller, raised naturally and unless they were associating with a spider friend gifted with preternatural spelling skills, Wilbur was always taken before he got too old. Cakes and Ale prides themselves on organic and locally sourced ingredients. I can only guess that the absence of commercially-grown pork is what led to the lechoniness of this specific dish. Either that or the chef has my dad locked away in the back. So, just for being able to replicate something that takes many hours, many beers, and many old, Filipino men to make, four stars."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"That sausage was so good!

And although they offer Dim Sum, I have yet to experience it. Strange, right? \\n\\nWhat makes it worthy of 4 stars? A few but mainly one of their dishes have stood out to me as irreplaceable. The dish? Their Mongolian Beef. The perfect spiciness, ingredients include: red chili peppers, green onions, beef over deep fried mung bean(?) noodles.

Either that or some other middle aged guy with his middle aged male partner taking pictures of every course.  But I digress.\\n\\nCakes and Ale is in downtown Decatur on East Ponce de Leon in the space formerly occupied by Viet Chateau.

The space itself squeezes into the weird overlap between minimalist decor and a relaxed atmosphere; about half the room was wearing jeans without looking underdressed.\\n\\nThe chalkboards on the walls were advertising specials focused on locally grown and farm-sourced ingredients, but we skipped the local pork special since we had a tenderloin of our own brining at home in the fridge.  Potato gnocchi with cabbage, green garlic, caraway seeds and crispy pork belly was pillowy soft, creamy, and redolent of the very best aspects of potatoes and pig.  Extremely satisfying comfort food.  The boyfriend's grilled skirt steak with arugula, parmesan, and balsamic vinegar was perfectly medium rare and an exercise in simplicity done right.  \\"I can't believe this is just arugula with salt, pepper, and vinegar!\\" he said, while refusing to give me any.\\n\\nOn that note, I should mention here that portions are not huge.  Nor are they small, however.  In fact, all the entrees we ate/saw were refreshingly moderate in size, which to me is a nice touch - I like being able to share an appetizer, order my own entree, eat it all, have some dessert, and not leave feeling absolutely stuffed.  Your mileage may vary depending on your eating habits, of course, but I for one appreciate something that falls in between \\"would you like a box for the rest of that?\\" and \\"$8 gets you this microscopic tapa, enjoy!\\"\\n\\nDessert: one order of chocolate pot de creme with candied kumquats.  One order of the house \\"phatty cakes\\": three soft ginger sandwich cookies with marscapone cream in between.  As a huge ginger cookie fan, the latter were a hit with me, although not as ginger-y as they could be (then again, I eat all the pickled ginger that comes with my sushi, so maybe I'm an abberation).  The boy reported that the pot au creme was excellent, although the candied kumquats, which were mixed in, were almost a bit overpowering.\\n\\nThe single service slip-up of the evening was our (otherwise helpful and competent) waiter's recommendation on what size coffee to order.  Cakes and Ale brews coffee by french press, which they bring to the table.  The small size isn't really two cups of coffee; at best, it's one and a half.  So we we got a little less joe than we intended, but enjoyed what we had.  Chalk it up to the soft opening; no doubt little stuff like this will get worked out as they get rolling.\\n\\nFinal conclusion?

Disclaimer: supposedly this place is great for brunch and offers a better food menu so this review will be for dinner \\n\\nAtmosphere: large outside seating area with long wooden tables and benches (aren't moveable) that are tightly placed near each other so limited wiggle room. It's a really nice and pretty place but very dim lighting so if you're going for dinner, you might have to turn on your phone flashlight to read the menu. There is a big stage located close to the table areas which I assume is for live bands. They do have some indoor seating as well but it's smaller. \\n\\nPrice: be expected to pay about $12-15 for one of their homemade sausage on a bun (with no sides included). Their appetizers are a bit cheaper from $8-$12 and their drinks are average at around $5-$8 for beers. \\n\\nFood: I got the large poutine (fries covered in gravy and cheese curds) to share and had some of my friend's drunken chicken sausage. I've had better poutine, the gravy is a bit bland and doesn't add as much flavor as I usually like on my fries which is why I probably wouldn't recommend it if you're a poutine lover like me. The chicken sausage came in a sweet bread with caramelized onions and some type of aioli. The sausage had jalape√±o bits in it which definitely gave it a kick, but I didn't think that the flavors mixed very well together. And I just don't think the price justifies the amount. Great beer selection though! \\n\\nOverall, this may be a place to stop by if you want some good beer.

I arrive armed with only a few bucks in cash, only to order something and then be told it's a cash only establishment.  I totally forgot.   Crisis averted, I get the moolah and move on, beverage in hand.  I then proceeded to order two items on the menu that were no longer available.  No problem, no problem.  I found an adequate substitution and my friends and me were on our way to having a spectacular evening.\\n\\nOur table was extremely wobbly, and though we put napkins underneath the shortest leg to try to temporarily fix the problem, it just wasn't working.  One by one, items fell off our table.  A fork.  Full glasses.  Empty glasses.  Another fork.  You get the idea.  Only when the staff came over to clean up the broken glass, we all got accused of being overly, wildly drunk.   As if we were purposely breaking these glasses.   We showed the staff the broken table leg, and I think they thought we were either insane, or somehow broke the table leg, too.\\n\\nWe got tossed for 'reckless behavior'.   \\n\\nTaking our rowdy little selves elsewhere to finish our night, I turned to my friends and asked if we'd seriously just been booted from Bukowski's.

Absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\nThe beer is also quite amazing. As the largest (I think?) brewery in Oregon, their year round beers are the epitomes of the their respective styles and the seasonals are always creative and quite delicious. The thing I love most is the random one-off beers that the Portland pub makes, but unfortunately they never last all that long.\\n\\nSo, why only 3 stars? Well, it has to be the food. I'm not really a huge fan of bar food in general, and the only thing Deschutes serves is glorified bar food at glorified prices. Some of their stuff is pretty alright, like the pretzel or some of the pizzas, but overall it's relatively uninspiring.

Michael's Bistro & Bar","address":"595 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"To me, the test of the true restaurant is how they serve and treat their guests on what might be considered a \\"discount\\" night. Using a Groupon. Coming in for happy hour. Or, in the case of my visit to G. Michael's Bistro, coming for Restaurant Week 2013 and trying their Prix Fixe menu. I love Restaurant Week because it gives me a chance to try excellent restaurants for a fraction of the regular price, it's helping a great cause(the Mid-Ohio Foodbank), and if it's good, that means I'll be coming back and paying the big bucks later. And for this joint, I will defiantly be coming back. \\n\\nFirst of all, this place is adorable. It's in a beautiful old brick building in German Village and while it appears small on the outside, the interior is actually really roomy and inviting. The bar is INCREDIBLE. The wine list is out of this world and my boyfriend and I both had a hard time choosing what to drink. The servers and host were very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had and the service was not slow at all. \\n\\nSecond of all, THE FOOD. SO GOOD. Since the Prix Fixe menu is one I don't believe they normally offer(or maybe it is and if not, it should be), you might not find these particular selections, but I'm sure the regular menu is just as good. For our first course, I started with the free form ravioli. It was pasta sheets with roasted vegetables(zucchini, eggplant, red onion, and spinach) in a garlic cream sauce. My boyfriend had the braised Ohio beef tongue(as always, he's a little more adventurous than me), but I did have a bite and it was delicious and came with roasted sweet potatoes and red cabage and a sweet and sour sauce. We both had the same entree for our second course. A 6oz USDA prime sirloin with creamy mac and cheese, a lobster and shrimp fritter, and grilled broccolini with a Dijon sauce. It was to die for. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and everything else on the plate was heaven. For dessert, we both had the Bailey's panna cotta and we had never had panna cotta before and now that dessert has two new fans. It was excellent. \\n\\nAgain, I can't emphasize enough how awesome it is that a restaurant, especially one considered one of the best in the city, would treat guests who aren't paying full price as awesome as G. Michael's did.

The tempura here is fantastic, not doughy like I've had elsewhere-- it's crisp, warm and delicious. And it comes arranged prettily on the plate.

It is on the way back from my boyfriends house and is an easy pit stop so they could have more of my business if every visit there wasn't so terrible. There are really no pros to this place other than location.\\n\\nCons: \\n\\n-Small store, limited selection of items\\n\\n-Little to no gluten free or vegan offerings-the Fred Meyer nearby has recently remodeled and expanded their health food section and Safeway is lagging behind\\n\\n-Every Safeway I have ever been to-including this one- is dramatically understaffed. They pay their staff garbage which is part of the problem-I had a friend that was a bakery manager for Safeway, going into work at 4am and she was getting paid a measly $14 an hour after 5 years of employment. The lines are long and it is very clear that the staff are unhappy with their jobs. \\n\\n-Safeway is overpriced. You can't save any money unless you buy 4 of everything or get their Friday deals. Sometimes meat is a good deal but it's because it's about to go bad and some are already at their expiration date when they are sold. Supermarkets unwrap food and throw it out when it isn't purchased-they are going to lose money on it anyway so they don't really care if they sell you something that might make you sick. Any kind of brown tint to meat means it is a huge risk.\\n\\nBUT MY MAIN COMPLAINT IS... THE PRODUCE IS ATROCIOUS! \\n\\nThe last time I came here I spent $225 on mostly produce because I have a limited diet for health reasons. Within only 2 days my food was rotting or disintegrating in my hands. I picked up a tomato only for it to squish apart immediately, with a grainy gross texture inside. No bugs had punctured the skin. Avocados that seemed perfect when purchased were brown on the inside and one even had some weird rust and white colored mold inside of it. Within 5 days I had thrown out $100 of wasted produce. I'm guessing that the produce was frozen and then defrosted for purchase. Or it was stored or transported improperly. Or maybe even returned and put back on the shelves. Who knows, but I have never had this happen anywhere else.\\n \\nThe cashier did a poor job packing my bags and put heavy items on top of fragile ones but there is no way it could have caused this much bruising, moisture and bacteria in my produce. I absolutely will not be back to shop here, no matter how close it is.

It's slightly deep fried in batter, almost taste like salt and pepper. The plate of sole, I was really impressed by. Not only it was cool to looked at, it was delicious too. They deep fried the whole sole and sticked it up vertically. On the middle is a stir fried corn nibblets on a bowl of crispy noodle then on the right side is deep fried soles without the bones.

If you want to get some before it sells out get there early because once its soldout you will have to wait till the next day, this is a sign of true slow cooked BBQ and is proof that he cares about quality and not just making a quick dollar by rushing his BBQ to produce and sell more.

How about serving it on the most obnoxious dinnerware possible, something that distracts the eye because this plain food did not dress it up. Really all it did was fill the empty void I call my stomach. \\n\\nInstead I sat enjoying my .5 liter Spaten Optimator and decided German beer contains enough bread, water and calories to satisfy any German needs I may have at Gustav's in the future."},{"name":"K Restaurant","address":"100 Lynn St","city":"Peabody","stars":"5","text":"This place is a hidden gem in Peabody Massachusetts. The menu is diverse and delicious. The service is excellent, and it's in a good space with lots of seating; it also has a parking lot so if you drive there, you don't have to look for parking. You could miss this place if you were driving by so if you have a chance definitely seek out K restaurant!!! Fantastic!!!!"},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"In terms of how lively it is, this is probably one of the dopest brunch situations I've seen. We went on a Sunday early afternoon/late morning and it was poppin. There was a brass band that played versions of popular Top 40 songs and you really haven't turned up at a brunch if you aren't shaking a little to Bruno Mars via a trumpet. Also, the beer list is insane. They have over 100 beers on tap, which means there is definitely something for everyone.\\n\\nWe waited about an hour to actually sit and be served (you can order beer and just find somewhere to hang out-they have open seating but they won't serve you if you're sitting in the open seating areas. Our server was new and she didn't quite understand the menu. I asked for a beer and she told me it could only be served as a float. That sounded weird because I wanted the ESB and I've never heard of a ESB as a float. It just doesn't sound like it works. Anyway. I moved on and ordered something else. She made a suggestion but it was far off from what I asked for. The sausage was ok. It was kinda dry and packed with some sort of mayo or something. I didn't finish it.\\n\\nThis is a cool place to stop in and grab a beer. That's about it."},{"name":"Garden Halal Meat","address":"96 Blackstone St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was very disappointed by the food here.

We ordered delivery from this restaurant to celebrate our airbnb host's birthday, so we figured that we would visit the restaurant again to enjoy the food there. However, it was a very disappointed experience. The restaurant was full when we went. They told us only the bar area was available; otherwise, we had to wait for 20-30 mins. At first, we decided to wait for a table. During the wait, another mom and little baby came in and chose to sit at the bar area. The waitress took orders from them not too long after they sat down. The baby was not tall enough to reach the bar when he sat at the stool and the restaurant didn't prepare any taller high chairs to accommodate. Since we were going to a concert right after dinner, in order to save some time, I nicely asked the front desk waitress to take our orders first. She was rude and said \\"no.\\" The mom who sat with her baby at the bar was surprised by the front desk lady's attitude as well. After that, I decided to sit at the bar in order to make it to the concert on time. Everything was slow except the speed they took my credit card when I tried to pay for our meal. The one star is for the kitchen staff, who are actually nice, and the food, which is decent."},{"name":"Passport Sips & Tapas","address":"59 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"I love Passport! It is a great place to come for a date night or to sit and enjoy a cocktail and some small plates with friends. The inside is well decorated, modern and romantic. The playlist is great. \\n\\nAs far as food goes, the mushroom ravioli, Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese never disappoint. The flan is also amaaaazing. Unfortunately the recipes have certainly changed from the previous owners and I have found some of the dishes are lacking flavor and can truly be hit or miss depending on the day. I do hope they expand their menu because it does not have as many choices as before. \\n\\nI have sat at the tables by the bar as well as in the restaurant itself and service from the waitresses has always been great. Sitting at the bar is a bit of a different vibe and the male bartender we've had could definitely be more attentive towards customers, but not bad if you don't care about that stuff.\\n\\nOverall, great spot to check out if you enjoy a chill, relaxing environment and tapas!"},{"name":"China Pacific","address":"107 Ranch Rd 620 S","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This place is an insult to the institute of Chinese food, Everything is awful.

The lobster Mac n Cheese was delicious as well but I will say it could have used a dash more salt in my opinion. \\n\\nAfter our meal our waiter ask about dessert and I was between the cheesecake and the flourless espresso chocolate cake. He told me that dessert was on him and that he would be back in a few. When he returned, he brought us a mini key lime pie cheesecake and a mini chocolate mousse cake.

The drinks are your normal drinks, with the exception that they always have one of two local/seasonal brews.  The food is also pretty classic pub food EXCEPT for their nachos!!!  This place has, hands down, the best nacho platter put together.  the one down side is that the waitresses are for the most part, a little \\"aloof\\", if you get my gist.  If you're looking to catch up with some friends for a laid back night, this is your place.
