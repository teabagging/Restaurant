The deep flavor of the charred beef tips combined with the sharp flavor of the peppers and pickles over the creamy beans made for a delicious dish.\\nSmoked butternut squash (M) -- A new, unique concept for butternut squash that worked well.\\nSummer squash (C) -- Disappointing after the first few dishes. Fresh, but nothing eventful.\\nPasta Maltagiati (M) -- again, well-prepared; a good texture, and a simple and light sauce\\nLamb confit (M) -- So-so. Tender, well-cooked meat, though the sauce was slightly sweeter than our tastes.

My partner had a truly delicious pumpkin soup featuring sassafras, black truffle, & malt powder in a serving that barely moistened the interior of the bowl; much less than a cup's worth.  I started with something described as Duck Confit with \\"cherries, beets, cous cous + curry,\\" which was served on a cold plate so as to return the 6 pitifully tiny pieces of duck to room temperature in the blink of an eye.  As served, there was no curry whatever, and precious little in the way of cherries, beets or, for that matter, cous cous.  At the completion of this \\"racion\\" (read: paltry appetizer), I went on to the Spanish Octopus with \\"celeriac, romesco, Tanzanian chocolate, lovage,\\" my second and final \\"racion.\\"  On the whole, this was a more generous portion, such as might satisfy a recently-fed two-year old.  The Tanzanian chocolate identified on the menu for this item would have been more faithfully represented as Tanzanian chocolate _dust_, a mere decoration rather than a comestible  Then, on to dessert: \\"Frozen Lemon Cream streusel, dark chocolate, Venus grapes.\\"  Again, a microscopic serving.  The two grapes were frozen.  But for Happy Hour, these scrawny delectables would have set us back $11 each, but we paid \\"only\\" $7 each, having arrived, if anything, a bit early.\\n\\nHappily, there are many other places in PDX that offer tapas (Toro Bravo, Andina, Tapalaya, etc.) in far greater variety and that represent far better value than what Racion is offering so far.\\n\\nOn a more positive note, I went in with a complex drink recipe \\"The Brave (http://liquor.com/articles/raising-the-bar-bobby-heugel/), and asked Courtney, the bartender, if he could duplicate it.

The signature dessert is cannoli, but I don like marscapone cheese.so we went with the seasonal selections.\\n\\nFor about the same money I would recommend Norman's in the adjacent hotel over this restaurant.

Breakfast and lunch foods both tasty."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"How the holy hell does this place have 3.5 stars? I really don't get it. It's like people have either a 5-star or a 1-star experience. Is it a Jekyll and Hyde thing? Or like the little girl with the curl on her forehead: when she was good she was very good, and when she was bad she was horrid?\\n\\nI went with my husband to meet up with some old friends. My friend suggested the place because she heard that they had an extensive and interesting beer menu. Well, since no Portlander in her right mind can resist an extensive and interesting beer menu,  and based on scanning the reviews here on yelp I thought the food should be decent, we decided to go.\\n\\nNumber 1: the service was really off. I am not sure if they just had one waiter or what. We were in a corner off from the main room, so it was hard to tell. The wait between getting the menus and ordering wasn't terrible, however the wait for everything else was really just too long. My friends ordered tastes of a couple of beers, and after getting their tasters it must have been 15 minutes before the waiter came back to see if they wanted a pint. I asked for a glass of water and never got it. I ordered a house made beer and it was OK. It's possible I would have a rave review of another one, but the service was so slow that I only ended up having one beer in our two hours there.\\n\\nNumber 2: the food was just awful. My husband ordered a burger as he always does, well done with fries, and ordered a cup of soup to start. I asked for a veggie burger with fries. I am a bad friend because I can't remember what my friends ordered... Something like 20 minutes later my husband asked me if I thought the waiter had heard him order soup. I said I thought so, but we would check when he came back. When the waiter finally came back with my friends' pints, I asked him, and he said yes, the soup was coming. Anyway, when the soup came it was at the same time as the main meal, boo! My husband immediately noted that his fries were stone cold and told the waiter. The waiter said he would bring more. I tried to tell him my fries were cold too, but he was walking away as I said it, so I guess he didn't hear me. \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for the new fries, my husband noted that his well-done burger was really red on the inside, and also cold! My veggie burger was cold, too. However, I had just fully recovered from a stomach bug and hadn't eaten in a couple of days, so I just wanted to eat it, because apparently hunger trumps fear of food poisoning. When the waiter came back with the fries, my husband showed him the rare burger and said that it was cold. The waiter said all the right things, his burger was comped, what can I bring you on the house, etc. However, at that point, everyone who was too hungry to care about food poisoning was half-way done with their meal, so what was the point? \\n\\nSo, would I try this place again? Maybe I would if I was going to sit at the bar and just drink beer.

Perfectly seasoned without the overbearing vegetables and just the right amount of egg I asked for. I've had their pork fried rice, chicken fried rice, shrimp friend rice and house fried rice and I've never been disappointed in my own food.

Portion size was enough that I was able to take half home and have another meal.\\n\\nMy second visit I ordered the Garlic Chicken. Now with Garlic Chicken you just never know what type of veggies you'll get with it. I was hoping it wouldn't be loaded with bamboo shoots and celery (my least fave veggies in Chinese food) and I wasn't disappointed. It had quartered water chestnuts, which was great, gave the food a really nice crunch. It also had some peppers, onions and other veggies I can't remember but thankfully, NO celery or bamboo shoots. The sauce was good, not great but I was again, happy with my choice. Again, I was able to take half the food home and have another meal. \\n\\nContrary to another review, the servers on both occasions were very friendly and helpful. If I asked for something the server didn't understand, they immediately grabbed someone who had a better grasp of English. Certainly not something I mind at all. Also, the portions are on par with other Chinese restaurants. Are they HUGE? No, but they're definitely adequate to the point where you have enough to take home for another meal and if you eat the soup and wing before hand, you can take the eggroll home with you :)\\n\\nI love this place and it will be my go to Chinese restaurant unless I end up moving out of the Sandy Springs area."},{"name":"Bancroft & Co","address":"210 Andover St","city":"Peabody","stars":"3.5","text":"Love almost everything about this place!\\nDiscovered it in Burlington originally so i was excited to see it appear in Peabody. \\nFirst off, the service is great and the way the tables are set up giving you a nice private feel is incredible.\\nThe food is wonderful but the prices are high.

The marinated tofu was very flavourful that the bowl doesn't really need the salad dressing sauces, as I normally request for all sauces to be put on the side. The bowl also came with a scoop of guacamole with a nice lime flavour to it. Add in the fresh wasabi peas for crunch and texture... they are to die for and highly addictive! \\n\\nThe chef, Ryan, and the Management have been very accommodating on changing my bowl to fit my dietary need - and even surprised me by adding in steamed cauliflowers!

We ordered a bottle of wine, he came back to let us know they were out of them, then, he came back to tell us that one was available, to later confirm that none were there.  We were predispose to have a good time so it was funny, but not everybody will see it that way.\\n\\nI ordered the Carbonara pizza, not good, the dough was not well cooked as the slices bend downwards and it wasn't tasty at all, even though I'm a carbonara aficionado.  I tried the lamb and was magnificent, well cooked with the juices to overflowing the dish.  My wife has the appetizer Gnocchis which were excellent, maybe needing a little sauce to top them of, instead of the accompanying reduced balsamic vinegar under them.  Here it could be a matter of taste.  \\n\\nOverall, an ok fun place, over rated, with a rich menu that can be better presented.  I'm surprised to read reviews that state great pizzas, come on !!!  I had better, a lot better.

Dos Equis would complete the authentic taco stand feel the best though (with about 6-7 stray dogs running around too). \\n\\n2. The tortillas were way too soggy because of the salsa.

I got the Mary Pickford martini, which was very good, and a nice change from some of the more traditional drinks that you find on many menus. As for our entrees, I got the pork chop, which was very good and well-portioned for the price. However, my husband's salmon was a portion more suited for what you'd expect as an appetizer - it was extremely small, and he was finished with his meal when I was less than halfway done with mine. And for $30, we were pretty disappointed with his meal as a whole.\\n \\nAs other's have mentioned, nearly everything on the menu is significantly over-priced, especially for the location and demographics.

The waitress seemed distracted and I had to call her over to order Miso soup and Tea, which took forever to arrive. There were two Sushi chefs there, they never once asked me if I wanted anything, in fact they never made eye contact or acknowledged I was there. The Sushi choices were for the most part ridiculous mounds of Rice with fat laden sauces trying to look fancy, and several deep fried choices. The whole time I was there, there was only one plate of raw fish, some Tuna, I grabbed that. The Miso Soup was by far the worst I have ever had(How do you mess that up?) and the few rolls I tried fell apart. To top it off the waitress who was spending most of the time talking to the chef was very un-interested in serving me or any of the other patrons,(Which were very few, no surprise) so in a city known for poor service, she was able to go to top of the list for that.

As I was becoming hungrier and hungrier, I grew impatient and decided to try opening the door. Ta-Da! The door was open and they were open for business... It was just that they have their windows/door tinted, so the store front always looks dark...Sneaky sneaky Yuzu  ._.\\"\\n\\nWe both ordered the Kakuni Ramen. BEST KAKUNI EVER! The braised pork belly was extremely tender as if it would melt the minute you put it in your mouth. The kakuni was crazily crazily tasty. The soup base was also made perfectly, the flavor was not too strong nor was it fatty. It was just about right. The ramen noodles is the only blemish in an otherwise perfect Ramen. Personally, I think the noodles lack a bouncy texture to them and that they were made a little too thin. (Or perhaps, straight ramen noodles are just not my cup of tea.) Otherwise, it would have been the \\"perfect bowl\\". We were both filled up after our ramen and were unable to try other side dishes, but I will definitely come back if I'm visiting Portland again!"},{"name":"Noodlebox","address":"1867 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"My family and I love this place.

We had the pork belly (special that isn't on the menu), escargot, and foie gras and they were excellent. \\n\\nThe main course was very good. Our party had a number of dishes ranging from a beef stew to lamb shanks to seafood. Everyone was happy with the food. \\n\\nCons: Service was a bit slow. We arrived at the tail-end of the Saturday dinner rush so I can understand how it can be slow for entrees to be delivered, particularly to a party of six.

Read on...\\n\\nThe evening started off with a bad taste in my mouth.  Upon arrival Saturday night with my three companions at 6:50, I explained to Chris, acting as the ma√Ætre d', that we wanted to enjoy cocktails at the bar, before being seated for our 7:30 reservation. Though he said he could seat us immediately, I repeated our desire to enjoy drinks first at the bar.  At 7:10, Chris came back up to me at the bar and advised me that our table was ready.  We were still in the middle of our first round of drinks, and he really pressured me to be seated.  So as not to make a scene in front of my dinner party, I relented and we were then seated.  It should not have been an issue for them, as both the bar and the restaurant were only half full, and we were still quite early for our actual reservation.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, the service picked up dramatically, as Colin, our waiter, and Mark, the beverage director made us very comfortable and were very attentive to us the remainder of the evening.  The menu was extensive, and creative. The menu is divided into thirds, which is becoming more common, offering appetizers (presumably for one), small plates to share, and main plates.\\n\\nWe started with the smoked seafood platter for the table while we perused the rest of the menu for our selections.  This was a trio of preparations, and was a good way to start.  We next ordered our individual starters, sharing a bite.  This included the cup of clam chowder @$9 (see photo), seafood/ceviche cocktail (see photo) @ $12, which was spicy, meaty, and very tasty.  The ladies ordered off the middle of the menu for their main, and were satisfied. This was the cassoulette of seafood sausage (see photo) and the fried clams (see photo), both at $15.  My main plate of braised black bass was a reasonable portion of fish, and moderately flavorful.\\n\\nThe selections of wines by the glass should be expanded, but were reasonably priced at $10.

We felt like we were just loitering and standing over the other customers waiting for them to leave.  They have an outdoor area, where we were directed, but then we were told to just keep an eye on the tables inside to wait for someone to leave.  We couldn't see the tables inside from the outdoor area, so it was really inconvenient.  Also, the heaters weren't working, so we were freezing.  We would have at least liked them to put our name on a list or something so that our \\"place\\" in line was saved.  \\n\\nAs for the food, we thought it was excellent.

My pastrami omelette with hash browns was both piping hot and tasty.\\n\\nMy everything bagel was good but there was almost not enough cream cheese to spread over it. I think this place is a bit chinsy / stingy with the cream cheese servings as well as some other menu items.\\n\\nChinsy / stingy servings of certain menu items is just one of many problems I have encountered at this restaurant . In my most recent visit my mom and I went here and we sat waiting for an hour drinking coffee before being served our food. I had ordered pretty much the same meal as in the previous visit except that this time I got a corned beef omelette instead of a pastrami omelette.\\n\\nWe almost canceled our order after we had realized we had been waiting nearly an hour. To make matters worse, the table next to us got their food before we did (even though we had arrived and were seated before them).\\n\\nOur waiter, who looked like a young Jim Gaffigan, kept telling us our order would be coming out shortly. At one point he even gave us some Kosher half-sour pickles to munch on while we waited; a nice gesture to be sure, but I'd rather get my food order in a more timely fashion. At one point we tried to cancel our order and leave but Young Jim G. assured us our food would be right out. We got our food maybe ten minutes later.\\n\\nWe were also told by the waiter (and later the cashier) that the restaurant was presently short-handed in the kitchen. He assured us that they were about to hire more personnel so we would not have the same problems in future visits. When we checked out at the register to pay our bill, we complained about the long wait and they gave us a 10% discount ( a kind remedy albeit a weak one) . We were told yet again that they were going to hire more help.\\n\\nWaiting for over an hour for our food is a very serious problem! And yet a problem that the managers / owners appear to accept rather casually. I may not ever return here because of that issue - regardless of the rationale. \\n\\nThere are just too many other decent restaurant choices in this neighborhood. One other popular Jewish Deli is on the other side of the shopping center while yet another is perhaps a mile away across the street from Emory and The CDC.

Drinks were reasonably priced, service was decent, & food had a seasoned Mexican flavor.  For around 7-8 bucks, I would feel stuffed with the portion sizes.  Moreover, the atmosphere on the patio was great where my good friends & I could enjoy a margarita or two & not have to worry about rushing in & out within 30 minutes.  The restaurant did a decent job of keeping the Mexican authenticity of its food, drinks, & following the all-important custom of the customer asking for the check when they were ready (versus handing you the bill first).  I would tip Antonio or one of the servers a decent amount and get on with my evening.\\n\\nNow, here's the kicker.  Cazuela's became so busy over the years that they began compromising their food standards while raising prices.  Naturally, I understand that food prices will rise with inflation & that a small business has to be more efficient when serving more customers.  At the same time, jacking up dinner prices, lowering portion sizes, and making the food very bland will not fool anyone that is accustomed to authentic Mexican cuisine.  For example, their enchilada sauce (claimed to be house-made) tasted like they dumped a cold can of tomato paste on top of the tortilla.  The salsa isn't too bad when the cilantro is actually freshly chopped, but has a rather runny type consistency.  In turn, I usually ask for the pico de gallo.  That specific instance made me reluctant to order food for quite some time (and for good reason).\\n\\nI'm a reasonable person and like to give people the benefit of the doubt if the food doesn't taste too bad.  Mexican food we experience here in the United States is a Tex-Mex adaptation with every meal starting with tortilla chips and salsa.  When I was studying in M√©xico, lunch or dinner began with a bowl of limes, green & red chile sauce w/ fresh baked French bread.  This occurred in multiple cities (Mexico City, Puebla, Morelia, & Guadalajara) incase any of you plan on visiting in the near future.\\n\\nMy point is anyone that tells you Cazuela's is the most authentic Mexican food is probably doing you a disservice to your ethnic food pallet and wallet.  Yeah, I know it's Ohio and what do you expect to hear from lots of white people that claim their food \\"has too much kick\\" after a few shakes of cumin powder on their taco/chimichanga.  On a side note, it is hilarious to see a bunch of (mainly) drunken idiots attempt the Mucho Macho Burrito challenge.  The rules are listed on the wall if you or one of your friends feels the urge to taste a burrito doused in haba√±ero juice to the point where your labrador retriever wouldn't even consume such matter.  I warned you, don't be like my friend & burn 12 bucks only to piss off your digestive system the next morning.\\n\\nOn the positive side of things, I will give credit to Cazuela's for having a vegetarian section on the menu.  There are a decent number of options, and the menu does a decent job at explaining the contents of each dish.  If I am really hungry, I usually order the vegetarian fajitas if you want to call it my food recommendation.  For the carnivores, I hear the carnitas & chicken is decently flavored, but don't take a veteran vegetarian's word for it (we have other reviews for a reason).    \\n\\nTasty margaritas with multiple flavor options & a decent outdoor patio make Cazuela's has a good atmosphere if you just want to chill and have drinks with friends or make it a casual date.  Senior crawl & OSU home football Saturdays, not so much.  Happy hour pricing is decent from 10-11 p.m.   However, it is best to go during the week versus on the weekend when all the regular OSU students come en masse  with their huge 18.99 margarita glasses (that can be refilled at a discounted rate).  It's a nice concept if you go there a lot, but I'm still going to call it highway robbery even at the lower price.\\n\\nFor anyone that chooses to go based on this review, I wish you and/or your friends a good experience and decent weather follows as well.  The patio truly is a great place to people watch or wind down from a long day of classes without the noise of an annoying DJ ruining the atmosphere with some cliched radio promotion.

Purchased as a Groupon, which usually leaves me disappointed,but this restaurant changed that. Called to make a reservation, per Groupon site, and was greeted by the most pleasant gentleman. Asked if anyone dining had allergies, did we have a preference of booth or table, were any children joining us. Greatly appreciated the extra customer service.\\n2. The owner, also the gentleman on the phone greeted us upon our arrival, great personality. When my two and four year started getting loud, and I was trying to get them to whisper, he came right over and asked the girls \\" why are you girls being so quiet, that's not fun!\\" Definitely made us feel comfortable.\\n3. I am not usually a crab Rangoon fan, but it was very good. The chicken satay was probably best I have ever had, super juicy, not the dry jerky like I usually get at other places. And a special app, scallion wrapped duck with cucumbers and a spicy dipping sauce, the two year old loved it too. For entrees, crispy duck fried rice and the beef kra pow, each enjoyed by the entire table. We ordered a side of steamed string beans for the table and they were just perfect. They were actually, haricot verts, that they cook in a light sauce, and they were cooked to perfection. What a pleasant surprise they turned out to be. Fried ice cream for the girls dessert, was just ok. The outside coating was slightly undercooked, making it gummy tasting, but the kids quickly got to ice cream center. \\n4. We only have 4 out 5 stars for the following reasons:\\n- our waitress was not friendly at all, didn't crack a smile, made us feel like we were bothering her.\\n- would like to a better wine list & cocktails to highlight the high quality food.\\n- the kra pow dish did not contain these delicious spicy green peppers(they had only bell peppers in it) that I have had at every other Thai restaurant.\\n- they won't deliver to my house in Winthrop!

She then rolled her eyes and walked away to grudgingly get me another cup. Another waitress came over to my table and inspected my old glass of water with the brown speck in the glass and told me it was a lemon. First of all I know what a lemon looks like. That brown floating particle is not a lemon. Second of all who are you woman? You're not even my waitress and you only came to my table to interrupt my meal to tell me I'm wrong.

I ordered everything to go, sat down to wait for my food to be prepared, and noticed there were a few other patrons sitting on the stools throughout the room, none of whom were eating.... It felt a little bizarre... A few other people came in after me, and now there were a decent number of people all sitting around in a restaurant not eating. I decided to ignore the awkwardness in anticipation of some funky chips and scrumptious veggie burger, and I'm glad I did. My order came up a few minutes later, and I can happily report that Lotus Chips are my new favorite thing.

The beer temperature/flavor was average at best, but if you want another one, be prepared to wait for one of the 10 people behind the bar to realize that you're still there. The only way I can describe the service here is to say that when you're a brand new restaurant, you may want to hire at least one bartender who knows how to perform the job. I literally stood and waved my arms for a minute trying to get a beer, but the \\"bartender\\" who was 10 feet away from me was too busy catering to the owner's friend to give me the time of day. And whatever you do, don't try to talk to the \\"manager/owner\\" about any issues because they will quickly assume that you have had too much to drink and ask you to leave. I found myself confused as to what had just happened as I was evidently \\"86'd\\" after having two beers. Not really a good business model if you ask me.

He had finished his dinner when I got my dosa. On top of that, the server brought me someone else's dosa . I was fuming. How long does it take to make a damn dosa. The couple next to me started talking. She too said their quality has gone down. She complained of her food, and the guy literally put his face down on her plate to smell it.

The veggie spring rolls were pretty good, though, and my glass of wine hit the spot after a long day. \\n\\nI would say that the service here definitely offsets the food in many ways. Tonight, we had a server who was friendly and funny, and even kept me entertained while I waited for my friend to arrive. When she got there, he helped guide her through the menu, and was incredibly easy-going at the end of the night when she and I both paid cash and they didn't have enough change. He couldn't break our $20s so we could leave a decent tip and didn't even seem bothered by it. While I was still chilling by myself, they asked if I'd be willing to move over one table so they could accommodate a large party. Even though I was more than happy to help out, they comped me a glass of wine to make up for the inconvenience.\\n\\nSo yes, don't expect too much here, but at the same time, you should certainly be able to appreciate Ru San's for what it is, rather than what it is not.

I enjoy their lunch/dinner menu, especially their Beechwold salad, pad thai and fish sandwich. \\n\\nMy main issue with Northstar is that I believe they are ridiculously overpriced. On one occasion I ordered the cloud nine pancakes for $11.50 and had three small, unremarkable, tasteless pancakes brought out to me. The ginger ale which costs $4 is very small and filled with ice, so it can be finished in just a few sips. Splurging on excellent food to me is often justified because food = life, but every time I'm at Northstar I get the feeling that I'm being ripped off because the food is good but not thatttt good. \\n\\nIn terms of this location, the Clintonville branch is the least impressive aesthetically out of the three, but has a cozy vibe and quite a number of outdoor seats.

I really liked the look of the place, especially in the back with the stone walls, although we were seated at a large semi-circular booth.  \\n\\nThen things started to go pear-shaped.  Two lowlights from our visit:\\n\\n1) Davide recently had a visit from Gordon Ramsay, so I understand the menu has been revamped.  However, our server was not particularly familiar with any of the changes.  We had a long, two or three minute struggle where I attempted to order the vegetarian bruschetta sampler while pointing at it on the menu and he would confirm, \\"Yes, the meat plate.\\"  It was very frustrating.  Apparently the charcuterie used to be o that spot on the menu, but it would have been solved if he would just look at the words I was pointing at.  (The bruschetta, when it came, was pretty good.  I really liked the one with white bean dip on top)\\n\\n2) Another server interaction:  we ordered two glasses of prosecco, but got something else.  It was distinctly buttery.  I don't really drink un-sparkling whites, so I'm not sure whether it was chardonnay or sauvignon blanc, but it wasn't prosecco.  I felt bad, because we'd just had the interchange above, but I tried to gently suggest our server had poured the wrong wine.  My companion said helpfully, \\"There's no bubbles.\\"  Our server's response?  \\"You must have waited too long to drink it.  There were bubbles before!\\"  I was flabbergasted.  The owner ended up overhearing this and got us the right wine, but prior to that our server had said, \\"If you want to complain, I'll get you a different glass, but that's the right wine.\\"  (The prosecco, when it came, was lovely)\\n\\nOur other dishes were fine.  My friend got the carpaccio, which she enjoyed, and the ravioli, which I think she liked too.  They earned the other star.  I ordered the gnocchi, which was slightly overcooked but decent.\\n\\nIn short, the confrontational service basically ensured that I won't go back here for awhile.  The server also said a few other things that I can't remember, but at the time made us feel uncomfortable.  \\n\\nWould not recommend."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Had a spectacular brunch today before heading over to soak up the springtime sun at Jamaica Pond.  The place was about half full around 1pm on Sunday, so no wait at all.  We were greeted with a bottle of tap water and a homemade flatbread (had a granola-type consistency) with butter.  Given the interesting cocktail menu, I tried the gin and ginger beer cocktail (somehow the name is escaping me), while my boyfriend had the Sunset Song, which was mango infused scotch.  It was excellent, though a bit too strong of a drink for my taste.  We both split the boozy fruit salad, which had finely chopped mint and Drambuie to accompany the fresh blueberries, honeydew, cantaloupe, and pineapple.  The brunch menu is on the small side, though there were definitely some tasty choices.  We both decided to order the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  It was definitely a different spin on a classic dish, but they definitely did it justice!  The english muffins were replaced with fried potato patties that contained the smoked salmon.  The eggs were a little beyond poached, but that was fine by me.

The waitress, at least, was prompt and attentive, even though it was busy when I arrived.  The cheesesteak was a little smaller than what I was expecting, and used a fair amount of provolone, but the cheese was simply left to melt on top.  Some avid cheesesteak makers will grill the meat with the cheese for a thorough mixing of the cheese to ensure a complete and seared melt.  It did however come out fairly hot which made it more appetizing.The steak itself was broken up into small bits as it should be, and grilled well.

Add in the continuously refilling HOT mini-loafs of italian white bread with the herb-infused EVOO dipping oil, and whoa - this meal was starting out NICE!  And then...\\n\\nThe main meal arrived.  So...my salad was plated on a medium sized oval, yet, hardly filled half the plate.  The chicken breast, while hot, was DEFINITELY not genetically modified, as it was hardly noticeable on the plate.  While it was smoky tasty, it had an interesting consistency of...giblet-infused?  It was...\\"different\\".  The salad itself was tasty, albeit, salty (wait, if I could go back and start this over, I'd have to say almost EVERYTHING was salty!!).  Everything as described was on the plate...chicken breast, mixed-green salad, egg, bacon, and sliced grape tomatoes.  If you blinked while I ate it - you missed it!  It was that incredibly small.  It definitely lacked the OOMPH I was looking for...\\n\\nWife's pasta:  So...yeah, the portion was really disappointing for the price.  The plate was a little larger than my salad plate, but the pasta was spread so thin on the plate as if to make it seem like a fuller portion.  It had a good taste, albeit...you guessed it...salty, and came up short on sufficient alfredo compliment.  When asked for an additional \\"side\\" of alfredo, it came almost entirely watered-down like alfredo soup!\\n\\nWe could go in to an assessment of our lil one's meal, but how much can be said about...spaghetti and a meatball.  Well, you could say...salty...but I think I've abused that descriptor by now...\\n\\nSo...as a final note.  One of the on-duty working Managers stopped by our table as a routine, and asked how dinner was.  While I wasn't going to say anything on my own, this did present the opportunity for me to just say how I felt.  At this point in the meal, we knew why it had been years since we were last at Carrabbas, and why it will probably be years before we return.  I didn't come off arrogant or disgruntled; just, overall and generally disappointed.  And that seemed to have an impact on the female Manager (sorry, forgot her name) whom this conversation took place with.  She was genuinely disappointed herself that we were disappointed.  She insisted on making it right...giving us another salad, giving us a dessert...wanting to do something.  I'm not about the freebies, or trying to take advantage of a situation.  I expressed to Her that the purpose for my expressed assessment was to give her proper feedback.  Well, on the way out the door, I was presented with a compensation in hopes of us returning to give it another try.\\n\\nWe might...but we won't be rushing out to do so.  Restrictive economic times call for smart and decisive decisions.  I can't say you shouldn't go...but two things to highly consider:  Size proportion/cost, and salt content.  Many previous reviews have touched-upon the portion sizes = costs, and they are clearly accurate.\\n\\nBon Appetite!"},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had a great time with the girls out at Kobe!

As for Dan's, they definitely belong in the fast food group and they definitely earn their press.\\n\\nBeyond the burgers - and wow are they delicious - I really enjoy the no-frills service and the no-nonsense atmosphere.

Your going to one of the best restaurants on the busiest month (magical dining) of course it's  super busy and it's ridiculous to expect the restaurant to only cater to you and give you the table You demand. You must not have a clue how the restaurant industry works if someone before you was sat in that section you wanted, you will be sat elsewhere called rotation for the servers. Some of the top restaurants can have as many as 1000 guests. They are not going to mess up the floorplan. There is a method to how tables are a sat, not just choose any seat you want. Sure they can do that on most nights, accommodate your seats but not on magical dinning. I worked at high end restaurants in Disney and know first hand.

I guess i should have read more about it. I expected it to be a regular ol' pizza joint, not a modernist \\"bougie\\" restaurant/bar/wanna-be-club. And i don't mean that in a bad way... it was just unexpected. I found the whole concept of ordering your food on an ipad a little off-putting, but then i began to like it. As someone else said here, it is kinda nice that they don't have to ask you what you want to order b4 you've had time to decide, so you just order when you're ready. But apparently the ipod-ordering process isn't perfect because we ordered 3 pizzas, two of which were special orders, and they got one of the special orders perfect while the other was not. We asked for the shrimp pizza to have pizza sauce instead of garlic cream sauce and it came out with cream sauce. But ironically, there were two silver linings to this mistake. First, the shrimp pizza w/ garlic cream sauce was freaking delicious. Second, we got two pizzas for one because they brought us another shrimp pizza w/ the correct pizza sauce free of charge! Good customer service there!   \\nBut back to the pizza, all three/ four of the pizzas were quite delicious. We had the cheesburger pizza and the pepperoni/mushroom pizza in addition to the shrimp pizzas. I was quite impressed. I mean it's not like gourmet Sicilian, Milanese, or whatever pizza, it's just good, tasty, Americanized pizza. And contrary to what another reviewer said, i think prices were a good bargain. To be \\"personal-sized\\", these pizzas were quite large and filling and they were only around $10. And they honored the ScoutMob w/o any unforeseen stipulations like \\"only honored on a full moon\\". \\nAs far as a few negatives, it did take more than 45 minutes for us to get our pizzas, which is getting into ridiculous territory. No restaurant should make you that long... 30 mins, ok, but over 45, no way. And i would have preferred to have another option than valet parking, but i didn't sweat that too much. It is what it is. Like i said, i was just surprised that the restaurant was so \\"bougie\\", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\nI didn't like that they seated us at a wrap-around couch-type thing instead of a table even though we asked can we please sit at at table, and they told us that they could only seat reservation-guests at a table... although we did have a reservation, but oh well, we let that go.\\nOn a positive note, i definitely enjoyed the view from the second (or third?) floor.

Although it would have been nice to label the bathroom as \\"Restroom Here\\" instead of just calling it \\"Confessional\\", leaving you to figure it out for yourself. Thank goodness i was clever enough to figure it out or else i would have had to pee on myself.  \\nI want to give it 4 stars, but for some reason, that feels a little high, mainly because we had to wait so long for our food and because they wouldn't seat us at a table.\\nBut overall, i think they're on the right track."},{"name":"Edamame Sushi & Grill","address":"3946 Morse Crossing","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a great restaurant!

I really did. I had a birthday dinner here a few nights ago with 10 people. I changed the reservation a few times and everyone I talked to was extremely accommodating. We were seated immediately out on the patio, which is beautiful. \\n\\nOur server greeted us and seemed friendly enough. BUT THEN, our party started to arrive and we started ordering food. We got an extremely condescending speech about how it would easier if we could all order food and drinks at the same time so he wasn't \\"running around like crazy\\". I understand the entrees, of course, but even drink orders. When someone would order another drink he would scoff and reiterate that it would \\"easier if...\\". I'm sorry that my ten friends and I are not drinking at the same pace. Sorry dude, but we're paying you to bring us shit. He then proceeded to describe the wine to my friend, who works at Uchiko and is likely more knowledgeable than he is, as if the closest thing she's ever had to good wine is grape juice. \\n\\nThe drinks were good. I spent the majority of the night drinking a cucumber drink which was extremely refreshing. Everyone else seemed happy enough with their cocktails and the wine list was extensive. Granted, each drink is about $10 or more each, and actually somewhat small, but that's to be expected.\\n\\nDifferent people in the group ordered \\"bites\\", which he described as being served family style. Bites, of course, means that the appetizer is so small it is a literal bite. Served family style (duh). While this certainly is not a difficult concept, our waiter could have done much more to ensure appetizers were properly apportioned. They were brought out and set right in front of two people that had ordered two of the same \\"bites\\" my friend and I had ordered. Why weren't they put in the middle? We figured they split our orders since we were on opposite sides of the table.. He didn't come back out for a good while, and we he finally did, the two had already eaten what was put in front of them. And trust me, it really was \\"a bite\\". We asked if there was more coming and, looking rather exasperated, he reminded it was family style and they were all served on one plate. He didn't give us any direction, and provided no reminder to us when he set it down on the OPPOSITE side of the table. Again, not a difficult concept, but a little friendly reminder would have been helpful. Eventually, I think he offered to bring us out another portion but he was so rude about it, we decided against it. \\n\\nThe entrees finally came out. I ordered the Branzini (a type of fish) and a friend and I split one of the pastas. The pasta was a lamb mac and cheese which was really good. Not amazing, but it was solid. All of their meats are cooked on a wood-fired grill but mine was way too charred and a bit under-seasoned. I'm a huge fan of that smokey grill flavor but it almost tasted burnt. Same with the friend next to me who had the pork chop. It was decided that the \\"bites\\" were the best, but we missed out on that.\\n\\nAll in all, the ambiance is great, the cocktails were great, albeit a bit overpriced, and the food was good. Not the best I've had in Austin, but good. It seemed to me the pastas and appetizers are their strong point and, who knows, maybe it was just an \\"off night\\" for the meats.  I think the service really put a damper on the whole thing for me, especially on my BIRTHDAY. I mean, give a girl a little ass-kissing or something, not an attitude. I felt our server treated our group as a bunch of kids who wouldn't tip and knew nothing about wine or food. I guess the joke's on him as many of us worked in the restaurant industry at one point or another and would happily tip over 20% for good service. I would give it a second try but I'd definitely hope for another server, and would try to go to happy hour to avoid spending an excess of $50 for another disappointing meal."},{"name":"Maggiano's Little Italy","address":"1601 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with a few friends.

It didn't even come close to the quality of the food or the individual service you'll find at the Pongal. First, if your not Indian you might feel out of place since most of the patrons of this restaurant are Indian. Second, from the outside it looks closed. Not sure why they don't get a big open sign to hang outside. But once you get in, sit down and the attentive wait staff comes over to get your order all is forgotten. On my last visit I asked a question about teh difference of two pannier dishes. The waiter not only explained the different ingrediance in the two dishes, he brought me out two forms of seasoning, the seeds and the herb leaf to taste. The food is cooked to order. Don't see it on the menu? They will make it. Want no salt, or no wheat, they can do that. Their service goes beyond mild, hot and spicy and will create a dish to your choosing. Consistency is something I appreciate. Ive brought first time Indian food eaters and they have loved it. I have never had a bad meal and the saag paneer and chicken tikki Marsala are amazing. The breads are fresh and served to order. Wine and beer prices are extremely reasonable and you can eat drink and be merry for around 60.00. The decor is pleasant the the plating stylish.

I was pleased to find a place that was:\\n1) Close to me\\n2) Created by a Chef I watched and enjoyed on Top Chef\\n3) Claimed to have real Texas style BBQ\\n\\nThe first two, you pass with flying colors.  The last, it was one of the better attempts I have had.  I will say, I am used to the upscale BBQ idea, as I work right next to one in downtown Austin.  That is where you lose a star.  You owe Lamberts BBQ a thank you and a reference for taking every idea they have in creating upscale BBQ in downtown ATX.  From the menu, to the sauce bottles, to the side items, to the serving plates, and the layout; this was a transplant of Lamberts.  If Apple can patent rounded corners, you guys would be in trouble if Lamberts decided to start enforcing its brand. \\n\\nThat aside, the BBQ was good.  The brisket could have used some more smoke and a bit more care to ensure that fat rendered, but the bark was a pretty color and tasted great.  The pork, was all around amazing.  Granted it was the fancy variety, but it had smoke, flavor, and delicious fat.  Great job.  Sides were all nice and a good portion.  All in all a bit expensive, even for the fancy style que.  I have made it to four BBQ places in Boston now, and this is good, and the closest to traditional Texas style with a New England flair in a haute environment.\\n\\nAlmost forgot to mention.  You have lonestar beer.... for $5.  In Texas, you would get laughed out of town.  Lonestar is the beer that every place charges $2 for the 18 ounces can just because it is tradition.

Oh how I regret having suggested this place. Thai Express costs nearly half the price and tastes much better. I ordered the Coconut chicken and there were only 4 small pieces of chicken in a small bowl. I was chalking this down to  overpriced and mediocre food, but it quickly escalated to simply the worst experience I have EVER had in a restaurant. After eating, as I was heading to the restroom, one of the servers was chatting near the counter and decided to turn around at the exact moment I was passing, hitting me on the shoulder with a bowl of curry noodles. I'm lucky I have pretty good reflexes and sort of dodged or stepped back as the food spilled all over my clothes or I'd have been doused with the hottest portion of noodles and soup at the bottom of the bowl. As the bowl came down and smashed right at my feet, I'm also very lucky I was wearing boots, which got completely plastered with hot curry sauce. Had I been wearing sandals and shorts I'd be nursing burns and cuts. Don't these servers have to do some safety training? At the very least I'd expect them to pay attention to what they are doing. And chasing  me, the customer, into the restroom to hand me a couple of cloths so I can clean myself up like you are doing me a favor, without even apologizing until much later is just not cool; neither is saying \\"hey, it was an accident\\". Giving me a card for a free meal on the house to make up for it as I was leaving only added insult to injury; like I could use it to pay the dry cleaners to get the stains out of my clothes... or do they really think I'd ever go back?!?

While that sounds like it would be the start of a middling review, it's actually why I like them so much. They have simply perfected the art of making a standard delicious burger. No hipster bragging about artisan, locally sourced ingredients here; the burger speaks for itself and doesn't need to make you feel good about where it came from because you'll be too busy enjoying your meal to care. French fries are perfectly prepared and I've received a more than adequate portion every time I've ordered them. My partner loves the Veggie burger, and while their Double Cheeseburger is their signature item, don't sleep on the Turkeyburger which I actually prefer. Customized burgers, fries and drinks for two + tip will easily approach $30, which may sound steep for a Food cart dinner, but Burger Stevens easily holds the honor of best burger I've ever had handed to me out of a window.

We are reviewing based on for categories: taste, coffee/ice ratio, atmosphere, and customer service.\\n\\nDiesel Cafe\\n***Cambridge (Iced) Coffee Crawl 2015 Winner***\\n\\nTaste: *****\\nWow. I expected great things knowing that they brew Intelligentsia Coffee, but these are some of the best iced drinks I've had. My honey latte was fantastic. Perfectly balanced coffee and honey flavors with an espresso that really complements the honey. The espresso has a sweet caramel and fruity palette that works really well for iced drinks. The star of the show, though, was the salted caramel latte. The homemade caramel sauce combined with that espresso is just about the perfect drink. Whoever came up with that recipe is a genius as it's just a perfect pairing. The saltiness and sweetness balance out, keeping the drink away from cloying and safely in the refreshing summer drink range. It's definitely a bit dessert-y, but not in a bad way by any means.\\n\\nCoffee/Ice Ratio: ****\\nThey make the drinks and mix them all separate from the ice, so you know your drink is going to be properly made every time. Enough ice to make it refreshing, but a little too much if you don't out-drink the melt.\\n\\nAtmosphere: *****\\nAgain, top marks here. There is tons of space, so even though it's crowded, it doesn't feel like it. There's a great vintage industrial feel to the inside, complete with a garage door that opens up the whole front of the shop to outside. My one small complaint is that they charge for WiFi. Since there is no signal here (at least for Verizon), that's annoying. You can connect via xfinity, though, so there's that option at least.\\n\\nCustomer Service: ****\\nThey were busy, but were still polite and didn't rush us at all. The barista was very professional and quick. The whole staff is very well dressed, polite, and makes great eye contact. I'm sure on less busy days, they'd be more talkative and engaging.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great spot with great coffee...

There are bottomless chips and salsa to start off, and multiple drink options. I ordered a steak chimichanga, and it was decent. However, the portion size wasn't particularly good, the flavor could be better (not much better than Tijuana flats' chimichangas) and I definitely would appreciate more guacamole and pico.

It was fresh, actual coconut and spices. Phenomenal!\\n\\nWe then moved on to some light food. For me that meant, the Pork Green Chili, the Queso, a Taco and the Avacado Salsa. The Avacado Salsa is made every time, super fresh and chunky!  It definitely caught my attention. The Queso was interesting, not your traditional take, it was mild but smokey. We found ourselves using our extra chip bits just trying to get the last little drops of that wonderful stuff!\\n\\nMy wife got the Chicken Enchilada plate. The salad/slaw was a bit too hot for her, she often tells me very mild salsa is too hot though. Even so it must have been good the way she finished it off! \\n\\nI got the Baja Style Crispy Kingfish with Kimchito. That's right, a south-of-the-border style Kimchi! Bam! Peppers in Kimchi!?

In summertime, the door-wall opens to the street, with plenty of outdoor seating as well.\\n\\nWhat's good?  Everything.   Their Normandy tart is a food group all of its own - the coffee is predictably excellent, served up in large bowl-sized cups.   Don't go here on some sort of gluten free/fat free/vegan existentialist diet - there's real cream for your coffee, and the pastries are flaky and drowning in butter.  Grab a bag (or three) of those little chouquettes near the register - heaven!\\n\\nIn one of the cases, you can take your pick of croque monsieur/croque madame; two types of quiche (Lorraine and Jardiniere), plus a whole lot of other goodies.

Also available are those delightful French baguette sandwiches if you're there around lunchtime (or want 'em to go).\\n\\nSome hints:\\n\\n1.  Get there early.   They open around seven, and the place is packed of a morning by eight (Lunch might be a similar experience, although I can't speak to that).\\n\\n2.  It's on the moderate side, price wise, so come expecting that.   Again - this isn't an American coffee shop.\\n\\n3.  Load up.

I struck out with my very first order - table wine or a house red please. None. That's ok.  We were seated and then as we started to discuss and point out to the server what we were leaning towards ordering the kitchen apparently ran out of those items. Well then what do you have left? We ordered the taglialini, opal rivers ravioli, lamb belly and a pizza. Overall, good but not great. Taglialini was a bit salty, lamb belly had too many thick sauces diluting the clean taste of the best in class stand alone meat. Pizza and ravioli were pretty average. The panna cotta was a terrible disappointment tasting more like a pudding. It missed the mark. Food carts & popular brunch spots rival the heart and soul put into the food. We were expecting that amazing artisan food experience that we had grown accustomed to in the food cart and mid level priced resto scene to be taken to a whole new level. Don't come here with high expectations based on the \\"best restaurant\\" review.  Renata needs some time to mature, to cultivate that authentic Portland food artisan passion that it lacks.

One server at 2pm trying to seat people, take orders and bting out food. Thats an ownership problem. While i dont blame the server ( Alicia) for this situation, she showed no sense or urgency, had an attitude, and didnt try to clear empty plates until i asked, despite walking past table numerous times. This is a competitve market in an off the beaten path location. This type of service or lack of it will spell doom.\\n\\nHummos was good but not great. Needed more lemon.\\n\\nHalloumi cheese appetizer was great but thought it was a misstep trying to make it in a caprese style. The cold tomato cools down and hardens the hot halloumi. Id re-think it Mr Hilal.\\n\\nPickled Plates of vegetables was the real deal reminiscent of what id eat at homes and restaurants in my travels to Arab World. \\n\\nFatoush was bland. Needs to be chopped more fine..needs more zaatir.....more sumac. Thicker pita chips tossed on top would be better.\\n\\nOur sandwiches were some of the best middle east style ones ive had in America. Loved how they were rolled tight and pressed on a panini grill. The pickles vegetables and garlic tahini sauce made them money. I thought they could have used more meat. \\n\\nTabouleh needed more more salt and olive oil. I added both and it was decent.\\n\\nBaklava was out of this world. Period. Wow.

Yet OC can be such a pain in the ass without even trying.

I eat out a lot and have traveled extensively, and nothing touches my heart like Sweet Cheeks.\\n\\nHaving eaten their entire menu on my dozen or more visits there, it's impossible for me to convey how truly phenomenal their food is. What follows is mostly praise; some loving criticism is at the bottom.\\n\\nFirst, they have the best biscuits on the planet. Their biscuits are massive, about 5 ounces each, and are served with house made honey butter. The biscuits are beautiful, pull apart bundles of warmth and joy. I served their biscuits at my Thanksgiving  dinner. These biscuits cannot be oversold. $10 for 4 or $3 each. Do not miss this. Leftover biscuits microwave well at 30 seconds wrapped in a damp paper towel. Do not refrigerate the whipped butter. This is for those occasions when you come alone and order biscuits to go...which I proudly do on the reg.\\n\\nTheir meat is Texas style barbecue, dry rub served with sauce on the side. Their ribs are fantastically meaty and fatty but not overly so. Their brisket is incredible as well, very tender and flavorful. Their buttermilk fried chicken is great but I'm a pork lover and rarely order it. The sausage, pulled chicken, burnt ends (lunch only) are all high quality. Their beef short rib (great northern), which comes on and off the menu, is the best single piece of meat I have ever eaten, including steak from Figuera Rubaiyat, the best steakhouse in Brazil. It is massive, tender, meaty, a little fatty, with a great crust and all served on a giant dinosaur bone.\\n\\nTheir side dishes are, incredibly, almost better than the meat. Notable standouts are the cheesy grits, better than you can find them anywhere; the broccoli casserole, which is cheesy and delicious; and the farm salad, which is beautifully balanced. Oh, and the carrot and raisin salad, when its on the menu, is probably my favorite salad. \\n\\nTheir hot and crispies are phenomenal, and I was floored to see the hush puppies taken off the menu, which I heard was for quality control. They were served with maple sour cream, and I often had them for desert. Please bring them back. The fried tomatoes, fried okra, and salt and pepper potatoes are all great. Normally, however, a biscuit is a better appetizer for me. \\n\\nDesserts: the giant nutter butter is much softer and better than original nutter butters, think a giant soft cookie peanut butter sandwich. I had it once and it feeds 4 easily. I do not let myself order it because shoot, it's gotta be 3000 calories. The shortcake is lemon curd, fresh cream and berries on their biscuit, and is one of the best desserts I could imagine.\\n\\nThe big rig, that thing in the corner that feeds 10? Order it. I did, for my birthday party, and it was a great decision.\\n\\nThey do amazing cocktails- my sister swears by the Hillbilly Hooch- but I tend to save room for food. Their soft drinks are served in big old mason jars and are both adorable and generously portioned.\\n\\nThe staff is attentive, friendly, and the place has a great atmosphere.\\n\\nAs I truly love this restaurant- and I mean that wholeheartedly, I eat here on any possible occasion - there are still a few things I would change. It would be nice to know which favorite menu items are on or off during a given season; perhaps a blog would work? It hurts coming to the restaurant hankering for the short rib to find it has once again gone into hiding. I'm not a huge fan of the wedge salad, but of course tastes vary and I respect the opinion of the chef.  The hush puppies need to come back promptly. Parking is nightmarish during Sox games, and the management is awesome for not allowing reservations for more than half the restaurant. However, it would be really meaningful if they could make some arrangement for customer parking during game time.  Also, the lack of cheesy grits at lunch is devastating.\\n\\nOverall, Sweet Cheeks embodies everything that makes me love dining out. The food is impeccable and satisfying and far exceeds the quality any amateur could really produce at home. The variety and experimentation of the menu make this a place worth visiting again and again. The thoughtfulness and quality put into all the food and service combine with the gastronomic excellence to make this more than just amazing food, but amazing dining."},{"name":"Maekha Thai","address":"163 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"We love Maekha Thai the food is always fresh and delicious.

Too thick and too less slices.  The original asian sauce on top?  this is not Japanese food ladies and gentlemen. \\n-  Fresh catch of the day: they said it was uni (sea urchin) and salmon. \\nI asked for uni in sashimi, but it was all brown and I couldn't believe the store present that crap to customers. \\nSalmon: boy, it did not taste fresh AT ALL. \\n- Waiting time: There were only four-five group of customers, 3 of which were couples and our waiting time for the sushi was 30-40 minutes. Unbelievable. \\n- Price: for the pitiful quality, it was close to 100 dollars.  Believe me, if you go to Oga's, SHIKI, even sushi express, you will be satisfied for what you get at 100 dollars. \\n- No chefs at the counter!! : For period of 10-15 minutes there were absolutely NO CHEFS at the counter seat, they left us two hanging for that period of time. Ladies and gentlemen, thats the last way to show appreciation to customers. \\n- There is a purpose for wearing hat: Yes, there is! To keep the hair from falling onto the sushi. This one guy with glasses, (Cory or Cary I forgot didn't have the hat on and was very rough handling the fishes. You have to take great care of fishes, if you declare to be a sushi chef and he had none. \\n- At the end of the course, I called the waitor and told him the reasons why I didn't leave tips, mainly mentioning the points above. This Cory person, came out of the blue and started yelling at a us (customer!) declaring not to say things to take his job away! Unbelievable! I was not saying things to take his position away, just saying to make the reputation better as a whole but the attitude just blew me away. \\nMy girlfriend asked do you have any respect for Japanese food, and he said \\"Then go somewhere else, but do not say things to take my job away!\\"  We became speechless... couldn't believe our eyes, our ears and we just left without any further remarks. \\n\\nThere are some other points that i would like to mention, but to sum up my points, the WORST experience ever and if you want to truly appreciate Japanese foods, do not go here.

It took a full 45 minutes before our apps were out (Edamame and Shishito Peppers) and another 30 minutes after that before the entrees arrived. The restaurant wasn't all that full, so it was especially weird. The drinks at least were reasonably speedy, at least after we flagged down the waitress a couple times to get them ordered. \\n\\nThe business of the 5% fee is just annoying. A perk of Portland is that you can figure out exactly what your bill will be ahead of time, no surprises, no tax calculations to make. \\n\\nThe fee tells me the owners probably don't pay their servers a living wage. The fact that they tried to blame it on not being eligible for the ACA was upsetting too; whether or not you like it, we don't have universal healthcare in the US. The fact that some people are able to qualify for help doesn't suddenly mean the burden to employers is gone. It was essentially a little note saying \\"We don't pay our servers well, and we tried to pin it on the government instead, but couldn't get away with it... so now it's your problem. Surprise!\\" \\n\\nIf you aren't making enough money to pay your servers either a) realize you're not running a solid business and move on to something else or b) raise the prices. Charge whatever you need to to run your business, instead of surreptitiously sneaking it in.\\n\\nSpecifically ask them to remove the fee. As an alternative, by all means, tip less, I just suspect that the owners don't *care* about that, and it just screws the employees.

However, to me, a restaurant experience is about service, ambiance and food. I found the service to be incredibly slow, while it was indeed during the lunch hour, the place was not busy at all. Therefore, I will not cut them any slack for the incredibly slow service. Upon walking in, not a word. No sign saying to wait for hostess or seat yourself. After a minute or so, someone was kind enough to say sit wherever you'd like. We took a seat outside.  We were one of two tables that had patrons. We waited several minutes for the waitress to come out. I asked for water and a margarita (Thursday special, don't judge me, it's always 5 o'clock somewhere!). My coworker had the pink lemonade which she said tasted more like flavored water. I didn't get my water and but she was 'kind enough' to give me a double margarita (without my asking, just realized after getting the check). The food was delivered after waiting an uncomfortable amount of time. I ordered mucho macho nachos with ground beef, and my coworker, the crab rolls. I requested a side of sour cream when I ordered, it didn't come out with the food, and still . . . No water. I asked for water and sour cream. Got the sour cream, no water.

If you enjoy high-quality, draft beer, this is the place for you. They have a fantastic selection, with many new brews (and nearly impossible to find elsewhere) rotated in and out of the tap list, a knowledgeable staff, plenty of room for groups, and a number of beer events (\\"meet the brewer,\\" tastings, beer releases, etc.). \\n\\nI found a number of reviews to be out-of-place, unrealistic, and frankly pretty ridiculous. I mean, you don't go to McDonald's for gourmet food, right? Not every place is for everybody. But are there not plenty of opportunities to determine whether a place is to your liking, before you even walk in and order something? This is the internet age, with loads of info at your disposal (establishment's website, user review sites like Yelp), and there's always word-of-mouth. Also, if you get to the point where you walk in and take a look around, and don't like what you see, then chances are it's not going to be the place for you an hour or so later. Nonetheless, we all have the luxury and right to opinion, which leads me to respond to the following complaints:\\n\\n- If there's nothing on their beer menu for you, then you probably aren't much of a beer drinker, and thus this place probably isn't for you\\n\\n- If you are \\"not a beer drinker,\\" this place definitely isn't for you\\n\\n- If you want to drink Mt. Dew, this probably isn't the place for you\\n\\n- If you don't like a beer hall-type atmosphere, then this probably isn't the place for you\\n\\n- If you think it's a hassle to get a beer poured by the actual brewer them-self, whom you could ask questions, then this definitely isn't the place for you\\n\\n- If you want cheap beer specials, then a place that has hard-to-find, high-quality DRAFT beers probably isn't the place for you\\n\\n- If you don't like converted warehouses (b/c that's what it was) to beer halls, this place is not for you\\n\\nIs this not Portland? I thought people knew better here. This place is what it is. It's a unique place, offering hard-to-find, craft brews (which come at a premium), in a relaxed, simple setting (yes a converted warehouse, but have you not noticed a theme in the neighborhood?). The bartenders have always answered any questions I had, and have recommended a number of great beers. I believe they are now owned by Rogue, and they also now brew their own beer.

Someone correct me, please if I am misinformed. The reason I point this out is that I have a higher opinion of the local merchants and food vendors than I do of the \\"antique/vintage\\" dealers.\\n\\nAlthough I still miss the old location, which apparently is no longer available, the outdoor market area here is sufficiently big enough to host a wide range of vendors selling hand-made items, jewelry, clothing, produce and baked goods, all-natural products, etc.  It's nice to browse on a sunny day and you can stop by one of the many food trucks there for something yummy to eat.  SoWa is (sadly and surprisingly) one of the few markets of its kind in Boston when compared with other cities, but I'm so thankful it is here and it's a great way to spend a lazy Sunday.  [Side note: I will say that the outdoor market seems to have fewer vendors and less variety than when it was in the previous location, although this could just be my own observation and not entirely accurate.  Feel free to post to the contrary if I am mistaken].\\n\\nThe antique/vintage market that is inside, however, is a different story.  And, although I was informed that these markets are separate, I am leaving my review here since they are a collective market for all intents and purposes, and there is nowhere to leave feedback for the antiques market.  Vendors here are ridiculously overpriced--the price-point for the antiques market has sky-rocketed and the overall range of vendors and merchandise has dwindled considerably from when it was housed down the street in the old open-air brick building.  Indoor space is at a premium and is cramped and crammed full of high(er)-priced items. Instead of being able to find a happy hodgepodge of inexpensive costume jewelry, re-purposed furniture, second-hand art and home decor, and more high-end items like mid-century modern furniture, you are now faced with a smaller number of vendors with overpriced \\"antiques\\" and vintage items.  Nothing here is affordable.  I am not sure if they have increased the price of their tables, thus eliminating those who command lower prices for merchandise, but they really need to get back the eclectic antiques market meets flea market vibe.  This new market is stuffy, not affordable and a major disappointment.\\n\\nOverall, both markets are a good way to spend a Sunday morning/afternoon even if you don't purchase anything, but I would still stick to the \\"Open Market\\" located outdoors if you have limited time or a leaner wallet.\\n\\nParking in the S End is fairly abundant for non-residents (and not metered), and although it's not very accessible via T, it's worth a little extra trek.

Not so at Vancouver airport: paucity of choices aside (alternatives literally included Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Burger King, and a dozen-seating bar offering ~2 types of sandwiches and unmemorable snacks), my co-traveler made the grave error of eating at Hanami Asian Cuisine, which should be rated a -1.\\n\\nGreasy, tasteless food aside, this Asian caf√© served mystery meat and managed to shock and gross out several random diners when a server accepted a mixed up order from a customer who had walked away--and dumped the contents into the main serving container. A few middle-aged ladies from separate traveling parties expressed their great dismay at shut-down worthy lapse in hygiene/cleanliness standards that went on in front of paying customers; one woman even asked for the manager's name, threatening to file a report to local food inspectors. Hearing this, I thanked my lucky stars for not ordering sushi. \\n\\nNot privy to this conversation, a family at the next table complained at getting a tiny serving of dumplings (I got only 3 as well) and the unpleasantness of the meal-to-cost ratio overall. Though with a continued feeling of hunger and barely halfway into the meal, I finished my beverage and walked away in dismay. For a city with so much incredible Asian cuisine, Hanami ears negative stars in my book.

Newbury street has a TON of choices for breakfast/brunch but I always loved the look of Stephi's and I mean come on.. it's ALWAYS packed so it's got to be good right?

The manager (or maybe it wasn't? definitely was a worker) said he needed to check in with the hostess.  Guess what buddy he tried to but she wasn't paying him or us any attention because she was on the phone.  So maybe she was working with a customer on the phone making a reservation, you should STILL ACKNOWLEDGE people in front of you.  So when she said nothing for a while (maybe she was on hold?) my mom asked very nicely \\"we'd like a table for two when you get a chance\\" but let's be honest that should have NEVER had happened.  I worked in food service, customer service, retail... you are supposed to acknowledge someone regardless of what you are doing.  A simple \\"I'll be right wtih you\\" is enough.  No, the hostess just said \\"give me a second OK?\\"  Too bad you can't share tone on Yelp. Seriously???? She put a 5min damper on what was supposed to be a nice breakfast with my Mom.\\n\\nI'll be honest, i was furious. no one talks to my mom like that.

The hostess gave us a little stare as we walked away and we went to Joe's across the street.\\n\\nI will be emailing the restaurant as well directly because poor service is unacceptable these days.

The City Landing burger is really friggin' good looking, but it's all beauty and no substance. All of the elements should have been there, and maybe, just maybe, a return visit would yield different results. I only say that because the burger fails largely due to a universal lack of seasoning, but that's a tough road to recover from. It's a $15 burger that of course sounds nice on paper (scallion-basil aioli, caramelized onions, sliced pickle, spiced fries) but that's where the excitement ends. \\n\\nThe well proportioned and properly cooked burger boasts a toasted yet soft Kaiser-type bun that is a great choice, holding in the patty like a glove. The fully melted cheddar is a highlight, offering a sharp tang that mostly dominates the flavor profile. The burger shows grill marks but has absolutely no crust, it's as if the marks are artificial and it was just steamed because there is no flavor development on the exterior of the patty. It's a very bland patty too, with a very minimal amount of juiciness and little else to speak of. The caramelized onions are watery and also lacking any punch or predominant flavor. The pickle is warm and completely bland as well, offering no acidity or crunch like a great pickle should have and the promised scallion-basil aioli is completely undetectable. The fries, however, are close to perfect despite not necessarily having much \\"spice\\" as promised on the menu. A lot of places try to mimic the famed McDonald's fries, and the one's here are as close to the golden arches as you're going to get. Thin, crispy and salty, they are unoriginal but delicious and there's nothing wrong with that in my book.\\n\\nSometimes one element of a burger may be off or simply be not my cup of tea. Unfortunately for the City Landing burger each element is severely under-seasoned with the beef being the primary disappointment. Is it a mundane blend or would a more generous sprinkling of salt fix the problem? Hard to say because the beef has little to no flavor and my guess is that's due to seasoning even if it may just be a standard blend of beef. It's clearly a showstopper of a burger, looking better than it is, a wise bun selection and delectable fries can't be the saving grace this time around.

The 4 huge biscuits in the bucket were great, not too dense, but the honey butter was the real star. \\n\\nAs for the entrees, we each got a 3 meat Fat Cheeks tray. I opted for brisket, ribs and pork belly with baked beans and slaw. The pork belly was great and I thought the brisket good, tender and flavorful. But, the ribs. Good God, I have no idea what they did in the kitchen but the ribs tasted chemically. I ate only one on the tray and I was done. No one at the table enjoyed the ribs at all, which is really unfortunate for a BBQ place. The sauces provided on the table were also underwhelming. \\n\\nWe traveled down here specifically from NH to visit this restaurant and after a hefty bill and having to pay for parking, I wouldn't do that again. If I was in the area, I would go here again and stick with the drinks, biscuits and the brisket. \\n\\nThe search for great BBQ in New England continues...."},{"name":"Bent's Cafe","address":"7 Pleasant St","city":"Milton","stars":"3.5","text":"Order: large iced coffee, sausage egg & cheese on a croissant. \\n\\nCoffee was good, breakfast sandwich was unreal, in and out in 5 minutes.

Some were senior citizens and some with slight dementia. Now I that separate checks can be a pain in the butt if a place is busy but this place was dead. After all they cater to an older crowd and i'm sure other groups of \\"older\\" folks come in and need separate checks like we did and they get the same lousy attitude and NEVER go back. Not everyone in out group needed their own check but a few did so why not do it? We got the same lousy service and attitude at Angelica's which I believe is the same owner? \\n  When I take this group for lunch every week we NEVER get such an attitude as we did at the Continental. I always inform the server at the time we are being seated that we will need a few separate bills and I am ALWAYS extra polite about it. The thing is the food wasn't too bad. Decent lunch price and portion sizes with great rolls and bean dip. \\n    We went to Polacari's last week which is right up the street and the waitress was so sweet and had no problem with a few separate bills.

I finally had to tilt the bowl and drain it out onto the plate to eat the last half. But it's not about the food here, though the cooks were working until almost midnight. It's about the beer lineup. And the beer lineup is awesome, given over almost wholly to Oregon stuff with a scattering of WA and CA beers, precious few from anywhere but the west coast. \\n\\nRandom amusement: the two broskis at the bar, loudly lamenting their romantic foibles.

This small incident has turned into a much bigger problem because of the way, not only the staff, but also the higher management has handled the event. \\n\\nWhile at dinner, one of the waiters knocked over our candle and spilled candle wax on my blouse.  Again, this was not a big deal.  Accidents happen. \\n\\nHowever, when I informed the waitress that there was also candle wax all over the table and on my phone/phone, she dismissed my concerns by saying \\"it's no big deal, you can just scratch it off your phone.\\"  \\n\\nIt was handled relatively okay at the restaurant - the manager apologized that the waiter had spilled wax (to which I graciously accepted and reiterated that accidents happen) and offered to compensate me for my dry cleaning bill if I brought it back to the restaurant; I assume this is pretty standard procedure.  \\n\\nI left a comment card noting what had happened so that if something like this occurred in the future they could perhaps handle it better (i.e. waitress showing more concern and overall the staff ensuring we had a pleasant experience). \\n\\nI would never be writing this review, had I not received the following email from the Director of Operations.  \\n\\nAs a final note, my party was there on a Monday when all patrons get a discounted rate for small plates and champagne.  My party ordered several small plates (in addition to entrees, desert, and coffee), which were given the same discount as all other patrons but no other discounts were received or offered, unlike the insinuation below. \\n\\n\\n\\"Harlan Scott harlan.scott@parksideprojects.com\\nOct 15 (1 day ago)\\n\\nto me \\nHi Ms. Cline,\\n \\nPaul informed me of your incident last night at Olive & June and I was hoping for some clarification on your comment card.  Paul most certainly offered to pay for the dry cleaning and handle any expenses associated with replacing the clothing if necessary.   Your comment card says the opposite, and that you were \\"insulted\\" and that you won't return as a result.  I'm trying to get a grasp on how Paul's handling of the situation was insulting so I can address this with all my staff if necessary.\\n \\nI've been in this business 15 year and I can't say that spilling of wine or something as benign as candlewax correlates to extensive compensation beyond what was offered, especially when your entire bill was half off to begin with.  This incident was the fault of our backwaiter at the very the end of the meal, though the server was punished for it, reflected by several of the tips.  Was the service subpar throughout the night?  In that case I'll say no more, and your feelings and comments are justified indeed.  Candle wax easily comes out with hot water, and Paul told me everyone in your group was extremely relaxed and overly nice about the whole thing and insisted he not do more.  Perhaps he misread the situation?   Your bill already had a $60 discount for mezzo Monday, so I'm asking what more \\"compensation\\" you would have liked for candle wax on your clothing.

The waiter stopped by to inform the BF that his dinner was coming 'right out,' but it was at least another 10 minutes until it arrived.  He was growing increasingly impatient and thought the waiter forgot his order.  \\n\\nFOOD:  My friend complained that her fried rice \\"used to be better,\\" but seemed to enjoy the tempura veggies.  The BF seemed happy with his food once it arrived.  For cheap sushi, the Nigiri was pretty good.  Not artfully made, but edible.  The cheap maki rolls (spicy tuna, rock & roll, crispy calamari) were a bit of a mess and fell apart when eating.  If I returned, I would stick with nigiri and perhaps get one of the more expensive 'specialty rolls.'

As a big fan of Southern-style BBQ, I was looking forward to having some authentic barbecue that I have not yet been able to experience in New England. The buzz surrounding Sweet Cheeks was all very upbeat, so I was excited to visit the restaurant as soon as it opened. \\n\\nThe Food: A restaurant is only as good as its food, so I'd like to review that first. I started with an appetizer of hushpuppies and then I had the \\"Big Cheeks\\" tray which comes with three meats, a hot side, and a cold side, as well as two slices of bread for my entree. Well, the hushpuppies weren't my favorite. They were under-fried and were missing a lot of spices. Perhaps the chef was trying to create a more gourmet hushpuppy, but these were a bit too bland for my palate. \\n\\nThe entree that I had was delicious. Everything that I had - the pork belly, the pulled chicken, and the brisket - was incredible BUT I felt extremely cheated when I received my plate. I paid $28 for my meal, which I would have happily paid for a fair portion, but instead of adding food to the \\"tray,\\" they merely substituted food. In other words, if I were a bit more decisive, I could have paid $18 for an identical portion size of just pork belly or any of the other meats on my plate. To me, adding $10 to the cost of my meal should give me more than just variety, it should mean more food. The single piece of pork belly that I got, and the single piece of brisket, were not even the size of a credit card. The other person that I was eating with and I joked that this was \\"diet BBQ\\" because we both left the restaurant hungry. In fact, this value issue is the only reason that I won't be going back really soon. I wasn't alone in sharing this sentiment - I heard several people grumbling about the portion sizes throughout my meal.\\n\\nThe Service: The service was really slow - so slow that they refunded those hushpuppies - but I'm not including that in my consideration of my rating because it was their first weekend in operation and I know that can be tough. Our waitress was really nice and seemed genuinely sorry that things were moving slowly.\\n\\nThe Ambiance: This is a winner. The restaurant's design is inviting and comforting while simultaneously being elegant. I enjoyed looking around during the meal and taking in the details.\\n\\nIf Sweet Cheeks can add more value to it's offerings - either by significantly lowering its prices or, more importantly, increasing portion sizes, this place can be a real winner because the food is at the quality that it should be. I just didn't appreciate that both people in my party left hungry."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I love Stephanie's on Newbury - the food is always good, and the location is hard to beat.

The brisket was well done except for the giant fatty chunks which turned my stomach a bit. Maybe that's how they meant it to be? I had to cut those pieces off to even start to take any bites. The BBQ sauce at the table definitely moistened the meat and gave it some more flavor. I could taste a ton of smokiness in the meat! The black eyed peas were really gross. I took one bite and didn't eat the rest. I think they should be replaced by Texas Caviar!! Much better choice in my opinion. The farmer's salad was good. I also had a bite of my friend's mac n cheese. Overall it was not too mushy and cheesy enough- probably could have used some salt. LOVED the biscuits. They were, by far, the best part of the meal.

If I were rating it on food alone, I would definitely give it at least 4-4.5 stars, but the service was so horrendous this past time that I can't bring myself to give it more than two.\\n\\nIt started out innocently enough, with a group of 8 of us deciding to go there on a Saturday night to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Maybe my bad experience had to do with the fact that we had a party of 8 (gasp!) tried to go on a Saturday night (god forbid) or that we were celebrating a birthday and had a bit of a time schedule that night (can you imagine?).  \\n\\nIn either case, knowing how busy it does get on the weekend, we decided to make a reservation earlier in the week.  We tried making it for 8:00, but they were only able to accommodate a group of our size at 7:30.  No big deal, so we shifted around our plans for later in the evening to account for this earlier time.  The 8 of us got there at precisely 7:29, and were told that our table would be ready shortly.  Fast forward 20 min...40 min...50 min.  Actually, I wish I could have fast forwarded that quickly.  Instead, because the bar area was totally packed, our group of 8 was stuck standing there for close to an hour waiting for our table, half-way between the bar and the doorway, awkwardly standing RIGHT next to tables of people who, in turn, were awkwardly trying to enjoy their dinner and pretend like we weren't there.  My 6'4\\", 220 pound friend even had to go stand outside for the last 20 minutes, as he was feeling so claustrophobic at that point he though he was going to have an anxiety attack.  Finally at about 8:25 our table was ready.  Whew, what a relief.  Now we can finally relax and enjoy the evening, right? Nope, not so fast.  \\n\\nOver the next hour or so, we were brought plates of wrong food (No, no one here likes goat cheese.  We're sorry, but we really did not order that), had sangria spilled on the table by our waitress, without a clean-up or apology, even after it spilled over on to my friend's lap, and had our friend's birthday dessert completely forgotten about, after I tried to stealthily remind the hostess after we got there.  The last straw though was when we got our bill and they had overcharged us by close to $60.  While they did quickly fix that error, we asked the bill to be split on two cards.  I understand it must be annoying when people all have cards and try to split it by 8 or 10 or 11 and a half, so we though we were being pretty reasonable by just doing it evenly between two.  This proved to be too much though, and we realized after the cards were ran that the check had been split - but both charges were put on one of the cards.  After all this, we were afraid of what would happen if were asked them to cancel it and re-do it the way we asked (and now running almost an hour behind schedule), our kind friend decided to leave it all on her card and have us square up with her later.\\n\\nNow we are all reasonable people, and, having worked in the food service industry for 4 years myself I understand a busy night, and I know the work can be unpleasant and unrewarding.  I will also point out that we still left a very generous tip, as we know this was not the sole fault of our server.  But the combination of all of these things and the stress of it when we were trying to have an upbeat celebration was just unacceptable. I still love the food and I had been dying to take my family there, but have changed my mind as I would frankly be embarrassed to have them come into the city and have an experience like that.  I think it will be awhile before I patronize Tasca again, and will probably limit my next visit to 5:00pm on a weeknight."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"you never disappoint me yuzu. \\n\\nwe walked in on a monday night thinking at least a 30min wait but we got lucky and got the last 2 seats at the bar!  #win!! \\n\\ngosh. how can you be so fresh and delicious with every dish?  their ramen was def on point last night though.  eventho i was stuffed with the 5 other dishes we killed prior,  my spoon did not wanna be put down. \\n\\njust simply two thumbs up."},{"name":"Danketsu","address":"11425 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The serves was great.

I had high hopes, as the is (was) one of my favourite sushi places in Orlando. I used to eat here every Thursday night with friends and never had a bad experience, although it had been a while since my last visit.\\n\\nOnce we checked in for our 7:15 reservation and were sat, it took around 10-15 minutes for the waiter to come for our drink order. The restaurant was fairly busy, but certainly not packed. I was beginning to think we didn't have a server assigned to our table. In fact, the only reason we got our appetizer order placed in any sort of timely manner is because I misheard him when he asked for the drink order. \\n\\nWhen our appetizer finally arrived (we got the pumpkin lover appetizer, described as tempura shrimp stuffed with pumpkin), I bit in only to realize it was actually just a ball of fried dough. There was something white and shriveled inside, which I am hoping was not the shrimp, and not a spot of pumpkin. We opened all four of them in hopes the first one was a fluke but no such luck. We were there probably between 30-45 minutes before he came back for our entree order, which didn't arrive for almost another hour. We ordered four pretty basic/standard rolls. By the time we received our food, we had been there for an hour and a half. The couple at the table next to us ordered several rolls separately, all of which came and were eaten before we were even served (this was the scenario with several other tables around us). I don't know if the other folks had reservations or not but certainly ours was not very helpful. The waiter never came by even once to let us know how much longer the wait would be. Even when he cleared our appetizer dishes 30+ minutes after it arrived, he didn't say a word. The one redeeming quality is that the sushi was decent, although it was very salty. \\n\\nI asked the waiter to take the appetizer off the bill due to our disappointment with what we got verses what had been described, plus the hour and a half wait. He applied the Living Social coupon and came back with another bill for almost $8.00 for automatic gratuity! There were only two of us so there was not a large party, NOR was I given any sort of indication that gratuity would be added. It was not even on my original bill. So, I was forced to leave a tip amount that I did not calculate based on the service or experience and was not made aware would be automatically added.\\n\\nI don't know that I will ever go back to Nagoya Sushi.

Texas Roadhouse was like that. It's yet another chain steak place, but something was missing.\\n\\nThe peanut shells on the floor give a certain lived-in welcome feel to the place. The staff is friendly and the meat counter where you can pick out your exact but of meat is a nice touch, but when the rubber hits the...errr.. when the meat hits the grill things aren't exactly great.\\n\\nFor starters getting the cut I wanted turned out to be a challenge. I don't need a heaping slab of meat so I usually opt for the smallest Prime Rib cut offered. Unfortunately that wasn't available  for my preferred medium rare so I had to trade up to a larger cut. Not that big of an issue - there's always lunch or diner the next day. But when the larger cut come out medium to medium well, and i was told there was no medium rare available, things went off the tracks.\\n\\nThe entire point of ordering the larger, more expensive cut was to get it prepared the way I wanted.  So sending it back, and now being told to forget getting a Prime Rib, I opted for a RIbeye, medium rare, smaller cut.  Annnnd... no small cuts.\\n\\nAt least this time around I did manage to get the larger sized cut prepared medium rare, but the flavor was lacking. I won't say bland, but as close as you can get without actually being bland.\\n\\nThe server left the au jus from the prime rib so I figured it could help out the rib eye. No such luck. The Au Jus tasted more like an seriously watered down bullion cube than the rich meaty juice I expected. \\n\\nBy the time the meal was over, the only stand out praise I could give was for our server's repeated apologizes and honest attempts (and I suspect honest feeling of helplessness to improve our experience) to make things right and the frankly amazing bread that came with the meal.\\n\\nWhile I certainly didn't expect much after that experience, the manager did discount our check by to reflect the cost of the smaller cut of rib eye than the larger I was served, but ultimately when you get a discount on a meal you didn't want that wasn't very good it doesn't really do much to improve the experience.\\n\\nI may go back one day, but as long as Longhorn Steak house is closer with much better food and almost never out of Prime RIb, I can't say it will be any time soon."},{"name":"El Arroyo 5th Street","address":"1624 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I work in the building opposite El Arroyo and can I say that it is awesome to be so close to them.

I will admit, it was a BUCKEYE game day, so maybe that was a mitigating factor.  But, still......weird the few people there. I was with a group.  Our server was really patient and nice. He was also as helpful as he could be given the circumstances. First off, several listed menu items were not available this particular evening. When ordering the Copious Burger, I was told I couldn't order a specific temperature, because of the \\"thinness\\" of the burger it only came \\"medium\\". Literally, HIS words, not mine. But then a few minutes later, it didn't matter because he returned saying they didn't have BURGERS that evening. What?? Really?? A burger??? okay then.... Next. Ordered the Walleye entree only to find out they didn't have Walleye but were substituting Cod instead.Cod?? You can get at any fast casual place? Saying the preparation was the same doesn't make it better. On a positive note, several in our group enjoyed their meals without any complaints. Seemingly, the short rib dish, is their signature and most popular. As I remembered, this dish was originally served with something other than the forgettable mac&cheese. Admittedly, my memory isn't that good. Anyway, I thought this time that the meat was beef roast as opposed to a short rib. Now I do know the difference between the two. Plenty of wine, makes it all seem so inconsequential. Wait, a minute. The dessert.  When it came time to order I jokingly, okay maybe a little sarcastically, said what don't you have? Turns out, it was the chocolate mousse cake,which several in our group wanted.  We ended up with two desserts that didn't measure up with the thoughts of the chocolate mousse.  \\nAfter the disappointment with the meal, we went downstairs to \\"shake it off\\".  The band was really THAT GOOD.  We had so much fun dancing, and some in our party, went to a side room to cool off & watch TV.  It was a win, win.  What was not a win, the slippery, sticky floor from all those spilled drinks.  Even before the ones we spilled.  At one point, I literally slipped off my wooden chair on to that floor.

Seriously, look to your right and there's a whole periodic table of cheeses. It poked at my curiosity, because I thought grilled cheese is just all American or Swiss cheese, but NOOOOOOO.. Toasted serves all types of different cheeses. \\n\\nI ordered \\"As Gouda As It Gets\\" and this was very different for me, because it had chicken and an Italian feel. As I ordered this, I realized that with all of the cheese, I was trying to be \\"healthy\\". So if you're stuck between having a cheat day or being healthy, I think this is a great option for you. It has gouda cheese, chicken, garlic spinach and it matched the dipping tomato soup beautifully. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the Braised Brisket grilled cheese sandwich (at this point, for me I threw away my so-called diet) and I really really really loved this sandwich. All of the bread was butter-toasted to perfection. The brisket has a great BBQ sauce that came with the sandwich. The bbq was sweet and tangy, very different from many bbq sauces that I had the pleasure of tasting. The meat was pulled and was tender. This sandwich was also served with -- let me pause for a second--- SWEET TEA CARAMELIZED ONIONS. Oh my goodness, this sandwich was just absolute perfection especially with the fontina cheese oozing out with every bite (I suggest to not use the tomato soup with this sandwich). \\n\\nMy brother and his girlfriend ordered some AWESOME burgers, the Southern comfort (Mac & Cheese in a burger sayyy whaaaaat?!) and Holy Basil (Pesto burger done right). I was fortunate enough to have a bite of the Southern Comfort and I guess it's also my favorite because of that amazing BBQ sauce, bacon and mac&cheese. Toasted also has some pretty amazing truffle fries too. \\n\\nI'm definitely blown-away by this place. It really brought me back to my middle-school days when all I wanted was my grilled cheese and tomato soup.

My boyfriend got the pulled pork, which I found to be decent but nothing special, and I got the pork belly, which was like giant slabs of bacon with extra fat. It was awesome, but hard to stomach because it was so rich, even though I got the smallest portion. Thankfully I ordered the farm salad as well. At that point anything green tasted like heaven, and I wanted to go swimming in it. I couldn't take more than a few bites, though, because I was so full from the biscuit and belly.\\n\\nThe waiter was amazing, by the way.

I like to order a ragu dish to compare classic Italian restaurants, and this one really was quite tasty, The wine by the glass came in great big glasses.

It was succulent, perfectly seasoned (read: not salty), and filled me up really quickly. 3) The sides were delicious, especially the cole slaw. It was freshly made and the cabbage was still crisp; soggy cole slaw is the worst for me. 4) Good service and the restaurant itself was really cute, clean, and welcoming.\\n\\nCons: 1) Don't get me wrong- the pork belly was amazing, but I reached food coma levels very quickly because it was quite fatty. This is not really a complaint since it's pork belly and should be fatty, but in the middle of the meal I was really feeling overwhelmed by how tasty and fatty it was. Don't order the pork belly if you're looking for a relatively lighter meat option.\\n\\nSummary: When I am back in Boston again, you will find me there.

The scallops were the best as they had fresh sweet briney taste to it (I'm drooling just thinking about it) and my second best was a tie between the sweet shrimp (which comes with crispy deep fried shrimp head - yum!) and the uni. Also worth mentioning is their unagi sushi as they were juicy and there was definitely more eel than there was rice (most sushi places can't get this one right either the eel is small/skinny, dry or a combination of both) I highly recommend for eel lovers. I was so satisfied with the quality of their sushi that I had to place a second order and I left with a happy full belly.

The vinegar sauce was to-die-for, legit wanted to stuff it in my bag.\\n\\nPork Ribs- Literally fell off the bone so I ate them with my fingers. Such good flavor I didnt even need sauce with it.

I felt weird hovering behind someone sitting trying to enjoy their meal, but this place is so tiny that it's hard to not be in the way.

We ordered the Baba Ghanoug for appetizers and were very impressed. It was very similar to what it tastes like in the Middle East (area, not the restaurant across the street..). I had the tuna melt which comes with homefries. The homefries are NOT fried, and are actually boiled with other veggies.

There were only few customers inside. We ordered our ramen and have been waiting for 35 mins before the food arrives. I wondered why our ramen took so long to cook. I ordered miso ramen. I started eating my noodle and found something in my mouth is really tough and chewy. I split it out and realized it's actually an elastic band instead of the noodle. The color of the elastic band looks exactly like the noodle, so i wasn't careful enough and put it in my mouth. I told the waitress and she was nice enough to change the ramen for me, but my appetite was already ruined. When the new ramen arrived, I quickly ate a little bit and paid the bill and left. The dining experience was definitely not good due to the long waiting time for the food and found something not supposed to be in the soup. we will not return again."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great place...

T\\n\\nTOP: Gumbo espa√±ola, Asado de cerdo (this char grilled pork dish is really tied together by the sweet chili jam - not just top, but a must-try!), Albondigas (delicious & cheesy yum!), \\n\\nBOTTOM: Los tres amigos, Confit de pato (had high hopes for this duck, but it just wasn't a tender/fall-off-the bone)\\n\\nMIDDLE - aka we were both getting pretty fully so I ate one of the tapas and The Boy had the other - not an overwhelming consensus on either: Costillas de ternera (horseradish cr√®me fra√Æche & root veggies really complemented the short rib - ended up taking this home and was able to enjoy it in its full the next day), Croquetas de pollo - The Boy really enjoyed these.\\n\\nSide of green beens was necessary to supplement our meat-heavy dinner. The green beans actually came out first so it wasn't really much of a side though. We finished it before our first round of tapas arrived.\\n\\nDessert is BOMBBBBB at Tasca. The Boy and I really shouldn't have after essentially 7 courses but we were glad we did! Crepe Helado is among the best dessert I have EVER EATEN. I did not expect it to come out in the form it did but the portion was GIANT but even The Boy thought the dessert was amazing. Wheels of cookie ice cream with a thin crepe wrap around the outside smothered in chocolate and amaretto sauce is BOMB. Their Flan is pretty good too.\\n\\nThough they have a nice variety of tapas that do differ from the other tapas restaurants found throughout Boston, the service here though friendly can be iffy. The Boy would've had 3-4 beers throughout this meal but only had 2 because of slow service. The later in the night it got and as more of our tapas were served, the less we saw our waitress. We were turning our heads left and right for about 10 minutes at the end of our meal looking to get the check and leftovers wrapped up.\\n\\nRounding up for the stars but overall Tasca gets a 3.5/5 for me slipping due to inconsistency between tapas and how badly service seemed to slip as the night went on.

It was definitely a huge culture shock at the time and while I love being a Canadian citizen and enjoying the benefits of a peaceful and violence-free life, there are a lot of things I still miss about Mexico.  The main three things I crave are the warmth of the people, the amazing weather, and the outstanding food. \\n\\nMexico has one of the richest and most extensive food cultures in the world. Our lives revolve around eating with our friends and relatives and spending hours discussing controversial topics and laughing and singing over a meal. Some of the best food I have ever eaten was made in Mexico and that's mostly because people there are proud to spend two days in the kitchen to prepare something for you - it's the way they show their love. \\n\\nDue to my adoration of Mexican food, I'm always on the hunt for high-quality Mexican spots in Vancouver. Tacos are my weakness and even though I have been to the highly praised La Taqueria and really enjoyed it, I was also happy to discover El Centro while walking around downtown Vancouver a couple of weeks ago. El Centro is a small and quaint restaurant with a nice patio facing the highly fashionable and trendy street of Robson. The staff are extremely friendly and the main waiter is as yummy-looking as the food itself - you'll see! \\n\\nThe food and drinks are well-priced and delicious. When I visit El Centro I just tend to get one order of each taco variety - chicken, al pastor, beef asada, and cochinita. The flavours of the tacos are rich and authentic just like in Mexico. Each taco order is served with two fresh tortillas so that you get two tacos for each kind of filling - a great deal for $2.50 each! The famous Don Guacamoles would charge you an arm and a leg for similar portions - I have nothing against their food but their prices are simply ridiculous.  I have had also ordered the pork torta at El Centro and even though it was good I would probably recommend to go to Las Tortas instead if you are craving authentic Mexican torta subs.\\n\\nOverall due to El Centro's food, location, service & music I would highly recommend giving it a try next time you are looking for a nice Mexican meal downtown."},{"name":"Motomachi Shokudo","address":"740 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I had the extra BBQ pork shio ramen.

Although I had eaten at the Far West location in the past and had attended a UT football watch party at this location, I still spent some time on their website going over the online menu. BTW, make sure to turn your computer's speakers OFF or WAY DOWN before you visit the site as there is some pretty obnoxious music that greets you as soon as you hit \\"enter\\" on your keyboard, lol! It takes a few seconds to find the \\"mute\\" icon! \\n\\nWhat I did not find on their menu or through a Google search was whether or not they had a lunch menu. Upon arriving at the restaurant and being seated in the very cramped and noisy indoor dining area (they were limiting seating outdoors due to the heat), I confirmed much to my disappointment that they do not feature a lunch menu of any kind. Sure, I can pack away a full-size dinner portion of good Tex-Mex any day, but I know that doing so at the lunch hour on a work day means I am completely unproductive and sleepy for the next 4-5 hours. I highly recommend that El Arroyo consider pursuing a condensed lunch menu featuring their most popular dishes in smaller portions, perhaps even combining iced tea into the selections (much like El Mercado). \\n\\nNonetheless, I selected the popular and signature BBQ chicken enchiladas while my co-worker went for seafood and ordered the \\"Heavenly Shrimp\\". Although I did not sample his plate, he thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp which was complemented by a nice steamed vegetable medley of squash, broccoli, zucchini. My enchiladas were presented nicely with a side of beans (your choice of refried, black, or pinto) and Mexican rice. The chicken was unspectacular and somewhat inconsistent in texture from stringy to a bit tough. The complimentary chips are thin, warm and crisp while the salsa is thin and runny. \\n\\nI was left with an overall \\"middle of the road\\" impression of the meal, despite being seated, served, and checked on promptly and efficiently. Much like other reviews of this location, I find myself not \\"wowed\\" or impressed by El Arroyo but also not opposed to returning for drinks and appetizers with a group during happy hour or for another UT football watch party."},{"name":"Goldbergs Fine Foods - Toco Hills","address":"3003 N Druid Hills Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great bagels, great service by Kristen!

I have used Yelp for many years. Mostly when I am out of town or in a different city but I need to post a review. I've never felt a need prior. I'm in town on vacation and Yelp is what brought me to Kobe. Japanese Hibachi is one of our favorite meals to do but if I'm ever back in Orlando I won't be back. \\n\\nFirst, you can't customize your meal if you're at a hibachi table? We don't like all vegetables. Only wanted onions and broccoli. Our waitress said I would only get like two pieces of broccoli if did that. What? Guess I'm spoiled by our restaurants back home. We have several and this has never been an issue. Opted with all the vegetables because apparently this was going to be a struggle. I ended up with one piece of broccoli. Should have taken the two. Needless to say we ended up with a pile of unwanted vegetables on our table that we picked out. Zucchini, green beans, and carrots that none of us wanted. \\n\\nSecond our drink glasses stayed empty way too much. If my drink runs out I stop eating.  One of my biggest pet peeves. \\n\\nThird and my biggest issue was our chef. I'm not going to name him but he was awful. You go for the show right? Well there wasn't one. He tried flipping the utensils and kept dropping them. He tried the \\"egg roll\\" trick and kept dropping them. He was making jokes and did the fire but that's about it. I was more entertained by the chef at the table behind us. He also was terrible with the portions distributed. Or it could have been on purpose. I hope not because it seemed sexist. He would always end up with food left after giving it out and the extra always went to the men at the table. There were 3 couples at the table and my party of 3 was me, my grown daughter, and a minor. When all the food was done here I was beside this guy whose plate was stacked with everything. Not only was mine short of the things i ate but could you have at least threw a little something extra my way seeing we had stacked all the vegetables off and our plates were short from that. I was trying not to feel this way but the kicker for me was when there was teriyaki chicken left after distribution and he gave the extra to a guy that didn't even order teriyaki chicken like we did. He ordered regular hibachi chicken. At that point I was done.  This guy kept putting food on the ladies plate that was with him that's how much extra the guys had. My plus one was another female so we didn't have that option. I spent more money and ended up with less food on 3 plates than all the other couples with only two people. I spent a lot of money and would have liked an even share of food. And I also noticed while watching the chef's show behind us that he didn't have leftovers to keep giving. His distribution was equally spot on almost every time. \\n\\nThis was just my personal experience with that chef. I'm not saying not to go. Just hope if you're a female you don't get that chef. Guess I would need to go with a table full of females for it to be even. \\n\\nKobe you need to make sure all your chefs distribute food equally so everyone can get the most for their money. \\n\\nI should be sleep but couldn't.

Out of the only two All You Can Eat KBBQ places in orlando (Izziban and this), I would say this is a better one in terms of meat quality and marination flavor. Unlike Izziban, you do not receive sushi or the few appetizers that come with the AYCE KBBQ choice which to some will be a deal breaker. But personally, I would forgo that for good meat. The spicy chicken was marinated well and did not taste like just sriracha sauce and chicken. The bulgogi was also marinated well with a slight sweet flavor to it and was not overpowered with sauce (they give you kbbq sauce on the side if you like your meats saucy - it tasted like ketchup + bbq sauce though, just saying). \\nI only tried the bulgogi, chicken, and marinated short ribs as those three are my favorites and ones I'm sure won't taste too bad. I cannot comment on the others. The bulgogi meat was red which made it seem like it's not marinated at all, however, when cooked you will realize it is marinated just right. \\nRelative to other kbbq places in the country such as New York, Toronto, and California, this was definitely below average.

The mussels are in a white wine sauce but, I wish they would add some garlic to it for that little extra it needs!  I do appreciate they use Prince Edward Island mussels because I think they have the best flavor.  The Ravioli is enough to share between two people because they serve it in two stoneware dishes with 4 ravioli in each and they are small by any means.

The atmosphere...an easy five stars. The 3 tiered indoor space is fantastic and the outdoor space, with its massive night lit grand old oak tree is stunning. The service is excellent, and the employees don't wear standard uniforms, in fact they all individually dress themselves in a very classy manner. They're also well trained, friendly and enhance the dining experience. \\n\\nThe food is a neat combo of farm to table meets southern Italian. The happy hour with the 1/2 priced apps and drinks (the bartenders are top notch) is one of my favorites in town. The only reason I didn't give Olive and June 5 stars is because the food is just a little rich for my tastes...which is definitely a personal preference.

I had dreams of visitng Japan in order to partake is this amazing looking Japanese dish.  This was almost 6 years ago when I was living in Eugene, OR where nothing even close to authentic Japanese ramen existed (sorry, not even Toshi's).  I'm now living in the great culinary hotbed of Portland, OR and with so many options I have to admit it now takes a lot to impress me.  It already takes a lot to impress a middle-aged Japanese-American who has been spoiled by family and family friends who know how to cook homestyle Japanese food.  It's been part of my life since I was born.\\n\\nI have passed by this restaurant on numerous occasions and it was mostly just the trendy Asian bar by Voodoo Donuts.  The interior is clean and sterile like most modern trendy bars.  The menu has a minimalist design and the first thing that jumps off the two sided paper is the price.  That being said, most restaurants in the Portland area are pricey.  \\n\\nI ordered the Pork Tsukemen.  The portion size was average but the flavor was ridiculously insane.  The pork was perfectly marinated and tender.  The pork fat soaked up the marinade and melted in my mouth.  The broth was not overpowering like I'd expect from a dipping sauce.  Most Asian restaurants tend to make their sauce with too much sugar, Afuri's sauce is the perfect balance that you would expect from umami flavor.\\n\\nI didn't try the dumplings as I was too excited to try the Tsukemen, but they are definite try on my next visit soon."},{"name":"Flyers Wings & Grill","address":"5621 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"These really are the real deal wings.

So I'm definitely confused as to how staff can confirm 5-5:15pm reservations and not serve us whatsoever until after 5:30.  \\n\\nWe decided to kill time at The Keg down the street, which led to spending more money than we wanted to.  I was very close to changing my mind about our reservation and doing The Keg's Dine Out which is guaranteed to be awesome.\\n\\nSo we returned for dinner and ordered.  The calamari was very tender and delicious, although far too salty.  The lamb shank comes with a red wine reduction.  The sauce did not resemble this whatsoever.  The spices and herbs were more moroccan style.  The lamb was also much fattier than I've experienced at other above-average restaurants; also too salty.  There were a few brussel sprouts and potato wedges included, which were very yummy.  Dessert was mini-lemon tarts with raspberry coulis.  A nice refresher and it satisfied me after a heavily flavored dinner.\\n\\nThe service was very attentive and friendly.  Atmosphere was clean and quaint but standard.  This was a nice place to try but I didn't think it was worth a $38 Dine Out.  Similarly, I could have gotten better quality and quantity at Mythos in North Van for $30.

Saying which is my favorite would be like having to choose which child is my favorite. They're all excellent in their own ways. Some are mild, others are a little spicy, while others pack quite a bit of heat. On top of the meaty guisados, the store also carries the best carnitas in town and has a chase of chicaron that you can get by the pound to go. On the last visit, my buddy got the chili relleno and it was easily the best chili relleno I've ever had.  Another friend got the cactus salad as a side and I was blind sided. I never knew a cactus salad could be so delicious. A third person got the whole fried fish. This one was just ok.

I feel compelled to write a review after our wonderful experience and reading through some of the 1-2 star reviews.\\n\\nWe made a reservation for 6:15PM and arrived early at 5:45PM. The hostess informed us that our table was not ready, but she could try and have it ready by 6:00PM. I had no expectations of them seating us when we got there, and figured we'd sit at the bar for drinks before getting our table at our reservation time of 6:15PM (they were pretty busy). It just happened to be happy hour till 6:30PM, of which all drinks and appetizers on the menu are half off; pretty good bargain! Our bartender recommended the Basil & Sun to my wife (their version of a mojito) and I had The Foreigner (Hendrick's gin, cucumber water, lemon), both were great and at a great price for happy hour! We were thinking about appetizers and were recommended the grilled quail by a party next to us. After finishing 1 drink, we were about to order an appetizer when the hostess came up and informed us that our table was ready. She politely waited until we closed out our tab and showed us to our table on the 2nd floor. I have to say that I was impressed with the ambiance in the restaurant, very comfortable, noise level was a bit elevated (people were obviously enjoying their evening), but not too high.\\n\\nAs we were seated at our table, our waiter was prompt to bring us menus and get our second drink order. I was about to order their Bloody Mary, however, our waiter informed me that it was not an ordinary recipe and that some may not like it. He recommended the Bella Milano (zucca, cocchi, st. elder elderflower liqueur, lime) instead; I have to say it was an excellent recommendation! We also ordered the Grilled Quail appetizer (pomegranate, espresso, pine nuts, pickled butternut squash, fig vinaigrette), since it was half off for happy hour, which my wife and I thought was excellent. Sure it was a small portion for a fairly high normal price, but for happy hour, we thought it was definitely worth it. For dinner my wife had the Gemelli with pork sausage,white wine, arugula, garlic, fennel. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the flavors were delicious; if we had one complaint, it would be that it was a bit salty. I had the Braised Rabbit (with pancetta,patty pan squash,cipollini onion, pistachio salsa verde), as I've never tried rabbit before and I've been itching to try it. It was absolutely fantastic! Extremely tender, not a hint of gaminess (which I had expected), and layers of flavor! We also had an order of Roasted Brussels Sprouts with oregano, paprika almonds and shaved pecorino romano which was a pleasant addition. We ended the night with a gelato trio (roasted banana, mint something or other, and don't remember the third). \\n\\nAll in all, we thought the food was great and definitely worth the asking price (yes, it is a fairly pricey restaurant). During our entire meal, if the waiter wasn't checking up on us, his assistant was constantly filling up our empty water glasses and attending to our needs. Not once did I feel like the service was subpar, and no one acted snobby. We will definitely be visiting again the next time we're in Austin."},{"name":"Power House Cafe","address":"111 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely love this place!

I also added a glass of their House-made Tanzanian Chocolate Milk ($4). Seriously... if you try anything in this restaurant, you've got to try this out.\\n\\nThe chocolate milk is frothy and not overly bitter but you can definitely taste the flavour of the melted chocolate in the glass.\\n\\nThe tender pork belly paired well with the coffee-crusted bark. Contrary to what you might think, there wasn't an overt coffee flavour to the crust (which suited my preferences).\\n\\nThe potatoes were okay but lacked a crispy exterior. The biggest issue I had with this dish was that I found a bit of eggshell in my eggs.\\n\\nI brought my sweetie here for a revisit the following week. However, since we showed up later in the morning, this place was very busy (read: loud). The Hangry ($15) is the type of dish to order if you're, well, hangry. You get 3 eggs, 2 slice of bacons, savory chicken sausages, toast, and hash browns. To be honest, this dish was just a bit standard... you should really try their coffee-crusted pork belly.\\n\\nI opted for the Chicken Karaage Hash ($15) served with 2 eggs, green onions, sesame seeds, and Korean sweet chili over hash browns.\\n\\nThe fried chicken was boneless and had a nice, light, crispness on the exterior.\\n\\nBut seriously, if I haven't mentioned it already... try the coffee-crusted pork belly!"},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Not only did this place nab the best location on the Pearl St mall for daytime sunshine exposure (the old Bagel bakery spot), but they made this place a first class restaurant.\\n\\nThe tapas-like Latin brunch Happy Hour is genius.

Coffee here.  Eat here.  There's something for all palates and free WiFi at this signature Austin coffeeteria.\\n\\nI was a fixture (at least 4 visits per week) at Austin Java during my two-and-a-half year tenure of living within walking distance of the original Parkway location.  Breakfast at AJ provided a nice break from working in my home office.  Now, friends, Yelpers and ne'er-do-wells, I will share my wisdom with you.  I've got a lot to say so I'll keep it as concise as possible by giving you my pick for each section of the menu.\\n\\nCoffee:\\nThey make great perfume coffee (my grandpa's term for espresso drinks) so go for it.  But, the drip coffees are so flavorful that I typically order them exclusively.  The ceramic mug is the green option, but you can get a go cup if you tend to slurp coffee as quickly as me and are bothered by trips to the refill carafe every 30 seconds.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nGo directly to Queso Blanco, do not pass it by.  Sure, you can get queso from any of the 2,000 mexican cuisine serving joints around, but there's something unique about the QB @ AJ.  Get it.\\n\\nSoups:\\nIf you're only in for one trip to Austin Java (why would you ever limit yourself), the soup is for suckers even though it is killer.  Stick with the tomato basil, a soup du jour offering, if you must soup it up.\\n\\nSalads:\\nI love the house salad with chicken added.  The secret is the crushed pecans, which is pronounced PUH-cahns, not PEE-cans.  The Thai Noodle salad is a solid second choice if you're in the mood for something more exotic.\\n\\nPastas:\\nLook no further than the chicken penne pasta.  Go with the creamy version if you're cholesterol score is balanced, opt for the grilled version if not.\\n\\nBurgers & Sandwiches:\\nOrder the Black & Blue Burger.  It is devine.  The peppercorn sauce and gorgonzola cheese will send your taste buds to the moon.  You'll have to Write-off the afternoon make-out with your significant other or office crush, but it will be worth it.\\n\\nBreakfast:\\nBreakfast items comprise the majority of the menu.  All of them are good.  My favorite - far and away favorite that is - is the roll your own breakfast tacos.  Really.  No, I'm serious.  The BTs are simpler version of the migas, which are outstanding and enough for two lite eaters.  However, the price is much cheaper.  Ordering a single RYOBT results in nearly as much as the double order since the amount is up to the discretion of the chef.  I've yet to be dissappointed by the chef's heavy spooning of scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese & turkey sausage on to my plate.  Also, you should not refuse the salsa.  It really adds a lot to the item.\\n\\nSmoothies:\\nI'm inexperienced here but tasted a strawberrilicious once and seem to not throwing up.  I guess that means I liked it.\\n\\nDesserts:\\nTwo words: fresh-baked jumbo cookies.  It is so words cuz all I see when I read that are \\"chocolate chip.\\"\\n\\nThe End."},{"name":"Wine Bar George - A Restaurant & Bar","address":"1610 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We tried Wine Bar George for the first time.

We enjoyed the lobster rolls--buttery and soft, but i have to say that for 15$ the size of the dish and the amount of lobster was seriously lacking. The spinach and ricotta dumpling was a much better bang for your buck, but also not really what I was expecting (in a good way). I don't generally enjoy the texture or \\"look\\" of dumplings, but this was more fried and crispy rather than, pardon my choice of words, slimy and mushy, which is how most dumplings come off to me. \\n\\nFor my main meal I had the nova pizza, which was very good with ample salmon and capers--just how I like it. Again, the portion size here was way more appropriate, and I actually ended up taking half of it home. Made for a great breakfast. Mostly, however, I was very impressed with our server's attention to detail--one of the things that drew me to this restaurant for this particular dinner date was that my friend has to stick to a pretty strict gluten free diet. Yes she'll make the GI sacrifice for a beer here or there, but I was definitely trying to be very conscious of her needs when picking out a place to eat, and other Yelpers had mentioned an above average gluten free menu at City Landing. As soon as she asked to see a gluten free menu, Welsey went (what I felt) was above and beyond in being conscious of her dietary restrictions, with bringing gluten free bread (and a separate butter) for her, as well as making sure that the buns on her burger were gluten free as well. \\n\\nOverall, I was very pleased with the experience, and very to have found somewhere great to eat in the area."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is the classic at-your-table Japanese Steakhouse.

Table service was a little slow at first but then very good. \\n\\nExcellent customer service will have us coming back. We were waiting on a table when the owner said two seats at the bar opened up, but then the two guys sitting at the bar decided to stay. The owner then offered to buy us a round of drinks since we'd have to keep waiting. Mind you, we had only been waiting 10 minutes or so at this point. Just a super nice guy! Got a table a few minutes after that."},{"name":"iPho 2 Noodle House","address":"156 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"This place has amazing pho to start off and the staff is friendly. Ambiance is mellow and inviting. Today I decided to try something new. I had gone to another Vietnamese place off of bumby ave and had tried the pan fried crispy egg noodles with shrimp chicken pork beef and squid and it was so good I stood w the craving so I thought I'll try it here. Not what I was used to to say the least. I didn't enjoy it at all I picked out the meat and left the next of noodles with all the veggies present. Very disappointed. I chose going to this place because it's very convenient and close to my job, but from now on I think I'm going to make the drive to get to the other place I actually enjoy. For 12.00 it wasn't worth it to me I would've been better eating a lg bowl of pho filling me up. I never leave there hungry and today I did. Probably won't be back for a while. But give it a try to each is there own.

Really, just some pretty generic, run of the mill Chinese food, that is so like any other dine and dash eateries. I have been a couple times with my best friend, he loves the food here, but I have to admit to being underwhelmed. What makes it worse is that the prices are steep for what you are getting."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"401 Park Drive","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"texas cheese fries:  my mind is telling me 'no', but my body is saying 'yes'.\\n\\nthis is a good place to wait around for the bourne ultimatum to start.  conveniently located next to the fenway movie theatres.  the food is decent.  although i've never had a steak here, i've had fish, pork chops, mashed potatoes, etc.  all rather tasty.  nothing that'll blow your mind, but why would you expect it to?  \\n\\ni like the bread.  i'm not a huge fan of sourdough or sourdough-like breads and this one is more wheat-y.  sweet."},{"name":"Shoom Restaurant","address":"6555 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This Chinese restaurant deserves a 3.5 star. We decided to try this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day with my wife's family because my sister-in-law loved it when she came with her husband's family.\\n\\nThey initially had trouble finding our reservation, but all was resolved. We were led through the galley and, to my surprise, there were two semi-private rooms in the back of restaurant. The room we were in is large enough to seat approximately 30 people. I think we got better service by coming here for an early dinner. Our server kind of disappeared when the restaurant filled up. The kitchen must've been slow when we placed our order because everything practically showed up at once. The lack of pacing by the kitchen made the dining experience somewhat uncomfortable. We were juggling plates because there wasn't enough room on the table and food got cold before we could get to it.\\n\\nThe food was fairly standard for Chinese seafood/banquet-style restaurants. There weren't any dishes that wowed me. There was nothing that I must have again, but ingredients were good quality and cooked nicely. My only complaint of the whole meal was the fish and tofu with black bean sauce. There was too much sauce which made the dish unbearably salty. I actually had to scrape the black bean sauce off the fish.\\n\\nAgain this is a very busy place. So come early dinner and make a reservation. Overall, we were pleased with the quality of food and enjoyed our server's sense humor while we had her attention before the dinner rush."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},D={key:1};function G(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",O,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",R,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(H,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-add65448"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/1.md","filePath":"sponsor/1.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/1.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
