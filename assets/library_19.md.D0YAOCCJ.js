Surely a ramp could be put there instead.\\n\\n2) The portions are TOO BIG. It's just wasteful and unnecessary. My meal was actually a good portion size, but the pasta dishes were gargantuan. It's not impressive or family-style, it's just wasteful and gross. \\n\\n3) We wrapped up dinner just after 9 pm. I realize that the restaurant closes at 9, but we weren't the only people still there and it's not like we were taking our sweet time in ending dinner and the staff* began cleaning the tables around us. It was incredibly unpleasant and loud. They were slamming chairs and tables around so they could sweep, stacking dishes loudly to take them to the kitchen, etc. I feel bad that we were there after 9, but the clean-up staff really made us feel like we were being kicked out. I just don't think that's necessary and, if it absolutely has to be that way, customers should be forewarned that promptly at 9 pm the restaurant is going become very unpleasant.\\n\\nWe'll definitely go there again, but we know that when it's closing time, the seemingly happy, carefree customer service we received prior to that time will end abruptly. \\n\\n*The loud clean-up crew did not seem to include the waitstaff.

The fries here are some of the best I have ever had. There is usually a little sign stating what state or area the potatoes came from. Fries are served in a cup and the cup is usually overflowing with even more fries overflowing into the bag, they never skimp! They have free in the shell salted peanuts while you wait for the food. Place is always clean when I come in. It's neat how they call mustard \\"yellow\\" and ketchup \\"red\\". Sure it costs more than the big fast food chains, but with all the gourmet toppings included it's worth it. Take note that the small fries are enough for 2 to split, but you might not want to share when you realize how darn good they are! My only dislike is that they do not give you a plate to eat on but this probably helps keep the cost down and saves water/trees as well so it's all good.

I got the idea from the folks over at Buzzfeed which is seemingly the most fun place to work on the planet! A group of Buzz-feeders decided to go on a tour around their city eating their weight in tacos. It made me so hungry for tacos that I decided to do the same thing. Of course I started on YELP and visited some of the highest rated Taquerias around the city. Yum! This was an assignment I could really sink my teeth into and it's inspired me to do this every so often, experimenting with various genres and specific dishes. If anyone wants to join me, just let me know! :) **\\n\\nThe second stop on my tour was Tacos La Villa, I was curious about its great reviews and the fact that it used to be a Quizno's in a former life. In fact, all the Quizno's artwork is still on the walls so it's a bit of a mind-f*** to about eating authentic tacos there. But then you smell the food, you see the crazy lunch lines (seriously, don't come here at lunch unless you have the luxury of a two hour lunch break) and you know exactly where you are. \\n\\nThe tacos cost $1, you can't beat that! I ordered four tacos : Asada, Carnitas (my favorite), Chorizo and Al Pastor. I added a side of rice and beans and it all came to less than $7. Win! \\nSomeone told me that you know a restaurant is authentically Mexican when they wrap the meat in a double taco. La Villa definitely does this even though they don't make their tacos in house. I thought that might count as a strike against them but the tacos they use taste so good that, had I not SEEN the wrapper, I never would've known. \\n\\nLa Villa's uses flour tacos unless you request corn...I appreciate this as I learned that most places do the opposite and I just like flour tacos better. Their meat is delicious and flavorful and they don't skimp on it at all. My favorite taco, surprisingly, was the al Pastor. I say surprisingly because I've always been a Carnitas girl and this was my first time trying al Pastor so I didn't expect to like it so much but it was fantastic! There's a bar for your add-ins: cilantro, onions, various salsas and whatever you want. I wish the bar had cheese but maybe that isn't authentically Mexican enough? Either way, I was very happy with the first stop on my tour and ready to compare La Villa to other restaurants around town to see how they stacked up. **SPOILER ALERT** La Villa got my vote for my favorite of them all!"},{"name":"Stanford's Restaurant & Bar","address":"913 Lloyd Ctr","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"A solid place but not especially special.

Since that's all I ordered, I can't really comment on anything else except that Lynette got the Mac and Cheese and thought that it was rather flavorless despite being quite cheesy.

She did not come to see if we needed anything and had to ask another waiter for a soda and then she appeared with soda and bill and did not ask if we wanted dessert or anything else. My son's hamburger cost $12.50 and nothing came!

I work at a restaurant right down the street and will often come here with my co-workers after work for some drinks and food. I've never had a complaint about the food. In fact, the buffalo mac and cheese is amazing and I highly recommend it. However, my friend and I had such a bad time here tonight that I don't think we will be returning.\\n\\nMy friend and I sat at a booth next to the bar and ordered drinks and nachos and waited for some more friends to join us. Our friends got caught up at work and were taking longer than expected. Our server, Matthew, informed us that there was 10 minutes left until last call for drinks and 20 minutes left until the kitchen closed. I found that extremely bizarre since when does the kitchen ever close AFTER the bar? But my friend and I were actually all set on drinks so this was not an issue.\\n\\nWhen our friends did show up we informed them that last call had already passed. One of them decided to ask the bartender if it was possible to still get a drink, since it seemed so early for a last call. The bartender said that was fine! There had been no last call issued. The bartender also confirmed that my friend and I had been cut off by our server and that was the reason he was no longer serving our table.\\n\\nThis is when I got furious. As I've already stated, I work in a restaurant. I understand a server wanting to go home for the night. Had he asked us to move on over to the bar and close out with him, we would have done so. But Matthew decided to just lie to us and tell us the bar had issued last call and then he told the bartender that we should no longer be served. That does not sit right with me. We cashed out with Matthew and moved over to sit at the bar, where the bartender (a really nice guy) offered us another drink and commiserated with us. He got the manager for us. The manager was already aware of our situation and he did apologize, but he seemed kind of annoyed that he had to come speak with us about what happened. He said it has been a really busy night and that he had to host and food run. I don't know about you, but the last thing I want to hear when I have to make a complaint to a manager is how tired they are. It's Saturday night. I'm tired from work too. And the fact that he knew about our situation and did not come over to speak with us about it, and that we had to seek him out? That  was frustrating as well.

If your fork had gotten to the caramel sauce in that bite, that tartness will diminish quickly as the caramel will highlight the fruitiness of your bite. The overall idea here is that you're going to have a constant stream of sweet caramel despite any other flavor profile that may come swinging in. \\n\\nThe crust definitely more resembles a cobbler crust, so everything will crumble nice and soft in your mouth with a few bits of crunches. \\n\\nENVIRONMENT:\\nLarge, open, and filled with bright colors.

They no longer take orders at the front, so we sat down and a waiter promptly came over.  I asked him if they still served wine and he said no.  That is OK, not a deal-breaker.

He said no, if I wanted it that way to 'make my own bowl' option.  That was fine, too.  Perhaps I didn't order correctly, but either way, I thought I had picked the options that would best match my favorite dish before.\\n\\nWhat came out was a broth that was simply inedible.

The server was attentive and seemed nice.  \\n\\nFood: We had some delicious chicken livers and fried green tomatoes to start. Two simple, but delicious, apps that really showed the southern comfort food style I was looking for. The dipping sauces were great and I was left wanting more livers to scoop up the rest of the delicious dipping sauce with bacon.  \\n\\nFor the entree, I had the fried chicken with collard greens and cheesy grits. The buttermilk battered chicken went great with the sides and couple well with the slightly spicy and sweet sauce that was served on the side. The grits were amazing, I had to keep fighting off my girlfriend so I could have more to myself.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend had the BBQ shrimp. She loved the shrimp and the cucumber salad, but left the large mound of rice alone. We both thought that it was a pretty dry plate, save the cucumber salad. Jambalaya or red beans and rice would be a welcome substitute . \\n\\nDrinks: I started with the namesake drink, the \\"Hops n' Scotch\\". It was a very interesting concoction, but I think they might need to tinker with the recipe in order to make you order another. \\n\\n I then moved on to one of my favorite cocktails, the \\"Blood and Sand\\". It unfortunately came out very sweet with a little too much Heering and a scotch that lacked any smoke (Dewar's White label). I bet the same drink would be much better if the Dewar's were replaced with a peatier blend, like one of the Johnnie Walkers.  \\n\\nAfter much deliberation over their HUGE selection of whisky, I finished up with a dram of Laphroaig Quarter Cask. Can't go wrong with that!  \\n\\nMy date enjoyed her drinks, which were both on the fruity side. I had a sip and enjoyed them as well.  \\n\\nOverall: For a soft opening this was great. I look forward to going back and trying out the rest of the menu and some more single malts!"},{"name":"Silver's Delight","address":"2879 E Point St","city":"East Point","stars":"3","text":"Food was bland.

To follow up with this experience, I ordered my food and had all three of the other members of my party get their food before I did although I ordered first. So I was waiting patiently, then 30 MINUTES went by and I went to the counter and they said they made some sort of mistake and that it'd be out within 5 minutes. Another 15 minutes went by and nothing. So I went to the front and was taken care of promptly by Dylan and Matt. They were nothing but kind and very quick to amend the whole situation.

Turns out - it was with me!!\\n\\nI agree with my previous statements about the bread - although we liked it less this time. My husband LOVES bread and after a few bites of our second piece each, we agreed it was not worth the empty calories because it was not that great. In fact, it tasted as if it were a day or two old.\\n\\nWe changed things up food-wise at least:\\n\\nI got the Arugala, Endive and Radicchio salad with with Gorgonzola, Pine Nuts and Pancetta Vinaigrette and my husband got the Caesar Salad. Nice salads - nothing amazing, but not disappointing. Mine was very bitter but enjoyable overall.\\n\\nI had asked the waitress about the Pollo all' Assaggio (Chicken Stuffed with Prosciutto, Eggplant and Smoked Mozzarella Cheese topped with SunDried Tomatoes, Broccoli, Artichokes and Roasted Red Peppers in White Wine Sauce), as I assumed it was their specialty. She said about 50% of patrons do not like it. Hmm. That was a red flag, but it really intrigued me (and I appreciated her honesty!!), so I decided to try it. \\n\\nI was surprised when it showed up with red-skinned mashed potatoes (which were quite good - smooth & creamy with some nice lumps, as I like my mashed potatoes), but everything else was pretty much as described. I ate the entire dish and enjoyed it - but wasn't wowed. It was pretty plain and not as flavorful as you'd think, given all the ingredients! There was exactly 1 artichoke (split in 1/2) and a couple of nice sized broccoli spears.\\n\\nMy husband went with the Chicken Parm - which came with some nice penne. A pretty standard chicken parm. He devoured his as well.\\n\\nSo, the food was good and not too pricey, but the reason I can't give this 4 stars is the atmosphere.\\n\\nWe asked to sit downstairs because the reviews on here said it was cozier - and it looked cool. Now, I understand it was a Saturday night, but this place was LOUD. We could barely hear each other and were practically on top of the tables on either side of us. \\n\\nUpstairs was even rowdier - while waiting in line, a woman (the owner? manager? a regular?) kept being bought shots of tequila by the people at a table. She brought them into the kitchen and had one of the kitchen guys do them with her - then she made out with him right in front of us. I guess it makes for a few waiting experience!\\n\\nThis seems like a fun place for a group dinner. Not a romantic, quiet dinner for 2. Which ironically, is the opposite of what some other reviews on here say!\\n\\nI guess you'll have to go for yourself and find out! Just remember your visit - unlike me! :)"},{"name":"Gitto's Pizza","address":"120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Not very good.. better options close by with much nicer customer service.

I liked the two teas the most, and the coffee was fairly good. The matcha latte was okay, but I've had better at other cafes around Boston. As for food, I feel very neutral/indifferent about it. The avocado yaki pan was average. The shoku pan just absorbed so much moisture from the soy sauce mixed in with the avocado that the bread became so soggy. If the bread was toasted, maybe it would have been better. The Japanese breakfast bento was okay. The fish was cooked really well, but the miso soup was miso soup, and the small sides of rice, pickles, and potato salad were also okay. With the price being $10 and the bento reflecting the small portion sizing in Japan, I just expected at least more flavor and taste. I liked the miso pan, which is like melon pan but miso infused with the cookie crust on top. It was a nice savory spin to melon pan. \\n\\nThis place has so much potential, it just really needs to work on increasing their staff while serving the high demand/capacity.

If you get here afterwards, be prepared for a wait.  Our first time here, we waited about and hour for a table - it was PACKED, but, we enjoyed getting some drinks at the bar and hanging out under the christmas lights - very cool vibe.\\n\\nGet the crispy green beans appetizer - its amazing.\\n\\nThe main courses are all delicious.  I have had the Sausage and the Burger.  Both were excellent.  My wife has had the Dewberry Hills Chicken and Grilled Cheese sandwich.  The burger and grilled cheese were a higher class of normal bar food, and the sausage and chicken dishes were straight up delicious meals.\\n\\nThe bar selection is a good one.  They have a great whiskey selection, and I was given great recommendations each time (Balcones Blue Corn) - they know their stuff!\\n\\nContigo is an excellent date spot.

This 'restaurant' runs more like a cafeteria/cafe where you order food at the counter, have food served and clean up yourself. We went there and had two lunch sets. It's about 11dollars for a rice/noodle dish +drinks+2 appetizers+small salad , which was a pretty good deal, and a lot of food. Don't expect the drinks to be great. The thai iced tea was surprisingly not super sweet but lacked the tea and milk flavor. I initially thought the herbal tea was some tea from teabags but turned out to be a can of cold Chinese \\"herbal tea\\". \\n\\nWe liked the freshly fried sweet potato fries, drumsticks and dumplings(sides). The thai basil fried rice and Sakura ramen were also decent and came in generous portion. The base price for rice dishes only includes tofu and veggies.

They do not have menu items catered for children of this age and I wish that had been more noticeable when I was researching the venue. My parents and myself had their taco dish (TACOS DE ARRACHERA ESTILO BAJA-MED). Mom thought they were good,  dad thought they were 'ok' and I thought,  'Meh, I've had better'. Being raised in Texas I'm accustomed to 'good' sized tacos...the tacos here are half the size of a taco you'll get from let's say an authentic tex mex restaurant. The steak in my taco was not warm, neither was the tortilla. They had a hint of pineapple... and that's about all the seasoning that resonated with me from those baby tacos. No rice, no beans, no sides at all came with the dish. My girlfriend had the TLAYUDA OAXAQUE√ëA and she says it was really good; It was light which is what she was looking for. She was not able to finish it all and took some of it to go. We also had an appetizer of chips and guacamole; it was good. The guac was fresh and chips were crunchy. So we asked our waitress (who by the way was a little snide), if they had anything that a child would like and she recommended cheese quesadillas. The two barely touched them and the naranjo manager had no issues comping them; Nice customer consideration!

They took my nut allergy into consideration (much appreciated!) when taking our order.\\nThe springs rolls were good, but I felt a little overpriced for how many received.  The pad thai and pad see ew were very good.  My husband feels that the pad thai is better at Nong's, but I said I'd have to do a side by side comparison to decide if the pad see ew was better or not.  :-)  In other words, it was very good."},{"name":"Coppertank Grill","address":"3835 Main St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Great chicken wings........mmmmmmmmmmm"},{"name":"Hecho En Mexico","address":"2101 Montopolis Dr, Unit  23","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here.

First off, they are the closest restaurant to us, walking distance even, which is awesome, and also means we go there A LOT, and because we have been there a lot I am able to make all the observations I am about to make. I will pre-defend my upcoming criticisms by stating that we have eaten at many, many, many Thai restaurants al over the US, Europe and Asia and it is our absolute favorite cuisine. That said, Spoon is by no means the best, but it is very good! Specifically their Panang Curry, Massaman Curry, Pad See Ew and Coconut Soup (Tom Kha Gai, which is the actual name but if you say this the waiter will stare at you blankly) those tend to be our go-tos here. They have a great selection of drinks and their bar is very popular with the locals even on weeknights. It is easy to get a table here and is rarely a wait, which is also a plus. The employees are generally friendly but sometimes we do get a waiter or two that seems a little flustered or confused despite having worked there a while. \\n\\nNow for the cons. The price. This is one of the priciest Thai restaurants in town and I do not feel it is justified in any way because it is not fantastic and their portions are the smallest I have seen. We never have leftovers, I can easily eat a whole dish which I absolutely never do with Thai. Not only is is pricey, but their prices actually went up. Before you were able to order a Pad Thai for example for $10, which would get you a basic noodle dish without the addition of any protein. Now you have to add a protein which bumps it up to $12-17 depending on the protein you add. Which brings me to one of their proteins specifically: their chicken. I'm not sure how they prepare the chicken but it is possible the toughest, overcooked, most flavorless chicken ever. I usually pick it out on nights where it is particularly bad, but it is pretty consistent. I used to be able to order my noodle dishes without a protein after discovering this fact, alas I now always order the chicken because I am forced to and it's the cheapest one. \\n\\nOH! Their sides of rice are like 8oz at best (I know because I weigh my food, some of us foodies do diet on occasion!) When you get takeout, only 1/3 of the container is filled and it is the same portion when dining in. When getting takeout I will either make a pot of rice of my own or go to the Chinese takeout down the street for a proper box of rice at the same price.\\n\\nAnyway, do not let the chicken or the portion sizes deter you from trying Spoon, like I said, it is a great place with ample space, good service and decent food, and in a city with limited good Thai options, you don't have much to lose anyway!"},{"name":"Celeste","address":"21 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"A cozy modern interior with an open kitchen and traditional Peruvian food makes this an interesting experience in Somerville's Union Square.

When we first walked in, we had McDonalds large drinks in hand and take out in our bags to eat later. We were informed that outside drinks were not allowed so they took our (non-alcoholic) diet cokes from us. Fine, I suppose we understood that they wanted to make money off of us ordering off their menu. When we start off our reservation, a friend of mine simply reached into her purse to snack on 2 (count that, TWO) french fries. She did not take it out of her purse to begin eating it on the table. An employee promptly walked in to let her know she could not eat outside food either. We realized there are cameras in all the rooms at that point. When my friend started singing, he had stepped up on the couch momentarily. Not even 5 seconds later, an employee came in to let him know he could not do that either. About an hour or so later, after I had been sitting on the table where the song selection screen was (after many of us had been doing this all night), we were THEN told we also could not sit on the table. We could not believe how many rules and the lengths they were going to in order to let us know we could not do multiple things that evening. We were also the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT. It seemed as though the staff was either in a bad mood or just strict AF. We had realized that it had been more than 2 hours (in fact, we had hit 4) and went to leave. We were extremely upset at the fact that this staff had ZERO PROBLEM walking into our room multiple....MULTIPLE times to let us know of the things we could not do, however they clearly were conniving in the fact that they could not walk in after our original 2-hour reservation to let us know time was up and to ask if we wanted to keep going. Instead they let us go to 4-hours which results in a $200 bill. It was very clear what they were trying to do which seems completely unethical or, at the very least, evident of lack of morals. \\n\\nMoreover, their song choices are few and far between in terms of English songs. This is definitely catered more to foreign songs, likely Chinese, Korean, and/or Japanese. The lack of proper functionality of the song selection screen was appalling. You would try to search an artist, let's say Lady Gaga, by typing in the letters and you could not find it. However, if you scroll through the \\"overseas artists\\" you are able to find it that way...you just have to scroll till your finger tips want to bleed.\\n\\nI am an avid karaoke-venue goer (hi, i'm an Asian who grew up in Asia) and I strongly...nay, VEHEMENTLY do not recommend this venue to anyone. You are far better off at Limelight Studios in Boston. While the hourly rate is slightly more expensive, I promise you it will be worth it in terms of the friendly staff, proper approach to service, and moreover, their much more extensive song selection.\\n\\nAgain, I repeat, DO NOT GO HERE."},{"name":"Pampas Buffet & Grill","address":"983 Broadway","city":"Everett","stars":"3.5","text":"This place wasn't that bad a couple years ago, but things has gone downhill since then.

They had used to come by with meat to your table, however you have to go up to them now.  And when you do go up, they weigh the amount of meat you get so you don't go past a certain amount, making it no so quite \\"all you can eat\\".  The meat itself was dry and salty and tasteless.

And not only street carts...but  real restaurants! With, like, bars, and tables, and servers, and food. It was an amazing discovery. And here I was, thinking Rainey was just about martinis, mezcal, and shots of whiskey at Black Heart. I mean it is...but it was on one of those evenings that my friends and I found ourselves at El Naranjo. \\n\\nFrom what I recall, we slipped in under the buzzer. As in, we had no reservations (but we weren't cool like Anthony Bourdain), and it looked like they had taken their last table for the night. But huzzah! A friendly hostess let us in, and our foray into traditional Mexican fare began. \\n\\nThere's a small bar directly across from the entrance, and you're allowed to take your cocktails outside while you wait. I'd recommend commencing your experience with an El Naranjo Martini: Tito's Vodka, orancello, fresh orange juice, and bitters. Maybe two if you have time. One of the hotties behind the bar will gladly shake it up for you, and come on--the restaurant is named after an orange, Get in the spirit(s) of things. \\n\\nWe were seated at a corner table, which provided another level of intimacy in an already dimmed, subdued ambiance. Well, the lighting was subdued; the din of noise was just enough to signal people were having a good time, but no one was quite ready to dance on a table yet. Which is kind of where I was at the moment. I was wondering if I had time to run over to Lustre Pearl and borrow a hula hoop to bring back to the restaurant and get a party started when the server came up and brought us our starters: rolls and some delightful pickled vegetables. \\n\\nI'm pretty sure the friends I were with have never seen the words \\"queso fundido\\" without placing an order for it. I'm no fan of queso myself (I know, I know; but please, put the stones and pitchforks down, we all have our \\"things\\"), but I have to say this was a rare exception. Thick and meaty, with mushrooms and Oaxacan style sausage, this queso fundido is surely not to be missed. I also enjoyed the fresh guacamole that accompanied it. One of my dining companions ordered the black bean soup, and she reported that she enjoyed it thoroughly. So far, so good. \\n\\nIf I remember correctly, our server recommended any one of the three styles of chile relleno; half of us ordered the Chile Poblano Relleno with slow-braised pork, while a friend and I split the Chile Relleno del Norte. It was wonderful, from the flavors of the sauce, to the savory meat inside. And clearly, you can tell this was crafted with the utmost attention and care. \\n\\nWhen discussing El Naranjo, I've heard people refer to it as \\"authentic\\", \\"interior Mexican fare\\", and \\"definitely NOT Tex-Mex\\". They are all correct. But I particularly like what chef Ilania de la Vega herself had to say: \\"If you talk to me about authenticity, I don't know what you mean. If you say tradition, then I'm with you.\\"\\n\\nClearly, it was that sense of tradition that took an Austin food cart, and elevated it to a fabulous Rainey Street restaurant that I am so thrilled to have found.  \\n\\n4 Stars."},{"name":"Pita Pit","address":"5717 Dalhousie Road","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Always looking for a healthy lunch option.

I've been going here since I was a small child for family dinners, soccer celebrations, birthday parties, etc. It seems that as the years go by, the quality has gone down hill a bit however. Because of my love and respect for a small business like so, I give 3 stars. \\nThe other night, my partner and I ordered pizza after a long day of work, seeing as we were just too tired to do anything else. We called up Pizza Caboose and ordered our pizza. They said it would be about 45 minutes to an hour for delivery, no problem for us at this point! We finally receive our pizza and spikes at the time they estimated and sat down ready to grub on all the delicious food. Now, we've ordered delivery with them multiple times in the past and there's never been an issue with the food. This time however, it was quite the opposite. The pizza was so misshaped, we HAD to pull out a measuring tape because we were so confused. It was the tiniest \\"large\\" pizza I've ever laid eyes on. It measured 10\\" instead of 13\\". I know, a few inches big deal right? Well it kind of is when you are spending 20 dollars on just the pizza alone. The taste and texture of it was as if it had been sitting under a warmer for a good half hour before being boxed up and sent out for delivery. The bottom of the pizza was not crunchy whatsoever, it actually seemed like it was undercooked with how soft it was. The spikes were extremely cold and had the texture of old French fries instead the hot, crispy spike we were used to. We called them up right away and they sent us a new pizza. We opened the box and actually laughed pretty hard at the difference between each one. By the time we got the second pizza, another hour later, we were so turned off by the last one and trying to eat just one slice, we let it cool and put it in the fridge to eat the next day and going to bed instead. I'm not sure how busy pizza caboose gets on a Monday night but even if they do...I've worked in the food industry for 5 years now and every restaurant I've worked in, if there is any sort of to go, the kitchen inspects it before it leaves their hands, then the worker in charge of bagging everything up and getting it ready for the customer/delivery should take a look at it as well. Seeing as the customer can't say anything after they leave or it's delivered to them. I'm not sure how a pizza like this is allowed to leave their restaurant with the quality it was at...I do thank them for the free pizza to make up for it. But it's not really worth it when I have to wait 2 hours for that pizza and it being almost 10 by the time I got it.."},{"name":"Floramo's Restaurant","address":"213 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"Awful.

The hostess practically rolled her eyes at us when we said 7. It was already 650 pm and the restaurant wasn't crowded. So we definitely felt her attitude. Our server was OK. It took over 15 minutes to get our cocktails from the bar. Our appetizers came in a timely manner. However we waited forever for the food. I questioned the waitress if the kitchen was understaffed as it was over an hour we had been there. She looked at me with surprise and said no and offered to call a manager . Our food then came, she slammed the plates down and no manager ever came by. Another family had to box their food up bc it took so long. As another reviewer mentioned,  The portions are smaller and the prices are higher and the service is gone. I dont know if we will return which is a shame because the food had always been good.

The uncovered part is mostly picnic tables for larger groups, and there is a covered part that's got lots of fans, and then there's the area around the bar with a couple of tables.

And the restrooms are awesome! Again, feels like you're at a ranch. It even smells like a ranch without the animals. So relaxing.\\n\\nWe had some cocktails: El Pipino and a Moscow Mule. Both were delicious and well-made, but the Pipino was the clear favorite imo. The cucumber flavor came out fresh with the lime and mint. So tasty.\\n\\nThe boy ordered the Rabbit and Dumplings, I ordered a Hamburger and Fries and we shared the Pigs in a Blanket to start. Everything was delicious. My hamburger was perfect (for me)! Nathan said it was too rich for him, but considering that I eat a hamburger about once every couple of months, if that, I don't mind rich. It was on a challah bun! The rabbit and dumplings were quite comforting, but I wouldn't recommend it in hot weather. \\n\\nThe only downside really was out service.

Food.  Yesterday we were in Austin for the day and decided to try it out.  We arrived at a little before 5pm.  \\n\\nHe ordered the Frida Kahlo and I ordered the Marie Laveau.  Since it was our first visit we were offered free fries.  We also wanted to try the onion rings so ordered some of those.  We were told there was a 30-minute wait on burgers, which was fine.  The counterdude suggested that we should buy some alcohol from the nearby convenience store, so we ordered waters and my husband went to buy a Steel Reserve tallboy.  \\n\\nThe wait on our hamburgers wasn't as long as mentioned (around 15 minutes), which was good because our company on the patio was a large group of drunken hipsters who were loudly and profanely discussing strip club visits/strip club politics.  So I'd say this is probably not a good place for kids, based on that.  We don't have kids, so we just did our best to ignore the noise and have our own conversation.  \\n\\nWhen I went to get the burgers, I was told by the counterdude that they were out of onion rings.  He said he was sorry but the cook hadn't told him that they ran out after some catering done earlier in the day.  He did not offer a refund, instead saying that he gave us a few more fries and we could have free onion rings the next time.  Not sure if that will work out since we have no proof, but whatever.  Giving us the money back would have made a lot more sense ... we only go out to eat in Austin once or twice a week and there are so many places to go to ... we may not be back for months, and I'm sure by then the offer of free rings will be forgotten.  He also said there'd be ketchup at our table but there wasn't, so I got some from inside, as well as a plastic knife with which to cut my burger in half.  \\n\\nSo when I did that, I noticed that my burger was plain.  Yes, it had the cheese and boudin filling, but it had no tomatoes (I'd asked for no lettuce or onions but still wanted the tomatoes).  I went in and asked the counterdude for my tomatoes, and at first he wanted to argue with me that the sandwich didn't include them, but then after looking at the menu he said, \\"we're not carrying tomatoes right now.\\"  What?  If you are out of an ingredient, even a humble one like tomatoes, you need to tell customers that when they order something that contains the ingredient.  Or at least make a sign or put a sticker on the menu or something.  Why would a hamburger place not be \\"serving tomatoes right now\\" anyway? There were plenty of nice tomatoes the last time I went to the grocery store.  \\n\\nThe burger also did not have remoulade sauce that I could discern.  It may have had a tiny hint of mustard, but remoulade sauce is not mustard (it usually contains a tiny bit of mustard but is mostly mayo, veggies, and spices).  Despite this, it was quite good, but I would have liked some topping or sauce so that I didn't have just (admittedly stuffed) meat and bread.  If I'd known about the absence of tomatoes, I would have at least asked for a substitution of pickles.\\n\\nMy husband liked his burger and I liked it as well when I tried it.  It seemed to have all of its toppings, and the chorizo definitely complimented everything else.  He says he wants to order the Frida Kahlo again rather than trying something new.  I might order the Marie Laveau again if the ingredients are actually available.  \\n\\nThe fries were good.  They are my favorite kind of fries, soft brown ones.  I'll definitely order them next time ... my husband can eat the free onion rings if we actually get them.\\n\\nUnlike other reviewers, we did not have digestive troubles afterward.  Instead, we just said over and over how much we liked our hamburgers.  But we can't give more than 3 stars because of the weirdness with not being refunded for an item that we paid for that turned out to be unavailable, and the service issues such as the counterguy's attitude about the absence of tomatoes.  Hopefully in the future refunds will be issued if items are unavailable, and customers will be informed if menu items are going to be served in ways that do not follow the menu descriptions."},{"name":"Espadas de Brazil","address":"2512 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic service and the breakfast tacos were AMAZING!

They do not mess around! I arrived around 10:30am, which would have been fine on any other weekend, but I came on Labor Day + it was the big UT vs. Notre Dame game.... so we waited 5.5 HOURS!!!!! I know, it's outrageous. Apparently it was the longest wait time in the entire history of la Barbeque. The food and customer service was so good though that I'm not letting the long wait time (which was honestly more my fault than theirs) affect the review. Next time, I will 100% pre-order the BBQ to save me my Saturday.\\n\\nAnyways, we prepared like most do - with a 6 pack of cold beers and some snacks. They do offer FREE BEER towards the front of the line, which is amazing!, but I think most people bring their own munchies. There are tons of picnic-style tables and benches for you to dine there or take a quick rest, although we opted to eat at home in the AC. Also, if you are really getting hungry, there are tons of food trucks in the same lot where you can get cold drinks or snacks. A good chunk of the line is well sheltered from the elements by large tents. \\n\\nAbout half way through the line, they started to run out of the good stuff (like ribs.) We were so bummed but we finally made it to the front and were able to order brisket, pulled pork, turkey, coleslaw and beans. We sheepishly begged them for any morsel of left over ribs, and THEY GAVE IT TO US! One little piece. I know it sounds like nothing, but I was extremely impressed with the effort. Our order also came with half a loaf of bread, 2 types of BBQ sauce and pickles that were free of charge. Everything was incredible... the brisket was so tender and tasty, not too salty. We ordered the turkey to be adventurous, not expecting much, but it was the tastiest turkey I've ever had in my life. The coleslaw had a great chipotle kick to it as well! We ate the rest for leftovers throughout the week and it was still just as delicious each time I heated it up. Dare I saw it was worth the wait!?\\n\\nThe only reason this is not a 5/5 star place is because it's massively inefficient. There was ONE poor lady cutting, weighing, and packing the meat. And the window to pay was BEFORE the window to order. How does that make any sense!??? There are so many easy ways to increase the efficiency of this place...

What I love even more is that I can come to Austin for two days and eat an incredible three-course meal (of course accompanied by incredible margaritas) for approximately 2/3 of what it would cost in MA. That being said, the Salty Sow is more than just a good value; it's an overall well-crafted experience. From the very attentive, informative waitstaff to the particularly unified and curated interior design, the owners and management of the Salty Sow have been paying attention. The atmosphere is dim without being dark, quaintly rustic without silliness. It is more than just a gastropub, though it follows in that trend. \\n\\nAnd then there's the food: we tried the bone marrow, which was delicious but could have been slightly more plentiful. We then had the pork chop and the pork shoulder- and both were perfectly prepared and scrumptious in very different yet savory ways. We also had the turnips (I genuinely didn't know a turnip could be that good...) and the Brussels sprouts. Though Brussels sprouts have been a go to since sometime around 2007, I've got to give it to the Salty Sow- theirs were crispy leaves with just enough tang and salty crunch, with no hint of the sodden mini cabbages I knew as a child. I fear we skipped dessert because I would have died. \\n\\nBut the drinks also deserve a shout out. I love the frozen margaritas of Texas. They are not like that anywhere else. That said, I love the frozen margaritas of El Chile, just down the street from the Salty Sow. But the Salty Sow wins, hands down, in this competition. My POC ordered a non-frozen to start, and he, not the biggest fan of anything even nearing a girly drink, loved their pink-toned 'Rita. \\n\\nSo there you have it. The Salty Sow was great, all the way around. We had a reservation and were immediately seated, even at 8:30 on a Saturday. We were served well, and what we are was scrumptious.

Either way. I get about 1/2 through and I start realizing that I am going to food coma when it is finished. And then I am useless for at least an hour afterwards.\\n\\nAnd so it goes.\\n\\nHere's how the gyro breaks down:\\n- The lamb is chunked rather then sliced. This is different then what I'm used to but still good. The chunks are big and the meat stays moist and flavorful. It is the best when it gets some char on it for crunchiness on the outside!\\n- They use parsley which is clean and refreshing. I do, however, miss having more vegetables. I guess I just don't prefer meals that are so meat heavy. I like a healthy meat to veggie ratio.\\n- The pita never really holds up. I try holding it more delicately, but I always seem to punch holes through it.\\n- The sauceeee. Its good. Tangy. Just the right amount. Although I would like more garlic.

The chicken was billed as \\"Honey Fried,\\" but it almost seemed more like it was baked with a slightly spicy skin.  I got the sense that it was something that people looking for a subtle flavor would really enjoy, but despite being very juicy it wasn't nearly crispy enough, or \\"honey\\" enough for what I was expecting.  The waffle with more of that Sriracha Maple Butter was nice, but just okay, and the whole dish seemed to be more conceptual than practical.\\n\\nThey could also do better with the history motif.  There's nothing particularly mid 1800s about it, or clash of cultures centered, or even 'riot-y' there.  And I understand that they want to pay tribute to that part of history with the menu which I kinda got...but not entirely.  It's basically just a small bar with a hipster post industrial design to the decor.  It's also overpriced, but for that part of town it seems to fit in nicely.\\n\\nAll told, the menu and staff alone earn it about 4 1/4 stars.

Man was I disappointed.  It was no where close to what I was expecting. The sweet peppers on the sandwich overpowered the taste of the meat. There were way too many grilled onions on the sandwich.  They were primarily used as a filler which would make this $10 lunch seem more than what it was. He claimed it would have plenty of meat. Nope.

Unfortunately, my experience tonight deserved one star. My friend and I ordered food at 8:29PM from a lady cashier. Meanwhile, one employee with the twist up mustache, who I'd later go ask about my food, was distracted talking to the chefs about shooting and drivebys. Maybe he was on break, who knows. We waited til 9:13, until I finally decided to go and ask the cashier, who was now the mustache guy, about our food. I explained to him how long we have been waiting for, and how I noticed that other groups of people who ordered after us received their food first. During this whole time he never looked me in the eye and didnt feel like he took customer service kindly to heart. He proceeded to ask me what I ordered as he looked through what receipts he had near his register. No luck. He went to the chef's queue of receipts, no luck. Then he told me that their registers were down, so they werent printing out receipts (but I received a receipt to sign for my card), so they never had our orders on queue. He asks me if I want to wait for our food or get a refund, instead of immediately getting our food made their on the spot. We got our refunds instead of waiting. No need to yell at the guy, just got our refunds and left. I understand that it was the register that was the issue. I just wished he would have gave better customer service. At least he could have looked me in the eye and admit the error with sincere apology. Instead he left two customers frustrated and disappointed.

The appetizers and entrees came out about the same time with probably about a minute stagger. Didn't get enough time to enjoy the appetizers but it was tastier than the entrees. For appetizers, we ordered the grilled bone marrow, mexican corn and guacamole which was very good. The entrees fish tacos were Okay but the lamb shank stew and rice and beans were tasteless.

Sweet Lord, he spoke the truth.\\n\\nI received a brief primer from the exceptionally friendly hostess who seated us on how to turn the meat faucet on and off--flipping a card seemed simple enough.  And so it went through beef, lamb, sausages, chicken and garlic, and buttered rolls.  I've always been a fan of roasted beef and of good fatty sausage, but in an attempt to get the most for my money, I avoided veggies entirely and loaded-up on meat.  After countless portions of skewered meat, a nasty food coma came on.  I was lethargic and bewildered, overwhelmed by the speed of the servers and their skewers.  Increasingly, I was unable to turn my table card to BASTA! quickly enough and meat began to accumulate on my plate.  By the time I flipped my card over once-and-for-all, there was an entire plate of meat left to finish.  Not wanting to wasteful and hoping to impress my mate by eating enough meat to make me completely useless for 12 hours, I dove in.\\n\\nMeal finished, we drove home.  My stomach was literally distended.  I had enjoyed my meal, but even though it was only 7PM, I was unfit for anything but lying on my side and listening while my stomach made noises like an old radiator.

How many times have you been able to say that about an egg? It was like having a second condiment atop your fries. So yum. The bearnaise is more of an herby aioli, and that is perfectly fine by me. It was a little refreshing but still crazy decadent and rich. It was very flavorful and along with the egg and fries that could have been my dinner all on its own. Since it wasn't good enough to come all the way out here to try one dish, I also split the pastrami salmon with a friend. We were floored. It is so well seasoned and perfectly cooked to just fall apart. You get crunchy, toasty, but still chewy bread, pickled onions and another aioli-like sauce to DIY some salmon crostini's.

Now while the appetizers and desserts were very enjoyable, the entrees at Salty Sow were lacking. Perhaps it was due to the fact that we arrived for a late seating (930PM; they close at 11PM) but based on sheer pricing of this place alone, I cannot give them a pass. Bone marrow was very nice but I must point out, I am a sucker for the dish anywhere I go. The french fries were ok, nothing special. The desserts were definitely the best part of the meal (I do not even really like sweets) as both the banana foster and chocolate cake were great; do keep in mind the cake is super rich and the banana foster is a must try. As for the entrees, nothing stood out. The beef shoulder was dry and lacking much flavor to the extent that we immediately wanted hot sauce. Meanwhile, the duck was nothing special and the chicken was average as well. \\n\\nAll in all, I would say go for a glass of wine and have a few desserts after eating dinner elsewhere.

Brings menus to our table, never clears them (I had to place them at a neighboring table). Forgets our wine order until the middle of entree course. (Admittedly, he waived the wine from our bill so he knows it was absurd). Does not offer cracked pepper on Caesar Salad. Did not clear our 1st course plates so I had to flag the water girl to clear the plates. Water girl also brought out the entrees for the record. Eternawait to get the check, then another 5-10 minutes waiting to get the bill back. Note: I still left 18% because he took the wine off, so I consider it a fair trade for this review ;) \\n\\nThe food: \\nBread: awful - at least day old. Crust hard as a rock. \\nApp 1: Stuffed Cherry Peppers - literally like something out of a jar at a dive bar. Over-saturated with vinegar. \\nApp 2: Caesar Salad - I literally could taste my SO's cherry peppers in my salad. Being in the food industry (a big reason why I'm off Yelp), I know for a fact that the \\"chef\\" used the same hands/gloves in plating my salad as my wife's app. Cross contamination risk anyone? Beside the overwhelming vinegar taste in my salad, it was mediocre at best. Cheap cheese, ribbon cut lettuce. Not peppered (see above) and the dressing was devoid of any anchovy or seasoning. \\nKid's Entree - Ravioli - kids loved it. Kids also love Chef Boyardee. These ravioli were clearly microwaved for prep. Hot and cold spots and served within 4 minutes of ordering. \\nMy entree - Linguine with Clams - teeny tiny portion of pasta, clearly box variety, swimming in packaged chicken noodle soup broth. It did remind me of eating soup at my grandmother's in 1987 out of a box and using less water than called for to really get that wallop of powdered seasoning, but hardly the nostalgia I was expecting from a North End Italian resto. \\nWife's Entree - Gnocci - mushy and terrible.

At El Naranjo, they also bring you out some bread with little ramekins of orange butter, some sort of spicy compote, and pickled vegetables. The butter was really yummy. For dinner, I ordered the Pastel Azteca, which the waitress described to me as a mexican take on lasagna. It was corn tortillas layered with goat cheese, almonds, raisins, and spinach.

I first walked by the joint earlier in the day on my way back from Trader Joes, the scent had me thinking about it all afternoon so I checked the menu online and returned with a friend for happy hour. OK, I need to be clear, I eat primarily fish and veggies, so I knew I was limited to the trout as my main. The sandwich portion was VERY small, and I would swear the trout wasn't even smoked or put on a grille, it seemed like it was pan cooked. Seemed to have literally no seasoning, the cole slaw topping overwhelmed the fish so badly that I almost stopped after the first bite to leave it alone. A disappointment when I wanted to match the BBQ vibe as closely as possible to my partner's brisket. I did try some of it, and it was actually very good, I would totally recommend it, but again, the portion size was pretty slim, and we aren't big guys, I could see a real BBQ-freak being insulted by the cost per meat ratio.\\n\\nThe sides were pickled veggies, nice and a good variety, the mac n cheese... ummm, I really had hoped they would be baked with a gooey cheesy top since they came out in ramekins but they really seemed more like they were cooked in a large batch first then doled out into the cups, sprinkled with corn meal then tossed in a salamander broiler to finish. Doesn't cut it, and the cheese was bland making the whole dish under-seasoned. Shit bitches, throw some cayenne on there or at least a little pepper, or use a more hearty cheese.\\nThe cornbread was good but definitely not served warm as advertised, just a leftover tasting cold muffin. If hot, or better yet fresh from the ovens periodically, they could be lovely. The beans were, again, under-seasoned but at least well-cooked tho the sloppy cornmeal topping was runny and unappetizing, I have no idea what it was supposed to be but it did not turn out well. Yuck. Not cool dudes.\\n\\nSo, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say the regular meat items are probably good but overpriced, but the rest left a bad taste in my mouth, in every sense. Our server was very polite, attentive and cheerful, she is great at her job and we still tipped well since none of this was her fault. If you go, maybe consider the sampler with three meat choices and stick with pickled veggies and request a warm cornbread muffin and you may come out ok, tho much poorer for it.

This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether you intend to get within a mile of another human being during the next three days.)  And the goat cheese lent it some moisture that the pesto side lacked (the tomato sauce helped, too).\\n\\nI think they may have changed their crust recipe, because although it was still definitely a thin crust, it was nowhere near as thin, crunchy or \\"crackery\\" as others have described it.  I would've categorized it as more or less your average thin crust pizza.\\n\\nAlso, they have a hibiscus tea that I assumed was herbal (since most hibiscus teas are), but I don't think it was, as I was EXTREMELY alert that afternoon.\\n\\nI appreciate that they carry a wide range of toppings (including goat cheese, gorgonzola, prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, both basil and sundried tomato pesto, portabellos, etc.) - I have a soft spot for pizza places that give me a wide variety of choices, even if they aren't all perfectly executed, like the pesto pizza I had on my first outing.

THAT was amazing. Rich, creamy, chocolatey... definitely something to make a chocolate lover happy. \\n\\nSomeone in my office brought in a box of chocolates and each one I've tasted has been really good.\\n\\nI have a couple of issues with this place:\\n1. As someone already mentioned, the prices are pretty high for the portion size. It's a niche market and the owner has a masters degree in chocolate, but except for that one hot chocolate, I don't think it was quite worth it, especially with Flour just a few steps away\\n2.

In fact, I would pay to see a cage fight between anything from Rosticeria Cancun and the wimpy, flavorless, heatless Bolocco \\"burritos\\" everyone drools over. I can tell you that an RC pupusa would absolutely body-drop a Bolocco. It would make that Bolocco its bitch. (Imagine two burritos wrestling. Cute, right?)\\n\\nRosticeria Cancun is a teeny tiny little hole-in-the-wall storefront in Maverick, with maybe nine stools, a tiny bar, and no actual counter at which to order. (You kind of hang in the space between the kitchen and the \\"restaurant\\" itself.) If you're like me, you order off the menu in extremely broken Spanish--which itself comes with a kind of nasal-faux-Italian-by-way-of-Pennsylvania Dutch accent--and for some reason, instead of using the only word you actually KNOW in Spanish (\\"gracias\\") you instead say \\"k, thanks, bye.\\" \\n\\nBut no worries. Non-counter help is friendly and kind and quick, and I promise I won't be such an [insert Babelfish translation of \\"ri-TARD\\" here] next time.\\n\\nFood is fantastic. I mean this. The food is unequivocally authentic, served fresh and hot (read: just fried) and tasty. I would easily give away my firstborn for just a side of rice and beans (how does someone make a simple protein and grain taste that flavorful? Ah. Yes. Lard.) All of the meat is tender, spicy and delicious. The salsas and hot sauces provided are zingy and tomato-y and fresh, with actual jalapeno seeds floating about. I didn't even get mad at the piles of cilantro. Three tacos, rice, beans, salad, and half an avocado (?) set me back less than $9, and constituted at least 2 meals. I think pupusas and tacos a la carte are a buck and change; burritos somewhere around $5-6. Nothing tops $13. What. The. What.

Based on the name, I was half expecting a frou frou juice/vegan/raw place (which I wouldn't have hated, but not ideal for brunch), and was pleasantly surprised to find a menu full of vegetarian takes on classic diner dishes. \\n\\nThe place was bustling, and we were told there would be a short wait for a table or we could have a seat at the counter, which we happily elected to do. I loved being able to watch all the kitchen action while I ate. \\n\\nThe food was excellent. I had an omelette with brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and asiago topped with sun-dried tomato pesto. The pesto really made the dish--I often find sun-dried tomatoes to be overpoweringly savory, but the sauce was perfectly balanced with basil and not too much oil. It came with the classic sides of home fries and toast, but kudos to Veggie Galaxy for jazzing up these two diner workhorses: thick, chewy sourdough toast with olive oil and thin potato rounds with rosemary are a far cry from the usual greasy spoon fare. \\n\\nThe service was attentive and friendly, and prices were low--especially for this girl, used to $25 NYC brunches (and that's without a drink!).

When we asked the server she confirmed there was not supposed to be in the food.   We were then told the chef does whatever he's in the mood to do on any particular night.  Really!!!!!!

Shortly one of the staff, maybe the manager, came over to let me know they were making me some linguine but the lobster was all gone.  Really!!!!!  You wait until the other meal is ready to tell me I have to find something else to order.  Unbelievable. I ended up with nothing and two hours of my time wasted.  They did buy us a glass of wine which was little consolation for them ruining the evening.  This was supposed to be a special even for my guest on her Birthday. Instead it was a nightmare.  I'll just add this, the one and a quarter lb lobster was far from it. It was a chix and there was barely any meat. $27 for a $5.00 lobster and a bowl of linguine.

We made reservations ahead of time and were greeted at the door politely and seated in a very timely manner near your kitchen..... your open kitchen.\\n\\nOur waitress was Kaitlyn and she was very attentive and sweet.  She promptly asked us what we would like to have for beverages for the evening and was even so kind as to share some of her favorites when we asked her what she may recommend as we frequent the Theatre District often but it was our first time visiting your restaurant.  After we made our choices and got our drinks I couldn't help but take in the aroma and the  atmosphere of the restaurant in and then we found our eyes fixated on your kitchen.....your open kitchen.   \\n\\nWith that statement, let me explain.  It made our first trip to your restaurant our very last. \\n\\nWhat we observed made us shake our heads in surprise and disgust.  We observed your cooking crew at length and saw that not one of them were wearing gloves at any time.  We observed that 2 (1 in the back and 1 in the front) were not wearing hats or nets or hair protection of any kind.  We observed the gentleman in the front who handles all the tickets wipe his face with his hands and then move his hair with his hands towards his ear and then proceed to pick up a spoon and add some sauce to the plates and then pick up some greens to put on the finished entr√©e with his bare hands that just touched his face and hair. He at no time put gloves on or washed his hands.  We were shocked.  Another waitress then came over took the two entrees that he had just touched and brought them to other patrons in your restaurant.  I wanted to scream out loud don't eat that. \\n\\nAt that moment our dishes came over and I politely asked Kaitlyn if there were some sanitary rule, sanctions and/or  protocols for a restaurant when handling and preparing food and when she looked at me in surprise and embarrassment I told her that it was not anything that she had done but we were not going to eat those dishes and informed her on what we had just observed.  She stated that she didn't know he handled the food and she stated that she thought he just handled the tickets.  She apologized profusely and asked us if we wanted to speak to the manager.  We stated most certainly.  She then asked if we wanted to have our meals redone and we stated that we would see how it went when talking to the manager.   A tall man came to our table, apologized, informed us that he would have our meals redone and then proceeded to tell us that he told his crew to go downstairs and put on hats and stated that particular individual who had long hair in the front and short in the back thought that he was Bobby flay from the Food Network, we were not amused and didn't appreciate him trying to be funny or disrespecting his staff regardless of what we the patrons observed.  He then told us that he himself has returned/refused food for the very same reasons as we did and completely understands our reasoning and that he recognized it and stated \\"that's the problem with the open kitchen concept\\".  Really???\\n\\nOur \\"new\\" meals then came over and before we took a bite we again looked over at the kitchen crew.  The man in the back did not put on a hat he put on a bandana, but at least it was covering his hair.  The \\"ticket\\" man in the front did not put on a hat he put on a bandana as well, however he didn't put it on correctly, he was wearing it like a headband and his hair was still fully exposed.   This is disgusting. Our entire visit to your restaurant not one of your kitchen staff what so ever put on gloves at any time.  This is shocking and incomprehensible, even the workers at McDonalds wear hats and gloves.  We would not have ever expected this from a restaurant in Boston. \\n\\nThat being said I hope that this be a very big lesson that things need to change.  Negative comments travel fast, VERY FAST.  We were very disappointed and will not return to your restaurant for food again.  We are not looking for reimbursement for our meals, we just want you to  recognize the numerous kitchen errors and fix them FAST.  Its unsanitary and disgustingly gross.  \\n\\nKaitlyn was fantastic, the drinks were excellent, the atmosphere is wonderful and very Boston. The food however.......

I'm sure Contigo has the rain-scenario planned out to a T, but I'm curious what happens when it starts to rain... do they usher in all the outdoor people under the roof?? What about all their food and dinnerware?? Does it get crammed?? It was rain-free when we went so luckily no one had to flee with their meals in hand.\\n\\nIt's very rustic and quaint, and as my bf pointed out, all the waiters/waitresses had some sort of sweet Indiana Jones attire going on that I totally dug. I don't think that's a requirement, but they did all look awesome in their linens and neutrals and belts.\\n\\nMy only major complaints are that I hated the chairs, even though they look awesome and exceptionally Indiana Jones-esque, they could easy fall backwards and the chair-back was very high, I wasn't comfortable sitting in them. Their menu is also somewhat limited, especially if you're not an adventurous eater or not big into meat; there's sausage, rabbit, steak, chicken, octopus, pork pates, etc. I'm pretty lame when it comes to choosing my meals, I usually opt for veggies or fish/shrimp so it took me a while to figure out what I wanted.\\n\\nI decided on the grilled cheese. Do I typically go out to eat just so I can get a grilled cheese sandwich? No, because I can make that at home. So it's kind of a bummer that I dropped $10 on grilled cheese because nothing else sounded appealing to me, but on a positive note the grilled cheese was pretty delicious. Something about fluffy brioche and melty cheddar with apple-wood smoked bacon and pickled tomatoes. My bf enjoyed his burger and our waitress recommended we swap one of our fries out for the fried green beans which was an excellent and slightly lighter choice. I tried a bottled Ciderkin as well, it was an interesting but good combo of fermented and sweet.\\n\\nOur waitress was super attentive and helpful in making suggestions, and from what we did eat we definitely enjoyed.

My favorite items were the plating of the samosa, potato cake, chickpeas/peas with the 3 sauces that are at the front of the buffet but the server put together for me and the malai kofta - which are dumplings with a mix of veggies and cheese in a creamy almond sauce.  Overall the dishes were not spicy on the buffet.  I missed the heat and some of the Indian spices that I usually get at other Indian restaurants and Trader Joes frozen dishes.  The tomato in the paneer tikka masala sauce dominated the flavor of the sauce and it wasn't as creamy as other masala sauces I have had.  The spinach was vibrant in the saag which can be expected but usually I taste more spice when I have it at other places.\\nThe buffet is reasonably priced at $12.99 and you can get wine by the glass for $4.50-$5.50 - the selection looked good too!\\nIt wasn't that busy when I was there so it looks like a good place to catch up with friends and also for groups - there was a group of 15 people there and it looked like it worked well.\\nService was good."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"We arrived at this location after purchasing Holloween Costumes for our boys.

My only suggestion would be less nutmeg as after a bit the nutmeg seeps into the drink giving a weird taste. We started with the honey croissants because....honey!!! Half were flaky the other was not. But still quite delicious. I could have eaten the honey butter with every part of my meal. My husband ordered the fish, I had country fried chicken, my son had the sirloin and my other son had a kids mac and cheese. My chicken was crispy, fresh and tasty with an amazing white pepper gravy on too. I asked for corn on the Cobb but received corn not on a cobb No big deal. Still delicious.

She said she would get a side of chicken, but we told her never mind, it really wasn't an issue for us.\\n\\n5 minutes after we got the nachos; we may have taken 10 bites total of these enormous nachos, we got our meals.

But, knowing our food was sitting there under heat lamps, we decided to move onto the main dishes.\\n\\nOur waitress boxed the nachos for us... but really... who wants to eat nachos later? They are never good whether you put them in a microwave or oven; they aren't enjoyable later.

I have managed some very nice restaurants in my day and I will say that what happened was not only unacceptable but pathetic. It was handled poorly by our server and the manager. As far as I am concerned you live and die by you reputation in the North End, and apparently Mama Maria doesn't really care about it anymore. I will never return and I will never give a good recommendation. So for anyone thinking about Mama Maria for dinner or a special occasion...I say think again.

Finally they did find a lighter but c'mon! it was already late and past closing time so I'll give them this, they didn't kick us out.. But there were many areas to save time before this.. and each one was drawn out.. even at the very end.. unpacking the cake, placing in on a (too small which made the cake uneven to cut) plate, to initially having us wait over ten minutes then walk us to a table and then have to walk back as the table wasn't ready and yes the place was nearly empty. Sigh.\\n\\n*I had called earlier in the day about purchasing a full cake.. to get a personalized one made they need two working days..  which is fair... but to buy a full one already in stock seems pretty reasonable, right? Well apparently not because \\"It's against business policy to sell a full cake they need them to display in the cake box at the front\\" even tho, it was full including several full cakes, undisturbed and one would have been perfect!  Oddly enough I received the same statement last year from a member of their staff and I spoke to the owner the following day who told me that there's no such protocol.. And, he would deal with the issue and it wouldn't happen again... Hmm.\\n\\nI'm not saying I'll never go back to VG but I'm seriously navigating my next haunt to head to for birthday celebrations..

I had the former, I should have paid the extra $2 for something green. The sauce itself isn't bad but isn't mind blowing either.

Hubby had the smoked wings. He said they were good but he's more forgiving than I because I thought they were a little dry. The hubs makes some damn good smoked chicken so maybe my standards are just too high considering the fact that restaurants have to turn over high volume. Anyway, I had the BBQ pasta.

I have been to this place a few times over the years and I know that I can't order the Buffet here because it lacks Indian spiciness or the great flavors I look forward to.  I know this but I was too hungry on Sunday for lunch and saw Samosas, Saag Paneer, Daal, dosas, some rice cake dish that I had never seen, plus a tasty looking cabbage and vegetable dish.  I went with my stomach over my prior knowledge and grabbed the buffet.  \\n      The buffet wasn't bad, just a little blah!  Yes, I know some Indian places offer this bland Indian Buffet because of their clientele, but at least stick one spicy jalfreezi or vindaloo dish on it.  I was hoping that one of their meat dishes were going to have some spice but none did.  I noticed that other reviewers enjoyed their buffet so I guess it is just my need for Indian Spicy that drags my review down.   \\n       Now, I have eaten here and really enjoyed the meal but I ordered it.  I would recommend ordering from the menu if you really like Indian.  The Buffet is there for me to take someone who is scared of Indian food.  It isn't bad as I enjoyed the Saag Paneer (Spinach & Cheese) a lot and I liked the variety.  The Samosas were a little too mushy and didn't have crunch.  The buffet food wasn't all that hot (temperature wise).  I will return but I will order from the menu unless my stomach  overrules my brain again.

Hardly a meal and like no chile relleno I've ever known.

The rest of the staff seemed in a huge rush to move the meal along, snatching plates away as if we were on a deadline, and one guy actually told me grumpily that he'd give me \\"a few more seconds to finish\\" and stood there waiting. Unbelievably unfriendly service in an upscale establishment, really, when a party is spending several hundred dollars on a meal. We were out of there in under an hour.\\n\\nLike the rest of the tourist trap that is Rainey Street, this establishment is a converted home, a la Kerbey Lane, so you'll be dining on original hardwood floors and looking out original wood frame windows or at walls covered by vintage 2x6 planks.

We start with Sate Selections children kebab with peanut sauce and acar it was so good,The best vegetarian Fry rice I ever had! I love the way they steamed the veggie so you can still taste the crunch and the freshness of everything and it was well season! My husband had the Gule Kambing the Grilled rack of Lamb cooked in curry sauce it comes with steam rice and veggie and their famous mango chutney ,he said it was tender and well seasoned everything was fresh and so tasty. for dessert we could not just try one. We tried the Colenak which was highly recommended by our waitress, and we had the Kolak Pisang they both was very good.

It was supposed to be crispy on top, but the shell was so hard I couldn't cut through it. The actual belly was not very tender and a substantial portion of it was just pork tenderloin. My dad liked the candied pork belly pretty well. My mom was disappointed with her chicken entree, though I thought it was ok.\\n\\nThe desserts came back and stole the show though. We got the creme brulee which was solid and the banana foster beignets which were FANTASTIC.

I was again pleased to discover that they'd included a plastic fork, a cup of ice to go with my can of soda, several napkins, and had even thoughtfully taped the lid onto my potato salad, just so it wouldn't jostle loose and spill all over the inside of the bag. I know all that's pretty minor stuff, but there've been plenty of times where I've ordered takeout from other places, that forgot to include the essentials: napkin, fork, etc. It just made me think that the folks at TJ's put in that little bit of extra effort and care -- the way your Mom might when she packs your school lunch.\\n\\nOkay, so maybe I'm being sappy.\\n\\nAnyway, I'd ordered the gourmet Italian, and the sandwich was big enough that I only ate half and could save the rest for later.

I'm being completely honest when I say every bite of food I tried (from all 3 plates in my company, in addition to my own) tasted like bliss on my tongue, resulting in a satisfied food coma shortly afterward.

And believe it or not, I could not get enough of those brazed greens (I think that's what they were called; not the mustards). \\n\\nI'm telling this story all backwards... Really inexpensive, but super delicious - you have to have the sourdough bread grilled to start.

Also, their cider drink (you know I never remember names...) left me feeling like it was officially fall. Mmmm.\\n\\nFinally, desert.

Everything I've had here has always been so tasty. There are so many menu options, seriously, you could stare at the menu for a while and still not be decided on what to order. The servers are also pretty open to making menu changes if required - never seen folks who were so accommodating. In terms of great choices - the portobello mushroom burger is amazing with the potato salad as a side. The buffalo chicken burger provides a spicy kick and is great for those who enjoy onion rings in their burger. I would recommend the plain French toast (with a sauce or fruit on the side) as opposed to the stuffed French toast. The stuffed French toast mainly seems to have sauces as the 'stuffed' portion rather than cut fruit as it is in many other restaurants.\\n\\nThe wait time does get pretty high here but plan ahead to put your name down and you'll likely be pleasantly surprised by the actual amount of time you'll have to wait. \\n\\nThe one downside to this place is that I believe the 2 person table seating on the back end of the restaurant is quite cramped, and the place would benefit from spreading that space out to either more restaurant area or minimizing a table to make guests more comfortable. \\n\\nPSA... if you order a milkshake, you get a LOT of milkshake, so plan to share or stay away if you can't handle the SHAKE. \\n\\nLove their decor, love the friendly and relaxed vibe, love everything.

Tender, flavorful meat with warm grits and egg/avocado. For sweet: the cherry French toast and graham cracker waffle were certainly memorable and satisfying, but the financier with the prism of yogurt was my favorite.

The quesadilla has changed - more onions than before, but it's still very good.  We used to fight for the last bite of dip, but not anymore; it's not nearly as good now.  I get the impression that they don't make it themselves; either that, or it just sits under a warmer for too long.  I used to love the chicken strips; they come with fries and 3 sauces. They've also got some salad choices, and a mac and cheese that's not too shabby.\\n\\nOverall, the value for the money is what gets Stanfords the 3rd star.  Their service has always been acceptable.

Location is convenient and parking was manageable. We ate greeted as we walked through the door amd it was announced that we could take any seat. The only available table was directly next to the door so we took it. The door slams incredibly hard every time someone enters or exits so it did become rather annoying after the first dozen times. That plus it was cold outside so a gust of cold air came with each slammed door.  I ordered the smoked wings they were very good, good flavor and properly smoked.  I would say that they could have cooked a little longer for my taste, my meat still clung to the bone and I prefer when it falls off the bone. Minor detail aside I would definitely prefer them again. Also had the nachos made with home made chips with the pulled chicken, it was loaded with cheese, jalape√±o and tomatoes and the portion was huge, it was also incredible. I have never enjoyed or encountered nachos this good before. My husband had the ribs and was very happy with his decision. There are a few bottles of different bbq sauces on the table that he enjoyed. For his sides he had grilled corn and potato salad. The corn was raved about but the potato salad had to much going on and it had a strange texture almost gritty so pass on that.

First thing I noticed was the decor and how high school art project it looks, everything is air brushed and is just tacky. They could have saved a bunch of money and been a little classy at the same time but I guess that's the mentality of people that cant run a business. So we sit down (wife and mother in law) and order drinks that seemed to take forever to get a draft cider when the bar was empty basically. Ordered two appetizers as entrees the fried food platter and nachos and a veggie burger for my wife. We literally sat there for 45 minutes before the waitress came back and said the kitchen is a little behind and that it would only be five more minutes (drinks we all empty by now and didn't even offer a refill) mind you she wasn't busy and there seemed to be about 20 waitresses there doing nothing but wiping off empty tables and chatting together. Well five minutes turned into twenty and the fried food platter came out by itself (ordered as an entree) fifteen minutes later the nachos came out and another fifteen minutes later the veggie burger came out. it was 8:30 by this time and we had enough. all of the food was your typical nasty bar fare with nothing that looked worth eating. the nachos had obviously sat under the heat lamp for too long because the chips all had burned tips and the olives were cooked. the cheese tasted like chalk and the veggie burger was a joke.

Some cups of sauce were included and they had sauce available at the table as well. \\n\\nHonestly we were blown away by the quality of the meat. The beef rib was incredible, tender, smoky and just loaded with flavor. The brisket was from the lean end and yet was moist and tender as could be, perfectly smoked, exploding with flavor. Just awesome. The chorizo sausage was excellent, and the best we enjoyed on our trip to Texas. I felt guilty using any sauce at all because the meat in no way requires any, but discovered their sauce is terrific as well.\\n\\nWe tried 17 different bbq places on our trip. La Barbecue tied with Franklin for the #1 spot. If you haven't been here, just go. Wait in line if you have to, it's well worth it  (or preorder 5 days in advance and save the time).

At points parts of my dish were really salty, and in other parts lacked basic seasoning.  It was very confusing.  The rest of the flavors paired together were a little bit strange.  Nothing was terrible or worthy of sending it back, it just wasn't for me.  \\n\\nI think that if I were in the area again, I'd find another place.

Billed as \\"famously irresistible since 1955\\" on their menu, I was actually a bit disappointed by how it was presented.

To be fair, the cheese bread was good but I've had better.\\n\\nIf you're undecided on what to order here, the Special Mixed Grill ($74.95) might be a good option. You get a small portion of rib steak, tenderloin, and strip steak as well as 2 grilled prawns and truffle mashed potatoes, beets and mornay mushroom sauce.\\n\\nI opted for the 20 oz Canadian Black Angus Bone-In Rib Steak ($74.95) served simply with mashed potatoes. The steak is a bit leaner than the regular rib steak because it's raised on a barley-based vegetarian feed and prairie grass. They did a good job of grilling this steak. I think I should have picked the regular rib steak because I actually like my rib steak a bit more fatty.\\n\\nWe finished off our meal with their Key Lime Pie (10.95) with fresh whipped cream. It's difficult to find a good key lime pie and we were pleased that this version turned out to be pretty good.

Then over the years of eating it you started to like it and ate more of it. Then your grandma got that smile and piled a mountain of it on your plate and said eat eat eat! \\n\\nThat's what this place is like. It's like eating at grandma's house where the recipe has been cooked the same way for generations, handed down on scraps of paper or for the really good stuff, never written down, just whispered in your ear. This place has it's following because you feel like you are at your Italian grandma's house and they stick to the basics of family home cooking. It's not haute cuisine or big bold flavors, it's old school Italian family cooking at it's best.\\n\\nI had the Veal Saltimbocca: veal, mushrooms, prosciutto, mozzarella, butter wine sage sauce $22.99 with fresh gnocchi $3. Veal is hard to come by on the West Coast because it is felt to be politically incorrect. Luckily, your Italian grandma on the North End Boston doesn't know who PETA is. ha ha, just kidding. It was quite good and as expected at grandma's house you get a mountain of it. I could barely finish half of it. I would order this again but get spaghetti instead on gnocchi. I am kind of fussy about gnocchi. I loved the veal, understated elegance and cooked to perfection. My chicken saltimbocca is work in progress, but grandma has it dialed in. If you want Italian home style family cooking with massive portion sizes, this is it. We came here for our anniversary with our daughter and her fianc√© and had a very memorable meal.

I messaged back but that's not public, and I am adding a star to this review because that sort of attentiveness and attitude is really worth acknowledging!\\n\\nTorn between a 1 and a 2 star rating...going with 2 because ultimately, the things you're supposed to eat are edible, the things you're supposed to drink are drinkable, and the folks are nice.\\n\\nHowever.\\n\\nWe are so inundated (blessed? cursed?) with foodie bars, mixology-enabled restaurants, amazing local breweries, etc etc, that frankly, there's pretty stiff competition for anyone who wants to open a drinks-oriented place with a basic menu. \\n\\nOur server Diana, incidentally, was lovely and meant very well. It would have been nice if she had known anything about whiskey (or if knew things, shared them...), but she was helpful on the beer front and kept a big table happy for a few hours, so that was nice! Kudos on that front.\\n\\nDRINKS: I am such a whiskey lover, and I was so sad. Both the beer and whiskey selections at Hops N Scotch are mediocre at best. Are there a lot of entries? Sure. Yet they're terribly curated, presented with no context, and unimaginative. We tried several flights (beer and whiskey) at our table of 8 and found nothing interesting. The \\"wee tour of Scotland\\" (or something; their basic Scotch flight) was appallingly boring. The international flight had one, from Austria, that was literally undrinkable. (Coming from a girl who drinks Jim Beam neat. I can be a snob, but I'm not fancy.) Oh, and cocktails were bad. Specialty list was a bit odd, some hits and some misses. Then they royally messed up a Rusty Nail. That's TWO ingredients, one of which is whiskey.\\n\\nFOOD: The thing that really killed this place for me, though--other than the endless sea of college-aged hipsters standing in helpless, date-seeking clusters--was the food. It was technically edible, and in fact the scotch eggs were pretty good. But I ordered a charcuterie plate for $15. There are whole restaurants now that just do charcuterie within 10 miles of this place. What did I receive? COLD, pre-sliced pepper jack cheese, some unidentifiable, similarly presented cheese that may have been a young, processed cheddar, and a brick of cold brie, served with a few rolls of prosciutto of supermarket origins, and a few round slices of hard chorizo, ditto. Some cold grapes. Chicken liver pate about which the comment was made, \\"this is really bad mustard,\\" and a couple of helpful pots of honey and a fruit buttery thing. I mean. Seriously. I am a grownup. I am happy to eat a meat and cheese plate you put together because you didn't know I was coming...but at least have the decency to call it a meat and cheese plate and not charge me fifteen bucks for the pleasure. Two crappy meats. Three crappy cheeses. Sigh.\\n\\nOkay, I have done with my ranting. Other food items included unexciting chicken clubs and short ribs billed as an entree and served on side plates. I will spare you my ranting about the inexplicable place settings ---why doesn't a whiskey place have whiskey glasses, instead of stemless wine glasses? why are there different tasting sets for different whiskeys? why are some of your side plates round, and others square?--and leave you with all this, and photographic evidence, if I can figure out how to add it."},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Fenway","address":"1348 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went in an ordered at about 6 pm on a Friday, it wasn't overly crowded but there were quite a few people.

It is certainly not high class and there is always a local drunk or two who are buzzing hard at the bar.  \\n\\nI first came to China Cuisine and fell in love with the beef there.  Both the teriyaki and the mongolian beef I ordered were blow your mind good.  It was amazingly tender and melted in my mouth.  This was for dinner service.

I can see why the local alcoholics flock to the bar side of the place.\\n\\nI am marking down a star because I went during the day for lunch service and the beef let me down.  I'm not sure if they are only as good with beef when the rush of dinner service is there, but I went back for another lunch and it was the same letdown.  For some reason the dinners have much better beef and I am in love with it.  I wonder if there are different chefs during the days and nights... either way it is inconsistent and is worthy of the star knock down.\\n\\nThe last time I went there, I ordered from the sushi bar.  I ordered a couple of sashimi orders and I was very impressed that the sushi chef came over to me to tell me that the red snapper was no good for sashimi.

Now as I passed the car in front of me on his right to turn into the Southside parking lot, the police officer closest to my lane was under the initial impression that I intended to drive right on through their 2-cop barricade of South-bound Congress, but he quickly realized I was just picking up a Pizza and he went on with chatting with the other police officer as they blocked south-bound Congress.\\n\\nThat being said, the pizza was ready and I quickly paid and departed.

Although they try to balance out the flavors with some raisins tossed in there, I ended up adding some of the honey-butter goodness from my fried chicken plate (see below) to combat this offense.

I definitely give a star for this dish.  My other two stars are allocated below.  Chicken was moist and tender on the inside with a nice crunchy outer coating.  It wasn't greasy and they bring it out piping hot so you can still enjoy the crispness of the skin and it allows the honey sauce to just \\"coat\\" and not drench them to a soggy demise (we all know we don't wanna go there).  The biscuits were good too, and the best part that tied everything together?  The honey butter sauce at the bottom of the plate!  I swear, once we discovered this golden treasure, we started using it on everything else hehehe.  Given that it was a happy hour plate, the portion size was on the generous side.  We definitely appreciated it as this was our fav part of our salty sow experience.  \\n\\n6) BANANAS FOSTER BEIGNET\\n-disappointed :(  Subtle banana taste on the first bite then you get desensitized and the beignets become a boring one-dimensional fried piece of dough in your mouth.  Don't get me wrong, they did achieve a relatively nice crispy coating on the outside but the inside was way too dense and forgettable.  I just wish they didn't name it bananas foster as they did not deliver anything close this in flavor.  For me, I enjoyed the side of nutmeg vanilla ice-cream the best, and although my companion wasn't a fan of it, he did point out that it was the saving grace of the beignets themselves...so, that speaks volumes :/\\nTo make matters \\"worse\\" for this dish, the dough to ice-cream ratio continues to leave you wanting..not necessarily more, but...just...wanting.  You get four large slabs of fried dough and one mid-sized scoop of ice cream. I suspect an extra scoop might cost ya $5 as it is listed as a separate dessert item too.  \\n\\nMy other two stars go to: one for the service and one for the general set-up of the place -clean venue with a comfortable and inviting atmosphere.\\n\\nThey have a good amount of space in the actual restaurant with both indoor and patio options but as expected in Austin, parking is limited.  We were lucky to snag the last spot in the lot and this was about 10mins after they opened.\\n\\nOverall:\\nWe concluded that we would give this place another shot IF we happen to be in the area again, and mainly to get multiple orders of the fried chicken and biscuit :)  We just did happy hour this time, but if we had a re-do, I would like to try the candied pork belly as well.  That decision being heavily yelp-driven as my eyes and mouth usually team up on my stomach and, judging by everyone's pics, they will probably win out again ;)  Plus, I am hoping that maybe the candied crust could quite possibly be that sweet partner I've been looking for to marry my salty sow ;)"},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This will be my new love lunch spot. =)\\n\\nMy sister, her mans and I came here for lunch for the first time today and loved it!

The sandwich was well made and visually appealing, and I actually really liked the chickpea filling. What threw me off was the Daiya cheese, which had a disturbingly chewy texture since they use tapioca starch in it - it was like eating warm, cheese-flavored mochi. The side potato salad was legitimately delicious. My boyfriend ordered a jackfruit BBQ sandwich sans bun, which was highly recommended by other Yelpers but sadly didn't hit the mark for us either. It is what it is - barbecue flavored jackfruit. If you've never had jackfruit, the texture is similar to artichoke and not vaguely meaty. We also ordered a Taza chocolate cheesecake to share that was pretty good. It had a very impressive vegan merengue, but the cheesecake base itself was a little too tangy. \\n\\nIn short, don't come expecting the food to actually taste like non-vegan diner favorites.

Started with the Redneck Egg Rolls (pulled pork, coleslaw, cheese in a deep-fried shell), what's not to like, and yet, was a tad excessive, considering we were about to get piles of meat.  The meats were just fine, a little bit of pink smoke ring evident.  Texas Toast had a little unusual bitter aftertaste, sides were sufficient (coleslaw), but not wow.

Specifically ordered a quarter pound of chopped pork, and a quarter pound of chopped brisket.   No sides.  Nothing else but water.  After problems with their price board being incorrect and charging me more than it said, I got my \\"quarter pound\\"s in two teeney cups (and not packed in).  OK.  I didn't carry a scale to weigh them so I can't  evaluate the representation.  BUT, if I were EVER to go again, I would weigh it upon getting home\\n\\nAs for the product overall:  Dried out and low on flavor for both.\\n\\nNice sauce, but as any Texan knows, the meat is the key.  Sauce hides a bad product.  Try the meat first at any BBQ place you go to before putting any sauce on it.  That tells you whether to go back.  This was not one of those places for me.  The problem may be that the meat is probably not smoked here, on site, and was probably done elsewhere and shipped in.

I booked a reservation a few days in advance for their Thanksgiving dinner, as I live in Boulder and my boyfriend was coming to visit but both of our families are in the Midwest so we wanted to eat out. My boyfriend and I are younger, and immediately on walking in the door we felt incredibly awkward, as we had about 5 staff members look at us and walk by us or turn up their noses and do something else. On finally being greeted we were told that we would not be seated for about 15 minutes as there wasn't a table available, despite our 8:00pm reservation. However, we weren't seated until around 8:45pm. Initially at our table we were greeted by a young busboy who was friendly and cheerful and made me hopeful after our unfortunate initial experience. However, our server was immensely snobby, and treated us the same way we felt on first walking in the door. I read a previous review by a woman who felt disrespected because of her age, and I resonate with that very strongly. We ordered from the Thanksgiving menu (I believe slightly different than regular), I ordered the pasta and my boyfriend the chicken marsala. My pasta was very good, (hence the two stars) but the marsala was subpar, to the point where my boyfriend couldn't get himself to eat more than half of it. While I was in the bathroom the chef came out and was pointed to my boyfriend by the server, apparently telling him something like \\"that's who doesn't like your food.\\" My boyfriend loves food and cooking, and I have worked as a server my entire life, so we both know food and the restaurant industry well. However, we felt entirely disrespected by the condescending waitstaff, and were not very impressed with the food.\\n\\nIn summary - If you're under the age of 35 don't expect decent service as you will be treated like a child. Also, don't come hungry on a busy night because you will likely be waiting for up to an hour.

The food is delicious. I consider myself an expert on spanakopita and tiropita as I regularly make both these dishes myself. Athan's versions of spanaokipta and tiropita are a little unorthodox (the do not use phyllo dough) but they are nonetheless delicious. The filling is comparable to the Greek originals. As I mentioned in my previous review, the gelato is also exceptional. And while I don't consider it the greatest, the coffee at Athan's is pretty decent. \\n\\nHowever, there's something amiss about Athan's when it comes to customer service. Firstly, they have a credit card minimum. This is a violation of their agreements with all the major credit card companies. If you're going to accept credit cards, you have to accept credit cards regardless of the amount the customer charges. It's a fact of business. IMO, credit card minimums are bad business. If you have a problem with people charging small amounts, offer a cash incentive instead. Moreover, a few months ago when I was at Athan's someone who I presume was a manager or the owner asked my friend and I to move from a table with three chairs to a table with two chairs so as to accomodate a party of three that was waiting. This is not problematic in itself, but the rude and abrupt manner in which we were asked to relocate definitely put me off. The management at Athan's needs to get a clue about customer service. Perhaps their food is just so awesome and their business so good based on the food alone that they don't care to improve. One more thing... do the math when you pay cash. I've been short changed a few times. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say the cashiers just made a mistake, but consider yourself warned."},{"name":"Helen Asian Kitchen","address":"1070 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Stuff and environment is good.

Initially, the vibe and the menu sound tasty and fun. The gents working there are so super awesome and sweet. But the reality is that the burgers are ok but the wait is painfully long & not at all worth it. We ordered two of the buffalo like burgers. After over an hr wait we got very cold fries, five tiny cold onion rings and a very dull burger. The quality of the meat and buns seemed good. The cheese & peppers which were suppose to be stuffed in the burger were only discovered on both burgers in the very very middle for one bites worth. There really was no presence of a \\"buffalo\\" flavor to the burger. So overall, the experience was sadly, DULL and not even remotely worth the wait. There is no way this burger or eating experience compares to a Casino burger. \\n\\nWe also ordered a burger for our two lil girls and for the first time they  refused to eat their burger. \\n\\nThe real topper to the whole experience was the filthy level. The woman's bathroom should be condemned & a full redo done. One of our lil girls was walking and slipped on the floor, due to what seem to be grease that we didn't initially see on the floor. She feel extremely hard due to this fact & was bruised. The outdoor tables were disgustingly dirty & sticky. The outdoor area was also riddled with flies. One of the cooks had a white apron with a vast area of  black grey grossness on it. I know these aprons get dirty, but this thing looked like it have never been washed & worn for over a month. \\n\\nWe did get one very special present after eating the food at Mom's......the big D! \\n\\nOverall, I want this place to do well, due to their indie nature, yummy sounding menu and personality. They have a great spirit about them but really need to speed things up, order a book on cleanliness and work on making warm food for a better price.\\n\\nEdit: Got to give big props to a genuine, caring & quality concerned set of owners. Mom's owner did reach out and they are trying to remedy all the issues I pointed out. It might have been a bad day when we went & they are taking care of the sanitary issues and slippery bathroom floor. Definitely worth trying again with such awesome owners trying to do the right thing.

It was 20 minutes before we had any drinks of any sort (including water). When water was brought out, a full glass of ice water (in a heavy glass glass) dropped on a two year old, and then broke on the table. All of us at the table understand that accidents happen and water spills and that it was in no way intentional, but there were very little apologies made until the parents and the child were walking out to their car to leave. It wasn't until that happened that our server got some extra help, even though she had asked for it several times before that. People had to constantly reorder drinks that they never received- eventually people just started ordering directly from the bar itself. I will say that the food was good! My order came out wrong, but it was still good- kudos to the kitchen staff! When the bills came at least half of them were wrong. Tried talking to a manger about our experience and he was less than helpful with any of it and seemed to keep making excuses. The service was horrible all around.

Maybe it was just me that night, I would give it another shot. The mashed potatoes were good, skin on.  The salad was fresh. We got boneless buffalo wings that did not impress at all. They were adequate at best. Not bad enough to return, but I certainly wouldn't waste my money on them again.  My son had the chicken parmesan which was a good sized portion and he enjoyed it. My dad had a burger that he enjoyed, but didn't have a great eye appeal to me. \\n\\nI would say, that if you are looking for a pretty decent local meal within the confines of Stoughton, you will do all right at Foley's. Would I be thrilled to go on a romantic date here? No. If I wanted to grab a low key decent meal, I would give it a shot. One word of warning, because the restaurant is small, they usually have quite the wait on weekends.

The meat came away from the bone easily and had the perfect balance of smoke, sweet, salty and other spices I can't place.  My shark eyes turned black within moments of sinking my teeth into the first rib and damn near bit through the whole bone.  The waitress was very pleasant and oh my GOD am I glad she had the serendipitous insight not to walk too close.  I might have chewed her arm off in my feeding frenzy.

Also, the noodles were very dry. My wife had some sort of rice dish with pineapple and chicken. The rice was very dry as well as the chicken, which also had no flavor/seasoning.

My mother in law loved both cakes so much and was so happy to take home the leftovers (we took both cakes to a cabin near Mt. Rainier). Not cloyingly sweet, and very much Japanese bakery style in terms of delicate flavor and texture, and very light. The whip cream on the cake was not over-whipped and was delicious ! For those that don't know what japanese style cakes are like, the cheesecake is not the dense cheesecake with a graham crust. It is more like a cross between a cheese cake and a cake - no crust, just a lightened cheese cake like cake all through out. It is a cute little cake, just right for people who don't want too huge a portion. The strawberry cake has two layers of fresh strawberry in whip cream, between layers of soft and lovely sponge cake. The frosting is not a heavy or overly sweet buttercream, but a light and delicious lightly sweetened whip cream. There are strawberries up on top and customized writing. Traditionally it is ordered for XMas in Japan, but I love these cakes year round! Be careful when traveling with such a cake, it is very delicate (cooler highly recommended, or get it home quick). I would love it so much if Oyatsupan introduced cake slices in their display case, but then I might never leave lol."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here after 11 on a Friday night.

So it'll be long as I explain, hold on tight.\\n\\nFirst, they have been on my list of places to go for quite some time - I've heard lots of really good things and the menu looked very interesting.  So finally, we decided to hit it the weekend of Valentine's Day as our \\"special place to check out\\".\\n\\nWe arrived a bit late, but I had called and let them know, so I felt fine about that, especially since the place was still quite empty (we had 5:45 reservations, arrived shortly before 6p on a Friday).  We were quickly seated in a more isolated booth next to the kitchen - my favorite type spot, although this one ended up with issues (see below).\\n\\nService was a bit hit and miss for us - things like one fork being taken and one not, one plate being changed out, but not the other, when we ordered wine, the conversation was more difficult than it should have been, we were never offered extra bread, water was flowing, but a bit inconsistent with timing and even when we mentioned DH is not a tomato fan/has issues with them, several dishes had tomatoes (we were not warned and descriptions did not specify).  We were also not warned about the fact that the filet tartar is spicy (more below) which would have led to ordering another dish.  Overall, it was ok, but it wasn't spectacular.\\n\\nWine - we ordered 1 glass (split) for apps and 1 glass (split) for main courses, both choices were good, although neither were stellar.  As we aren't big drinkers, the amount was fine and the range ($9-11) was ok.\\n\\nFood - \\nWe started with filet mignon tartar - it comes with sriracha sauce, raw onions, capers, and a deconstructed salad type thing.  DH couldn't eat it (no warning about it being spicy and he has issues with that), so I had the whole thing, and it was quite a bit.  I wasn't a huge fan of it, but it was interesting in that I think it was my first time having that type of dish.  Only order if you like spicy (not super, but it has a kick), onions, and raw meat.  \\n\\nWe then moved on to the Foie Gras and the lobster cakes (like crab, but lobster, I guess for V-day).  The Foie Gras was good, tasty, well cooked, and a really good \\"salad\\" under it.  Not enough though, but when is there ever?  The lobster cakes were made with lots of red bell pepper cut up throughout - too much for us, as it was the overwhelming taste in the dish.  The sauce it came with was good, although too mild to compete and the lobster was completely lost.  \\n\\nFor mains, I ordered the Pork Saltimbocca and DH ordered the duck.  Mine was something you could find on any menu from 1970 - it was smothered in cheese and tomato sauce and not at all special or worth the price.  The portion was large enough for me to have lunch the next day.  DH's duck was good, although again a bit 1970's in preparation.  The skin was crispy, but not as perfect as we've had elsewhere and the sides were very old school.  \\n\\nFinally, we had dessert (gave them a chance here to redeem at the end).  I ordered the lemon \\"cheesecake\\" and had a choice of 5 sorbet options - I got blueberry.  They did warn me that there was no crust, but in truth it was more like a giant scoop of filling with a tiny scoop of sorbet on top and sauce and a few berries (it was served on a metal \\"shoe\\").  I think I would have enjoyed it more with another name - I'm all for desserts being recreated, but I've had better methods elsewhere.  DH had the bread pudding, also different (cranberries, apples, and croissants).  His was good, but again not outstanding.\\n\\nAtmosphere here was, as mentioned, a bit odd and old school.  It was also FREEZING where we sat and in the restrooms.  Don't wear that pretty dress, you'll shake all night.\\n\\nAll in all, I won't be returning anytime soon and for that, I give it 3 stars.

So when I saw Athan's while driving through Brookline, I screeched on my brakes, parked the car and with great anticipation, popped in. For a rather good-sized shop, I found the variety of offerings slim. So slim, in fact, that it was all too easy for me to find and make my initial selection in just a few moments. When trying a new bakery, I normally start with an almond pastry - primarily because I love almonds and can't be terribly disappointed, and I can move on (or away) from there without being stung too badly. Thus I bought one of their almond croissants. In a word - weak. The croissant itself was limp and lifeless; not crisp and flaky - and while the filling was ample, it wasn't as rich as it might be. The overall sensation was more of an almond cream donut than of a fine European filo pastry. \\n\\nWhile I might have hit Athan's on a bad day, given the limited assortment on offer and this lackluster first impression, I'm not likely to return.

It's got a cute, cozy, romantic vibe with great lighting, candles and roses on each table. I can see this place being loved by many couples. \\n\\nBut my goodness, the service was so slow. On a Friday night, with the place completely filled with customers, you would expect this place to have more than 3 servers (including 1 who speaks no English).

His drink didn't come out until way after I sat down.

I have never in my life thought \\"Italian food\\" when anyone asked me what I wanted to eat (I normally hate Italian food...) but now this is my favorite food/restaurant in Boston! The Alfredo is to-die-for (a spicy kick with chewy, thick noodles that are AMAZING, great portion size). I've also tried the baby eggplant appetizer (a huge shareable size), fried calamari (softer and less chewy but bigger than other calamari places- tastes fresh!), calamari & mussels (tiny bit spicy, topped with lots of mussels, thin angel hair pasta), and lamb shank (didn't like as much, the gnocchi is SUPER light and not chewy). \\n\\nMy only qualms are that the restaurant is tiny and loud, and it can be a long wait sometimes. The background music is itself loud but with such a small space, it is difficult to have a conversation. When filled, the chairs are also a tight space- I could barely pull out my chair and my legs could not be crossed without touching the person opposite me. I tried to make reservations a week in advance for a Friday night and couldn't get one-- so reserve early! We ended up showing up at 7pm on a Friday night for a party of two and waited until 9pm before being seated. It was a little frustrating as we put our names/cell numbers down, but we were not called or texted when our turn came up. When we had waited an hour and asked for updates, we were brushed off a little. We weren't trying to be pushy, but we wanted to know if we could walk further away or eat a snack nearby. Since we were not standing in front of the restaurant waiting, we found that others who were waiting outside got seated first, even if their names were on the list after us. My advice is to stick around. If there was a way to do automated text updates (you're X in line!) that would be really nice so we could know how far to stray.

I wouldn't have known about Tacos La Villa otherwise.  What is this place, though?  Is it a taco stand or is it a Quiznos?  Tacos La Villa occupies the former space of a Quiznos and the owners didn't bother to change much on the inside.  Things that are the same include the counters, the waste baskets, the pictures on the wall, and even all the light-up neon signs including a giant one that says \\"Mmm...

I've uploaded a picture of their menu with this review.\\n\\nThe tacos are $1 each.  I ordered the $4.99 taco plate, which comes with three tacos, beans, rice, and a drink.  They have fountain drinks and bottled/canned drinks including Jarritos (a Mexican soft drink).  I tried the steak carne asada, marinated pork al pastor, beef barbacoa res tacos.\\n\\nThe tortillas are tiny, but they put a lot of meat on them.  There's a small salsa bar with various salsas and vegetables that you can grab to accompany your meal.  There was freshly chopped onion and cilantro as well as cucumbers, carrots, and cauliflower.  Each of the tacos were equally good and I can't say I liked one over the other.  The meats were hearty and filling and the beans and rice were adequate.\\n\\nThe kitchen is out in the open so you can see the employees preparing everything.

The one complaint I have about this place is they're... rather unpredictable. I'd been trying, technically, for months: last time I was in Portland, I got here before they were supposed to close, but after they actually did close, which was super disappointing, so this time, when I made it to Portland just shy of 3 PM, I called in advance and asked to make sure they'd be open, and they promised they would be, so I hustled to get there as soon as possible, got there around 3:35 PM, and yep, they were closed. Apparently the owner knew they needed to close half an hour early that day but didn't tell the guy manning the place while he was out, so that was fun. So I was all prepared to write one of those 1-star reviews I absolutely hate writing, the one saying \\"I can't give a proper review because they are never open during their stated hours\\", but then the owner called me back later (the second time) to apologize, making sure I knew they'd definitely be open the next couple days as promised, and offering a complimentary shyamosa for the trouble - which was obviously completely unnecessary, we would absolutely have been back (and gotten a shyamosa!) regardless, but I am not complaining. \\n\\nAnyway, when we finally did make it here while they were open, the food absolutely lived up to the (quite large!) hype - it was all exceptionally good. Though I will also say, they still weren't quite done failing: we actually made it there only about half an hour after they opened, we got the very last lamb (we both wanted lamb, so we each had to get half lamb, half something else, because there was exactly one serving of lamb left), and not long after (while we were eating), we heard they also ran out of lemonade, too. So basically the moral of the story is, get here right when they open, because this review would have been much less glowing if they'd been out of lamb and lemonade, because their lamb was some of the best lamb I've had, and that lemonade was bonkers (tamarind mint ginger habanero lemonade sounds like way too many different things, but it is *good*!)\\n\\nThankfully, we did get some lamb - I would have been happier with all-lamb, but I will also say that their lentil fritters are probably the best vegan meat-replacement I've had in a while, too. Me and my wife shared a chicken shyamosa, and a full order of mee foon and flatbread (both half-lamb-half-lentil-fritters). We left feeling terrible about our choice, in that that was way too much food for two people (because of *course* we ate all of it, it was all too good). The flatbread in particular, I was expecting it to be one giant flatbread, but it was actually more like a roti (i.e. stuffed instead of with toppings), and it was *two* large rotis. I enjoyed it a lot anyway, but felt it was a little bit too lentil-y (I probably would have enjoyed that one particularly more if it had been all-lamb, since it's full of lentils either way). I'd definitely get the mee foon again, though obviously I'll have to try the mine frire first - if I lived nearby, I'd be back here all the time. But they do need to get better about being open and having sufficient food supplies, so I'd probably just always call first. :p"},{"name":"Nick's Deli & Restaurant","address":"750 Washington Ave","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"2 waffles, 2 coffees and an order of bacon was 25.00.

We looked on Yelp first and found a highly-rated place for breakfast nearby (I won't name names since we didn't actually try it) - walking in to that place we noticed a few things: nobody there (actually there was one couple eating non-breakfast food at the outdoor tables and the remnants of someone else's meal on another table nearby), a funky-spicy non-breakfasty smell, and a complete lack of attention or welcome as we entered.  My companion and I simultaneously got the \\"uh oh\\" vibe and decided to walk further.  \\n\\nThis place, just around the corner, was jammed and hoppin', and smelled like breakfast oughta.  Free coffee while you wait in the plaza for a table.  Seated in less time than advertised. \\n\\nVery good breakfast!  The biscuits live up to the minor hype, non-traditionally smooth on the outside but fluffy and mouthmelting inside. Portion sizes not insane but filling enough that we skipped lunch.  Loads of happy servers and customers.  Excellent service - our server offered us to-go refills on our beverages without prompting.  \\n \\nWhat's not to like?  Well, the chicken sausage patty was a bit of a disappointment, kind of oily and chewy (pork seems to be delegated to a far corner of the menu).  The price tag was a little high for breakfast, but nothing out of line for a good urban casual meal.  \\n\\nWe were happy with our \\"find\\" and ready to Yelp it up - having no idea this was a chain (and therefore automatically suspect in Yelpville).

So bad, in fact, that I just set up a Yelp account so that I could leave this review.\\n\\nSummary: Our party had an unbelievably negative experience at Bin 26, culminating in a remarkably poor customer service incident.\\n\\nOur waitress was exceptionally inattentive (most notably, informing us that the bottle of wine we'd ordered was not available after a lengthy delay and only once we inquired to its whereabouts). Poor service would perhaps be excusable, but there was bad food too: my entree was inedible. I never ever send dishes back to the kitchen, but my linguine with clams was so extremely sandy that I literally could not eat it. I understand that shellfish are difficult to clean and prepare, and that's an effort I'm usually unwilling to undertake in my own kitchen -- but it's something that (ostensibly) nice & expensive restaurants should be trusted to execute. And not only was the dish inedible, but the restaurant handled the situation very poorly. I notified the waitress that there was a problem with my meal (after she asked if it was because I \\"didn't like it,\\" which was fairly insulting...), I ordered a different pasta entree instead. Much to my surprise, the final bill included absolutely no deductions for the bad entree and subsequent delay to get a replacement. No reduced price on the entree, no comped dessert-- nothing.\\n\\nAgain, all of this might have been acceptable. But when we voiced a complaint (a mild complaint, really, considering how our meal had progressed), the manager was extraordinarily rude and dismissive. She accused me of overreacting about the quality of my entree, claiming that nobody else had sent theirs back that evening, and pointing out that clams are very hard to cook and sometimes sandy. I really couldn't believe that, after a meal that cost us each $75/person and was riddled with problems (of which I've only mentioned a couple here), I was scolded by the manager! Really truly unbelievable and a terrible experience.\\n\\nThe wine list here is impressive and some of the dishes were indeed quite good.

Sadly enough.\\n\\nBut in the end, you know that their expertise and priority is first and foremost the quality of the steak. As I've come to know and taste, all other dishes come second. In any case, it truly deserves four stars in overall dining experience."},{"name":"Carol's Place","address":"3421 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Typical breakfast joint, very casual, lots of old-timers, decent food, fairly quick service, probably wouldn't go back unless it was all there was and I was in the area but at the same time not saying its a bad place, just kind of a breakfast-dive..."},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Such a great atmosphere and beautiful desserts. I'd recommend this place if you like really sweet.

We both tried different cocktails that were delicious, and had a standard classic pizza, pepperoni, sausage/hamburger, mushroom, onion, pepper.  We loved it, even tho it is very different from what we were used to.  Loved the honey on the crust too!\\nOur waitress was friendly and helpful, too.\\nFive stars!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The reason you wait in line is because the staff are as fast as molasses. They would sell twice as much if they got out of first gear. There were 15 people in line before us and we waited almost an hour.\\n\\nThe sausage was excellent, it is comparable with sausage you can get in my car. I think the brisket is extremely overrated. It had way too much fat on it for my taste. The house made pickles were absolutely delicious. The potato salad is grossly overrated. The black bean southwest salad was much better. The pulled pork was very bland and the barbecue sauce that I used to try to spice it up was very watery.\\n\\nOverall, I do not think it is one of the best in Austin I have been waiting to eat there for years. And I can honestly say it was not worth the wait."},{"name":"Tamo Bistro & Bar","address":"1 Seaport Ln","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I used to love Tamo's menu, but the new version, which features small dishes from around the world really leaves me lacking. I want a hearty meal when it's cold and I don't feel like venturing outside the hotel after a long day at the office or a long flight.\\n\\nAlso, I don't feel like there are enough gluten free, dairy free options available. \\n\\nTheir staff is fantastic and they pour a mean cosmo, but the food choices need work. Lastly, the decor needs a re-do."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"44 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"We ordered pizza at midnight, and the tracker said it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. Very understandable considering there were a few events going on in Atlanta. Except that it was 2 am and still no pizza. The tracker said it was out for delivery at 1am and this Domino's is 5 minutes away from my hotel. I understand that they may have multiple deliveries, but there is no reason why my pizza wasn't there an hour later. I read an earlier review about this place in 2011, that was less than stellar. Well its 2018 and this Domino's still sucks. You may be very hungry and unable to get food from anywhere else but a pizza place, but save yourself some stress and don't order from this Domino's. (Also when my pizza did arrive, they told me I would be receiving a refund for waiting so long and for the fact that my food was cold, well its a week later and I have not received my refund)"},{"name":"White Castle","address":"6791 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the breakfast sandwiches when I'm on the go and need something quick to eat. \\nThis location has great customer service"},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I came here for lunch as our first stop in the north end, and we were nothing short of impressed.  Every day they have a lunch special where you can sample up to 5 of their chosen dishes for $7.95, which we elected to do.  I chose the lasagna, chicken Parmesan, and the eggplant Parmesan. My wife got those dishes as well as penne in pink basil sauce. Every dish was amazing, and an excellent deal at that.  This is definitely a place we will be bringing people to Boston!

However, the Hainanese chicken was a little dry, but combined with the spicy sauce it was okay - that being said, the rice was delicious. The pad thai was fine but nothing special in my opinion. The warm wet towels at the end of the meal was a nice touch, but not enough to compensate for the higher prices especially for Thai food."},{"name":"Euro Food Plus","address":"818 Bidwell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I love that when you walk in here, you immediately smell the lovely, cured olives - this is probably because the shop is pretty small and the olives are right by the door, but still! I thought the selection of cured meat and fish was quite good, and the bulk candy selection was reminiscent of that in Russia. The whole shop is packed to the gills, and I was especially impressed by the selection of packaged and especially fresh baked goods. There was bread from European Breads, among other places, and a variety of poppy seed rolls! yum."},{"name":"Marshall's","address":"1105 W 1st Ave","city":"Grandview Heights","stars":"3.5","text":"Good breakfast and morning drinks\\n\\n  Had breakfast at marshall's and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.
