Upon asking the servers who were attending are table they both stated that the bones we're part of the dish and to watch our for them.

How such a claim to be upscale and expensive seafood restaurant could serve fish with bones in it is beyond me as I have literally never been to another seafood place, again especially for this price point, that had bones in their food.

The cocktails stole the show though, and earned the 4th star.  They ranged from 8 -10 bucks, and I can't tell you how jealous I was of my friends cucumber collins.

At the heart of this new land is Beast's Castle. And inside of the castle is the Be Our Guest Restaurant. I'm rounding 2.5 stars up to 3 for my review.\\n\\nThe interior of the castle is clearly the main event. It's too bad the food is the undercard of the match. The menu is limited, but not in the same regards of a restaurant that does a few things exceptionally well. It appears to be limited so Disney can cook mass quantities of \\"high end\\" faux French cuisine.\\n\\nI ordered the saut√©ed shrimp and scallops and the wife ordered the grilled strip steak cooked medium rare. I found her steak way too salty and average at best. I found my shrimp, scallops, and vegetables baked in a pastry below average. The seafood tasted fresh, but the sauce had a heavy taste of having been made from Lipton french onion soup mix. I did not enjoy it.\\n\\nOn the positive side, they do serve alcohol at this restaurant, much to the duress of Magic Kingdom purists. They offer a decent sized wine list, as well as a limited, but adequate selection of French and Belgian beers. I still regret ordering a Chimay that I could order at most restaurants, instead of ordering a French Saison that I had not previously seen anywhere else. Also, the server was friendly and attentive, and the dining area held very true to the movie. \\n\\nOverall, I do not recommend this as a dining location due to the price and lack of quality in the food. If you want to check out the interior of the castle that badly, I would recommend doing the quick service lunch they offer. For a nice dinner that is closer to being worth the money while at the Magic Kingdom, just take the monorail to the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, or Contemporary resort and dine at one of their full service options."},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Went here with my four children and hubby.

The concept of this restaurant and the hype far outweighs the actual experience in my opinion, and I will not be going back any time soon.  \\n\\nThe castle/BOG atmosphere:  \\n\\nI was under the impression before we went that the Beast's castle was actually, well... a castle.  In actuality it's just a far off sculpture.  Inside BOG was okay.  Not as grandiose and beautiful as I expected, but obviously way better than any restaurant outside of WDW.  The stained glass piece by the entrance/exit is amazing, and some of the sculpture and statue work outside the restaurant is breath-taking.  Other than that though, this is not what I was expecting.  I ate in the room that had a statue of Belle and the Beast in the center, and the walls were lined with stills from the movie and other pictures from the Beast and Belle's \\"life together.\\"  Nothing to write home about there.  The other rooms looked better, so I probably should have chosen a seat in one of them.  However, the room I chose was the quietest and least crowded.  It was actually nearly empty, so that was nice.\\n\\nThe wait:  \\n\\nWe waited for at least an hour in line to get our food.  The line was extremely chaotic.  No one was corralling the guests and lots of people were sneakily skipping ahead in line as they had two queues going.  New Fantasyland had just opened about a week prior at this point, so maybe the line cutting has been worked out by now.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nThis was the worst part of my experience.  I ordered the Croque Monsieur sandwich, which is basically just a grilled ham and cheese.  It also came with french fries.  The food wasn't terrible, but it was very standard theme park food and did not make me want to return.  I left most of it on my plate.\\n\\nThe service:\\n\\nThis was by far my favorite part of BOG.  As I'm sure many of you have read/experienced, BOG offers touch screen ordering for lunch.  After you order, you are given a rose that you take to your table, and then you simply wait for the servers to bring your food.  I had a very long wait for what I consider fast food, but I was still blown away by this technology so I didn't really mind.\\n\\nOverall, I think BOG needs some tweaking.  I know they've just released some price increases, which is not the tweaking I'm talking about.  I might return again in a few years, but for now I'll stick with Cosmic Ray's or Columbia Harbor House if I need a quick bite."},{"name":"Neverland Tea Salon","address":"3066 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I reeeeaalllyyy wanted to (and tried) to love this place, but it was a straight downhill trajectory after the initial high of entering a super adorable tea room.\\n\\nThe decor here is a wonderful mixture of \\"Neverland\\" meets \\"Alice in Wonderland - serious kudos to the owner/decorator. Hopes were high...and then my friends and I were seated at the most uncomfortable table for 3.

Definitely ask to be seated at one of the \\"proper\\" tables if there's more than 2 of you. \\n\\nWe all ordered the high tea with a few substitutions, which our first server happily accommodated. Yay...things were getting back on track! The tea came and it was lovely, then the food came and it was less lovely. We all found the food really hit or miss. I normally love cucumber sandwiches, but could barely eat these as the bread was so soggy. There was also this weird seasonal item which was a sort of spiced cracker with apple sauce on it. However, the croissant sandwiches were really good and I also liked the scones. \\n\\nNow what tipped this into two-star territory was the gradual deterioration of service over the course of our tea service. Afternoon tea is meant to be a leisurely experience, and about an hour into our reservation we started to feel very \\"rushed\\" by our servers. I could understand if there were people waiting for tables (there wasn't), or if they had another reservation (a placard on the table clearly indicated the next party wasn't due for another 2+ hours)...as neither was the case the servers constant - every 5 to 10 minute - inquiry if we were done or would like to pack up our remaining food started to get extremely irritating. At one point after telling one of the girls that \\"we're still working at it\\" for the 3rd time in 20 minutes...she just stood there for an uncomfortably long time staring at us...when she finally left we all seriously wondered if she was on drugs or incredibly socially awkward.

It actually comes in the exact shape and size as the Raspberry Rosemary Buttermilk donut, so I feel as though the same batch used for those donuts were used for the Old-Fashioned, but I wouldn't think that would be an issue since I liked this donut too. The consistency for the buttermilk on this donut also had that same creaminess for the Rosemary as well and I really appreciate that.

It's so simple, yet it melted in my mouth so effortlessly. Sorry, kind of went overboard with this one, but dark chocolate is like a special ingredient to me that should always be used properly and I feel as though it was in this case. Although the donut was big, it wasn't hard at all in eating. It was a very pleasant experience. It has a slightly creamy texture, but I think that's what they wanted out of this donut.

Even the best Chinese places overcook it, but Java Noodles always knocks it out of the park and delivers tender sesame goodness. I can't say enough good things about it. On the other hand, their Lo Mein and Pad Thai could really use some work. I've had both on more than one occasion, and each time, I've been deeply disappointed. I mean, I shouldn't have to ramble through my spice cabinet or think about cooking the barely-chopped vegetables just so I can eat the dish as it was intended. \\n\\nI think the main thing that keeps me coming back, aside from my wanton laziness, is the service. I've never had a bad experience with them, and that's saying a lot, considering that good, friendly service can be hard to find in Austin.

It's like trying to explain a joke...if people don't get what you're doing by the decor and the menu it's not their fault for being obtuse.  It means that your decor and menu are poorly designed.\\n\\nI did like the oysters, so I'll give them 2 1/2 stars.

Back in late January of this year, we had visited WDW and this portion of Epcot was going through heavy renovation. We were pleasantly surprised to have a table for two in less than 10 minutes, especially after the rush with all the families with little kids came rushing through the door. I ordered the Tiramisu cocktail, which was to die for- while my husband had an Italian Margarita. We also ordered the minestrone soup and mixed green salad thinking that our pizza may be a little small for a very much wanted dinner- we were so wrong! Their fluffy yet doughy pizza was ridiculously good- we had their carciofi pizza which had artichoke hearts, white sauce, fontina, mozzarella and truffle oil. Amazing. A very simple, yet elegant delight. If anything I'm giving them a four out of five stars because the acoustics for the restaurant were not built properly therefore accentuating every time the crew sang for someone's birthday, and in WDW, this was every five minutes."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Let's start with the restaurant first.

In all fairness, I did order the end cut, but did not expect it to be that dry.  It was also missing all the flavor you would expect from an end cut.  This would not stop me from coming due to the fact that chart house in general alway serves an above average experience.

But lo and behold, I have and it is phenomenal!\\n\\nI've wanted to try this place for awhile now.  I mean, you know that any gas station with a legit looking sign for Mexican food must be good, right?  So last night I was walking home and knew I didn't have dinner at home.  Walking down Cambridge St, I remembered this little Mexican joint with the advertisement for food in the gas station.  Plus, a friend had told me it's pretty authentic.\\n\\nOh yes, it was.  I walked in and the lady, who I assume owned the food establishment, greeted me with her signature \\"hello friend.\\"  Already so touching.  Or as touching as one can be in a gas station convenience store.  I couldn't decide and instead of being snarky with me or giving me a dirty look, she said not a problem, and let me take my time.  I finally decided on the mole poblano chicken burrito.\\n\\nOh heaven.  They made it spicy for me and I have to say this is one of the most perfect spiciness I have tried.  Sometimes establishments make food spicy for the sake of being spicy.  Not Villa Mexico.  They made it spicy with loads of flavor.  I also asked if they had lemonade.  They didn't so instead she made me a cucumber lime fresca, which really sounds like it should go on one's face before bed time to exfoliate, but it actually was pretty good.\\n\\nSome people may dock this place a star or two for atmosphere, but really, it's not like you don't know you're walking into a gas station convenience store, so ignore the bottles of car lube next to you.

Upon a brief chat with our waitress, we found out that La Scala has been under new ownership since August 2009. \\n\\nA few Yelpers have mentioned that the interior seemed dated. I didn't think it seemed dated-- I rather liked the artwork.

Meanwhile, the table next to us had just sat down, had drinks brought to them and had ordered their appetizers. They seemed to have a very nice waiter. Janet finally came over and took our drink order and said she would bring us some bread. Our drinks and bread then took another 20 minutes.

We had had all of our drinks and finished the bread on the table. We were just about ready to stand up and leave as we hadn't even seen her walk by us. She kept disappearing in to the kitchen. When she finally came over she started with a joking \\"So are you starving yet?\\". We politely said yes and ordered. Thankfully, the food came fast and the man who brought the food out was very very nice. We ate for about 20 minutes meanwhile our waitress had not come to ask how we were doing or to refill our drinks once.

I'd forgotten it was vegetarian, but luckily my mom was ok with it!\\n\\nWe got a mixed fry basket to start with. The fries were delicious with the aioli sauce! The yuca fries were also very well done. The veggie noodles mostly just tasted liked fried since the the noodles were so thin. The ketchup that came with the basket was very thin and tasted like vinegar which I did not like at all. We each got burgers. I got the paleo, mom got the citizen, and  my sister got the assam. Personally the citizen was my favorite. It had a great texture and the avocado ranch was yummy. The paleo was also really good, you could really taste the sweet potato and mushroom. I did not like the assam BUT that is only because I don't like Indian food. My mom and sister both do and loved the burger!\\n\\nOverall, great experience. Tasty food and attentive wait staff.

Dreams do come true. I first heard about Wagamamas from watching one of my favorite Youtubers who live in the UK. They always talk about this restaurant and how good it is, that when I was planning a trip to Boston and looking up places to eat... And then BAM! Wagamamas popped up on the map, I just knew I had to go, since it's the only location here in America!\\n\\nThis restaurant is pretty big, they have booths for smaller parties and loooong ass tables for larger ones. The bathrooms are nice and clean. And can't forget the service, it was definitely on point! From the hostess to our waiter, everyone was so pleasant and nice (what every wait staff should be like in my opinion). Towards the end of our meal the manager came up to us and greeted us, asking how our meal was and if everything was good. Couldn't ask for better service!\\n\\nIf you check into yelp you can order one free side (appetizer). I got the lollipop shrimp kushiyaki and my friend ordered the pork belly + panko apple hirata steamed bun. Both were tasty, but I have to say my friend made the better choice (darn him and his love for anything in a steamed bun!)\\n\\nFor thee entree I got the kare lomen with chicken. If I had to describe it in my own words it's like eating a mixture of curry and ramen together. The soup was a mix of coconut milk, chili, and lemon grass, with ramen noodles, topped with bean sprouts, cilantro, and of course the chicken. When I ordered this dish I felt like I was sorta stepping out of my comfort zone.. Which is good and bad, but I still wish I ordered the pork ramen (my go to in any Japanese restaurant that serves ramen hehe). Sooo.. That's probably the reason I only gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. The dish was good, just not my favorite. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the wagamama ramen, which was huge and filling. I'm pretty sure I know what caught his eye to order it too, it has grilled chicken, barbecued pork, and shrimp. Hey, if you can't just choose one, get all three! \\n\\nThe food came out fast, mind you it was the beginning of lunch rush hour and the restaurant wasn't fully packed yet. Also, this place apparently sells really yummy freshly made juices, we never got to try it, but maybe next time!\\n\\nThis is definitely the type of restaurant you need to keep coming back to in order to try all their food since they have so many options.

Sure, you can have \\"fake food\\" - so if you want a meat eater's meal made with vegan components, that's possible.

Yikes, there are so many great recipes that are vegan from the outset that would be awesome here. \\n\\nAs for the food preparation: everyone's fries were soggy, and no one in our party enjoyed their burgers very much.

This post is not about food: their food is delicious. This post is not about the employees: they are dedicated and professional. This post is about the ownership who refuses to put in a system that allows people who have paid to get a table. The system at Zyka is: if there's an open table, you take it, whether you have ordered or not. Tonight we truly felt the effect of this ineffective system as my wife and I drove one hour to Zyka and ordered around 8pm, got our receipt and waited for an open table. The first open table we found, we went toward it, only to be beaten to it by a family who had not even ordered yet. We made this a point, but they decided to keep the table having not yet ordered. We found a second table, but another couple took that table before ordering. We found a third table where a couple was finishing up, and we asked them if we can get next. They said they were still eating (they were not, but that's okay). We then got our food. So there we are, no table to sit at, and dishes on a tray. We stooped low enough to go back to the second table to ask if we can share the table with them (there were two of them, two of us, four chairs, you do the math). They said no. We subsequently went to the counter to get our food packed up, drove an hour home, and now are reheating this food at 9:30pm. Set aside the rudeness of three parties.

Looking for Thai around Buda this restaurant popped up and our community really likes it. Well, I loved it.\\n\\nI arrived alone and was quickly seated. The host/waiter was quite, but efficient and when eating alone that was perfect. Water was good and he kept it full. I'm a simple person and that simple execution always impresses me. It's amazing how it is a simple sign of a waiter who abandons you.\\n\\nI started off with the shrimp roll appetizer. Wow, that thing looked amazing. I wasn't here to look at food, but to eat it. That experience was amazing as well. It tasted fresh, crunchy, and a great mix of ingredients. The \\"sauce\\" that came with it was a tart/sweet complement and I gave this high marks. Really wanted to try the pot-stickers, but this didn't make me disappointed. \\n\\nFor the main meal I went with the pad cashew. I was wanting some sort of noodle but couldn't tell from the menu. It came with a side of rice that I didn't know where to put as the plate was GINORMOUS and filled to the rim with a heap of fresh veggies, perfect chicken, crunchy cashews and just a lovely treat to the tongue. It was really big enough to share. But I was a winner tonight - I could gorge on it alone. Reflecting on things, the wise choice would have been to bring half of it home for a future meal. Fortunately, no one ever accused me of making smart choices in life.\\n\\nThe only thing that almost did me in was the table. If the food wasn't so wonderful, we would be a 4 star max. But the food was that good and I quit freaking out. The table had that shellacking of stickiness. Like someone took a well used rag out of a bin of fetid water that had something sticky in it. Instead of cleaning the table, they coated it with stickiness. I couldn't put my hands on the table and avoided placing anything on it other than my forearms that were safely within my jacket. Every time I lifted my arms it was tugged back by the sticky tension. Pretty gross. I hope this place does a better job of using cleaner or at least clean water when bussing the table. \\n\\nPro tip: Take out is a wonderful choice.

We live 5.6 miles from the store on 183 (right by the I-Fly) and we were hoping to have the pizza delivered.  The website specifically says that if we get a message that they don't deliver to our home we should call them and ask if they actually deliver to our area. We called and they said they didn't deliver. Since we hadn't tried the pizza before I decided I would drive and get it. Round trip was 30 minutes. The only way it would be worth it to drive and get this pizza again would be if it is the best pizza in the world. It isn't. Don't get me wrong, it is very very good. But its not SO much better than Saccone's on Hwy 620 (that delivers to us) that it's worth 30 minutes in the car. Also, there isn't a lot of parking in their lot, so if you drove to pick up a pie and there was no parking in the lot, I guess you have to drive around and come back because you can't park on 183. \\n\\nSo if they don't offer delivery in the future we probably won't get this pie again.\\n\\nI asked the employees what delivery service they use and they replied that they don't, they just have a guy who works for them who delivers. That may work in East Austin where it's easy to walk to places and there is plenty of parking, but in NW Austin, they need to use a service. I suggested that they use Uber Eats. Of course, the employees probably have no control over that aspect of the business, but I hope they pass the suggestion along to management.\\n\\nIn any case, the pizza was thin and crispy and the sauce was great. So were the toppings. We got 1/2 sausage and mushroom and 1/2 pepperoni and both were great.

I knew I had to make a stop  there at some point as burgers are my fave!\\n\\nI have been trying to eat healthy, especially on work trips/during the week, so I knew I wanted a burger with no cheese or bun. Luckily there is a healthy option that consists of a patty with lettuce and balsamic, but I just opted for a regular burger with no cheese and no bun.

It's literally just regular fries and sweet potato fries. As much as I'd love to have those, that's kind of a weekend/special meal for me. I noticed there was a yogurt parfait on the breakfast menu so I asked if that could be my side and I was told no because it wasn't breakfast. So kinda bummed about that. They should offer a healthier side option like fruit or some type of veggies.\\n\\nThey tell you to-go wait is 14 mins and man do they have it down to a science.

It is completely a narcissistic tendency.  I don't want folks to show up and create a longer wait than usual.  However, I just totally need to update my review of Fino.  It's hard to believe it's been almost 5 years since I reviewed them.  Since then some truly special and awesome things have transpired.  \\n\\nA bump in a star is justified by one simple act of kindness by the  manager.  I was diagnosed with a brain tumor a couple of years back.  I got the news on a thursday and surgery was scheduled on the following monday.  It was a pretty big deal.  Suzie and I really didn't know what  to expect, and it was certainly something that life can throw you up the ultimate curve ball.. no-one is expected to hit it and it's your third strike....  We were basically still in shock on friday, after spending most of thursday weeping and wondering if my miss spent youth had created this issue for me.  In my usual fashion, I was ignoring the obvious and making plans for death basically.  Suzie was petrified and had just returned to town from her fathers 90th birthday party. She had left me with a headache to return to my tumor.  I wanted to to have a relaxed dinner, somewhere where it would be intimate and not one of our frequent stops, since we really were in no mood to celebrate.  Fino, is just down the street from my office and since I was in my office, being all diligent and crap, we wandered down to Fino.  \\n\\nThe location happened to be where I took my now bride for our first afternoon date when it was Granite Hill Cafe.  Seemed like we had come full circle.  We grabbed one of the little two tops in the main dining area and previewed the menu.  Always such wonderful options available.  Fried Anchovy Stuffed Olives, yup get them.  Hummus if it's on the menu, get it.  Their daily specials are usually something you may not have heard of, so get that as well.  The lamb burgers are sublime and some of the best calamari with an amazing pepper sauce which I always forget the name of.  We got our entrees and some great wine and adverted eye contact since that just brought tears and enjoyed our meals.  I ordered some Champagne, why the heck not, and started talking to Suzie about all the things I have in place for her just in case.  I was all about being properly prepared.  We eventually finished and it was time to go.  Our waitress, who happened to be fantastic came over and I asked her to tab us out.  She told us the tab was taken care of...\\n\\nWhat the...  She wished me the best and told us again, the tab had been taken care of.  I asked for the manager to come over, that we didn't expect any special treatment.  He came over and just simply said, we wish you the best on Monday, get well and come back and celebrate with us... Suzie and I were just dumbfounded... I threw a couple of twenty's on the table for our waitress and we left.  Touched and just gobsmacked.  Apparently our waitress had overheard our conversation and related it to the management.  Yes, I had been coming into Fino for awhile and perhaps they recognized us, but nonetheless, completely unnecessary, but graciously accepted.\\n\\nThis is one of the many reasons why Fino has such a place in my heart.  The food has consistently been exceptional and the bar.. well snort down a few Indian Paint Brushes with KK or Holly and it becomes a high end PARTY.  The care and attention which the bartenders take in making your drink is phenomenal.  Great care and a multitude of different ingredients will make you a unique drink, not found anywhere in Austin.

With zero personality they give us a table, but we could not sit down yet because our whole party wasn't there and we couldn't just sit at the table and order drinks (which would have made more money for the server). So we walk by our empty table to the bar where we order four drinks (over priced). Bartender lacked personality just like the front desk. He served our drinks without saying a word. I watched him make my drink which he only filled 3/4 of the way, topped it with some water and more ice!!!! \\n\\nOnce seating, our waitress made up for the lack of personality we had thus far. Orders wings, they came out in 5 minutes (maybe they microwaved them?!?!) they were ok. I ordered a burger. Burger came to the table and I go to bite into a French fri and it was cold and soggy. Burger was supposed to come with thousand island dressing, there was a small dot about the size of a nickel. The burger was ordered medium rare, it came out medium well. The cheese must have been paper thin to begin with cause it looked painted on and the burger was over salted. 3 other people in my party had burgers and they fries were cold as well and burgers were ok'ish.

Disney needs to update the material to a much more pleasing performance and throw in one-liners that are actually funny. I feel bad for saying this because the actors work hard. ..Disney is always revising (or getting rid of) stuff in the theme parks that sometimes they shouldn't (Ahem..The Great Movie Ride and Maelstrom), so why can't they redo the hoop dee-- something that really does need a total transformation.\\n\\n..As of now it's certainly not worth 2 dining credits, or worse paying all that money out of pocket.

The \\"No\\"-Jito was tasty but I didn't drink it all, primarily because I was too busy scarfing down all five of my plates. That's not a negative about the drink, but more of a testament to how good the food was. Also, I had a Coke Zero on the side because my meal plan allowed for a specialty drink and a soda, and that clashed a little less with the many flavors I was consuming.\\n\\nFood: all great, and LOTS of it. I had ribs during my two previous meals at Disney and the short ribs at Boma far exceeded the expectations I had from my prior rib-eating experience. Seriously fall off the bone good - and I found that was also the case with the chicken, which was tender and so easy to eat, despite being bone-in.\\n\\nThe sides were awesome, too, with an eclectic mixture of African sides and sauces. I forgot what it was called, but an egg casserole made with ground beef and lamb was a highlight, and I went back for seconds on that one. The mashed sweet potatoes were bomb, the BBQ, mustard, various chutneys, and African \\"pesto\\" was all great, and the options for more kid friendly foods like chicken breast nuggets, macaroni and cheese, and spaghetti and meatballs were a good touch, even if I didn't eat those.\\n\\nDesserts are abundant and I made a mini plate to sample most of them. Highlights were the cobbler with a vanilla bean drizzle that could be added and the Oreo cheesecake, but everything was good on that end, too.\\n\\nOnly downside: you'll eat until your insides hurt.

I like the concept, I mean I am sure not many people on here have been to Brazil. Guess what? I have, and over there it is not just about the over the top churrascaria. Sure they have the nicest and best in the world in Sao Paulo and Rio, but they also have many places that are just everyday Churrascarias. These places are like $10-15 and serve good food at fair prices. So that is the common low end that I know. As a point of reference I have also dined at Porcao and Marius (Brazil), Porcao and Platforma (NYC), and Rafain and Texas De in Dallas. \\n\\nRed and Green is for sure a step above these common joints in Brazil, but it for sure is not the same experiences as a Fogo or Texas De. That is exactly what i like about it though. It is like $17.99 for lunch and $29.99 for dinner. So nothing that breaks the bank, plus as many have mentioned they do have various kinds of discounts from time to time. \\n\\nThe salad bar is OK, I did like that they had hearts of palm. The sweet breads are average but certainly not bad. The meats are good, especially some of them. In particular I liked the fillet, flank, and Beef Ribs. At a place like this don't be afraid to ask for your meat the way you want it cooked, medium rare, etc. Also do not be afraid to ask for meat with less salt. Those are two things I always do, especially at joints like this. \\n\\nI did not drink this night, but I did note the wine list which is very affordable, even if lacking many better options. \\n\\nI was surprised at the poor reviews for service as I thought the service was just fine, even quite good.

When we walk in, we ask for a table for 3 and the waitress seems really confused and then proceeds to the back to ask someone if it is okay. We are then told by another waitress who simply just points to a location and says go ahead and sit there.

Please keep in mind, that there are about 3 tables that are free and the restaurant is a little crowded, but not to the point where it is hectic. I understand that it is a holiday and there also might be reservations, but when there are 3 free tables available, you should be able to find somewhere for us to sit besides the floor. So after all this, I decided that it would probably be best if we order take out. We go ahead and make our order and after we have paid, the waitress tells us that it is going to take 1 hour!! So by this time we have already paid and decide just to come back in an hour for our food. An hour later, we return to pick up our food and the waitress simply just gives us our food with No thank you or an apology for the long wait.

Located on Orange near SODO, Brick & Fire is a pizza restaurant that always provides unique pizzas that are well-made and very tasty and filling. When you arrive at the location, you walk in to a small hostess stand and can see the entire kitchen, which is fun. They also have lots of interesting photos on the wall, but not so interesting as to distract from the meal like can occur at trendier places. The hostess will then sit you down and bring you out the gigantic menu with lots of options, including a variety of beers and wines. All of the food options are great, but I will warn that, due to being a higher level pizza joint, the items are a little pricey. \\n\\nOn our most recent trip, we decided to get personal size pizzas so that we could try the Hawaiian and the Duck Confit. We had previously tried the Van Gogh and the Girl and Fig (my favorite). Just like with our previous pizzas, these pizzas came out in about 15-25 minutes and were very #amazing. This location often includes a unique topping on each pizza (as well as Gorgonzola cheese on some options-YUM!), so we encountered macadamia nuts on the Hawaiian and pears on the Duck. Both were great choices that enhanced all of the other pizza flavors. After having a couple of bites, we usually (including this time) box up the rest because it is so filling and headed out. \\n\\nOverall, Brick & Fire provides one of the most amazing and unique pizza experiences in Orlando.

During our first visit a few years ago, we got in line, the cast members ushered us through the door, we went to a kiosk to order our meals, we found a table in the west wing, and our food was delivered a short time later.  During last week's visit, it was a far less efficient experience.  The queue outside the castle was a mess.  We had reservations, but I'm not sure this helped us.  A cast member eventually wrote the names of parties with reservations on a notepad and called us into the castle and out of the hot Florida sun one group at a time.  Once we made it to the \\"inside line,\\" the wait was still 20-30 minutes.  I have a feeling that the folks at Be Our Guest, in the spirit of Disney accommodation, were allowing a large number of groups without reservations to pop in for lunch.  While an admirable gesture to make all guests' experiences as magical as possible, it inhibits the schedules of the guests who were smart enough to plan ahead.  Once we arrived at the kiosks, we discovered half of them were either not working or shut down; probably the latter as they were wrapping up the lunch crowd and getting ready for dinner by the time we finished.\\n\\nNonetheless, we will probably return to Be Our Guest.

The hibachi smelled good but I did not try it.  I won't lie....the best thing there was their chicken nuggets.

We ordered our usual \\"go-to\\" the cold noodle which was pretty good, a spicy mapo tofu dish which was also decent. The third dish we got was the spicy chicken in casserole, which was a total mistake! The meat was over cooked and was so tough to eat - we brought this up to the manager lady and she offered to have it re-cooked. However the re-cooked dish was still not very good and no one followed up with us afterwards. In the end we just didn't want to bother anymore. When we were paying for our meal (at full price), I asked the waitress how was the dish cooked at the first place, she had no idea at all and said only the cook would know....I would think that whoever is working at a restaurant would at least have some idea regarding their menu and food prep process. \\n\\nIt was a very disappointing experience overall and it probably would take a long time for us to go back for another try at this place."},{"name":"Whataburger","address":"3400 W Slaughter Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I wanted a fish sandwich like I got at the whataburger in San Marcos.

Let's be honest, I'm the kinda guy that'll be seen in public munching on raw carrot and celery sticks as desserts, however, trying both the orange zest doughnut and the blueberry bourbon donuts made me reconsider my eating habits. The blueberry bourbon doughnut had a seductive velvety glaze and tasted absolutely sublime without being overly sweet. The orange donut had a crunchy outer texture (lots of oil...I'm sure) but a very soft and chewy doughy inside and covered with a mouthwatering and tingling orange zest. The staff who worked there was the kindest and nicest person in the entire world and offered to bring all sorts of cutlery, plates, napkins and bags due to my silly nature not to engulf the donuts in a few bites.\\n\\nThe prices may be three times as much as voodoo donut, but why waste money and calories on the earthly delights when you can try something heavenly?\\n\\nFood: 4 stars\\nService: 5 stars\\nPrice: 3 stars"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"3325 SE Division St, Ste 1","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is not just top notch, it's NEXT LEVEL!!!\\n\\nThese donuts are so far into the next level I don't know if I can describe them.\\n\\nTheir obviously hand-made frosting is the tastiest and most specifically \\"Chocolate\\" tasting frosting I've ever had. HANDS DOWN!!! It is what I imagine (no longer have to) the perfect and true Chocolate tastes like. Sweet, a pinch of salted butter somewhere in the mix, and a richness that isn't at all overpowering, but slides over that palate and down your throat (yes, I said that) to what is soon to be a happy and satisfied stomach.\\nThe Bri√≥che dough is somehow handcrafted a little lighter and fluffier than a Bri√≥che bread dough. It is THE.......PERFECT.......DOUGH! The perfect Donut dough. It is light and fluffy with a slightly sweet yet \\"pure\\" taste. Like it wasn't touched by anything ever and just magically formed into dough one day and a donut the next. It pairs so well with the frosting that it's no wonder this is their hands down customer favorite. And don't even get me started on how the dried (maybe roasted or toasted) Almond bits added the the overall taste combination. It takes a Next Level, Upper Echelon Donut and throws It a whole other Level up the scale. (Is there such a pace?)\\n\\nThe \\"O.G.\\" is the somewhat standard glazed donut but with added flavors and a spice or two. Truthfully, it was a solidly good donut. And it could compete with most other donuts in any other craft-made donut shop.\\n\\nWe also tried the Maple Bacon with a light Maple glaze and large Bacon crumbles on top. This is/was a great donut! Subtle flavors within the Maple that my under-trained palate couldn't make out, but they made the frosting glaze different than other Maples. Lighter but tastier. I would like to see more Bacon on the donut. I'm an OVER-Lover of Bacon though. You could probably serve it up on a plate made of Bacon and I'd be happy. In all seriousness I do think the donut could use about 30% more Bacon.\\n\\nThese were in order a solidly good donut and a great donut (the O.G. & the Maple Bacon), but the Chocolate Bri√≥che with Almonds was so far out of the realm of a Connoisseur's donut that I'm still trying to make up a word to describe it.\\n\\nAnd the Staff???

And even last night, my wife liked her meal -- the Faroe Island salmon with couscous, almond, green olives and oranges.\\n\\nI ordered one of the specials, which was described as short beef ribs. What I got was something that tasted like pot roast, and that was surrounded by enormous globules of fat that I had to scrape off and put to one side -- smothered in some sort of sauce designed, I imagine, to cover up more than to enhance. I'm not sure why I didn't send it back. It was pretty awful. I had broccoli rabe as the vegetable, and that was quite good.\\n\\nWe got arancini as an appetizer, and that was excellent. Also arriving was stale bread with plain olive oil. We ordered some sort of toffee pudding thing for dessert, and it was dry except for the sauce that accompanied it.\\n\\nI would still give the 62 three stars except that the prices are way too high.

Why ruin my subsequent flavorful and delicious dinner at another vegan spot by settling for what would likely be a sub-par dessert? \\n\\nThat being said, I hope they figure it out.

Also, when we got to the restaurant there were no parking spots in the front or back but we called and they said we could park across the street. The service was good and the waitress was well informed of the menu - which helped us make our decisions. All of the food was wonderful and we can't wait to go back!

For my beef noodle it was ok, however I noticed there were less noodles and contents in the bowl this time round. The fried chicken leg is good and had great flavour. \\n\\nHere's the problem - My partners order did not live up to standard for the hot and spicy the contents in the soup. This order lacked ingredients for some reason, and it was way better that before. Also the vermicelli stir fry was so oily that there was a pool of oil in the middle of the dish. We pointed this to the waitress and she had taken note and mentioned that she will speak to the chef.\\n\\nService wise they managed to get all or orders in and the food was quick, tea and napkins were always provided.\\n\\nFood wise the quality and the standard is going down as I think the quality is going downhill as I believe they had changed their chefs - Hence the two stars!"},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down, the best breakfast taco in the city!

The little white plastic signs next to samples contain a short description of the item. It seems like a reasonable, understandable system... What I'm so angry about is the $15.00 I just wasted on 4 donuts that I'll never finish.

I've had Mexican Hot Chocolate, which had the same very bitter-sweet ganache topping as the ones I purchased today. At first bite, the chocolate almond was spongy chocolate goo deliciousness...

The menu has changed several times since the restaurant opened in Summer 2014. Each time, it's usually been a minor change. A couple examples of dishes that have come and gone include the caul fat roll and pig intestines. The food here remains excellent. As such, you can consider this update a direct supplement to my previous review below.\\n\\nAdditional items I've tried include:\\n\\nSteamed pork belly\\nCuttlefish\\nBeef Tongue Bao\\nClear Broth Beef Noodle Soup with Tendon\\nBraised Oxtail Rice Plate\\n\\nThe steamed pork belly, cuttlefish, and clear broth noodle soup were added to the menu about 2-3 months after the restaurant opened.\\n\\nThe steamed pork belly is superb. Delicate slices of steamed pork belly are topped with a special brown sauce and chopped scallions. They surround a mound of white rice and are served with a small side of green baby bok choy. The pork belly slices are soft and succulent, very tasty, and surprisingly not greasy. Simply a delectable dish.\\n\\nThe cuttlefish is okay. It's sort of a bland dish. The white cuttlefish meat is sliced into bite-size pieces and garnished with a bit of chopped scallion. It's served with a mildly spicy red chili dipping sauce. The subtle flavoring, smooth texture, and somewhat rubbery consistency of the cuttlefish aren't unexpected. Cuttlefish is in the same family as squid and octopuses and tastes roughly the same too.\\n\\nLike the other bao sandwiches, the Beef Tongue Bao is terrific. The tongue is slow-braised and is served with a dark chili hoisin sauce with thinly sliced scallion. The tongue isn't as chewy as I initially assumed. It's slippery and fatty and actually more along the lines of pork belly. I think I prefer the Pork Belly Bao and Dirty Bird Bao slightly over the Beef Tongue Bao. However, you can't go wrong with any of them. They're all good.\\n\\nThe Clear Broth Beef Noodle Soup with Tendon is a nice contrast to the \\"regular\\" brown-colored broth Beef Noodle Soup. The clear broth noodle soup actually looks quite similar to a bowl of Vietnamese pho upon first glance. Flat white noodles, cooked pieces of beef, bok choy, and chopped scallion are the ingredients. This is a clean, pleasant, mildly flavored soup. The other beef noodle soup on the menu has more intense flavors and I think most people would prefer it for that reason. The clear broth noodle soup is reminiscent of Korean tangs (soups) such as seolleongtang (made from ox bones) with its tame, milky, off-white broth. Don't sleep on this one. It's refreshing.\\n\\nThe Braised Oxtail Rice Plate is delectable, though the actual portion of oxtail is small. If sharing this \\"large plate,\\" order one for every 3-4 people. An order consists of bone-in, slow-cooked oxtail with chunks of potato, bok choy, and a mound of white rice. The oxtail is tender and savory. The meat forks apart easily and has a hearty, beefy taste. Very satisfying.\\n\\nPlease refer to my original review below for my general thoughts and extra information on Ah-Ma's (e.g. seating, location, service) as well as other dish details and recommendations. I still suggest the frog legs, pig ears, Dirty Bird Bao, \\"salt & pepper chicken\\" (Taiwanese chicken nuggets), Taiwanese sausage, and Lu Rou Fan rice bowl.

I have not geeked out over a restaurant - perhaps ever before. Not like this! \\n        AMBIANCE - Welcoming, and upscale without being the least bit stuffy. I love that I could seat myself - I prefer choosing my own table. Light and airy, with outside seating as well. \\n        FOOD - The degree of attention to detail is extraordinary. My toast was crisp, and remained so through the last bite. I ordered the Vegan Citizens' Breakfast (I eat eggs, but vegan fare is one of my tests for a place). Two notes: 1) This was the best tofu scramble I have enjoyed in my life, including my own homemade-and I'm a good cook 2) I did not use even a drop of the hot sauce for which I had asked as I do routinely - it was that good! \\n        SERVICE - My check said that my server was Jocelyn. Huh. I have no clue who Jocelyn is, because the service was superb. Seamless. None of this, \\"I'll tell your server,\\" or someone handling beverages only, with someone else running the food. My every need was anticipated and met at the moment before I thought of it. No fewer than four different folks attended to me (or was it five?). \\n          LOCATION - Very easy to find, if you know what you're looking for: it's on the East Side of Burnet Road in the Eye Physicians of Austin building with Russell Korman Jewelers. Citizens Eatery is on the south side of the building. 5011 Burnet Road. \\n        DETAILS - Great weekday happy hour, which even includes appetizers and burgers at 25% off. Full bar with specialty cocktails, and everything possible is locally sourced. \\n        MORE DETAILS - I chatted up the staff, who claim that Citizens Eatery is a GREAT place to work. That makes sense to me; I saw the owner Mike restocking salad plates, then soup cups. If you have EVER worked in hospitality, you know that is unique. I would write still more, but I really do have to do my homework now. \\n        CONCLUSION - Why would you stand on line for 20-50 minutes for a Sunday brunch somewhere else when you could come here for better food, better service, a nicer setting and a smaller check?

Yeah, I snoozed, and I lost.  \\n\\nAt Ron Tom's you will also find a great collection of board games that are perfect in the winter when you score one of the coaches located close to the fire.  What really makes Ron Tom's stand out is their excellent outdoor area, hidden behind the building, complete with a ping pong table.  Next to Amnesia Brewery, this is my favorite spot to hang out with friends and enjoy a drink in the summer.\\n\\nAs a beer snob, I would say that their beer selection is decent, yet it seems to need a few more unique brews on tap...at least to make me happy.  The mixed drinks are good though, and the bartenders are friendly and attentive.\\n\\nRon Tom's is the popular place to go that no one knows of...kind of a modern day speak easy.  The crowd is usually a good mix of Portland, with an occasional side of pretentious thrown in."},{"name":"Giacomo's Wayland","address":"14 Elissa Ave","city":"Wayland","stars":"3.5","text":"I was perplexed by the huge dichotomy in the reviews for this place.

I'm trying to find out what to order on the Yelp app before the server gets back.\\"\\n\\n[Time & Date of visit]: Labor day weekend, 20 mins before closing.\\n\\n[Party Size]: 8\\n\\n[Location/Ambiance]:\\n\\nNestled to the left of Trader Joe's in the busy Midtown Promenade plaza. I think it's slightly easier entering and leaving from Virginia Ave. \\n\\nInside:\\nThe restaurant has a U shaped layout for the dining room and pay counter / Kitchen entrance. A long communal table handles large groups and couples easily. Booths for small groups are adorned on the right, with the rest room following straight back.\\n\\nParking:\\nBe prepared to circle around the lot for parking when it's prime time hours. \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nFeels like... quaint. \\n\\n[Service]:\\nFull service - sit down restaurant. \\n\\nThough we came very very close to closing time, two of our DragonCon team really wanted the group to come check out Ah-Ma. Since I had it booked marked anyway, why not. Water refills were pretty good. Food orders came out fairly quickly after ordering. Especially the bao's. \\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\n\\nPork Belly Bao - I'm not usually a fan of really fatty Pork Belly unless it's crispy. But Ah-Ma's version is... well you don't really have to do much chewing. It somewhat melts in your mouth followed by the chewy bao bun. 1 serving I think, isn't really enough for sharing. Especially after the first bite and you realize how good this is. Must try. \\n\\nBraised Ox Tail - Not my usual dish to try, but my bestus tells me braised cooked meats are usually the best as they are slow cooked and simmering in their juices. So, gave it a try. The dish came out with 3 medium sized pieces and one large piece atop a bed of veggies. The medium size pieces were easier to eat and the oh so tender meat was easily pulled with a fork. I think subjective, but the bigger portion contained more fat, so it took a while to gnaw and scrap the actual meat with my fork. I'm a bit basic as I really don't recall having Ox tail before, so to sum it up this was pretty good.  Probably good for sharing due to portion size. \\n\\nBeef Stew - A friend next to me ordered this and I got a couple of spoonfuls here and there. Just the right amount of salt in the broth, tender meat, with a decent amount of soup to meat ratio. Portion wise, not the biggest soup bowl compared to Pho. But this ain't pho, so order your own! Must order or at least sample some from your friend's bowl... if they let you. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nI think Ah Ma is a bit pricey for the portions they serve, but I guess they have to charge that just due to being the area they are in. We were also grateful they didn't have a stink-eye look most of the night as we came in the restaurant before they officially closed and none of the food came out tasting \\"rushed\\". I would say worth a visit if you are nearby within 15 mins.

Overall it was a great trip and my visit to Via Napoli was a highlight.  \\n\\nOne of the neat things about it was that I wasn't planning on going there.  Didn't even know about the restaurant and found out about by accident.  I'm a planner by nature and had already made all my dining reservations months before leaving for the trip.  However, during the ride on the Magical Express bus from the airport to the Resort they played a short feature about the restaurant on the monitors in the bus and it looked so good and so fun I knew I needed to go.  Using my iPhone I quickly logged onto My Magic+ scanned my schedule and found I didn't need to go to Kouzzina again (sorry Cat I still love you and will be back for a visit in May) so cancelled that and made a reservation for Via Napoli.  Pleased with myself as any smug self-richeious Disney freak like me would be I slipped my earbuds in put on the soundtrack for Frozen and napped the rest of the way to the Resort.\\n\\nFinally the night arrives and I make my way from the Villa's at the Wilderness Lodge to the Italian Pavilion in Epcot.  Hedging that if I took the bus to Hollywood Studios and then walked the pathway to that runs between Boardwalk and Beach Club Resorts and to the back entrance of Epcot (very close to the Italian Pavilion) I might arrive faster then waiting for an Epcot bus and walking from the front entrance to the very middle of the World Showcase where the Italian Pavilion is located (about as far from the front entrance of Epcot as you can get).  For those of you who would suggest that I should have taken the water taxi from Hollywood Studios to Epcot my walking pace is faster than water taxi's move and I proved the as one was departing Hollywood Studios as got off the bus and I beat it to Epcot quite handily.\\n\\nArriving at Via Napoli everything was hustle and bustle.  The were many people waiting to be seated and loud voices with New York and Italian accents could be heard echoing throughout the pavilion.  I took this as a good sign that the restaurant was being patronized by those who have a deep appreciation of the cuisine.\\n\\nI reported in at the hostess stand and was promptly seated for my reservation.  After a moment with the menu Andrea my waiter came over and greeted me with a very warm, genuine and friendly welcome.  A few moments of discussing Andrea's hometown in Italy, we reviewed the menu together and recommendations were made.  I wanted to sample so I ordered Piatti Alla Parmigiana - Pollo, Prosciutto e Melone Pizza - Mezzo Metro & Insalata del Contadino knowing I was going to have leftovers to take back to my room.  \\n\\nEverything was delicious and very well presented but the pizza was the  pinnacle of the meal.  The ingredients are imported from Naples, Italy with the exception of the water to make the dough which come from an artisnal well in Pennsylvania that has the same chemistry as the water they would use in Naples.  It is then prepared in one of the 3 wood-burning ovens named after active volcanoes in Italy--Mount Etna, Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli.  I would put the pizza up against some of the best you can find in New York.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is open, welcoming and I would authentic.

My previous rating for this location was a 5 star review! This used to be my favorite seafood restaurant, but it is slowing falling by the wayside. This trip was an absolute disaster! Stopped by after church for a Sunday bite to eat. Which is only fitting because I needed prayer after this visit. It started off decent. We were greeted promptly and seated. Our server came over and asked what we were having to drink. We gave our requests, he then brought us menus and told us he'd be back to take our order (no problem). He comes back a few minutes later babbling about something, then he apologizing because he had us confused with another table (again, no problem). We give our orders and we wait for our food. Now, here come the PROBLEMS!!! Me and my wife are sitting a conversing and all of the sudden I hear curse words being shouted out. I start to look around and to my surprise they are coming from the kitchen. One of the employees is apparently upset about cleaning up something. Keep in mind this is supposed to be a family restaurant. For a couple of minutes the curse words stop. Then they start right back up again, this time I can see the employee who is spewing out the colorful language. At this point I am just very glad my children were not present. But I felt sorry for the table next to me who had 3 or 4 young children sitting with them. While all of this was going one we had waited about 30 minutes and our server had not come to check on us at all. In fact he walked past us several times without saying a word. I listened as other tables had severs who were caring and attentive. I watched as our server maxed and relaxed at the bar. I started to wonder if our server was even a server at all or maybe he was just a kitchen worker who was helping out because they were short. I wondered this because he had absolutely no serving etiquette, we were completely ignored and neglected (as my mother would say \\"like a redheaded stepchild). I watched the managers float about, which I thought was odd because I did not see them stop at any tables. So maybe they weren't actual managers. At this point I felt like I was in the Seafood Twilight Zone. We finally got our food, which was another disappointment. My wife ordered the Queen Crab bucket w/ Joe's Famous BBQ (one of our favorite meals). Well she was very dissatisfied they did not put any seasoning on her veggies. And the seasoning is one of the best parts! She told me she was going to ask the server for some more seasoning and just put it on herself. Well after he walked past about 5/6 more times (not exaggerating) he finally stopped by our table when a normal server would have been bringing us the bill to ask us how the food was. At this point my wife was fed up and had almost finished all of her crab legs. She asked the server for a side of seasoning for her corn and potatoes. About 5/6 minutes later he came back. At that point rather than risk going another 15/20 minutes without him coming to check on us, I asked him for the check. When he brought the check I quickly gave him my card and asked for a box for the rest of my crab dip. He brought me back my receipt with box. At that point I had had enough so I just left my crab dip there. This by far was my worst experience at Joe's. I mean I get that it was the sabbath, but if you come into work you should work...I don't feel like I should be able to pick up on the fact that you didn't want to come into work today. By the way I was going to order a dessert, but our server never asked.

First thing I notice is the health department sticker on the door stating not compliant. Awesome. Hell, we were in line already might as well keep waiting. We were excited to see a fried chicken donut. Sounds ah-mazing! But then a guy who purchased a box full of donuts maybe 5 minutes earlier came back and spoke to the cashier. It turns out there was hair on top of two of the donuts in the box. HAIR!!!!!! Ew. \\n\\nThey replaced the hairy (yes, HAIRY) donuts (shoot I would have asked for a full refund and given the donuts back) and it was our turn to be attended to. I really was not into ordering after that incident but hubby said we might as well. Tried ordering the fried chicken donut- nope, all out of chicken. Maybe scratch that off the board? That would have been helpful. Or, here's an idea, be more prepared and buy enough chicken OR make sure you're making enough donuts. Decided on a buttermilk donut which turned out to be pretty tasty after I inspected every bite for hair. \\n\\nWe did go back yesterday and once again, no luck on any of the donuts we wanted.

Be Our Guest has 3 different rooms to it, the massive gorgeous ballroom, I'm blown away by the attention to detail in this room, the colors are spot on, the chandlers are stunning, the angels painted on the ceiling. Another room showcased in this restaurant is the west wing (it's not forbidden), this room is darker than the ballroom and the main points of the room is the rose, and a picture of Prince Adam the transforms into the Beast when the thunder roars. The last room is The Rose Room, it contains pictures of all the character and Belle and the Beast dancing in the middle of the room.\\nNow onto the food, each of the 3 times I've dined during a different time of the day, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I must say breakfast was my least favorite meal at Be Our Guest: it was quite expensive and French inspired, most of the meals included eggs and I'm not an egg eater. I would have liked if the menu also included american favorites such as pancakes and waffles. I did however enjoy the complementary pastries (although given the price I'm sure I paid for them) \\nLunch is a cheaper offering and I really enjoyed my ham and cheese sandwich and the pomme frites (French fries).\\nDinner is my favorite offering the salmon and the mashed potatoes were just delicious and at the end of dinner you get a chance to get a photo-op with the Beast. (This photo-op is only available a dinner)\\nWhat can I say if you love Beauty and the Beast you will love this restaurant and if you get the chance I highly recommend making reservations for either lunch or dinner.

I liked it, the chocolate flavor was yummy, but I would have liked it enter if it were a bit creamier or bubbly. My companion got the IPA which was decent but not incredibly lavorful - just a basic bitter IPA. Later we shared a Belgian ale which says the best of the three for both of us. It was more complex, creamy with a spicy taste and well carbonated, with a lingering finish. Nice red color. I'd like to return when they have their summer brews ready and try a sampler.\\n\\nThe food was good too, and fairly priced. Not cheap but not terribly expensive either. We both ordered the IPA battered lamb burgers with feta spread. The burgers were great - juicy, crisp on the outside and flavorful. The spread was yummy and the ciabatta bread bun was good too, nice and crunchy. The fries are good too, they are seasoned with salt and crispy on the outside.

I was disappointed to find that they left out the turkey. When the main ingredient (which is in the name of the sandwich) is left off the sandwich, there's a quality control problem with the restaurant. I couldn't rectify the issue, as it was nearing rush hour traffic and I was trying to get to Marietta to visit a friend and her newborn baby before heading out of the greater Atlanta area. In addition to my disappointment, my youngest child could only eat half of his grilled cheese sandwich because one side was burned.

Within seconds the waiter came back to our table and scolded us for having outside food. I tried to explain to him that my boy was hungry and couldn't wait for our food to come but he just got meaner with his gesture and tone of voice. My son was scared and started to cry. In the end my husband had to take my son outside so he could finish his tiny slice of pizza. I understand that many restaurants have the \\"no outside food\\" policy but the waiter acted like we purposely disrespected their rule, forgetting that kids are kids and often times grown ups have to bend our rules for little kids, especially when they are hungry and just woke up from a nap!

I had never had pig ears fried before, and after having them here, I wonder why you'd prepare them any other way.  They are the perfect snack, chewy and flavorful with some crunch as well.  The pickled vegetables seem so simple, but are so crunchy and fresh.  And then that beef noodle soup. Perfect flavor. Tender meat. And those noodles...perfectly chewy and just the right thickness to hold the flavor of the soup. \\n\\nI think my favorite part about this place is the constant improvement in the dishes.  I initially wasn't too impressed with the Lu rou fan (minced pork rice) remembering that the first time I had it, the rice seemed mushy, and it was a little bland.

It was filling, but not massive, and everything tasted so fresh. You can get, mild, medium, or hot sauce with it...and the hot sauce is actually hot, but sooo delicious! It was nice to eat something where I knew what all of the ingredients were without wondering what additives might be in it. It was a really delicious and hearty burrito, and I am looking forward to trying other items on their menu, though it might be hard to stray. \\n\\nAnother review below mentions that this place is great and friendly, but not what they are looking for in a burrito...calling it the \\"White Man's\\" burrito. I can certainly agree with that on some level. It is not bursting with authentic Mexican flavors, and it is definitely more bland. It is a simple and fresh burrito that is a little lighter on the stomach (in my opinion), and good in its own right. I will try Cha Cha Cha as well, but I definitely won't hesitate to go back to Laughing Planet.\\n\\nI also ordered the Organic Shanti Ayurvedic tea which was delicious. This particular tea contains anti-oxidents and boosts the immune system, and the Fall is a perfect time to start drinking that. They serve tea from Tao of Tea, so I'm definitely going to add that one to my tea supply. What a delicious way to maintain health in the colder months.\\n\\nThe eating area isn't huge, but there is also a bar to sit at, and they do serve some beer and a few other alcoholic drink if you are so inclined.

After seeing it on my beltline strolls, I'd gradually started really needing to eat there again, and today my friend and I opted for take out.  I know, take out sometimes doesn't reflect the true goodness of a place, but he had been helping me hang stuff etc all morning and we were in no condition to dine amongst others.  Not to worry...everything was packaged up nicely, still hot and with appropriate textures! \\n\\nHe loves the salt and pepper chicken, so we had an order of those.  This was a little sack of spicy chicken nuggets with fried basil leaves.  They lacked salt for me but he quickly devoured them. I will say that for something still hot and served in a glassine type bag, they remained really crispy. Lu Rou Fan was just as I remembered...perfect serving size of a savory pork and mushroom stew over rice with an egg, pickled radish and cilantro. So comforting. I need to learn how to make this. Pork belly bao? Still the reason why I fell in love with Ah-ma's kitchen in the first place. Glorious hunk of succulent pork belly nestled in a soft little bun and enhanced with some pickled greens, cilantro and peanuts.  Last up, jade tofu.  Lots of mushroom flavor which I loved, little skimpy on the book choy, and some fried egg tofu. I liked it a lot, but the carnivorous friend was sad I didn't get oxtail. He did manage to eat quite a bit, despite his sadness.

They told us it'd take about 15 minutes for a table to open up and we sat down and had to ask for a menu to look over while we waited (they did not offer us a menu even though three different people were manning the FOH). Service was very quick, they cleared a table in less than 15 minutes and we were promptly seated and was able to order our food within a few minutes. \\n\\nWhere my criticism comes in is not the speed of the service but the fact that ALL OF THE SERVERS LOOKED LIKE THEY WANTED TO GO TO BED.

Last year they decided to close and renovate in the middle of the summer (A+ business decision for sure). Now it's a slightly larger concrete box with a giant gaudy LED sign staffed by about 10 people that can't get an order out in under 15 minutes \\n- Post renovation you now have new menu items including summer time favorites like salami stuffed fried dough, and cheeseburger spring rolls. Grab a beach towel, your shades and go cool off with a refreshing pork cutlet sub.\\n- There's almost never such a thing as too much when you're talking portions right? Yeah... unless we're talking food that starts a race against time the second you expose it to air. The medium slush is enormous and stands no chance in even mild summer weather as soon as you walk away from the counter. I'm 190 lbs. I can eat all day.

To this day, I still CANNOT keep from covering my eyes when the Beast captures Maurice.  \\n\\nPoint being, I had high expectations for Be Our Guest restaurant.  We went for lunch, and the line was waaaaay long.  We were assured it would only be about a half hour wait, and let's be honest, I've waited longer for a table at Chili's, so I was more than willing to stand out in the sun to eat in the West Wing.  \\n\\nI was really impressed with the handling of the crowds here.  You enter the restaurant, and are given a plastic rose (nice touch, Disney), which you use to order your food.  Then you can sit ANYWHERE, and by using the rose, your food will find you.\\n\\nWe walked out into the main dining room, which is THE ballroom from the scene where they dance together.

However, this room is huge, and it was pretty loud.  The bustle and clatter took away from the ambiance - when the crowds die down, this room is going to be great.\\n\\nI had to eat in the West Wing.  Walking into the room, I was taken aback - it was like walking into the movie.  The room is pretty small, and very creepy.  The lights are turned down low, and everything is bathed in a dark purple glow.  There is a fireplace with the prince's ripped portrait, and at the back of the room, the rose is floating under it's glass case.  Truly magical. \\n\\nWe sat and our food found us - which is so cool.  This room is much more quiet, just because it is so creepy, I imagine most little kids would be scared to go in.  Please, even I was a bit nervous that The Beast would storm in at any moment and roar at us to \\"GET OUT\\"!!!  There was also a lightning storm, and if you watched closely, when the thunder cracked, the prince's photo changed to the Beast.  If you blink, you'll miss it.\\n\\nOh, and the food was really good.  I had the Pork Coq au Vin (worst name ever, Disney).  If you don't know what to get, go with the steak sandwich, which has to be one of the best food deals in Disney period.

Here's what my picks will be next time: Riders on the Storm, Bicycle Race, and Personal Jesus.  We had some ACDC going- nice breakfast music.\\n\\nRumor #2: The food is not high quality: Negative (but debatable)\\nMy french toast was excellent, the pancakes got a standing ovation.  Well- not really, but it was the item people were most excited about.  We had all heard the potatoes were questionable and greasy.  I think they were fine- but the side order was HUGE, so keep that in mind.  Is this place any greasier than another breakfast place? No.  But the food has more character than the corporate diners.\\n\\nRumor #3: Iffy service: Confirmed\\nThank goodness they give you a pitcher of water right at the start.

Yes- good deal, and a TON of food.  Probably 2 people could split it.  But I do encourage you to examine the menu carefully.  Here's why.... French toast with a SIDE of bacon is $1 cheaper than ordering French toast WITH bacon.  Is that retarded or what?

Rather than politely ask us if we needed more time, the cashier (along with the rude couple) simply pretended we weren't even standing there. So, we got in line as ~3 other people had arrived at the same time as the other couple, while we continued to peruse the menu. When we finally got to the front of the line the same hostess said \\"are you ready to order now?\\" Uh ya think?!? We only just had 5 people's worth of order time to make our minds up. \\n\\nNow, onto the highlight of our meal, as it always should be - the food. I had to get the truffle garlic fries and they did not disappoint! Hubby got the lobster mac n cheese which was very very tasty! I got the spicy shrimp pasta and that was also phenomenal!

First off - I thought about giving the place a 4 stars as we had a great dinner last night, good drink and fun conversation around the bar.  I settled for 3 stars (for now) as breakfast was a  hit or miss for us on Saturday.  Given this a new restaurant working through their grand opening bugs i expect they will only get better.\\n\\nBreakfast\\n\\nBreakfast was a bit hit or miss on the service side which i am chalking up to new servers and new ordering equipment.  \\n\\nMy partner had the basic eggs, home fries, bacon and toast combo.  Was very good, bacon crisp but also chewy.  \\n\\nI should have opted for that item instead  I had the Breakfast burrito which was bit of a let down.  Eggs were good but amount of lettuce (ice cold)  was way too much and the onion was raw - I couldn't get that taste out of my mouth all day.  They also missed adding the jalapenos that were supposed to come with the meal.  So 50/50 on breakfast.\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nWe had a great night at the bar.  Service was good, bartenders very friendly and chatty which is what we like.  Had a great selection of local beers on tap.  House wine was good, not great  but a step up from most house wines.\\n\\nFrench Onion soup -  wow, the size was impressive (a meal in itself).  Lots of onion, bread and gooey cheese.  Was a big hit for both of us.  We also had the meatball sandwich which was also large (half for lunch today).  Meatballs were very tasty, not store bought.  Sauce was good.  Came with awesome pickle and fries that were very good.  \\n\\nSingle Patty hamburger was great.  Came with options for sides.  We chose slaw which was very good.  \\n\\nSo dinner was a hit for us.

If you're going to get the soup, you should probably just have it by itself as an entree because there's so much cheese in it, and it's incredible filling (or fatiguing, as I would call it, because it's just too overwhelmingly fatty and salty). The croque was also very big and greasy - I could only get through one slice of it before I felt like I was oozing grease out of my pores... The braised pork was actually decent and recommendable.\\nCupcakes were delicious - the master cupcake is super tasty with the grey stuff (cookies and cream) icing and moist chocolate cake. Definitely get the master cupcake if you're a fan of those flavors. Price point was OK, in the ~$7-16 range. Definitely worth a visit just to see the interior of the castle if you can't or aren't interested in getting a dinner reservation.\\n\\nDinner service:\\nIf I remember correctly, the dinner service is $65pp, and you get the chance to take a photo with the Beast (he doesn't walk around, you have to go to a room to see him, which is nice). You get to choose from a list of appetizers and entrees, but the dessert is default. For my app, I got the escargot, which was pretty good and lighter than what I usually get (think less butter, more olive oil). My fiance got the octopus for his app, which was quite tender and enjoyable. For my entree, I got the seafood bouillabaisse, which had a mild spiciness to it and was just lovely. The fish, mussels, and lobster all tasted fresh and flavorful - I would definitely be pleased if I got this dish at an expensive french restaurant. My fiance got the filet mignon, rare (aka code word for medium-rare unless you're somewhere very authentic). Pretty standard, no complaints.\\nFor dessert, we got a trio of sweets, including a fresh raspberry macaron, a chip-shaped white chocolate cup of \\"grey stuff,\\" and a truffle. The macaron was sweet and tart, and the two others were pretty much what you would expect. The dessert is served on edible paper, which I personally think is an unnecessary gimmick since the paper doesn't taste good at all. Just because something is edible, doesn't mean it's worth eating!\\nAfterwards we went to get a picture with the Beast. Boy is he tall! I wonder if the guy inside is actually really tall or if his eye-level is somewhere in the neck region LOL\\n\\nOverall, I'm glad I got the experience the much-coveted dinner service, but it's not that worth the hype. If the thought of spending $65 a head freaks you out then don't worry, you're not missing out on that much, just come for lunch and get the cupcakes.

However, it was quite expensive for the small portion size.\\nNow, the minor details:\\n- Their water glasses didn't seem clean. There was a weird taste and/or fishy smell in the water.\\n- I had the avocado toast, which was supposed to come on a croissant. They ran out of croissants and substituted it with sourdough. I really wish I had gotten the croissant because the sourdough was hard like a rock; total opposite of a flaky and fluffy croissant.\\n- I had their donuts, which didn't taste fresh.

The management is the worst part of it all, and you can tell the staff don't even like them. I'm all for paying a premium price for a premium experience. But every visit here has been an Expensive mistake. The last visit on Valentine's Day, we ordered off the app but they didn't even know we had ordered when we sat down and had to show our receipt. Turns out, they sold out of the item we had already paid for earlier that day and were not apologetic and could care less, then the app let us order a side of chips/salsa with our meal and pay extra to add fries, they didn't bring out the chips so we asked for them.

Villa Mexico is a teensy kitchen at the back of a gas station convenience store. You have to squeeze between the counter and the last row of jello, soup, crackers, nutella, etc of the store, everyone stands in a line waiting with their money out, staring straight ahead. Unconventionality is the only real similarity to the Soup Nazi though.\\n\\nWhat I also immediately noticed was that this place is tiny, there is stuff (tupperware, utensils, hot griddles, plates, napkins, etc) EVERYWHERE. However, despite it being super cluttered and real close quarters all surfaces are impeccable, the staff wear gloves at all times (and change them between each order!), and there is not a spot, smudge, or spill anywhere. Really impressive for such a small place.\\n\\nIt takes about 10 minutes (with no line ahead of you) for a burrito but let me tell you, it's worth it. The care and precision put into what the Villa Mexico Master Lady makes is amazing. While I waited for my burrito I watched her make two small soft tacos for the guy next to me and she did it with such care that nothing fell out, awesome. Also I think the exacting way she makes everything accounts for the cleanliness of the place - there are no spills because she doesn't spill. \\n\\nOn to the food. I ordered the Carnitas (pork) Burrito and it was delicious. They put the soft tortilla down on a hot griddle while they're assembling it, stuff it full of meat, guacamole, tomatoes, cheese, beans and, rice, roll it up, then alternate surfaces on the griddle pan so all of the burrito is warm and crispy. The texture is wonderful, biting into a crispy shell to get to the tangy spiced meat underneath was heaven. All told, burrito and extra sour cream with tax, came to $8.16.

After reading the reviews for several places, we decided on BRU since it is relatively close to our home and it was a rainy evening.  This seemingly good decision turned sour, but the food and our server almost made up for it.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were told that there was a 35-minute wait.  There were quite a lot of people ahead of us, but we could either wait 35 minutes here or spend 10-15 minutes in the car and then wait another 15-30 minutes elsewhere.  So we stayed.  Those 35 minutes turned into a wait of over an hour.  The main issue was that it was raining pretty hard and customers were hanging out instead of leaving, which meant that those of us waiting for tables had to wait longer.  However, restaurants are not a new concept, and people hanging out because of rain is not a new concept -- restaurant managers and hosts should know that and take that into account when telling people how long their wait will be.  By the time we were seated, our stomachs thought that our tongues had been cut out.\\n\\nOur waiter, Tate, was a very friendly guy.  He took our order promptly and was quick to answer any questions or to make us happy.  The time that we waited between ordering and receiving our drinks was short, and our food came out not long after.  We each ordered a burger and onion rings.  The burgers were great!  I had the BRU burger, which for me was a fork-and-knife burger because there was no way that I could fit it into my mouth without it falling apart.  My wife had the triple cheese garlic burger, which she thought was delicious, though she suggests that I let readers know that it contains whole cloves of garlic in great quantities -- not for the faint of heart.  Our onion rings were fine, but nothing more than that.  In fact, they were mainly breading.  She received individual onion rings that were heavily breaded, whereas I received a mound of breading with some rings inside that I had to pull apart to be able to eat.  They really do need to back off on the breading.\\n\\nSo, will I return?  Yes, but most likely on a weeknight when the crowds are likely to be smaller.  Will I order the onion rings again?  Likely not.

The iced tea promised on the menu was nowhere to be found.  I'm trying to avoid sugared and/or carbonated drinks, so my only option became the Tropicana Light lemonade coming from the Pepsi fountain.  Sadly, that was barely working and I ended up with water with potentially a hint of lemon.  Finally, the burger itself, which should be the star of the show, but was only notable for the extreme amount of grease. It was, without question, the greasiest burger I've ever had.  There was literally grease dripping the moment I picked it up.  Grease dripped onto the table and onto the extra napkins I had laid out.

Unfortunately atmosphere can only go so far and if they spit in your face while giving you the atmosphere well... 1 star is all that it is worth.\\n\\nHave gone there for breakfast and for dinner... both meals were beyond bad.  \\n\\nBreakfast at our table consisted of the croissant doughnut which was covered with way too much caramel sauce to the point that the doughnut was soggy... Sorry but a doughnut needs to be firm not soggy like something used to soak up a spill.  Other entre was the croque madame.. Now while the flavor was acceptable it has two major problems.  The bread was tough and worse the entire sandwich was cool, not even warm.\\n\\nAlong with that they bring you a plate of pastries that remind you of something you might find in a vending machine if the world had been destroyed and they were only found after a decade... edible to someone starving but otherwise just down right nasty.\\n\\nDinner consisted of pan seared chicken breast, have you ever had chicken breast so tough you had trouble cutting it with a knife?  Well that's just how tough this thing was.  The other entree was the sauteed shrimp and scallops... Now to be honest the shrimp was fine, the scallops however were way overcooked and their version of shrimp and scallops was 2 scallops that was barely two bites in total.  Oh yes I almost forgot it was all served on a pastry so tough it was difficult to cut with a knife.\\n\\nNow the worst part is that at dinner time you don't get access to the drinks bar that you have at breakfast time, so when you need a refill you have to wait on a server which are horrible slow... So drink wisely or you might choke to death before they show up to refill your glass.\\n\\nNow lets get back to the atmosphere... You have 3 rooms to choose from, only you don't have a choice at dinner you get stuck where they put you... If you get the big room then you do get to see the fake snow blowing outside the windows, but you wont be able to hear anyone at your table talking because it is the noisiest room you've ever experienced, making a basketball game at the Final Four seem like a library.   So maybe if you are deaf this room is going to be what you expect, but for anyone else it sucks.\\n\\nWait maybe you'll get the dark room... well the upside is that you don't see the nasty food you just got served, but the reality is the constant thunder and storm effects start getting old and you get annoyed with it after about 5 minutes.\\n\\nWhich leaves the final room with the beast statue with Belle... while the weakest atmostphere wise it is the only one that seemed almost tolerable noise wise, but it is just not that cool looking.\\n\\nIn the end, don't go there.... I know the Cinderella Castle breakfast was a meal I have always warned people to avoid... but if you have kids that are dead set on some of these atmosphere meals go for the castle over this one, this experience has title of absolute biggest waste of time and money in all of Disney.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nHave gone back for breakfast for a daughter that just had to experience the place.  Well I can now add an update to the breakfast choices.  We tried the select meat and cheeses this time around.  The meats were a bit too smokey, but at least you get three different varieties to try.  The cheese on the other hand is just a big chunk of brie, at least it looked like brie the taste was just disgusting.  No one at the table could stomach whatever it was was it actually made me long for blue cheese which is not something I would normally ever want.  And that was it for the cheese one chunk of junk.  \\n\\nOther thing to understand is that no longer are the different entrees priced differently they are now all $25 a pop.  Making it more annoying is that if you go solo you get an entire tray of pastries to yourself... You go with more people at the table and you have to split that same tray.  Somehow that really doesn't seem fair now does it?  Woman sitting at the table beside you gets an entire muffin to herself and because you have someone with you at your table you can either fight over it or just take a piece of it... Which wouldn't be a problem if the entrees were enough to fill you or at least were edible to begin with.\\n\\nNeedless to say this place is still 1 star and your going for the atmosphere... enjoy it and with luck you'll never have to go back again.  Just to show you how much you are paying for the atmosphere, you can get an equivalent breakfast in the French pavilion at EPCOT for just over 10 dollars vs your nasty one here that is barely edible for $25.  You can do the math."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for drinks and appetizers with a crew a week ago.

It really didn't taste like any of the flavors listed in the ingredient list. Both peppercorn and horseradish were listed in the description and I couldn't taste a trace of either. It just tasted like a plain burger, and the sauce tasted like the kind of beef gravy you might get on a Stouffer's Salisbury steak. The coleslaw was bad, like someone just cut up cabbage and completely forgot to dress it. The drink was very sweet, but really delicious.\\n2) A patty melt, fries, and a bourbon barrel ale -- The patty melt was pretty good, exactly what you'd expect; the fries were pretty good, crispy enough without being overdone; and the beer was good, if you like that kind of beer.\\n3) The fried cod sandwich, fries, and a Manhattan -- The fish sandwich was horrible, soggy breading with no flavor; the fries were good as described above, and the drink wasn't great, I think they made an old fashioned (heavy on the bitters) instead of a Manhattan.\\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice, and the service was great, even on a night where there was a short wait for a table.

I'd had my eye on this one for a while now, so we set out.  Apparently, everyone else was at the Asian Festival since the place was completely empty when we walked in a little shy of 1 PM.  The waiter was extremely friendly and polite (not the usual brisk Chinese restaurant waitstaff).  \\n\\nWe glanced over the Indonesian dishes but nothing sounded particularly appealing there on this hot afternoon.  We opted instead for the roast pork, shredded duck with bean sprouts, and beef vegetable chow fun.  The roast pork was the highlight of the meal -- crispy, fatty, succulent -- ah!  We ordered half a pound as an appetizer, and that was more than enough for the two of us -- it is, after all, somewhat rich.  The shredded duck and bean sprouts was good, a nice combination of crisp vegetables and meat, though probably not something that I would order again.  I was a little disappointed in the chow fun -- the sauce was about right, but the noodles lacked that rich char which comes from being stir fried in a hot wok.  The meat, vegetables, and sauce were all poured over the top instead of being cooked in together.  Still, in a town where General Tso's chicken is the standard for Chinese take-out, it was passable.  I do prefer Sunflower for chow fun, but the roast pork here at Lily's is EXCELLENT.\\n\\nThey aren't going to win any awards for decor or ambiance, but really, that's not what this is about.

I decided to go with a salad, and my buddy also went with a salad, that was accompanied by 3 skewers of meat. We also ordered a porter that ended up tasting like a watered down Guinness, but we won't hold that against them seeing as how they didn't brew the beer themselves. But still, charging medium to higher end craft beer prices for a watered down Guinness is something that I can and will put on Habibi.\\n\\nSo when we get our real food, my Fattoush salad was salty and felt like it consisted mostly of tomato. It was kind of like that Family Guy analogy where they describe how every Italian pizza parlor makes their own house salad (I'll let you look it said clip up on your own). Anyways, it was kind of like that, and while it did help to balance out the high levels of sugar I'd been eating, it didn't do much for me taste wise.\\n\\nOn the other hand though, my buddy's Kabab plate looked, and tasted, amazing. After vocalizing my distaste for the Fattoush, he let me have a bite of his Kebabs, and I instantly had buyers remorse.

This time there were fewer ingredients, less flavor, and the chicken had been cooked to death, dried out and leathery, whereas on our previous visit it had been perfect. \\n4) She asked for her pasta on the side, as the last time. Previously it was served with the marsala sauce, this time it came with a completely unrelated and unwanted red sauce. That was just weird. \\n5) The fried calamari this time was a greasy mass, with all the pieces glued together.

On one end, there is a counter and cash register, a little station for water and cutlery, and garbage cans. \\n\\nThe service wasn't all that friendly, but not bad. The lady behind the counter was polite and courteous, but she barely cracked a smile the whole time we were up there. \\n\\nThe menu is on the smaller side, but there were a lot of enticing choices.  I went with the butter chicken while my SO chose the nehari. We also ordered naan, not realizing that the entrees don't come with rice. \\n\\nUnfortunately for my delicate flower self, my dish was a wee bit too spicy for me. We ended up ordering a plate of rice halfway through the meal. While there are indicators on the menu of spice level (zero, one, or two chiles), I think that is really a relative scale. For example, my dish had no chiles next to it, but it was too spicy to eat on its own. I was downing naan in an attempt to offset the spice. Then again, I fully admit that I am a wuss about spicy stuff. So this may just be a case of me needing to get out of the proverbial kitchen. Hence the rice. And more naan. And two sweet lassi drinks. We tend to go a little overboard sometimes. \\n\\nAnyway, the food itself was pretty darn tasty. On the greasy side, but yummy. The naan was just the tiniest bit dry, but had good flavor. The saffron rice was amazing. As soon as I smelled it, I wanted it in my belly. The butter chicken was delicious and full of flavor (and spiciness). I didn't even attempt to sample my SO's nahari for fear any part of me that touched it would just burst into flames. \\n\\nOnce we were stuffed, we cooled down with some lassi.

I'm so glad I was able to get dinner reservations for Be Our Guest because it was definitely worth it!  First off, they have a cast member outside of the restaurant doors who keeps people without reservations from even entering the restaurant.  This was a serious plus because it meant people weren't just swarming the place for photos and such (a few diners were moving about taking photos, but that's fine if you compare it to a park full of kids and their parents just popping in to do the same thing while you're trying to relax and eat).  I requested to be seated in either the ballroom or the west wing (since I wasn't that keen on the rose gallery area).  Our request was granted and we were sat in the awesome west wing.  Our seater led us through the restaurant first and she was super polite and very 'in-character' as a worker at the beast's castle.  It was a great time.\\n\\nOur table was lovely and the west wing room was very cool.  It's dark in there and contains the enchanted rose and a portrait of the prince which changes into the beast when lightening strikes every 10 or so minutes.  Our waitress was also very friendly and informative.  I got the Conundrum wine (wine at MK, love it!), the thyme-scented pork and the grey stuff.  My husband got the lamb and also got the grey stuff.  The food was delicious and so was the bread they brought.  Hands down, the grey stuff was the best dessert we had on our entire vacation.  It was so incredible!  I loved that our waitress decorated each of our plates after we ordered.  It was nice to have the cart of desserts as well so that you could see our actual choices before ordering.  \\n\\nWhen you leave, you get to have your photo taken with the beast.

Long story short, my son never received his food nor did I get a refill on the popcorn.

From the moment we walked in the door everything exceeded expectations, from the friendly staff, to the seating, the decor, our server, the drinks, and the food.  It was all spot on.  Our large, half-moon booth faced the inside of the restaurant and provided the perfect setting for sharing plates.  And I feel like we totally scored with our server, Jackson, who was not only a server and a bartender (mixologist) but a wine expert (which came in handy).  I knew Jackson was more than alright when he seemed unfazed by my husband's high-maintenance drink request (don't ask, please; I would have to roll my eyes).  We started with craft cocktails which were all delicious and well though out.  I've seen reviews scoffing at the price ($13) but come on, people.  These are quality, hand crafted cocktails.  $13 is fair.  While we were visiting, the menu was Spain, so we started with an assortment of olives and patatas bravas (fried cubes of potatoes drizzled with cheese sauce - OMG we almost ordered a second round) from Spain, and the nshima patties from the Resident menu.  We also ordered the okra, but it didn't arrive and we completely forgot about it until we were in the car on the way home, so oh well...next time!  For entrees, we ordered the scallops from the Resident menu, and the squid ink pasta, the Moroccan snapper, and the the American NY Strip from the Spain menu.  Everything was so good and flavorful.  I cannot get over the sauce that topped my snapper - I seriously could have enjoyed a bowl of that.  The combination of spices was perfect, and the slightly citrus undertones tied the spices into the fish perfectly.  For dessert, we had the coconut pistachio cardamom sorbet, and the Youtu box which was taro brownie chunks with taro sorbet on top.  These were some of the best desserts I've had.  I get so tired and bored with all of the typical desserts at restaurants, so to enjoy unique, new flavors was such a welcome surprise.

He started off by making fun of the delivery driver on the phone with us and then told us he would dock the amount of our order from his pay. We were even offered to have the delivery driver work off of the clock, after his shift ended, to make us a new one and delivery it. We already had received more than we bargained for. We declined the offer for the driver to work for no pay after his shift ended and then told Bob we did not want our meal comped if it meant the driver was losing pay (our apartment isn't exactly easy to find so we did not feel he was incompetent or deserving of this). Bob assured us the meal was coming out of the driver's check whether we wanted it to or not. Our next step was to, sorrowfully, tell Bob we will no longer order from Galla's as we do not believe they have respect for their employee's and this is just a bad business practice. Bob then told my wife to, \\"Have a nice life!\\" and proceed to hang up on her. \\n\\nThis tale does not end yet, my friends, hold on. Bob called my wife back about 5 minutes later to tell her how he was right and she has no idea who she is talking to.

My wife asked if he was the owner of Galla's as she would've liked to plea with him not to take the pay from our delivery driver.

There is a Togo option and looks like people waited around the same time. The burgers themselves had no complaints. Cooked perfectly and not messy. The veggie burger is made of mushrooms, quinoa, and chickpeas. It was my first time eating a veggie burger with sliced mushrooms as opposed to everything being blended together. The fries come with a chipotle mayo which pairs nicely with them. There is also an assortment of sauces on the table to pair with your burgers. Our favorite was the chipotle ketchup.

When I looked at the receipt, I saw that I was charged for 2 beverages for $8. I was confused because I initially thought it was free if it was water, so I asked one of the employees. Our conversation went a little like this:\\n\\nMe: Do you charge for water?\\nEmployee: No, we do not.\\nMe: Okay, so why was I charged here on my receipt for 2 beverages?\\nEmployee: Oh, well that's because it's self-serve so the water is included in the fountain station so you can just get it there.\\nMe: .... so you're saying you do charge for water. \\nEmployee: Yes.\\n\\nNever even bothered to try to talk to someone else because it was really busy and it wasn't worth it to me, so I just ended up getting the drink since I was charged for it... but it was pretty annoying.\\n\\nAs for the food itself..\\nCroque Monsieur: It was decent, but nothing special about it.\\nFrench onion soup: We ended up adding a little more salt and pepper because it did not really have any taste.\\nGrey stuff cupcake: It was good, but not great.

Our server returns to explain that he put all of the items in at the same time, but since my dad didn't order an appetizer, it came out first. I have some issues with that, because I specifically said we would share the appetizers. Moreover, since he didn't \\"order\\" an appetizer, shouldn't the apps and his lasagna then come out at the same time?

Our server, Johnathan, was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  He was also very patient as I mulled over the selections - so many options! For cocktails, I opted for the El Navagador. Gin is never my first liquor of choice unless it's a part of what appears to be a tasty cocktail and this was indeed tasty! Speaking of which, the bartender was very serious about his craft, mocking me for my request for a stirrer (only because a friend asked) and granting me a full straw instead since stirrers aren't kept onsite... despite the banter, he made excellent drinks.  :-)\\n\\nWe visited during the Columbia visa offering.  Let's start with the things that shined: Eggplant cheese dip, coxinhas, The Diplomat, and Thai okra. We were all skeptical about the cheese dip but it was very much a pleasant surprise.  The coxinhas were very full of flavor and packed just the right amount of spice. The Diplomat was just downright a really good burger.  My friend ordered it and she was nice enough to offer me a morsel of beef patty along with remnants of mushroom and gouda... that small bit was delish so I can only imagine how it was in real life.  I'm typically not an okra fan but I sampled some from another friend's plate... the okra wasn't slimy and paired well with the sweet chili sauce.\\n\\nThe rest of our food wasn't bad by no means but it wasn't overly mind blowing either - duck confit, Brussels sprouts, duck fat fingerling potatoes, Colombian empanadas. The duck confit would've been a star but I felt like it was overpowered by the Korean BBQ sauce... paired with with dried cranberries, it was a tad bit too sweet but still good. The beef empanadas were flavorful but the mushroom variety was lacking some umph - same for the brussel sprouts. The Potatoes definitely could've been a tad bit crispier.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a very solid experience. The cocktails are amazing and the ambiance was very cool and intimate.

Its basically a chicken fillet battered with almonds, sesame seeds and something else which makes it crunchy. It has Asian slaw as a garnish. I wasn't really feeling it. It wasn't very flavorful.

I hope they have it next time! The 2nd favorite that day was the olive oil orange cake donut. It was really moist and had a delicate orange flavor. The 3rd one I tried was the blueberry bourbon basil. I gotta say, that was the least favorite of all their donuts I've tried.

We love the Mr. Bob's burrito, and for extra goodness add extra chorizo & avocado.  Oh and did I mention the flan?  You know how many Mexican restaurants have rather lousy desserts?  Well, you have got to try the flan!  it's very different and so much better than any flan you have ever had! \\nSadly they are never open on Saturdays and that tends to be our favorite day for Mexican food, but we have managed to get in on the other days.  We start to have withdrawals if we don't get us some Connie's at least every couple weeks!  \\nSad to hear they will no longer be open evenings - but admit we mostly ate there for dinner because we usually eat dinner before 6 & they did not reopen until 6. \\nWe also always loved that they allow you to bring your own wine & they will provide glasses.

The Chicken Fried Rice was  more than any I have ever ordered before, so I really did not need the side of Fried Rice, but because of the quantity of the items I am able to make a complete meal again today. The Japanese Cheese Cake was nice but was not a typical cheese cake, I would recommend they add more possibilities to their deserts. The food was still warm when it arrived and delicious to eat.

The waitstaff were friendly and attentive. The menu varied with a mix of tasty pasta and prime meats. The drink and cocktail list was extensive. Make a reservation here early to catch a meal at this new beacon in Lynn's downtown.\\n\\nAppetizers: We started off our meal (a birthday dinner) with two appetizers. The first was the antipasto platter ($14.95) which was not your typical antipasto. Cured meats, cheeses, tomatoes, and olives are served on a wooden board. It seemed small at first, especially for the price, but was of high quality and was enough for the 4 of us to share. We then tried the Beef Short Rib Tortellini ($11.95), recommended by the friendly manager. The 4 mid-sized tortellini were delicious and served with a madiera wine sauce. As any good restaurant should, Rosetti's did not scrimp on the quality or quantity of fresh bread and oil.\\n\\nMain Dish: I had the Sweet Italian Sausage with broccoli rabe, bean, and cavetelli ($17.95). The large chunks of sausage and pasta were served in a moderate white sauce with a nice flavor. I would probably try one of the entree specialties next time as I felt this sausage dish was just ok. Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad about it. The white beans seemed to dry out the taste. I also sampled the Chicken braciolettini ($18.95), which was excellent. Filled with prosciutto and cheese and served with browned yukon gold potatoes, it was a flavorful meat option that I'd probably have as my full meal at my next visit. I will definitely be returning to try the nightly specials as I've been told go on Friday/Saturday nights to unlock veal and pork daily specials.\\n\\nAmbiance: My only qualms about the restaurant rest in the interior noise-level. While a previous reviewer sarcastically remarked that the interior has a \\"chipotle\\" feel, this reflects the modern, fire-lit, steel interior - very minimalist, and very common for upscale restaurants in Boston. However, the minimal decorations on the walls and building materials seem to magnify sounds making a reverberation of noise in the dining area. I'm assuming this will be addressed with padding or insulation by the management. Not a huge deal, but it did seem excessively loud to a point of disrupting a romantic moment between a couple. As for the neighborhood, there is plenty of on-street and off-street parking near-by. Some may gripe about the restaurant being in Lynn's downtown, but these people have not visited recently. There is a good effort to clean the area up with antique lighting and the area is making promise so there is nothing to worry about. I probably wouldn't walk from the MBTA rail station to Sutton Street without knowing your way around.\\n\\nMake a reservation early because this place fills up fast and is extremely popular for good reasons. Also, check if there is a show at the Lynn Auditorium when you visit, which may make it even harder to get a reservation. We will be returning and I hope this restaurant is just one of many to come in a revitalized downtown Lynn dining scene."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"11602 Regency Village Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I wasn't expecting much since it was their grand opening week, however the food and staff were amazing.

I will say that the food wasn't very hot when it got to our table, which was a bit disappointing, but the flavors were there and I appreciated the level of spice-- not too much and not super mild (we got level 2). One thing to note that we didn't realize: there is a $1 upcharge for each refill on the daikon. However, the refill portion they bring out is much heartier than the initial sampling they give you for free. We ordered the daikon both times that I've been here because it's worth it and balances with the food well, but just thought I'd mention it because we didn't realize it the first time we came.\\n\\nOverall, tasty food that I often crave and pricing is decent. Things to note: they DO use MSG so if you have a sensitivity to that, I'd avoid this spot. Pricing ranged from $12-$15 for the plates we ordered. They do offer a lunch menu, though I've not had the pleasure of trying it yet. Probably 3.5 stars, but it's the holiday season so 4 it is."},{"name":"Tim Hortons","address":"4401 W 10th Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"This is the worst coffee shop in Point Grey.

The inside was beautiful and the service from the servers was great, however the people at check in and in the computer kiosk room were borderline rude (very disorganized and the computers were very very slow and giving people a hard time and the cast members became a little snippy about it). The servers magically find you in the dining room. I have no idea how the other rooms were and I'm a little disappointed at the cattle corral mentality that was going on. We made the reservation a little more than a month in advance. I checked almost daily and managed to luck out with grabbing an early 8:15am time slot.

Anyway, put the one dollop of dressing, and panicked because I couldn't figure out what kind of dressing it was and was terrified I wouldn't have enough.  If the salad itself weren't so incredibly flavor-full, especially the salty and perfectly spiced croutons, it wouldn't have been.  But it was perfect - and hubby and I each had a huge bowl each of this salad.  Nom nom!\\n\\nMac n cheese: good.  Not great, but great mac n cheese is rare.  Plus, again, it was awhile back ago, so can't, unfortunately, analyze it for you.\\n\\nI really liked the carrot cake.  Now, my mother in law makes almost the best carrot cake ever.  This is a different kind of carrot cake than hers, definitely without any raisins or coconut or (almost certainly) pineapple.  But it does have a different \\"feel,\\" different crumbs.  And it's not that sweet, which I really like!  And it's not too spice cakey, which is different.  The frosting is also not too sweet - yet really goes well with this cake.  It is almost a match made in heaven, but, no it didn't make me swoon.\\n\\nWhat we also love is that Sweet Carrot doesn't use styrofoam!  That's right: save the environment!  (If you have a garden, you can compost the containers!)\\n\\nWe thought the prices seemed about right.  And, both times, we were able to share and be full afterward.\\n\\nAfter tonight's meal, I've made a conscious decision to order more often.

I went to Henri's on a Saturday afternoon at the tail end of brunch. The place itself is small, but it feels more cozy than cramped. The restaurant was fairly empty too. \\n\\nI sat at the bar and ordered a glass of the jean luc columbo rose, which I enjoyed. I like wine, but I'm not knowledgeable enough in it to be too picky. For food I ordered the parrano grilled cheese with chips (you get an option of chips or a salad). I love cheese. I love bread. Therefore, I love grilled cheeses and this one was delicious. Also, it arrived pretty quickly. The sandwich had roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions with Gouda cheese on sourdough. Sometimes when tomatoes are on a grilled cheese it seems like they just sit on top of the cheese and end up sliding out when you take a bite. Not the situation here. Everything melded together perfectly. Flavors included. I'm not a big fan of onions, but they actually went well on the sandwich. \\n\\nThe only downside was that the bartender wasn't as attentive as he could've been. It was a small bar too and I was one of the only people sitting at it. Maybe he was just winding down since brunch was ending. Not a big deal.

The noodles are so perfectly well done - they're large chewy udon noodles. There's broth in the dish, but it's not necessarily a soup. The pork is always tasty, and the peanuts and wonton/eggroll skins give it a nice crunch. Getting a spoonful of the noodles, meat, veggies, and crunchy toppings makes for the greatest bite - I really can't say enough about it. \\n\\nIf you've never had their speciality Cao Lau, the owner will personally come over and demonstrate how you prepare it for eating, and will mix everything up for you. It's all part of the experience!"},{"name":"Sage Woodfire Tavern - Atlanta","address":"3050 Windy Hill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Love love love those appetizers!

Then when the Grandview location opened, it felt a bit like the menu was copied and pasted. And that felt a little empty. I'm thrilled to report that after a few months, Sweet Carrot has fleshed things out a little more. They still have the original favorites (the fried artichokes, loaded corn cakes, mac and cheese, all that smoked meat... drool) -- but now they have many more sides, snacks, and soups! The enhanced menu is perfect. And so many bonus points for clearly marking which items are gluten-free! \\n\\nThe decor here is ADORABLE. I love love love that they kept the Rife's Market-style neon sign! The interior is so bright and cheery -- it's impossible to be in a bad mood. They have totally maximized the space -- so many tables in every nook and cranny, but it somehow doesn't feel completely cramped. \\n\\nWhen the truck was happening, the staff was always incredible. I was a little confused when the Grandview location opened because the sweet staff seemed to be gone and replaced with some snarky fellas who cared more about their funny hats, undercuts, and man-tights than the customers. The not-so-great service actually kept me away for a couple months. I've since returned a few times and had much better service! It seems like the Sweet Carrot magic is back. Hooray! \\n\\nI know that good food, good service, and a good location cost a lot of money. It's still kinda hard to stomach the high cost here. The other day I had a corn cake, a few artichokes in a boat, and a tiny glass of soda -- for $16-ish plus tip.

All three had so many shredded toppings it was hard to taste the main ingredients. The fish and shrimp were both deep fried and I could hardly tell one from the other. One of our party ordered the Al Pastor Tostadas and they were simply the same ingredients as the taco but on a hard corn shell. The ratio of pineapple to pork was definitely more pineapple and it was hard to tell if it was canned or fresh. \\nAlso, a piece of the actual wall fell off just next to and above the front door, hitting some lights exposing a hole to the outside, but I suppose that is part of being in an old building and actually was funny to the customers and wait staff.\\nOverall, I will go back to sit outside and have a drink and some guac with fantastic service but I'll probably go elsewhere for tacos."},{"name":"Fire On The Bayou","address":"921 Town Center Dr, Unit 1100","city":"Orange City","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was some of the tastiest that I've had.

The gentlemen who greeted us took the time to step us through the menu and make helpful suggestions.\\n\\nWe shared appetizers of vitumbua and sambusas.  The vitumbua ($1 each) out-shined the pretty good sambusa ($1.50).  It was a doughy, semi-sweet, fried rice ball.  The sambusa had a nice flaky shell, but was on the small side.\\n\\nMy lunch consisted of goat peanut butter soup with a side of rice and banku.  I had never tried banku so I didn't know what I was in for.   From what the gentlemen explained, banku should be eaten with a stew or soup and consists of fermented corn or cassava, corn in this case.  It comes out as a baseball size ball of dough, and when you pinch a chunk off you get a strong sour aroma that is best described as \\"farm fresh\\".  Most in the party tried it, but stuck with their jallof or white rice.  Getting past the initial smell I did finish it, and enjoyed the texture and flavor when completely dunking it into my soup.  I'm glad to have tried it, but I'll probably will stick with just rice next time.\\n\\nSharing tastes between the party, I think I enjoyed the goat stew the most.  I didn't get to try the waakye though.\\n\\nOverall the food was really good, but I limited my rating to a generous 4 star because the value didn't seem to be there.

The place is a bit small but very clean! I haven't had time to try their other dishes, but depending on the day of the week they have certain dishes that they offer. To be honest I'm not a big fan of Chicken Noodle Soup (Pho Ga) but this place by far is my favorite place. Price point wise it's very reasonable, portion is big and honestly you can't go wrong coming in on any day of the week.

First off, as noted by other reviewers, they have a $7 minimum on purchases, but you can buy a ridiculous amount of stuff for that amount.  For example, I purchased: two scallion buns, two spicy pork steam buns, and one jalapeno cheese roll. That's basically three breakfasts!!!!  The lady who assisted me was super duper helpful and let me know the exact times to microwave each savory treat. PRO-TIP: put the pork steam buns under running water and then microwave for 45 seconds for optimal deliciousness.  I've had the regular steam buns before, but I was pleasantly surprised that the spicy pork ones had clear vermicelli noodles in addition to spiced (sadly, not super spicy), shredded pork.  If you're looking for a spicy/savory treat, I highly recommend the jalapeno cheese roll.

I've had a few minor issues in the past with Canton Buddha, for example, sour sweet iced tea and soggy fried dishes that should be crispy. Well, tonight I ordered some very simple egg drop soup. Two small orders to go, and a sweet tea. First, the middle aged man that rang me up seemed irritated that I was paying my check with a debit card. TOUGH! You either want business or you don't. Secondly, the sweet tea I ordered was extremely sour. Being in food service for many many years, I know sweet tea will get sour if it's not refrigerated for extended periods or is old. Dirty dispensers can also contribute to sour tea. I told him it was so sour it should be thrown out and not served to any other customers. He just grunted at me as he filled my sour tea cup with lemonade. He didn't get rid of the tea. It'll probably be served to many more unsuspecting customers. I left and headed home shortly after with my bag of soup. \\n\\nWhen I got home, I opened a container of soup and added a little soy sauce and those tasty crunchy fried noodles you get. I stirred it all up and thankfully noticed a strange unidentified object in the cup swimming in the soup. I removed it, and I'm still not sure what it is. It almost looks like an old pea covered in fuzzy mold. I'm not positive that's what it was, but you can see a photo I added to the Canton Buddha Yelp page. \\n\\nI can no longer recommend this establishment to my late night Uber passengers, and I myself will not be visiting this restaurant again.

We went for my birthday after I declined to go to Bonefish Grill. We all make mistakes! We (party of 2) walk in and wait for over 15 mins to be seated even though there were only about 5 tables occupied. No big deal as I thought maybe they're short staffed. Finally someone comes up after we had been standing there and sits us at our table. Another 15 mins our waitress finally comes. She wasn't pleasant at all; she seemed rather annoyed. She took our drink order but then didn't return for another 15 minutes. At this point we went ahead and gave our app order & entree order all together because we were afraid that she wouldn't come back for a while. All while this is going on people are walking in the door to be seated and no one acknowledges them even though employees are just standing around talking to each other about their weekend rendezvous! Literally the only person working was the \\"bus boy.\\" He was cleaning around the whole restaurant. He saw people waiting to be seated (only 4 tables in the restaurant now) he went & seated them himself! Kudos! I heard him say I've never done this but I'll get you seated and we'll get your drinks started. Again kudos to him for at least trying while his coworkers stood around and talked. Our waitress brings us our food which my salad looked awful, brown romaine lettuce, a glob is dressing..no thanks; my crabs legs were about 5 mins from being cold & she brought our app with the entrees. But it's fine because I mean it's better than never at this point. She dropped off our food and our check at the same time and didn't return. No refills the whole time and no asking if food was okay. Again the \\"bus boy\\" asked us if we needed anything and I explained about the food, he said he'd get a manager and he got us refills as well. The manager never came out. What a shame! I think maybe a renovation of the staff & manager would be a great fix for this place..except for the bus boy..he actually has customer service, works and is eager to learn.
