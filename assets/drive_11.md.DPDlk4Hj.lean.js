The doughnut \\"bun\\" held up with the sandwich and functioned as a serviceable holder of the meat and fillings.  It justified the price.\\n\\nI suggest going with someone and sharing a sandwich and a dessert.\\n\\nThere are tons of drink specials and some are great value like the 512 pecan porter with a shot of Jameson caskmates for 7 bones.  The bartender (Harrison) on the day we went was a young friendly guy who did a nice job of keeping and eye on us and being totally unpretentious to us and everyone else.

So far so good.\\n\\nWe stroll up to the hostess stand...\\n...\\n...There are two people standing there, neither of whom acknowledge us so we stand there for a bit until someone else else walks up to the stand and seats us. Ok, a little annoying.\\n\\nThe food and waiter (Niko) totally redeemed that though.\\n\\nI started off with a pomegranate vodka + pomegranate juice + other juice. Honestly it just kinda tasted juice - not the most \\"intricate\\" cocktail I've had but I mean, it was probably 2 parts juice anyways.\\n\\nWe opted for the Meze and Whole Fish dinner which consists of the following yummy stuff:\\n\\nThree spread tasting - The boyfriend liked the roasted red pepper the most because it had a hint of spicy and was fully delicious. Direct quote. My favorite was the eggplant caviar because it was tangy but also had some substance, I had honestly forgotten it was eggplant until I read the menu again. The potato spread was good but overshadowed by the red pepper and eggplant spreads. The pita was so good that you could probably just eat it on its own.\\n\\nPrawn Saganaki - This is a dish with two large shrimp marinating in a tomato sauce of some sort. For the uncultured, like me, the sauce is reminiscent of marinara sauce but it is lighter and not nearly as salty (which is something Kyma does well - they apply salt very little it seems). Shrimp was probably the most tender I've ever had and they are already pre-cut so you don't look like a fool trying to get the tail off.\\n\\nBaby Calamari - We typically always get calamari as an appetizer at restaurants because we are suckers for fried squid with marinara. However this calamari was tender (are you beginning to see a pattern?) and lightly battered with a fluffy coating. A squeeze of lemon juice is all you need to really bring out the flavor of the calamari.\\n\\nSpicy Lamb Pie - The presentation on this dish is beautiful, the lamb is wrapped in a phyllo crust, wrapped around and topped with some greens. The focus of the dish is definitely the lamb which is appreciated because the filo accentuates the lamb and wasn't too thick.\\n\\nDaily Special (Crab cake over quinoa) - They actually forgot to bring this out to us before the fish entree but we mentioned it to our waiter and they brought it out promptly. The quinoa was nutty and flavorful, although if I had to choose my least favorite, it would be this one. It was still very good but this one wowed me the least. I may have also just been really full...\\n\\nRoyal Dorade - They serve the fish with a side of spinach & quinoa. At this point, my taste buds were too overloaded to be incredibly discerning so all i have to say is that this is definitely a chewier fish but also very flavorful.\\n\\nSince it was my birthday, they also comped a dessert of my choice which I thought was very nice of them and the chocolate lava cake paired very well with the cinnamon ice cream (surprising, because I don't really like cinnamon).\\n\\nService - Oh my gosh the service was so good. The waiter gave really good food recommendations and also had extra amuse bouches/desserts sent out (so we could try more authentic Greek cuisine!) The courses were also timed perfectly, each empty dish would be whisked off the table whilst another meze came.\\n\\nVerdict - This is very very good seafood with excellent service. Bring your date here if you want to impress them (although the drinks may just be so-so)."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is bomb so far!

This is what I thought of everything:\\nSalad Bar: very standard salad bar but greens and tomatoes were fresh. They had macaroni salad that was very good and some sauerkraut-pickle mixture that was decent as well.\\nPotato Soup: located right next to the salad bar and man this was excellent! Very creamy, without the large chunks of potatoes that usually end up in these soups which I dislike, very flavorful and went perfect with the rolls.\\nSausage Stew: Not really a stew but rather a dish of sausage, beef, pasta, onions, and a few peppers. This stew was very flavorful with strong hints of the meats and black pepper. The meats themselves were very tender and went well with the gravy sauce/broth. \\nBahama Mama: This is their signature sausage for a reason..it's perfectly spicy, has great snap, simply an amazing wurst. \\nMilder Bahama Mama: similar to above but without the spice, so why?\\nBratwurst: Nothing special here to be honest\\nSauerkraut: standard side to go with your sausages, nothing special as far as sauerkraut is concerned though.\\nRed Cabbage: Schmidt's red cabbage is amazing. Diced apples give it just a touch of sweetness to go with the red cabbage and vinegar flavor, perfect flavor balance overall.\\nPotato Salad: Another excellent side. Their potato salad has a great, slightly vinegary flavor with finely diced bacon and onions added in to make it just perfect.\\nGreen Beans And Spaetzle: Very little spaetzle here unfortunately. The green beans were pretty average but the small pieces of bacon cooked in were appreciated. \\nCorned Beef and Cabbage: The corned beef gave the cabbage nice flavor but without making this taste like a meat side dish, and the cabbage was just on the verge between softness/crispness which I enjoyed. \\nYams and Apples: This was pretty mediocre, not very sweet or flavorful in any way as you might expect. \\nMacaroni & Cheese: Your standard mac & cheese.\\nChicken and Rice: Average tasting rice with small chunks of chicken, nothing special.\\nJumbo Creampuff: For only $3.50 extra on the buffet you can get a creampuff, so I ordered a pumpkin creampuff to-go since I was stuffed after three decent trips to the buffet (what a breakfast to start the next morning with). The creampuff was good but not really my thing. It lacked much pumpkin flavor that I expected, but it was huge and I think it would have been better fresh as well. \\n\\nOverall, a lot of the buffet selections were outstanding with a few that I would consider \\"just average\\"- mainly the non-German specialties. With a price tag of $9.99 for the lunch buffet and the amount of food you get, this is hard to beat, especially when you can add a half-pound cream puff for only $3.50 more. The service was friendly, and every time I returned from the buffet my plate had been cleared in the 30-45 seconds I was gone.

The frosting was hard and gritty sweet, the cake was kinda dry.  Bad aftertaste after.

I had a bite and bleh.  It was a funky combo in my mouth.  Dry cake and super gritty frosting again, didn't even taste like strawberries.\\n* Tollhouse chocolate chip cookie:  This was the best thing I ate out of everything and supposedly the most popular from what the lady told me.  It was moist and tasted like a yummy chocolate chip cookie.\\n* Pumpkin spice whoopie pie: I could really taste the pumpkin, ok tasting but nothing wow.\\n* Banana whoopie pie:  Tasted a little like banana bread, which is good.

High quality and different from the typical fare (mahi, short rib, tempura shrimp among many other choices).

Enter Hopdoddy.  Friend had the Magic Shroom, I had the Classic with a veggie patty. We split a large order of fries and she got a Chocolate Covered Pretzel Mlikshake. MMMMM.\\n\\nThis place has got their order process down pat - you walk in, order your adult beverages/milkshakes, then you order your burger and you're given a table. No awkward lingering looks to see if that table of four is almost done with their food here, nope - just walk over to the table with your name on it.  Food arrives quickly and service is friendly.\\n\\nThe veggie burger is one of the better ones I've had in Austin - it was great with the Sassy Sauce, but can fall juuuuust a little short on its own.  Friend couldn't stop raving about her Magic Shroom burger - I'm assuming it was magnificent.  The fries were delicious and the one thing I will DEFINITELY be back for is the MILKSHAKES.  It was DELICIOUS.  I'll definitely be back this summer to have one of those as I trek along South Congress.\\n\\nOverall, one of the better burger places I've been to in Austin - you shouldn't let the line discourage you... and by the time you're done reading this short novel, you may even be in the door.

If you don't care about the uniqueness of the venue, or if you're not staying to eat in, you could probably find a decent burger elsewhere.\\n\\nDetailed Review:\\nAs always, I like to remind anyone reading my reviews that 3 Stars is technically \\"Good\\" on Yelp's scale.  I don't like to inflate reviews if I'm not truly wowed.\\n\\nFirst, the line: it's really long.  I was here in August, so it was hot outside.  The line moves slowly, and apparently, they only let people in as tables are available.  I'm not sure how they accommodate orders to go, so I can't comment.  The management thoughtfully provided flavored water (cucumber and lemon, if memory serves) so that you wouldn't dehydrate while you awaited your order.\\n\\nSecond, the ordering process: you order drinks (beer or mixed drinks) before you order food.  So that's a plus, since you're probably going to be thirsty unless you sucked down some water outside.  BUT - you're still in line, technically speaking, so... yeah.\\n\\nThird, menu: good selection of interesting burgers.  I honestly don't remember what I ordered, but it was good.  Not great.  No complaints, though - I ate it greedily.  Some of our party memorably ordered the Haba√±ero burger (Diablo or something), and seemed to like it (even if it was painful for one or two of them).\\n\\nFourth, the service: excellent!

The food looked like art on a plate and most of the plates tasted wonderful.\\n\\nThe Bad: So I went here with a party of 5 and we ordered the entire menu AND all of the specials, and doubles of our favorite 8 dishes, and our waiter said this would be enough food. We're normal sized people (all looking pretty decent in a bikini) and weren't especially staving. We also ate some cheese and noms at the restaurant next door. After $600++ we all left hungry. I normally wouldn't have a problem with this, other than the fact that we arrived at 5pm and had to wait 2 hours. PLEASE NOTE: here, I mean that the food was good, but the wait staff should have recommended more food. I loved most of the dishes, but it was apparent that the kitchen staff smokes: some plates were so salty they blew my palate (the duck was the worst offender). Also, when we got there at 5pm, there were 6 empty tables but we couldn't have any of them for some reason even though they don't take reservations. Whatever, I'm still not impressed with the food.\\n\\nSuggestions: Go early and eat some cheese next door while you wait for your table. Don't go with high expectations: you will be disappointed or lying to yourself about the end result.

I understand Moto of Chicago, and Fat Duck of London, but I don't think this is good enough to act that damn pretentious about it. Half of it was a great food experience, half of it was over salted.

I've been here twice and got the 2 pieces white meat plate with the cole slaw, seasoned fries and fried rice. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and fried. It came out juicy hot and not dried like other fried chicken places. The seasoning is lightly spicy so it's perfect for someone who doesn't eat spicy but still want that kick in flavor. The cole slaw is cream based and the seasoned fries are thick fries. The fried rice is similar to the Chinese take out fried rice so I thought that was kinda weird since I'm at a southern fried chicken place. Overall this place is awesome for fried chicken.

Not the case today. I headed over to the South Congress location after craving a HD burger for days, and mind you this is a burger that I've raved about as my FAVORITE burger literally around the world, and I am sorely disappointed. In the past, burgers were advertised as 100% grass fed beef...awesome. Well not anymore, now it's an OPTION for an additional 2 bucks! Even worse, the even now more expensive burger that I fell for ordering, which I ordered medium, came out very well done, dry and chewy. So long to the wonderfully buttery and juicy burger I had been craving. And yes I realize that this is partly due to it being a leaner grassfed product, but this poor piece of meat was mutilated by the kitchen. Apparently, as with most businesses, expansion has hurt HD's attention to detail and quality of product, and with two locations in atx and one now in Dallas, this is apparently the case. I sure hope the owners read these reviews. I can no longer call you my favorite, dear hop doddy, nor will I recommend you to the masses of people I previously have.

Especially since so many reviews indicate the opposite.\\n\\nMost recently I got an order of spaghetti and meatballs to go and after waiting for it to be made, which took nearly ten minutes, I left the store with an aluminum plate full of pasta and chopped up meatballs. The plate was placed inside of a paperbag and they gave me a paper plate to insulate my hands from the heat. Needless to say that  I didn't walk one hundred yards before I burnt myself and before the spaghetti sauce made it's way through the paper bag and onto my jacket. Pissed.\\n\\nBut no big deal, I was hungry and when I got to the office a minute later, cleaned up and decided to take a bite of my dish I found it to be absolutely disgusting. The pasta was unseasoned, overcooked and the meatballs were far from juicy, moist, tender and flavorful. Instead I had these hard lumps of mystery meat that were served on top of this crappy pasta. It was by far the worst plate of spaghetti and meatballs that I've ever had. The small piece of bread which was a bit dry and which came with it was almost like adding salt to my wounds. I wouldn't even dare serve that kind of dish to a dog. Now I have to sit there and hope that I don't get sick from this...\\n\\nHonestly this is hugely disappointing and on top of that their minimum to pay by card is $20, and their service isn't even friendly. \\n\\nI cannot in my own, right mind give this place anything above a one star - a star that stands for mediocre food, mediocre service and mediocre execution.

But honestly, it's the single most overlooked ingredient in great food and something in our modern day and age we don't appreciate like they used (i.e. middle ages or something).\\n\\nAt any rate, Hop Doddy's Bread is amazing. I've been back hear about 5-6 times now, but I will never forget the first time I came. I walked in and the aroma of pancakes filled my nostrils. My olfactory was telling me that I'm at a mid-end pancake factory, but no that was the sweet scent of their buns rising in the ovens. So, yes the bread is top notch. It's sweet, light, and fluffy, almost like challah but not that light.\\n\\nNow the meat is tremendous as well. The portions are generous. The cooking is consistent, usually but with exception, to how you order it. And it's of generally high quality. You could totally order a basic burger and be set. \\n\\nThe menu though is really where things get interesting. I've tried now about half of it, but it seems like there's something for everyone. Now I do have to recommend The Diablo, if you're like me and like spicy flavors. I must warn you, this burger means business (it has Habanero slices), but it's the best buger I've had there so far. Though there is a new all angus beef burger that I have yet to try. \\n\\nLastly, really what's important to stress about this place, besides the bread, is just the overall package. They serve Live Oak beer, which is some of the best beer in the country, let alone in the city, in gigantic glasses. I don't know what the actual measurement is but trust me, a $5 beer there is much better deal than a $4 beer somewhere else. But besides that, the place has a sleek elagent So-Co look to it, fitting with the general vibe of fine dining in the area, offers down to earth good cooking at prices that are available to everyone, varied menu in accordance to the level of exotic ingredients you want, and in general really has it all.\\n\\nNote: I would like to make one grievance.

That sounds like a bad line from a song, but whatever, it's the best fried chicken I've ever eaten. The batter that they use is much saltier than any other batter I've had (in a very good way), and on the rare occasion of getting it fresh, the chicken is hot and juicy. \\n\\nMy dad says this place is famous for effing up your order... yes, they are. I remember going through a drive through and later seeing they gave me the SPICY (too bloody hot to eat) and I screamed \\"I HATE POPEYES!!!\\"... It's a love hate relationship I guess. \\n\\nThey're also famous for making you wait \\"two minutes\\" like Jodi E. said, when in fact its probably 10 minutes. But I'm always happy to wait, because that means they're actually MAKING it and it'll be hot and juicy! \\n\\nHowever, I also live by here, so I've been in and out multiple times. If I'd only been once and they gave me the wrong order and it was cold I'd say screw them. But I've developed a relationship over time, and it's turned into a sweet sweet love that my father will never understand. \\n\\nFor a while I ventured to Church's and other fried chicken places but they weren't anywhere close to the flavor that Popeyes offers, even when it's cold... haha\\n\\nSo be warned by all these horrible things that Popeyes is also famous for... but if you're really wanting some fried chicken, check your order once they give it to you... and maybe maybe you'll be happy. \\n\\nI always get the chicken strips.

But as for this time I came in Saturday night today, I came out sort of disappointed. I was expecting that juicy and thick double Shack Burger I always love to bite into, but today my burger was burned especially the edges, which were like 90% burned...The too patty seemed way smaller than the first for some reason. At least the lettuce and tomato looked very stylish and fresh as always, so there's a plus. I got cheese fries with it and boy the are amazing!!!! The cheese was like custard in terms of desserts, very thick and more tart than tangy, so good. Service excellent... All in all, everything was amazing other than that burned burger I had :( . I drive about 35 minutes to come to Shake Shack and I'm always so eager during the car ride, took half an L today but hope to be back.

Just ate a Shroom Burger and Chick'n Shack... Both very good but I don't really like mushrooms so I didn't see the logic of my getting the Shroom Burger...but gotta try new things. The Chick'n Shack was unbelievable, fried chicken sandwich and the thing is that the fried layer does not make you feel rotten and hungover like other places. Very healthy. Atmosphere is unbelievable, moderate noise, hustle and bustle at Perimeter Mall...makes you feel great. \\n\\n\\nUpdated Review: Visit on March 18th; 2018. \\n\\nCame back to Shake Shack yet again, for my seventh time...it's that good! Stopped for a very quick to go order, and was impressed by not only how fast they prepared my Double Shack Burger, but also the quality of it. They made that thang in 6 minutes! Now most burger places who are fast tend to give up quality, but Shake Shack cooks fresh every time...so no worries about quality here. Took my first bite, oh my...the entry into the potato bun was just mesmerizing. So soft and tasting like that great potato roll taste. Level 2 of the Burger, I sensed the shack sauce all inside my mouth and the burger, really compliments the hot and tender beef patties. These beef patties folks, I promise to you...they taste better than any other burger place in Georgia...i can't describe with words so I recommend you give it a shot! $8.39 for a Double Shack Burger but well WELL worth it I guarantee.

The tandoori shrimp on the other hand, I would pass on in the future. It arrived cold, rubbery, and didn't have much taste to it.

That said this review would be more for those types of people trying Pattycake Bakery for the first time.  \\n\\nThis month we bought two cakes on two different occasions to accommodate some food sensitives and a vegan plus a few cookies just to try them out.  I have nothing to compare these cakes to other than the traditional cake one would make or buy at the store.   The first thing you'll notice is the colors.  I don't know if it is the Pattycake Bakery style or indicative of vegan bakery but the colors were off; not quite white, not quite brown; not quite blue; etc.  But color's just color and what matters most is the taste.  The cakes were very dense more like a pound cake or a brownie.  The cake was moist with a small granular texture.  As far as taste both cakes were very very sweet.  I suspect the granular texture was the sugar that wasn't able to dissolve because of the over saturation.    I couldn't detect that much of the vanilla flavors or chocolate flavors as they were a lot more subtle than traditional cakes.   I could hardly taste the chocolate in the double chocolate cookie.  So I can only assume that vegan baking usually has muted flavors compared to traditional baking.  The desserts were however a hit, and I would use Pattycake Bakery again when/if I have the need.\\n\\nTL:DR Cakes from Pattycake Bakery are good (for vegan)."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Terry Black's is alright.

I ordered it made with soy paper. and asked them to make it \\n\\nI must say, with every sushi meal that I have been having, i am becoming a big fan of the Soy paper rolls. They make the roll so much more lighter and refreshing at the same time. It costs a buck or 2 more. But nothing beats the taste. And then, it also leaves room for something else that you would like to indulge in. Like my favorite Mochi Ice Cream - Mango!!\\n\\nI love that Fuji 1546 has such a long bar. Wish more places had an ambiance like it. Although I never have a cocktail on a weekday - for lunch (to be very clear - lol) I like to sit at the bar. That feeling is just right. This restaurant gets high points from me for just the right ambiance. No matter what the time of the day or night, you will always find a spot here depending on your company and your mood. The main dining area is reasonably big and has enough space to go as a big group or just with a friend or two.\\n\\nThe waiting staff is good and very friendly. Now anyone who has been to Taiyo once will swear by how good the staff here at Fuji is :-)\\n\\nMy ratings for this must go Japanese restaurant in Quincy Ctr:\\nFood: 5/5\\nAmbiance: 4/5\\nService: 4/5\\nPrice: 4/5\\nOverall: 4.5 out of 5\\n\\nLooking forward to more fun lunches and dinners at Fuji 1546!"},{"name":"T'Kilas Tacos & More","address":"1248 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"I went here once a few years ago and said I wouldn't be back.

I guess when someone offers to take you to lunch you really shouldn't complain about where.\\n\\nThe food isn't necessarily bad, it's just generic, cheap non-authentic Mexican food.  I don't have anything against this style of Mexican restaurant but there are quite a few I'd go to before Los Loros.  Both things I ordered (a la carte) were greasy and the salsa was more like a bland tomato sauce.

I am kind of a loser and always claim to be German, although I'm not sure that's actually true.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as most German restaurants in America are want to do, this is a bastardized version of what German food should be.

It's not bad food, it just isn't good food. The green beans mit spaetzle was definitely the highlight. The pork schnitzel was flavorless and depressing. It just didn't taste homemade, it didn't taste like comfort food.\\n\\nYes, the CREAM in the cream puffs is delicious (note: the pastry itself is underwhelming at best), the service was great, the Oompah Band was fun and even knew \\"Ein Prosit\\" when I requested it. He was singing \\"Schnitzelbank\\" when I got there, too, but other than that he was just singing English songs in the style of an Oompah band. The bier selection was great, as it should be.

Just perfect for dunking the last piece of the bun into.

Clean, organized, and slightly over anxious waitstaff. \\n\\nDo they think their s*** doesn't stink? Surely not. They're doing a hamburger the best that they can. Grinding meat in house, fresh beefsteak tomatoes on display even, to baking their buns fresh hourly. Great concept, great staff, decent burger. \\n\\nI ordered 'The Goodnight'. I was looking for a basic burger with just a tiny flourish. Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, BBQ Sauce, and Sassy Sauce...whatever the hell THAT is. Chased by their version of a Bloody Mary- 'Hey Neighbor'.\\n\\nOut she comes, just mouth dropping beautiful. These guys definitely have the build down. Perfect layering, glistening bun..just wow. I was kicking myself when the flavors didn't match up. The meat was tasty, but not really beefy/meaty. Cooked a perfect Rare. The Challah bun was dry and the texture just didn't compliment the burger. I got all the way to the last bite before I actually tasted the BBQ sauce. Silly me, I thought paying a dollar over the base burger would have atleast gotten me more than a smidge of BBQ sauce. While the sauce was soaked up into the bun, lending the bun the moisture that it so desperately needed, it was completely lost on me.\\n\\nThe 'Hey Neighbor' was alright. Nifty little concoction- loaded with alcohol. My problem is that they  should probably let this drink stand on its own and not compare it to a bloody mary. It didn't hit the meaty and spicy note that a tomato based bloody mary delivers. \\n\\nBAck to the burger- it left me with the impression of it being 'alright'. I kept thinking of how beautiful it was, the spiffy window where I could watch a man fresh grinding the chuck- great showmanship, but not once did a thought cross my mind that said it was delicious, or even worth another trip out. It was just a plain jane waterloo-caliber burger dressed up to go out on the town and fool people into thinking it tastes better than it truly does. You're taking ALL these awesome steps, Hopdoddy, but delivering a mediocre *tasting* burger. \\n\\nI'm actually a little sad at how underwhelmed I now find myself- even without any preconceived notions!

My wife and I stopped in here for the second time, but the first time was about 3 years ago before we moved out of the neighborhood. We just recently moved back and wanted to find a good alternative for brunch that's close and NOT Denny's. \\n\\nWhen going to an old style diner, you should expect it's gonna be exactly that, and not the typical Portland hipster place with organic gluten free free range whatever. This place is the kind of place your grandma used to go to. You walk in and seat yourself and the waitress came with coffee very quickly. We think we were the only ones in the place under 60 on a Monday morning, but that's ok and we like the small town feel. \\n\\nWe LOVE American breakfast. It's something I could eat every day any time of day. I was hard pressed deciding between the chicken fried steak and the ranch breakfast, but wanted to try the biscuits and gravy and breakfast potatoes. The eggs were over easy as I like them, sausage patty was nothing special, but was obviously made by hand. The biscuit and gravy was pretty good. Much much better than anything you'd get at Denny's. The biscuits are home made and flaky and delicious. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite! I like them crispy and most diners serve potatoes undercooked.\\n\\nMy wife got the diced ham and eggs with hash browns. They let you sub your toast for a biscuit for free and she loved that too. They give you this yummy homemade raspberry jam to put on it. Her eggs were really good, almost more ham than eggs! Hash browns were perfectly golden brown and crispy, not this slathered in butter raw in the center garbage you get at Denny's. They let my wife switch to hot chocolate for free from her coffee.\\n\\nCoffee was pretty weak, but they are probably used to older people who can't tell. I usually drink it black and expect it to be strong. Might have just been an off day though. The service was great. The food was very good for the price. $7-$9 for those large portions is great. It's not Black Bear Diner crazy portions, which I appreciate. I'd like to live at least another ten years thank-you-very-much. \\n\\nWe will definitely be returning.

The menu was on a piece of paper where you tick off the items you want. For drinks, we decided to get their house-made soda. I got the raspberry-lychee flavor and it was delicious!\\n\\nFor food, we got the Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles, 2 baos (one braised beef, one pork belly), Sriracha corn, edamame wasabi dumplings, and kimchi quinoa bokkeumbap. My favorites were the dumpling, noodles, and quinoa. I wasn't impressed by the baos, you can get much better in Chinatown, and there didn't seem to be much of a fusion twist. I felt I could make the Sriracha corn myself. It just tasted like spicy buttered corn. $6 is a little steep for one ear of corn.\\n\\nI loved the dumplings, the wasabi and edamame is a surprisingly good combination. You can get Dan Dan Noodles anywhere, but here you can definitely taste the fusion. I definitely recommend it in addition to the quinoa. Both dishes were very flavorful and all the ingredients seem like a happy marriage. My only complaint is that the food is very greasy. I wish they used less oil, but maybe less oil = less tasty?\\n\\nYou would expect the dessert here to be good because Joanne Chang of Flour Bakery owns this place, right?

Only deserves 2 stars for strictly the pizza, but we added 1 star to give the new owner the benefit of doubt.\\n\\nWe're biased, because we thought the old Pyro Pizza was among the best pizza in Portland, up there with Scottie's. It breaks our hearts to say it, but the new Paper Bag Pizza just isn't as good. Not even close. It's OK, and if you've never had Pyro Pizza you might even like it better. But it's just not the same.\\n\\nCompared to the old Pyro Pizza: the crust is even thinner. It burns much more easily. It's one thing to have charred pizza, but burned is a step too far.\\n\\nThe sauce is also more watery. This makes the crust alternate between coal-black burned parts with soggy parts from the thin, watery sauce. A few bites were just right, but not many. \\n\\nThe outer edge of the crust, being thicker, was OK - but a good pizza has to be much more than just the edge of the crust.\\n\\nThe rest of the toppings, we're not sure. Paper Bag doesn't have our old favorite, the Margherita pie, so it's hard to compare. There were fewer mushrooms than before. The all-important mozzarella cheese wasn't the same as before, but we couldn't tell if it's a different kind, or just burned a little closer to plastic consistency (and taste).\\n\\nIt might *look* like the old Pyro Pizza, but it doesn't taste like it. It's kind of an amusement park caricature of its old self (even if it comes out of the same oven).\\n\\nOverall, it's not a bad pizza, but, not a good one either.

It was a little creepy, but perfectly sized for me, since my head *just* cleared the entrance and ceiling. Also saw the upstairs since that is where the bathroom is located. The whole place is very warm, sort of dim...I feel like you could get away with dressing up a bit here but also felt comfortable enough you could show up in flip flops.\\n\\nWe had reservations and were seated quickly. We checked in on Yelp and used our free app to order mussels which came right out. (Sadly, the rest of our food didn't arrive til ages later. Like, getting awkward, waitress stopping by to apologize later. It seemed as though a giant table ahd arrived just before us so perhaps that was it.) It was easy to pick the app (the most expensive, duh ;-) but meal choice was harder. the menu is HUGE! Tons of options, including lots of vegetarian ones. \\n\\nAnywho, the food was worth waiting for, everything I tried was excellent (including the aforementioned mussels btw, I encourage those who might shy away from shellfish to dive in). I went with Tikki Masala figuring I would stick with something basic. Good stuff. I tried some of the lamb and also the goat dish, both great. My favorite sauce might have been the Korma which my girlfriend had on the side just for dipping. I would eat this for dessert! \\n\\nUnfortunately I cannot comment on cocktails or naan. How is this possible you ask!? For some health reasons I'm opting out of grains and booze right now so I had to pass. I can only imagine how either (or both) would have enhanced my meal, so I definitely will return to try. \\n\\nI'd been told for years this was the best Indian food in Austin. Granted my experiences are very limited, but heck, I'd agree."},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Whatever you're doing, Xian- keep it up!

But at Blue Star Donuts that is not the case, nor is it overpowering in sweetness.  \\n\\nIf your a doughnut lovers then i highly suggest visiting one of their locations, but if you aren't able to visit for some unforeseen reason don't fret, they have a location located at PDX airport.

No party in the mouth from flavors blending if you know what I mean. May have been from the lack of robustness and acidity of the sauce, also not much of that sauce so it was dry, for $2 more :(.

The walnut cream wasn't too strong.  I could only taste it when eating with the bread.  The sour cabbage was too strong to match with the rest.  On the other side, the sour apple was fine with the perfect amount of sourness.  The walnut was just there for the texture.\\nfoccacia, eggplant-spaghetti, burrata 3/5 - It was way too salty.  Luckily the burrata was plain to balance that.\\nnettle, scarpinocc stuffed with nettle, ricotta, parmesan, brown butter sauce 4/5 - the pasta was al-dente.  The cheese was stronger than regular ricotta and parmesan but still tolerable.  \\nlinguine, cod, tomato, parsley 3/5 - Much saltier than the last pasta.  Much like a linguine alla puttanesca.

The sauce was not too special either.\\nherb crusted chicken breast, leeks puree, dandelion, brussels 3.5/5 - It was a big disappointment when I saw this dish.  I was expecting beef, pork, or seafood (something more that chicken breast).  Luckily, the chicken was juicy.  The green pasto on top was a little too salty.

It did not look that light at all.  There was no hint of chestnuts and they were used to make the cake fluffy.    The sorbet was refreshing but nothing special.  The chocolate salami was a chocolate and hazelnuts.  Too bad the hazelnuts tasted stale.  The almond tart was very flakey.  It wasn't too sweet and the tart itself was buttery.\\nService 3.5/5 - Our sever came and checked on us on every dishes.

I've been here multiple times and each time--I love it more and more.  There always seems to be a 20-30 min. line for the tables, so my bf and I always sneak to the bar and grab seats if we can. I think we've waited 5 minutes max for someone to leave the bar.  They could use some kind of reservation system.\\n\\nWhat makes this place great? The neighborhood feel to it.  Its a pretty small and intimate restaurant, and during the summer, they add the patio, which is very nice and the restaurant opens up a bit.  Located right on Boylston before the Gardens, you get to do a fair amount of people watching if you are sitting outside.  During the summer/fall time, we've also ordered to take out and head up to the Gardens or the Common and have a little picnic. It is so convenient and the food is great.\\n\\nWhat's good here? The hummus is eh-okay. You could probably find better hummus at your local grocery store.  The Vegetarian Corn Cakes are 2 beefy patties of corn cake heaven.  They are delicious and probably my favorite app here.  The Onion Rings are good, but so greasy. I can feel my arteries clogging up with each bite, but they do the trick to appease the hangover.  And those are just the starters.\\n\\nThe Tuna Nicoise Salad is pretty good.  They do not short you on the tuna and its served rare and seared. slightly  The lemon dressing is not overpowering and gives it just a hint of tartness which goes very well with the tuna.  My favorite sandwich is a toss-up between the egg sandwich lyonnaise and the Clear Flour BLT (which is currently not on the menu but I've been told that it will make an appearance shortly).  The Egg Sandwich Lyonnaise is a mix between Eggs Benedict (my fave) and a BLT (minus the lettuce). It is savory and so filling that I couldn't even finish the potato salad which is equally amazing.  I always push to finish the sandwich because it is THAT good.  The Clear Flour BLT is great in its basic qualities.  The Baked Mac N'Cheese is just okay--I mean, I'm not going to say no to it if it was in front me, but it's not my first order choice either but I always get a mean stomach ache from the mac n'cheese and the onion rings.  The Meatloaf sandwich is exactly as it sounds, two slices of meatloaf bread slices. My friend couldn't even finish it because it was so filling.\\n\\nThe other great thing about Parish--they have this beer club thing. You sign a card and you have a year from when you sign it to complete the 76 beers listed on the back of the card. With each sitting, you can order 4 beers and the servers sign off on it.  The servers are great in recommending and describing the beers.  If you finish your list within the year timeframe, you get one of the mugs hanging on the ceiling with your name and whatever saying or quote you want.  Why is this so great? Well, once you are a part of \\"the club,\\" anytime you order a beer, instead of getting it served in just a normal pint glass, you get it served in your mug which gives you 5 extra ounces, but its the same price as the normal pint glass.

In my opinion, it's the second best in town. I've tried Miichi Ramen, Kome (lunch ramen), a few others... but I end up going here way more often than Ramen Tatsa-Yu because I generally don't have to wait to get a table here, it's close to my place and if someone doesn't want ramen, they have other stuff too. I always add the spicy chili oil, and black vinegar to my ramen as well. \\n\\nFor the rest of the menu, the dan-dan noodles are spectacular if you don't want ramen. The sushi is pretty good, just depends on the day. \\n\\nOh, before you leave, don't forget to check out the chefs making the noodles (toward the back), it's amazing to watch them. They take one piece of dough and turn it into 128 individual noodles in about 15 seconds.

I had to try some of their more unique flavors, so we opted for two waffles with the lavender milk chocolate and the white chocolate pistachio rosewater toppings. The latter was, again, a bit too sweet for me, but everything was delicious nonetheless.\\n\\nFor something more substantial, we ordered the fricass√©, which came out in a giant skillet chock full of meat, veggies, and topped with a sunnyside-up egg. Totally nomworthy, and the best part is using the French toast that comes with it to soak up all of the juices and sauce at the end that remains in the skillet. Yummmm.\\n\\nThe only downside to this adorable place is the wait. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes for a table (if you're a less patient person and have 1-2 in your party, you can ask the host if there are bar seats available), but if you can make it past that, the food will be well worth it."},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Render is a small, charming coffeehouse near the Mass Ave T stop.

I only went for dinner one night because the typically long line was nowhere to be seen, so I figured it was the best time to try it out. Usually the line is out the door and around the corner (I always figured this said something about the food). The restaurant has an interesting concept and has a young feel (funny, because I went with grandparents. Though they enjoyed it a lot too). They way you order is funny, but it is well explained and the staff was very attentive and made it clear and easy. I won't go into detail because I think it is covered by other reviews (and it's easy and clear, like I said). The veggie burger is really good. It's a fairly soft burger, and will likely fall apart a little bit, but not enough to make it a hassle. It was a good blend of flavors and textures, and most of all it tasted really fresh. I could tell the ingredients were high quality. Definitely worth a try if you like burgers, but appreciate the more complex variety. If you just like plain ole MacDo-style cheeseburgers you might not like or appreciate the variety of burgers they have here.

I said never mind and I would just take the birthday cake to the table.\\n\\nOur food took an unusually long time to be brought out to us. We watched numerous other tables sit down after us and be served their food well before we received ours. The restaurant was busy, but not packed. There were plenty of servers lollygagging around the patio and blowing bubbles, instead of doing their job...which is even more frustrating when you are currently being ignored and experiencing terrible service. \\n\\nEverything arrived cold. It was pretty apparent our food had been forgotten and had been sitting out for a while. The truffle fries, which are always good, were terrible and cold....they did not taste fresh at all. \\nOne of the sandwiches was supposed to be served with sliced pickles, and instead received a side of pickle ends...literally just the stems.  When my co-worker asked if she could have more pickles, that were actually slices, she just got a stare. \\nMy salad came with no dressing and was smaller than a side salad and certainly not worthy of $8. \\n\\nWe waited about 20 minutes to have food boxed up and then had to wait for our checks.

The fried okra is very good - crispy, not too greasy, and seasoned just fine without needing to add salt. The chicken pieces are smallish, but the taste makes up for that. The macaroni is good, not great, but good. It tastes like it is definitely made with processed cheese and not in the southern style of a flour and butter roux, but it is better than the kind made with those little powder pouches (for reference).

The Nantucket bay scallops were sauteed and split in the middle, served on a pea puree.  The meaty grilled octopus drizzled with a vinaigrette had good flavor.

My husband and I waited patiently thinking that our salads would be out shortly.  15 minutes pass, 25 minutes pass and finally I asked the server what happened to the salads?  She told me they come out with the food.  Really?  The couple across from us got there soup and salad together.  Finally, after a blustery 40 minute wait, we received our entrees.  The gyoza, spring rolls, and tempura were all cold and mushy from the oil they had been fried in.  I took a bite of the tempura and I got a large gulp of oil.  Really disgusting.  The salad was a few leaves of lettuce, tomato slice, and one piece of broccoli with a vinegar dressing.  It was a sloppy mess and lacked flavor.  There was only ONE server and the bartender running the whole show.  The server was nice but not once did she come to ask us how everything was, did we need anything, or even refill the waters.

The young lady that brought us our placesettings and water was wearing pearls. Very nice touch. The actual waitress was respectful, knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely efficient. We needed three seperate checks, not a problem. We ordered vastly different meals, not a problem. She had umpteen other tables yet we felt as though we were her only one.

The broth was rich in flavor the onions still had body the crustini was perfect and easy to break through and the cheeses was crisp on the crock. Perfection. The salad was fresh and crisp,personal preference I would've like to have seen a little more tomato . But good. The lobster pie. Now here we must pause for a moment of silence. In remembrance of another restaurant that has closed but was the period at the end of the lobster pie sentence. I will always judge lobster pie against this fond memory which probably isn't fair but,  I am a private citizen and I don't have to be fair just honest. The lobster pie here was good.

I also found my new favorite beer the Live Oak HefeWeizen. I got this from their website: HefeWeizen has a cloudy, straw-colored appearance with a thick, creamy head. It is fermented with an authentic Weizenbier yeast strain which imparts delicate notes of clove, vanilla and banana which harmonize perfectly with its mild refreshing tartness. Together these flavors create the perfect thirst quencher to beat the Texas heat. THE BEST BEER.\\n\\nThe burgers were so goooooood! I got the Primetime burger which the beef patty was soft and worked so good with the creamy brie cheese and truffled aioli. My cousin had the special burger of the day which had blue cheese and fried onions. It was the best. so freakin delicious and their buns or magical. I could smother their buns all over my face. or use it as a pillow while sleeping. All the ingredients taste so fresh. This place reminds me of Shake Shack in New York City but with more variety of burgers. \\n\\nThe fries are not bad I just got large the Kennebec Fries. It was ok but paired really well with the amazing burgers they served up. \\n\\nI love the system they have when ordering. You fall in line and they take your order  in the back and then they give you a number which corresponds with a table number like assigned seating. You go to the table and they bring your food to you. And if it is busy you just have to  wait outside until you are able to order.

We were there for the entire experience, not just the food, so we give it 3 stars. The endless jars of pickled vegetables gave it more of a feel of a Cracker Barrel or a grandmother's basement than a sophisticated new Austin restaurant- I mean I LOVE pickling and displaying jars myself but it should not be the main decor. We were seated on the patio first and felt like we were sitting in a parking lot on Burnet- because we were. A simple metal screen  (like Bull Fight) would enhance the patio's decor, separate it from the traffic and block the sun. We moved to the bar when a spot opened up and were so excited to be there that we plopped down with giddy smiles and said hello to the male bartender to which we got no response. This is a small bar so it was impossible to miss us. He finally got around to asking us if we wanted a drink, errr yeah, and was so unenthusiastic about explaining any of the cocktails. He was just completely uninterested. We decided that something must have happened to his dog because nobody in this industry in Austin is not friendly. We ordered some shared plates and they were delicious, yet small, of course we know where we are. I just think each could have a couple more bites. We just got such a lousy experience that we decided to leave instead of ordering entrees. He finally sensed this and topped off our wine and tried to make an effort, but we were just done with the whole thing. No one should have to make an effort to have a good time when you are paying Austin prices.  I have to say that I much prefer to speak with the server or management instead of resorting to Yelp for a negative review but it was just too awkward.

The first time I came it was at an off hour so there was only a short line and my experience was overall very good.  The ahi burger was delish, so that's what I came back for.\\n\\nFor those who have never been, you should prepare yourself for the system by which you procure food at this establishment.  If you're not prepared for it, or if you were under the impression that they have table service, you should be forewarned.   \\n\\nI'm the kind of person who likes to know that, when I walk into a restaurant with a wacky ordering process, there is someone in charge who has it all under control and that it'll all be handled in an organized and fair fashion. \\n\\nSo here's how it works at HopDoddy.  You walk in and queue up.  You can see how many people are in front of you so you can judge how long it should take to make your way to the ordering counter.  Someone comes up at some point while you stand in line and they assign a table number to you.  This gives you confidence that there will, in fact, be a place for you to sit when you finally get your food.  Sounds organized and reasonable so far.\\n\\nSo we are standing in line for about 10 minutes and there are at this point only about 10 more people in front of us.  Not bad.  We figure another 5 -10 mins (15 - 20 minutes total) and we'll be ordering, and then we can go sit down and it'll probably be another 5 - 10 mins for our food to be delivered.  \\n\\nThat's how it should have worked.  But wait, what's this?  Another couple walks in and it turns out they are with the guy in front of us.   A few minutes later, 4 more people show up and, guess what?  They're friends of that guy also.  Now 3 more friends of that dude show up.  The line in front of us is getting longer and longer.  We're getting super annoyed and thinking of the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where Larry gets accused of doing a \\"chat and cut\\" at the Pinkberry.   Are all these people doing a chat and cut?  Then I guess they see us shooting daggers at them with our eyes and one of them comes over and says they are a party of 16 and they have 6 more people parking their car and coming in.\\n\\nOkay, I'm super annoyed, and super hungry (read: cranky) about now.  Hopdoddy, I get it, they had a large party, but it's not fair to all the people behind them on line, who walked in and judged their wait based on the bodies they saw in front of them, to then have 16 more people show up with no wait at all and jump in line ahead of us.   I really think this is a FUBAR policy.  If you have a huge party like this, you should have to wait till everyone arrives and then get in line with your 16 bodies.  I'm not saying you have to do it for every party of 2 that walks in, but 16 people????   Come on!!  Is there anyone on planet earth who wouldn't think that was amazingly rude? \\n\\nAnyway, I thought I could rise above my annoyance but then when the hostess came over and assigned me a table right along the side where the line stands, I just couldn't deal.  After my 20 minute wait in line was about to turn into a 40 minute wait, and I had the prospect of a crummy table waiting for me at the end of the rainbow, I had to blow out of there and head down the street to Doc's.    It was very disappointing.  Not sure if I can deal with this place again unless it happens to be an off hour with a light crowd."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is an upscale seafood restaurant near a lovely shopping center.

I'm back and finally made it!  Seems we have a serious contender for good Thai food in Vancouver finally!  Yeah!\\n\\nStarted off with the Thai sausages which are made in house.  The quality of the meat was quite high, and they arrived with a nice char presented with some greens and a Thai chili sauce.  The sausages themselves were of high quality, but I would have liked a bit more seasoning, and perhaps letting them ferment just a bit longer.  Thankfully the sauce rounded out the flavour nicely.\\n\\nFollowed with the pad gapao gai (chicken with holy basil).  The chicken was perfectly tender and browned to keep in the juices.  The basil had been flash fried to get slightly crispy before being added to the stir fry.  This was a lovely dish with just a hint of spice.  It needed a bit more heat for my taste as well, and they happily provided 2 additional sauces upon request.  One was a chili jam, and the other was exactly what was needed - a mixture of lime juice, diced Thai bird peppers, fish sauce, and a bit of sugar.  By adding the magic sauce the dish tasted perfect to me!  I was a happy camper.  \\n\\nThe key to Thai food in my mind is that balance between sweet, salty, sour, and spicy.  That magic sauce had it perfectly balanced - which is something I haven't found in Vancouver before!  The chef's skill came through quite clearly with that sauce!\\n\\nSo I'm pretty happy with Maenam so far.  Basically things are toned down for a Kits palate, but they have the \\"right\\" balance available upon request.\\n\\nIf I could give one bit of humble advice to the kitchen - perhaps ask how spicy the customer would like the dish (and then balance things out appropriately for the sweet, sour, and salty as it is clear you know how to do) so that everyone is happy straightaway - or automatically offer the \\"magic sauce\\" to add.  If someone doesn't ask they might wander away thinking it was too \\"fusion\\" or \\"Canadian\\" for their taste.  \\n\\nWhile I miss Gastropod, Maenam is an excellent addition to the Vancouver dining scene, and I wish them well.  I will definitely be returning and telling my friends (and encouraging them to ask for the extra spice and seasoning as well!)!"},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious turkish mediterranean food.

I hate to do this, but I have to downgrade Hopdoddy.  Went back today to discover that the Janis Joplin, i.e. one of only two vegetarian burgers, was recently taken off the menu.  Now, the only veg-friendly thing (aside from two very creative  salad choices, neither of which appealed) is a Mexican-themed black bean/corn situation.   No thanks - If we wanted Mexican food, we'd just go next door to Guero's.  I honestly don't know what they were thinking by doing that... vegetarians/vegans are pretty common in Austin, so they're alienating a potentially lucrative sector of the market.  I get that it's a burger joint, but if they're only going to have one choice for everyone who doesn't eat meat, why have any at all?  Who wants to go to a restaurant where there's only one thing on the menu?  The cashier said a lot of customers were very upset, and it's no surprise.  I ended up not ordering anything, so I sat there with my best friend and cousin, feeling ridiculous as they had lunch.  He had the Bandito veggie burger and it literally fell apart - I mean half of slipped right out of the bun and dropped onto the dish - before he even took a bite.  Ridiculous.   Carnivores may love it, but considering the hectic environment,  tight table spacing, noise levels, etc., it is just not a fun experience in general.\\n\\nFrom my original review:\\nMy cousin moved to town recently and his friend recommended Hopdoddy.  He's a vegetarian and I'm a vegan, so I didn't know what to expect, but they actually had some decent options.  Yes, the setup is odd (bar in the way as you come in?  huh?), curiously high tables that are too close together, which doesn't make for super conversation when a line of customers is streaming past.  It can get noisy and distracting, so I'm not sure what the logic is there.  The food is on the pricey side but generally pretty good - though my veggie burger was way undercooked.  Maybe next time I'll have better luck."},{"name":"Krystal","address":"11052 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Took my son there today around 1 PM and ordered 2 spicy chicken Krystal's thru the drive-thru.. he took a bite out of the one sandwich and it was cold, I circle back around and gave it to the girl at the window who had an attitude.

I didn't have enough time to custom order one from any place. I wanted to go to a non-chain bakery. I had called a couple places who were either sold out or did not have one available. So I was relieved when I called you guys and you told me you had plenty available. Plus you didn't close until evening so I had time to spare.\\n\\nAt this point, I would've settled for an average red velvet cake just based on the fact that I could get one at such short notice. But even better, when we had it after birthday dinner, everyone was impressed with the quality. Including me! It was just the right amount of flavor and texture.

Much like other establishments like Voodoo and Pips, there's always a line and if there isn't one consider yourself lucky. \\n\\nOnce I walked in the door after waiting about 30mins (seems like lines can average 40+ mins) music was pumping and the staff was jamming out. I LOVED IT. The staff here was oh so friendly and overall just great customer service. The shop itself is well maintained and clean which was a plus as well. \\n\\nWHAT TO GET: I came here for the lemon poppyseed but they were already sold out by the time I got to order (around 11PM on a Saturday). :(\\n\\nI opted for the blueberry & creme brulee and was not disappointed with either. Both donuts were the perfect amount of sweetness without giving me a sugar overload which you might expect based on the flavors. I would say that the creme brulee was definitely my favorite since the crust on the top had a great texture contrast to the donut and the filling inside. The blueberry was also tasty and you can tell that they were fresh and used quality ingredients. \\n\\nTIP: No seating inside so you'll probably have to take your box to go and will have to find seats elsewhere."},{"name":"Gurkha Himalayan Kitchen","address":"1141 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The food was well done.  I had the yak momo and a lamb dish, and would say that the momo were excellent with perfectly flavoured sauces.  Neither was mildly flavoured, though I love heat so I ordered the lamb spicy.  Other people at my table ordered milder meals.  The vegetarians at the table had the qati and the daal, and seemed to rave about it.  I tried a spoonful from their plate and didn't think it was anything particularly mind-blowing, but they had also asked for the spice to be turned down a bit.\\n\\nWhile the outside of the restaurant may look a bit sketchy, I find the inside is quite pleasant.    Its very modestly decorated, but this is a place for honest and delicious food rather than extravagance. \\n\\nI took a star off for the service.  It just took forever to get anyone to come to the table to take our order, to get drinks, to get our bill, you name it, even though there were not many people in the restaurant.  The two servers openly bickered in the dining room as well.  At the end of the evening, one of them ran after my group, chasing us and yelling that we had not left a sufficient amount of money.  When we walked back into the restaurant, and had her re-count what we left, she found she had miscounted (by several $20 bills) and that not only was the amount sufficient, she received a fairly generous tip for relatively lacklustre service.\\n\\nI'll certainly be back for the food, but on a night when I have time for a meal that lasts several hours."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Short version: Great burgers, cold craft beers on tap, lively SoCo location.\\n\\nThe Basics: This was the first time I have eaten here. Met a friend for weekday (Thursday) lunch. Bar seating was full at 11:30 am, but seat opened up quickly (less than 10 minutes). Ordered a pint of (512) Pecan Porter to enjoy while checking out the restaurant and menu and to wait for friend to show up.  There was a very short line for table seating that never got over 15 minutes long in time we were there. Outdoor sidewalk seating in front, as well as bar and table seating inside. We ended up sitting and eating at the bar as a seat opened up just as my friend arrived.  The bar is bright (daytime) open area with good view of rest of restaurant - was a tiny bit crowded on the seating, but nothing too distracting. Crowd was lively and included mostly 20- and 30-something business / casual workers and a few out-of-town visitors. Dress was mostly business casual to casual with a few shorts and t-shirts on some of the college-age diners.  Good music selection playing loud enough to hear as background, but not so loud that it interfered with conversation. General noise level was high, but still allowed conversation between two people or even a small group. Parking (validated) in garage behind the restaurant, or angled, back-in parking on street. Trendy, but not pretentious vibe was in line with typical SoCo venue. Menu is high-end burgers, fries and a few salads. Full bar with small but decent selection of local and craft beers on tap. Menu featured several mixed drinks to try.\\n\\nThe Food: I had the Terlingua burger and shared a large order of fries with my friend. The burger was cooked exactly to medium as ordered. Patty was juicy and tasted very fresh. Toppings included chili, onions, fritos and a nice sauce. The fries were good, but it is just my personal preference for steak-cut vs. the smaller almost shoe-string fries offered here. Due to the small size of the fries a few were actually crispy on ends vs. consistently tender - again, this is just my preference, so if smaller fries are your thing these are good. They offer buffalo, lamb, premium beef and veggie alternatives as well. My friend had the classic burger and shared the large order of fries. He also ordered the milkshake with coffee and beer reduction. His burger was cooked well-done as ordered. He enjoyed the milkshake, but felt it could have had a larger serving size. The coffee/beer could be tasted, but did not overwhelm the ice cream experience. The large order of fries was a little skimpy, so was good thing we were not very hungry.\\n\\nThe Drinks: I had a pint of the (512) Pecan Porter, and there were several other good beers on tap. $6 for the pint. I ordered a Sangrita from the menu to try in case I come back with my wife to see if she might like it. The drink is described as \\"Gold Tequila, Freshly Squeezed Orange and Lime Juices, Pomegranate Grenadine, Served Up with Ancho Chile Salt Rim\\" - sounded good in writing, but execution was literally, and figuratively weak. I understand this is SoCo area, but even so $7 for a highball-size \\"premium\\" drink that was very light on the tequila did not thrill me. Most exciting thing about the drink was the Ancho Chile Salt rim, but that was not enough to make me buy another one or recommend one to anyone else. I think I will stick to the taps on future visits if their other \\"sips\\" are similar.\\n\\nThe Service:  They were busy, but not overly so, though it was a Thursday vs. weekend day or evening. Service was fast and friendly, and I was approached and offered help by several of the staff - top notch. I never felt rushed, though we stayed a little longer than usual for the drinks and to talk. Expect a wait for a table at peak times based on other reviews and what I have observed on weekend \\"flybys\\". Traffic and parking can be a little challenge, so if that is going to ruin your day maybe just go to the strip mall (no knock on this - plenty of good food to be had in Austin with front-door parking). \\n\\nThe Bottom Line: Trendy / Casual / Fun atmosphere, great sidewalk seating for people watching and good food. A beer, high-end burger and fries for $15-$20 / person. You're paying a small premium for SoCo location. Loved the burger, expected better from the bar."},{"name":"Mimi's Cafe","address":"12613 Galleria Cr","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"2.5","text":"I'm not sure what's happened to the other people rating this place, but I sure haven't had the same experience.

I was there at breakfast time but will definitely be trying their lunch/dinner, which I heard is delicious. They serve the Jamaican classics there if you are familiar. \\n\\nThere was only one person serving and checking out so it did take a little while to order. The ackee and saltfish had huge chunks of saltfish in there and the calalloo was not too salty, just like how my mom makes it. There was a lot of oil in the pan, but I asked her to strain it first. It is served with fried dumpling and plantain, or you can ask for yams and boiled banana. They also had Jamaican porridge, patties, and bun n cheese. The best part is that they give you a huge amount of food for about $6-8 depending on what you are getting! They were also nice and friendly. \\n\\nI have been to most of the Jamaican spots in Orlando and Negril is definitely a contender if you are feeling for some Jamaican food.

I have really been putting off writing this review. (If I don't put it on Yelp, maybe it won't be true!)\\n\\nWe had a less-than-stellar experience at Phara's the night of our rehearsal dinner. (25 or so people) \\nI was really pleased with the communication and planning leading up to the night of our event. However, the evening turned out to be a major disappointment. \\n\\nPhara contacted me directly afterwards to ask how the evening went (she was not present). I was hoping to copy and paste my email to her here, but it is too lengthy for Yelp's parameters. So, I'll summarize here:\\n\\n* The \\"private\\" room we were in also had another large party in it that evening, so it was quite crowded and noisy.\\n\\n* We were never given any glasses for water or tea (or our wine), just lots and lots of tiny champagne flutes.  ?? (We were not drinking champagne.)\\n\\n* Phara and I had decided previously that appetizers would come out at 7pm, followed by buffet-style entrees at 7:20. We did not eat until after 9pm! \\n\\n* Food that was finally served was not what we decided on beforehand. Chicken was quite dry and had no sauce or eggplant with it as it should have. No tzatziki or hummus served with the entrees. Just dry meat, dry rice, and some grilled peppers.\\n\\n* Dessert never did come out. By that time, though, we were all just ready to get out of there.\\n\\nHere is my closing to that email:\\nMy husband and I have had good experiences at Phara's, and this one evening will not deter us from returning. However, I do not think any new customers were won over that evening. It was very frustrating, as I thought that all the details had been worked out beforehand. We had raved about Phara's to everyone in anticipation of this evening, and were a little embarrassed at how the evening went, and the quality of the food. At $20 per person, we should have just ordered off the menu. I'd thought that with such a large group, this would take too long, but we ended up waiting so long anyway, it wouldn't have mattered. \\nI really appreciate your time in planning everything, and like I said, my husband and I will definitely be returning to your restaurant. I should also mention that the two gentlemen helping us were very courteous in all of our interactions.\\nThank you, Phara. I hope that, if anything, this can be a learning experience for your staff.\\n\\nThere were several emails back and forth after that, in which she apologized profusely. I was really happy with the way she handled it, as she seemed genuinely concerned and sorry that the night had not gone differently. \\n\\nThis is copied and pasted from her email: \\n\\"I will do all I can to make this up to you, and your family & guests.\\"\\n\\nSounds great, right? Well, that's the last we ever heard from her. She asked us for our address so she could send gift certificates for us and our friends, and promised to refund my mother-in-law \\"at least half\\" of what we paid that night. Then ... NOTHING! I emailed her and left a message with her staff, and never heard from her again.\\n\\nI did not ask for a refund.\\nI did not demand an apology.\\nI did not expect her to send us gift certificates.\\nShe asked how the evening went, and I told her. I even said how disappointed we were because we LOVE Phara's SO much, and her staff was really courteous (though terribly uninformed of what she and I had discussed), and I assured her that we would indeed be returning. \\n\\nWhy, then, did she make all those promises to us? If she had just offered a nice apology after my first email and left it at that, I would have been satisfied and probably would have returned. It's the insincerity of all those promises that really gets me. \\n\\nSince that evening, I've had several friends describe disappointing meals and evenings at this restaurant, so I guess it's decided then. No more Phara's for us, and I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone else."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ok, so you walk up to the counter, order your food and they give you a number.

I ordered an appetizer of Chicken Tikka having no idea what to expect. For $7 I really didn't expect much. However, what I got was more chicken than I could eat. There must have been 6 or 7 large pieces of chicken from which a skewer had been removed. The pieces which were somewhat overcooked were coated in a very spicy dry coating. (Eventually, I would have to surrender to the spiciness and just give up.) The chicken was sitting on a dry melange of salad-y ingredients like lettuce, green pepper, cucumber, raw carrot etc. So I don't get that dish to tell you the truth.

Short, and sweet, Bijou is a quintessential Portland breakfast/lunch/late breakfast spot.  They specialized in organic and seasonal ingredients, and tend to lean towards granola type dishes (i.e. think whole grains, lots of veggies, etc.)  Their specials are always unique and tasty.  Last breakfast was a butternut squash and zucchini omelet.  It was very flavorful and filling.  The wait staff is warm, friendly, and efficient.  There is generally a wait to get in, as you can tell from the reviews, Bijou is popular, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes.  Just walk-in and put your name on their list.  They'll come get you when your table is ready.  If you have a small party, many times you can move past the large groups waiting for a table.  I also think if you don't mind sitting at the bar, you can sit immediately if there is a seat open.  In addition, you can run next door to Stumptown to get a cup of Joe if you need something to hold you over, or just flip through a local rag and know the wait will be worth it.

My husband ordered the pigs in a blanket and I ordered the three egg omelet ($7.00) with each additional items costing more $$.  I added cheese, avocado and bacon so the grand total was over $10.00.  Still, reasonable because it came with potatoes, toast and a fresh fruit cup.\\n\\nBreakfast arrived......my toast was burnt so badly that I asked for another piece, the potatoes were cold and the omelet did not have any avocado.

We got the tab to settle it and it came through as Bombay.  I didn't think much of it, as they are similar quality, therefore probably same price.

Not a very big deal, but just one of those \\"really?\\" moments.  \\nWe got seated and ordered a Pumpkin risotto to split as the appetizer.  It was very good.  Chicken, cranberries, and some other goodness are put inside a carved out pumpkin.  It would be a lot for one person's dinner, but it worked out well as an appetizer to split for ways.\\nThe Boston baked schrod was really good as well.  The steak tips were just OK.  They are on menu as \\"Boston's Best\\".  I didn't see a reference on that, so I'm assuming its just the cooks judgement.  They were very chewy, and seem like they may have been marinating too long. They are not bad, just definitely not Boston's Best.  Also, with the steak tips you apparently only get one side of mashed potato.

The roasted carrots, for being tiny and being carrots, were good but the portion was nearly insulting in terms of cost considerations. The spicy fried chicken was great, sweet and spicy and very flavorful. The crab tamale was interesting, flavorful but perhaps not what we expected. Our favorite was hands-down the snapper, which we wished there was more of (realizing yes we could've ordered another). Don't get me wrong, I wasn't exactly caught off guard to see \\"very small shareable plates\\" - it's not a new phenomenon by any means, but sometimes you have to really stop yourself from saying \\"really?!\\" I wasn't too wowed by the Braccias/duck, perhaps it wasn't complex in terms of balance; it was just okay.

The fixed-price menus work like this:  The set price (usually the same no matter where you go) includes an appetizer, main dish, and a desert.  So, the fixed-price menu will have a few appetizers, main dishes, and deserts to choose from: and you choose one from each section.\\n\\nWith that being said, you should know this review is of the restaurant during this time frame: with the fixed-price menu.\\n\\nWe went for lunch, and were seated immediately.  The place was pretty empty.  We had reservations but clearly did not need them.  Even at the end of our meal, the place still had plenty of empty tables.\\n\\nThe restaurant is Boston's third-oldest restaurant. (Union Oyster House is #1 - is the Parker House #2?)  And this age shows: I've never been in a darker restaurant in Boston.  Dark wood everywhere, ancient artwork, old scrawling designs set into the ceiling panels, and an immense bar with gorgeous wood carvings along it's whole facade.  Very old school Boston.  And very.... smelly?  What IS that smell as you walk in?  And the place could use a freshening-up: the yellowed ceilings have obviously sucked up all that cigar smoke of days gone by.  \\n\\nStill.  It's very Boston.  Dark and regal and old.\\n\\nWaiter hardly spoke to us.  But - he did his job - brought us the food.\\n\\nBread to start - rolls.  They were... nothing special.\\n\\nAppetizer: I got the Ceasar Salad which was pretty good.  The lettuce was slightly wilted.  You know that sort of warm gushy kind of caesar salad you sometimes get?  Pretty close to that - but - I like it.  It did NOT have a giant ancovy laying on top as I had feared from other reviews here.\\nI did not get the Lobster Bisque: but several of my friends did - and they raved about it.\\n\\nFor the main dish I had the Homemade Pasta \\"leaves\\" baked with robiola cheese, grilled asparagus, toasted hazelnuts & celery leaf pesto.  It was... OK.  Reading that description from the menu, I expected a light pasta dish.  It was the opposite: It was a little bowl-dish of something akin to lasagna and grown-up mac + cheese.  It was very oily, heavy and tasted... all right.  I mean who doesn't like pasta and cheese!?  The \\"robiola\\" cheese was very much like ricotta - like a light ricotta.  Not bad.  But it sat like a brick in my stomach when I was done.  The vegetables - what little of it there were - were overcooked.  The pesto was a big spoonful of it laying on top.  Presentation was lacking.\\n\\nMy desert was the \\"Bailys Butterscotch Sundae\\" which was a bowl of 1 scoop of ice cream with cream and caramel sauce drizzed on it with candied nuts of some sort.  I think I inhaled it.  Pretty good.\\n\\nAll-in-all, the food was... OK.  Seriously not a memorable meal and not one that would make me think to bring people here.

But if you're a couple, you'll want to sit at the bar, not the communal tables, but the wait will go quickly with a visit to Henri's & Lick's & the Horseshoe Lounge next door. When we were seated at 7:30, the place was completely packed.  \\n\\nAnd when our first plate arrived, imagine my surprise when the couple next to us broke the illusion of privacy and intimacy with the bar seating by exclaiming to us, \\"Oh, aren't those mussels fantastic? Can you believe the presentation here?\\"  Uh, yeah, it looks pretty cool, and it's not my first time at the rodeo.\\n \\nBut two hours later, as we were impulsively doing all the desserts, a solitary diner was seated next to us at the bar and casually glanced at our dishes. And of course we exclaimed, \\"Can you believe these guys? Who else plates foie gras with hefeweizen doughnuts over peanut ice cream?\\" We found out later she was a chef from Chicago visiting Barley because of its reputation. It probably wasn't her first time at the rodeo either. And that's still the magic of Barley Swine  - it just gets you all excited about food."},{"name":"Baby Acapulco","address":"13609 N I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Ignore the older reviews - this place is under new management and it shows!

I walked by another donut place that smelled like funnel cakes with menu images that looked like they were designed to make children throw tantrums to take them inside or they owned stock in sugar companies. Needless to say, I was uninterested.\\n\\nI looked up Blue Star on a recommendation from a friend and got truly excited about their options. As a self proclaimed foodie, the nuanced options such as bourbon blueberry basil and raspberry rosemary spoke to me! Donuts for grownups also had an appealing sound to it. We patiently waited for sunrise and ventured out of our hotel for the 13 minute trek, excited as a badger heading to a beehive to experience something wonderful. \\n\\nWe were early and first in line, probably due to the added pep in our step. We watched the miracle of donut birth through the windows as we waited for our chance. We used the time to peruse the menu and contemplate the most difficult decision of our lives. Not being local, we knew we would have to get more than a reasonable amount, but not too many as to completely waste them. It sounds trivial, but it was a really hard decision and one we took seriously. We polled the others in line who had the luxury of trying them one or two at a time over a normal period. We also stared at the pictures online, peered through the windows at the growing assortment and meditated, hoping the universe may help guide us. The very friendly hostess inside snuck out to give a lucky few of us early birds a sneak taste of a classic: old fashioned buttermilk. We knew immediately that we were in for a treat no matter what we'd choose. \\n\\nThe doors finally opened and we were ready, list in hand. We ended up choosing 6 more donuts on top of the one we just tried. Why why why? Why not. When will we be back? We bought a variety including an apple fritter, cake donuts, filled donuts and old fashioned. Our favorite was probably the raspberry rosemary, but it's too close to call! Coffee helped cleanse the palate between bites. I wish we had one in Sacramento because I would love to be the hero that brings in boxes of these delights to share with my coworkers!

After reading the reviews, I decided to try it with my family. I took my sister, her husband, and my two nephews for dinner. The fresh bread they serve is delicious, fresh out of the oven, hot, and the garlicky dipping sauce is wonderful as well. We started with some tapas, had the meatball (okay), the bruschetta (delicious with bold garlic flavor), the clams in garlic and wine sauce (YUM!), and the polenta (perfectly crisp with a great garnish of goat cheese and tomatoes). We also ordered the appetizer of calamari for the kids, which they loved. \\nFor dinner, one nephew had the kid's penne alfredo, which he said was \\"the best ever\\" and cleaned up completely, and the other had the cannelloni, which he also loved. I had the seafood stew which was so yummy! Again, lots of garlic which I love, and a bit of a kick with the spice. My sister had the paella, which she said was excellent, as did my brother in law about his pizza. All dishes were a good size, and we took about half the pizza home (my sis and I had pretty much picked out all of the seafood in our dishes, so it was pointless). overall price for 5 people, a lot of food, and 2 glasses of wine: $125, which I think is very reasonable.\\nI would have given them 5 stars, had it not been for the service. Our waiter was okay, but definitely not spectacular. My wine glass was empty for over 10 minutes before he came to see if I'd like another glass, but since my dinner was almost done, I passed. He seemed to disappear for long periods of time even though we were there at 5 when they opened, and there were very few other tables. When I asked about dessert, he handed me the menu and told me there were a couple at the bottom of the specials page and walked away. He came back several minutes later and just said, \\"well?\\", to which I replied, \\"are there any others, or just these two?\\". He begrudgingly went to retrieve the dessert tray.

We arrived to the hotel around 4pm and wanted to check in and have a drink before a nighttime event we had to attend.  My colleague and I went to Champions to get a table when we saw the table cards indicating the $10 food minimum due to the World Cup.... No problem we could use a snack and would probably have 2 drinks a piece.  We approached the hostess and asked for a table but weren't able to be seated because our complete party wasn't there. I understand this policy that some restaurants have, but this was a sports bar, at a hotel - and the other member of our party was just in the lobby checking in. We tried to insist that she would be there in just a few minutes, and even said we would order her drink, but no luck.  There was a line behind us and we weren't getting anywhere. We walked away frustrated an not 30 seconds later our boss arrives. We explain the situation and we all agree we should just walk back up to the hostess and ask to be seated because now we were all ready.  There was a line of course of about 10 patrons in front of us, but we had just walked out of line 1 minute ago. My colleague approached the hostess and asked if we could be seated now, and she of course said no, all these other people were now in front of us! All we wanted was a few drinks and some nachos, but it wasn't going to happen for us.  \\n\\nI understand that the World Cup is a big deal and the restaurant wants to make the most of that business. And that the location of the bar/restaurant attracts customers from Copley place and not just the hotel. But the 3 of us were hotel guests and this is the only place to get a drink in the \\"full service\\" Marriott.   There were tables available and the hostess just didn't want to seat us.   The typical customer at the bar at that time was young and male and also mostly foreign.  We obviously didn't appear to be coming on to watch the game and the hostess made the decision to seat others that might be staying for the whole game.  If this was a privately owned free standing restaurant fine. But as the only place for food and drink at the Marriott they have a duty to cater to the hotel guests first over the general public. \\n\\nAll in all we walked 2 blocks down the street and had great service and experience at Brasserie Jo.

Dessert was quite good, but not worth coming here for.\\n\\nService? Insane. Our waiter gave us our menus and within seconds was hounding us asking us what we wanted to drink. As soon as he brought our drink, he seemed to want our orders. And this was all in a 5 minute span. It's Monday night - the place is empty. What is the hurry? To make it worse, he brought us the bill before we finished dessert.\\n\\nAs for the place in general, I do not recommended it for people looking to have a fine dining experience. This is definitely a place where old people come to die. My friend and I and another couple were the only young ones in the room. Also, if you were a person that had never seen the need for flavorful food, then this might be the place for you. \\n\\nNow I want my evening and my money back..."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I can't say anything bad about this place.

As is often the case when a restaurant is slow, the service was terrible.  Our glasses were constantly empty, and the high school kids waiting tables were not available or attentive.  But the only thing worse than the service was the food.  The calamari had more fried artichokes than calamari, and the sauce it was served with tasted like mayo with a can of salt mixed in.  Then came the entrees... I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off the lunch menu.  The dish came with three TINY meatballs that I'm certain were leftover from the weekend, and the whole dish was sitting in what looked like watered-down spaghetti sauce.

This review is for customer service. I moved to Boulder in 2005 and this was my neighborhood for most of the years I lived here. But I still didn't use this coffee shop, in favor of other places downtown that I preferred. Today I came in for a green tea chai on my way back from an early morning car drop off at the repair shop. I want to preface this with the fact that what happened is just a pet peeve of mine, as I've been in the high end service industry since I was in college. We were first in line with another woman behind us, and had only been there for about fifteen seconds deciding on what to share, when the gentleman behind the counter asked if the woman behind us could go first. At that very moment the order was on its way out of my mouth and if he'd given me one more second, they'd have had my business. I am a firm believer that whomever is first in line, has the right to stand for a short and reasonable period of time deciding what they want, if they don't already know. We were well within that short time period, and I would have liked to have had the chance to place my order before being asked to wait.

My girlfriend and I came in on Sunday afternoon for lunch, we were the fifth table to sit down in the restaurant around 12:45/12:50. We ordered drinks and an appetizer which came out quickly. For our main we ordered a classic and oaxaca burgers with a side each, around 1:05/1:10. At 1:40 we still had not received our food and no fewer than six tables who arrived and ordered after us had already received our food. Our server was actually the bright spot of the visit and informed us that it looked like our food was in its way out. That was ten minutes before we actually got our food. When our burgers arrived we were told the manager had been notified that it took us a long time to get our food. I would estimate that it took us 20 minutes to get through our meal and in that time the restaurant was full. At no time did the manager leave her post expediting food to offer an apology. When we asked for our check we also asked to speak with the manager Kelsey. After waiting for well over five minutes and our server telling us on multiple occasions that she was on her way and they were just too busy, we left. Flip is billed as a burger boutique and with their prices we expect solid service and the acknowledged of a delay and an apology from someone who is in a position to make things right. We never asked to have an item comped, I ate the food, I want to pay for it. But that is all we got. Three $3 items comped when all we wanted was the manager to walk out from the expo station for two minutes, hold up food and say 'guys I'm really sorry for the delay we just got slammed and it over whelmed us this afternoon. I'm sorry.'

I was very disapointed with the Catfish.  To me it more or less seemed like it came out of a frozen food bag and was heated up, either that or from a long john silver but not from somewhere where you pay good money for people who went to culinary school to learn how to cook your meals.\\n\\nThe greens that came with the catfish were very tasty. However, the catfish had no seasoning on it.  Maybe I was expecting more of a blackened catfish, or maybe some lemon wedges to give it some flavor, or something besides being plain.  \\n\\nThe whiskey selection is more than impressive.  We ordered the Oregon Bourbon flight as well as teh Bourbon flight.  Both were wonderful.  The grits that accompanied the shrimp were creamy and delicious too.

We had to decide in advance on the menu, and we went with the following: pita and dips (red pepper, tsatziki, hummus) -- they kept refilling the bread, which was key; gulf white shrimp saganaki (which we hoped would be served on fire, but was not - stupid fire codes) -- these were also the hugest prawns I'd ever seen; baby calamari; spanakopita (so outstanding we asked for more); giant white castorian bean stew; scallop santorini; traditional country salad (tomato & feta); and 3 desserts -- baklava, creamy rice pudding, and loukoumades (essentially fried dough with honey).  Everything was insanely delicious and got raves from the whole table. Seriously, not a weak spot in the lineup. We loved the spanakopita so much we begged for more, and they brought us another round without charging us.  I wish I hadn't been too full for the rice pudding!  We all stuffed ourselves silly and waddled back to our hotel.\\n\\nCouple other notes:  one of the 21 in our party was a vegetarian, and the chef made him a special order of quinoa and kale, which was a nice touch.  And because we were all traveling on business and our lives would be easier if we could show receipts for reimbursement, our server kindly did 21 individual checks - very cool.   \\n\\nGreek isn't my favorite cuisine, but if I'm in the neighborhood again, this just might require a re-visit to test out the rest of the menu.

That said, I can vouch for their creamy tikka masala and juicy tandoori chicken.  However, I only just got a chance to eat at the actual Cumin restaurant.

It also caters to big events and groups,  at least if my visit is anything to go by.  However, I had no trouble getting seated either, despite being alone.\\n\\nAs to food, most of the menu is your typical Indian restaurant fair.  However, there was also something I had never seen before - aloo dum kashmiri ....which is to say a mixture of raisins and nuts stuffed into roasted potato and covered with a rich almond-based sauce.  Yeah, it's as good as it sounds.  The texture is fantastic - a nice mix of chewy and crunchy, with a bit of crisp from a mild crusting on the potato shell.  And the sauce is one of the best of its kind - super rich and creamy.  It's served with rice, per the norm, and left me too full for dessert.  Of course, I also had some naan to scoop up the sauce.  It is pretty good and has a nice flavor, but I'm not sure it's the best I've had. It's served as a single round that has been sliced in half.  The edges are doughy and thick, but the inner part of the circle is thin and super crispy.  A little too crispy for my tastes, to be honest... still, not bad.  \\n\\nI had planned to try one of the desserts - there is a nice selection to choose from - but I honestly couldn't eat anything else after finishing the main course.  Instead, I got a cup of chai which was pretty good.  Refills are free, by the way.\\n\\n\\nService was polite, friendly, and efficient.  Throughout the course of the meal, I had multiple people come by to make sure things were okay and give refills.\\n\\nPrices, meanwhile, are about average for Indian food in Columbus, with most entrees costing between $10.99~13.99.   Vegetarian dishes are the least expensive, of course, and the list available is pretty extensive. They also advertise on the website that they are willing to work with you on dietary constraints.\\nOne other little thing I noticed - I don't think Cumin has a \\"kid's\\" menu, but they did bring out a page of a coloring book for one kid at a table near me.  I would have thought that was pretty cool when I was a kid.  \\n\\n\\nAnyways, if you're at Polaris and looking for Indian, it's definitely worth a try.

I prefer it the classic way, where the fish is chopped up and marinated in spicy mayo. But here it was a piece of tuna with cucumber and barley any spicy mayo. I couldn't even tell it was spicy. Luckily I asked for an extra side of spicy mayo and boi was it good. I had a try at the firecracker roll and it was amazing! If I could recommend one roll, it would be the firecracker roll. The presentation was above average and was nice looking. Pricing was a bit high with the Georgia roll coming in at $18 with 9 pieces and the Spicy Tuna roll at $8 with 8 pieces.

We had the mac and cheese, Brunswick stew, fried okra and fried green tomatoes.  It was our first time here, so we went for the full throttle. \\n\\nIn order, the ribs were tasty and the sauce that they waitress bought to the table in the red ketchup bottle, did them even more justice.  The pulled pork was alright, nothing to elaborate on further, the smoked bird was juicy, and needed nothing added to it. The pulled bird was cold, and while it was delicious, it was cold, so that took away from it. The mac and cheese.  I've had better.  Right in my own kitchen as a matter of fact, the fried green tomatoes:see my above reference on the okra.  My mother and I were fighting over the last one.  The Brunswick stew, either it was just okay, or it was missing something as I don't recall eating it, and the sliver that I had in my to-go box the next morning didn't impress me either. \\n\\nI will admit to being disappointed in the size of side items at $4 each.  Namely the okra (lol) and the mac and cheese.  I thought it would have been much more of each at $4 a small bowl size.\\n\\nNow onto our server.

The service was TERRIBLE. The food was decent but not phenominal. The space....sucked, I don't know how else to put it. It was so crowded. I have been in small restaurants that make the space work, this one doesn't.\\n\\nWe were in the area on a Sunday evening, it was early but we were hungry so we looked for place that was already serving dinner. We show up at the restaurant at 5PM right as the restaurant in opening. There are two occupied tables in the restaurant  but stil we are directed to a tiny table next to the bathroom next to their computer. The table had some random objects on the table that looked like an employee had been using the table to get some work done. We turned back to the waitress to ask about the items and she was already gone. We awkwardly put the items next to the computer and sat down. \\n\\nWe were brought over 2 menus, one was a list of the specials, the second was the regular menu that had some things highlighted in green. I asked what the green meant and she said that they were out of those items. The green items made up about 30% of the menu. Really? You're literaly opening the menu with half the items on the menu not avaialable?? Crazy.\\n\\nForging on. The waitress explained that we should mark with the provided marker what we wanted and what size, she suggested a small for 2 people. She also said that everything comes out as one course. I would have appreciated a little more explaination, such as, a small order of halibut entails one very small filet in a bowl, by it's self. Hardly enough for two to share. We made our choices feeling like we were stabbing in the dark unsure if we were ordering enough food. \\n\\nOur food came and we could barely put all of the dishes on our tiny tiny table. The wait staff was very aloof and made us feel like we shouldn't have ordered so many dishes because they wouldn't all fit on the table. Why don't they just behave like a normal restaurant and give it to us in courses then if their tables won't fit the absurd number of dishes? \\n\\nAs mentioned, the food was good, if not a little salty. We had to order a second round of food because we both felt a little hungry still after round 1. I just felt like if I was spending that much money on dinner, it should be phenominal experience all around rather than feeling like a bother that's been delegated to the corner."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant was a little disappointing...

Things have not changed too much over the years, which could be viewed as a good thing or bad thing. Sweet Tomatoes is known for being a \\"Salad Buffet\\" Restaurant. When you first walk in the restaurant, the salad bar is the first thing you see. You grab a tray, pick from copious amounts of different salads, and then you pay the cashier. There was a new item I tried this time. It was a spicy penne pasta salad which had corn, black beans, green onions etc.They also added Cotija cheese (which I love), so I sprinkled some on top. It was quite tasty, and one of my favorite items of the day. I also got some of their Caesar salad- which never disappoints and some \\"Picnic Style\\" potato salad. Their salad bar is always a highlight when going there- as it should be, since they are a Salad Buffet Restaurant. I had my mom with me in a wheelchair, and before we even paid, they had a helper waiting right there to carry her tray for her! This was super considerate and impressive. More places should be so thoughtful to handicap needs. Kudos to Sweet Tomatoes for doing that without asking.\\n   After you pay, you pick your table. I immediately went to get my drink after putting my tray down. I LOVE their Strawberry Lemonade there.. probably in my top 3 for Strawberry Lemonades in town. (Burger Fi just might be my #1!) Sweet Tomatoes version is delicious though, and they even sell it by the gallon to take home. Well they used to anyway, don't quote me on that. Now, there are 4 other stations you can visit to get food here. The first is a fruit bar, which honestly, I don't think I have ever gone to. It's very small and has a meager selection of fruit and some cottage cheese. The other 3 stations are hot/baked items. They have a soup section. It has a nice variety to pick from. This time they had French Onion, which is my absolute favorite, so I had to try. MEH. Not the best.. not even close. The broth was thin with not a lot of flavor. Not a deal breaker though, as a good French Onion Soup can be tricky to find out. My sister got the Tomato Soup. She said she gets it every time, and its always yummy! The next station has a bread/baked good selection. They have these little Focaccia Cheese Bread slices, which my sis said was perfect to dip in her Tomato Soup. The absolute best part about Sweet Tomatoes, also located in the bread sector, is the MUFFINS. Anyone you ever hear talking about ST's is almost always raving about the Blueberry Muffins! They are definitely delectable and a MUST when going there. This time they had Gluten Free Coconut muffins that were phenomenal! So light and airy. I also tried the Cranberry Orange muffins which were my favorite. Double chocolate chip were also being served, but everyone in my party agreed that they weren't that good. The final station is another Hot Station serving up pasta. There was a spaghetti, mac & cheese, and a fettuccine. The fettuccine had a pink colored sauce with spaghetti noodles? It looked like they just put a fresh pan out so I tried it. It was okay, but again, not a lot of flavor.\\n   It costs about $11 + your drink cost to eat at Sweet Tomatoes. It's always seemed a little pricey to me. I know it's a buffet with it's endless eats, but they don't serve any proteins or anything I would call a \\"staple\\" dish. It's nice place to take your mom for lunch (like I did today), or to go every now and again. Definitely NOT a dinner or date night kinda restaurant. It's a unique concept, I'll give them points for that. The staff always seems very friendly which is always a plus. \\n   Furthermore, Sweet Tomatoes if absolutely worth trying at least once to get the experience.

Sometimes these can really ruin your experience or make you overlook the simple joy in food that is prepared well.\\n\\nBefore coming to Chef Hung, I had heard that this restaurant chain was the recipient of multiple Best of Taiwan awards.  Having heard so much about how good the beef noodle soup was in Taiwan, I found my expectations through the roof.\\n\\nFirst things first: this chain is located in the huge and new Aberdeen Center mall.  The interior decor is clean and nice and the service, while quiet, is pretty good.  \\n\\nYou order off a simple menu of noodle soups, snacks, and a few beverages.\\n\\nWe stuck with the following choices:\\n\\nChampion Beef Shank, Beef Tendon, Beef Tripe with Noodles and Spicy Beef soup - at $11.95, it's definitely a very pricey bowl of noodles.  Granted, most of the price is based on the reputation but I can see why many have faulted for the high price.  Two pieces of beef shank, two pieces of tendon and two pieces of tripe came with my order.  It wasn't particularly generous but ok.  I would have preferred more tendon and shank though.  The broth was clear and quite a bit more subdued than I expected.  As a spicy beef broth, I found it neither particularly beefy nor spicy.  The noodles were excellent.  Thick and roughly cut, I thought they went perfectly with what you would want in beef noodle soup.  Overall, it was a solid bowl.  Not spectacular, but still good.  If my expectations had been unknown or lower, I would have been impressed.  Especially at a better price point.\\n\\nMarinated Pig Intestines - we ordered this on a whim and were surprised by the bold flavor and how fresh the intestines tasted.  I've tried some less than ideal preparations and this was nowhere like that.  Frankly, I think this was the best dish here and the strong flavor was how I hoped the beef broth would be. \\n\\nTaiwanese Vegetables and Oyster Sauce - nicely cut and fresh taiwanese vegetables.  Asked for more oyster sauce and got some immediately.  I really think the produce must be better here in Richmond.  :)\\n\\nChef Hung was a good restaurant.  Although I agree that the noodle soup prices are a bit insane, it is a good bowl of fresh cut noodles, although perhaps not quite as stellar as my expectations.  The pig intestines were fantastic though and I suspect there are quite a few solid items on this menu.  The location in Aberdeen is very nice and the decor is one that seems to be popular with working folk.\\n\\nChef Hung accepts credit cards."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"5043 Tuttle Crossing Blvd, Ste 205","city":"Dublin","stars":"3","text":"Horrible service.

They have this system where if you need your server you just out a card in the holder and they come over.  Pretty cool actually.  On top of that our server still made the usual pit stops to make sure we were ok.\\n\\nFood: 4 - I really enjoyed the food.  Since it was our first time we tried a little of every thing is seemed like. Starters: Grilled corn (excellent), mushroom mole tamale (just ok), fresh pineapple with lime (good), and chips and salsa (good).

Even if the only other person there is around the corner and behind a wall, she still be able to hear every word you are saying no matter how quietly you speak.  If you are that person, you might consider earplugs/headphones if you are easily distracted and want to study.\\n\\nAs for drinks, I went with a standard cappuccino which was crafted into existence by a barista who knew what he was doing, even if he wasn't enthused.

If you have a larger group, then usually the roll at the end would all be different. What you get in omakase really depends on the season. The most recent time I went there was uni (sea urchin), ikura (salmon roe), chopped scallop, uni on engawa (sea urchin on halibut), negitoro with quail egg yolk, saba, aji (horse mackerel), and salmon belly. Most of the time Yuji would end the omakase with a roll with hamachi, salmon and tuna in it. Nigiri comes out one at a time, and the servers will let you know what each piece is. When they give you a bill, they will also give you a small pack of pockey (chocolate covered biscuit) as a small dessert. It is very likely that you will not get a spot if you don't make reservations. Also, since there is only one sushi chef, please be prepared to wait a little longer for the food.

In terms of ambiance, this restaurant could be as dressy/classy or as laid-back and casual as you want it to be. Warm, low lighting and a groovy, eclectic music selection. For appetizers we shared the Braised Pork Belly Buns and the Green dumplings (edamame, mustard greens, and wasabi). I had never had pork belly before; and I have been  day-dreaming ever since, about the mouth-watering flavor of the meat, lightly sweet and wrapped in this lightweight bun that resembled a pillow. Beautiful AND delicious. The 5 dumplings were large and plump, 2-3 bites each and with a subtle heat from the wasabi. For my entree I considered ordering the Chicken and Waffles (! ! !), but ultimately chose Fish Tacos because the accompanying whipped cilantro piqued my interest. Two tacos, generously sized pieces of crispy hake and crunchy kimchee, corn-flour tortillas that tasted freshly made. Mild heat, and very flavorful. Informative and laid-back service from our server, who (thankfully) did not pressure into buying alcoholic drinks. The maitre d' (perhaps the manager?) checked in on us towards the end of our meal- a nice touch. Between the two appetizers and the tacos, I concluded dinner with very satisfied taste buds, and the lovely realization that I wasn't overstuffed, but completely satiated thanks to the reasonably sized portions. I wanted more food because the presentation and flavor was incredible, and anxiously await my next visit."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Admittedly, I'd give any decent Pho place 4 stars I think, there's really nothing between bad pho and good pho.

It is in a shopping plaza next to a Rite Aid & Steinmart, off Peachtree Road.  It's funny because I do late night runs to Rite Aid all the time and have never noticed this restaurant and I was just shopping at Steinmart the other day and didn't even give this place a first glance.  I took a day off to handle some much needed business and when I yelped restaurants near my home this restaurant came highly recommended.  I was pleasantly surprised to walk in to this dimly lit oasis.  I opted to sit on the patio and got my own little section to myself.  The patio is like walking into a botanical garden.  It has greenery and flowers everywhere.  There are 3 nooks to the patio.  One larger space and two smaller more intimate spaces.  It has a beautiful fountain and fireplace for those nights where it's not too hot but not too cold.  I was told that at night there are blue lights and candles that illuminate the space making it a very romantic scene.  Here's a tip...call in a reservation to ensure you get the intimate seating outside.  I'm definitely coming back for that experience.  \\n\\nAs for my drink and food.  I was extremely pleased.  My server, Will, was sooooooo friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I tried all of his recommendations and give them two thumbs UP.  The Rose' was light and crisp and much needed in the early afternoon.  Not enough to get tipsy but just right to start off the meal.  As an appetizer, I ordered the Brussel Sprouts with the Paprika Aioli Sauce and when I tell you these two coupled together is like a tantalizing party on the taste buds.  As my meal, I ordered the Mandarin Glazed Salmon with Sugar Snap Peas but instead of the Wild Rice I decided upon the Truffle Fries.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The Salmon was moist and tender and the snap peas were delicious.  My only complaint would be to add more Truffle to the fries.  It would kick the flavor up that much more.  \\n\\nFinally, the bathroom...It is the cleanest bathroom I've EVER been in.  Like cleaner than the doctor's office.lol  It was not just clean but it was new.  For for this restaurant to be 13 years old everything form the flooring to the seating looks relatively new.  \\n\\nOverall, this dining experience was top notch and I'm so glad to have happened upon this neighborhood restaurant!"},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Never a disappointment.

I think they expanded the first floor b/c I don't remember there being a bar towards the left side past the dance floor.

I checked out their website to discover that their burgers are unlike most that you find anywhere else. Not the plain, old school hamburgers or cheeseburgers that have different cheeses or you might add bacon to. The creative director of Flip, Richard Blais, has appeared on \\"Top Chef: Chicago\\" and \\"Iron Chef America\\". The menu is actually not terribly priced for what you get. Your standard burger is $6.50 and most the rest go up to $9, with the exception of the \\"A5\\", a 5.5 oz. Japanese Kobe (A5 rating) patty, foie gras (look it up if you don't know what it is), truffle butter, b&b pickles and red wine syrup, which will set you back $30! They also serve \\"flip\\" burgers which give you choices besides beef, such as pork, shrimp, wild mushroom and others. One other thing they serve are their shakes... liquid N milkshakes. They have Nutella & burnt marshmallow, pistachio & white truffle, foie gras (again, look it up if you haven't yet) and I had to try the Krispy Kreme flavor. It is exactly like you would imagine a liquid donut would taste, delicious.\\n\\nI chose to go with the Philly burger, topped with french onions, green peppers, ketchup and Cheese Whiz! After it came out, it was a little smaller than I had expected, but that's my fault for not reading the menu which states the beef burgers are 5.5 oz: hangar steak, brisket and short rib. I was also confused on the cheese whiz. It wasn't the fake, processed, bold yellow/orange-goo that I'm used to seeing, it was white and almost had a whipped butter-like consistency. It even melted like butter would once I started digging in. Despite the size it was excellent, and actually, looking back on it, 8 oz burgers might be that \\"just too big\\" size where you just have those last few bites left and go ahead and finish it only to regret it 10 minutes later. I did leave there with a full stomach, but not overly full. So if you're in the area, definitely check out Flip.\\n\\nI will forewarn that parking might be tough, so get there early (they open at 5 for dinner) and don't expect privacy. There are only 3 booths, and two rows of tables in the center that seat four, which, if you have two in your party, could mean you'll end up sitting with two strangers.

Literally we waited an hour just to get within the doors of the restaurant, to still wait in a line that cuts through the restaurant while people are eating.  Can we say tease.  And top of that tease-as a prize for waiting in line, they served garlic fries to guest so they can encourage guest to check out the new flavors with their fries and possible order it.\\n\\nOverall-love the simplicity of the menu.  I like how there was a wide range of burgers to choose from like a chili cheese fritos burger, a lamb burger and to the classic bacon burger.  Do i think it was really worth the hour wait for these burgers-not really.  Don't get me wrong, the chili cheese fritos burger was a good burger, but it didnt knock my socks off.  The garlic fries in my opinion lacked garlic.

The portions are like the perfect size, you won't get overly full but you are left satisfied.

We arrived ten minutes after opening and there was a group of older japanese gentlemen, running, yes, running into the restaurant to get a table. \\nThere's nothing fancy about the decor of the restaurant, with it's movable wood partitions, it sort of reminded me of a Korean restaurant.

They serve their ikura prepared as ikura no shoyu-zuke, which I enjoy, but I know that it may also mean that the roe has been sitting around a little bit. The uni was fresh, but not the best quality. It was a darker, less sweet, less creamy grade. The saba was nice, tender and oily. \\nMy grandma ordered tempura, I tried a bit. It was pretty good, not as light as I prefer, but the veggies tasted fresh and I could taste that the oil was clean. The tempura sauce wasn't traditional, it was a bit more on the sweet side- probably to appeal to an American palate.  My 17 mo old loved it. \\nTheir hamachi-Kama was really nicely done, I love it when the skin portions are all crispy and the flesh isn't overdone. Being that we were the first seating for the night and we already got the last hamachi kama, it's very limited, but that's pretty typical for any restaurant. \\nThere was some confusion about what types of fish were available after we placed our orders and some things were just...missing. It was a sore point for my mother who wanted hotate and instead of the server informing us that they didn't have any, it just didn't show up when our food arrived.

The texture and noodles were good overall. \\n\\nIt took about 30 min for the buns to come out and another 15-20 for the Banh mi/ fried rice even though we had ordered the Banh mi when we arrived and the fried rice much later. Our last dish was given to us quickly but it was the cold dan dan noodles. Luckily they gave us the right dish soon after.\\n\\nOverall we spent way too much time waiting for our food.. Especially because the place cleared out around 3:15 so the wait should have been shorter. This is definitely the longest I've had to wait for my meal. Service was friendly/ good. With drinks our meal came to around 60. It's definitely a cool place with nice ambiance and a hipster vibe. \\nBut I would much rather spend 60 at an authentic asian restaurant and be full/ have leftovers."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Came here with a group of 12 on a Wednesday morning and the service was great.

The fresh blueberries were made into a nice compote that went well with the brioche. However, I tried the smoked salmon eggs benedict as well but I wasn't a huge fan.

She enticed me to check it out by giving me a coupon for $25 of food and drink for $10,   so of course I was there the very next day to check out the cheap eats.\\n\\nI arrived at the bar totally blind.  There were no reviews or websites for the bar online so I had no idea what kind of food they served.   Tucked away, the feel is that of a local's bar but with a more up-scale feel.   Couches, books, and board games line the walls giving the atmosphere an inviting and cozy quality.  On Sundays, the back of the bar is transformed into a cozy movie theatre with rows of love-seats to lounge upon and catch a free flick on the huge projection screen.  On cold nights there is a fire pit to sit around on the patio and sip a glass of wine either with friends or a romantic date.\\n\\nThe happy hour menu ranges from $1 to $6 featuring snacks, bruscetta and pizzas.    Not a ton to choose from but I love pizza so I remained undiscouraged.   For $6  you can choose from either caramelized onion and blue cheese, pepperoni and olive, or roast garlic and roast peppers.  The bar offers a house-made, high-gluten dough which takes a total of 3 days to prepare.  I went with the garlic and pepper pizza and my mouth literally watered as it was cooked at the front of the house, delicious cooking smells wafting throughout the bar.   The pizza was a personal size, but generous enough to easily split.  The crust was thin and the overall taste and texture was greasy, but delightfully savory.  This delicious flavor is leant from the blend of provolone, mozzarella, asiago, and piccante cheeses.  Truly a cheese connoisseur's delight.  The pizza was topped with soft roasted cloves of garlic and thin ribbons of red peppers.  Before I knew it, I had eaten the entire thing.  The dish had a very similar flavor and texture profile  to A Pizza Scholls, but without the hour wait and the \\"large size only\\" restriction.\\n\\n The bar also features an array of classic, 1950's-ish cocktails (a la Mad Men) as well as local wines and beers.  The full menu offers some tapas and classic cocktail appetizers to go along with the theme of the drinks.  Options include cheese and cured meats plates, stuffed eggs, pate, and marinated mushrooms.   The service is very personal and attentive.  It's a very \\"where everyone knows your name\\" feel.  Come for the decadent pizza, stay for the coziness."},{"name":"Song La","address":"411 W 23rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I would say it's pretty legit.

The young lady who also was on the clock made the order however the sugar in my iced was not melted, so asked if it can be melted and told JAMES Who then proceeded to fix it I simply asked him if he could not add too much of the hot coffee in the cup to melt the sugar because I looked at the cup and the amount of coffee in it was half of full, (which would defeat the purpose of my getting the actual iced coffee.)He had an issue with what I asked and tells me it's not regular sugar being used to make my coffee, but that it was donut sugar  I'm like what?

I know for a fact that sugar can be melted however I ended up asking for no sugar because of me having to get to work but I asked for caramel to be added to the coffee.

I am vegan and therefore of course Disney offers very few choices. This restaurant ranked pretty high so I was stoked to eat her after choosing to go to the Animal Kingdom Park.  So, after waiting over 30 minutes to be seated,  I inquired the server about vegan options.

So, I  thought PERFECT!\\n\\nWell, the dish comes, and it is soooooo salty that I had to ask the server to return the dish.  The manager comes, shorter, older blonde hair woman comes by, and asks me about it.  I state that when the chef came by, I had no idea that soy sauce was going to be doused in this dish.  I thought that I was going to add it myself since the chef pointed to the soy sauce containers on the table. The chef gave me a snarky response as \\"didn't you know that such and such dish uses soy sauce?\\"......which to me, was \\"if I knew, we wouldn't be having his conversation.\\"\\n\\nSo, we had the dish remade again.  \\n\\nOnce this one arrived it looked oddly shiny.  I took one forkful and spit it out.  My mouth had a greasy film on it.  My friend said my dish looked like glass.  \\n\\nThe server came by and asked me about it.  I said this dish was just as bad that the chef, out of spite, completely oiled up my dish.  So, for me, trying to be healthy, it was abmismal.  He apologized and asked me if I wanted to see the manager again, and I said no, just give me the bill.  He did ask if I wanted to see the manager to take it off the check, but I just wanted to get out of the there.

There's a good amount of seating, and it's wicked easy to get a drink. The top floor is amazing. It's separated into 2 rooms. The room to the right side has a good size bar with some stools, and cushioned couches lining the walls. Yes, sometimes you'll see some not-so-classy folk humping each other on those couches, but it's all in good fun =P\\n\\nThe room to the left is the main reason I love this place. It's a giant hardwood dance floor, and there's usually a sick live DJ who plays everything you wanna hear--from old school hip-hop/dance (including salt n peppa! I mean come on! Yes!) to top-40 to deadmau5.

If you smoke you have to do it outside, but there is plenty of seating out on the patio so it's not a problem. \\n\\nThe reason I really like The Local is the food.

I particularly liked that the mushrooms were cut into little pieces.  Thought this gave it a nice texture and made each bite more palatable.  I also like that they use different types of bread for each sandwich (brioche, focaccia, white bread, etc) and that they lightly toast all their bread, but not to the point where it hurts your hard palate.  \\n\\nThe crab sandwich from the chef of L'Espalier (one of my favorite restaurants) was a disappointment.  It was like a glorified tuna salad sandwich.  Except it was crab.  I was expecting chunks.  Of crab.  Or even a crabcake.  Not into it!

After being a regular there, you get to know the waiters, they come by, and sometimes sit down at the table and hang out! They yell across the restaurant at each other, they wear sweatpants and have gold chains hanging out of their Red Sox shirts.  Very informal, but very easy going, relaxing atmosphere, like being at home.  \\nSo why is this place the best?  I just described the atmosphere.  They have a jukebox that is loaded with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  The have the most unbelievable Italian barbecue:  a plate of fresh sausage, lamb tips, sweet hot peppers and fresh baked bread.  That is for starters.  Then, the pizza.  I have never tasted pizza this good.  Not in Boston, not in New Haven, not in New york.  The crust, the sauce, the cheese, it is great.  And all you need to order is the cheese pizza and maybe the garlic pizza.  To top it all off, the wine is cheap too.  A carafe of house wine is around $10 and bottles of chianti are about $12-$13!!.  So two people can have barbecue, a pizza, and a bottle of wine for about $35!!!.  I do miss this place...."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"After Katrina, an Italian colleague from New Orleans stayed in Austin for several months.  Before she went back to New Orleans she took several of us who had helped her out here to Andiamo for dinner.  She called around to several Italian restauants and chose Andiamo when the person answered the phone in Italian (or at least with an Italian accent).  The food was great, but she ordered for us and there were wonderful things I didn't know the names for.  She was treated as family by the people there and we, her guests, were treated like royalty.

We have dined here once before with another group of people.  \\n\\nLast night it was four of us and ordered a variety of dishes including lamb, fish and chicken.  Each meat (tib) gets one side so we ordered miser, tomato fit fit and ater.  Miser is one of my favorite lentil dishes because it is lentils cooked in red spicy sauce.  Our server recommended we get lamb with a spicy sauce (awez style) and we're glad she did.  We ordered one fish platter awez style and one plain; we were grateful to had two types of fish on our platters.  The fish with the sauce was one of our favorites along with the lamb with awez.  The fish without the sauce is also perfectly pan fried tilapia crisp on the outside while also being tender and moist on the inside.  The chicken was fine.  Ater was also fine; we are used to Indian food therefore thought miser and ater tasted a lot like some Indian lentil dishes.  Our least favorite item was tomato fit fit because it was served cold; it's a tomato and chopped up injera made into a salad.  (Not a fan of cold dishes that aren't salads or dips.)  \\n\\nOur server was very competent and helpful.   Glad to enjoy good Ethiopian food in Atlanta.  1 star docked for the prices; the restaurant's prices are slightly above normal, especially for a cuisine that shouldn't charge so much.

Outdoor wasn't as packed because the weather kept alternating between rain and shine. \\n\\nSo with it being so long since I've been, i really wanted to get the meat lovers choice where you can choose three different meat tibs, but my friend wasn't as hungry, so therefore i just opted for the fish tibs.

I had gone to another popular local tapas restaurant, waited forever to sit down, even arriving at 5:00, and was elbowed and hip-checked all night by foodie hipsters who stand around drinking and yelling next to patrons who are trying to eat. It was nice to be able to make a reservation... I had to call, but they called me back and I got in at the time I requested,  Friday night at 6:00 (blue plate special time, but we were planning to hang out and eat/drink slowly and copiously). \\n\\nWe were greeting by three very friendly and efficient hostesses, and decided to sit at the bar, rather than taking our table. The room is large and airy, with multiple areas to sit, including at the large curved bar, tables in another room that seemed quieter, the main room, and an outdoor patio. The place was relatively empty until around 7:30-8:00. \\n\\nAt the recommendation of our charming bartender, we drank a spanish rosado called Muga, which was quite flavorful and served at the perfect temp, with a healthy pour. \\n\\nFor dinner we ate the great bread, dipped in olive oil, followed by avocado crostini, beet and watermelon salad, pork belly, grilled swordfish, hangar steak, swiss chard, and tuna belly confit. All of the dishes were very good, and prepared without too much salt which is rare at tapas bars. Spanish food tends to be salty, and restaurants tend to over-salt. Not really Spanish food, though---more like an Americanized, healthier version, but I can say that I love small plates much more than huge entrees...For dessert we had the chocolate indulgence cake and the warm berry tart, and a glass of amontillado sherry. Yay!!\\n\\nWhile we were there, a very nice manager came over and told us about the bloody mary bar. They have a green tomatillo bloody mary! I've been waiting for that for years.....not a huge fan of the typical spicy tomato-juice BM. \\n\\nWe got out of there for $150 for two, and we had everything we wanted. Considering how much we drank, it probably makes sense, though it does seem like a lot....\\n\\nIt got crazy in there, and eventually people were yelling orders to the bartender through our conversation--like, poking their heads IN BETWEEN me and my friend to order. At one point there were two large groups of people hollering right behind us, to the point where we couldn't hear each other talk.

I have a mild allergy to coconut - mild enough that I was okay eating here, but not okay enough that I would be fine ordering everything off the menu - and he said that what we ordered was fine. I know how coconut tends to sneak its way into things (and how servers don't tend to know the dishes as intimately as the chefs do), so I wish he would have told me that he would check to make sure that these were okay (he came back about ten minutes later to say that we'd have to replace the chicken satay, which I wondered about - I wish he would have checked with the kitchen first so that we wouldn't have had to wait so long for our first plates). Maybe I'm just used to a little more hand holding, and maybe he was having a bad day, but throughout the night I found him a bit pushy and rushed. \\n\\nNevertheless, the gin/lemon drink that I ordered was amazing. I'm not typically a gin drinker, but it was so perfectly balanced. My hubby ordered a beer from Oregon that he thoroughly enjoyed.

The texture and flavour was amazing. For mains, we ordered the pad thai and the pork belly -  I didn't find the pad thai to be as complex as I would have liked, and the pork belly was a bit tough, but overall they were very good. \\n\\n\\nSo yeah - in sum, it's a nice restaurant with great ambiance and wonderful flavours.

For real.  The sauce had milk products in it, so the chef had to sub with plain soy sauce, which tasted pretty bad. There were hardly any veggies in the vegetable lo mein, so I had to personally ask the chef to add other healthier veggies like peppers and broccoli that were clearly on the menu in other dishes, but not in the one veggie dish. To be fair, they were great at handling our party of 10, and all the meat lovers at the table thought their food was pretty good, though their opinions are not based on extensive Asian food experience.

The broth was delicious and I really wanted to consume all of that first. Noodles were great and had a nice level of firmness overall.

Everything together tasted great and I really wanted to have some more. \\n\\nIt was definitely a fun night to have stopped by Danbo. Nitpick about the dish itself, the only other possible complaint is just that it's so popular and everyone wants to stop by for a bite. It might be hard to get inside and dine.

Now, it's not an extensive collection of food by any means, but it's worth the price for sure. There was some egg curry dish I didn't care for at all, but the lamb korma was good - creamy, rich and flavorful, and the chicken dish was good too. I didn't care for the vegetarian options and normally I eat more of those. Naan is brought to you nice and hot as you eat and not left at the buffet bar to become dry and crisp. Overall a great value if you're going for lunch. As far as dinner goes, if you order the right thing it's good. The appetizers we got were great. We had chicken pakora which was a good sized appetizer and chicken tandoori bites which was small but had good flavor. The chicken korma was my favorite during dinner. We also had Kashmiri kofta korma and shahi paneer. I liked the gravy of the chicken korma. The vegetarian options had too much ginger in the gravy for my taste. I would give it a try during lunch to get a feel for the food. Dinner ended up costing us $70. I would go back if I wanted a cheap Indian lunch buffet, but my hunt continues for good Indian dinner."},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Would it be inappropriate to lick the plate?!!

I loved everything on the plate other than the yellow lentil thing that was kind of bland.

If you are the impatient type, or expect to be treated like royalty.  Don't bother.  This is truely the place to appreciate the whole experience.   \\n\\nSo your experience will begin with a 20 minute to 1 hour wait in line outside - yes that includes B-towns bitter winter.  When you get inside you will notice it's not really special, it's not and that's the beauty of it.  \\nWood Panel walls and really old tables with benches.  Yes the bathrooms are a little dingy but clean.  This is the point where you need to remind yourself this is all for the experience.\\n\\nMenu is simple - just order a cheese pie (no lame toppings  please), lamb & sauage grill and there is nothing more to look for.  Don't ask for the menu as it just makes you stand out.  Drinks are perfect.  Reasonably prices Son's of Italy get more than what you are paying for rock you ass off mixed drinks, beer and limited wines.\\n\\nThe staff has a reputation of being hard-asses and honestly I just think this is coming from some sensitive peoples.  They are really nice and it goes back to the basic school.  Treat others as you want to be treated.  I've been going there for-ever and the staff recongizes me.

The first time I went there I inquired about vegan options and instead of telling me about what they have, the manager simply insists that their meat is sustainable. Um... F. U!  My beliefs on sustainability aside, there are many reasons people people want other options.  Don't visit my intentions. Not ever.  I thanked him and left with my stomach still empty.\\n\\nCut to visit number two.  I was running late for a job orientation and was severely undercaffeinated so out of desperation I decided to run in there and grab a quick latte.  This time the guy behind the counter seems nice, albeit a little stressed since a line had formed and he was by himself.  When he finally called out for help, who should saunter to his aid?  That's right.  The same guy from before.  Only this time he wore a scowl and didn't speak to me while I waited patiently for my latte.  He brusquely handed me my latte and it was so hot I almost couldn't hold onto it.  And I have hands made out of asbestos.  When I finally got to try it, I realized this guy had given me the worst latte I've ever had.  I was freakin' Stumptown trained!  I know how their coffee should taste, and this was not it!  Now, I know it's easy to say that something is the \\"worst ever\\" without anything substantial backing it up, so I'm going to tell you why. 1) He made it an undrinkably hot temperature.  If you do this without proper aeration your milk will scald.  Which it did.  Gross.  2)  My latte was ridiculously foamy.  I've been known to drink cappuccinos.  I could've dealt with that.  Except, instead of the nice dense micro foam to which every Portlander has become accustomed, this latte had the strange foam that has an awful \\"mouth feel\\" and tasted sour.  3) He poured the shots directly into my cup.  This is fine if you pay attention and check the grind often.  But mine tasted weak and bitter.  A sure sign that the shots pulled way to fast.\\n\\nWhen I was finally able to try it, I gagged a little.  (No, I'm not exaggerating.  That's the price I pay for being obsessed with good coffee)  I even got other people to try it, offering this latte to anyone that wanted it.  No takers.  they all thought it was revolting.  One person said it tasted like an ashtray.  I threw my my latte away and sighed.  I had literally thrown money away."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I fancy myself a bit of a pizza snob (yes, I'm fully aware how annoying it is to listen to someone self-appoint himself as an expert), so I definitely had my critical hat on when I decided to try this place out.\\n\\nOne of my biggest complaints about Boston's food scene, in general, is that there seem to be very few mid-range restaurants outside of major chains.  Generally, your options are either diner/sandwich/burrito place or more upscale and expensive (and very rarely deservedly so), so I was very happy when I got to this place and found it to be both divey and relatively inexpensive.  Already this was shaping up to be something good.\\n\\nHere's a run-down of the good:\\n1. Super simple menu - Pizza, more pizza, and did I mention pizza?  there's a couple items that are grilled, but it's 95% pizza.  and you only get one size which simplifies it.\\n2. Beer and wine and liquor - they have all, but they're not pretending to be anything they're not.  three or four wines, and 7 or 8 beers (all domestic i think).\\n3. The interior - simple bar with painted wood paneling and photos of celebrities on the walls.\\n4.  The food - completely outstanding.  i've had some decent pizza in boston (upper crust), but nothing that knocks my socks off.  I appreciate when pizza places try to get creative with their toppings, but I feel like most sacrifice basics for artichoke hearts and artisanally-ground goat sausage.  This place has a killer crust (cornmeal on the bottom!!!), a really good sauce (a little sweet, but not cloying), and great toppings.  We had two pizzas: cheese with garlic and the works (including anchovies).  We universally agreed the cheese with garlic was better, but neither was bad.\\n5.  The service - the server was typical boston: a little bossy, attentive but never annoying interested in us.  her attitude worked.\\n\\nand the Bad:\\n1. The temperature - being seated under the a/c vent was crappy.  Asking to be moved and getting attitude about it was more crappy.  I don't want to be cold all meal long, and I definitely don't want my pizza to cool off faster than it would on it's own...\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a feeling i'll be going back here a lot.  better not get rid of my fat pants."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We came here as a last minute idea on a Sunday morning.

I would call these flavors a bit more adult, more sophisticated. Of course having said that, my husband and I tried the S'more Beer and the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch so possibly less sophisticated than the raspberry rosemary or the blueberry basil ones. \\n\\nThe big deal for me here is the quality of the product. The dough itself is really top notch, and the flavor of the dark valrhona chocolate combined with the vanilla cream inside (made with visible vanilla bean) was heavenly in that donut. I would definitely go back here if I was in the mood for a decadent, quality dessert (or breakfast!) to enjoy slowly with a coffee."},{"name":"Vancouver Christmas Market","address":"1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This year was my second time coming to the market. The first was last year mid-December at nighttime. It was a mad house. Still, I enjoyed it with all the lights lit up looking all Christmas-like. \\n\\nThis year I decided to take my son during the day so we could enjoy the market without the crowds. Going on opening day proved to be the right choice, as it was only $3 for me and no cost for him. Once inside, we were given two passes for a free carousel ride. Score! \\n\\nI have to say that bringing a child here must  be a lot more fun than for people without kids. My son was so interested in all of the stalls. He enjoyed seeing how the popcorn and spaetzle were made and loved all the Christmas decorations. It really is a joy to see Christmas through a child's eyes. \\n\\nThe Spaetzle with cheese and ham was delicious, although a bit pricey at $10 and something. Still, the ingredients were authentic and high quality. I liked this dish as it was just big enough for one adult and one child to share. My son devoured it.\\n\\nThe kiddie bratwurst was delicious again, but I believe the price has gone up, maybe even by a dollar more! Rip off. The ketchup and mustard machines are a riot though. Squeezing the ketchup bottle like a cow's utter was a crack up.\\n\\nThe popcorn we bought for $6 was a huge let down. It was a treat for my kid though, so why not. The white, green and red colours of the popcorn make it more of a novelty than anything.\\n\\nThe last place we went to was the gingerbread booth. I must give a big warning to parents. The gingerbread is authentic and spicy! Your child will probably not like it. Instead, our Minion-decorated cookie will be displayed on the tree this year with a child-sized bite on his head:)\\n\\nOverall, it was a fun day, but sadly not something I'd be willing to do twice a year to warrant using my re-entry pass.\\n\\nOh, and if you're looking for a washroom (there aren't any at the Market), the McDonalds just down the street at Robson and Hamilton has a nice clean washroom:)"},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Really nice little place, with lovely waitress, and good food (though the pasta was not superb), anyway a little bit pricey."},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We have been here several times now over the past year and a half and have never been disappointed.

We started off w the sambusa, equivalent to a crispy veg roll except its stuffed with ground beef. It comes with a dipping sauce that enhances the flavor. For our main dish, we each tried the fish and ground beef plate with a side of miser (spicy red lentil stew) injera (spongy  flatbread that's served rolled up) and rice.

Now this puts me in my element since I'm used to tearing up some food with my hands (love eating naan)! But my bf was a little uncomfortable so I told him to use the spoon that came with the rice. Im sure they'll give you silverware if you ask. The taste of injera does take some getting used to, bf preferred the meal without but I didn't mind it. Overall, loved the flavors and smells!

I enjoyed it a lot more because of the personalization.\\n\\nI ordered the signature tonkotsu ramen! On weekdays they have a couple lunch specials that are basically like add-ons. I got the \\"A\\" set which included 3 pan-fried Yaki Gyozas and a choice of a soft-boiled egg, nori, kikurage, or karashi takana. I love soft-boiled eggs so I couldn't resist. Usually it's $1.50 extra to add the egg. Next time, I think I'll order some extra noodles as well :)\\n\\nThe gyozas were okay at best, I'm not super into gyozas to begin with but I'm not a huge fan of scallions.

I was just literally starving to death the other night and looking for someplace in the neighborhood and there it was. I did not realize this was THE RICHARD BLAIS' new place, because I am apparently out of the loop. The small parking lot was full, but there is additional parking across the street. There were many people already waiting for tables by 7pm, but the hostess said if we were willing to sit outdoors, we could be seated immediately. (I have not noticed any other Yelpers mentioning the patio.) It was a rather breezy, chilly evening, but I had on a warm jacket and as I said --starving -- so we took one of several free tables. Now here's one probably insignificant detail, but nevertheless an irritant. There is a big metal gate from the patio to the parking lot. We were seated right next to it and within two minutes several people exited. Each time, it slammed shut with a huge brain-rattling BANG. I had to ask to be moved to another table. They are going to have to fix that gate. \\n\\nThe server was very knowledgeable and helpful. She explained the preparation of each dish by saying \\"Richard will do this\\" and \\"Richard will do that\\" until it began to get through to me. I happen to be a Top Chef fan and liked Blais a lot.  Now I understood the crowds and I also understood the complex, interesting and esoteric menu. This was not another version of Ruby Tuesdays.\\n\\nI don't think anyone has mentioned the corned beef and cabbage burger, topped with a poached egg. I can't get it out of my mind. It was just wonderful. I begrudged the tiny bite I offered my husband. He had the brisket burger. I think he really liked it and I think I had a bite, but I don't really remember. I did enjoy the tater tots.\\n\\nAlso, they have a whole list of \\"vintage\\" sodas available for $3 a pop (haha!) The server explained that Richard has somehow scoured the country and found cases of these no longer made drinks languishing in various warehouses, etc. I am skeptical that they would still be fizzy, much less safe to drink-- if they really are that old. Maybe she didn't understand what she was telling me. \\n\\nBasically, I liked Flip but I was too hungry to really evaluate it carefully. I have no idea if Mr. Blais was cooking that night.

Sooo many tables open. There were a few folks here and there, mostly grandparents. This is probably the best time to come since it can get really packed on weekends and evenings.\\n\\nWe decided to share an appetizer, so we got Schmidt's pretzel nuggets. So yum! They were warm and fresh and absolutely delightful! I'd come here again and again only to eat those! They came with honey mustard and then we added beer cheese. Oh, man! That beer cheese was the best decision ever! Boy, it was so good. Even better than the honey mustard.\\n\\nThey do buffet here, but eh! We weren't gonna do that. I ordered the German meatloaf, which was under the dinner section, I believe. It comes with sides, so I had applesauce, potato cakes (?), peas, and of course, they give you a roll. The meatloaf was so easy to eat and moist. The mushroom sauce on top gave it such a nice flavor too. My only complaint is the roll. Do people in Germany care for it? Cuz I don't. It was the most useless afterthought. I took one bite and that was the end of my meal. It's nothing special and didn't need to be there. Schmidt's could save a little more money and not serve any more rolls.\\n\\nMy friends got schnitzel and the sausage sampler. The schnitzel also had the mushroom sauce and was the star of my friend's plate! Oh, so good! She also had that obnoxious roll (which she also didn't finish, a clear reason why Schmidt's should stop serving them), green beans with spaetzle, and mashed potatoes. My friend's sausage sampler came with 4 halves of sausage, a different kind of bread which was buttered and looked much more appetizing, potato salad (she didn't care for), apple sauce, and sauerkraut. \\n\\nThe apple sauce blew me away.

Call ahead or check the other reviews on that.\\nGet this --- I ordered the half soup, half sandwich combo.  The soup - crawfish!!!   That's what I said:  crawfish.  Now don't go thinking gumbo.  No.  It's like a crawfish take on lobster bisque.  Rich and creamy with nice pieces of crawfish in there, piping hot.  For my sandwich I had the shrimp po-boy.

The garnishes fresh and crisp too.  \\nThis place has a side's bar that's a meal on it's own, complimentary.

They had a very small menu comparatively, but what they had was rockin'. They didn't have barrels of pickles, or specialty items or a full line of cheeses, but they have a nice little selection of cold drinks, and cold salads and such. As my son is a pesto freak, we decided to share the Mohawk Stroller. I thought it was very good, but my son had problems fitting the big chewy roll into his mouth. He said he would get it on a slice of bread next time. The staff were very friendly and good with my son too. Altogether it was a good experience and I think it's a cool little deli.

Funny thing is the one of four tables outside was not being used, but left unclean, had been used by the bartender and her 2 kids prior to us getting there. Long story short, she was inside taking shots while her 2 kids were playing outside and I am waiting for a table, buttt whatever, I can be understanding and decided to let it slide..\\n\\nEventually, went inside to ask the waitress if the table could be cleaned so we could have dinner. She explained to me that it was being used by the bartender of the restaurant but she would try to clean it... \\n\\nThe girl taking shots with 2 guys at the bar, who apparently was the bartender came and cleaned our table and seated us and brought us menus and explained to us that there had been other tables there that had been there longer than she and her kids had been there. And I have to say, it was pretty awkward to have to pull the girl thats taking shots with patrons by the bar away from that, and have her come outside and have her kids help her clean the table for us only to turn around and seat us. Decided to just get over how awkward this was already getting sat down, told her it was ok, and starting looking over the menu...\\n\\nWe ordered our food, the waitress was nice enough. My boyfriend and I began having a conversation and cracking some jokes with eachother, as couples dating 7yrs tend to. Our food came (which was soggy) and I decided to go wash my hands, came back 30 seconds later to find the table next to us had started picking a fight with my bf about our conversation 30seconds earlier saying that he was being a prick and that I had no class for being with someone like my bf. He begins to tell me that he feels sorry for me that I am dating such a prick -- I believe those were his exact words. Mind you-- these are people I have never seen before. At this point I am trying to calm down 2 grown men that starting to consider fight each other. The manager at this point pops her head out just in time to see this happening and she decideds shes going to come out and introduce herself to the table next to us and buy them a round of drinks!!! \\n\\nAt this point I am so absolutely livid and crying because here were are trying to have dinner, and this table of drunk guys that we dont know decide to give us their opinion on my relationship, telling my bf that he is a prick, and that I have no class, and the manager is BUYING THEM A ROUND!  I went inside to talk to her and get her reasoning as to why she felt they deserved a round of drinks after this kind of behavior. She tried to give me some excuse about them owning the building next door, and how they get free parking for their patrons. As far as I am concerned the 2 hour free parking outside is plenty of time and has never been an issue for me ever before in all 3 times I have come there before. I told her this made no sense to me, and she began repeating herself and raising her voice at me. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will never be going there ever again. This was hands down the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant ever, and I am NEVER going to this restaurant again. I have never been so disrespected by a business/their employees."},{"name":"Hi Hat Public House","address":"2121 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"A very cozy atmosphere with a  wonderful selection of beer on tap.

So with all the rave reviews on here, I came back determined to find something delicious. We got there at 11:30 for lunch on a Friday. One of the first ones in, we sat down and decided what we wanted to order. The waiter took our order and brought us our drinks promptly. As time passed, we gabbed and just enjoyed the moment, but as time went on and people who arrived after us received their food - it was hard not to notice. It was now 12:15 - (forty-five minutes later) we waived down a waitress, who snidely told us that they were very busy. (Yes - so busy people who arrived after us had their food, and we just ordered sandwiches). Finally our food arrived, and it was hardly worth the wait. My sandwich was cold and dry, and not even worth mentioning only for the fact that it was a complete disappointment.

I had a pasta dish in a watery sauce. For the price ($24), not good. My wife had trout ($25); Same problem - little flavor.

Anyone who knows me knows that my weakness is for a good donut so on a recent visit to Portland, I had to try a Blue Star Donut. Yelper buddy Lyla D. reminded me to find and devour one of these great donut gems or I'd regret it and the visit would leave me unfulfilled.  So like a man on a mission, I ferreted out the closest Blue Star Donut location. \\n\\nNow just down the street from Powell's Books is where I found Blue Star Donuts. Their popularity cannot be denied as they have more locations than other Donut shops and are even located in LA and Japan too.  The other major player, Voo Doo Donuts has a more whimsical bent towards their offerings,  but the donuts themselves are just OK.  (More hype than substance) Blue Star seems to focus on developing the right combination of flavors and tastes to be savored by all. But since this review is about Blue Star, on with the review:\\n\\nWe visited the Washington street location on a late Saturday afternoon which meant some flavors were sold out and not available.  We focused on the pumpkin cake donut seasonal special  and several chocolate variations in both the cake and brioche (yeast like) variety.  \\n\\nPrices ranged from $2.75 to $3.75 per donut, prices that put us in the range of some cupcake places.  The quality of the offerings cannot be denied.  High grade flavorings and ingredients?  Yes it's here. The flavors and textures work well, you can tell it's not some random combination of stuff that was thrown together.  \\n\\nNow about the donuts we tried:\\n\\nChocolate Almond Ganache (brioche) the chocolate ganache glaze was as rich and flavorful as expected, the brioche donut was airy, not too heavy, the almond sprinkles added a nice touch.\\n\\nMexican Hot Chocolate (cake)- deceptively simple cake donut with a spicy chocolate glaze. This one worked well with the cake donut, I don't think it would have done as well with the brioche donut.\\n\\nPumpkin Cheesecake (brioche) delicious pumpkin flavored glaze with pumpkin seeds sprinkled on the top.  The cheesecake filling was subtle and not too sweet for a donut.\\n\\nValrhona chocolate crunch (brioche) chocolate coating sprinkled with crunchy choco beads about the size of a BB gun pellet (am I showing my age?) with the high grade valhrona chocolate glaze and the vanilla cream filling, this donut was the sweetest of the bunch.\\n\\nThe combination of flavors, textures, fillings and coatings make Blue Star a go-to donut destination.  The ones we tried were all good donuts- coupled with straight black coffee (no cream or sugar please) they are the perfect combination of beverage and snack.\\n\\nWhen in Portland, Blue Star is my donut of choice. And my favorite? The Mexican Hot Chocolate- yum!"},{"name":"Southland Whiskey Kitchen","address":"1422 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Just got back from dinner and was pleasantly surprised!\\n\\nFood was reasonably priced, good atmosphere, overall nice dinner and a nice time.\\n\\nMy friend and I split a small brisket with beans and onion rings and a small pulled pork with mac and cheese and grit sticks. \\n--The onion rings were huge!

After receiving the menu, I was disappointed to find out that the only meat available in the ramen dishes was pork belly. I seriously dislike fatty meats. I mean seriously - fat on meat is my kryptonite! Even when I occasionally eat bacon, it has to be cooked completely crisp, with no white wiggly fat at all. But out of respect after they had served us water and brought us a menu, I decided to try it and do my best. I was impressed with the choice they offered of different styles of broth, preparations and extra toppings. Being a total chili head, I ordered the Killer Spicy Ramen. The broth was pleasantly and even unbelievably flavorful, and the level of chili for my chili head palate was perfect. The ramen noodles were just perfect in texture and flavor. The dish appeared to also have some ground pork, which was delicious. Fortunately, I only had to deal with one chunk of pork belly, which appeared to me to be basically a mass of fat. I shoved it to the side and could not bear to shove it in my mouth and anticipate a gag response. But, no doubt, I'm sure the pork belly was responsible for imparting much of the flavor in the stock that I was totally enjoying.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable. We were quickly seated, service was on point and the wait staff were wonderful. The prices were right. I do not knock them for the pork belly, since many people like that. I only wish that they had some other meat choices that are healthier, and that would appeal to a broader crowd. Would I go back? Heck yeah, but the person next to me is welcome to snag my chunk of pork belly."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I need to preface this review by saying I've visited Gus's twice... in one day.\\n\\nOne good word for this place is \\"wow\\".

Even more, I LOVE Tennessee hot chicken, and I was SO happy that this southern brand of fried chicken made the move to Austin!\\n\\nGus's Fried Chicken is freshly cooked to order, so while you may have to wait for your food a little longer, it is definitely worth the wait. The freshly made chicken ensures that your chicken is not only hot (temperature and taste-wise!), but extremely moist when you get it. Typically, fried chicken is dried out when purchased from chains. Not so from Gus's! I guarantee that your chicken will be so hot and moist that you'll have to wait a couple of minutes to start eating, if you can wait that long.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're downtown and want good, fairly quick food, but don't want KFC, Popeyes, or anything gross, head down to Gus's.

Now, I'm a huge fan of rotisserie or roasted chicken in general, but the herbs seasoning Terra's dish were spot on.

It was a Saturday, my group was told of the 2.5-hour wait, and given our collective hunger we beelined for another restaurant.  Fast forward to last night--another Saturday night--a slight improvement to a 1.5-hour wait, but this time we were determined.\\n\\nWe grabbed a couple beers to pass the time and in between conversation watched MTV2 on plasma screens mounted under ornate portrait frames.  Loud, mainly electronic music made conversation a little tough but keeps the energy high.  The narrow lobby and bar area were shoulder-to-shoulder our entire wait.  It was not uncommon to be bumped by staff and patrons as they entered and exited the dining room.  Patience, my friends.\\n\\nAt long last, we were seated at the chef's table.  The chef's table is a smaller bar in the back of the restaurant, facing the kitchen and prep area in the foreground.  It was fascinating to watch the speed with which entrees were prepared, in contrast to the time spent waiting for them.  Let's face it, though, seating isn't abundant and we found the food to be worth the wait.\\n\\nWe shared three sides--fried pickles with buttermilk ranch (4/5), jalapeno slaw (3.5/5) and tempura-fried rutabaga with red pepper jam (5/5).  For entrees, I ordered the butcher's cut burger with blue cheese and carmelized onion--wow--and my dining companion ordered the Korean BBQ burger and practically inhaled it.  Our service was friendly and attentive.\\n\\nThe gravy, if you will, was our shakes.  The Nutella shake with burnt marshmallows was heavenly.  The Turtle shake was sugar coma-inducing, being much sweeter due to the caramel, but still delicious.\\n\\nWhile Flip is worth the wait, a weeknight may be better if time isn't on your side.

I must say one of the guys behind the bar was super friendly the other guy and girl not so much. They made us feel uncomfortable like we weren't welcome there. Despite this we decided to have some dinner and ordered the burgers and chips. They were fantastic but the best part of the whole experience were the homemade pickles.....probably the best I've ever had. So I give this place a 3 our of 5 stars because of the customer service issues."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"The best place for table service lunch/dinner in Animal Kingdom. (Disney Dining plan accepted.)\\n\\nGood asian fusion food. We had the fried green beans, lettuce wraps, potstickers, fried rice, duck and honey chicken. (All of which were delicious!) For dessert, the fried wontons are a must.\\n\\nI always look forward to this place when I am Disney."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Barley swine has an local farm-to-table menu.

Ordering was even a borderline pleasant experience.  \\n\\nSet your expectations to \\"average\\", and they will be exceeded.  Just like reading my reviews."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place did not disappoint. I started with the salad of the day, an apple and orange slice with mixed greens and goat cheese affair that was very good. There were lots of seafood options on the printed menu, but I went with the special: seafood ravioli (I think it was crab stuffing, but I could be remembering wrong) with chopped scampi in a cream sauce. It was just plain wonderful. It was too rich to finish, so I got to have a nice lunch the next day with the leftovers (a common occurrence with many Italian restaurants, as the servings are usually larger than one should eat by themselves).\\n\\nIf I lived in Austin, I'd probably eat here regularly."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place.

He's not really a big fan of Mexican food but I walked by the place this morning while running an errand for work and looked at the menu. It seemed simple enough and it looked very affordable. We went at about 14h and it was basically dead. It's basically a Tex-Mex place, with more emphasis on the Tex part.\\n\\nWe both originally wanted sangrias but he was skeptical of the place so I got one to try and then he would decide. It was a decent size with strawberries, blackberries, and an orange slice floating around in it. He didn't like it so he got himself a Stella Artois instead. I enjoyed it, minus the bits of berries getting stuck in the straw. I ordered a second one regardless.  \\n\\nWe got the Guacamole appetizer which was great for the two of us. Lots of chips and the guacamole was quite delicious, we continued eating it throughout our meal, there was so much of it. My Dad got the California Chicken sandwich and I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Both came with a good serving of fries that we dipped in the guacamole long after we were done with the sandwiches. \\n\\nMy Buffalo Chicken sandwich has the option to be either fried or grilled. I got mine grilled and it came out just perfect. The buffalo sauce was tasteful without being overpowering. The meal was surprisingly filling. It turned out to be pricier than I had thought (math - how does it work?), but we left satisfied. \\n\\nMy only complaints was that service was kind of slow considering there were two other tables besides us and also the whole staff (all girls) were in yoga attire basically. I am all for having a very casual dress code depending on the establishment and this one definitely applies, but the fact that the hostess, our waitress, and the bartender looked like they were going to the gym together right after work simply looks very unprofessional."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The best food tacos in Austin - I'm from Los Angeles and quite a foodie as well as a cook & this place was so flavorful - had the Migas - & it was by far the best breakfast taco I had - handmade tortillas - amazing salsas - and the aguas frescas!!!

I tried the four they had available: Passion Fruit, Blueberry, Maple Bacon, and a plain glaze. The doughnuts themselves were fantastic, nice and soft and buttery. The blueberry and maple bacon were also great, but the passion fruit was a little too sweet. The plain donut was exactly that, plain and donut-y. Still quite tasty.

When a place is this popular, it's easy to become critical of things that are run really well... however, all I saw at Hopdoddy was expertly managed crowds, great service, and freaking legendary food. I ordered an \\"almond joy\\" milkshake (a special), and it blew my mind. I mean, I was in pain from the dairy for the next 2 hours, but it was totally worth it. \\nThe Magic Shroom burger is the stuff of dreams. Perfectly balanced and just so, so good. I don't eat lots of burgers, but it was worth it to venture into the world of meat, if only for the deliciousness of this one burger. They suggest ordering medium, but I probably should have gone med-rare, as that's generally how I like burgers. Oh well, it was still great. \\nDon't forget to order fries!"},{"name":"Chutneys","address":"142 Mitchell St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The food at Chutneys is always exquisite. It is buffet style, all you can eat with dessert. I come here for lunch at least once a week.  This place makes me happy.  The GULAB JAMUN (dessert balls) and rice pudding for dessert are just heavenly.  If you love Indian food you will love Chutneys.  Don't pay any mind to the mean reviews.

The noodles seemed pretty authentic if a tad thin, but the overall dish was good.  The broth was tasty, and the chili oil was enough to pop your mouth but not enough to destroy you.  I did finish my broth, as is my wont, and I think my mouth started to go numb just as I finished it.  Didn't break a sweat though.  The beef was tender and tasty as well.  Good balance.  Could have used some more noodles or beef, but hey, I'm full, and now I need to try other establishments to compare their hand-pulled noodles and dish ingredient balance to Xian's."},{"name":"Bauhaus Restaurant","address":"1st W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We come from the land of a million restaurants and we have eaten in some mighty fine ones.

Given all the reviews already submitted about Mr. Blais's new spot, I'll get right to the highlights and key points of our experience . . . \\n\\nI started with an app - the roasted mushrooms. DIVINE. Seriously, if you like mushrooms, get this bowl of mixed fancy 'shrooms, which have been roasted in butter, set aside, then warmed/roasted again with a bit more butter. Ahhhh.\\n\\nMain meal . . . I love burgers. While Emily had been before and went with the highly popular lamb burger (she loved it), since it was my first visit I had to go with the basics and get the Flip burger - lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and Flip sauce. Quite tasty and, honestly, perfectly sized. I actually ate half there and the rest when I got home. Bun, toasted just right; lettuce, bibb, a very nice treat! Fries, most excellent, and of perfect thickness and seasoning. And, yeah, the smoky mayo that comes with is that good. And I don't even like mayonnaise.\\n\\nI didn't get a shake because I got two cocktails - the Manhattan (good, but strong enough that I had to drink it too slowly for my tastes) and the oh-so-delectable Sweet Tea. If you haven't tried Firefly sweet tea vodka, go buy some, now, and pour it over ice with a little water and some lemon. Or, go to Flip and have them make this mixed drink on the menu. You will be very pleased.\\n\\nEmily got a special version of the listed Hazelnut & Toasted Marshmellow shake (ask and they might make it for you, too!) - a vanilla shake with just Toasted Marshmellow. Kudos, kudos, she said!\\n\\nBartenders were friendly, gracious and efficient. It wasn't super crowded but everything seemed to hum right along.
