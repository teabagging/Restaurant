The space is gigantic, with a huge outdoor deck and then multiple large rooms inside. The outdoor area seemed like a perfect space for a nice day, complete with fire pit for when it gets cooler.

When we did approach the gentleman asked us to wait a min- as he was training a new employee on how to make a salad. I think that was VERY wrong. He should have paused his lesson and helped us immediately. We ordered penne with marinara sauce. He called it a build your own- but we added nothing. It should simply be the same price as the plain pasta bowls with sauce. On that section you can get Alfredo, pesto, etc but not marinara? Next up I ordered a build your own pasta bowl. I added various veggies and the servings were tiny! The entree itself was quite large- they give you a large amount of pasta. If you want a larger serving of toppings you need to pay more. Seems a bit cheap and skimpy to me. We also ordered an Italian Sandwich- which my husband enjoyed. We ordered the strawberry Nutella flatbread for dessert.

Each of the three dining rooms has distinct features. The Grand Ballroom is the largest and most elegant. If you can score a table against the glass windows in the back you will see the \\"snow\\" falling. The Rose Garden is the least inventive, and the most casual. It's just mounted paintings surrounding the dancing figures of Beast & Belle. The West Wing is definitely the room with the coolest vibe. It's dark. The rose is on display. Claw-gashed coat of arms and prince paintings are on display. \\n\\nThe decor earns five stars. The ordering technology -- while not perfect -- is also a hit. Disney has been rolling out self-serve computerized kiosks for some time, but this raises the bar since the RFID chip (a \\"rose\\") is simply placed on the table and your food will be carted out to you 10-15 minutes later in a glass-covered rolling server. \\n\\nIf you want to see it in action, here it is:\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIe_OtgmRnE\\n\\nService is very efficient, though at least on 11/3 it was still a bit hazy. Unlike other Disney counter-service locations, they seemed to allow refills. They also weren't checking receipts so folks could very easily be taking drinks and coffee cups that they didn't order (since the cups were just there for the taking by the soda and java dispensers).\\n\\nThe food was the real letdown. We were coming off a late breakfast -- and didn't expect the restaurant to be open during the passholder preview -- so we just ordered sandwiches. The steak sandwich was decent. Garlic herb butter is a nice touch. The croque monsieur was a bit of a letdown. Yes, it was gruyere and with bechamel sauce, but on a whole wheat bread? Where the melted cheese over the bread? \\n\\nBoth came with a choice of green beans or pomme frites. I know I wasn't expecting hand-cut fries but these were the same limp fries that they serve throughout Disney. $10.99 seems a bit much for what it is. \\n\\nClearly the dinner sit-down service is going to be a hot ticket, and the counter service lunch is going to be crazy crowded with a real bottleneck at the ordering stations (because the capacity itself is huge). On ambiance alone, it's worth a visit -- just study the menu beforehand to make sure that you get the most bang for your buck. \\n\\nReading up before a meal? Belle would approve."},{"name":"The Consulate","address":"10 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I typically don't leave reviews but I feel compelled to leave one for this restaurant.

The waitress seemed more interested in the back lounge area and passed us up without so much as a friendly greeting or a second cup of coffee. 25 minutes into waiting the cook finally had to come over and take our order, being very hungry I was disappointed to hear that it would be a while since there was a large table with orders in front of us. I would have been more understanding except for the fact that as I sat with my empty coffee cup waiting for a refill I watched all those people come in and go to the back to sit down. The waitress who had completely ignored us had seated them, given them coffee, and taken their order.\\n    We finally got our food (chicken fried steak) The steak was good, gravy good too. The eggs were slightly over cooked but still pretty decent and the toast wasn't very good. \\n As I sat and ate I watched an older couple that were regulars walk out and one of the parties from the large table in the back ask about her food and then take it to go since she ran out of time. \\n  All and all I would rate the cook as decent, friendly and efficient.

I liked the fact that there was a diversity of proteins with this offering and I liked the barbecued pork, as it resembled bacon. The chicken wasn't too dry but that's probably because the soup provided tons of support. The shrimp was tiny but decently grilled. The chikuwa and egg provided some semblance of authenticity. With the small portion of ramen, even though you get a wide-range of food on that ramen, it leaves you feeling lacking. \\n\\nThe dining is clean, vast but perhaps sterile for some. Service was okay. Price-point isn't exactly attractive and I'd rather spend my money now down-the-street...at Santouka.\\n\\n2.5 stars"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"3325 SE Division St, Ste 1","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best doughnuts in the world.

The passionfruit had a lovely yet unexpected kick of cayenne pepper. \\n\\nNot only was I won over by the unique flavors of Blue Star, but texture of doughnuts was on point (unlike some other Portland-born doughnut brands, sorry it's just so sunny right now in the middle of July...).

Since its opening along with the expanded Fantasyland, the restaurant has almost instantaneously become the top dining destination in the Magic Kingdom. This shouldn't really come as a surprise, though; the Magic Kingdom is quintessential Disney World, and when you combine that with arguably the greatest animated feature Disney has released, you have gold.\\n\\nThe restaurant is modeled after the Beast's castle. Most of the tables are located in the large center ballroom, with more located in two side rooms. We were seated in the main dining room, which pretty much looked exactly like the ballroom in the movie. Disney does details really well, and they didn't let me down here. One of the side dining rooms is modeled after the west wing which I thought was super cool - really dark and dilapidated with the classic rose and hand mirror from the movie - I really wish I was seated there instead of the main ballroom. Because it's so big and open, the restaurant is loud (think food hall/cafeteria noise) - but they try to offset that a little by playing music from the movie. \\n\\nOur server highly recommended the French onion soup, so that's what I started with. The soup was okay - there was lots of melty cheese which I appreciated, but it didn't have a lot of flavor - I've had better. For my main I had the pork chop which was served with a sauce and succotash. This was better than the soup, the pork was tender with good flavor and the succotash and sauce were tasty as well. For dessert, I couldn't resist getting the grey stuff (again, taken from the movie). I'm not really sure what the grey stuff is - it has the consistency of mousse and was piped on top of a brownie-cookie. The grey stuff itself didn't have much flavor, but the cookie it sat on saved the dessert.  \\n\\nOur server was friendly and engaging, as I expected. You'll definitely get that Disney magic at Be Our Guest. The food isn't out of this world, but you won't leave disappointed either.

The pizza was ready at 7:20. He was still waiting on his wings and my chicken hoagie. Our kids were growing impatient and restless. At 7:42, almost ONE HOUR since I placed the order, the rest of the food was ready. Husband frustrated, kids hungry, he finally got home with the food. The pizza was cold and soggy and my chicken hoagie was so salty, it was almost inedible. I'm not sure what Mellow Mushroom's obsession is with salt. Funny thing is, my 8-yr-old son was against Mellow Mushroom from the start because he said they take too long. We should have listened to the young one.

We've been here a few times before and absolutely loved the food and the service!  We are from the Bay Area, however make it a point to always eat here for dinner during our stay.  As expected, the food was fantastic and the drinks were spot on.  Sadly, our waiter seemed new and didn't offer a very hospitable experience.  For the lack of words, we became the forgotten table.  I had to ask other waiters to locate ours, so that we could order additional items or drinks.  The most shocking of our visit, is that our waiter offered complimentary ice cream (which was appreciated), however within the ice cream there is what appeared to be a glass or plastic shard.  Fortunately, when I eat my ice cream I don't immediately swallow it and typically let it melt in my mouth.  Thank god I did that this time!  I immediately felt something odd in my mouth and took it out and was absolutely disturbed at what I found.  At this point, I was unable to determine if it was glass or plastic, however you could not easily break it.  I placed the piece on the spoon I was using and immediately wanted to ask for a Manager, however our waiter had stopped by at this point to which I brought the situation to his attention.  He immediately went to the kitchen and then shortly stepped behind the bar area to speak to someone (appeared to be a Manager and/or Supervisor?).  I immediately saw a phone come out and I tend to have good hearing and they were reviewing our bill (out loud) and determined the most appropriate solution was to comp. our drinks.  We had 2 Sparkling Wines and 1 Cocktail.  The Manager/Supervisor stepped over to our table to politely inform me that after research, it was NOT glass, however it was plastic.  I felt as if I should of had a sense of relief.  However, the fact your acknowledging what happened and confirming it was plastic, your intuition of making things right is to comp 3 drinks?  Don't get me wrong, I've very appreciative of the gesture of goodwill.  However, considering the severity to which I described, this is something I could had swallowed that would had placed me into the hospital in a foreign country and ultimately would had caused some type of bodily harm.  It was beyond me as to why we paid for any portion of our bill.  With tip (yes, I even tipped) the total cost ended up being around $39.22 USD.  When you consider the bodily harm that could had taken place and I was not from Vancouver, one would think that a $39.22 USD bill could be comped.  I politely explained the circumstances to the Manager/Supervisor, however it just didn't \\"click\\".  I am not sure what the law is in Vancouver, but I'm sure I probably could had taken my concerns forward to some type of entity.  Regardless, I was polite in my interactions, thanked them for the free drinks and went about my night.  However, I was displeased as to how I let the situation go so easily and the lack of responsibility the Restaurant took of the situation.  There are a few ways one could make this right.  You could either comp. the entire bill, offer an explanation as to what happened and we move forward OR comp. the entire bill and provide a gift certificate as to make the experience right again and to promote your return and most likely prevent reviews such as this.  Regardless, that DID NOT happen and I'm very disappointed.

Still, even with the reservation, we stood in line for nearly an hour (about a half hour outside and another half hour inside, waiting in line near the talking suits of armor). Cast members were coming around apologizing for the wait. I'm not sure what was going on.\\n\\nOrdered our food at the kiosks, and then it was seat yourself (and they find you and wheel out your food using your magic band tech). However when we went looking for a table - even though only about half the tables in the place were taken across the 3 rooms - we had trouble finding a clean one. We kind of stood off to the side for 5 minutes waiting for one to get cleaned, until just sitting at a dirty table and pushing the leftover trash to the side, because we were scared our food was going to come out on the carts and we were just going to be standing awkwardly somewhere. \\n\\nAt this point, I wasn't exactly enjoying my experience at all, but the food came out and was actually pretty good! The croque monsieur wasn't traditional, it was just a grilled cheese with ham and Gruyere on it (and apparently b√©chamel in there somewhere, though I couldn't tell), but it was very tasty and perfectly griddled. It looked just ok, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The fries it came with were tasty also - think thin McDonald's style fries. (Disney tip - if you want a traditional croque monsieur, get one at Les Halles Boulangerie Patisserie in Epcot France! It's $8.75 there instead of $13.99 at BOG, and much better, even though the BOG one was good for what it was, aka a grilled cheese).\\n\\nI was however disappointed by their signature Master's Cupcake with Lumi√®re's special \\"grey stuff\\" frosting. The grey stuff didn't taste like very much (think a very vaguely cookies and cream flavored whipped cream) and the chocolate cake was dry. It was also $5 and maybe a 2 bite cupcake. When it came out it looked like a mini cupcake. More of a gimmick to try the \\"gray stuff, it's delicious!\\" than anything else, IMO.\\n\\nStill, in the end my main meal was good and it was nice to come here to see the inside of the restaurant. The ceiling is beautiful, as is the falling snow in the windows. They just need to bus it better. Definitely worth going at least once to check it out, but there's definitely better and more affordable places in Magic Kingdom to get lunch."},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriend and I were referred to Boma by a member of the Disney staff. Seeing the 4 star review and a $40 price point per person, we expected this buffet to not disappoint.  We came without a reservation and were seated very quickly. When we went up to the buffet, we quickly noticed the lack of variety. After picking a few different dishes we found the food to be dry or poorly executed. We resorted to eating the food prepared for children such as Mac and cheese and tomato pasta.

After exhausting our possibilities of trying to eat at the buffet, I went to speak to the manager.

She kept repeating this throughout our conversation and even stated that if we wanted something more to our standards, we could have a cheeseburger at one of Disney's food courts.  \\n    After leaving the restaurant, my girlfriend started to feel very stomach sick and ran to the closest bathroom.    I returned to Boma to notify them that the food made her sick, and the staff was no where to be found. \\nHowever, I would give the hotel staff 5 stars for they completely made up for the customer service that the restaurant lacked. They were very kind and did anything they could to help my girlfriend and I be more comfortable after all the frustration we had at Boma. \\n Overall the quality of food and pretentious manager at Boma is far from what we expected from Disney. \\nThe comments the manager made were snobby and arrogant.

It is a little pricey for two people, since you need to order a lot of food to be full, and my girlfriend and I needed to get separate broths since she is a vegetarian. Since that first time, we have brought groups of friends (5-7).

The char belly was just meh it was your standard fish dish nothing special nothing terrible. Dessert on the other hand was amazing. Couldn't choose one so we got both the donuts and cheesecake. The donuts were a surprising portion.. I assumed it would be like munchkin size but no, it was 3 huge donuts that reminded me of churros.

Located in the Animal Kingdom Lodge, this spot is worth the trip regardless of where you're staying if you're looking for a nice reprieve from the madness of the parks. The service is on point, the food is delicious, but understandably pricey. \\n\\nTaste of Africa - this sampler platter comes with a mix of fairly familiar appetizer foods (eg hummus), but also ventures to less familiar options such as duck sausage. Despite that, in the end, not that adventurous, but an enjoyable spread of meats, cheeses, and breads. I'm unsure if this counts as having sampled more authentic African food, but either way, very enjoyable and a good start to a great meal. \\n\\nOak Grilled Filet - a nice sized, and excellently cooked cut of high quality filet served atop a bed of gourmet 4 cheese Mac and cheese. The meat was incredibly tender, well-seasoned, and well-sauced. Wouldn't change much about this entree. If you're on the hunt for a well-executed steak, this may be one of the best places to find it at Disney. \\n\\nSeafood Curry - as the only seafood option on the menu, this might be the best option for you if you're not  in the mood for a plate of lamb, chicken, or red meat (there is a vegetarian option, but I frankly never even considered that). There is a generous potion of calamari, shrimp, mussels, and a perfectly cooked lobster tail all served in a velvety smooth coconut milk based broth. The broth is on the sweet side of curry, but not problematically so. Not too much in the way of heat so even as a curry, it is a good option for even those who might be scared away by the possibility of too much spice. \\n\\nWe had our dinner paired with a glass of mixed red South African wine. Our wine was probably on the cheaper end of their spectrum of offerings, but it was an excellent wine option. I can't be certain, but I imagine they have lots of higher end wine offerings if that's your style. \\n\\nIn the end, a great option for a fine dining experience in Disney.

I don't normally love mousse, but the play of the textures from the mousse, the chocolate cookie-esque base, and the pistachio financier, helped to cut the boring creaminess of any average mousse. \\n\\nI love this place and couldn't recommend it more!"},{"name":"Rush Bowls","address":"1110 Hammond Dr, Ste 25","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my favorite smoothie/bowl place everything is fresh fruits and juices also the people that work here are awesome they remember my name and my order from the first day I came in.i definitely recommend this place for a healthy breakfast lunch or dinner"},{"name":"Gami Sushi","address":"10111 Number 3 Road, Suite 126","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm actually pretty happy I found out about this place. There aren't many sushi places in Richmond that I've been to and enjoyed. But this one is definitely a good choice and a place I'd want to come back to.\\n\\nIt was pretty busy when I went. You have to write your name down on the whiteboard. There's a piece of paper above it that has a few words about writing your name legibly and making sure you're around to hear your name called. For a table for two, we waited around 15 minutes. We were seated and servers kept asking if we were ready to order. I think three different servers asked. I can understand that they want quick turnover, but it felt like a bit much. But at least they were attentive.\\n\\nWe ended up getting the deluxe chirashi don, ebi mayo, gomae, chopped scallop nigiri, aburi salmon nigiri, aburi toro nigiri, and hamachi nigiri. The aburi is just am additional 50 cents and can only be done on tuna, salmon, toro, hamachi, or chopped scallop. Their nigiris are quite reasonably priced, even with the added on 50 cents. I thought they were pretty tasty. My friend said the hamachi was just OK though. The gomae was pretty basic and was tasty. The chirashi don was nicely presented and had lots of variety. The fish tasted fresh and the portion was quite big. The ebi mayo was interesting because it is tempura prawn but wrapped with strings of sweet potato that is also deep fried. It was cool to try but a little difficult to eat because of the sweet potato.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was very satisfying for a reasonable price. For the two of us, it was about 50 with tax and tip. Definitely an affordable and tasty place."},{"name":"iTofu","address":"4940 No.3 Road, Unit 125","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Excellent! Very light and creamy.

But tonight my boyfriend and I popped in, and the food was very unappealing. The green salad was just okay. The shrimp were well flavored, but with very little meat. But the cod was disappointing--soggy, light on flavor and fat, with a very fishy taste. The paparadelle was also heavy on salt and light on flavor. And while the restaurant kindly took the fish back (I don't know if I've ever sent back food before because I didn't like it), the replacement was still subpar for the price. The pork belly was tough and again the risotto was mostly salty with pickles on top that sort of overpowered. Maybe it was just an off night, but for $91 with tip (and no drinks), we were hoping to leave feeling excited. But instead we decided we probably won't go back.

I'm the kinda person that can go from Jungle Fever to the Waltz, because I'm pretty eclectic in comfort when it comes to atmosphere...but I think the only people that would hang out here for long periods of time are those interested in chasing some ass.  No greeting or recognition from ANYONE upon entry & after about 15 minutes of waiting at our table I finally asked a server at the bar if we could get some service.  10 minutes later someone came over to take the order & 15 minutes after that our drinks arrive and my drink (all 3 ingredients of it) is wrong.  When I point it out to the waiter he acts as if it's MY problem & 5 minutes later returns & without looking at me at all says \\"NOW it's got some cranberry in it DOESN'T it!\\" - What the hell did I do to you? The drink was wrong... you can SEE cranberry in a clear drink ya ass!

Now, I kinda like this style a little, I mean... I get used to it quick, but MOST people would be sorta uncomfortable.  Certainly the meat market has gotta be the only thing the repeat offenders in the place seem to be interested in because it's not the service or the prices!\\n\\nAfter another 20-25 minutes my date & I were concerned of whether or not we were going to make it home for the late show, but finally our food showed up.  Over an hour and we still had empty stomachs and only one visit from our waiter - hmmmm.  The ONLY redeeming quality this place has to offer a patron is the good taste of what comes on the plate for an entree, though my date HATED the fondue & I had to eat the whole thing.  Our waiter did check back & even took an empty plate or two, but seemed annoyed when we didn't want to order anything else from the bar, yet relieved to be able to leave quickly.  My date wanted to leave no tip. He paid by card & simply rounded up the amount to charge to make the tip merely change... I can't do that & have a good conscious; I put two bucks on the table as we left out of pity for the ass that scowled at me and the karma that may come from his inner turmoil over serving something to a sexy vixen that has red juices trickling through the top...

Don't be surprised if staff get frustrated with you when you ignore their only rule. \\n\\nI love Bon's because I know, weather I'm doing well or am totally broke, there is still a place in Vancouver where I can go to get a nice, hot meal."},{"name":"Kawa Sushi","address":"5088 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This time I used pickup order and very pleased with friendly and fast service. \\n\\nMy western friend and me have similar idea for sushi :no crazy mayonnaise or chili sauce for it.

Everything tasted so delicious and had big portion. \\n\\nEspecially I liked Honto Roll. It was wrapped with smoked salmon and already slightly salty. You don't need much soy sauce. \\n\\nAlso More Crunchy roll became another favorite. Wrapped with grilled unagi and avocado? Forget about calories!

The restaurant is crowded, and you are expected to find a seat yourself. Thankfully, our party was only 5 people and there was fair turnaround but when we rushed to snag a table we were (calmly) yelled at that we couldn't sit down until someone came and cleaned it. Which I definitely appreciate, there just has to be a better way to do this.\\n\\nThe food itself was mediocre. It was nice to have some fresh greens but everything, including the French onion soup, was cold. They were accommodating about sending another one out but meh. They grey stuff was also way overhyped and turned out to be an average chocolate cupcake with sugary sweet icing.\\n\\nThere is a really nice, immersive Beauty and the Beast atmosphere that is fun to explore closer to closing when it gets emptier.

It's a pain finding a restaurant that we all like especially since my parents stick to \\"halal\\" but after reading about Waiypoint's fantastic seafood we decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nWe had a 8:45 pm reservation. When we showed up our table wasn't ready and were told that people were \\"lingering\\". Expecting no more than a 10 min wait we told the hostess not the worry and took a walk around the block to kill some time. We finally got a message that our table was  ready at 9:17. That's almost 35 min later for those keeping track. Once we got back to the restaurant we then had a further wait before we were finally shown to a table. The hostess apologized profusely and told us that she would send a long some free snacks in appreciation of our patience. At this point we were slightly frustrated but were trying to remain calm and pleasant in the hopes of not destroying a pleasant evening.\\n\\nOf course even that small amount of patience soon evaporated when we met our waiter. His attitude was completely dismissive. He didn't bother to take our order for a solid 15 min. Once we did put the order in, the food took almost 40 min to come out of the kitchen. When I asked him what the status of the order was he told me it would be there momentarily - zero apologies, zero explanations. To add insult on top of injury once the meal arrived, the pizza that we got was burnt (which according to our waiter was just because of the semolina flour that the restaurant uses), the lobster tail was rubbery, and the blue crab pasta was salty. The thumb in the eye at the end of the meal came when we asked for the pasta to be packed and instead it was \\"accidentally thrown out\\". And by the way we never did get those free snacks that were meant to be an apology for the original wait. \\n\\nAll in all it was a terrible evening. I'm embarrassed that I brought my parents here, and more embarrassed still that we paid $20 a plate for terrible service and mediocre food. It's clear that other diners have fared better than us in the past, but frankly even a small chance of spending an evening like we did tonight would make me steer clear of this place."},{"name":"Mikki V's","address":"156 Tuskawilla Rd, Ste 1344","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3","text":"I got a devin burger last weekend.

What makes it even better is that the servers actually refill the pot with ACTUAL BROTH, so there's no shame in gulping down lots of it. Unfortunately, it's not all you can eat and it's a bit on the pricier side, but the quality of the food is pretty good (better than what I get at AYCE) even though the portions are a little small.

We don't just pick a place and go, then review. We go to Yelp reviews and look for places with at least four-star reviews and a nice number of reviews. That is why all of my reviews have all been four or five stars. We are picking  places that other Yelpers are rating four-five star. Pictures are big with us. If it looks good it likely is good.\\n\\nAdded another pizza joint to our pizza tour with this place. Great atmosphere. There are copper tea pots and kettles all over the walls and cool pictures. Medium sized place with lots of tables and booths but crowded would be the wrong word to use. The trouble with such a place is noise. It was about half full, and you know in a half full place there is going to be a table of people who seem to think everyone wants to hear their conversation. Seems inevitable. Nice parking lot.\\n\\nWe always get the same pizza on the pizza tour, pepperoni, sausage, mushroom. The pizza was piled high with toppings. Every piece had places you could not see the cheese. Good crispy thin crust done perfectly. Plenty of cheese. Delicious pizza. It would seriously threaten our top five if not for one red flag negative. Canned mushrooms. \\n\\nWe also got an antipasta. It was pricey at $12 but it fed two. Mostly meat and several fresh cheeses with red onion. There was enough lettuce to still call it a salad instead of a meat and cheese platter.  What made it special was an Italian dressing that was obviously made in house. They bring out a bowl so you can add as much as you want. It was delicious. \\n\\nDidn't get homemade Italian but canned mushrooms. My review would have been a five-star with the taste of fresh mushrooms and without the rubbery tastelessness of canned.

Immigrating to the United States in 2004 to finish his education, he enrolled at Valencia College with the mindset of furthering his love in the culinary arts.\\n\\nChef Velasco traveled from coast to coast before and after attending Valencia College, studying under Chef Norman Van Aken in Miami as well as here in Orlando. He eventually returned to Winter Park, FL to take his position as Executive Chef of Barnie's CoffeeKitchen.\\n\\nBarnie's CoffeeKitchen is a home grown Florida original coffee company for over 30 years with over 50 hand-selected coffees. At CoffeeKitchen, they treat their coffee as food. The quality of the beans from the beginning on a farm to how roasters and baristas prepare the coffee defines a \\"real cup of coffee\\".\\n\\nFirst \\"on the table\\", there was the Cream of Carrot Shooters with hints of ginger and coriander. This was my all time favorite of the night! It demonstrated each flavor - from carrot to ginger to coriander - in every sip and was great to have in the chilly Orlando weather!\\n\\nNext, I sampled the Mini Fig & Brie Tartine with house cured duck prosciutto (left) and Mini Smoked Salmon Tartine with cr√®me fraiche and lemon oil (right). To those who like a little sweetness, I'd suggest the fig and brie tartine; however,the flavors of duck prosciutto was a bit lost in the fig and brie tartine and I can only assume that the prosciutto itself would have been delicious to have on it's own...\\n\\nThe freshness and savory taste of the smoked salmon made me prefer the smoked salmon tartine over the fig and brie.\\n\\nThe Mini Caprese Tartine with heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella and balsamic glaze was great: every ingredient came together to make this dish pop. It was so delicious that I forgot what type of bread it was on - I wanted to stuff the tartine all in my mouth as soon as I could!\\n\\nKey West Pink Shrimp Skewers (Mojo marinated) were served with an herb aioli. The shrimp was a delight with a sweet finishing taste. Chef Velasco did a great job in cooking the shrimp just right - juicy, not too raw and not too dry.\\n\\nFlank Steak Skewers with salsa verde were very delicious, but weren't my favorite of the night. If I was in the mood for protein, this would be my \\"go to\\" snack.\\n\\nMini Chicken and Lentil Tagine with Mediterranean spices and preserved lemon was delicious when eating it all in one bite - I really loved how the chicken was moist and juicy.\\n\\nHowever, I couldn't taste the lentils in this dish at all. It was more of a moderate flavor in the dish where the Mediterranean spices were leveled with the amount of lemon added to it.\\n\\nThe Brazil Sitio Primavera, a 2013 Cup of Excellence Winner, was made by the pour over method at the CoffeeKitchen. This was a smooth cup of coffee that isn't very strong as the coffee is quickly filtered through when hot water travels through the coffee grounds into a glass vile and given to patrons.\\n\\nThe Greenwell Farms 100% Hawaiian Kona was created and served using the Chemex Method. This little cup of Joe was VERY smooth. If desired for a plain, black coffee...this cup is for you. Not the least bit \\"plain\\", it is sweet and has a tropical twist that was unique to my tastebuds. The best of the best can only give you that nirvana feeling any coffee lover would hope to experience.\\n\\nCoffeeKitchen barista's special: Thai Tea Latte with espresso served iced. Served hot or iced, you'll enjoy a lovely Thai Tea unique from other Thai Teas when you're at Barnie's. At Barnie's, they use their own lemongrass and herbs straight from their gardens that are picked daily to give you that fresh desire after a long day of work!\\n\\nAfter reading this blog, I hope you realized that you can get more out of your visit at Barnie's CoffeeKitchen than just a cup of Joe...you can order food, wine, champagne, etc! Speaking of champagne, there's one with an infused apple \\"juice\\" of sorts.\\n\\nAnother, an infused grapefruit and ginger \\"juice\\". Both \\"juices\\" were in ice form and served with a splash of champagne. Both are quite tasty, but I like the grapefruit and ginger option because I am a citrus lover.

It was between Chez Nous or Barley- I wish I had picked Barley. The place was packed by 6:45, and there were 5 servers waiting on everyone...and I mean everyone. No one had assigned sections and they seemed to all be working as a \\"team.\\" Bad idea. Who does that? All it did was lead to confusion. 1.5 stars for service. More on that later.\\n\\nOverall, I would give the food a 3.5-4. The duck pate was just like any other pate- nothing special. The escargots were disappointing- Shearn's escargots (in Galveston) kicked Chez Nous' ass. My tenderloin was good but again nothing special. If I'm ordering the most expensive thing on the menu, I expect it to be freaking delicious. Hubs' scallops were by far the best thing. The creme brulee was tasty, but honestly, you'd have to try really hard to mess up creme brulee. \\n\\nNow back to service: it was the most awful service I've had in foreverrrr. The staff was friendly enough (some were more professional than others- ahem, guy that smacked my menu with a pen multiple times while making recommendations). However, we ordered our entrees before the table next to us ordered theirs. Since the tables are so damn close, I could hear that they ordered the same steak as me- cooked the same way- and the trout dish. They were almost done eating by the time we got our food! There's no way Hubs' scallops could've taken 15-20 minutes longer than the trout took to cook! No one ever came by to ask if my steak was cooked to my liking. In case you're wondering, it wasn't. I ordered medium rare, and what I got was more of a medium well. OHHH, maybe THAT's what took so long! I didn't bother sending it back because I was starving and figured that it'd take forever for them to remake it. After the table next to us was done with entrees and requested the check, 3 different servers came by to ask if they wanted a dessert menu. \\n\\"Umm no, we're getting dessert elsewhere. Just the check please,\\" they had to repeat and repeat. \\nIn the meantime, what were we waiting for? The damn dessert menu! Jeez, just turn around and you could've seen that I was waiting. My table was only 2 feet away! As much as I glared, no eye contact was ever made. We had to wait another 10 or so minutes before someone came over to us. \\n\\nWhat a shitty early birthday dinner.

Zyka is located in between Scott Blvd and Church Street across from the Patel Bros supermarket and shopping plaza.  If you're entering from Scott Blvd, pull around the restaurant to find a much larger parking lot adjacent to Church Street.  The dining area is like a huge cafeteria, so this restaurant is great for both small and big groups.  Orders are placed at the counter - when your food is ready you will be called to the counter for pickup. \\n\\nOn the Menu: Zyka boasts a wide selection of chicken, mutton, and even beef dishes.  These are broken down in appetizers and main courses.  Appetizers include Tandoori chicken, chicken seekh kabob, beef boti, chicken 65, and chili chicken.  Main courses include butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, nehari (beef shank), chicken biryani, and mutton biryani.  Items are marked if they are gluten free.  There's a smaller set of vegetarian appetizers (aloo tikka, gobi Manchurian) and vegetarian entrees (saag paneer, chana masala, aloo gobi, and vegetable biryani).  Note that naan and rice are not included with the entrees and must be ordered separately.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nChicken 65 ($6.69) - While I have not eaten a bad chicken 65 dish yet in Atlanta, I'd have to say that Zyka's is my favorite.  Fried, juicy, and cut into medium sized chunks, you'll quickly get addicted to the chicken 65 here.  There are two sauces served on the side, but I think the chicken 65 is excellent even without sauce.  I've eaten this here several times and spice level has ranged from mild to medium.\\n\\nButter Chicken ($6.99) - A delicious dish that isn't for those who are on a diet.  Marinated chicken is cut into small, bite sized chunks.  The sauce is creamy - and to top it off you get an added chunk of butter that melts as you work through your meal.  I think there's a good blend of flavors and the dish is very rich.  Again, enjoy only if you're not counting your calories.\\n\\nAachar Gosht ($7.49) - The mutton in this curry is tender and the curry itself is tasty.  There's a ton of oil in this dish though.  You'll be dipping your naan into an oil layer that may be half an inch thick.  While the butter chicken is \\"pleasantly unhealthy\\", I didn't enjoy this dish as much. \\n\\nRice ($2.99) and Naan ($1.59) - There's not much to review for a plate of rice - except that one plate is good enough for two to share.  The naan at Zyka is good.  Texture is a little better at other restaurants, but I still liked it.\\n\\nVerdict:  If you like chicken 65, then you need to try Zyka.  Some of the curry dishes can be very oily.  As a result, you can get reasonably full off of a single dish with a side of naan or rice.  At the same time, I wouldn't order meat dishes here every day.

I tore that food up. I almost ate the bone and the waitress had to stop me (just kidding). I did not find the prices here to be too expensive or unfair for the portions. I thought the portions were generous and prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area. The food is better here than a lot of places I've spent the same or more money at though, so you could even argue that this place is a better value. They have 5-star food at 3-star prices. The waiters are also fantastic and very welcoming. I would eat here again even if I wasn't a hotel guest (if they allow that).

I made the reservation for 8:30, a late dinner, because we wanted to avoid the crowds and in the event the place was packed. I would say, at this point, the restaurant was about 30% full. We sat and waited for over 10 minutes before our waitress came by to greet us. We waited another 10 minutes for just the water and a glass of diet coke. We ordered. She gave my date a quizzical look like if he was ordering - which he did, just not a full meal. Bread was brought to us another 10 or so minutes later (bread was warm and good). It took another 20 minutes before our Crab Towers came out. Later, followed by the Chowder, and we waited again for the main course. in the meanwhile, i watched my date ate his chowder while i sat and waited for my ribeye except it never came. they delivered the scrod to me, that i didn't order. they had to place my ribeye again and more waiting. Sadly, another 30 minutes has now passed. I took a few bites and decided it was time for us to leave. We got our take out order, the check and boxed the dessert to go, because it's now at least 10:15 and i had barely touched my dinner. The only saving grace was the crab tower was phenomenal, and the ribeye was exactly as i ordered, medium rate (although it was more on the rare side, which is fine with me). The cheesecake was a VERY VERY tiny piece topped with strawberry syrup. yes, syrup. they couldn't even put a slice of fresh fruit or something on top? I don't know if would come back here again.

I didn't give 5 stars because of the ticket's price (more than $17 per adult and $13 per kid under 12) and the popcorn combo( 2 medium cokes, 1 medium popcorn and 1 skittles: $25). \\nSo, it was an expensive experience, but definitely I will come back!"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Be Our Guest is a restaurant located in Disney's Magic Kingdom that offers French cuisine during dinner time.  My fianc√© and I made an advance dinning reservation here 6 months out as we knew we wanted to eat dinner here 1 of the  5 days we were going to be staying at Disney during Star wars half weekend.  The only reservation that was available to us was at 9pm but we didn't mind as it was also extra magic hours at Magic Kingdom that day. \\n\\nAfter checking in for our reservation we did have to wait still around 20 minutes for the host to call our names and let us know that our table was ready. Both times we were seated in the main ballroom. I was hoping to be seated in any other room because it is always SO loud in the ballroom and my fianc√© and I can never hear each other speak. I'd much rather be seated in the Rose gallery and I think we will request to be seated there if we come back here again for a more intimate experience. \\n\\nI have eaten at the beast's castle twice now and have ordered the same thing both times.  I am vegan, and the vegan entr√©e option on the menu is the Ratatouille along with the French Onion soup made vegan for the appetizer. My fianc√© orders the same thing. The waiter brought us out some bread and oil and assured us that it was vegan as well. The food is good, French onion soup is on the salty side. Nothing really special but I think people mostly come here for the ambiance. This is also the only place that you an meet the Beast on property and get your photo taken with him. \\n\\nThe downside is of course, Getting in and out of Magic Kingdom. It's too annoying and not worth it if we're just going for food. Also the it being super hard to get a reservation here sets the expectations higher than they should be. The waiter is always super busy and pays little attention. It's not the best table service that Magic Kingdom has to offer as it's hyped up to be.

After reading rave reviews on all the Disney Forums out there, we were so excited to give this restaurant a try. Our reservation was for 8:05pm and we arrived at 7:45 and were seated by 7:55. We had a party of 6 and the restaurant was clearly busy, to no surprise since it's Disney. Our server came over pretty quick and took our order. I was surprised that there weren't more pasta options on the menu and ended up ordering the Chicken Parmigiana. Other guest in our party ordered pizza, salad, and the mushroom pasta. The food took a while to come out but we were patient as we noticed the restaurant was packed and busy. About 30 minutes go by and my dish and the mushroom pasta came out, followed by the salad a few minutes after that. Being that it's rude to eat before the whole table is served, we waited for the two pizzas to come out. Our server never stopped by and proceeded to take orders and serve all the tables around us. Another 20 minutes go by and finally the server comes by after noticing our frustration and says the pizza will be another 15 minutes. No pizza accompaniments brought to table (cheese, red pepper flakes, salt pepper etc), no bread, no water refills, nothing to hold over the table. At this point the two pasta dishes are cold but we started eating because we were all so hungry. The pizza comes out and server is still no where to be found. We called a manager over and he ended up personally getting the pizza condiments and offered to make our meals over but we were so ready to end this dining experience at this point. Then we got dirty looks from our server from across the room while she spoke to another server. Completely underwhelming dining experience. My chicken parmigiana and the mushroom pizza was nothing to rave about. One of the pizzas was a supposed to have sausage toppings and it had to nickel sized sausage on it so definitely not worth the wait on that one. The other pie was better and had more toppings on it. We were so disappointed in the quality of the food and service as Disney is known to excel at both of these. Would not recommend this place as a sit down dining experience.

I went for the first time the other day and it needs work. \\n\\nPro's: front of house and waitstaff are super friendly and helpful. Cocktails are large (see below). \\n\\nCon's: The food. Almost all of it. \\n\\nUnlike other reviewers I thought the bread was good. I also had the garlic bread which was also fine, maybe better than fine. If I must nitpick, please slice through the loaf, for both the regular and garlic bread. I get the idea of \\"tearing\\" off a piece, but it ended up being a wrestling match to cut-and-pry a piece off. No big deal on regular bread but no fun in butter soaked garlic bread. \\n\\nSecond, I had a good cocktail. Arguably too big, but I'll go ahead an concede I may be the only one who might complain about this! I like them small so they stay cold. \\n\\nFinally the food. I had the calamari to begin. While I liked the crunch, the calamari tasted fishy. Really fishy. I have had a lot of calamari in my life and this was a first. I literally could not finish the small portion.  Just horrible. \\n\\nFinally, I had the chicken piccata. Now, I make this dish at home and consider it a litmus test for this type of Italian place. I have to say it was terrible. The chicken was over cooked and dry and the dish was way over sauced. It was basically a stew. Also, the breading on the chicken was way too much. Piccata should be dredged in flour and saut√©d not breaded and fried. It was pretty clear the chicken was cooked ahead of time and then sauced before serving. Doubtless they pull it from the same bin they make the chicken parm from. Finally, instead of getting pounded chicken fillets, they cut the chicken into bite sized chunks. The not only added to the \\"stew effect\\" but also gave me the distinct impression they were running low on chicken and needed to \\"stretch\\" it. The side of linguine was at best unremarkable. There is no scenario where I would order this again. \\n\\nAs a further aside, I was with my kid. He ordered spaghetti with butter. They (politely) informed him they can only do penne. No big deal, but it does seem odd that a pasta place can't sort out more than one type of pasta. They can't do the same linguine that my piccata came with? It is just off, but I suspect it is easier to keep a bucket of penne on simmer to feed kids. Fine I guess, they don't really claim to be a kid friendly place and that is a fair decision. However I think it speaks to the processes they have in the kitchen. And, not for nothing, I have aged out of quirky restaurant policies (hey at least they take credit cards at this location). \\n\\nFinally, the decor is not awesome. They did not have much to work with, but it looks a lot like the old Bertucci's. The wine lockers at the door are ridiculous. Who stores wine ten feet from the pizza oven? But hey, who am I to judge? The bar looks cozy, though. Both Tamara and The Local can organize a good cocktail, so I hope the wine list stands out. \\n\\nI hate to rant and I see plenty of people love the place, so take it for what it is worth. I would be thrilled if this place works out, because Wayland needs fine dining options. Unfortunately, this is not fine dining yet."},{"name":"Anh and Chi","address":"3388 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Went here on a recommendation of some local friends.

If you are adventurous I would order the fried pig ears that has been lightly fried with a tasty crunchy texture. Personally I think the small plates of Taiwanese noodles and Lou Rou Fan is a better deal than the overpriced beef noodle soup especially given the smaller portions. However the quality of the grass fed beef is quite tender and the clear not so rich broth has a spicy taste. Lou Rou Fan was my favorite small dish as it had a good balance of minced pork etc and rice versus the Taiwanese noodles has too much noodles. However the soy nuggets etc and vegetarian option for noodles is nice. \\n\\nService was prompt and polite. Although I liked the decor it wasn't the cleanest restaurant; also they women's restaurant didn't have a flushing toilet. However the food was good and taste didn't disappoint.

So when my husband told me that a new Cajun place had opened up, my taste buds did a happy dance.\\n\\nWe've gone three times - carryout each time - and the food was delicious each and every time. Flavorful, good portion sizes, spicy but not too spicy. The crawfish etouffe appetizer is AMAZING. It's one of those things where, when you run out of pita chips to scoop it up with, you'll use your fork, spoon, fingertip, whatever is handy so that none of the cheesy crawfish goodness goes to waste.\\n\\nIf you're not sure what you want, their Taste of N'Awlins is a good sampling - gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice. The shrimp and grits were also extremely tasty - my first time trying that dish. The cajun pasta is also very tasty - the cream sauce is soooo good.\\n\\nIf there are any complaints to be made, it would be these:\\n\\n1. They need to be more careful how they pack to go orders. A lot of their meals are a little on the weighty side (again, good size portions!) and they use the round aluminum to-go containers with the cardboard lid and when they stack them, the one on the bottom tends to cave in. Switching to styrofoam or putting cardboard inserts between the stacked items might help this.\\n \\n2. I would have liked a little more andouille sausage with my pasta. Considering you pay extra for your protein (chicken, shrimp, or sausage), more than two small pieces would have been nice.\\n\\nOther than that, it's a great place. Good food, friendly staff, and fast service.

Normally lemon custard filled donuts are overly sweet or bracingly tart but this one struck the perfect balance in the spectrum - probably a byproduct of meyer lemon (which is orange flavored with sweeter key limes, but that's digging too deep). A shower of powdered sugar comes out when you take a bite, but that's part of the fun.\\n\\nThe price tag per donut might seem on the hefty side (and it is) but you are getting truly an artisanal donut made with high quality ingredients.

Sanaa had a much more intimate setting and Boma seems like it was designed to feed the masses. It has tiny tables and there isn't much space in between you and the next table. It's very family friendly and you can see that in the buffet options. While some dishes are authentic and interesting most are common place; corn dog nuggets and mac & cheese don't scream African dining to me.\\n\\nI was here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were seated 20 minutes past our reservation and then had to endure some of the worst service! Our server had two jobs: clear the table and refill our glasses. He only succeeded at clearing the table. He took our drink order but never offered us refills or additional drinks at any time during the meal. When it came time to get the bill, he said he would be back with the check but instead assisted two other tables before he came back. When he was bringing us back our credit cards, he stopped to talk to another server for quite a few minutes. Overall getting the check and leaving took 20 minutes. The server never even made mention of the birthday we were there to celebrate.\\n\\nI'm allergic to cinnamon which I found out at Sanaa affects most of my food choices, I was lucky that I was able to find more foods I could eat at Boma. The best part of this meal was Chef Greg who literally walked me through each buffet station and gave me the run down on what I could and could not have. He saw me later going for seconds and made sure I was able to find foods I liked. Then when it came time for dessert he brought me a special dessert (mango cheesecake) because two options I couldn't have! He was amazing!!!\\n\\nI honestly wasn't impressed with the food choices because most were very generic I'm assuming to accommodate picky eaters. Lots of soups and salads, plain veggies, fresh fruit, cookies, brownies and cupcakes. I could have eaten that anywhere. So aside from those options, I loved the beef sirloin, sweet potatoes, creamed corn and spinach and the zebra domes! The guava dessert was good but needed more sugar. The zebra cakes were to die for!!\\n\\nDespite some pretty good food and awesome attention from the chef I think I will stick with going to Sanaa even if I can only eat 5% of their menu."},{"name":"Citizen Eatery","address":"5011 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Get the yucca fries!

We'd read that the food here was pretty good. I'm a sucker for carbs, therefore I love anything pasta/pizza. We arrive around noon to see if we could be seated. At check-in, the hostess asked if we had any kind of food allergy. We told her we didn't. She asked if we were celebrating anything then saw the \\"Happy Birthday\\" pin on my boyfriends camera strap. She asked if we would want to celebrate it here. We said \\"sure, why not.\\" She made the appropriate notes on the card that the server gets. We waited about five minutes & then were sat. \\n\\nThe restaurant is located in the back of the Italy pavilion. The restaurant is huge. Not only the amount of tables but the size of the ceilings, huge vaulted ceilings. They've got three, large stone ovens for the pizzas. The interior looks nice. Since we were a party of two, we were sat at a 2 top, the kind that share a booth with a bunch of other tables. The tables are kind of close to each other & the guy next to us kept looking over whenever we tried to have a conversation. It was annoying. I'd wished we'd had a table on our own. \\n\\nThey've got servers & also people who run food/drinks. The girl who did the drinks ran up, almost frantic, asking what we'd like to drink. She came back quickly with the drinks. We saw her two other times for drink refills. I skimmed over the menu & realized this place is trying to be somewhat of a nice, sit down restaurant. The issue I have is that things are ran like a fast food place. More on that later. \\n\\nOur server was a young man from Italy. He asked if we'd had time to look at the menu. I wanted to do a custom pizza, but at $17 bucks PLUS $3.50 for each topping. I know we are at Di$ney, but damn. I picked the funghi pizza (individual for $21). Phillip ordered the paccheri alla crema con pollo ($24). After ordering, the server said that the pizza was cooked in a different kitchen than the pasta & they might come out at different times. This makes me think they're trying to get you in & out as fast as possible. Other restaurants have no issue keeping food together to then be brought out together. \\n\\nWith such a large building & crowd comes the noise. It's hard to have any kind of conversation without having a raised voice. Everyone seems to be shouting. I think they could use some of those fabric squares on the ceiling to help with the echoing of noise. \\n\\nAs the server stated, the pasta came out first. We've both been raised that you wait till everyone has their food, so Phillip waited. He waited about ten minutes until I told him to eat. The noisy couple that sat next to us ordered their food about ten minutes after us & they both received their pizzas. The server stopped back by to check on us & told me he was going to check on the pizza. About 20 minutes after Phillip got his pasta, I got my pizza. \\n\\nThe food - I didn't dislike it at all. Was it worth the price? No way. The pizza is your average stone oven pizza. They didn't even spread out the mushrooms when they threw them on. I'd say in a good pizza/Italian place, that pizza would be 13-15 bucks, tops. The pasta wasn't worth $24. It barely had any chicken in it. The prices here are what you'd expect at a nice, sit down restaurant, but the feeling is more fast food. \\n\\nThe server came by to collect the plates & asked if we'd like any dessert or if we were ready for the check. We told him we were ready for the check. I guess the notes made on the ticket didn't make it to him as the birthday celebration didn't happen. We had an okay lunch but not a great experience at all.

As for the menu, there are slight differences such as fewer meat options and cheaper price, but its overall very similar. \\n\\nAlthough its not AYCE, the amount of meat you get is good for its price. Also, the meats and veggies are much more fresh than other hot pot places around here. I come here almost weekly, and haven't regretted it. I'd say its the best hot pot in the entire Boston area (better than Quincy!!). The wait time can be much (~1 hour), but now that they've added the online wait-list, its much more tolerable and easier to plan into your day. \\n\\nSo overall, compared to hot pot places in California, this place deserves 3 stars. Compared to hot pot places in Boston, this is place deserves 5 stars. Hence, I went down the middle with a 4.\\n\\nMUST READ: YOUR SEAT IS A CUBBY.

I'm not saying the food was bad, but for the extra credit, I did not find the experience or the food to be any more impressive (in fact, much less so) than every other place I ate throughout my trip. The 45 minute wait, despite having made reservations 90 days in advance, was less than worth it, and incredibly frustrating. The inability to order stuff for a picky toddler, since even kids have a prix fixe meal, is absolutely ridiculous, because rather than spending $35 on food my toddler wouldn't eat, I instead got to share my minuscule meal with her and leave hungry. The french onion soup was good, but nothing spectacular, and pretty akin to your local diner, just served in a smaller, fancier bowl. The steak was decent, but the sauce on the steak, as well as the caramelized onions, really stole the show. Dessert was fun to look at, but I would much rather have had options to choose from than to have a few colorful pieces of pretty cardboard laid in front of me for my daughter to steal and then spit out. Fun  fact: you can eat the paper, which is one of the better parts of the meal.

Whether or not the food quality deserves 4 or 5 stars can be debated, however, when I consider value I don't see myself returning here. Here's the thing: tapas really just doesn't work here. but, I shall get into that a little bit later. \\n\\nI had ordered two entrees (\\"plates\\" as they call them) the Smoked Bluefish, and the Wood Roasted Char Belly. My parents meanwhile had ordered a Whole Roasted Branzino which I had the opportunity to sample.  Food came out hot and fresh 20 minutes after we had placed our order.  I have nothing against a slightly longer wait time if food is being made fresh for you, though something to munch on in the interim.\\n\\nI am not an expert in fish, but I do like to think that I know good food from not so good food. \\n\\nThe Smoked Bluefish was awesome. The fish was cooked very nicely, the skin had a delightful Char on it. The puree it was served with including the greenish Oriole around it was lovely,  adding a nice smooth, and gently starchy texture. The greens added a nice touch of freshness and weren't by any means overdressed.\\n\\nThe Wood-Roasted Char Belly was amazing as well.  I'm a fan of belly of all sorts, be it pork or fish. What I especially loved about this one was the variation in textures right below the skin. Similar to the bluefish it was cooked quite nicely.  The puree was a little bit different this time, little bit salts your butt for this dish it worked. The greens did their part in adding the freshness, but I would have liked the little bit more creativity. Word to the wise, chew it well. Otherwise, you may have the uncomfortable experience of it trying to go down both pipes at the same time. And talk about that egg yolk and caviar... I have Slavic ancestry so I have no fear of caviar, but for this one... even if you've never had any, go for it! I promise you'll love it. The spoon is there for a reason... what is that Nike slogan?\\n\\nA little piece I had of the Branzino showed that it was cooked well, however, since I didn't get the skin as much I can't speak to the flavor there.  However what I can note is that the puree with this dish was quite salty, considering the size of fish there was not enough of it. In terms of veggies: other than a couple rings of onion, the squash was barely cooked, if at all.\\n\\nNow regarding the value/my issues with tapas here\\n\\nPlease understand, that I have nothing against tapas. However, It is one thing to order a plate of tacos and share them with a friend or two. It is an entirely different matter to get a single piece of fish not much larger than a credit card (by surface area). Furthermore, if you were to try cutting these things in half, because of the skin you'll end up with a mess. If you're eating it yourself that's fine, but if you're trying to share it... heh heh heh good luck. \\n\\nCase in point: the Wood Roasted Char Belly comes with that egg yolk/caviar combo on a spoon. If you're sharing this dish, and you and your friend(s) both want to try it I suggest the \\"eeny-meeny-miny-moe\\" method as opposed to trying to cut the egg yolk in half. It's designed to be put in your mouth whole. and you only get the one. \\n\\nNow, if this dish cost $5 or maybe even $7 it wouldn't be that bad. Considering how much you get and how much you're paying for it the value just isn't there. I had two \\"plates\\"  and left still hungry  After shelling out (no pun intended) $33. \\n\\nThe service was very polite, very professional, and most importantly extremely knowledgeable about the menu.

The aviator was slightly stout but refreshing; I'd order another.\\n\\nAs for the food, the selection is quite large spanning from African piri piri cauliflower to middle eastern inspired lamb to a good ole fashioned burger. Generally, I am a bit wary of a place that offers such a wide genre of food, but everything we had hit the mark. The Cuban egg rolls erred on the drier side, but the Char Siu BBQ was a definite win.

Everyone that worked there looked miserable like they not only hated their jobs but their lives, only one person was pleasant and that was the girl in the to go section, the hostess was sloppy and rude to every customer she spoke with, her attitude was gross. Once we got to the to go section, the lady checked us out real easy and brought out our food but we had to wait for the shake because they wait for the customer to get there to make it which we thought we'd appreciate because it'd be fresh but after waiting for 15 minutes we walked over to the bar asking for the shake and he said they were out of strawberry ... why wouldn't you inform someone instead of going on like you didn't know a customer was obviously waiting ... okay cool whatever we got a different one and left. The food was absolutely disgraceful and unpleasant. I was so disappointed. The steak was over cooked and the artichoke dip tasted like fish. The restaurant it's self was dirty, trash all over the floor and tables, no one cared to clean anything so I can only imagine how the kitchen was.

The tea tastes fresh brewed. I had jasmine milk tea and the peach oolong milk tea. The jasmine one had an incredible floral taste to it compared to other places where it's just a hint of it.

As a point of reference, Clyde Common is sort of a cross between Agricole and the Breslin Bar in New York City (which, incidentally, is next to NYC's Ace Hotel as CC is to Portland's Ace). However, CC's high-mixo craft cocktails are as good as or better than either of those places, the same applies to the creative fare, and--at least in our experience--the friendliness factor is very Portland. Which is to say, it's perceptibly ahead of New York and blows San Francisco clean out of the water.\\n\\nThe GF and I were visiting her mom for the holidays, and whenever we're on a family or business trip, our decompression ritual is to try to find the best cocktails in town and perhaps a few creative small plates to soak up the booze. We normally sit at the bar, as we did here. \\n\\nFirst round: She got an egg nog made with tequila and Amontillado sherry, which may have been the best egg nog I've ever tasted. I ordered a Robert Louis Stevenson, a whiskey drink made with scotch, Imbue vermouth, Benedictine, apricot brandy, and bitters. Brown liquor drinks with bitter, citrus, sweet, and smokey notes are sort of my favorite right now, and this was up there with the best such cocktails I've tried in the you-have-to-know-someone-to-get-in speakeasies of NYC's lower east side. Perfectly balanced and delicious.\\n\\nSecond round: She got a \\"bartender's choice\\" tequila drink, served over ice in a Collins glass. I didn't pay attention to everything our bartender Junior (more on him in a bit) put in it, but I tasted it and it too was delicious. I got a barrel-aged \\"Remember the Maine.\\" Pretty simple ingredient list: rye, vermouth, housemade cherry brandy, and absinthe, but get this: They make a few gallons of the recipe at a time, then age it in a sherry-washed whiskey barrel for two months. They do the same with a negroni. The results are transcendent: a rich, complex cocktail with deep levels of flavor that unfold with every sip. We haven't been to a bar that does this before, or if we were in one, we didn't know it. \\n\\nFood: Though we didn't have any entrees, we'd certainly return to try them on the strength of the snacks and starters we tried. Chicken fried chicken livers with a spicy remoulade for dipping were perfectly crispy outside, almost like foie gras inside, and had none of the gamey taste that makes some people detest liver of any kind. Our veggie side was a plate of roast brussels sprouts and baby turnips, IIRC in a simple garlic, olive oil, and sea salt presentation. Delicious, perfectly cooked, not too oily. I kept cheating and dipping the brussels sprouts in the sauce that came with the livers. \\n\\nKudos to the $5 \\"Snacks\\" section of the bar menu. They're decently sized and a great way to find out what flavors you like without spending too much. Try getting anything in San Francisco for $5 other than (maybe) an hour of parking. Entrees were largely in the mid-$20's, which again seems like an excellent value to our Bay-battered wallets. \\n\\nThe review wouldn't be complete without giving props to Junior, who was obviously passionate about mixology and talked a lot with us about his favorite liquors, ingredients, and techniques. Super friendly and attentive--on par with our favorite hometown barman, Alex of Marzano on Park in Oakland. (If you know the place, that's saying something.)\\n\\nSo though we can't yet speak to the entrees or the service in the restaurant section, we had a five-star experience doing what we do: Sitting at the bar, talking to the bartender, and enjoying the cocktails and food way too much to pay any attention to whether the place was \\"too hipster.\\" Whatever hipsters are, I'm pretty sure we're not among their ranks, and we were treated very well. \\n\\nWe'll definitely be back."},{"name":"Bread & Co","address":"1230 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is pretty good.

Apparently there was a live band about to perform so there were patrons who are fans, and came to watch the live band. We were told that we had a short wait unless we wanted to sit outside, but all the tables were taken outside as well, but what was funny to me was, there was two tables being cleaned and we were next up, and the hostess told us that the table was for big parties only. Well I was with my family of three and typical booths go up to four people but can still sit two people and a baby. But the hostess wouldn't allow us to sit there, so we sat outside on the patio, which was nice, but not my preference in most cases. We asked for a high chair, and after a few minutes of waiting, the hostess never came back with the high chair, so I went in and grabbed it myself.\\n\\nThe evening got better when our server Dustin showed up.

Then when i showed her the chicken taquitos and enchilada side by side then she agreed that they are the same. The side of mexican rice that came with enchilada tasted like dirt and was really dry in my opinion tacobell has better tasting and quality of mexican rice.\\n\\nI know servers in the restaurants work really hard every single shift, but this server was like i dont give a f**k what customer wants.

Although the staff isn't completely Vietnamese, they do put a lot of effort into memorizing the menu in Vietnamese which gives it an authentic feel.\\n\\nThe menu has great choices that showcases the highlights of Vietnamese cuisine but some are not commonly found at other restaurants. My table ordered the mango salad, pork spring rolls, bun bo hue, the DIY platter, lemon grass chicken on vermicelli, and I myself got the bun cha.  The mango salad was the highlight of the meal for me. The mango is more on the sour side and firm, but still sweet. They dress the salad with a vinegar which compliments the sweetness of the mango. The spring roll is done well, although I prefer a thinner wrap. For my bun cha, it was really good and came with a lot of different types of meats. The broth tasted like fish sauce but not as strong. Also there wasn't a lot of broth in the bowl. It comes with lots of veggies for you to wrap the some portions like a salad wrap. Sadly, I found a dead fly in one of the lettuce leaves which made me paranoid of all the vegetables. Another complaint my table had was that the broths for their food was lacking flavour. We might be a bit too critical because we're Vietnamese and the restaurant caters for all the diverse people in Vancouver. The food is also very pricey. $8 for 1 spring roll cut into 5 or 6 pieces and each entree was $18 to $25.\\n\\nOverall, I would go here again, but not on my own decision.

I've always been impressed by the huge space, the upscale finishes, the faux steam fireplace, the billiard table, the hidden room, the plush seating areas (upholstered seats, deep leader sofas), the enormous outdoor patio with lovely seating areas and awesome heaters (!), and best of all, it's all right beside the Rogers' stadium rim, you can practically reach out and touch it! And when it lights up and the colors turn on, it's magical. (You can even hear the cheers of the patrons in the stadium!). \\n\\nTwo days ago, I brought my kid here to check out the lounge, to see if she wanted to return on Saturday night (tonight). (Note: she's visiting from Oregon for a few weeks). Like me, she was impressed with the space and how nice the staff was. I asked if there'd be any musicians and/or a DJ here on Saturday and the woman called over a male employee (the manager? I'm not sure) who said yes, there'd be a jazz band here on Saturday at 7pm and, afterwards around 9pm, there'd be a DJ. We were excited, and we planned on coming by at 7 for the jazz band.\\n\\nFlash forward to tonight at 7pm: we arrive and are told no, there's no jazz band tonight. Only on SOME Saturdays are there musicians - but not tonight. Argh. (This is the reason I'm not giving 5 stars, for the false information we were given). Most of the tables and seating areas were reserved but we got a table in front of the DJ booth.

Those singles and on dates can luck out and get instant seating at the bar, which is what happened to me.\\n\\nSitting at the bar, the bartender informed me most of the meals were family-sized, designed to be shared by a family. But if I was hungry, he pointed out to a few options to try out. I ended up ordering the Enter the Dragon, the crispy rolls, and the crepe.\\n\\n-Enter the Dragon: I'm all about mezcal cocktails and do appreciate Bruce Lee films. Including averna amaro, rose ginger, honey, lemon, and candied ginger as a garnish. Sweet, smokey, slightly spicy - exactly what I want in a mezcal cocktail. I got two.\\n\\n-Ch Gi√≤: I will order crispy rolls or dumplings in any restaurant I go to. Delivered in a basket alongside lettuce leaves, shiso leaves, mint leaves, and fish sauce. These were so good! I devoured the entire order of pork-filled rolls. \\n\\n-B√°nh X√®o: When you see a section called \\"bucket list\\" I feel you need to order from it. I've had Vietnamese crepes from restaurants before but this was really delicious. A huge rice flour, coconut milk, and turmeric crepe filled to overflowing with bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp, and likewise served with lettuce, leaves, and fish sauce. The blending of fresh leaves and fried crepe make for a delicious meal. I devoured the entire crepe.\\n\\nAn amazing experience even if I was eating alone, the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout, and sitting next to the kitchen window gave me great views into how the food is made which added to the experience. I highly recommend Anh and Chi and would gladly take friends back here."},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We've passed by Locus on many occasions travelling down Main Street looking for a bit to eat.

They completely forgot the prime rib on the burger, and instead of remaking the burger, 10 minutes later, they bring out the additives to the sandwich.

While there have been some frustrations there in the past - half the time, sandwiches aren't prepared as requested but that is forgivable- I've never had an issue coming in late to pick up food. I work late sometimes and don't make it to the restaurant until right before closing - when I do come in late, employees are generally welcoming and assure me that they are open until 10:00PM. Whoever was working tonight didn't get that memo. When I got to the door at 9:49, I saw all of the chairs up on the tables, the rugs folded up, and an employee sweeping the floors. When I opened the door she said they were closed. Neither she nor anyone else there were in any hurry, so there clearly wasn't an emergent reason for the mm to be closed early. I've worked in similar restaurants before and I am aware of the time it takes to flip chairs and clean floors, so I would estimate that these employees had closed the restaurant at least five minutes before I arrived if not more. It is completely unacceptable and unprofessional to close before the designated time - that's how you lose money and business. I am a loyal customer to Firehouse Subs. I have been eating these sandwiches as long as I have been able to and have always loved it. But tonight upset me.

Although the sliders were cooked through a little more than my preference, they were very juicy and delicious. The margarita pizza was super cheesy, but the crust was crisp and delicious. I had a quick taste of the arancini and the sachetti and they both tasted really nice! For our entrees I had the swordfish, my boyfriend and friend both had the shortribs and her boyfriend had shrimp al limone. He said the pasta tasted wonderfully fresh and the short ribs fell off the bone beautifully, so no complaints there. My boyfriend was a little sad there weren't more, but then he got to finish my friend's, so all was well with the world. My swordfish was really nice, perhaps a little on the dry side but I didn't bother me as there was a beautiful tomato sauce on top of it. \\nFor dessert we ordered the fociocolata and the bread pudding and they were both a great end to a wonderful dinner. The cinnamon goes really well with the whipped cream on top of the fociocolata and the bread pudding was huge. If we had known how big it was, I'm sure we wouldn't have ordered the fociocolata. \\nThe patio was packed and we were served a three course meal with drinks in about 2.5 hours, so props to Fabio for taking really good care of us!

I'm sorry, mom...but Java Noodles is a sorry excuse for Indonesian food.\\n\\nWe ordered the basic Indonesian food. You know, the ones that white people order because it's similar to Chinese or Thai...fried rice, chicken satay, beef curry, etc. The rice was bland. The chicken satay was bad. It tasted like it wasn't completely cooked, couldn't even finish a skewer. Their peanut sauce wasnt bad, but I'm pretty sure it was made with peanut butter. Kind of like the ones I tried to make (without the proper ingredients) when I first moved to the states...I was 10 yrs old. Their shrimp chips was awesome, but then again we can buy a bag of those in the Asian market and fry them ourselves ;)\\n\\nPerhaps I should've known better. There was a bunch of white people in the restaurant...working there. No offense to white people, I married one. And my daughter confirmed, at an Indonesian restaurant in LA to the Indonesian waitress, that she is in fact American...she was 4 at the time. Indonesian food isnt exactly mainstream, and every Indonesian restaurant I've been to, NY, Philly, DC, LA, all had Indonesians working there. Our friendly (and the only Asian) waiter explained to us that the owners are Chinese Indonesians or something like that. Yeah, he wasn't exactly sure. But what the heck does that have to do with anything? Every Indonesian restaurant I've been to is owned by Chinese Indonesians. I'm Chinese Indonesian, and so are my mom and my aunts, but we wouldn't cook or pass what Java Noodles served us as Indonesian. Scratch that, my mom and aunts would never pass it off as Indonesian food. I prefer to eat Indonesian food, not make it. Although, I may need to start.\\n\\nAnywho, 2 stars...only because our waiter was friendly and they comped our chicken satay. We left a bunch of uneaten food on the table, which rarely happens. I always order days of food to take home when at an Indonesian restaurant. \\n\\nJava noodles has an identity crisis.  Asian fusion, more like Asian \\"I'm not sure what I'm doing\\" fusion.

We will not return to this location. We went through the drive through which had no cars in line to order and only 2 cars in line to pay for food. We were told to wait to order, and it took at least 5 minutes for someone to take our order. My fianc√© wanted a number 11 (popcorn shrimp and chicken tender combo) and I wanted a chicken tender kids meal. Simple, right? No. We started by ordering the 11 and then the kids meal but the total reflected the number 11 only. We pulled forward, assuming we could get it situated at the window. With one car in front of us, we waited at least 10 minutes to get to the window to pay for our food. They had horrible customer service. We asked the employee about the price but he didn't have an answer so the manager came. We were able to get them to understand what we wanted. We waited an additional 10 minutes to get the food. We got the food and I immediately ate a fry and it was cold, and I could tell the order was wrong but we were so fed up with the wait, the service and the lack of competence that we just took it and left. Turns out, we paid for, but didn't receive the kids meal chicken tender or my fianc√©'s Cajun rice side. My fianc√© did not like the popcorn shrimp either.

The tables are very close together that you can hear other people's conversations. They also have a see through window where you can see the noodles being handmade. When we first sat down they gave us a glass container with water which is really handy because then you don't have to wait for your water cup to be refilled when you can do it yourself and they also gave us kimchi. We ordered the 10 piece dumplings for 8 dollars and they tasted pretty average like something you would buy from the store and heat up in the microwave. I ordered the sesame shrimp which was served on top of brown fried noodles with a side of white rice for 15 dollars. I got a lot of shrimp for my money but it's about quality not quantity in my opinion. It seemed as though they rushed my dish because some of my shrimp was covered in more seasoning than the other pieces. My boyfriend got the handmade noodles which came with cabbage,peppers, onions, and celery for 10 dollars. He didn't get his dish until about 30 minutes after mine came out because our waitress didn't grab it in time after it was made which resulted in another waiter taking it and then our waitress forgetting about us.

Luke T. suggested this place (specifically the portabello burger and the mac 'n' cheese).\\n\\nIt was pretty quiet on a Tuesday around seven, probably in part because a Blue Jackets game was scheduled for seven.  It was a little confusing at first figuring out the seating situation, but after a second we noticed the host stand sign over the mostly hidden stand.  We were easily seated in a booth, which had little jacket hooks that surprisingly did not let our coats fall to the floor during the meal.  Our waitress informed us that burgers are $6 on Tuesdays (with the exception of one or two specialties), which is a savings of $4 or 5.  I had wanted to try the truffle mac 'n' cheese that Luke had so highly recommended, but it was only offered in a full-size entree (no half or side orders), and I regretfully decided against attempting that much lactose and pasta.  I ended up getting the Caprese Breezy burger with the kettle chips as a side.  For six dollars, I thought the burger was pretty good -- it featured shredded basil, tomato, and mozzarella, and was pretty hefty.  The bun stood up for the entire burger and was sturdy enough that I didn't have to resort to knife/fork.  The kettle chips were acceptable, though I realized that I really don't like them in general as much as I think I do when I order or buy them.  \\n\\nThe hostess was a little brisk in seating us, but our waitress was nice, checking up on us a couple of times and splitting our check with no fuss.

I saw recently on Social Media that my friend visited Brick & Fire, and was VERY pleased to find out they moved Downtown. They are one of the only pizza parlors that I have seen that makes a Shrimp Scampi pizza. I had it once before, and was so excited to know they have moved and it's still on the menu!\\n  Friday night after going to the Tree Lighting at Lake Eola, my friend and I decided to go over there and grab a late bite. They were open until 10, and still obliged us at 9:20p.m. We were borderline hangry by the time we got to the restaurant, so an app was definitely on our mind! I saw the Bruschetta Bites, and being that I LOVE Goat Cheese, I decided to try that one out. It also had on it: Red Peppers, Balsamic Roasted Onions, and Basil. It comes with Artichoke, but I left it off. It also comes with a drizzle of their balsamic and basil on the plate perfect for dipping. The Balsamic was usually sweet and so delicious! Let me just tell you, this dish was SUPERB! Not just because we were starving either. This was by far one of the BEST Bruschettas I've ever had. FYI, the order only comes with one for $3.00. It was so tasty, we ordered a second one right away. Of course for our main entree, we had to order the Shrimp Scampi pizza. It was as delectable as I remembered- if not more! The crust on their brick fired pizza was delightful. I don't know about you, but I don't often eat the crust on pizza. Some times its too hard, and other times too doughy. This crust reigned supreme! It was also wonderful that they don't skimp on the shrimp. Almost 3 shrimp to each piece of the pie. It was Shrimp Pizza Perfection! \\n  Our service was also top notch. Our waitress was super attentive- which we both appreciated very much. We noticed a table next to us ordered pasta that also looked pleasing, so next time that might be on the agenda. It seems odd to give a restaurant 5 stars just off two dishes, but they were both show stoppers. I'm sure that they carry on this quality in all of their food.

I love Italian food and I've been to Epcot 9,000 times, yet somehow I had never eaten here before.  That makes sense.  Via Napoli is located in the very back of the Italy Pavilion.  As you're walking past the lavish courtyard and statue it's hard not to get caught up in the moment.  The exterior of this restaurant is beautiful. The interior is nice also.  My favorite touch was the stone faces added to the wood fired pizza ovens.  It made it look like the chefs were feeding the statues!\\n\\nThe menu had a wide variety of choices but I was really in the mood for pizza.  The best compliment I can give the pizza is that it did not taste at all like pizza you would expect from a theme park.  In fact, it tasted exactly like pizza from Grimaldi's, which I also tried for the first time recently.  The dough was nice and chewy and the pizza was really delicious.  The price is obviously more than you would pay at a regular restaurant, but when you consider how many people can eat from a large pizza it actually comes out to be a good deal per person compared to other Epcot sit-down restaurants.\\n\\nThe dessert menu had large pictures of every item except for one, the apple cake, which is what we ended up getting.  I had never had apple cake before and it was fantastic.  It came with a small scoop of gelato on the side.\\n\\nI was really envious of people that were sitting at regular tables.  We were seated in an area where many tables had been pushed up against a long bench.  I was sitting so close to the people next to us I could have eaten off of their plate.  I also thought that it was strange that the small, curved appetizer plates that were already on the table are what they expected us to eat our huge pizza slices off of.

I have to tell you that I was frustrated before even setting foot in the place.  This is because Google Maps steered me completely wrong, and I ended up three miles north of Lion and Rose in some residential neighborhood.  Thanks, Google Maps!  How very helpful of you!  I finally found the correct location on Google Maps as I was parked in the incorrect neighborhood, but as I set out again, my car beeped to tell me I was low on gas.  I looked down and saw the gas needle was below the red danger line.  Below E.  Since this restaurant and I were on 360, I figured I would run completely out of gas and have to call a tow truck, being that there just aren't really any gas stations on 360.  Luckily, I was only a couple of miles away from Bee Caves Rd (and that's where the restaurant is, by the way), and I thankfully found a gas station right there at the intersection.  No turn in for the gas station, of course, so I had to go up and make a u-turn.  Oh-so convenient.\\n\\nSo I finally found the place and was only a few minutes late for my group brunch.  The waitress came over right away and got me some coffee, which I desperately needed.  The coffee didn't taste that great.  I then ordered the Eggs Newcastle, which is Eggs Benedict with crab cakes instead of Canadian bacon/ham.  It started out good, but then I found green peppers in the crab cakes.  I admit I've never been to Britain, but putting green peppers in crab cakes doesn't sound very British to me.  Is that a normal crab cake ingredient?  I was very disappointed with that.  After removing all traces of green pepper, I finally ate my meal.  It was pretty good for what it was, but I think I simply don't like crab cakes as well as I thought I did.  I can't fault Lion and Rose for that.  The poached eggs were awesome, actually.  The breakfast potatoes (home potatoes) that came with it were not very good.  They were the first things on the plate that I tried, and they were cold already.  The strawberries that came with it were very good, so at least there was that.  The gal sitting next to me got the Fish & Chips with mac and cheese (made with a Guinness cheese sauce), and that looked excellent.\\n\\nIt took a while to get my check.  I don't completely blame Lion and Rose for that since we had two tables of about ten people each, but it seemed the waitress ignored my table for a good 15 minutes while she tended to the other table.  \\n\\nThe only reason I wanted my check at that early point was because the socially inept moron sitting on my other side was annoying the hell out of me.  I'd met him the other night at J Black's and mentioned that I'd taken the bus there, so today he asked me no less than three times if I took the bus to Lion and Rose.  I answered no twice and finally got so annoyed that I didn't answer him the third time and tried to involve myself in some other conversation.  The guy didn't seem to notice that I had stopped paying attention to him, as he started asking me when I'm buying a new house.  Um, what?  I didn't remember mentioning anything about buying a new house at any point, seeing as how I'm not in the market for a house right now.  Another table mate then asked if he was in real estate, to which he obviously replied yes, so then he started trying to sell her his services.  Oh okay, so you come to a strictly social brunch and start plugging your real estate business to people who couldn't care less?  Not cool.  He later talked in length and detail to anyone within ear shot about the food poisoning he'd had a couple of weeks ago.    Where is the waitress with my bill?!  Okay, okay, I'm getting way off topic.\\n\\nThe waitresses seemed nice enough, and the food was decent.  I do want to go back and try the Fish & Chips with mac and cheese.  It really did look and smell wonderful.  The English Chips with Guinness Cheese and Bacon Dip sounds good, too.  I came close to ordering Scotch Eggs.  I've heard those are good.  Lion and Rose has a lot to choose from on their lunch/dinner menu, but the brunch menu is not nearly as impressive.\\n\\nAnd like I alluded to earlier, don't trust the Google Maps location you see here.  Google Maps on this page puts the place in the Wild Basin Wilderness Park.  When I put the address into Google Maps myself, it put Lion and Rose further north in a residential neighborhood off of Waymaker Way.  Lion and Rose is located in the Village at West Lake, which is in the SE quadrant of 360 and Bee Caves Rd (2244).  Turn right at the first light once you get into that quadrant."},{"name":"Meza","address":"1780 Jake St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Just go there. Try everything. Put it in your mouth.

A mango, sapodilla, pistachio, and maybe an almond or something. All came delivered in traditional reusable clay pots. All were devoured.

You won't necessarily have a choice of which room - the grand ballroom, the west wing, or the castle gallery - as each room will likely be filled to capacity with the constant stream of guests. (Advance reservations are absolutely required.) But, the grand ballroom and the west wing are undoubtedly the highlights; while the former features massive \\"windows\\" that have digital screens portray wintry scenes, the latter features a projection of the enchanted rose and a magical portrait of Beast that transforms whenever the lightning strikes.  Even if you aren't seated in these areas, you are welcome to wander around the different rooms and marvel at the sights.  \\n\\nIn most cases, you'll likely be dining at Be Our Guest for the ambiance rather than the food.  Put simply, the food is not as spectacular as your surroundings.  For instance, my French dip sandwich ($17.49) was passable, but it was a steal compared to the fixed breakfast and dinner prices.  (Note that dinner reservations are also incredibly difficult to come by.)  You'll definitely want to try the Master's Cupcake ($4.99), which features the infamous grey stuff.  But, if you have access to Disneyland in Anaheim, then you'll be able to get what I think is a better version of the dessert at the Red Rose Tavern without having to hustle for a reservation.  The lemon meringue cupcake ($4.99) was fine, but you can easily find better elsewhere."},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"110-532 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I love peaceful, and this is the by far the best location, but I still find it hit or miss.

In fact, we almost always eat here more than once during each stay. \\nIn December 2018 we had Via Napoli three times in one week. Why do we make this a priority in a park that is FULL of food? \\n\\n*The Pizza \\nMy husband is probably pizza's biggest fan. He's eaten pizza everywhere, on all of our travels, and Via Napoli is the pizza that stole his heart. Their crust has a very faint salt-water-ish flavor that we see in a lot of Neapolitan and NYC pizzas. The sauce and cheese are perfect. You can definitely taste the higher standard to which they hold their ingredients. \\n\\n*The Pasta \\nTheir ravioli is as good as homemade. It tastes like my memories of Autumn afternoons filling ravioli with family. The pasta is thin enough not to overpower the filling and it is cooked with just enough bite remaining. \\n\\nEverything else: \\nThere is nothing bad on the menu. \\n\\nCast: \\nThe staff at Via Napoli are always very friendly and take time to ask about our day and even our lives. They are extremely attentive as well. On a recent visit we ate lunch here in the middle of a record breaking heat wave. Our server Mattia and his assistant Alec made sure our water glasses were never missing more than a few sips. Together our party of 4 probably drank 20 glasses of water and never once had to wait for a refill. The restaurant managers have also been very courteous, checking in on us and showing genuine concern guest satisfaction. \\n\\nOther stuff:\\nThe prices are pretty average for table service dining. \\nAround $26 for many of the pasta dishes and an affordable $31 for the 20\\" pizza that can easily feed 2 adults and 2 children, or even 4 adults.

Marissa didn't ask us if we wanted water (others seated around us were brought water without asking for it) and was about half walking away while grabbing our menus.

She also literally dropped the bill on our table while walking by, let alone asking if we wanted dessert.

The broth was on the thicker side and slightly glutinous, but not too salty or oily like many other ramen places.

The broth is one of the best I have ever had in Boston!\\n\\nThe cha-shu was perfectly cooked and soft and just melts in your mouth, and was torched to add the extra smoky, bbq-y flavor.

Yeah, we couldn't stay away from the tasty \\"tapas-style\\" Taiwanese menu for long. This is bound to be one of our go-tos and quite possible in-town favorites for sure. Here's what we've had:\\n\\nVeggie fried rice -- Textbook. Exactly what you would expect and it's a whopper of a portion, too. \\n\\nHot & Sour soup -- The best I've had to date. The chef mentioned he had been working on a good balance and I'm pretty sure he's nailed it. I wouldn't change a thing... except maybe have this on tap at my house. Love it. \\n\\nPickled veggies -- Carrots and daikon with plenty of delicious pickle-y, ferment-y flavors. Definitely worth a try. \\n\\nThai Cucumbers -- Fantastic and refreshing.\\n\\nVeggie Bao -- Steam bun, tofu, veg, wonderful sauces, perfect balance of textures. Each of these suckers is $4.50 and well worth the pricetag. It's the kind of thing you could easily eat 3-4 of. \\n\\nMatcha mochi -- Served piping hot, made to order, and absolutely fantastic. \\n\\nThe owner/manager has been there for both of our visits and he is a super friendly guy. He was really interested in our thoughts on the menu as they had put so much prep and thought into their serving style. He remembered us from our first visit, too. \\n\\nDefinitely worth its salt.

A complete attic restoration entails removing all the old insulation and installing new insulation.  Don was very nice and polite but he talked me into overpaying for a useless service.  Don sold me on paying him $900 to \\"sanitize\\" my attic saying that many customers choose this service instead of the more expensive restoration and that they would give me a $700 discount on it if I did the complete restoration.  To do the \\"sanitizing\\" Don spent spent less than an hour spraying a solution on top of the rat feces and rat urine in the attic.  I should have realized this service was useless since they were not planning to clean the attic first.  Afterwards Don's estimate for the complete attic restoration was @ $5,000.  I had no interest in entrusting this company with more work and when I complained to Don that the $900 sanitizing fee was a rip off (something around $200 would have been appropriate considering the time spent), he refused to do anything unless I did the full restoration estimated @ $5,000.

If this is the first time you get to know this cuisine, you may find it similar to Shanghainese although they do have quite a few spicy dishes.\\n\\nThe restaurant is cozy and plain but clean. One of their larger tables can fit 6 people comfortably. There are booths and standard 4-seater and 2-seater tables. The huge mounted TV always plays local TV shows from China. The server is an older Chinese lady who speaks Mandarin. She was friendly to me and I found her extremely patient even though there were at times 4 tables of customers and they all needed service simultaneously. I wouldn't blame her for being slow as she was the only server.\\n\\nI had tried 3 of their dishes so far:\\n- Shredded pork and pickled cabbage with thin noodle in soup\\n- Pork, fungus/wooden ear and egg fried noodle\\n- Egg and chives pan seared pocket (vegetarian)\\n\\nAll of their noodles and buns are handcrafted. I love their authenticity! The flavour was like something I have tried in Asia. The portion of noodle and toppings was perfect and on the generous side. The seasoning was on point. The dishes I have tried so far were so fresh and delicious. The chef made the outer bun layer of the pocket. The pan searing adds texture to the bun skin. Every bite is screaming juicy and flavourful eggs and chives! The texture of the fried noodle is the same type I had in my noodle in soup. Again the flavour was on point! Adding their homemade chilly oil to the already delicious food is like icing on the cake. So yummy!\\n\\nThe chef is an older Chinese gentleman. He came to the dining area quickly for some reason. Their existing menu is from a restaurant called Szechuan Taste Restaurant. I think it could be the restaurant he previously owned before relocating to here.\\n\\nThis place has been opened since October 2018 and conveniently located across Metrotown on Kingsway and Sussex.

Under snacks we got the house made bread and the crab French fries. The house bread was absolutely delicious and included ink squid bread which was surprisingly amazing. The crab french fries is exactly what it sounds like. There are some crab flakes sprinkled on top of the french fries with the crab sauce. This was probably my least favorite dish simply for the fact that it was extremely salty. Next we got the steak tartare and the soft shell crab. The steak tartare with eloquently cooked with savory donuts to top.

Inquiring about catering was a real pain here. First we called and they said they don't deliver, which we thought was incorrect because we know they have catering. So, we went in to discuss catering in person.  The catering person (Duane) couldn't be bothered to speak with us.  I think the other employees were embarrassed to have to tell us (twice) that \\"He's in a bad mood today. I'll see if I can get him to come out here and talk to you.\\"  Needless to say, Duane didn't want to, so he didn't because \\"he's getting ready to take a break.\\"  15 minutes later Duane decided to grace us with his presence and plopped down at our table without any kind of introduction.  He asked us nothing about the catering, he just stated that he doesn't cater for less than 50 people and that was that.  He was gone in 20 seconds.\\n\\nOur catering order was for 35 people.  It's for our new business location 2 blocks away (this was a great \\"welcome to the neighborhood!\\") with delivery---no set-up required.

How did this place get four stars?\\n\\nMy sister made reservations for brunch today for four adults and a baby. When we arrived, we were brought to a table with extra chairs, no offer of a sling for the baby or to help to move the chairs to accommodate the stroller. \\n\\nWhen the server came to the table we had asked for ice water. We received room temperature water with no ice, no lemon. I ordered the lobster bisque and salmon crepe. My partner ordered the French dip. My sister ordered beignets for the table. I informed the server that we had a seafood allergy at the table so it's really important that my food comes out separately to avoid the risk of my food touching my partner's. He replied that they wouldn't touch but he'd bring mine out with the beignets. Classy restaurants usually take food allergies seriously and take steps to make sure the kitchen is aware to avoid cross contamination- this place could care less.\\n\\nThe \\"beignets\\" arrive at the table along with my lobster bisque. The quotes are because I don't see how they can get away with calling these beignets. Beignets are large pillowy pieces of deep fried heaven. This was six tiny round pieces of dense deep fried dough that were half the size of a donut hole. For this experience they charge $8.\\n\\nMy lobster bisque had good flavor, but had almost zero lobster. There were a couple of tiny specs of chewy something at the bottom of the bowl, too small to be identified as lobster. Seriously...I've gotten more lobster in the $4 lobster bisque from Walmart. For this, they charge $11.\\n\\nNo visit from the server and no pepper on the table. I flag him down as he's walking by to ask for pepper, and he grabs the pepper mill. No offer to refill empty water glasses, despite a fairly empty restaurant.\\n\\nNext, my \\"salmon\\" crepe and partner's French dip arrive at the table - together. Again, zero regard to food allergies. My sister has to get up to grab the pepper mill herself because our server is absent. Now, you see I used quotes again. That's because my $17 salmon crepe turned out to have NO SALMON! I unfolded the crepe and all that was in there was herb cream cheese. Of course, no visit from the server so we flag him down as he was walking by and he just replied that he will ask his manager to remove it from our bill. No offer to replace it. My partner's $17 French dip sandwich had a minuscule amount of tasteless beef on it. Better quality can be obtained from Arby's.\\n\\nFinally, we request the bill and for it to be split according to couples. My brother in law's breakfast was on my bill and my partner's French dip was on theirs. We ask the server to correct it and he lets out a sigh to show his annoyance with the request.\\n\\nI don't know if this restaurant is struggling financially and this is why they kept trying to swindle us with the proteins or of the owners are delusional enough to think people will pay these prices and think the food is good enough to not notice the meat is missing (it's not). There are far too many great restaurants at the Domain to pay this one another visit.

The space itself is larger than appearing from the outside - there is some outdoor seating, but a good amount of indoor seating as well. You order at the counter, and they bring the food to you - I like this setup, expedites things a little bit and makes it easier for larger groups of people. \\n\\nI think of Sweet Carrot like a Chipotle - you pick your base and protein and then get all the goodies with it too. I heard good things about the corn cake, so went with that as my base. I'm not a huge cornbread fan, but  this corn cake was super moist and had actual corn pieces in it, which made it even better. It was griddled too, which gave it a little extra crisp to add to the flavor. I topped the cake with pulled pork, which was an excellent pair - it was perfectly sauced (not too overwhelming, but still flavorful!) and perfectly tender. The whole dish is topped with their house-made coleslaw (a non-mayo base, which I appreciate - tangy yet refreshing!), corn salsa (nice balance of sweet with a tiny bit of spice), and an unlabeled sauce (a little tangy but not overwhelming, pulled the dish together). I loved all the flavors together, and the portion size was perfect - could finish the whole thing but didn't feel super gross afterwards. I also heard good things about the mac and cheese, but I felt that it might have been a little too rich with all the toppings - however, my fellow diner raved about the pairing! We finished our meals with some carrot cake, a must at a place with \\"carrot\\" in the title. The cake was delicious - the right amount of spice in the cake and decadent yet not overly sweet cream cheese frosting.

Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick to recommend his favorite taco. \\n\\nWe started with an amazingly cheese queso dip that left us wanting more. The tacos were about palm sized with a blast of flavor. The chipotle slaw added a refreshing touch. I had two Bistec steak tacos and the Short Rib Taco. Due to the portion sizes, I left feeling satisfied but not over filled which was a nice change from what I am typically used to with eating tacos. \\n\\nSo why didn't I give this restaurant 5 stars? My problem is that these tacos are not worth $4 each. For the size that they are, they should cost $3 each or even $2.50.

I looove Taiwanese food so I really wanted to try this place out. It definitely hit the spot.\\n\\nWe stuck with only small plate items because we wanted to try multiple things for a cheap-ish price. \\n\\n_ Salt and pepper chicken ($5.5): if you're going to get anything at all, I'd recommend getting this at least. The flavor is spot on, and the chicken is pretty juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. This definitely reminded me of my time in Taiwan getting fried chicken. For the amount of chicken you get, the price is a steal. \\n\\n_ Lu rou fan ($5.5): this is my faaaavorite Taiwanese dish, but I felt just alright with this. The flavor was standard, but not quite out of the ballpark, unfortunately. I think the biggest miss about this dish is there wasn't much meat over the rice. There is a good amount of sauce though, and plenty of rice. The photos posted on Yelp makes it look like there is so much more meat than there actually was. \\n\\n_ Pickled Veggies ($3): SO GOOD. The pickled cucumber is served in a separate bowl than the carrots and daikon, but I could legit just snack on these veggies all day. It really is a great dish to balance out the other dishes. \\n\\n_ Taiwanese Noodles / Gan Mein ($7): I thought this tasted really great! This was my bf's favorite of the what we ordered. Make sure to mix it really well because most of the chopped ingredients sink towards the bottom. \\n\\n_ Stir-fried Xiang Chang ($9): I personally don't think this is worth the cost. The Taiwanese sausage is a bit sweet, which is great, but not quite as sweet as the Chinese sausage you can find at any Asian grocery store. The lotus root with the sauce is pretty delicious though. Again, I don't think this dish is worth the cost, but it's pretty flavorful overall.\\n\\nLastly, the service was really great. They are pretty attentive and make sure you're well taken care of.

So, as a result, I've sampled my fair share of Blue Star donuts at two of the locations. \\n\\nAt this Hawthorne location, the service was always good, and surprisingly quick. Don't expect personal service, however, this place is busy and lines often form. \\n\\nFirst off, consider yourself lucky if you can capture the magical unicorn that is known as the chicken fried donut. I stood outside that location doing a survey over the course of a couple of weekends, and never remember it being available. I'm sure it is, but it must sell out in minutes. I have a feeling I'd need a DeLorean with a Flux Capacitor to travel back in time a few hours to reserve one before they sell out.\\n\\nGet to the point, you ask? Ok.\\n\\nAnything with the blueberry glaze is the best thing I've had there. \\n\\nGreen tea/matcha donut is my second flavorite.  \\n\\nChocolate ganache rounds out the third place on my list.\\n\\nWorst thing I've had at Blue Star:\\n\\nThe carrot cake donut was shockingly bland. I'm not big on overly sweet treats (I know, I'm weird), but this was so bland I had to ADD sugar to it when I brought it home to eat. My wife, who is a baker, agreed and was disappointed. If you want a donut that tastes like a crumbly dinner roll with the vague flavor of carrot, you'll enjoy it. It was far blander than any actual carrot cake I've had.\\n\\nPersonally, I wasn't impressed enough with all the donuts I had to drive me to return to Blue Star regularly. I get that might not be the trendy answer, but it's my honest one. It's hit or miss with the flavors, which range from pleasantly sweet to bland.\\n\\nRecently, I've had Pip's donuts..which blow away Blue Star in quality and flavor."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"My fianc√© and I eat at Brazilian steakhouses every chance we get, when visiting major cities.

I really enjoyed my nachos, and the vegan/vegetarian chorizo on it was so good! I do wish there had been more of the queso, but that's ok. My friend said her burger didn't have much flavor. The citizen fries were normal fries with some type of seasoning, and they came with aioli and ketchup. Unfortunately, the aioli was really tangy and the ketchup tasted like marinara sauce.

The food was ok, on the higher end, but nothing to rave home about. My friends also thought it was decent. \\n\\nI came again last night just for drinks and they have a good enough selection of house cocktails, the one I ordered wasn't that great, it was called Skinny Jeans, but some of the others that my friends had were quite tasty (Painkiller and Strawberry Capirioska). The service was good nothing to complain about, our waitress checked in on us quite a few times, making sure we had what we needed.\\n\\nOverall I think it's a nice edition to East Boston, for drinks and views I would definitely come again, but I think I'll skip on the food."},{"name":"Pizzeria Ludica","address":"189 Keefer Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

There are regular height tables and tables that're a little higher so request for regular chairs if you can. \\n\\nMy go-to is the Shirodashi pork ramen. It comes with pork belly, bamboo, greens, seaweed, egg, and clear broth. The pork belly is hit-or-miss. Sometimes it's cooked to perfection with an almost-burnt texture (the way I like my pork belly cooked). But sometimes it's barely cooked enough. The broth is quite greasy. The portions are pretty big so that's never a problem. The way the ramen is cooked is also highly variable - sometimes very overcooked, sometimes a little undercooked, and occasionally just right. \\n\\nI also get their gyoza. I hate that all of their gyoza comes with water chestnut so if you don't like this, don't get it.

The aesthetics are lovely - dark woods, oranges, earth tones - it really creates an upscale atmosphere while remaining loyal to Animal Kingdom Lodge. \\n\\nWe were started with some sweet potato bread served with compound butter. This was a nice starter - the sweet potato bread was a unique twist which added a layer of flavor to the bread. For my app I had their signature pork tenderloin.

The atmosphere is cozy,  with walls plastered in vintage French posters and advertisements.\\n\\nThe key is to order off the fixed price menu. I compiled a delicious meal consisting of white wine, salad, salmon & vegetables, and chocolate mousse (which was fantastic). One of the staff is fluent in French, which I found delightful. Having been a french maid for Halloween - I was curious as to what the phrase \\"je vous veux\\" meant, as my friends told me I should just repeat it since I needed to pretend to speak french. The waiter smirked when I asked him - \\"je vous veux? That means 'I want you'\\". Ha! So that is what I was telling everyone that night.\\n\\nBut back to the subject - the loveliness of Chez Nous. There were couples there on a romantic date, small groups of friends enjoying a night out, older children out with their parents, and one large group out celebrating a birthday. Even though it was packed, you never felt rushed to finish your meal and move out. Long conversations almost seemed encouraged. \\n\\nNow that I know what it has to offer, I look forward to venturing off the fixed price menu into some even more delectable territory. \\n\\nOh Chez Nous, je vous veux."},{"name":"The Peached Tortilla","address":"3600 Presidential Blvd, East Food Court","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I come here every single time I go to the airport, which is more often than most people.

I'd bet it'd be popular with both the parents with toddlers and the hipsters with laptops I saw here.      \\n \\nThe two specific pastries I wanted to try - Victoria Sponge & Bakewell Tart - were long gone by 2pm, but now I know.

As I had to grab some burritos from Big Momma's for the ride home, I convinced him to try somewhere new in Grandview Heights. I did a trusty Yelp search and found this little place just a couple of blocks away.\\n\\nGrand Day Cafe is a cute tiny restaurant located in a strip mall in the middle of Grandview Heights. It's very unassuming, and has a blue awning to differentiate itself from the surrounding businesses. They advertise free coffee before 8, but there's no way in hell I'm getting up that early on my own agenda. Anywho, my dad and I walked in and were seated immediately.\\n\\nThe server only took maybe a minute to come over, and she instantly filled up our coffee cups and welcomed us. My dad noted that the menu has a large amount of chorizo offerings; he was hopeful that they wouldn't skim like most restaurants. I found the menu to be eclectic and I easily chose the shrimp benedict with avocado on the side. I also elected to have my hashbrowns \\"Grandview\\" style with onions, cheese and jalapenos. \\n\\nThe food came out very fast, especially considering the restaurant wasn't exactly empty. Everything was fresh and delicious, and my Benedict was looooaded with shrimp. My dad was also impressed by the amount of chorizo they put in his omelet - they definitely don't skimp here. The food was excellent, and the server was on top of her game, albeit I did feel a little rushed toward the end of the meal. My dad's not the fastest eater in the game and I didn't find the hovering toward the end of our meal an attractive touch. Also, I did find the hollandaise on my Benedict to be a tad too lemony for my taste; as we all know, hollandaise is a lemony, buttery type of sauce so it's probably just my personal preference that this particular hollandaise didn't hit.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a solid breakfast place with amazing food for good prices.

I love the Orange and Olive Oil (my husband's favorite) so much because it's sweet and savory and not too much of either. It's balanced and delightful. The Blueberry Basil, is my son's favorite, and my choice when I really want a lot of flavor. It's a palate pleaser as it gives you a lot of good flavors all at once. It has this tart tang that I just love. It's not sour just a zing! The Passionfruit Cake is the only one I wasn't crazy about. The tart zing on it was just way too much zing for me.

The best thing is the margaritas. Excellent taste and these are really refreshing if it's hot. The salsa is also very good. They have many different kinds. \\n\\nI thought the margaritas were the best. It has specialty margaritas for about $11 a glass and $33 a pitcher. Patron Anejo is made with Grand Marnier, and Patron Silver is made with Cointeracas. It also has regular margaritas for about $9. Lemonhead is made with 1800, Raspberry is made with Herradurra Silver, and Skinny is made with Hornitos. The rest of the meal was not as memorable. It's a New Mexican menu instead of Tex-Mex which is still a lot the same. The lunch menu is not available on weekends. It has several vegetarian options that are marked on the menu. Sauces that are vegetarian are the ana suzi barbecue sauce and the mild ranchero sauce. The vegetable fajitas was pretty bland. It was also overpriced for the quality. This was $12, came with a few crusty and tiny tortillas, and was unseasoned. It has some other vegetarian items like black bean burrito. This is pretty good with the ranchero. The blue corn nachos come with choice of protein. One choice is the pinto beans. The veggie burrito is $9 or $10, and it's better than the fajitas. \\n\\nI recommend Chile Verde for the margaritas. The food is not worth it but still is not bad.

I liked the pita bread, but it would have been better if I had something to dip it in... \\n\\nI ordered the spinach pies to share for an appetizer. It was okay, but had a bit of a sour taste. Not my favorite. For dinner, my friend got a bowl of chickpea and chicken soup. She said it was good, but it was lukewarm, so that was disappointing. Her husband got the burger. He asked for it to be medium, but it was definitely well-done. Also, it had a gamey taste to it. Interesting, for sure. I wanted to try something new, so I got the Kafta sandwich. I liked it, but the meat was also very well done and tough to eat. I wasn't a fan of the pickles on the sandwich- it didn't compliment the flavors. \\n\\nI asked for tzaiki  sauce, which I got right away, but I was never told about an upcharge. When I got my bill, I was very disappointed to see a $3 charge for maybe 2 tablespoons of sauce!!! Ridiculous. \\n\\nOverall, I think Meza has some kinks to work out. I know this is to be expected, but we were not thrilled with our experience tonight."},{"name":"The Caboose Bar","address":"1827 North Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to go to The Caboose a lot in 2009-10 (I believe it opened in '09), but haven't been there much in the past 6 months or so. It's definitely a place I'd like to go to more often, and I recommend it for those who have yet to visit. The last time I was there, the bar was beer (and maybe wine?) only (i.e. no liquor). As one reviewer already pointed out, the bar has begun serving food, which I've yet to try. I'm way overdue for a visit here, so if I go soon and remember to update my review, I definitely will. Be sure to drop by on Friday evenings, if you can; from 6 p.m.-7 p.m., the bar offers beer for a nickel apiece (I believe the beer is Miller Lite or something along those lines - not anything you want!).

While this was one of the most memorable and enjoyable Disney meals I've had there were also some things I didn't like about it. Several of my fellow Disney nerds can't believe that it took me until 2019 to try Be Our Guest but it's true.  It's incredibly popular and is one of the hardest reservations to score.  When I saw one late night slot open on the day we would be there I had to jump on it. The theming is just off the charts fantastic. There are giant gargoyles guarding the large door you enter to get into the castle's first chamber. There's the iconic stained glass window with Belle and Beast you can take photos in front of along with more gargoyles holding up castle columns.  I was baffled as to why there was an empty room with suits of armor and display screens with song lyrics on them. It turns out this is where you order from if you're not there for dinner. The main ballroom is just stunning with an intricately decorated ceiling and giant sweeping windows that look out onto a \\"snowstorm\\" outside of the castle.\\n\\nMy reaction to the food was pretty much the opposite of what I expected. Normally I don't like onion soup at all but I thought theirs was just delicious, especially the cheese that they layered on top. I got the chicken entree and it was also quite good. I am a dessert fanatic and was so excited to finally be trying the fabled grey stuff from here. I was shocked that I was a little underwhelmed with dessert.  Your three items come on what looks like a pieces of paper with a pretty stained glass picture printed on it.  The surprise is that you can eat the paper, which is fun for silly photos.  The part that isn't surprising is that it also tastes like paper. The grey stuff was good but I only got a tiny dollop in a cute while chocolate mold of Chip (from the movie). Along with that were a tiny macaroon and a tiny truffle. Honestly I would have been a lot happier with replacing all of that with a slice of cake with the grey stuff on top.\\n\\nMy other complaint was with the seating. The table for two is way too small and felt quite cramped.  Also, in the main ballroom the tables are way, WAY too close to each other. While I did have a nice conversation with the family sitting next to me it shouldn't feel like you're eating with the tables next to you. The two rooms on the side don't seem to have this issue as much and I would much rather prefer to sit there next time.  The benefit of getting a late reservation is that the place started to clear out. It's really nice being able to wander around after your meal and soak in all of the details the imagineers put into this place. Plus you can get your photo taken with Beast if you eat dinner there. Overall this was a great meal and I would eat here again."},{"name":"Portugalia","address":"723 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I had steak there some time ago and it was delicious.\\n\\nIt gets a lower review because of appearance."},{"name":"El Vaquero Mexican Restaurant","address":"3580 W Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"This is the first location I've been to in about 15 years.

Is it the most authentic Mexican place around? Heck no. And we all know that. There's only a small handful of new, exciting (pseudo-)authentic Mexi establishments beginning to make their mark around Boston. This is surely not one of them.\\n\\nWhat this one has that others don't - it's not a chain, for starters. I'm looking at you, Besito, Margaritas, and Acapulco's! It has decent food.

The bar is comfortable, bartenders are great, the drinks outstanding, and TV monitors to enjoy. Not interested in that? Well, why not cozy up next to their huge open-air windows - Assembly Row wasn't set up for this shop to have outdoor seating, so instead they bring the outside to you as best they can.\\n\\nLemme go back to the drinks for a moment.

I'm not sure who's training their folks or how management can turn such a seriously blind eye on this fact. #JustPlainAwful.\\n\\nBut this is a rare occurrence where I'd say its strengths can (and should) outshine its weaknesses. So I'm giving a 3-star establishment my coveted 4 stars instead. Because I, myself, would frequent this space far more often if I could.

It was about 10p so I was almost willing to settle for what Miller's was offering but then I went to the bathroom. There was toilet paper pieces on the floor and a disgusting feminine product sitting in the toilet . That did it for me. It was not busy at all and having worked years in two different restaurants I know bathroom checks should be performed regularly at least every half hour if not every 15 minutes when busy. That's what the form on the back of the bathroom door in most restaurants is for FYI. But, I didn't see one in here.

I LOVED the noodles. I believe they are sun noodles (I forgot to ask so I can't be 100% sure), but they used what seemed to be a thicker variety than sun noodles I've eaten at Pikaichi and elsewhere. I love thick, chewy noodles so that was a huge win for me. Toppings were pretty standard (corn, bean sprouts, scallion). I skipped the corn and added menma, which came on the side and was very tasty.  The pork had a nice flavor and was well cooked but it was thinly sliced. Personally I prefer thick cut chashu, but it wasn't bad. The broth was pretty disappointing. It was a little bland. I didn't get much miso flavor at all and I felt it was lacking a little richness. Definitely not the punch of flavor we came to know and love at Pikaichi. It did have a good heat level though and was a good thickness. I think this too could be improved with a bit of tweaking. \\n\\nThe service was very friendly and genuine. Still a little rough around the edges (could have been quicker with refilling waters, forgot to drop a pen to sign the receipt), but these are not a huge deal to me at all and they'll improve after they've been open more than a few days for sure!!

The chicken was cooked so well, it matches perfectly with literally any of their pasta dishes!

The Consulate is amazing. We dined there with another couple on a Friday night and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. To be honest, I hadn't heard of this place until recently. It just hadn't made it to my radar somehow which is surprising as unique and delicious it is. \\n\\nThe concept is genius. They offer a \\"visa\\" menu that rotates every 90 days. Each visa menu features cuisine from a different country. They also have a \\"resident\\" menu that features mainstays as well as some of the favorites from previous visa menus. One of my favorite things to say about nicer ATL restaurants is that they REALLY have to stand out to bring me back a second time. With all the new places opening day in and day out, there are just too many to try to go back to the same place again and again. This is why The Consulate gets it right with their concept. They are giving the dinner something to look forward to with the promise of a new menu every 90 days. \\n\\nWhen we went, the visa menu featured items from China. The dishes are tapas style, which gave us the opportunity to try multiple things. We ordered a black fungi salad and vegetable dumplings from the China menu and an eggplant stack sandwich (The Expat), and brussel sprouts from the resident menu. Everything was amazing and well presented. I definitely appreciate the numerous vegetarian options, too. A lot of ATL restaurants can only build you a plate using sides so it is refreshing to have multiple options! \\n\\nThe cocktails we ordered were delicious but they took forever to come out. One person in our party ordered a glass of wine and even that took a long time to come out. We actually received some of our food before our drinks. This is my only negative comment. The drink service needs to improve. I would have ordered a second cocktail but I didn't want to get it after all of my food was gone so I decided not to. Other than that, the service was good. Our server took time to go over their concept and one of the owners stopped by to say hello.\\n\\nLast but not least, the interior of this place is amazing. It reminds me of a 1940's train car / speak easy. The lighting, the art, and the seating are all globally inspired and imaginative. If indoor smoking was legal I would have definitely wanted to light up a cigar. Make sure you check out the awesome bathrooms, too. No detail left undone! The ambiance is perfect for groups, date night, special occasion, or even just a drink. Note that parking is available for free in the lot located on W. Peachtree and 10th St. Make sure to get your ticket validated.\\n\\nOverall, The Consulate exceeded my expectations and we will definitely be back when the menu changes to Moroccan cuisine in Oct, 2018."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday and it was definitely not busy.

I believe it costs extra but totally worth it!!  For lunch, I believe it's $25.95 per person.  I believe the price should be lowered to $19.99 for the value of the meats served.  It's a bit over priced.  \\n\\n      I was waiting for the Pichana steak to come out but they didn't have this here.\\n\\n      All in all, I may come back as it was decent.

These are the places that are usually local and  chef-owned.  You'll find fresh baked breads, jams, and creative options. First Watch is an example of a chain that is of this type.  \\n\\n2- the proverbial Greasy Spoon.  The best Greasy Spoons to me are solid because they have the right flavors and done right.  Things like crispy bacon, home fries with onions, and charred bits of flavor from a well worn grill.  They might not be gourmet, but they have flavor and personality. \\n\\nAvalon Diner is neither of these types if places.  It's not terrible.  There is nothing \\"wrong\\" per se, but there's little to make you want to get up and fo there, either.  The menu is very basic. The ingredients are generic - and remind me of over processed Sysco stuff.  And while clean and comfortable, there is little charm.  You could be sitting in any town, any state.  \\n\\nExample, my usual cheese omelet comes fluffy, with cheese slices on the top.  There is really no flavor.  There's no browning, there's no flavor of butter or even oil, let alone salt and pepper.  It's the same flavor you'd get if you microwaved an egg and unwrapped a Kraft single to drape over it.  Toast is made for breads that are like Wonder bread -airy, light (not in a good way), and spread with margarine.  It's consistently toasted too light, and never has it been hot -keeping with the bland theme.  The hash browns are bland, not crispy, not seasoned. The jam is foil packets of Smuckers.  The pancakes taste like they're probably a mix, served with more of that cheap butter / margarine blend and cold packets of syrup.  \\n\\nI guess the one thing they do right is service. We're regulars and the server (his name is Justin I think) is super enthusiastic and helpful.

My friend suggested it, having once been to a different location. I haven't been to many fast casual places, but I really think this one executes the concept wonderfully. \\n\\nUpon entering, a staff member greeted and presented us with menus. We walked up to the registers, where a friendly young lady took our orders. I knew I wanted a chicken panini and soup, but could not decide on a soup. She recommended a couple and I chose the creamy chicken vegetable. I opted for a fountain drink, although there were lots of bottled/canned drink options, in addition to wine and beer. \\n\\nAfter ordering, we got our drinks and found a table. The food came out pretty quickly. The panini was pretty darn good. The soup was good, but less impressive. I think I'll have to try a different kind next time. But the panini! Oh my. And there was a little mini-croissant included. And a lollipop! I am a dessert junkie and always want something sweet after meals, so this little treat was definitely a plus! \\n\\nMy friend ordered the salmon panini, which she said was delicious and a bit messy. It came with a choice of chips or an apple. She chose the apple, and it came out sliced and lined up all nice and neat. According to her, Panera gives you a whole apple, so we both thought the slices were a nice detail. Definitely a lot easier to eat. \\n\\nOh yes, I must remark on their tea. I usually either get unsweetened or mix it half and half with sweetened tea. I don't like overly sweet drinks if they're being accompanied by food. Their flavored sweetened tea was PERFECT. Lightly sweetened with natural sweeteners (I can always tell an artificially sweetened drink by the nasty aftertaste it leaves in my mouth) and with a hint of cinnamon. I imagine, since it's just labeled \\"flavored,\\" that there is a variety that changes daily. \\n\\nMy meal plus drink came to $10.02. Not a bad price at all for food that is actual food, fresher and of better quality than something from a drive-through. \\n\\nWe walked here, so I don't know how parking works.

Unfortunately they ran out of it and that's the only thing he wanted, since he had already eaten before hand and was just keeping us company. \\n\\nTwo of us started with the wonton soup. Super goood! I've never really liked wonton soup anywhere at a restaurant because they don't always prepare it well, but this place... This is it. I've found my place to get wonton soup. \\n\\nWe then had the pork belly bun and shrimp bun. Again, really good. I slightly like the shrimp bun better because I'm a huge seafood fan but the pork belly bun is still really delicious. They were both prepared really well and had a nice presentation to it.\\n\\nAnd finally, we ended with Lu Rou Fan, which is braised pork on rice. This dish is absolutely phenomenal! They give just the right of meat and it also comes with half of a hard-boiled egg that was braised with the pork, and a pickled vegetable. Probably one of my favorite dishes. \\n\\nA couple of critiques about the place: \\nIf you go later in the evening, they might run out of certain items. I hope they try to fully stock their kitchen so that this problem doesn't have to occur. \\nSeating is limited so you might want to try to call ahead if you have a big party. \\n\\nAs a summary, this is probably one of my favorite restaurants that I've been to so far. It's been consistent for the last two times I've been and I hope it stays just as good for my many future visits to this place. Bear in mind that the portion size is small, but that's why it's priced the way it's priced.

However, this rating is related to their professional conduct. \\n\\nI'm planning to have family in town for an event, so I am looking for a restaurant that will host twelve people (most restaurants handle twelve people walk-ins every weekend). I called Waypoint and explained that I'd like to have a table for twelve in one month during which we'd like to order thirty or so small plates with everyone also purchasing alcohol. This would come to a bill of $800 or more. I was told on the phone that that would not be an issue, but if I would like, I could email the manager to put my request in writing and so that the manager could plan for the event. I emailed the manager with my reservation plan. She responded by telling me that in order to have a table for twelve, I would need to do a fixed menu at $85/person before beverages, tax, and gratuity. So what went from a set plan at an already expensive restaurant turned into an ultimatum at an egregious price. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I thanked the manager for her time and decided to look elsewhere. I'm honestly just really disappointed that a local restaurant would behave so unprofessionally to a local consumer.

I was a bit confused by this place as it looks like a church - turns out the restaurant is in the converted cafeteria for a Montessori school which I believe is still in business? In any case the building is a wonderful brick modernist with an interesting brick textured wall - if you ever get a chance to attend an event in the banquet hall it's inside the main church building and features a wooden  tongue-and-groove ceiling and beautiful curved exposed beams - it's stunning.\\n\\nOnce you enter the building you'll find something a bit food-court-ish or cafeteria-like with simple chairs and tables like you would find in any school. You order at the counter, grab your drink and wait for your name to be called. The smells are wonderful - full of spice and promise, which Zyka delivers in spades. My only objection is the extensive use of styrofoam - wish they would get reusable plates but perhaps the use of disposables are due to some constraints in the kitchen? In any case be careful in your ordering as while the portions look small, the food is very rich and filling.\\n\\nFrom a cuisine standpoint the food here taste more Indian and less Pakistani - perhaps more Nepalese, with strong, distinctive flavors and less of the oiliness you find in straight up Pakistani - if you like any of these you'll love the food here. My favorite hands-down is the tandoori chicken - think BBQ with an Indian twist - this is some of the best I've had in Atlanta.\\n\\nTandoori Chicken Appetizer - Skinless chicken leg quarter marinated in spicy homemade yogurt and freshly ground spices, skewered then roasted on a chargrill - while not the classic baked in the super-hot tandoori oven, this rendition gains from the grill - nice caramelization on the exterior with a bit of char.\\n\\nChicken 65 - this is a great rendition of this classic dish - here it has a bit of a saucy exterior, while deep-fried it's a bit wetter and not as crisp, sort of like a boneless chicken wing but without the wing sauce. Served with fresh sliced jalapeno (yeah I know this latter is a bit weird but seems to be the going thing for this dish in the southeast).\\n\\nChicken Biryani - Aged basmati rice cooked over chicken meat marinated in yogurt and spices then flavored with Spanish Saffron. I thought this good but as usually I want more chicken pieces!\\n\\nChicken Tikka Masala - Chicken breast nuggets roasted in a tandoori oven and served in a roasted cashew nut, almond, onion gravy. Good and slightly oily. \\n\\nAloo Gobi - Cauliflower florets and cubed potatoes infused with fresh tomatoes, garlic, fresh mint, cilantro and cumin seeds - this is a bit different from what I'm used to  - more wet rather than dry.\\n\\nNaan - the breads here are just a bit more bread-y along the outside edges - More Nepalese or Bangladeshi - very fresh and property cooked in a tandoori oven.\\n\\nIn all I liked the food here quite a bit - all the flavors were very distinct and authentic to my palate. The service here is also very good considering the cafeteria-like setting. Whether you're new to Indian or Pakistani food or a veteran, I think you'll enjoy Zyka and by the crowds, it has quite a few fans - about time for you to become one too!\\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Houndstooth Kitchen & Eatery","address":"160 Independence Ln, Ste A","city":"Maitland","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely LOVE LOVE this place!

The berry one had a lingering aftertaste of something that neither of us could place. The chocolate was wham, bam, thank you maim with nothing hanging around after. Neither cupcake could hold a candle (is that a thing people say?) to the pineapple upside down cake. Again, perfectly moist, sticky, with big pineapple rings. This cake is what all fruit desserts should strive to be. I tried to eat only a little and save the rest for later but that didn't happen. I scarfed the entire thing right then and there. #NoRegrets. I didn't eat any of the frosting shot because my daughter was too busy wearing it on her face like a dessert badge of honor. She loved it.\\n\\nThe most amazing part of Erin McKenna's bakery?

Drinks are also very good, loved the Gin Mule! \\n\\nIt gets quite busy and they don't take reso so try to go early. They also don't have a seating time limit at the moment so it's kind of annoying waiting for a table after first sitting when everyone is done and drinking/chatting. \\nNice for the people seated but not when there is multiple groups waiting outside.

Well, when the bill came they charged him $25 for that little breast.  We were really thrown back.  Seriously, all he wanted was a little chicken side.  We told the waitress that this couldn't seriously be the cost and said he only wanted a little chicken like they put on top of a salad or whatever.

She didn't even look twice at our raggedy, smelly, post-festival road trip outfits (we were so thankful). I ordered two veggie tacos ($1.50 each) with a side of rice and beans, and she offered me the taco plate which was $4.99 for the same thing, thereby saving me money. The veggie tacos were loaded with beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. The beans had cheese on them, and the rice was full of flavor. The helpings for both were so huge that I didn't even finish my whole meal. \\n\\nThey have a wide selection of salsas to choose from, and you don't have to pay for any of them on the side.

Definitely recommend!!"},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I am going to chock this one up as another \\"too trendy for its own good\\" restaurant.  \\n\\nThe space is the now-standard \\"minimal loud open kitchen\\" setup, boasting a bar, a mezzanine, and a bunch of now-standard \\"community tables\\" at which separate parties can uncomfortably be crammed together for a meal.  The decor is white and wood, but does a good enough job of not being too stark.  I guess it helped that none of the lights were on except those in the kitchen, and the majority of illumination came by candle. \\n\\nThe service was good, nothing to complain about. Quick, attentive, and ready with knowledge about the menu items.\\n\\nThe menu - this is what it's all about, right?  Lots of very non-traditional and creative items.  Beet salad, popcorn, a 5-hour egg with salsa verde, chicken fried chicken livers, and similar, start off the appetizer and salad lists.  Entrees consist of a range of meat/starch combos that push the edge of edginess, like pork belly over black-eyed peas with chorizo, rabbit, a half chicken, and a hangar steak with, of course, some creative sauce.  They also have at least one vegetarian option (no vegan food), and one fish option.  A few pasta dishes and roasted veggie sides round out the offerings. The wine list and cocktail menu are equally as trendy/nuveau, with lots of new world wines and a combination of \\"creative\\" cocktails.  \\n\\nI had been recommended the pork belly, which I ordered, along with the 5-hour egg. The wife ordered some fries (with harissa and creme fraiche), some roasted veggies, and the beet salad.  The egg was very interesting. It was actually 1.5 eggs, and had been roasted in sea salt for 5 hours, giving the egg a nutty flavor, which was pretty overpowered by the salsa verde on top. It was good, but not quite $5 good. I was impressed by the sublime combination of flavors that I never would have guessed to be good together.  The pork belly, while looking delicious, lacked inspiration.  It was, of course, fatty and salty, but not all that much more than fatty and salty. There was some dimension missing, and I still this morning am not sure what it was. I was underwhelmed.\\n\\nThe fries were good enough, but nothing to Yelp about.  The beet salad with shiso, greens, and some funky dressing was quite good. That was probably the star of the meal, save for the fact that the shiso was so intense that was the overwhelming flavor of the dish.  It was definitely something I would order again, along with possibly that 5-hour egg.  The roasted root veggies were done perfectly, but somewhat slathered in either butter or oil. Between the pork belly and the roasted veg, I felt like I had an oil slick around the rim of my mouth when I was done.\\n\\nAll in all, what I found was a nothing-new approach to dining with a valiant yet non-delivering attempt at gourmet fusion food.  I will not particularly be rushing back to drop $22 on a prok belly entree any time in the near future.\\n\\nThat said, CC has a market waiting for it out there, and it will be crowded for some time to come.

This price is a bit ridiculous for hotpot frankly speaking.  \\n\\nSecond, the parking situation around this location is a nightmare during dinner time.  \\n\\nHowever, I am guessing that operating a business in the heart of Cambridge is not cheap either due to the high cost overall which might jack up their pricing. The parking situation is also a notorious problem of Cambridge. \\n\\nSo the conclusion is - if you love hotpot and lives in Cambridge, this place is worth a try but watch your wallet since it's not cheap - well if you're loaded, never mind.  If you do not live in Cambridge, I don't think it's worth the hassle to drive down here, circle around for a parking spot and pay premium to just have their hotpot."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Very friendly staff, many are from Italy.

Our experiences from the night ranged from some of my guest being very happy and some not so much.  The main issue we had with this restaurant was the service, the girl serving us was wonderful as she was knowledgeable and super quick on her feet.  We've been to this restaurant about 10 or so times so I wanted to have my birthday here.\\n\\nThe service was a set menu style, and me being an industry veteran for ten years and have been responsible for openings of 4 restaurants was surprised as to why they didn't ask for us to pick the menu ahead of time to give the kitchen time to prepare.\\n\\nThe food was very good as always, highly recommended.  There is a lot of value in what you get here for the price they charge, we were happy as always with the variety available.\\n\\nThe bartender was another story, drinks came slow enough without having him slow it down any further.  As the event was on a Sunday night, the restaurant only had about 8 other guest plus my group of 25.  The bartender literally opened several beers, put them on the counter and stared at the wall for 5-10 minutes before bringing them to anybody after waiting for the server who was obviously overwhelmed.\\n\\nSome of my guest only had 2 - 2.5 hours, the ones that had to leave still happily paid their full price for set menu however only received the first 2 of 4 or so courses.

You order food at a kiosk and then go find your own table. There is no explanation of the 3 dining rooms and how they are different.  We discovered after eating and walking thru that one dining room is really dark and might scare some kids. It represents when the beast was depressed and tore up the castle. \\n\\nWe ate in another side room that had a sculpture of Bell and the Beast dancing in the center as the focal point. Otherwise the room had lots of paintings and tapestries of Bell and Beast.  \\n\\nThe largest main dining room was better than ours we think. In one corner it had the rose in glass.  \\n\\nI think this venue is missing some storytelling as you are in the queue and something to set the mood. There was no music playing in the background and I thought that was strange too. \\n\\nAbout the food and service.  Dan ordered a beef dip and it was delivered with no au jus.  The meat juice that a beef dip requires.  I think it was just stale bread with nothing on it and meat.  The sandwiches come with fries and they are awful!  So hard you can hardly eat them.  I ate a couple and gave up on that.  We had also asked for ranch dressing and that and the au jus arrived 15 to 20 min after we got our food and we were done eTong when the waiter finally came bank. We were angry about this.  ReAlly poor service.  The only desert worth getting is the cream broulet.  The others are very small.  \\n\\nYou get your own drinks.

So instead of being in our feelings, we compensated with a bunch of small plates before ordering the pork kimchi dip soba.\\n\\nFor small plates, we ordered: tatsuta-age fried chicken, scallop hokkaiyaki, sashimi app, negi pon (pork belly) yakitori, and the million dollar roll.  The fried chicken amounted to chicken tenders with a mayo dip, not a must order unless you're travelling with a picky eight year-old.  Scallops were seasoned well but better physically described as a scallop sliver.  However, the pieces of sashimi were THICC.  Definitely a high-point of the meal.  The negi pon yakitori was fine, dipping sauce was a plus, but not reorder by any means.  My gf was happy with the million dollar roll, but she's also biased when it comes to any dish topped with those swaying fish flakes.\\n\\nThe pork kimchi dip soba was an...interesting order.  The soba noodles are served cold, separate from the hot bowl of pork kimchi soup served over a lit chafing dish.  The noodles themselves were great, firm and fresh.  The pork kimchi soup was more sour than tart, even a little too much for a dipping broth.  The pieces of pork were small and scarce, so ultimately you're geting soba to dip in sweet and sour sauce.  At the end of the meal, the waitress brought over sobayu (soba noodle cooking water) to pour into the remaining soup but at that point we were both done and wishing we'd ordered a different dip."},{"name":"Canton Buddha","address":"2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Ste 115","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The hostess/waiter/owner was very rude from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.

You'll have to find street parking on Cypress or the adjacent streets, but it wasn't really too difficult. There's no seating at the actual place, and I'm not sure if there will be, so be prepared to take it to go.\\n\\nWhen you first walk up, you'll actually order your meal at one side of the building and pick it up on the other. The lady running the order window was very friendly and accommodating. I'm not sure if the menu will grow, but that day they were offering ribs, pulled pork, and brisket, and you can choose from sides of mac and cheese and baked beans. For dessert, they have a bread pudding, and I highly suggest snagging this.\\n\\nFor $10, you get a platter that comes with two sides. You'll get six ribs or so. It's actually a pretty good deal. The sign says it comes with a bun, but none of us got one. You'll pick up your food on the other side of the building, and it comes out pretty quick.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, the meat wasn't very warm, and I'm not sure it was entirely because we got it to go. The ribs themselves were decent. Some of mine were a little tougher than others, and I actually had to pull out a serrated blade to get the last two apart. We weren't huge fans of the BBQ sauce. It was just a bit too plain and forgettable and could have used a kick. My friend got the pulled pork and wasn't blown away by that either. The mac and cheese was decent, but the baked beans really didn't set themselves apart from ones you'd snag from the grocery store.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the meal was actually the bread pudding. It was really really good! Granted, I don't get bread pudding often, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I really enjoyed it, and I recommend grabbing it if you go.\\n\\nOverall, I'm not sure I'll be back here any time soon, because the BBQ here just wasn't quite on par with some other spots in the city. It was opening day, so they have plenty of time to improve and add more to the menu. We all thought it'd be great if they offered more than one sauce (definitely one with some zing to it), and hopefully, they'll get some more sides to choose from. It's great that they opened up in Franklinton though, and if they can keep steady business, they'll be a great addition to the neighborhood."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is my forth time here.

Although I wish they would cut back on the food coloring. \\n\\n- Chicken 65 is known for its flavor and crunchiness. 65 flavors are mixed to present to you the perfect combination of taste. It's deep fried and is very filling. Zyka is known to have one of the best chicken 65 in town. Dish comes with 15 - 20 pieces/chunks of chicken. Also comes with two chutneys (dipping sauce)\\n\\n- Nehari - it has beef meat in it. Liquid saucy with 2/3 pieces of larger chunks of meat. This is one of the traditional items that can be salty/spicy/good flavor of ginger in it. I am not a fan of this item but it's a decently popular dish amongst others. \\n\\n- samosas - it's a vegetarian dish. Filled with peas, potatoes and a combination of other veggies wrapped in a dough. Deep fried. It's considered to be a street food. I love Indian street food. Don't expect it to be healthy but it tastes really good. These samosas are OKAY. It has a strong taste of Indian flavors. Can be very filling. Order comes with two pieces. Also comes with two chutneys (dipping sauce)\\n\\n- chicken tandoori- one piece of leg and thigh. Dipped in butter (ghee) and well marinated in spice. Then roasted in a traditional tandoori oven. It's soft and juicy. This is one of my fave. Also comes with chutneys (dipping sauce). \\n\\n- naan - it's soft and you can see the glossy layer of butter in top. It can get hard so I recommend ordering 1 to begin with (it's also very filling so you might not need a second one) and order extras later. However they get very busy so your order might take time. Find your right balance I suppose. \\n\\n- mango lassi- it's very sweet and thick (cause they add yogurt). But feels refreshing with this type of a meal. Expect to feel very full and heavy after a session at Zyka. \\n\\nSome things to note, their butter chicken is good. But it's got too much sauce and not enough meat. Achar gosht is usually what I order. It's goat meet slow cooked in this spicy sauce. It's DELICIOUS. I tried their biryani and it's okay. Also biryani has more rice and not enough meat. Mutha paratha is also a traditional bread and I prefer that over naan. \\n\\nAll in all, expect your taste buds to have a party. It's Indian food after all. Expect long lines (except on week nights like Wednesday's). They are great about managing parking.

I drive up to the drive-thru at 11:04 am, the lights on the restaurant stating it was open. I sat at the drive-thru almost 5 minutes, with no response. I got tired of waiting so I drove to the front and walked into the building. When I asked the guy at the counter, he told me that he had been too busy to answer the drive-thru. Wow! He could have at least acknowledge me and ask me to wait...\\nI ordered a 1/2 lb gizzards, gyro with no onion, and lightly seasoned fries. I paid my bill and waited. On my way out with my order, I asked for a packet of black pepper, in which he handed me a folded menu instead. I had to ask three times and request salt AND pepper for him to understand what I was asking for. I took my meal to work. Trying to eat it, I found that the gizzards were actually just tiny gizzards tips with a lot of crispy batter around them, so it had no taste. I opened the gyro to find that it had purple onion slices on it, even after asking for NO ONION! I am highly allergic to raw onion, so I had to throw the whole sandwich away - waste of money! The \\"lightly seasoned\\" fries I asked for, had so much salt and seasoning, that I couldn't eat them and had to throw them out also. Now I'm out $12 and still haven't eaten!

Blueberry Bourbon Basil??? Passionfruit Cocoa Nib?!?!?! Our group of 5 ordered these and a couple others, and we split them all up equally so that each of us could try all of the ones that we got. I don't think I've ever been so excited to try donuts before, and the uniqueness of the flavors definitely contributed to my excitement.\\n\\nBlueberry Bourbon Basil - This seems to be their flagship donut, and to be quite honest I was disappointed by it. It was somehow pretty flavorful while still not delivering on the hype. How is this possible? Well to put it quite bluntly, the flavors just didn't really work out for me. To me the donut seems a bit contrived, like they were working a little too hard to mix three random flavors that begin with the letter \\"B\\" together.\\n\\nPassionfruit Cocoa Nib - Again, this donut was robust in each of the flavors it promised, but was ultimately disappointing because those flavors weren't necessarily harmonious with each other.\\n\\nPB&J - Didn't really taste the PB in this one. The J was very jelly-ey though and added a pleasant gooey texture. Contrary to the impression I must be leaving with the other donuts, this one was rather inadequate in the depths of its flavors, including both the PB and the J. Despite that, I still really liked this one. If only the flavors had been more developed or pronounced, this would have been a home run!\\n\\nCr√®me Br√ªl√©e - I don't remember this one very well. It wasn't very memorable and probably was kind of bland...\\n\\nOverall, I unfortunately didn't really enjoy many of their donuts. Either I felt like the donut was flavorful but the mixture of flavors didn't work out for me, or the donut somehow was bland and did not have enough flavor. Perhaps I'm underestimating the difficulty in bringing such flavorfulness into donut form, but nevertheless I was very disappointed because of how much promise each donut seemed to have prior to tasting them. Despite all this, I would still definitely go again if I had the chance. They seem to rotate the different donuts available quite frequently, and I know I would still be excited to come back if they invented some other peculiar flavor combination or attempted to convert some other interesting dessert dish into a donut. Definitely come here and try this place out if you like trying new things and interesting flavor combinations!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"3325 SE Division St, Ste 1","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Anything can be solved with a donut.\\n\\nI have been hearing about these donuts for over a year now + finally sought them out.

Unfortunately, this is where it started to go wrong.  One way to sum this dish up is that it should NOT be described as a crudo.  It was so heavily seasoned and salty to the point that we couldn't really taste the fish.  Adding on, we also ordered a couple bar type items - the Crab French fries and Smoked Whitefish pizza and again, similar to the Tuna Crudo, it was very salty.   \\n\\nThe octopus was fairly better but on the broader end of having had octopus in many other places, we weren't super impressed.  Near the end, we didn't feel satisfied with what we ordered and decided to throw in an order of the Hiramasa Crudo and the Uni & Caviar toast which, amen, was completely redeeming.  This crudo was fresh, light and absolutely delicious; Everything you'd expect a good crudo to be.

It was cold and went down smooth.  \\n\\nI ordered their Boneless Wings (medium size order) with the Honey BBQ.    The sauce was tasty with a medium heat to it.   The wings ... I should have ordered something else.   They were more breading than actual wings.  In fact, they were more like overly breaded chicken pieces than boneless wings.  I saw others with the regular wings.   They looked meatier and better than their boneless version.   The medium size order had about 15 pieces in it.   Have to say my hunger was still not satisfied from it.   \\n\\nSo, I ordered one of their promotion specials, Oktoberfest Beer Cheese Dippers.   This came with tortilla chips, (like you get out of a bag), \\"salt & vinegar\\" kettle chips, (that had not salt & vinegar and were undercooked), and chipotle bbq pretzel bites which were fairly decent with a little kick.   Their \\"tangy cheddar dip made with Samuel Adams Ocktoberfest\\" had not tang and wasn't quite sure it was even cheddar.

I have a dairy sensitivity, and finding a dairy alternative ice cream that has great flavor and texture is not an easy feat.  NadaMoo has amazing flavor and is actually VERY CREAMY!!  Even my husband liked it.  It is hard to believe that NadaMoo is made from organic free, dairy free, coconut milk!  It was easy to find NadaMoo in our local grocery stores, but having a fresh scoop of ice cream in a waffle cone, is a different experience than a spoonful from a frozen carton.  I have been wishing they had a local brick and mortar for some time.  When I heard about their south Austin location I jumped for joy! Christmas came early this year!  I have been several times now.  If they were closer. I would go more.  The location is ADORABLE!  The outside of the building is even worth a snapshot with its live size sprinkles.  The inside harkens back to the old ice cream parlor but has modern touches.  I love the tucked away side seating areas.  A great way to use the small space.  The parking is narrow and limited. I usually park on the side streets and walk in.  They will let you sample some flavors to help you choose.  The staff are always patient, friendly, and informative. It's not easy as they have experimental flavors that you can only get in the shop.  You can order scoops of ice cream, coffee floats, or milkshakes.  They even gluten-free waffle cones that are INCREDIBLE and don't fall apart!  I love the pistachio nut and smores flavors.  \\n\\nBecause their ingredients are so clean, the sugar content is lower than most ice creams.

It's small, but, it packs a nice punch and is actually located off Main St in Buda.  This puts it just moments from  Kyle, or, as I like to say, \\"Just a skirt up the highway\\".   Currently they are closed on Sundays, so, I've made this a routine Saturday lunch.  Schedule permitting of course.\\n\\nI've tried several of their dishes and so far the Golden Noodles with Beef is my favorite dish.  So far.  I said.  So far.  That could easily change on my next Saturday outing.  Let me tell you about that Golden Noodles dish.  It is hot & spicy stir fried flat rice noodles with broccoli, egg, onion, bell pepper, carrots and Thai basil, in red and yellow curry sauce, and brown sauce and choice of meat.  I chose beef for the meat.  The dish really stood out with multiple flavors that you expect in a good Thai dish.  I was impressed with the beef as there was a generous amount AND it was not over cooked.  Excellent dish.\\n\\nI've also tried the Pad Thai.  I got this one with chicken and was left unimpressed.  The dish was a little too sweet for my liking and the chicken was over cooked and dry.  Meh.  Another dish I tried was the Green Curry Fried Rice.  I got this dish to go and it was a major fail.  Would never do it again.  It was a soggy gummy fail.  Maybe it would have been better eaten fresh instead of getting it as a take out.\\n\\nThe Pad Kee Mao is another win win.  It's a medium spicy stir fried flat rice noodles dish with mushrooms, Thai chili, fresh basil, tomatoes, bell peppers and choice of meat.  I like a lot of spice in my Thai food so this dish as is, is not near spicy enough.  So if you're like me, ask for extra spicy and I recommend beef or fresh tofu to be paired with this one.  As I dance through their menu I'll post my journey like I normally do, through the lens of my stupid smartphone.  Hope you enjoy following me on my journey at Im Thai.\\n\\nWhen in Kyle.................."},{"name":"BRU Burger Bar-Westerville","address":"691 North Cleveland Ave","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Place is great!

We waited for 30 minutes for our food. Finally a manager came by our table, and without making eye contact with any of us or apologizing, snatched our receipt off the table and read it and said to an employee next to her, \\"This is them, I found them.\\" Then she left. All without saying a word to us or apologizing that we have been waiting for 30 minutes. When our food came on the cart, my heart sank. Yes, indeed, our food had clearly been sitting out for some time because all of our fries were stale and cold. There were 4 of us and two of us got roast beef sandwiches and two got the ham and cheese sandwiches. All four of the sandwiches were cold and disappointing. We were given our food without so much of an apology or even a, \\"can I get you anything else?\\" or any typical courtesies given at restaurants. I thought about complaining but clearly even the manager doesn't care. \\nIf you have to eat lunch at Magic Kingdom I'd recommend any other quick service place. Pinocchio's, I think it's called, has decent pizza, and there's a good one also near Pirates of the Caribbean. Disney generally has pretty pitiful food at their quick service places, and that includes Be Our Guest, unfortunately. I think the best dinner places in WDW are at Hollywood Studios - Prime Time, the Italian place, and the Brown Derby. Sci Fi Diner is really cool and has good burgers.

The server greeted us and was polite, but very straight faced and quick to get down to business. \\n\\nWe were given a complimentary noodle soup.  It tasted vegetal based and had macaroni noodles; nothing amazing, but it was free.  I had always wanted to try menudo, and had no doubts that I would get an authentic version here.  I also ordered a buche taco which is one of my favorite tacos from their truck.  The menudo was definitely unlike anything I had before.  It came out in a large bowl with spicy red broth and oil globules floating on top.  I could tell from the first whiff that it was intestinal.  There was a generous amount of beef stomach and tripe,  but nothing else besides broth and meat.  It came with lime, diced onions, cilantro,  a few soft corn taco shells, and hot pepper seed  that I made little menudo tacos out of.  It wasn't quite as spicy as it looked.  I really enjoyed it, but I would probably split a bowl with someone in the future as it probably contains an insane amount of cholesterol. \\n\\nI love that I can try such different things here and that it is likely to be very similar to how it's eaten south of the border.  If that interests you this restaurant should be high on your list.

Roasted corn - as in truly roasted corn - cut fresh off the cob to make a salad or juicy beef tenderloin in a slightly sweet sauce? Lavender biscuits are unique yet refreshing, and the appetizers? Oh dear. They better be glad I was limited to one or I'd have taken the entire tray of  cornbread with bbq pork.\\n\\nLunch isn't bad at all either. Their sandwiches are hearty and packed full of goodies between two fresh slices of bread. The chicken salad was my choice and oh wow, blown away by all the flavors that worked so well together.

Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the wine and answered all of our questions, which is always enjoyable for us. \\n\\nSix of the eight food courses were fantastic, really wonderful, creative, and flavorful. There were two courses, however, that were seafood, and they were so terrible. We asked when the seafood had been caught, and the server told us three days ago, so that may be why those courses were so bad. When we mentioned this to the server, he kindly removed those courses from our bill, even though we didn't ask him to. \\n\\nWe left paying the same amount as what we have spent on three Michelin star rated restaurants, and I did not think that this was at the same level as those restaurants. The first reason being that, while the waitstaff were very kind, we weren't left alone a lot, so the service felt crowded. The second reason being that the execution of the service wasn't spot on like you get at a three Michelin star place. For that price, I expect pretty close to perfection. And the third reason, of course, was the freshness of the seafood. If you're going to serve seafood in Colorado, then you need to be confident in it.\\n\\nIf I ever go back, which I'm sure I will, in order to ensure I get the best value, I will not order a full tasting menu.

It was subtle and did not over power the sandwich.  The bratwurst is sliced longways and grilled.  It was white in color.  So, I was pretty happy knowing I got what I wanted.  \\n\\nMy husband got a burger and fries.  I picked off about 5 of his fries and they were crispy on the outside but soft and potatoey on the inside.  I was glad I got the broccoli instead of the fries because it offset the big sub bun.\\n\\nThey add a garnish of home made pickles.  They look like bread and butter pickles but they are something else.  Maybe a garlic pickle?  They are not sweet but they are not overwhelmingly dill flavored.  \\n\\nI scarfed down the sandwich; even eating the entire bun which I never do.\\n\\nWish we had a Barley's in my neck of the woods in Southern Ohio.

With the new addition of pizza during the lunch hour and for takeout last week, and upcoming additions to the menu in the next few weeks, this place is only looking to get better.  I would particularly focus on seafood dishes here, as it is always fresh and from a value perspective, incredibly hard to beat.

First of all, Mark K and I had some really great service from Archana.  She was so pleasant and helpful the entire time we were there.  She was kind enough to bring out the chef to answer some of the questions that we had about Indian cuisine.  Now the fact that the food is amazingly good and the fact that they have a full bar featuring some hard to find Indian beer really just rounded out an impressive dining experience.\\n\\nTheir lunch buffet but it wasn't set up that day.  I'm not sure why but as it turned out, we were able to enjoy more of a true Indian dining experience by ordering several small plates and sharing.  Dish after dish of appealing, savory food came out to our table.  We kept commenting on how good everything was and with that warm fresh Naan on the side for a delicious palette cleanser, we couldn't ask for anything more.\\n\\nSince it was Mark's second visit he did an updated review and took them from 4 to 5 stars.  I also saw that Pat E. was there recently and she also gave them 5 stars.  2 trusted reviewers said 5 stars?  I'm totally in agreement.  If you like Indian food, I'm sure you'll be pleased with Awadh.\\n\\nAnd\\nA\\nLittle\\nMore\\nFood\\nFor \\nThought:\\n\\n** Update:  Ryan S. and I went for dinner 7-16-19 and we were every bit as impressed with the food and the service.  It was stellar!\\n\\n* Papadum - This is an Indian cracker/chip that Awadh hands out complimentary to everyone.  Comes out with a tamarind and a chutney dipping sauce.\\n\\n* Indian Beer - It's not easy to find Indian beer in Columbus but Awadh has both Flying Horse and Taj Mahal.  These imports come in 22 ounce bottles and are a very good deal for $6.  FH is a little lighter - crisper lager and TM is a more full bodied lager.  Both are very good and go well with the spices in Indian food.\\n\\n* Naan - Both the Butter and the Garlic versions are fresh, soft and delicious.  Just $1.99 gets you a large flat of this great palate cleanser.\\n\\n* Lehsuni Gobi - An Indo-Chinese fusion dish of cauliflower that's lightly battered and deep fried and then tossed in a medium spicy soy / garlic sauce. It's absolutely delicious.\\n\\n* Dry Chili Chicken / Chicken 65 - Another Indo-Chinese fusion dish.  This was very different from the other C65's I've had elsewhere being a little more saucy and spicy than I've found elsewhere.  It absolutely phenomenal.\\n\\n* Chicken Tikka - Delicious chunks of marinated white chicken meat in a creamy light tomato sauce.\\n\\n* Murgh Makhani aka Butter Chicken is a Northern Indian dish, the most popular dish in India for that matter and it comes with a generous portion of chicken chunks in a velvety, buttery tomato sauce.\\n\\n* Chettinad Chicken is a delicious Southern Indian curry dish.  Like their Butter Chicken, it has plenty of chicken but the curry gravy is slightly more spicy - flavorful.\\n\\n* Pan Fried Spicy Paneer - Paneer is a tasty firm cheese that's fried and browned.  They are soft and flavorful when hot but once they cool down...  Take my word and eat these asap.\\n\\n* Gulabjamun - This is the sweetest dessert on their menu according to our server.  It's two balls of dough sitting in a dish of simple syrup.

What a fantastic meal!!!  I am an adventurous eater as is my wife and 12 year old daughter so we were delighted with all the offerings on this buffet.  The dishes, and flavors, ranged from all over Africa.  Many dishes I was familiar with, while I was introduced to some new ones that have become new favorites that I will now have to learn how to make at home.  Like all Disney restaurants, this place isn't cheap, but overall I felt that it was worth it, at Disney (any other time I would consider this to be slightly overpriced, although not overly so). I do think that picky eaters would have a hard time here.  They do have a few standards, mainly kid type foods, but most of the food was on the exotic side.  My only complaint is that the way the buffet is set up a long line forms by the carving station, and it can take a while to make your way through.  They really should set it up so that there are 2 carving stations.  That may seem to be kind of nit-picky but that long line often meant that only half our group as at the table, eating, at any given time, and that seems a little excessive.

We were on our way out of Portland, so we stopped by this Southeast location, as it was a lot closer to where we were staying. The smells, upon entering, are intoxicating. I've mentioned before that I definitely prefer savory to sweet. After coming here, it has made me re-think my stance on savory vs. sweet foods. As previously mentioned, the locals feel the same way too, and you can tell, because they often sell out before their official closing hours. And I mean, ALL of their doughnuts sell out. You gotta think that's much more impressive than the cronuts that come in a limited supply at Dominique Ansel in New York.\\n\\nFirst thing I have to mention: raspberry thyme and blueberry bourbon basil doughnuts. Order them now. The raspberry thyme was more of a cake doughnut, and had a crispy outside and a moist cakey inside. And that glaze. There ain't anything like it. The blueberry bourbon basil doughnut was a bit more complex in flavor, and more like a regular, fluffy doughnut. Hoo-wee. We also tried the Meyer lemon curd-filled powdered doughnut, and the chocolate crunch doughnuts, which were excellent as well, and just so unique.\\n\\nThe staff behind the counter were very patient with us as we asked for their personal favorites, as well as the \\"signature\\" doughnuts. They mentioned that there were definitely favorites, but that we should try as much as we could, and that we wouldn't regret it. We got about a dozen doughnuts, and we did not regret it. The prices are very expensive, at about $3+ per doughnut. There ain't no way around it, so it's just that decision on whether or not you think it's worth it. However, you can be assured that the quality will be there, and that Blue Star is constantly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity. \\n\\nThe doughnuts are excellent, the staff is friendly and efficient, and while the prices aren't ideal, you can be assured that this is the best doughnut you'll get in Oregon, and even quite possibly the country.

It's inconspicuously positioned in the parking lot of Trader Joe's in good ole SE PDX. Thank God I found it. \\n\\nI got the pulled pork with coleslaw and DAMN, it was delicious. I got it with the mid sauce because I'm a big baby but you can opt for medium or hot (I've been told by my co-worker that their hot is indeed 'hot' so...there's that). The mild sauce is tangy & sweet for me. They also have your typical sides of coleslaw, BBQ beans 'n' such. \\n\\nIt seems to be steadily popular but you get your food quick!

To begin at the beginning, the dinner rolls were very good.  The second time I went, I got adventurous and tried the molasses-flavored bread, and I could not believe how great the flavor was as soon as I took the first bite.  Out of a tremendous sense of friendship, I let my friend have the second piece, and she was pleasantly surprised as well.  \\n\\nMoving on to the main course, I had the short rib the first time I went, which was good, and was surrounded by exceptionally good mashed potatoes, of which I am not normally a fan, but became a convert after having had them there.  \\n\\nOn the second occasion, the pork loin dinner I had blew away anything I can ever remember eating when I lived in the Cambridge area, and was on par with some of the best places I've ever been.  To begin with, I was impressed that the pork loin was cooked perfectly (I had mine more medium rare than my friend, who opted for the safer choice of medium).  The meat was juicy, which is sometimes not the case with pork, and had a wonderful flavor that was accented with fantastic cheddar grits, which were also cooked just right, and Brussels sprouts.  It was an exceptional presentation, and I truly enjoyed every bite.  I shamelessly cleaned my plate as best as I could do without resorting to abandoning my fork and knife, and even with the impairment of utensils, nearly didn't waste a drop.  \\n\\nFor dessert, the second time I went, we had an insanely good chocolate fondue, with fresh fruit and delicious pieces of chocolate and vanilla cake.  Cake is another item of which I am not a big fan in most cases, but they nailed the flavor without going overboard, and it was amazing.\\n\\nWith regard to the service, the second time I went, it was exceptional.  As my friend described it, the experience was \\"flawless.\\"  Our waiter was professional, was attentive without being invasive, and treated us in a respectful and yet still friendly manner.  I had previously had a negative experience the first time around and had made management aware of it.  I received an almost immediate response to my complaint at the time, and was very impressed with the professionalism with which Christina, the General Manager, directly addressed the situation and persuaded me to give this place another shot.  I had a real sense that my opinion mattered, and I am so glad I tried the restaurant a second time.  In addition to the fact that I already felt the food was good the first time around, my experience with management and with the first class service the second time around sealed the deal on my positive review."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"For Disney dining, rbis place is pretty on point. \\n\\nWe met some fsmily for a late lunch and were seating pretty quickly. \\n\\nThe menu options were abundant enough and the ingredients were of high quality \\n\\nI ordered the spicy sausage pizza (I wish it was a little bit spicier) and the fresh mozzarella and crust was delish.

I picked up burgers and fries to take home. I live approximately 1 1/2 miles from the this location. Everything was stone cold when I got home, and the burger didn't have the jalape√±os or grilled onions I ordered. It must have been cold when I got it, but I didn't check the bag. That is my mistake, but the biggest mistake was going to this location. Hopefully this is just a poor reflection on the this store, and not the new trend due to Whataburger being sold to a Chicago based company :("},{"name":"Pho Paris","address":"136 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"I had seen Pho Paris several times, but hadn't had the opportunity to visit until recently. I went at exactly 11 on a Saturday, but believe they open at 10:30, which is even better. Staff is super friendly. There are plenty of tables; parking is a bit tough though. Due to my timing, I did not have a problem parking.\\n\\nBelieve it or not, this was my first time having beef pho. I'm more of pho ga girl, ya feel me? But this was great. The flank was flavorful and the bowl was huge. I was a bit disappointed in the aromatics, as the menu listed sawtooth (culantro) which is hard to find. So I had hope, because I'm a huge sawtooth fan, but they just offered the usual. Goi cuon was fine.

The decor within the restaurant is everything you would imagine and it feels like you are actually in the movie. My wife and I had our first breakfast at Disney world here and it was not that bad.\\n\\nFor breakfast I had the egg whites with chicken sausage and fruits while my wife had Sausage, bacon, potatoes and eggs. Everything was good except both sausages. They felt very dry and almost like a jerky texture which was unappetizing. The eggs were perfect for both of us and it was the highlight of our break fast. They also provide free pastries which they say is a gift from us to you but everybody gets it and most of them taste stale.\\n\\nIf I could change one thing other than the sausage during our experience it's to have an actual dining experience instead of ordering up at the front and having someone come deliver your food and that be the end of it. Be our guest has the opportunity to become e great dining experience but it seems like a cheap quick service which sort of ruins the dining experience. \\n\\nI still think everyone should experience this restaurant but do not get your hopes up."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"WOWW!!!!!\\n\\nMy favorite Indian restaurant of all time.
