And as I dug into the last one, I thought it tasted funny.  Kinda herby.  So I tried it again and it was just plain disgusting.  Turns out it was some like basil vanilla.

The tone was accusatory like we were trying to pull something over on him by TRYING TO DINE AT THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD A CONFIRMED RESERVATION. \\n\\nWe explained that we had called and even received a text confirmation. He jumped all over that excuse and started blaming Reezy. We had to explain repeatedly that we didn't book online. \\n\\nThis is the point where good hospitality would mean saying \\"I am so terribly sorry for our mistake. We would be happy to accommodate your party tomorrow night for dinner.\\"  Or \\"I'm so sorry. can we cover your transportation tonight and offer a recommendation on another option?\\" Instead he went with a condescending \\"Well I don't know how that all happened but there are no reservations tonight.\\" When pressed, he finally offered a free round of drinks. \\n\\nWhen we asked about a future reservation he said, \\"I would have to check.\\" Are you kidding me!? Basic hospitality 101 is to say \\"Of course. What time should we expect you?\\" \\n\\nAll of that was bad enough, but then we found out he told the third car a completely different story. He denied any conversation of a reservation. \\n\\nThis is a beautiful venue but in a crowded restaurant-rich city, hospitality matters. Tone matters. Attitude matters.

The night we went, we saw Heather F. and Amy D. just as they were finishing up their meal, and then we joined Suzie and Jens for a couple beers after we ate. I feel like there should be an official stat for this place, like \\"Every four minutes, a Yelper checks into Barlata.\\" It's truly the restaurant du jour. \\n\\nWe actually didn't order a ton of food, as one is apt to do at tapas, perhaps because at 8-10 a plate, it can get pricey FAST if you go crazy here, and because it was just two of us. There were tons of things on the menu that appealed, and we ended up going with the tortilla espagnola, the mixed seasonal veggies, and the vegetarian paella (we ordered a small, they accidentally sent a large. Score.) \\n\\nThe veggies were delicious, though soaked in oil. It's to be expected with Spanish fare, but next time, I think I'd search for a vegetable dish that's a little less heavy, perhaps something grilled (the Swiss Chard \\"Catalana\\" looked interesting). If I'm going to eat copious amounts of oil, I'd probably just prefer to go with something potato based or bread-coated, to be honest. The tortilla espagnola was fantastic - it's like a hash of eggs, potato, and onion. There's another vegetarian tortilla on the menu, which has spinach and manchego cheese that I think we'll try next time - it sounds delicious. \\n\\nThe vegetarian paella was really flavorful and they didn't skimp on the mixed veggies, which I appreciated. It was most definitely not the best paella I've had, but honestly, I think that was more due to the lack of meat... meat and meat stock really does amp up the flavor of paella quite a bit. However, this is a paella that I would eat more frequently, because it's less heavy and at least *tastes* a lot more healthful than its meaty counterparts.\\n\\nYou also get bread and olive tapenade to start, and they keep refilling it throughout the meal - I thought this was great, and thank god they slice the bread very thin, because it'd be easy to fill up on that alone... then again, I could happily make a meal of bread and olives and skip the rest of the food all together.\\n\\nThe portions were just right for two of us, though we did finish off the large paella, so I wonder if a small would have been enough, given we only had 2 tapas plates. All of that, with no alcohol and a saffron ice cream shared for dessert (I was skeptical of that flavor choice, but it was very nice and refreshing), came to $40... not bad at all, but if you're enjoying wine and really wanting to get into sampling the food, the bill will shoot into the hundreds pretty fast, I'd imagine. Plus, we ate all vegetarian, which is always cheaper. \\n\\nOur evening ended with us sitting at the communal table near the bar with some great people, enjoying a couple delicious Estrella Damms and good conversation. I think that's the biggest selling point for Barlata - It's great for both a more intimate dinner with a date, or for a group of friends to eat and share communal style. I'd imagine it's even a great place to come alone. Sit at the bar, have a couple of small plates and a beer or a glass of Spanish wine, and I imagine you'll find yourself in conversation with someone sooner rather than later. \\n\\nGorgeous restaurant, bustling and lively, convenient location, and what seemed to be a decent amount of parking... I can certainly understand the hype."},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Been to Maudie's a handful of times now, and really like it.

They also had menu options like lamb and crab burgers, which sounded interesting. The fries tasted and looked just like the fresh cut ones my mom makes. We also ordered what I think was the Buffalo Trail Cocktail. Neither of us enjoyed that very much. It was described as having citrus and cherry, but tasted pretty bland to us. Neither of us drink much, though, so maybe it was wonderful and we just don't know enough about liquors to properly recognize it's splendor. :)\\n\\nThe music was a bit too loud, which made conversation difficult, but I thought it was kind of neat that they had their own DJ. Never seen a restaurant that small with one before. :)\\n\\nThe staff were funny and very helpful, but the service was very slow, which is the only reason I didn't give this place five stars.

We had heard about this restaurant before, and wanted to try it out.\\n\\nWe came during the lunch hour, which meant lots, and lots of people.  Around the restaurant, there are electric boards that light up and show items from their menu.  \\n\\nThe menu here consists of typical Chinese and Hong Kong foods.  Xiao long bao, meat buns, stir fried rice cakes, vegetable dishes, animal organs, and all types of other yummy snacks.  \\n\\nWhile we were here, we enjoyed typical China restaurant treatment.  It was loud, bustling, and frantic.  Not bad, pretty interesting experience actually.\\n\\nBack to the food, we ordered: pork xiao long bao, pan fried meat buns, animal organs, Shanghai styled rice cakes, and their special drunken chicken.\\n\\nThe pork xiao long bao had a thin outer dough, with a nice and juicy filling.  The pork was perfectly spiced, and it wasn't just mush.  A good spoonful of ground pork.  The soup was piping hot, and there was just the right amount of it.  The pork wasn't drowning in it, nor was there just a single drop.  I actually think it was better than some of the xiao long bao I've had in Taiwan.\\n\\nThe pan fried meat buns were my favorite!  Crispy bottoms, and a soft and fluffy outer dough.  The filling was spiced just right, like the xiao long bao.  The green onions and sesame seed garnish made it awesome. \\n\\nThe animal organs were my next favorite, each piece was a different part of a different animal.  Slightly spicy, kind of addicting, savory, and yummy!\\n\\nShanghai styled rice cakes were some of the most delicious I have ever tasted.  A little bit on the salty side, but not overboard.  I like the veggies, and little pieces of meat throughout the dish.  The rice cakes were cooked nicely, and al dente.\\n\\nThe drunken chicken's sauce was amazing, and like nothing I've had before.

Is that annoying?\\nAnyway, my previous favorite breakfast spot on planet earth was The Pork Store on Haight in San Francisco. They serve this amazing (and surprisingly, given the name) excellent veggie scramble called the Scralifornia which is made with fresh salsa and avocado and served with biscuits with rosemary gravy and....oh, wait, I'm reviewing Tin Shed. I digress.\\n\\nI'm pleased to announce that Tin Shed's menu rivals The Pork Store's. They have veggie gravy! And rich and powerful vegetarian breakfasts, with various textures and flavors. The names of the dishes are creative so it's hard for me to recall them. Get something with a scramble and veg gravy and you'll enjoy it. \\nYou drink coffee while you wait for a table, from funny little funky mugs, and you look on while scarfed and wool-hatted mates sit on the cold patio beneath heat lamps. It's so...well, Pacific Northwest, I guess. It's what I pictured funky breakfast joints in Portland to look and feel like before I got here. It's quintessential hip PDX breakfast spot for me. Crowded, eclectic, and understated in a devil-may-care sort of way.\\n\\nService is professional, quick. Bloody marys are fun to quaff after a night of partying, although entirely too weak for my liking.\\n\\nIn closing, I'm a fan of Tin Shed.

This is basically where any superlatives regarding Main Event Entertainment come to an end.\\n\\nParking is a nightmare.\\n\\nI've added two enters after the statement, so that it could stand alone, to sort of give emphasis to just how bad that such a statement is, because it's really, really bad.\\n\\nThink Black Friday + Murder Kroger on the day before Thanksgiving kind of bad.  \\n\\nWhen I arrived, there was absolutely nowhere to park.  My friends in group text had already whined about how there was absolutely nowhere to park.  It took me 20 minutes to get lucky enough to find someone leaving before anyone else could see it to park.  Mind you, this is a two-story parking deck, but it's also shared with a Taco Mac and the AMC theater itself, but the vast majority of people, either they're first timers like myself, or simply don't know better, are there for Main Event.\\n\\nEntering Main Event Entertainment is basically like walking into a nightmare.  I've never seen such a business that has gone to so much effort to smash together so many genres, niches and operations into one structure, yet it seems to accomplish getting people in the door (at least once).\\n\\nBut part of the reason I say it's a nightmare, because it's so neatly compartmentalized, yet all visible simultaneously at any given angle.  Seriously, from the main entrance, it's cosmic bowling to your left, the seedy pool hall to your immediate right, the cast of that Terrence Howard FOX show (Empire?) all crowding the bar, adjacent to the pool tables, and then the equivalent of a Chuck E. Cheese's right behind the main counter.\\n\\nAnd to top it all off, the latter \\"compartment\\" of Main Event is what brings to the table, the most baffling of all ingredients for an unnerving time to the table: kids.\\n\\nI have nothing wrong with kids, and I'm probably too far gone in coming off as one of those snarky reviewers who are anti-kids.  But the fact of the matter is that in the grand spectrum of what Main Event is trying to be, kids, are kind of the outlier, the thing that probably shouldn't be around in the equation.  Yet they are.\\n\\nWhile you have people getting plowed on $7 beers at the bar, eating bar food, and drinking more $7 beers at the tables scattered around the place, you've got kids running around everywhere, unsupervised (naturally), amongst the grown up people there to party, flirt, hook up, and generally engage in more grown up activities.\\n\\nI think what I'm trying to say is that Main Event Entertainment has a confusion in target audience, and as a result of that, you've got a hundred kids running around a club while the Real Housewives of Atlanta and their posses are milling about.\\n\\nGetting back to more review-like things, service at Main Event Entertainment is about as good as you'd expect it, if you've read this far, which is to say that it too, was also a nightmare.  To cut to the chase, the entire establishment is criminally understaffed.  From what I heard, several employees walked out on the particular night I was there, which is unfortunate, but the fact of the matter is that I could surmise like, 5-6 servers who were literally in charge of the entire place.  Most of my friends went hungry, drinks went missing repeatedly, and then there are people like me, who relegated ourselves to going to the bar ourselves.\\n\\nWhich was an experience in itself, because if you're able to squeeze past the bros with do-rags on and sunglasses on at night, you still actually have to get the attention of one of the bartenders, whom might grace you with service if you're lucky.  And if you're lucky, then you might have the privilege of paying for an exorbitantly priced alcoholic beverage.  But seriously, the bartenders repeatedly hid behind the back of the bar, where they'd chat and mill about when there's people practically begging to give them money.\\n\\nThe arcade within the Chuck E. Cheese portion is an absolute joke.  It's not entirely the business' fault that video gaming is in the state it is now, but basically if you want to play crap on your phone like Flappy Bird or Fruit Ninja, but on large screens with echo-ey speakers, Main Event is where to find them.\\n\\nOops, character limit.

They're not huge sushi people, so the waitress carefully recommended rolls she thought they might like. When my sister-in-law didn't like one of them, she brought her a less spicy version for free.

The waitress showed up as we ate our salad. We got our bowl and headed over to get our stir fry ingredients. There were no containers for the sauces so we waited as people grabbed the last of the soup bowls for their sauces. When we did get our sauces, we headed to the grill where there were two very genial cooks. Sadly, they had no protection from the hot utensils they used to flip the food, so I watched them burn themselves multiple times. I also watched them add sauce to the wrong meal. Then they left mine on the grill while my husband and I waited for them to wash their hands. Both our meals were burned, but I got about three extra minutes of burn added to mine. There wasn't enough sauce I could add to cover the taste. It was not worth the time or money. The staff was generally nice, but they were manning a sinking ship.

The velveeta cheese prompted some fun poking....as we weren't sure whether it was cheese or \\"processed cheese product\\".....the tortillas were probably from around the corner at Randalls....and if you want a margarita or mixed drink....just order beer. Their mixes....when you CAN get a drink without a major hassle, are weak.\\n\\nThe service is sub par and the waiters don't tend to speak English very well. At least, not the day shift.  Which is fine...if you're at a smaller Mexican restaurant that isn't serving you Velveeta. Also, better get all your ordering done right away, because you wont be seeing that server for a long time afterward.\\n\\nMy two experiences there were just not very good.

Dudh soda was too sweet but good for kids. Masala mojito was amazing . For appetizer we ordered veggie chicken and chaat. Chaat was good but really small amount for the money  you pay . Veggie chicken was literally the store bought veg chicken nuggets topped with cabbage and green pepper . They tasted and smelt exactly the same. Again this was a really small plate as well with barely six nuggets. For $16 you would think it should atleast be shareable between 5 ppl.. very disappointed in this item. For mains I ordered Amritsari kulcha plate  , dal makhani, tawa sabzi , garlic naan and laccha parantha. The chole in the kulcha plate were good but the kulcha in itself did not have a good tasting filling . I've had way better . Dal makhani was disappointing and tasted like nothing but butter . Tawa sabzi was dry and had no tudka in it which is the main thing abt this dish .there was no flavour to it. Garlic naan were good. Laccha parantha was dry with butter thrown on top.

Rimsky is a coffee house located in a converted Victorian-style house, it's very eclectic with an unique decor and some people find it creepy.   There are painted faces camouflaged into the wallpaper.  The upstairs bathroom has a dummy in a raft that watches you pee, feet coming out of the ceiling, and hands as the toilet paper holder.  I guess it could be nerve-wrecking.  \\n\\nLast time I went when it just opened and they weren't quite ready for customers.  Even though we were the only ones there, it took a while to get our orders taken and drinks/desserts to come out.  I love the one waiter guy that works there, whose name I can't recall right now, he is funny and outgoing--he has been there for long time.  The space started filling up fast and the service got overwhelmed.  It might be more efficient to have more than one person taking and producing the orders.

There were about 6 people in line ahead of me, which is no problem usually. I observed 7 people behind the counter, with one employee in the line getting his dinner meal and joking around with the people behind the line. This is EXACTLY what happened the last time I had a bad experience there. No one was really on the ball. I ordered a carnitas bowl and a chicken burrito. \\n\\nFirst guy in line starts the bowl, sees there is no chicken - puts my tortilla on foil back where the guy is about to cut the chicken. It sits there while he sharpens the knife (directly over the pile of cooked chicken - nice!) then the bowl sits there while other orders are started. So I'm standing there watching them prep other burritos. There are little to no beans left. I watch a girl scoop out what amounts to water with a few beans on someone's burrito. Ugh.\\n\\nThen the chicken is finally cut, and attention returns to my order. A girl finishes the bowl, then drags my burrito across the prep counter - which is smeared with old guacamole, lettuce, and globs of \\"stuff\\". Sounds really delicious doesn't it?\\n\\nNow I'm starting to think this is pretty gross. My burrito is done, and she tries to roll it up into foil, and while doing so, pulls a bunch of lettuce up off the counter into my foil. Again, how gross is that?\\n\\nOK, I just want out of there at this point. It's backed up - no one seems to really care about expediting orders - it just makes you want to leave - and quick!\\n\\nI pay my $16.32 and leave - bag in hand.\\n\\nSo I get home, and decide I will simply make my own bowl out of my chicken burrito, as it looks pathetic. Get my wife situated, sit down and take a bite - and guess what?? It's STONE COLD. One would think if it had been cut while I stood there, the chicken might at least be WARM??? Nope. COLD as a ROCK.\\n\\nI'm a frequent diner at Chipotle, but this is pathetic. Sixteen bucks for food that's not only unappealing to look at - but awful to eat? Not going to happen. I'll spend my money elsewhere.\\n\\nIt used to be awesome. The manager was great. Looked out for his customers. Not any more.

Seriously, I dream about this damn salad. It's soooo much better than your typical \\"taco salad\\" that you get at most Tex-Mex places. Let me explain:\\n\\nFirst of all, no lame taco shell bowl. Those are stupid.\\n\\nSecond, the grilled onions and chicken add a TON of flavor to the salad. \\n\\nThird: They squirt lime juice on it, so it's got that citrus-y zing to it. That's right: I just used the word \\"zing.\\"\\n\\nFourth: I never get the dressings they offer to go on it. Instead, I put some of their yummy, spicy salsa on it. This is DEFINITELY the way to go. \\n\\nFifth: They do NOT skimp on the avocados, which is a wonderful treat. Avocados are one of my very favorite foods on the planet, so anything with lots of avocado-y goodness is aces in my book.\\n\\nSixth: This is truly a meal-sized salad. In fact, I can rarely finish it. But I always make sure I got every bit of chicken and avocado. Oh yes I do.\\n\\nAs someone who doesn't eat beef, there's not a ton of options on Maudie's menu besides the Maida's salad. But I could really care less since this thing is so fuh-reekin good.\\n\\nToday my lunchmate had the vegetarian tacos, and they looked like crap. Why? Because they were hard to eat (too slimy to pick up, to big to cut up) and the filling? Primarily bell peppers. Come ON Maudie's, you can get a wee more creative than that. Not surprisingly, he didn't really enjoy them, and said he'd be writing it down in his notebook to remind him to never order them again. I don't know if he actually HAS such a notebook, but it'd be pretty cool if he did.\\n\\nTheir margaritas and Mexican martinis are pretty damn yummy, and this Maudie's location offers a bunch of different kind of mojitos that sound awesome (although I've never actually ordered one).\\n\\nThe Hacienda can get WAY crowded and noisy during the lunch and dinner rushes, the parking is sometimes a bit of an issue, and the service can be a little less-than-stellar, but overall I give it four stars simply because this location means that the Maida's salad is that much closer to my front door."},{"name":"Johnnie Fox's Irish Snug","address":"1033 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great Irish bar to come and chat with friends.

It's a place where we felt peace of mind with our daughter's milk and egg allergies and my mother's gluten intolerance since they offer dairy free pizza options and gluten free crust options.  Today, however, my family and I were beyond disappointed, dissatisfied and devastated.  As we were ordering, we were informed that they were all out of the dairy free cheese and the gluten free crust.  We decided to order some pizzas, wings and salads anyway to feed our family members with no dietary and allergy issues and ended up buying my daughter, who was looking forward to a delicious dairy free pizza, food elsewhere and bringing it in to this restaurant.  My mother had to alter her order completely, unfortunately.  Needless to say, our daughter was beyond devastated since she is limited on food selections regularly everywhere else and was looking forward to eating the dairy free pizza she normally eats from here.  It imposed a huge inconvenience on us as we had to spend our precious family time traveling to get other food for the family members who have food allergies.  When our salad came out, I had to get up out of my seat to ask for plates and utensils I guess they expected all of us to eat with our hands.  And to top it off, they were out of wings too, which we were not informed of at all (we found out through the employees spewing secrets).   We only received half the order of wings when we were about done eating and I guess they expected us to wait how ever many more hours for our other order of wings.  We ended up asking to cancel that wing order that never arrived and asking for a refund.  It was just a horrible experience we had this time.  And quite frankly, were really surprised at the lack of service this time since our previous experience 6 months ago was exactly the opposite.  It sounds like their management needs desperate help.

I ordered the Maine lobster salad, which came with an unconscionable amount of shellfish for $11, but it might as well have been rubber for all its lack of nuance or flavor; I would have preferred a mug of butter to the mess of avocado it came with.  My two friends both ordered the steak tips, which arrived cooked two different ways, and while one entree came with whipped potatoes in a ceramic dish, the other came with fries in a throwaway takeout box.

I've been greeted upon arrival, and attended to immediately. The Daryl Hannah doppelganger (as previously mentioned) is almost worth the cost of the trip alone, she also makes a mean burrito! I did have some trouble understanding the person who built my burrito the last time I was there though. He did have a thick accent, but usually that's not a problem for me, he just needed to speak up, as I had to ask him to repeat himself several times.\\n\\nTo me, the burrito is the main attraction of Chipotle. So far I've tried the Chicken, Steak, and Barbacoa meat filling, and thus far the Chicken is my favorite. I thought the Steak didn't have a lot of flavor, and the Barbacoa was tasty, but a bit too spicy for my liking. You can choose your own filling including rice, beans (black or pinto), salsa, cheese, and sour cream. Their mild salsa is a pico de gallo (salsa fresca) and its basically chopped tomato, onion, and cilantro. I did try the hot salsa, but it was a little too hot for my tastes. They have other options such as tacos, salads, a burrito bowl (the entire burrito filling served in a bowl with no tortilla). For vegetarians they do also offer a veggie burrito with guacamole.\\n\\nChipotle's value may vary by customer. $6.25 for a chicken burrito is moderate, I know there are cheaper places, but none of them are less than a mile from where I work. I've had about 4-5 burritos there now, and they've been fairly consistent, but some of the employees make better ones than others (see: Daryl Hannah). Beyond that I don't think there is much value. Nothing comes with the burritos, so if you want chips & salsa, they charge $2.05. Granted, you don't technically need them with a burrito, they do help make it a meal. For fountain soda, it's another $1.90, so overall you're not getting out of there for less than ten dollars, which is expensive for a lunch.\\n\\nI don't understand why there are so many negative comments about the atmosphere. Upon walking in the place has a nice modern/minimalist d√©cor with a little Mexican culture thrown in here. This in comparison to the gaudy furnishings of some of some other restaurants, it's nice. Besides, I don't go to a restaurant to judge the art on the walls or the tiles on the floor. I would like to point out how much I love the music though. Most likely it's being pumped in from some satellite station, but kudos to whoever chose the station. One minute I'm hearing Radiohead, the next a bluegrass cover of Pink Floyd. For the most part the restaurant has been as clean as one can expect, both in the dining room and in the restroom, and the staff is presentable as well. They have an enclosed area to eat outdoors, which is a great option for those nice Massachusetts days.\\n\\nThe location is decent, formerly a Henry's Root Beer Stand (sadly, a failed endeavor) and prior to that most likely a bank or something, Chipotle is trying to capitalize on a great location on a busy road just down the street from several large office buildings, but in a really inconvenient spot. Taking a right out of that parking lot is hard enough; don't even think about trying to bang a left. The parking lot is small, but I've never seen it packed there, so unless they start giving food away I don't think this will be a problem.\\n\\nOverall I have been very pleased with Chipotle, and I will continue to visit. My only major complaint is the value/price, if they added a combo where you could get a burrito, chips, salsa, and a drink for like $8, I would be ecstatic."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Last Saturday I was craving pizza and beer.

The only caffeine-slinging joint open in our vicinity according to Yelp was this place, so we popped the address in our GPS and headed over there. Between the GPS and my cell phone map, we could not find this place and had to circle the block three times before we realized it was in the dark house on the opposite side of the road from where the two maps were telling us it was. We parked and headed inside, excited to check out a local coffee place before leaving town. \\n\\nThere were musicians playing, which was nice, and at first I didn't realize that there was no to-go counter hidden somewhere in the back of the house. We hadn't been planning on staying as we really needed to get on the road and simply wanted java to go. We decided to hit the bathroom before ordering, and well, I won't ruin the surprise for you if you haven't experienced it yet. Very cool...and creepy...is all I'll say. After we were downstairs and ready to caffeinate, we realized our error, but decided to stay because a) it was the only place open, and b) we wished there was a place like this in Seattle! \\n\\nWe picked out a table in the very crowded place (considering it was a Wednesday night) and the waitress took our order quite promptly. We both ordered a drink (orange mocha for him, a pot of tea for me) and a dessert (an ice cream sundae for me, apple strudel for him). The drinks came out in about five minutes. My tea pot was *scorching* hot. I actually burned my fingers while pouring tea into my cup. Please note that if you order tea, you should use the cloth napkin they provide to lift the lid off the pot and let some hot air out first so the pot cools down enough for you to actually enjoy your beverage without scalding your hands or tongue. \\n\\nFortunately, or unfortunately, I had plenty of time to sit and wait for the tea to cool down because after over 40 minutes of sitting there (according to my phone since I had facebooked about it when we sat down), our desserts still hadn't arrived-- nor had our waitress ever come back to check on us so we could remind her. Since we needed to get back home, we left cash on the table to cover our bill for the drinks and left. Though we found the place very charming in concept, we were ultimately quite disappointed with our experience there. I can't guarantee that I'd go back on a future trip to Portland, but if I do, I sure hope they get it together enough to actually serve us our entire order. I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could, but I'll be generous with three in the hopes that the kitchen staff was simply stoned to the point where it would make sense that heating up a piece of apple strudel and scooping some ice cream into a dish would take more than 40 minutes and that this won't be the case if there is a next time."},{"name":"La Casona Colombian Restaurant","address":"3820 Stewart Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love the food.

In the name, \\"Bar\\" comes before \\"Grill\\", meaning come here for a drink and when you get hungry, order some food. It will probably taste better if you do it that way too. The food isn't \\"bad\\" necessarily, it's just not memorable, nor is it worth the prices they charge without a coupon, so if you don't have one, having a few drinks before paying may help ease the pain when you get the bill. The Beer Can Chicken which I WAS able to get on my last visit (as that server told me they only make 4-6 per day?!?) was ok, I didn't taste much of the beer flavor though. The side of dirty rice was bland and the guac/salsa side was confusing. I guess because they used Dos Equis beer they felt the need for Mexican-style sides? I don't know.\\n\\nWhat I do know is that the wishbone I had managed to salvage from the chicken and set aside to take with me, disappeared. The story goes, if you dry it out for a few days, then find someone to pull the other end with, both of you make a wish and whoever gets the bigger piece when pulled has their wish granted. Anyway, the wishbone was apparently snatched off the table by the server, yet when asked if he took it, he acted confused and said he took \\"something\\" off the table and threw it away. Funny how he managed to miss a lot of trash still left on the table. When I asked about the wishbone, he said he would go check to see if he could get it out of the trash, but came back and said they just took the trash to the dumpster. That felt like a lie. The $5 off $15 coupon I had helped ease the pain a little, but after this experience, any future coupons I get will likely be redeemed at another location."},{"name":"Smallwares","address":"4605 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here seeking out this hot, new Asian/Fusion restaurant that took up residence there. Actually, 'fusion' is a term that they thankfully don't self-apply opting instead for 'inauthentic Asian restaurant.'  I appreciate their irreverence and I appreciate their food even more.  The Chicken Lollipops are simple, straightforward and very, very delicious. Crispy, golden brown on the outside and meaty and moist on the inside.  It comes with Siracha Mayonnaise; simple, effective and leaving you with the strange sensation of wanting to bathe in it.\\n An Octopus Salad with some of the most tender octopus that I've ever had.  It also included baby radishes, red onion, basil and a sambal dressing. It was fantastic and all the flavors and textures complemented each other.\\nBraised Short Rib on a Corn Cake with Avocado, Cilantro, Hoisin and Mango Jam Puree.  A lot of components in such a small dish, but each one of them was expertly prepared.  The braised short rib was tender, meaty and exactly the flavor you want when you crave beef. The bright, sweet corn flavor of the cake contrasted with the deep richness of the short rib with the cilantro, hoisin and mango providing some nice accents to the overall flavor of the dish.This may of been the high point of all the dishes that we ordered.

This review is specifically for the brand new mealtime kits that are being testmarketed in the Atlanta area. I purchased the two available today which was a chicken Parmesan kit and a chicken enchilada kit. Each kit contains a meal for two and is designed to compete with online companies like blue apron dinnerly, and with similar meal kits purchased from Amazon etc.. I have tried kits from the companies that I mentioned with various degrees of satisfaction. I will say right out of the box I was pleasantly surprised with Chick-fil-A and I observed that there ingredients were top shelf as I would expect from a restaurant with this reputation. I prepared the chicken Parmesan - this evening and found it simple and satisfying. The chicken breasts came marinated in their own individual pouch the broccoli was of an exotic type not normally available at your local grocery store the tomatoes were fresh there was even a fresh whole lemon in the kit. Surprisingly the pasta was pre-cooked and every attention to detail was addressed carefully and clearly as I have come to expect from the store bought competition. The prep was very minimal the mess almost non-existent and the results were very satisfying. I had a restaurant quality serving and adequate portion chicken Parmesan and pasta dish that was just perfect for my wife and I. I expect the other recipes to be just as satisfying simple and homely feeling as I expect every visit to Chick-fil-A to be satisfying. Doing the mouth as the whole kit costs just shy of $16 you have a nice home cooked meal for eight dollars per person. Very comparable to the competition, with the added convenience and confidence in Chick-fil-A. I like the fact that I just picked it up in the drive-through window and did not even have to leave my car.

Bottom line: a great bowling alley and better-than-bowling-alley food brought to you by the Twain's team. I just got back from my first visit and I'm so excited to go back. My wife and 17 month old joined me, so we didn't drink, but the array of cocktails is tantalizing. As far as food goes, we just tried the potato skins and garlic knots. Both were delicious, especially the sauce that comes with the skins. The rest of the menu has me dying to go back and try it all, in particular a Georgia Hot Chicken Sandwich. The bowling experience itself was fun and versatile. The computers offers several styles of game play as well as several fun graphic layouts for the screens. They have bumpers AND ramps for the little ones. We got our little man to use the ramps pretty well. Just a light push gets the ball rolling. Pricing on the lanes seemed totally reasonable to me. 30.00 an hour for up to 6 people. They also have two shuffle board lanes that I believe can be used for 15.00 an hour. The staff was super friendly despite being flooded with a rush of people literally lining up outside waiting for the place to open. I noticed some familiar faces from Twain's which is nice because you know they bringing over some experienced folks to help run the joint.

When we did finally decide to eat, I explained that I'm not a big eater and asked what the smallest menu item was.  Rather than giving me an item choice, he asked if I just wanted either some tacos or enchiladas ala carte.  Really?  Who does that?  Wow!  So I had an ala carte enchilada and it was perfect.

The owner came over a couple times answered some questions we had.\\nNow the food. \\nFirst if you are expecting a pizza that is stiff with a thick crust you will be disappointed. This is an authentic pizza cooked in a 900 degree oven and the crust i think is made with \\"00\\" flour. It is paper thin. In my opinion it allows for all the flavors to come through. \\nThere are 3 kinds of mozzarella cheese made on site. We had a prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella appetizer and the mozzarella was almost baseball size.\\nThe house salads were a spring mix of greens with a balsamic dressing and again very good.\\nThe pizzas are \\"personal\\" size but definitely 12 inches + for sure. \\nMy wife had the italiano which was shaved parmigiano,  arugula,  grape tomatoes & prosciutto. \\nI had a special pizza from the specials list.\\nMozzarella,  ham,sausage with an egg on top. It came uncut so you could cut into the yolk and let it run. This for me was a home run! I actually told the owner that next time i would order an extra egg because it was that damn awesome!\\nThey have been there 5 months. Prices i think are absolutely right based on the freshness and quality. We ordered desert but took it home so i cant say exactly how it was yet but i was told the pastas, pizza , mozzarella, and deserts are all made on site!\\nI saw boxes of pasta on the wall but they are decorations only as fresh pasta on the wall might look funky after a couple of days...lol\\nWithout a doubt we will be back!

Don't expect to get your slices in under 10-15 min. When the slices arrived, they looked great. However, I found them to be not so cheesy and rather stiff. I could not fold my slices easily. I sorta managed with the garlic slice, but I had to eat my white slice with a knife and fork. This must be expected since the bartender gave me silverware off the bat. The crust was rather crispy and I enjoyed that (I tend not to). Great portion size. The garlic far outweighed the white on taste. I would not order the white again, but it wasn't bad.\\n\\nI do think that the bartender didn't pay close attention to me since I only had a soda instead of a real drink.

Balanced, well-seasoned and well-executed. The price-point is quite good for the portion size. Even the simply dressed salad that came with the steak was exceptional. All of the mains on the new menu sound outstanding.

They've recently added a great outdoor patio as well, so the wait will be more bearable and you can enjoy the summer evenings as well.   The best nights to go are any Tuesday or Thursday when the First Cousins are playing (great rockabilly type band).\\n\\nAs soon as you arrive head the bar for my favorite margarita in Austin, the Silver Coin (Herradura silver, Cointreau and fresh lime).   This baby has teeth and after a couple, you'll have trouble walking in a line...  If you're a fan of girly margaritas (those with bottled sweet and sour), you should probably steer clear of this one and try something else like the Ranch Water.  You really can't go wrong with any of the drinks here though.\\n\\nFor dinner, make sure you start off with some of the crispy fried oysters or opt for the Don Combo which also includes calamari.   They'll bring you some massive biscuits with butter and honey as well, but be careful not to fill up on these as they are dense.   If you like wedge salads, the Ranch slice of ice is excellent.  When it comes to entrees, you absolutely can't go wrong with anything.

Among other really really nice suggestions, Miel was suggested. We took the advice because it was easy - attached to the hotel and would allow for a delightful waterfront stroll afterwards.\\n\\nI must say - armstrong (I think was his name) was a stand out. He made us feel welcome and exuded a warmness. Too bad he was just the guy who gave us water and bread (and picked up our waiter's slack).\\n\\nWe sat outside - which was really nice. Nice ambiance and view of the harbor. People watching was great. We had plenty of time to people watch as we waited for our waiter on several occasions.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things to do is ask the staff about stand outs on the menu - it gives a good chance to interact and get to know the menu from people who should know it best. Red inquired about the ribs, the steak frites, and the gnocchi. The informational equivalent of his response was \\"the ribs are good. They come with potatoes gratin\\". I mean - we can read... Just looking for another opinion...\\n\\nThe gnocchi was light and fluffy with a delicate flavor which was overpowered by the sundried tomatoes. \\nRed's ribs were surprisingly lacking potatoes. (I even had her check under the ribs) when she inquired about them, the waiter also asked \\"are they under the ribs?\\" I wish that all servers knew what their dishes should look like. Nope - no potatoes anywhere. Red did eventually get them (looking a little sad on a tiny little side plate).\\nBoth dishes were... Good.\\n\\nBut you know what just pushed it over the edge?\\nNot the waiting. Not the distant waiter.\\nNot the absent potatoes. \\n\\nIt was finding six cents at the bottom of my sangria.\\n\\nI started picking the fruit out of my sangria during one of the waits for our waiter. I tipped my glass and saw what I thought was a smushed blueberry at the bottom of the glass - I reached for it to discover it was... A nickel. The reflection of the blueberries made it blend in. I laughed for a full two minutes at the absurdity. Thank goodness I was drinking from a straw... Can't imagine having to spit that out after a nice big sip.\\nRed notified our server - who did take it off our bill. She the lifted the glass, as a joke, to check for more money. There now at the bottom was another penny.\\nReally?\\nI know it was only psychosomatic but I got this metallic taste in my mouth...\\nThe waiter assured me that he made the drink himself - fresh!

The menu should be a newspaper or the pizza liner should look like a newspaper. Instead, their menu is a small piece of cardstock that doesn't match their menu board or topping offerings. Store wasn't very clean. No sense of urgency but then again they only press one dough at a time and their oven can only handle a few pizzas. Then the end of the line gets complicated and backed up. At the start of the line, they press your dough upon ordering and then brush, not ladle, your sauce on (very limiting). Many choices for toppings and they put a good amount on. Pizzas get ran through a conveyor oven and then the line gets held up and confusing when they ask you to jump ahead to pay and then go back to have your pizza finished. The pizza is cut using a very large knife that is rarely wiped off of other ingredients that stuck to it and the knife does a very poor job cutting the paper-thin pizza. You have to tear your unevenly cut slices apart or get a plastic knife. Lastly, it's too bad they only have one take home box size option - an entire box - which you have to ask for at the register instead of being able to help yourself to one."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I've been to the Pig numerous times since they opened and I've waited quite a while to write a review.  I'm not sure exactly why but it's probably because I swing between loving and hating this place.  I love them because they have the most unique menu in town and the kitchen staff really knows what they're doing.  I hate them because they sometimes just phone it in based on their reputation.  They are like a pretty girl who knows everyone's looking at them so they behave like they don't have to try sometimes.  No one likes a stuck-up girl!\\n\\nThat said the food here usually is far better than any of their competition.  They bill themselves as a gastropub but I  think they've left some of that behind.  I'd say they're fine dining with some patrician leanings.  They have an absolutely killer burger on the same menu with house made charcuterie.  The charcuterie plate has always been one of our favorites but it's moved up and down the scale.  Mainly the portions have slowly declined since I first had it two years ago.  It's always excellent but I used to eat it as a meal and now two people can easily share it with a lot of room for more.  Curiously the price hasn't dropped.  On this latest visit my wife had mussels which I would put against any...anywhere!  Super plump and slightly spicy these were mussels at their best.  I had the fried mixed offal.  Yes I know that most people don't look forward to eating organ meats but I do.  This was a very generous portion of duck hearts, chicken livers and sweet breads cooked perfectly.  However I would not bread them the way they do.  It's a very \\"rough\\" cornmeal that doesn't seem to be cut with any flour.  A little more delicate breading would elevate this dish to sublime.\\n\\nThe pig always has a great drink menu and wine list.  I tend to go for the liquor and beer as the bartenders can really make a wicked drink.  I've never had anything less than excellent come from one of their shakers!  The beer list is always a top notch selection of craft brews and they know what beer goes with what.   The wine list is well thought out and extensive but it's also expensive.  They'd sell even more wine without the 300% or higher mark up.\\n\\nI love this place because you won't see these items on any other menu in town and they are a foodies wet dream.  I hate them because I feel compelled to return even after the visits that haven't rocked and we spent a good deal of cash for the experience.  Service is best at the bar by the way.  Our service at the tables have always been hit or miss.

Other than those two minor irritations, this place was wonderful! The main lobby bar was impressively designed and included a multi-screen huge display over the bar which ran underwater video of the ocean floor on a loop. It wasn't HD, but it was a nice little atmospheric touch. The furnishing were impressive including indoor pergolas with day bed lounges. Very cool.

The Mongolian Beef had zero kick to it and while I realize spiciness is relative to each person, there was simply no spiciness, although the flavor was good. \\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the staff were rushing around like mad and in all of the chaos, the table service was pretty terrible. Once they delivered our food, not one person came around to refill our water or ask if we needed anything. The only times they came by were to tell us around 9:15pm that it was last call for any additional food orders, after which they promptly delivered the check. We sat there for around 15 minutes waiting for someone to come by so we could pay the bill. Any other time we needed something such as more water, we had to raise our hand and almost shout at someone as they whizzed by to get their attention. Even then, the hostess set our waters in the far corner of the large table we were seated at, instead of taking the extra second or two to hand us the waters. \\n\\nTL;DR version: My wife loved her food.

I've always had a little bit of a tough time adapting to Taiwanese food.  I was floored (in a not so good way) by the oyster pancakes the only time I went.  It was just sooo strange with its ketchup gravy.  Sesame oil chicken noodle soup was totally not what I was expecting either.  It had something that looked like miso in it, but it was very bitter and strange.  Since that trip though (which was highlighted by some bao zi at ding tai feng), I've warmed up a little to Taiwanese food, especially their interpretations of sichuan dishes.\\n\\nYi Soon has sold me immediately as far as bakeries go.  How did I miss the bakeries when I was in Taiwan?!  Now I am upset with myself because if Yi Soon is any indication, Taiwanese pastries are so so so perfect for my palette.  Looking around, Yi Soon has a lot of the same staples as the Cantonese bakeries.  Pineapple buns, or polo buns as they say, which I haven't eaten, but look better than any I've seen in Chinatown.  The crust seems more like an intact cookie, and the bread is soft, egg tarts, sponge cake stuff.  They also have cream puffs, Japanese style, creme caramel, and a cheese tart.\\n\\nLike all good Cantonese bakeries which cater to Chinese tastes, Yi Soon's pastries are all light on sweetness.  On the other hand, given the cream puffs, creme caramel, and what is essentially a cheesecake tart, they haven't the Chinese aversion to rich dairy fat in their pastries, and I haven't got that either!\\n\\nThe cheese tart had a nice crumbly crust, much better than the run in the mill gram cracker base of a regular cheese cake.  The filling was extremely dense, moreso than regular cheesecake, extremely rich, but lacked the crippling sweetness that's difficult to escape from in cheesecake.  At 2.50 a pop, I'd take this over a slice from the North End any day.\\n\\nI will be back to try their other items.  The snow cookies look interesting, of course I have to try the sponge cake and polo buns, but I'm also looking forward to trying some of their savory breads, though I've always felt Chinese bakeries put together some really strange savory baked combinations.\\n\\nMy one complaint is that the stuff is gigantic.  The polo buns are normal sized, but the coconut tart is humongous, as was the cheese tart, as is their egg tart.  I only wish I could buy them in smaller sizes so I could eat more than one pastry before keeling over."},{"name":"Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant","address":"343 N Front St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Buca is decent, but they have the magical ability to make food 3 time more expensive than other Italian restaurants that are much better tasting than buca."},{"name":"Arepazo Tapas & Wine","address":"93 N High St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4.5","text":"It has very nice atmosphere, kind of dark and the wall was lined with wine bottles. \\nThere were plenty of seats with a few tables available outside. \\nThe service was good and the menu has a nice variety of food. \\nAll in all, it was a nice experience!"},{"name":"The Corner Suite Bistro De Luxe","address":"850 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Food: The crab eggs benny I had were were quite nice.

While the establishment is quite small and tucked away, we managed to get a table right away. While this is not high-end seafood, we were glad to try the fried seafood that was offered here. The seafood platter seemed to have spanned a majority of the seafood anyone who really wants to sample; mussels, clams, cod, oysters, shrimp, and scallops. While the oysters were breaded and fried (quite well actually), the clams, scallops, shrimp and mussels came in a light garlic sauce that complimented the seafood well. We opted to add calamari, as it was the one thing not included in the platter. We were pleased to find it lightly fried, paired with a nice tartar sauce. While it's a small resturant, it should not be underestimated for its service, nor food quality and quantity! Definitley worth a try!"},{"name":"Danny's Delicious Deli","address":"37 W Broad St, Ste 50","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place should be known as \\"Danny's corned beef heaven\\" - the quality, quantity, and the pricing of the corned beef exceeds any other deli in Columbus.   The place fills up quick, but the service is fast and friendly, and you won't wait long for a table.\\n\\nWhen you order a Reuben, you will not be able to fit it in your mouth it will be so thick. It's the same with the turkey Reuben, the chicken salad and the egg salad as well. You'll need to eat half the meat with a fork or your fingers before you can attempt the sandwich. Hot deli sandwiches will run you between $5 and $10 - with the Reuben's running around 9.00. Entree salads run around $6.00. Chips, fries, rings, and salads are offered on the side, as is the thousand island dressing and the spicy brown mustard. \\n\\nThe food here is extremely fresh - the salads like cole slaw and potato salad are made on premises daily. Their entree salads are fresh as well. They usually have a daily special and at least 4 or 5 homemade soups - the matzoh ball soup is outstanding - and they have tomato soup if you're feeling like some grilled cheese. \\n\\nI haven't had breakfast here - but it looks appetizing and pretty reasonably priced. \\n\\nUnfortunately, there is some bad news - the place is only open for breakfast and lunch Monday to Friday - which makes a little hard for the masses to come in and sample. The location itself is strange - the address is West Broad - but the entrance to Danny's is off of Front Street - at the entrance of the Huntington Bank underground parking garage. \\n\\nIf you are in the vicinity of Broad and High or Front Streets - definitely visit this gem. They have call ahead and a large take out business. You can also buy deli meat to go. There are parking meters on Front Street if you're driving. \\n\\nA better value over the Katz, IMHO."},{"name":"Yoi Yoi Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi","address":"857 Collier Rd, Ste 11","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It was pretty delicious!

Mkt looked like our closest and best option to the venue for drinks, so we hit the bar area. \\n\\nLet me start by saying, my hubby is a bartender and we are both lovers of all fine food and mixology, hitting up hopefully the best in each city we go to. That's all we do in a city besides an occasional show or museum in between. Not since we found Michelin star rated Spruce in San Fran last summer have we been this happy with a place.\\n\\nI got the Southern Belle Frappe and was immediately enamored with the clearly-to-order fresh squeezed juices and airy peachy liquor goodness that caressed every taste bud like a tender lover. Foreplay ladies. Because of this, I stayed true to this lover the rest of the evening, 'cause there is no such thing as too much foreplay... \\n\\nMy man got the Bridgetown Smash, the Sriracharac and the Brooklyn. Each were stellar. STELLAR. (I stole a kiss from each.) You could taste the fresh ingredients, watch the bartender squeeze them to order, pluck the herbs with pride, then finally shake that steel vessel like a true artisan. This is a man that knows his art and colorful flavor profiles. And we love art. \\n\\nOh! we search bars high and low for the Japanese whiskey Yamazaki, to which Market has. Naturally we needed a shot of that to share as well (hey, we were only walking that night! Don't judge...).  \\n\\nWe had sadly eaten before hand, so as the place filled up, only watched the plates go by in absolute envy. Finally green with it, we broke down and ordered the fried cheese curds w padron peppers as a tease--also fried making them these puffy delicate wisps of crunchy shreds of heaven, a perfect counterpoint to the gooeyness of the inner cheese curds. This ain't WI folks! \\n\\nSince it was crowded due to pre-show peeps getting their cocktail on beforehand, they did get a little spread thin. The pause between our blissful libations was probably a good thing to ensure we actually made it to said show with our pace, but a few times the (clearly) manager would jump in as needed and make sure waters were filled and all was OK. He was awesome. \\n\\nDay two...it was a no brainer where we wanted to go for lunch after looking over the menu the night before. Being on vacay, and suffering the pounding consequences of unwise liquor volumes the night before (remember how this story started?), we stumbled back over to the bar and claimed our same booth. My medicine was served up in one of the most unique tasting Bloody's I have ever had. I couldn't even quite tell what his (same 'tender from the night before) secret touches were. I suspect fresh squeezed heirloom tomatoes as the base, but from there....well played Alan, well played. (Looked his name up on their site just now.) \\n\\nFood....at the risk of not offending any religious group out there, just know that many proclamations of divine worship and sworn devotion toward every deity out there occurred over the culinary lunch gems we chose. (And can you hear the tears in my voice that dinner was not an option this trip?) \\n\\nNow bare with my storytelling for a moment here. It becomes relevant to the power of excellent food. Before we came for lunch, my man said he HAD to have a burger and he was gonna be pissed at me if they didn't have one. I assured him they would, since I saw them float by on heaven's clouds the night before. Plus, what place doesn't offer a burger option for lunch? \\n\\nWell...my bad! No burger and I had to endure intense solid moments of glaring while he battled with containing himself from throttling me over the table or getting up to leave to seek out his burger--to which he didn't want to come across as rude to the restaurant--and lucky me (us!) avoiding public displays of violence and courtesy saved me. \\n\\nTo which then, I must have been going for the tortured zealot badge, and made us start out with the fried green tomato salad. He ABHORS tomatoes. Would rather kiss Satan. The poached egg and starvation allowed me to get him to try a bite. To which I now regret because we began to fight over it. The yolk ran perfectly over the crisp breading of the tender yet still firm tomatoes, coating them in elation, the crunch and freshness of the fris√©e making for divine bites.\\n\\nWe shared the turkey, avocado, cheese sandwich and one of the best bowls of pasta in our life--house made angel hair pasta, bacon bits and various mushrooms. FRESH. Unreal explosive flavor. Simple made divine. \\n\\nI long to try dinner, and dote on the fact the menu changes daily to match local market offerings. The Executive Chef is clearly brilliant, masterful, a champion of the farm and animals served, bringing them together in a taste religion that I am a devotee of. Impressed! \\n\\nIf I had the power to give out a Michelin star, I would. I've only felt that for Spruce until now--over lunch and drinks!

What? Not even Starbucks is that much and everyone else complains how expensive they are, and yeah yeah I get it, it's a local shop and they serve you on a fancy little teaplate and mug, but like other reviewers I was also growled at by unfriendly and snippety staff behind the counter, who discriminated against me because I apparently didn't spend enough money to qualify for niceness by their business.\\n\\nWhen I went to order (this was at like 8:00pm), I asked if they had decaf (because who other than caffeine-immortals and zombie owls drinks real coffee that late?), and the person replied \\"We have an Americana\\". I'm not the most coffee aficionado snoot in the world so I asked if they would clarify what that was -- just a shot of \\"Decaf espresso with water\\". Oh, lovely. But I consented since I was already there, and that was the only option that wouldn't keep me awake all night long. I asked about their non-dairy milk options and decided, and he then asked if I wanted the milk \\"steamed\\". In fact, he must have asked me this three times at least, with saying finally, \\"But you don't want the milk steamed\\". I, not sure why he was being so pushy or repetitive said, \\"That would cost more, right?\\" He gave me a disgusted look and snarkily replied, \\"Right\\". So I responded back to him annoyed, \\"Right\\". And that was that. The pushy and eager salesman vibe exuded insidiously around me like darkening tendrils.\\n\\nNow, the person I was with (male) was chatting up the server and they seemed to be getting on great, probably because he got a $6 or $7 coffee and had been there before. My coffee was done a full  -10- minutes, at least, after my \\"date's\\" coffee was done, who was literally behind me in line. The cashier guy even came out from BEHIND THE COUNTER to serve it to him while we were sitting at our table, with a big smile, completely ignoring my presence with no eye contact and like they were having a secret laugh. But when mine was done after his? I heard a loud and annoyed yell of my name while he just stood there doing nothing behind the counter. The place wasn't even busy; there's just a few people sitting at tables. He just stuck my coffee down right next to him on the counter, without so much of a thought. WTF? Is that misogyny, sexism, classism, or what all rolled-into-one? It was a pain in the ass to balance this overfull mug (which at least they gave me enough for that $3.50 decaf coffee water) with the tea-tray to my table, and I was seriously annoyed that he was being so blatantly preferential to my \\"date\\". I don't care how much you pay; if you're supporting a business with your money, you should get equal fucking service and some hospitality! Equal! \\n\\nThat being said, the place was kind of relaxing; it's a big open space with two floors, so it'd be a fine place to do some work if you can handle the very rude, very intolerant, prejudiced waitstaff (unless maybe you're a rich white male, then you're all set!!). And, despite it all, the decaf water coffee with hemp milk wasn't bad, for what it was. I did like how they served it in a mug, even though it was such a pain in the ass to carry back. But I seriously am debating whether I ever want to come back here again -- I can easily spend $3.50 on a bigger, better coffee with nicer customer service elsewhere, big open space or no."},{"name":"Congee Noodle House","address":"141 E Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is really good, pretty packed each time I come.

My burger bun was stale when it came, the large salad I ordered came small, the fries were a bowl of extremely salty mush, and then they forgot to make my bfs burger so we awkwardly ate one at a time.

Fortunately for me, I'm fully aware of local health codes due to my career background.  That said, I wasn't questioning if they were safe to serve, just how long they've been sitting in their warming box.  The tacos are also smaller, they're not standard size tortillas.   You get more egg than other filling.  Honestly, it's not a good bargain.

I worked in Lynn the past 1 1/2 years and given its reputation, wasn't expecting much.  Well, I learned that you can't always judge a book by its cover.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Lynn has a lot of character and a LOT of awesome, truly authentic food from all over the world.  It is a cultural melting pot and food is the heart of Lynn.  There are LOTS  of hidden gems in Lynn.  Mittapheap is no exception.  At Mittapheap, the food takes a while to prepare (30-45 minutes) so be prepared to wait when you order.  That said, they prepare everything from scratch, using very fresh ingredients, and it is worth every second you wait.  If you order whole fish, they go to the fish market next door and get you a fresh fish!  The favor combinations are complex, perfectly layered, and delicious.   Food portions are average to large and I always leave with leftovers.  The price is pretty cheap as well.  When my boyfriend and I go we usually order a tea and/pr smoothie, a salad, an appetizer, and two entrees.  It usually costs around $30.  While less authentic food is offered on the menu, I urge you to try the more traditional food for a real taste of what Southeast Asian food is all about.  I assure that you won't be disappointed.  The ambiance is very basic, nothing fancy, but don't let this deter you from dining here.  I'd rather have an amazing meal in a casual neighborhood restaurant then pay tons of money for beautiful ambiance and average food.  If you are willing to sacrifice atmosphere for a truly amazing meal, you area true foodie, and this is a foodie's heaven.  Also, be aware that the service can vary from very good to slow and not that attentive, but the servers are always extremely friendly.  If this will be a big issue for you, it will deter from your dining experience.

I made a reservation and then called directly and they were able to get us in only 15 minutes later at 8:00 for a party of 11. All of the staff were friendly, we were seated quickly, but I will say it seemed a little chaotic. We got all of our food at slightly different times, they took our food orders before our drink orders, and we had to remind them of a few missing items, but we received everything in a reasonable amount of time. Anything we reminded them of, they happily got for us as soon as they could. But the food was all pretty amazing! It was truly flavorful, I had a sauce on my carnitas that was wonderfully spicy (surprisingly so, in fact), but everyone in our party seemed to enjoy all of their food. We will definitely go there again. It is conveniently located to the Disney area and has plenty of parking. The restaurant seemed clean and well themed and was pretty full. If you're not an adventurous eater, there are some basic options you can order, but be prepared for some spice here and there.

Got seated and ordered after we tracked down a waiter. After some time we ask the waiter to check on our food. After asking him twice he comes back and tells us that it will be 45 min for our food.... this is after we've been there for 2 hours! The waiter checked on everyone else around us .. I guess cause we weren't drinking and everyone else was. Not to mention the bartenders drinking margaritas and taking shots at the outside bar.

The sauces and cooking process really deliver a truly original taste and texture that's absolutely unforgettable. The moment I tried their 'chipotle & stupid hot' sauce combination, I didn't know whether to cry for joy or cry from the spice. Their sauces are hot and make the baked wing combo a relationship in heaven. It's like they're spanking my tongue and... I like it. The strawberry option seems a bit strange, but totally works with their spicier sauces. May I suggest sriracha? Cook time usually averages 20-30 minutes though, so be prepared to wait! Sometimes it can be an hour during their weekend rushes. I tend to wait for the slower hours because I like to not accept my social security checks at Jack's. Thursdays at 3 work best.\\n\\nTheir pizzas have a great take on what toppings are defined as. It's either a hit or miss with that portion of the menu. I've tried just about everything and it seems like the 'soul food' pizza takes the crown when it comes to this Italian American delight. It sounds odd, but it definitely works and may leave you curious about their other plates.\\n\\nTheir burgers are unique, I'll give them that, but doesn't compete with anything else on the menu, to be honest. I'll be blunt, they're the garnish to the other options. They're not bad, but they're definitely not memorable though they're perfect if you want to fill up. Their portions are pretty big.\\n\\nDrinks? Great specials and even better specialties. Bartenders here are the type that do not mess with nonsense... because there's no sense in nonsense, right? They're very friendly and quick! Totally worth the buy.\\n\\nParking is horrendous during rush, almost as bad as the wait time for food. Despite some of the flaws this small places carries, I have much respect and love for it. Probably because of the wings. Yes, most definitely because of the wings.\\n\\nIt's not the prettiest place, but its got heart. Come here for a casual outing and stay for some the great drinks.

Any Asian joint that cranks out any type of ramen that is markedly different than the 10 for a dollar cups at Walmart deserves a shot.\\n\\nHere, I felt humbled in judging a book by its cover. The ramen was surprisingly good. The broth, though not super rich or complex, offered spicy notes. The simple noodles could have been exchanged for some more traditional ones--regardless of whether the classic \\"curly\\" noodles are housemade or not, curly signifies college ramen to me. I am a little nitpicky about eggs in soups, and it was certainly my fault for adding the egg. but the unbirthed chicken fetus was not gold and moist. Ratherk, it was nearly the hardboiled pastel \\"Easter\\" yellow color. I feel bad in judging the egg, as my ordering it was purely optional, but I must factor the egg preparation quality into my thoughts.\\n\\nOn the whole, Banzai surprised me, though the atmosphere felt a little off. For lunch, the dark vibe appears to promote the \\"sushi bar\\" sort of vibe, but you are eating chicken teriyaki and fried rice.

If you've been to one restaurant of this type you've been to them all: Buffet style of chopped raw veggies, spices, and protein to be mixed and cooked up on a giant stone wheel before being served back to you in a bowl that you'll carry to your table. However, if you don't speak English (such as my ex's entourage), having to guess at each and every uncooked ingredient hoping you don't come up with some horrendous combination can put you a little on edge. Add in the questionable sanitation of the communal cooking area (I see no problem with it as I'm sure that stone is 10,000 degrees, but ex-mama did not approve), some pre-existing family tension, slow service thwarting exit strategies, and voil√°! You now have the recipe for a perfect storm of a meal.\\n\\nThis BD's location is no better nor worse than any other one I've visited, but every time I see it a pang of anxiety shoots through me remembering that one tremendously awkward night.

This dish was a disaster - very thin slices of salmon (not sure what species, but labelled as 'wild'), arranged on a thin bed of what was likely diakon, and some kind of sauce.

The vegan tempeh comes on marble rye (as it should), and they use some tangy mustard in there, the seeds of which are present in the sandwich.  The cheesesteak involves a tempeh hash and daiya cheese.  Sandwiches were served with chips and salsa, which is a nice departure from the fries I'd expect as a side with such sandwiches, but also nothing to rave about.\\n\\nA few beers were on tap, and I tried the Vanilla Oatis Stout, which I thought went well with the sandwiches, not that I'm an expert at beer-food pairings.\\n\\nOne major strike against the place is the prevalence of flies inside.  I imagine that it may be contrary to the vegan ethos here to take measures to kill flies, but measures to keep them out might not be a bad idea.  \\n\\nAlso, if you're not a regular here, you may feel self-conscious about it; it's obvious that there's a profile shared by the majority of their clientele.

They were buttery, flaky and hot served with a side of butter with smoked salt on top.  You could easily taste the chives inside but minimal gruyere flavor. \\n\\nAs the mains we initially ordered the Nashville hot chicken and the lobster roll.  The chicken was cooked well but I wouldn't really call it hot. More of a BBQ style than hot. I've never been a fan of shoe string fries so those were pretty much pointless. \\n\\nAs for the lobster roll as originally stated it had maybe 3 oz of lobster on a 6-8 in roll topped with a ton of peppers and slices of cucumber. When ordered we were looking for the more traditional style roll and this was far from it. This was almost like a bahn mi. With that said we asked to switch it out for the French dip sandwich. \\n\\nThe French dip was slightly better but still came with a random side of pepper/citrus spread. The meat was covered in cheese and with out the Au jus it was very bland. Also served with a ton of unappealing shoe string fries. \\n\\nThe server was polite and did okay for the most part but the food wasn't much to brag about.

I just never heard much about it I guess.  Monday was probably my 4th or 5th visit in the last 12 months.  It's locally owned and I always like to support small business.  \\n\\nThe selection is fine for a little sub shop.  They have some overlap with Subway but they also have cheese steaks.  I lived in New England for a while so I tend to avoid cheese steaks elsewhere because they don't get it right in the least.  I have to say that Skibo's other subs are a half step up from Subway but the cheese steaks are that in name only.  If it isn't made to order on a flat top with the bun placed over the cooking meat and veggies it isn't a cheese steak.  One can argue yes or no on the cheese options but pre-cooked meat and veggie mixture is not a cheese steak.  It's a sub with veggies and beef.  Fine if you like that sort of thing but I could walk to 3 or 4 places when I lived in Boston that would of been right at home in New York or Philly.  This place not so much.\\n\\nThe toppings are better than most places.  The bread is standard American white sub bread.  No crusty baguette or sourdough to be found here but it is Florida and the price for citrus trees in our yards and wearing sandals all 12 months is that the bread here generally blows.  If you're from here then I'm sure it's fine.  You can't know what you're missing so this is the way it's supposed to be.  The meats are bit hit or miss.  Some are higher quality than others.  The hams seem pretty good but the turkey always has a very processed quality about it.  The Cuban isn't too authentic but it's very, very tasty.\\n\\nI haven't tried the meatball subs or any of the salads.  The potato salad is fresh and they've opted to let you control the salt level.  Some would call that bland but I don't mind.  You can always add some but you can't subtract it.  The place is always quite clean which is a plus.  I would say this visit they had staged some meat and onions to cook for cheese steaks on a cold griddle.  It's disconcerting to stare past an employee at a 15 pound pile of raw steak and a bunch of onions sitting in a pool of blood on a stone cold flat top grill.  I would rethink this plan if I was in charge.\\n\\nAll in all it's ok.  It's local.

The communal tables and peninsula bar are excellent for socializing. The service was exceptionally attentive and wait staff quite knowledgable. \\nWith that said, only a few minor changes would make this an amazing place and a regular haunt for me and my friends. First of all, dim the lights! It is difficult to relax, sip a glass of wine, nibble on apps, and chat with your neighbor when its bright enough to perform surgery at the table.

(More like constant flatulence.) Seriously, it annoyed the wait staff just as much as us and they work there! Put rubber tips on the bottom of the legs of the 50 bar stools at least or change them out.  Bar stools that have backs on them would be optimal however just having stools with the proper height so anyone shorter than 5' 9\\" can rest their feet on the pipe like foot rest at the bar instead of dangling your legs while searching for a place to rest your feet and support your frame. \\nLighting and bar stools...rookie mistakes for most bars.

Well, then there's also the CEO comment thing, but this review's not here to talk about that. The food here is okay, though by no means exceptional.

That doesn't necessarily speak for all the other Chick-fil-A locations that I didn't visit, but this review isn't about them either.\\n\\nTo start with, this place is pretty overpriced for fast food. I got a deluxe sandwich, a fruit cup, and an iced tea totaling more than ten dollars. It's a bit unreasonable. And the sandwich itself is really nothing special; it just consists of chicken, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The fruit cup had sliced strawberries, apples, oranges, and grapes that were probably kept in a refrigerator for a while and weren't fresh. And the large cup of iced tea was just that; there's no reason it should have cost $1.79! If the food were a little better and the prices were lower, then I might like this place more.

Hit up yelp for something close by when I saw Assembli, based on the pics and some of the previous reviews I thought I'd give it a shot. \\n\\nReally not a bad walk from Bentall, took a couple minutes running in between buildings dodging the rain. When I walked in I noticed they had a L shaped bar with employees on the inside making the pizzas/salads and customers ordering then moving down the line customizing their meals. Definitely a cool idea just like Chipotle so I was hoping I'd have my zzaaaaa and be on my way in no time.\\n\\nSadly this was not the case, ended up waiting about 25 minutes to get my pizza from the time I gave my order. To give you guys the low down they have one dude at the counter when you enter grab your order, take your name and ask if it's to go or not. He then takes your order(which is a square sheet with your details and passes it down to the dough dude. I guess there were some back orders so by the time he got mine about 10 minutes had passed. They then go ahead and pass it down the line once more to the preppers, one who spread the cheese and neatly placed meats and another dudette who handled the veggies. This is where the large amount of orders slowed things down again. My pizza sat next to the oven waiting to be baked for another 5-10 minutes while other orders were being cooked. It appeared the same guy who was putting them in the oven was slicing and boxing as well which I feel was slowing down the whole belt.  \\n\\nI apologize for ranting a little, it's just frustrating when you have to wait almost half an hour for something that should take only a third of the time. Now I'm sure because they're still new and working out the kinks it'll be 5 stars soon but till then I'm giving Assembli 2 stars based on my experience. Prices are pretty solid which is hard to come by for fresh pizza like this, $7 for classic 6 inch and $14 for large. I got the 6 inch Hawaiian which unfortunately was soggy due to too many pineapples(yes they do belong on pizza's just in moderation aha).

For the short version, skip to the summary at the bottom. If you like details, enjoy the read.\\n\\n30+ MINUTES JUST TO GET OUR DRINKS!!!\\n\\nA few of us went to the Zac Brown Band concert on Saturday night, and we went here for food and a few pre-concert drinks. It took 2 hours for an order of steak fajitas and 2 orders of veggie fajitas. We were seated and didn't see our waitress for about 20 minutes. When we did, we ordered the first round of margaritas and an order of chips and guacamole. Over 30 minutes later, our drinks came, followed shortly there after by the chips and guacamole. At that point, I ordered my second drink, to the waitress' surprise. I then had to explain that I was doing that in anticipation of it taking another 30+ minutes to get it. We also put in our food order at this point. Again, 3 simple dishes.\\n\\nBy the way, this place was not at all busy, but the World Cup was on, and the entire staff seemed to be watching, to include the kitchen, which was obviously staffed with people cheering for the two South American countries that were playing at the time, and not cooking.\\n\\nSo, fast forward 35-ish minutes to my second margarita showing up, not as ordered. I'm not a salt on the rim kind of guy. So the guy at the table next to us, who was also waiting unacceptably long for his drink, said he'd take it if I didn't want it, so that worked out. It took another 15 minutes to get the correct drink.\\n\\nRight around when the correct drink came, so did the fajitas - almost an hour after they were ordered. It doesn't take an hour to make 2 orders of veggie fajitas and one order of steak fajitas. Absolutely no way. I will say that the food was decent. But when you staff your kitchen with people who've ate and cooked their food for their entire lives, it shouldn't suck anyway, so really, I don't say this as a compliment; it's more of an observation.\\n\\nThe real kicker is that our waitress only had our table and the table next to us. The 5 or 6 tables that were occupied around us were getting the kind of service you would expect from a place that wasn't at all busy. Most of these other tables got there well after us, had so many drinks that they were running out of room on their table with all the empty glasses, and got their food at the same time as we did.\\n\\nNow the bill. I had 2 margaritas. Not because I only wanted 2, but because the service was so bad that it was now just after 6, and we needed to get out of there in time to get to Fenway for a show that was supposed to start at 6:30. So, 2 drinks for me, 1 for each of the other people there, that makes 4 total. There were 5 on the bill because they charged me for the drink that they messed up that ended up going to the table next to us. So I wanted to speak to the manager. The waitress comes back with a new bill that dosen't have my 2 margaritas on it. So I remind her that I want to actually speak to the manager. She leaves and comes back with, \\"He's on the phone and says he can't come out.\\" Ok. So I wait. Meanwhile, my friend, not of the same 'chew-and-screw' mindset grabs the bill and pays it, not without my protests. But she's a girl, so I wasn't going to get all handsy and controlling like some DB just to prove a point. Now I get a face-to-face with the manager, who really didn't seem to care. He told me they were slammed which is why service was slow. A valid point, if the tables all around us had experienced the same issues, but they didn't. He must not have had much faith in my observational skills or ability to use common sense. Then the 40-something, bald, short bouncer chimes in. Next time we come, he says, he'll make sure they treat us like royalty. He doesn't ask our names, doesn't give his, doesn't give a card or any way what-so-ever for us to identify ourselves for this royal treatment. Another genius, clearly thinking he can just pay some quick lip-service and call it a job well done.\\n\\nIN SUMMARY:\\n\\nDON'T F*CKING BOTHER WITH THIS COMPLETE DUMP!!!!!"},{"name":"Caffe Lil Italy","address":"178 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Best hot chocolate ever!

Not exactly something I would go back to Orlando for, but it was good. We started with the queso blanco (because I'm obsessed) and salsa--both were tasty. The queso was the same that you would get elsewhere but the salsa was a bit different--had a little kick to it, which is nice.\\n\\nMy boyfriend went with the chicken fajitas with flour tortillas, which he liked. I opted for a hodge podge of options--the chicken tortilla soup, an adobo chicken taco and mexican corn on the cob. The soup was interesting--they \\"prepare\\" it right in front of you and it had a different flavor than I'm used to with tortilla soup; more \\"earthy\\". The taco was good (they offer both flour and corn tortillas) and the corn was delish, though it was a bit heavy on the cheese and butter. \\n\\nEl Patron is a good option for more traditional Mexican food.

I'd never had grits before, but these were creamy with a good kick from the cheddar. I still crave them to this date! The pork belly was full of flavor (and fat) and the egg was perfect- I loved mixing the yolk with the grits and eating it with the pork. My dad got the local fish I think, and he thought that it was good, but nothing super special. My mom ordered the steak that came with mashed potatoes and cremini mushrooms- this was delicious! The steak was cooked to order and the mushrooms had incredible flavor. The mashed potatoes were extremely silky and full of flavor. Our server was kind and friendly, often checking up with us. He also gave us lots of bread, which is probably the best part about The Wave- the whole-grain bread, combined with the sea salt butter is incredible. We also ordered the American trio for desserts, and it was okay- the s'mores tasted fine but the marshmallow was very cold and it was hard to stick the fork into the dish. The panna cotta was delicious, with a mellow coconut flavor and bright passionfruit boba. The carrot cake was okay, but nothing special."},{"name":"Tavern In The Square","address":"120 Beverly St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We live right around the corner and only recently visited Tavern.

To my dismay, they were no larger than a nickel and maybe one third the size that she indicated.  However, this dissapointment doesn't compare to the $35 NY strip that he got.  It was fatty AND bland--is that even possible unless it's just bad meat??  The only flavoring came from the melted butter on top--a sauce that would be adequate if we were eating at Denny's, but not at a restuarant such as this.   Furthermore, the steak was paired with an embarssingly large shoestring potato \\"side\\" that easily could have been dinner for a four-top of teenagers but was an absolutely ridiculous portion size of fried food for the two of us.  \\n\\nDespite the bland steak and bite size scallops, my husband insisted that we have dessert (he had informed the waitress that it was my birthday earlier in the evening, and was anticipating a candle with dessert, as she had promised).  Twenty five minutes later we finally caught our server's attention.   She placed our order and took our steak for a \\"doggy bag,\\" which she totally forgot about.  Our water glasses were empty for 20 minutes as she dissapeared and we finally flagged her down to pay the check. \\n\\np.s. The dessert had no b-day candles in it but was almost inediblely gross.

I stopped in on a whim as there were many cars in the parking lot at 11:30 am, thinking it might be a good old fashioned Tex-Mex place.  NOT. \\n\\nI ordered very traditional cheese enchiladas and a tamale.  I was presented with plate that had a brown sauce smothering all of the food items on the plate.  The \\"cheese\\" enchiladas were a process food product similar to Velveeta that been applied with a squirt bottle over the top of the brown sauce.  If these were cheese enchiladas, then where was the cheese inside of the enchilada?  \\n\\nThe tamale had no meat.  Everything was very salty, which may have served to have the patron otherwise overlook the lack of flavor.  As I write this 3 hours later I have a headache and am waiting for the bloated look tomorrow.\\n\\nAs someone who knows how to make cheese enchiladas, I know the sauce is made with chili powder so it should be red in color.  A quality cheddar cheese should be inside of the enchilada, not a fake processed food product squirted over the top.  Raw onions are usually sprinkled on top to give it a bite, enhancing the flavor without the need for excessive salt.   \\n\\nI'm willing to forgive a place for being a \\"dump\\" if the food is of good quality, however no go here.

The dish also included pieces of thick cut bacon, which was delicious unless you happened to get a piece with any fat on it.  The pieces with fat had soaked up so much of the smoke flavoring that it was like a tiny Chuck Norris inflicting pain on my tongue.  To his credit, our waiter noticed how little of the dish we ate, and removed it from our bill without us even mentioning it. \\n\\nThe rest of the meal started out well with the scallops. Good flavor and it was well cooked. Then came the shrimp and grits.  The grits were actually pretty good, but the flavor was dominated by hot oil.  There was no need for a palate cleanser between the shrimp and the mushroom ragu, because the ragu was dominated by the same oil.

We went last on a holiday Monday where they were advertising all day play specials the entire weekend and should be expecting patrons. Based on the staffing, it appears they expected no one. We (4 players) bowled two straight games (80 throws total) before having a server wait on us for food and drinks. The bathrooms were not stocked and if we had not had bowling to keep us occupied, we would have left long before waiting on the server.

We arrived Friday, April 15th for a 3-night stay, and did not want to leave!  From the moment we arrived, we enjoyed every minute.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful!  \\n   We got a room in the new tower, which was awesome!  Loved the built-in tv in the large round mirror in the bathroom. (which doesn't get fogged up)  What a nice touch to have the sensored nightlights that come on as you step around the rooms in the dark.  The bed and pillows could not possibly have been more comfortable!  \\n     Speaking of comfortable, they really have thought of every need...robes, a refrigerator, a safe, even an umbrella.  They have some really cool \\"stock the fridge\\" packages you can purchase. (which didn't appear to be as outrageously expensive as you might expect)\\n    Absolutely adored the duck theme everywhere...from the cute little duck soap in the bathroom, to the ducks on the bathmat...every time you turned around there was another cute duck to admire.  And, of course, the duck parade is not to be missed! (Be advised that children might see a part of nature they might not have seen before...we've witnessed this a couple times with the amorous ducks).\\n      We tried the Beeline Diner a couple times and found the food to be pretty darn okay, although a tad expensive.  I will say that I enjoyed a chardonnay that I feared would be ridiculously expensive there, then was very pleased to see it was only $6 per glass.  Also, saw some earrings in the gift shop that I liked and was stunned that they were just $9.99!  Yes, you heard right!  ( the protein drink my husband bought there was $5 though...who got the better deal?  HAH!)\\n      Valet parking was $20 per day plus tax.  Service was quick and friendly for it.\\n      There is a \\"resort fee\\" at this hotel, which is pretty darn typical for the nicer hotels in Orlando, so it was to be expected. It was nice though that this meant internet was available.  This was invaluable to us when we found out that tornadoes had hit our home town while we were gone!\\n    Would have loved to stay longer and try out the fitness center, perhaps the spa, and some of the other restaurants.  Rocks Lounge had live music Friday night when we checked in, but we were too tired to go enjoy it.   We spent two whole days in parks, so we spent way less time than we would have liked in the hotel itself.  \\n    I might add that we are not pool people, but seeing the pool from the hall window near the elevators from our 13th floor made us want to be pool people and have the time to experience it.

The only selection was a \\"Caution Allergy\\" checkbox without, it seemed, a place to actually put what the allergy was (to be clear, GF for me is a preference, not an allergy).  So I asked for a GF crust in a comments section.  I got a call from Bill's immediately after I placed my order, saying that GF pizzas come in one size, large (I had ordered a small) and that the hamburger topping was not GF (which I found very odd and asked they simply omit it).  I do give Bill's props for their very swift resolution of these issues, but it could have saved time and hassle (particularly on their end) by adding options and information on their website.  Granted, I could have called to order my pizza in the first place, but online ordering, even with dietary restrictions, should be simple to do if the restaurant serves items that fit those restrictions.\\n\\nWhen I picked up my pizza (piping hot!), I was told what I owed - 11 bucks more than the small I originally ordered.  I was expecting my bill to be more since I was now getting a large, but the price for the regular crust large was 7 bucks more than the small, and I was now paying even more than that.  Again, information that would have been nice to have on the website.  I know I could have asked when they called to resolve issues with my order, but I really wasn't expecting that much of a price difference.  It was a very expensive pizza.  When I got it home, the pizza was indeed large (pretty much everything GF is smaller than it's non-GF version so this was nice to see), it was loaded with toppings (many places skimp) BUT the crust was completely soggy.  Not good.  Later I put the leftovers in a skillet to get the crust nice and crispy, which worked beautifully.\\n\\nOnce I cooked this pizza on the skillet, it was very good.  Toppings were plentiful and fresh and the crust (again, once it was cooked properly), was one of the better GF crusts I've had.  But if I'm going to splurge on a pizza on the pricey end, I'd rather not have to cook it myself."},{"name":"The Wave... of American Flavors","address":"4600 N World Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"It's my least favorite restaurant in Disney property.

I don't know if he was in a bad mood or what but he too was so arrogant and made me feel very uncomfortable because I started to feel bad for my friend who just wanted a casual conversation. Why is it that French waiters here are so snob and act like they are superior than their customers?

The vegan marionberry scones are huge, full of berries, and only two bucks, although I haven't seen them around on the last couple of trips.  Also worth mentioning is the relatively sizeable bulk section.  Anything that should be available in a stocked bulk section is there.

The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because of the unexpected wait time and the fact that there were flies buzzing around in the lobby area (this could've been related to the fact that they had their front door open).

The meats at Porcini's are much better though, a lot more flavor, and much more juicy. Staff was very friendly.

By that I mean, the original oval sized pizza with square cut pieces, glorious prawns, tangy sun-dried tomato, savory pesto and a Jalape√±o kick. \\nThe stuff pizza dreams are made of! \\n\\nBrown's was happening and the service was terribly slow. I'm assuming with service that bad there must have been a few Sunday morning sick calls??? It took forever to get our drinks. I actually saw them sitting on the counter for what felt like all eternity. I thought about going to get them myself.  \\n\\nWe ordered Ceasers, of course. One of us might have been hung over.  One double, one single, both tall. When we finally got our drinks I couldn't tell which was which and the server didn't know either. Right...\\n\\nWe ordered the Biltmore 2.0 as that was the whole  reason for going to Browns. I crossed my fingers that it would be like it used to.... lots of tasty toppings with pesto and juicy succulent prawns. It showed up in a round pan, smaller than it used to be.  It was a little bigger than the one we ordered from the 4th ave location but still smaller. It really is an appetizer now. A $17 appetizer \\n\\nAs I gazed into the sadness that was a poor resemblance of my favorite pizza, I was horrified by the pathetic morsels of prawn that were scattered on top. Bye bye full sized pizza and full sized prawns. There really wasn't much of any toppings on my pizza. It was not made with love and it was a huge disappointment. Pesto was sorely missed as well. I really hoped a different location would be better but I was sorely wrong. \\n\\nBrown's head office or who ever is in control of your food decisions, this is such a big mistake! \\n\\nFunny enough, I was so disappointed about that sham of a pizza in front of me, the neighbors in the next booth heard.  Apparently, my neighbor ordered the same thing and had became apprehensive about her choice. I told, don't worry.... it's still a tasty pizza, but it used to be mind blowing!!!!!! \\n\\nThe waitress asked how the pizza was and I told her that it was okay, but disappointing compared to what I used to receive.! Management came over to check in about my concerns. I tried to explain my disappointment with the pizza and how it has changed for the worse. She explained that the Biltmore is now the 2.0. and that's what has changed. No no no. It's been the 2.0 for sometime now and I have probably eaten 50 of them since the change. Best way to explain things is sometimes with photos! I busted out yelp and showed her some pictures of how the pizza used to look, full sized prawns and all. \\n\\nHonestly, if you are gonna change $17 for a prawn pizza you could at least put one prawn on each piece of pizza. It looked like one prawn was diced up and shared throughout the whole pizza.\\n\\nNeedless to say, my neighbor wasn't too impressed her pizza either. She said it was dry with very few toppings. \\n\\nThe manager did take the pizza off the bill which was an appreciated sentiment, but honestly I just want Browns was make my favorites pizza properly, like they used to.\\n\\nBF ordered his usual Blackened Chicken Bowl.

The food, ambiance, and service all were so memorable that I have been thinking about the meal that I shared there with my girlfriend for the past week and a half.\\n\\nIf you want to eat at the Ravenous Pig, plan it out in advance because weekend reservations can fill up weeks in advance.  Having that said, my girlfriend and I decided to walk in close to restaurant opening.  We were able to be seated outside but could not be offered a seat inside for about three hours.  Amazingly enough, it was a beautiful day.  Sitting outside on the street made me feel like I was in a more urban and trendy location than Orlando.  The inside, though, is the perfect place for a date.  Seriously, consider making a reservation weeks in advance.\\n\\nThe menu changes daily.  We ordered a craft beer, Gruyere Biscuits, Pork Belly & Nantucket Bay Scallops, Boynton Beach Pompano, Steak Frites, and the bread pudding with the  Nutella ice cream dessert.\\n\\nI've been thinking about the pork belly and scallops for the past week on and off.  The scallops were little sugar bombs that exploded in your mouth when you tasted them.  The dish was sauteed and the pork belly complemented the seafood in a way I haven't experienced in a while.  The presentation of this dish was a work of art.\\n\\nI could go on and on about how the rest of the menu items were so fantastic.  Usually, I like to go to a restaurant to talk to people about their lives and feelings.

Plenty of seating areas, lots of natural light, and cute cartoon drawings on the table.\\n\\nThe guacamole was moderately thick, short of paste-like texture. You know you're getting good stuff when the tacos have freshly chopped bits of oregano.

Jack's is low-key, dark, and grungy.  That's not a bad thing though, far from it.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, you've gotta get their pizza and oven baked wings.  A slice is good for one person, but you'll probably want to order an appetizer, side, or small order of wings to go with it to fill up.  The crust is thin, so a fork and knife are a must at the beginning unless you are the type of person that likes to fold their pizza.  Just be cautious about the landslide of toppings you'll get if you fold.  The pizza toppings are creative and generous, and the wings have multiple flavors to choose from.  Personally, the hot sauce for the wings was more of a mild, but it had good flavor.  The meat was tender and fell away from the bones easily.\\n\\nService on a weekend afternoon was appropriately timed and the waiter working the back porch was friendly, attentive, and chill.

I asked for something more spicy and my server brought a small container with habanero sauce. I mixed the two salsa together and got the great flavor along with the right amount of heat. \\n\\nMy side dishes were refried beans and Spanish rice served and a small cast-iron like skillet. Sadly the skillet never solve a stove and the Spanish rice was not just room temperature cold it was refrigerator cold. Although my server never came by to ask how the meal was, I eventually got her attention and told her of the problem so that other customers would not be disappointed. She offered to bring me a fresh set of side dishes but at that time my meal was already completed.  Even though the rice was cold, the flavor was so good I still probably ate half of it.\\n\\nThe restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with comfortable seating.

Our waiter was particularly amusing and helpful with suggestions and didn't at all ever seem upset with us even though we were a large group. Even when we asked if we could each get separate checks. \\n\\nThe food was beautifully plated and the perfect temperature. I hate when hot food comes to you real hot that you have to wait five minutes to eat or you'll be injured. I had the \\"Golden Gate\\" fish special. It was sole, tomatoes, mushrooms, leeks, white wine that was wrapped in parchment accompanied with a salad made with arugula, baby shrimp and pears. I really liked my salad because it was exciting to eat, so many flavors going pop in my mouth. My entree was good too, just not the highlight of the dinner. My friend and I shared a starter of beets served with micro greens, Gruyere and a tasty orange glaze. I never would have thought to have cheese with my beets, so it was a nice tasty surprise. I also got to try the dirty rice begniets which I recommend. They were crunchy and full of flavor. The dipping sauce they are served with is also really good.\\n\\n I even ordered dessert, which is rare because I'm usually too full and in a food coma to want any. I ordered the Coconut Cream Cake. The cake slice was huge! It was wonderful. The cake was a nice solid butter cake and filled with cream (but not too much to make the cake soggy) and the frosting was fantastic white (think marshmallow fluff-like) with long lovely shreds of coconut. All our desserts looked fantastic and tasted great. The faux hos were so cute! Our super awesome waiter even brought over spoons that were loaded with rich creamy ganache. Amazing.

Usually when the family needs to make a quick pit stop to gets its Korean food fix, I don't expect much because 1) we're far away from LA Koreatown 2) it's just a typical restaurant that isn't famous for a particular dish. \\n\\nI don't think this place is amazing, but I was pleasantly surprised that the Korean Chinese dishes hit the spot and I left satisfied. The main 2 noodle dishes in Korean Chinese cuisine are Jjam-bbong  (spicy seafood noodle soup) and Jja-Jja-Myeon  (black bean sauce noodles). Another dish I adore is Tangsuyuk  (sweet & sour pork or beef), which is fried beef or pork in a sweet & sour sauce -- that shit was awesome as a kid and still awesome for me today.\\n\\nMy sister was the outcast in our group and ordered a regular Korean dish, bibimbap . It's mixed vegetables and meat on top of white rice that you mixed together. She told me that it was bland. I told her that I believe her. If a place can't make a simple Korean dish taste decently good, then yeah...I'm just recommend you to get the Korean Chinese dishes all day long. It's interesting for a Korean (me) to recommend Korean Chinese dishes over KOREAN dishes that Koreans (the restaurant) should be awesome at making. Fill me in please. I'm intrigued.\\n\\nI don't know why I only took a picture of the fried dumplings we ordered and not the rest of the dishes. Err enjoy! I present to you my photographic essay: \\"fried dumplings, a memento\\"\\n\\n# This is a Korean Chinese restaurant = Koreanified Chinese food. Koreans taking Chinese food and making it their own. Just like how Americans grabbed Chinese food by the gooseneck and turned it into Panda Express.\\n\\n# Don't order anything else except for the Korean Chinese dishes like Jjam-bbong  (spicy seafood noodle soup), Jja-Jja-Myeon  (sweet & sour pork or beef), and Tangsuyuk  (sweet & sour pork or beef).\\n\\n# If you're not Korean (most likely) and you don't know what to order, I would recommend to get the Jja-Jja-Myeon and Tangsuyuk. Those 2 dishes are good and the safest bets for you.

The dumplings were also notable and a lot of people were ordering them as well. \\n\\nService:\\nThe service could have been better. It took them awhile to take our order. You order by marking things off on a paper menu, but it is all in Chinese, making it difficult for us to order. I also wish they were more helpful with that. \\n\\nParking: \\nThere's a ton of parking available since there is a lot here with access to different stores. \\n\\nOverall, this was some of the best Chinese food I had in the Richmond area.

Service. Ever. Perhaps in all of Portland.\\n\\nI honestly don't know why I keep coming here. Maybe it's because I continue to hold onto hope that \\"next time\\" it'll be different (i.e., less terrible). Or maybe it's because this is one of the only places in the short distance from my place that offers coffee treats & desserts late at night. Or maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment. \\n\\nWhatever it might be doesn't really matter, as every time I come to Rimsky I am always astounded by how horrible the service is. No matter what time of night (just opened or mid \\"rush hour\\"), no matter how full or busy (just me + a friend in the entire place or 15 sweet-toothed patrons) the service is deplorable, absolutely, maddeningly gouge-my-eyes-out-with-a-rusty-spoon god-awful. \\n\\nLet me illustrate.\\n\\nI once waited 30 minutes for change to be brought back from my paid check. Thirty minutes. If it hadn't been a $20 & I had only spent $5, I would've just walked out & left a $15 tip.

I'm willing to overlook how poorly they make their coffee drinks (it was here that I had the worst cafe aulait of my life).

We went to Kennedy's Steakhouse for dinner, and it was not a good experience.\\n\\nSome positives: they have great clam chowder, and most of the food was pretty good. Prices are reasonable for a hotel restaurant.  They offer a couple of local MA beers, although the waitstaff knew nothing about them, and gave the beers we had ordered to the wrong people at first.\\n\\nSomething weird: the guacamole. They make it with bacon and bleu cheese. What?!? I love bacon, and I love bleu cheese. Even though I live in LA, I'm open minded enough to try weird, doctored up guac. But this just didn't work.\\n\\nThe bad: the restaurant was extremely loud, so much so that it was difficult to talk (and the restaurant was not full when we were there.)  The kitchen does not seem very careful: some of the food was not served the way it was described on the menu (for example, my mom's quesadilla was supposed to come with cheese, and did not.)  \\n\\nOur waitress was friendly, but incompetent. I felt bad for her -- like she was in way over her head, and was trying hard but had no idea what she was doing. Perhaps she was new and needed more training?\\n\\nThe REALLY BAD: The Kennedy's menu has gluten free items specifically listed. My sister has celiac disease, which means she gets very sick if she eats gluten. We were thrilled to see that the hotel restaurant had designated GF items.\\n\\nWe were NOT thrilled that the \\"gluten free\\" guacamole she ordered was served with FLOUR tortillas.  (Corn tortillas are GF; flour are not!)  This was the first sign that the restaurant does not really understand or take food allergies or intolerances seriously.\\n\\nMy sister also ordered onion rings marked GF; when asked, the waitress assured her they were prepared in a separate fryer.  And she also ordered a GF salad.\\n\\nWell, something was not prepared how it should have been (the onion rigns? the guac? the salad? who knows!), because my sister had a terrible gluten reaction the next day.  It was a textbook gluten intolerance reaction, and we are positive it was caused by Kennedy's, as that was the only place she had eaten within the time frame to give her the reaction.  She was miserable at our family event.\\n\\nObviously, I don't expect every restaurant to be able to cater to food intolerances like GF.  But if a restaurant specifically advertises that it is GF friendly, and has GF items marked on the menu -- and THEN can't cater to it!?  That's unacceptable.

The owners/management must be horrible because they have so much turnover and some of the people there just shouldn't be in the service industry.

When this happens, owners or managers should show up but they don't causing the drive thru to be extremely long and very time consuming. Last time I was there, I waited 10-15 minutes just to order and there was just 5 cars in front of me. I think I saw over 5 cars leave the line.

Now on to the review of the food - this was one of the three chowders I had while visting Boston. The Chowder was perfect and fresh (almost too perfect - read on). When I came to Boston for Memorial Day Weekend I sought out a locally made fresh as can be filled NE clam chowder with tons of seafood in it. \\n\\nThis one had the best tasting broth, freshest potatoes, and the clams that were present were extremly good. After a few bites and being extremely critical (acknowledging my own food snobbishnesh) only faults are : could have been more seafood in the chowder and there was not anything extremely unique about the chowder as a whole. I stand by my statement this was the best of the three chowders I tried in the Boston area - the other two were more unique espescially the one I ordered at LIR however like anything in life its your personal preference on what you are looking for. Is it a good bowl of chowder or a unique one of a kind chowder? I recommend this spot for the view, location, great price points, and do not think you will be disappointed.

I remember he had a very unique first name.  I thought the decor and lighting were charming and authentic.  Great back bar to gaze at - the cool calming blue was something out of a Caribbean cruise or private club.  The designs and accents were very intricate.\\n\\nI ordered the breakfast bowl with Bologna as my protein.  It was very good, not a huge portion, quinoa, egg, farro, mustard seed, it was decadent, yet simple.\\n\\nMy friend had the breakfast sandwich, that too looked pleasing, however it was small, I could've devoured it in few minutes.  Glad I chose the Bowl.  I too, chose the Pilsner.  They don't advertise breweries, so unsure what beer it was exactly.  They have a small offering of bottle beer, too.  Naturally, handcrafted cocktails are the theme. Lots of options.  \\n\\nAs we were mid-meal, the place became a little busier.  Folks seemed to be gathering into one corner and upstairs.  Some of the staff or ownership were having their own family gathering.  I became suddenly anxious when one of the guests propped her baby on the bar countertop.  The bar!  And not just for a minute, several minutes!  I found this appalling.  Okay, so first I didn't know it was a kid friendly establishment, no worries there.  However, for a patron to set their young infant on the bar top next to me eating and drinking was strange and illegal.  \\nLater she and baby retreated to the family party in the back of the restaurant.  The baby wasn't fussy, it was a cute baby, but still, this is a BAR, a BAR TOP, not a counter at the Laughing Planet.\\n\\nOur service sort of fell apart after they had folks gather in.

But it's not. And any person who knows good food will find out with a bite from one of Bunk's tasty sandwiches. \\n\\nThe Pork Belly Cubano is a fattier twist on the traditional Cubano but pays due respect to the original sandwich with tangy mustard, pickles and melty swiss cheese.\\n\\nThen there's the Roast Beef, dripping in au jus, smothered in perfectly piquant horseradish and spicy dijon and topped with nicely caramelized onions. \\n\\nLet's not forget the almighty Pulled Pork sandwich. The pork is delicate -- every strand is pulled apart with love -- and it's moist to the point that the pulled pork glistens when it's first unwrapped from the foil. The apple cabbage slaw made in-house delivers a nice tang and a sweetness that makes the pulled pork milder and lighter.\\n\\nThe piece de resistance of all of these remarkable sandwiches, of course, is the bread because it's never the same yet remains consistent, appropriate and delicious. For the cubano, a crunchy and flat baguette. The roast beef is held together with quality white bread. The pulled pork is nestled between two poppy seed buns, soft and tastefully oily.\\n\\nI don't need to say any more about Bunk -- if you ever find yourself in Portland, you'll need to drop by ASAP."},{"name":"Hungry Howie's Pizza & Subs","address":"1025 S Dillard St","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3","text":"There may not be a huge selection to choose from in terms of local pizza spots, but I believe Hungry Howie's has the best pizza around.

It's greasy and tastes like cheese only. \\n- Fluke Dish: They filet the whole fish and make sashimi and you can eat with Japanese style (wasabi and soy sauce) or Korean style (spicy sauce, lettuce, pepper, garlic). I usually like to eat Japanese style, but this fish goes better with Korean style. But I have to say it is $60. It's not cheap. This dish also comes with 4 raw oysters and 4 clams. Oysters are a bit dirty, and the clams are hard to chew. I had to spit out the clams eventually. The miso soup that comes with this dish is super salty.

She asked us what we wanted to drink and any appetizers we wanted. She brought us a big thing of chips and 2 salsas. Little did we know... that was all we would see of her for a whole hour after immediately putting our food in. I get being in the service industry it can be difficult. That sometimes you may have more tables than you can handle. (Sadly, there are no excuses for what we just endured because there were maybe 3 tables being used at that time.)  When I finally received my orange juice an hour later and then our food FINALLY came out you could tell my plate had been sitting under a heat lamp for a good while. The cheese and beans made that crust film over it. You know, when you can poke holes in it and see that the top layer has dried and hardened. We waited so long for our food that we were full from the chips and salsa we had. We immediately asked for to go boxes as we had been sitting there hearing the employees in the back repeatedly bang on something, non-stop the whole time we were there. She finally came to get our card to pay which was an act of congress in itself, and we waited a good 10 minutes and she was still just walking around and still hadn't even processed our card. After the continuous banging on whatever they were hitting, we couldn't take it anymore and we went to the middle and asked if she could just run our card. She said yes here you go just leave it here when you finish and walked away.

I ordered sushi and the quality was on par with presentation.  The manager made sure she checked up on how my friend and I were doing.  She didn't seem like she was rushed or forced to talk to us.  Very relaxed atmosphere.  My friend and I vowed to definitely come back.\\n\\nEach time I went, I enjoyed the WOW wings much more than the chain BonChon.  The flavour is definitely present and the taste is superb!\\n\\nThe 3rd time I went with some true food afficionados and they LOVED the sushi as top grade sushi means a lot to them.  We ended with the cheesecake dessert which was ridiculously awesome!\\n\\nThe most recent experience was last night and again the WOW wings were absolutely perfect.  The manager again was beyond friendly to making sure our experience was memorable.  My friend had the opportunity to take advatange of the complimentary crab rangoons which she read were not like your typical crab rangoons and she said they were very good,  This specialty drink called the White Dragon is a great drink if you want to combine your drinking experience with dessert.  We were amazed at this drink's flavour and presentation (a nice orchid, edible too!)\\n\\nThe ambience is welcoming and gives you the feeling that you will have a great experience.\\n\\nService was never a problem but even if it ever comes to that point.  I am not someone who complains about service if I am having a good time.  Talking with your company can make time go by so quickly.  As long as the staff does not look depressed which was definitely not evident - I am going here every week if possible!\\n\\nThe manager is one of my top 3 favorite managers at an established Asian restaurant - my other two would be All Seasons Table and Island Hopper.\\n\\nHappy eating awesome people!!!!!"},{"name":"Romano's Macaroni Grill","address":"2290 NW Allie Ave","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3","text":"Poor rating because I walkd up to one of my fave lunch spots in Tanasbourne and it was closed for business.

There were assorted cheeses (soft and hard) as well.\\n\\nThe highlight, however, are the small plates. We had a leisurely brunch and tried several of them. Depending on your tastes some are outstanding, and all are well prepared, innovative dishes.\\n\\nFirst up, the Bacon Wrapped Sea Scallops. They have endive but that's appearance as far as I'm concerned. The pine nuts were fine but the rosemary honey dressing was too sweet for me. The scallops though were fresh, well cooked, and very flavorful. Second was the Crab Cake Benedict - it's a traditional poached egg but that's where it stops. It has spinach, and shallots, and a roasted red pepper hollandaise. But the real innovation is that it rests not on an English muffin, but on a crabcake. A bit over the top, but interesting.\\n\\nThe best of the small plates was the Steak and Eggs - it was a nice slice of steak, well seasoned, resting on truffled hash Browns, spinach and on top was a sunny side up egg. It was innovative, flavorful, but still captured steak and eggs as a dish. It looked like an eggs benedict with steak but absent hollandaise at first.It was very pretty on the plate as well.\\n\\nThe Sausage Omelet is just that, but it was well done with sausage, onions and cheddar cheese. The Croque Monsieur had B√©chamel, honey ham and Swiss cheese, nice enough. The Toasted Baguette with goat cheese and tomatoes was more similar to a bruschetta, but good. The Cr√™pe aux Fruits Rouge had saut√©ed mixed red and black berries and white chocolate shavings and the cr√™pe was nicely done. Very good flavors, great mix of berries and the white chocolate.\\n\\nService was very good, the view was nice (though winter is less exciting to look at on that segment of the river in winter than in summer). The manager stopped and chatted when we engaged with him, and remembered us the next day when we stopped for the regular hotel breakfast. Excellent food, good prices, excellent service, I'd recommend it for brunch. The regular breakfast menu is a bit overpriced in comparison to the brunch, and I've not had their lunch or dinner."},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"It is one of the best indian food restaurant, I have eaten so far. The overall experience bags the coveted 5 stars. Begin queuing up around 5 if you want to be seated in the first sitting and I say choose the main dining room for an overall experience. Where on earth have you seen a chef/ owner welcoming you at the entrance? chef Vij greets and meet every single guests. If only all the other restaurants want to learn the key to his success, just make it personable. Service was good overall and every single person did their job perfectly well. \\n\\nThey begin the evening with passing around nibbles while you look at the menu. \\n\\nTry the lamb popsicles, chicken and fenugreek with lime leaf with naan. I personally didn't find chickpeas that great so if you are keen on veggie, order something else.\\n\\nDesserts - I loved the gulab jamun with dessicated coconut but the mango kulfi .. Umm not so much especially after the gulab jamuns. Very tiny portions so you will not be guilty of eating dessert after a full spread.\\n\\nWine was excellent, a bit pricey but that's expected in a restaurant of such high caliber.\\n\\nThe decor can certainly be worked on and so is the restaurant's website. The information about its sister restaurants are all over the place and in need of some critical revamping. \\n\\nOverall bill came up to about $98 for 2 and we added the tip because we were happy and would certainly return again. Perhaps try its sibling outposts in the city of Vancouver.\\n\\nThe only thing I felt this restaurant to be little pretentious because when I requested to reserve a table, I was told by their VP communications that, it's first-come-first-served for everyone - Prime Minister's, Martha Stewart and Jamie Oliver all included! Had she mentioned first come first serve, that would have suffice but adding big names left a bit of sour taste to begin with. Still I went to see it for myself, what's really the hype about? It was good no doubt and I will happily queue up. After all I am a commoner and have no ego issues but yes sometimes things can land negatively and deter people. So here that pushes me to take a star off, not that they care but something for the restaurant to work towards."},{"name":"The Ruby Dragon","address":"N Mississippi Ave & N Skidmore St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I got the quinoa blueberry pancakes with chocolate chips and it was disappointing.

The Highlands location fits into the area nicely - a good dose of non-chainy feeling flavor, with things like condiments housed in plastic lunchboxes, a handwritten sign proudly announcing that No, you will not be seated if you're on your cell phone, and a staff that has cooler tattoos than you do. \\n\\nAs for the pizza - we went basic with a cheese. I'm a pizza crust kind of girl, and I approve of the consistency of this pie's dough. A tasty pizza. The garden salad was pretty basic and decent enough; and did include one rotten tomato. But they're not called \\"Johnny's Salads\\" for a reason - pizza's why you show up (or even call in for delivery) to Johnny's. \\n\\nThe Final Crust?
