And indeed, my experience mirrors that of many others: Good food, but it's pricey. I think that's the bottom line with this place.\\n\\nMy husband and I came by on a day where a football game was playing but we were still seated right away and it wasn't too loud. Our beers were delivered promptly and I was offered a cold glass for my bottled beer. In fact, our server even asked me if I wanted her to pour the beer into the glass, which I thought was an odd but attentive choice (I'm good on pouring my own beer, thanks).\\n\\nWe ordered 93 octane wings with blue cheese for an appetizer and they were brought out quickly. They're breaded wings, FYI, so pretty substantial and they hold on to the sauce well. The blue cheese on the side actually has large chunks of blue cheese in it--awesome. Usually you just get a cup of something that seems like it's probably ranch, but this blue cheese is for-real blue cheese. The sauce was good; not too hot, not too mild, we'd order these wings again for certain.\\n\\nFor my burger, I agonized over two choices (Stairway to Heaven, with foie gras, or the Wild Thing, with blue cheese and tomato jam). I chose the Wild Thing and the server commiserated: \\"Oh, that's one of my favorites!\\" And it was a tasty burger. They're 1/2 pound, this one bison meat, and you could definitely taste the blue cheese. The tomato jam honestly seemed lost in the flavors, though. Lettuce, onion, and tomato are offered on the side if you wish. It was messy, it was big, it was tasty. I'd get it again. Oh, and the little seared \\"B&B\\" on the bun's a cute touch.\\n\\nMy husband got the Sympathy for the Devil, which has chili, cheddar, and jalapeno. He ordered it because he thought it would be hot, but said it really wasn't. He finished the burger, then went to eat his fries and dipped them in a cup of what he thought was ketchup but was actually the habenero sauce served with the burger. We both assumed the sauce would just be *on* the burger, not on the side--at least not unless requested that way--and so maybe the servers should let people know that, hey, by the way, that cup isn't ketchup, it's your habanero sauce. He said he'd order the burger again to try it the way it was supposed to be, but without the habanero sauce on it, it was just okay. \\n\\nThe fries were good--I got duck fat (thick) fries with an amazing garlic aioli on the side and the combination was fantastic. I ate every fry and could have eaten more if I wasn't stuffed. His thin (skinny) fries were good too, but I think I got the better end of the deal with the aioli.\\n\\nDessert options looked tasty, including Twinkie \\"fritters\\" (I'm guessing your average fried Twinkie) and fried Oreos, served with various ice creams and sauces. We had no room to try any though.\\n\\nIn fact, if we went back, we'd probably split the Wild Thing burger and get dessert. Why? Because 1) it's a lot of food you get and 2) it's expensive food. Our bill--for two beers, wings, and two burgers--was $70 with tip. That's a lot to throw down for a burger joint. We enjoyed the food; I'd gladly come back; but honestly, I'd come here waaaaay more often if it were even a little cheaper. \\n\\nLike, that Stairway to Heaven I was eyeing? It's a $25 burger. I know, I know, foie gras on it and black truffle aioli, but really, I could get a steak for that price and enjoy it just as much. As it is, my Wild Thing burger was $20. Did I enjoy it $20 worth? I suppose. It's not like I couldn't afford to eat it. But I'm a lot more likely to go down to Burger 21 right nearby and enjoy a fresh burger and shake for a lot less. The $70-100 per couple check feels to me like a classy night out, a farm-to-table restaurant, a great local steakhouse--not burgers and beer near the University.\\n\\nService was attentive (in fact, almost too attentive; I think the servers are still trying to get a handle on how often to drop by and ask \\"Can I get you anything? How's everything?\\") As an ex-server myself, I know it's hard to get it right and I don't fault them at all, but maybe a little less \\"checking in\\" if the customers look like they're doing okay. The atmosphere was nice: roomy, clean, and well-lit.\\n\\nI wanna see you succeed, Burger & Beer Joint! Lower prices? Dinner specials--not just lunch specials? Coupons? Something?!

Everything else is absolute garbage... the kind of garbage which is still damn delicious, but on a good day is greasy and on a bad day is grease.\\n\\nSo here I am home for winter break, and I figure I'll type delivery Chinese into Yelp and see if anything new pops up.  Nothing ever does.... I mean who would open a new...\\n\\nWAIT WHAT IS THIS?!  A NEW PLACE?!  A REVIEW AVERAGE GREATER THAN 2.5? THEY DELIVER?!!!?\\n\\nI called up and asked them for the leek pie and lamb teriyaki as per the other reviews on here, then asked them for their suggestion as to an authentic chicken dish as spicy as they could make it.  I heard chicken, chili, and cabbage and said, \\"Souuunds good!\\"\\n\\nThe leek pie I was not a fan of, but it was very interesting and well made.  I wasn't sure what to expect, and unfortunately it wasn't up my alley.  However, I know the difference between, \\"Bad,\\" and, \\"Not my thing.\\"  I only wish it was!\\n\\nThe lamb was excellent... but honestly very different than I expected.  It was very good meat, much better than I would expect from your average delivery Chinese.  No real teriyaki flavor at all, maybe the skewers spawned the name?  Instead you get good lamb rubbed in a unique chili flavor with little red chili flakes still on the meat.  Delicious, but again, NOT your usual flair.\\n\\nFinally was the, \\"Authentic chicken dish of their selection.\\"  I believe the name was chicken with chili and Chinese cabbage.  WOW.  This is what I was hoping for, but not really expecting.  Very large portion of excellent and plentiful white meat chicken with delicious cabbage in an oily chili flake sauce.  Did I say chili flake sauce?  Let me rephrase: chili flake sauce with about 2 pounds of actual chilis on top.  The entire top layer of the dish was chilis and chili flakes.  Now THAT is what I'm talking about!  Very oily, but in a purposive and delicious way.  Not greasy, oily.\\n\\nAll in all, although I didn't love the leek pie and the lamb was good but not amazing, I recognize that the ingredients, preparation and delivery time were a class above the rest of the Chinese restaurants around here.  However, the price was as well: $34 delivered for a smallish leek pie (smaller than your standard scallion pancake), the entree and the lamb skewers.  I think the ~$7 lunch specials are your best bet.\\n\\nI'll be visiting Golden Garden as many times as possible before I fly back to school in the land of Panda Express."},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!

Definitely more Brandy than the milk tea version. Lastly the orange juice is good, fresh squeezed off site, not there, but still fresh squeezed.

Their noodles and broth are scrumdillyumshish.  The broth has so much flavor!  They have wide variety of \\"bombs\\" as well which of course are for an extra charge.  The pricing is a little on the high side but you do get a lot of food.  \\n\\nThe bad - \\n\\nThis is bad based on my personal preference.  It's an order at the counter type of place with the possibility of communal seating (you are assigned a seat once you order and you don't get much choice about it), hence the long line you will see every time.  I don't really mind order at the counter places, but since this place is so popular, there is always a line.  Waiting 20 minutes to be seated at a table is a lot more acceptable to me than waiting in a line for 20 minutes.  Secondly, because there is always a line, the door is basically always open which either means a blast of hot air in the summer or a blast of cold air in the winter every minute or two.\\n\\nThis ordering method, unlike Hopdoddy's which has a hybrid counter service and table service model, there is no table service at all, so make sure you order everything you want which includes kaedama (seconds) from the very beginning, otherwise its back of the line for you again.\\n\\nI would say because of this service model, this is not a very kid friendly place, although some brave parents are always there.  \\n\\nThe second thing which is more of a disappointment than a overall negative thing is that they only serve tsukemen for dinner (they close between lunch and dinner).  I've never been there for dinner so I can't comment on how it tastes, but I wish they would serve it at lunch too.

I thought the prices were comparable to a high end sushi restaurant, but the quality was not. It was just OKAY. The beef appetizer, which was recommended to us, was really nothing special. It was okay, though. Paltry serving of edamame. I did like the way they brought miso soup when we sat down. That was a nice touch. The tuna poke appetizer wasn't that good. Too salty and didn't have that yum factor I've had in other places. The sushi was hit and miss. One of the expensive rolls we ordered was done very poorly, in my opinion. The salmon on top was overcooked, and there was oil pooled in the bottom of the serving dish. Not the fresh, crisp kind of sushi I prefer. Some of the other rolls were pretty good, though, and I can see why some people like this place. It's probably better than most in the area. The friend who I was with thought it was very good, but he's the type who orders California rolls.\\n\\nMy overall impression was that HJB was striving to be a five star restaurant ... but they didn't hit the mark. If the prices had have been lower, my standards would have been lower, too. I probably would have rated it a 2.5 if that was an option, and I wavered between rounding up or down from that.

Living across the street also has its perks because you can regularly check the line when coming or going into the building. In my first week my boyfriend had to stay home while the furniture was delivered and jumped at the opportunity to get Franklin BBQ when he saw the line die down to a 20 min wait. I told him to order EVERYTHING off the menu. Who knows when we would get another chance to eat here? Ok that might be dramatic. \\n\\nHe ordered samples of everything they had left and when I came home from work we had a BBQ feast. We had two kinds of brisket, (the fattier one was heavenly), pulled pork, ribs, and sausage. The meats and BBQ sauces truly were amazing.

This place is huge, and our bill was really cheap, which is awesome.  We ordered a side of guacamole with our chips and salsa, and the guacamole was good, even though I didn't really dig the onions in it, and the salsa was so so.  I channeled my inner sorority girl and ordered a blended strawberry margarita, which was yummy.  For dinner I got the steak and blue cheese salad, which was killer for like $7.  The service was a little slow, but they still had a packed house.\\n\\nJesse and I came here the other day for margaritas for lunch, which is highly recommended, in my book.  Added bonus?

The food itself was pretty good, but what I didn't like about our visit was the awkward experience and the price.\\n\\nWe got here at 11:04 last Saturday for lunch and the hostess told us we needed to wait because they didn't open until 11. I wasn't going to be that person and point out the time, so we just said cool and stood out front. A few minutes later she told us we could go in and as we did we walked right into a meeting the staff were having in the middle of the main floor. \\n\\nAs we sat down one of the waitresses in the group yelled that she would be with us in a minute. It was slightly uncomfortable, and when she finally came over I actually caught myself apologizing for being there purely out of habit from feeling like we had imposed.\\n\\nAt least service was great (seeing as we remained the only table there until we left) and the waitress had our salad and drinks out quickly. We shared the Cesar salad and it was okay, nothing special and certainly not worth $9 in my opinion. For the pizza we got a small deep dish since we didn't feel like hauling leftovers around for the rest of the day. It comes with 4 slices so it's the perfect amount for 2 people.\\n\\nIf you aren't familiar with Chicago style pizza, they take about 30-40 minutes to bake. Bring some friends, share a few appetizers, but don't make the rookie mistake of getting full before your pizza comes out. Pace yourself because if it's done right it will be worth it by the time it's ready. \\n\\nOurs had lots of melted cheese which I love, but the crust didn't do it for me. It's a little too flakey which is great for pies but not pizza. I like more of a chewy dough personally. \\n\\nAll in all, I am glad to have a Gino's here in Austin. While it's no Giordano's, it fits the bill when my craving hits. But $50 for 2 people at lunch is crazy. For 2 beers, a small pepperoni and garlic pizza (toppings are $2.75 each), and one salad? No.\\n\\n$2.75 to add fresh garlic is ridiculous when I can go buy a head of it for 50 cents at HEB. In downtown Chicago, yes I expect these prices but in downtown Austin not so much.

Second, how delicious does their dessert counter display look!? So enticing. Each item was calling my name. \\n\\nI got 3 goodies to try and I'm ashamed to admit that I've consumed two of them.

When I think of a ginger snap, I think of a crunchy cookie. Ya know, it makes a snapping noise when you bite into it (right??). This one was soft and crumbly. The flavor was good, but I didn't taste pumpkin and the nutmeg (or some other similar spice) was a bit overpowering. I wouldn't get this one again. Overall I'd give it a 5/10. \\n\\nThe banana cream pie, however, was un-friggin-believable!! Seriously. It was delicious. Perfect crust, banana chunks on the bottom, banana cream filling, and then whipped cream tipped with chocolate shavings. Every layer was perfect. This one gets a 15 out of 10. A+++!

The busboy was apparently in such a hurry for whatever reason that he plowed into the mother, pushing her and her children against a table so he could get to wherever he was going. I was appalled that he failed to use any common sense or manners; let the paying customers and children through first! Boyfriend and I called him out at the time, but he either didn't hear or pretended not to. Thankfully, another staff member did hear (FOH manager, maybe?) and pulled him aside to talk to him.

I got the onion burger with bacon, my BFF got a bacon cheeseburger, and we split the 50/50 (fries and onion rings).

The fries were OK, crisp and well fried but also WAY too salty.  BFF said his burger was good, the bacon was crisp but nothing above and beyond a typical bacon cheeseburger.  My onion burger was...something else.  The caramelized onions on the burger are phenomenal, they're so good they kind of act as their own kind of BBQ-y, onion-y sauce.  Delicious. Unfortunately the onion burger also features the previously mentioned (and dreadful) onion strings.  Blerg.

We ended up deciding on all different plates to fill our palate. \\nWe ordered from both the regular and special menu alike and it goes something like this: If I could describe the Se7ven Benedict, I'd call it mount biscuit with a light delicious hollandaise sauce. Yes, the casual eggs Benedict sits on top of a 'platform' but theirs is topped with another filling biscuit. We also had the 7th Trimester which was basically the Se7en Benedict's sister but instead of hollandaise sauce, you get a heaping supply of shell mac and cheese. Equally as delicious with the mac being shells and the cheese being how I like it, nice and thick; best of both worlds. On the special menu we had the French Connection with a side of grits. Picture your stable breakfast combo, layered, and smothered in hollandaise sauce. This one of my favorites and it was even had a biscuit sidekick. Oh and not to mention the actual side of grits, I loved how how cheesy and thick they were (there seems to be a trend here) and it was arguably one of the best naked grits I've had yet. Last of the four was my Farmer's market sausage sandwich. Sandwiches doesn't usually catch my attention but this one did and I'll tell you why.

Unfortunately, I'll have to echo a great deal of the other reviews here. Venue: yay, food: NAY.\\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer of the fried jalapenos, which was the most boring fried jalapeno I've ever had. The jalapenos were seeded and had no spice. They must have been dropped in rock hard frozen because the cream cheese came out at the firmness level that you'd spread on a bagel. The breading was bread crumbs in their most basic form with no seasoning to flavor it at all. To avoid choosing just one meat, I ordered the Stubb's Minor plate: two meats (turkey and brisket) and two sides (mac and cheese, serrano cheese spinach). Others have spoken of a fake smokey flavor and it's funny, because my first thought when I bit into my meat was that it almost seemed like it was flavored with liquid smoke. The turkey was a little dry, but alright I suppose. The brisket wasn't dry, but beyond the fake smokey flavor on the exterior, the meat had NO flavor. It was extremely disappointing. The mac and cheese wasn't very good at all I'd have been happier if they told me they'd run out but had a box of Velveeta shells and cheese they could make. I don't know what tub the cheesy spinach came out of, but they need to throw that muck away. Cheesy spinach should be awesome and this was just bland and gross. I did have a small bit of the pulled pork, which actually wasn't bad, but I've had better.\\n\\nOur server, while polite, took the order and took off. The only other time she came to the table was to deliver the check. The runners brought the food out very quickly, which is great, but when the highest compliment that you can pay the food is that it's edible, you'll feel like you're cherry picking for something good to note.

Their house salad is a cut above the rest, in that it contains beets (or 1 little piece of a beet).  And the key lime pie is tops.  That's the best thing on the menu.\\n\\nThe weak point was service.  It was hard to be noticed in there, and service was slow and not even luke-warm.  \\n\\nAlso, parking is a HUGE cluster.  The lot is super tight, with people parallel parking their boat-like cars along the side, making it tricky to escape from the few angled spaces.

Carlos isn't too shy about showing off his food, so you will see all the main courses right behind a sneeze guard made of bullet proof glass or diamonds or something.  Nobody is fucking with this mans food.  He usually lays out the same courses each day; Roasted Pork which is super crispy on the outside and soft as a baby on the inside.  He also has ribs which fall off the bone and are super tasty.  Whole roasted chickens that he breaks in half right in front of you with his bare hands.  Also chicken with peppers and steak with peppers.  All of which can be served with white or a delicious yellow rice, fried plantanes, potato salad, macaroni salad or salad salad.  Pricing is typically consistent, based more on what he can fit in the tray as opposed to the variety of food you choose.  Also available is a very tasty seafood salad, comprised of shrimp, bay scallops, red onions and peppers doused in a lemon sauce.  Minimal, yet delicious.  Let's talk burritos.  His burritos are AWESOME.  You can choose from his steak and pepper selection or his chicken and pepper selection, which he covers with cheese, beans, onions, lettuce, tomatos, rice and this delcious pink sauce (mild or spicy (get the spicy)) which I can only imagine is the blood of gods mixed with some MSG.  He then throws it onto a panini press so when it's all said and done... and all the smoke clears... and the dust settles, you have a beautiful crispy burrito.

So I do not get out here that often. When I am in the neighborhood, however, I try to get in here when I get a chance. Stopped in here yesterday and had a pint of Blue Moon ($4.00). A good price, considering some places charge $5.00 or more for a pint. I did not have anything to eat, but everyone I talk to tells me about how good the hamburger and wings are. I did buy a nice t-shirt for $12.00. Nice to find a place that has a 2XL. Usually, I have to go to Omar the Tent Maker to get some clothes that fit, but anyway.....\\nTwo ladies sitting next to me at the bar shared a basket of cheese fries. The french fries, smothered in cheese, looked appetizing. One of these days, I will have to make it in for lunch. \\nOne problem with the Hideaway is that it is dark and dimly lit. It makes reading a menu a task.  I was able to make out a few draft beer selections on the menu for the beer selections, and there are a few beers on draft (Bud Light, Yuengling, Blue Moon), and several bottled beers. There is also a full liquor bar. And drinks are reasonably priced. As for draft beer, there are pints, half pitcher, and full pitchers available. There is a big bulletin board promoting any drink/kitchen specials if that helps.\\nThere is a pool table, and several televisions playing sports. On the weekend, this is a good place to go and check out a game. There are televisions on the patio as well. On the weekend, seating on the front patio is usually taken up. But it is a great place to sit, have a drink, and watch the world go by if you can find a seat.\\nA few problems I have with the Hideaway. One is the parking lot. A rather small parking lot. There are times I continue to drive by when I see that the lot is full. If you can hit it at the right time, however, there is usually parking. I quit smoking a long time ago. But for some reason, the cigarette smoke does not bother me. But I know that it would bother other patrons. If the smoke does bother you, then it is best to go on the patio. As I said earlier, I bought a t-shirt here. And when I went to put it on, it had that nightclub/dive bar cigarette smoke odor to it. Right into the wash it went. I will admit, the doors to the Hideaway are usually propped open to allow a breeze in and air the bar out, so that helps.\\nOther than the problems mentioned above, I really like this place. The service is prompt and friendly, and I never had any problem with anyone. It seems like everyone there is looking to relax and have a good time. The prices on both food and drink are reasonable.  \\nAnd if I see that the doors are open, that not only tells me that the staff is airing out the bar, but it tells me that everyone who enters is welcome. Before you enter though, make sure you have cash. No credit cards are accepted here.\\nNow I am thinking about cheese fries!"},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place because the sushi chefs can absolutely make everything!

All of my experiences are based on ordering some variation of a straight espresso and then that same espresso with milk.  Many times I am able to go into a business and order up a a one and one, because most coffee places split their shots out of the equipment they use.  But there are a few places I have gone where the split shot is not available, therefore I am unable to get the \\"one & one\\" one shot straight up with one shot milked to the level of a macchiato.  The ratio on that milked shot probably equals a half size Gibraltar.\\n\\nBut all that information is useless here.  Oracle is one of those places that doesn't have a split shot.  So instead I got my mouth on a nice tart and fruity double espresso.  It was a special blend that I didn't take note of.  It was very full of flavor and totally worth getting.   But I was also able to steal a small nip of my wife's \\"house stereo blend\\".  Great fruity beginning and ended on a dark chocolate note with just the right roasted finish.\\n\\nNext time I stop in, I will definitely be more prepared.  I will ask for a little stolen sip from my double shot, then I will let them fill it up with one of their many plant based milks.  So yes, only plant based milks here.  It's not my favorite, but usually, when businesses do this they make the concerted efforts to get the substitutes that best replace the regular experience.\\n\\nThe service was good and efficient and Portland friendly, and if anything they handled my road bleary self very professionally.  If you are planning on going here for coffee take into account the price of paying the parking meters on the street.  \\n\\nLot's of open space here, even on the busiest days I don't think this place would be uncomfortably crowded.

So flavorful you don't need soy sauce, just a dip in the chili sauce if you like spice.

After I arrived at the airport, the previous evening was spent in our spa robes, drinking champagne and eating a wild mushroom and truffle pizza, watching Passion of the Christ and trying to find a date for her bisexual cat. Apparently I put away three bottles of champagne and an assortment of cheeses before the night was done. Needless to say when I woke up...well, it felt like brunch time. \\n\\nWe arrived and told the hostess we had reservations. We had come a little early so we expected to spend some time at the bar. Then another hostess walked up and launched into her spiel about how there were no tables available and we can schlep the meal at the bar. We politely reminded her we had reservations and she apologized. We were seated within a few minutes. \\n\\nThe brunch seating reminded me of Taverna here in Austin, where we were practically rubbing elbows with a young attractive couple to my left and a group of semi-obnoxious college students to the right. In Austin, a few bottomless mimosas and the people next to you become your best friends, but I didn't get the impression that that was how it worked in New England. That's fine, the last time I made a new friend a brunch she was a wealthy woman who traveled the country with several inTouch magazines, eating at restaurants that stars were spotted at. Seriously. That's all she did. I was both impressed and envious of the bitch, but I digress. \\n\\nAtypically, alcohol did not sound like a cure all at the moment, so we ordered iced tea. It tasted a little weird to me (you know us Texans and our fresh brewed iced tea on demand), but when you cut it with lemon it was fine. Cornbread was exactly what I wanted when they set it down on the table. For starters, I wanted to try their breakfast tacos with creamy scrambled eggs and salsa and, of course, instantly compare it to the breakfast tacos I get at home on South Congress. Jen L. ordered deep fried short rib tamales (which have since been dropped from the menu). Bravo for presentation on Jen's! I especially loved how the tamale husks were arranged so pretty with the sauces. And I must say, my breakfast tacos were as good as any I've had at home. I had a bite of the tamales and they were simply fabulous. \\n\\nThe main course consisted of grilled skirt steak for me and Santa Fe style eggs Benedict on biscuits for her. I gotta tell you--I wasn't expecting much from the steak and eggs, but boy was I wrong. That was extremely succulent meat for a brunch steak and egg dish. It was melt in your mouth good. It came with about six scrambled eggs that may have heightened my cholesterol but decreased my need to clutch a bottle of Aleve and stay in bed. The home fries were so-so, but who cares? The meat was the star. Jen L. enjoyed her meal as well, and once again, great presentation too. \\n\\nAs for ambiance, it was warm and I had a feeling it would look awesome in the evening. I also had my back to the restaurant for most of the time, so I was more into the food. And having new Southwest in Boston was something different as well. And it's an EXCELLENT value to boot. This was definitely one of the more delicious brunches I've had.

Other than getting our orders, everything that happened afterwards was a little disappointing. My friends and I all ordered the Brunch Fiesta. She delivered half of our table's first course and forgot the other half's until we reminded her. Second course came a long while after, but I won't blame that on her. But seriously, I noticed as she was checking up on all the other tables around us, she didn't check up or even look once at our table. We were very dissatisfied. \\n\\nNonetheless, Brunch Fiesta is pretty delicious. I got to taste for the first course, the Plaintain Empanada and the Granola con Leche with Yogurt. I enjoyed the Granola con Leche because the yogurt was vanilla-sweet, but if I were to go again, I'd definitely order the Empanada. It was delicious. Nicely fried empanada with sweet plantain in the middle. MMMM. So good. \\n\\nFor the second course, I tasted the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros. Huevos Rancheros hands down if I ever visit again. The eggs benedict didn't have that much flavor and the southwestern biscuit was very doughy. I wasn't impressed. SO GET THE HUEVOS RANCHEROS.

We were greeted warmly when we entered.\\n\\nI ordered the blue corn pancakes with passion fruit butter (recommended by another Yelp! reviewer). The cakes were good but didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary; but the butter had a really nice flavor, and this is coming from someone who always disregards butter when having pancakes. My husband ordered the Mexican eggs benedict, and it was AMAZING. So good! This is a must-try. The flavor of every component on the plate made me completely forget that I don't like runny egg yolk. There's probably no way to say that I've been thinking about that dish since that day without sounding like a total creep. Ah well. It is what it is. Lol My chai latte was really good too, and it was served in a huge mug. I didn't end up finishing it. \\n\\nOur server was friendly and checked on us periodically. The manager checked on us as well.

After waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes, I was expecting (at the least) hot broth, perfectly cooked pork belly, and al dente fresh noodles. Broth was flavorful, yet somewhat lukewarm. Pork belly was about 90% fat, and I like my meat. Noodles were all right, although somewhat thin.\\n\\nThey redeemed themselves in my eyes though after trying their Katsu Slider (note the singular \\"slider\\", not sliders). It's a pretty good portion to share, but once you bite into it you'll wish you ordered your own. I'm not going to try to explain what it is because it wouldn't do it justice. \\n\\nOverall, great Katsu Slider - a definite 4 stars - but their ramen is in my opinion just a-ok, and the best you can get south of the Mason Dixon line..but then again that doesn't really say much."},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Big fan of this place.

It's obvious that you're going to pay more at an airport for a beer than you will most anywhere else (though some airport bars take it to the extreme), so I'm not going to go into detail about the prices, though these are a tad higher than some. What brings me into these types of places is the service.\\nMany airport eateries will have decent food, though it's often best to seek out known brands because they're more likely to have a semi-consistent standard of quality. I've never been to a Johnny Rivers before (or since), so I have no frame of reference, but everyone around me that ordered food seemed, at least, not to be displeased with their meal. One couple even seemed happy with it, though I doubt you'll find many singing the praises of anything located in an airport from any mountaintops at any point.\\nThe beer was large, served cold, in a clean glass, and was exactly what I ordered. The young lady who served it to me wasn't overly friendly, but neither was she overly distant, so it was fairly standard service overall.\\nThey have a couple different locations in the airport, so should I happen back through I'll most likely give another one a shot, though if it's the same or overcrowded or some-such, I wouldn't mind returning to grab a beer and sit on my phone with the rest of the travelers here."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Neat environment and staff we very friendly.

After waiting about an hour for a table (enjoying the delicious coffee while we did), we ate, and I quickly came to understand why we'd had to wait an hour. Best brunch I've ever had, and I say that in spite living in brunch-happy NYC. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is fairly simple, with a wide-open layout past the small bar by the door. A bar, I might add that is stocked with an ample supply of nice bourbons, but also knows how to mix a mean bloody mary. The open layout with somewhat sparse decoration gives it that mish-mash-of-conversations atmosphere, but at a volume level that doesn't interfere with your own tables' conversation. \\n\\nBut I digress. This is really all about the food. I got the fried oyster benedict. Wow. Incredible. Oysters were large, although actually not the best oysters I've ever had. But still, fried to perfection in kind of a cornmeal breading. The only real knock I could think of on the dish was that the hollandaise was pretty darn bland. Buttery, smooth and delicious-style bland. \\n\\nI sampled: \\nthe farm grits (hands-down the best grits I've ever had), \\nthe apple-and-pork sausage (straight up incredible - and try dipping it in a side of sausage gravy, because the more pig the better (c)), \\nthe praline bacon (kind of like a sweeter version of the more-common maple / brown sugar bacon), \\nthe cats head sandwich (we opted for calico. just kidding, there's no actual cat in it that I know of, but it included the best biscuit I've ever had),\\nthe chicken and waffle (wow, nearly the best fried chicken I've ever had...this list of \\"best of\\"'s is getting ridiculous!).\\n\\nAnyway, I'd say the side of apple and pork sausage is the can't -miss side option, but that's just saying it's the brightest star amongst many.

After two and a half years of searching around, I discovered Masa, and have since dubbed it the tastiest, coziest, and most unique brunch to be found in the Hub. Oh, and the best value, too! The $7.95 Saturday brunch menu is a steal - it starts out with two types of sweet cornbread, with three different jams/butters. One seemed to be a cinnamon butter of sorts, and the other two were fruit spreads (the mango spread on the golden-colored sweet cornbread was my favorite combo). Then, you get to choose an appetizer (yes, the $7.95 brunch includes a main course AND an appetizer!). I went with the fruit/granola over milk, which was nothing crazy, but good (the granola was fresh, very heavy on the nuts).

Anthony Bourdain gave it his seal of approval. We went in knowing it would be good. Here's the skinny: \\nVery Hungry Husband and I checked this out for a late dinner one night last month.\\nWe tried the ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, the collard greens and the macaroni & cheese.\\n\\nRibs: Good char on the ribs, not all that meaty, but a decent amount of meat on the bones. The ribs were sauced lightly, which I appreciated as I tend to like rubbed, smoked ribs better than the saucier version. Very Hungry Husband loves a lot of sauce on the meat, so he would have preferred even more. Meat outside had good flavor, inside was a little bland. Flavorful, properly seasoned and tender meat is key to good barbecue. The blandness of the meat inside is most likely because the ribs aren't exactly traditional barbecue ribs - more charbroiled, I think.\\nOver all the ribs were a B+ for me.\\n\\nPork Sandwich: WAY too sweet for me. If you like super sweet, candied barbecue, you'll be in hog heaven. The sweetness of the sauce on this was excessive and  the meat itself wasn't that tender or flavorful. Average bun, nothing else on sandwich to give it something extra, such as a sour pickle or acidic, creamy slaw to counter balance the sickly sweetness of the thing. A solid C for me.\\n\\nNow for the sides...\\n\\nCollard greens: Sweet and sour, vinegary seduction. Really, really good. Definitely deserving of an A.\\n\\nMacaroni & Cheese: I make a lot of homemade macaroni & cheese versions for the Very Hungry Husband and Always Hungry Offspring - they gobble up the stuff and have become quite the experts on the intricacies of a good macaroni & cheese. \\nFat Matt's hit it out of the park. Creamy with a bit of a tanginess - like sour cream perhaps. Not too much cheese, just the right amount, and seasoned properly.

However, I knew I had really liked their food the last time I had visited my brother in Arlington a few years ago and it was convenient to where I was staying this time, so I decided to go for it.  I was NOT disappointed.  The staff is very laid back and casual, casual to the point that the one and only waitress on duty was actually sitting at the counter drinking coffee and on her cell phone when I arrived.  I wasn't even sure if she was the waitress until she told me to take a seat anyplace I liked.  She immediately approached my table with a coffee cup and a pot of coffee.  Of course, it was exactly what I wanted, but I did kind of wonder how she knew that when I had yet to order.  Not everyone is a coffee drinker so I figured she must be psychic.  LOL.  \\n\\nI ordered the Country Eggs Benedict and a single pancake on the side.  The waitress warned me that it was going to be a lot of food, but it was around 11:00 a.m., I was starving so just said \\"bring it on\\"!  The Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious and the home fried potatoes were the best I've ever had, including my own.  A pancake is a pancake, nothing special there but I just needed a little bite of sweetness so the pancake with some syrup satisfied that craving. \\n\\nI'm so glad I decided to overlook some of the reviews I've read here about this place and decided to give it another try.

I liked the texture, though not actual meatballs and the spiciness of the chili peppers they added. The buns were soft brioche buns and not the typical baguettes you would get. However, I noticed the larger bahn mi's were actually made with a baguettes. I did not try so I cannot comment on it. Along with the trio, you get two shrimp chips which were addictingly good. \\n\\n-Savoury mini crepes ($6-2.5/5): They were nicely presented and very cute. It came scorching hot with a bowl of fish sauce on the side. The taste was rather disappointing. I tasted nothing. It was like eating plain dough and I tried added more fish sauce but still nothing. \\n\\n-Vietnamese iced coffee ($4-4/5): Unlike other places I've been to, they let you do the coffee dripping process yourself.

And I say caf√©, not coffee shop, for a good reason: It's got coffee, yes. It's got espresso too. And a plethora of milk choices I've never seen before (and I'm a coffee snob!) including coconut milk, rice milk, soy milk, and the whole gamut of cow's milk if that's your scene. But what I didn't discover until my second visit is that there's also a juice and smoothie bar, and all the fruit and veggies come from local organic sources. When I last went, on Saturday, the barista had made an early morning foray to the PSU Farmer's Market just to get Oregon strawberries and other goodies.\\n\\nThe friendly barista behind the counter sweet-talked me into a coconut latte - which was delightful even though I typically don't like lattes. It was just espresso and coconut milk (not to be confused with its cloying, near-unrecognizable derivative, coconut-flavored syrup, favored by Those Coffee Chains That Will Not Be Named) and it was so tasty I didn't even have to add sugar. I also had the world's most delicious pesto Panini, crispy and gooey with fancy-pants cheese - and sampled my vegan friend's vegan curry, which he wouldn't shut up about.\\n\\nIf I lived or worked around SE 12th/Morrison, this would become my neighborhood favorite - as it is I'll be making weekend treks to hang out in the cozy space in the back - giant comfy leather chairs, a couch, board games, a lending library and friendly staff make for the perfect lazy afternoon hangout.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"First of all, let me make clear that this review is for the new location at the Cobb County Braves Stadium, under the aegis of Terrapin Taproom, NOT the DeKalb Fox Bros. location.  THAT location gets five stars, hands down.  The new one?  Not so much.  \\n\\nUnless a game is about to happen, is happening, or has just let out, parking is no problem.  Finding the restaurant is a problem -- there's no directory in the parking garage or out in the Battery to let you know where the Taproom is located, so you have to wander and hope that you find it.  Good luck if you're in a wheelchair or your knees are bad! And we went on a Sunday, well after the crowds had cleared out post-game. \\n\\nAt the bar -- well, it's a Texas themed BBQ and it doesn't have Shiner Bock, the national beer of Texas?  To be fair, the mixed drinks they had were quite good, and they have their own rotating microbrewery beers.  But still.  The idea of brisket without Shiner is heresy.  No Lone Star or Corona, either.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very jangly.  There are multiple TV screens inside the restaurant, each on a different channel, so we sat outside -- but there it was no better.  The volume amped up, and we found that the interior TVs competed with at least three different *outdoor* screens.  It was very hard to have a conversation and to relax.  The \\"Battery\\" is aptly named -- it is sensory assault and battery.  We were very glad to leave.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was pleasant, but clearly taking a post-game break (in fairness, likely well-deserved!).  We were not offered refills on our water even though we needed them, and the waiter got the order incorrect.  Don't expect cutlery, real plates and bowls, or real glasses.  Our cocktails were served in plastic cups (!!), the water was in waxed cups, the sides were in styrofoam bowls,  and our meal came on tin trays covered with a thin paper napkin -- fine for a picnic outside or a fast food joint, but .... I suspect it was merely because of the volume of people trying to eat pre / post game, but still ... \\n\\nThe lean brisket was good -- not as flavorful as the downtown location, however, but still decent.  It came with generic sweet and spicy sauces -- pity nothing tangy, though that's better baked into the meat (why do places here add sauce *after* the 'cue is done instead of baking it in well?).  The salads were excellent, the baked beans and brisket chili up to Candler Park standards, and the sauerkraut decent.  The fatty brisket was not as tasty as the lean brisket, however, though it wasn't awful, and the pulled pork was inedible.  It was so greasy, salty,  and fatty that we sent it back.  The evening manager was wonderful, personable, and chatty; he explained that the folks doing the smoking and pulling were fairly new and inexperienced, and they didn't always get yet what would cook up perfectly.   It will come with time, I bet.  The location has a more limited menu than the Candler Park location, mainly because the cooks are still figuring out good 'cue.  \\n\\nThe venue had run out of stickers to validate our parking -- $20 otherwise! -- but another venue validated the parking stub for us based on our receipt, even though it wasn't supposed to do that.  It was very kind of it!  \\n\\nBasically, unless you are already going to the stadium for a game, are heading back into town, or live in the area, you're much better off going to the original Fox Bros.  Much better atmosphere, actual music, outside seating, experienced brisket smokers and meat pullers ... what's not to like?  This new location will likely get better as the cooks get more experience, but the downsides -- even hours post-game with few people there, the barrage of sound was overwhelming -- are enough that for me, if I am going to drive, I'll go to the original, thank you!"},{"name":"Nappi's Restaurant","address":"370 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Incredible, cozy Italian restaurant that has the most delicious, fresh Italian food I've ever had!

I ordered the smoked fish chowder, which reminded me of a Scottish Cullen skink, which was very good, but a bit too salty for my tastes. The service is apparently very fast, as we had our main dishes before I was half finished with my chowder, and I would have enjoyed being able to casually finish it. The main dish was the pig burger. It is topped with extremely delicious bacon, but you really can't taste it, or the beef, due to all sauces, gorgonzola cheese, toppings, and giant bun. A half pound of beef shouldn't feel lost.

And 1 biscuit and gravy- Kid you not, there were 2 biscuits in the gravy! Talk about magnanimous portion sizes. No regrets! Epic and awesome. My husband and I shared and in spite of sharing, I wish I could have unbuttoned my pants at the end of our meal. Like we had no room for dessert. \\n\\nSo considering the three massive chicken breasts offered, cooked to such perfection, I would have added another waffle. And a little more maple syrup. Otherwise the dish is pretty dry. So what I mean is if I were to consume this whole serving to myself, I would be drinking water, or coffee to wet my throat. It's not that the chicken or food is inedibly dry, the dish could do with a little more syrup or moisture content. This is where the biscuit was a great pairing. Onto the second piece, I was adding gravy from the biscuit. \\n\\nAlso, I wish they had a larger offering of coffee/tea. It was house coffee and I usually like a cappuccino/latte of some unique flavor. But please ignore my ultra perfect wish list. Screen door is a must try. Compared to tasty and alder where the portion size did not do justice to the price, here I am curious to know how they survive with the generous portions they offer. \\n\\nAlso, I gave it 4 stars, because the wait is ridiculous. 1 hour wait I get. But because, they are a popular place, they need to have people waiting outside, and there is no arrangement when it is pouring outside. Their restaurant entrance lacked breathing space, it was so packed with all those waiting and ordering a drink to kill time. And the bathroom line too.

During this visit I also ordered a side of 50/50 onion rings and fries ($4), with the cheese sauce added for $2. As I placed my TO GO order I asked the super friendly cashier how the fries were made, whether the cheese sause was of a shredded and melted over the top, or liquid, variety. He told me it was more of a liquid consistency, and when I asked if I could get the sauce on the side because I had a bit of a walk ahead of me he responded immediately, politely cutting me off, saying that they automatically put the cheese sause on the side to ensure that the fries wouldn't get soggy. I was super excited and pleased to hear this, and other wise would have just ordered a regular side of fries and saved my money had he not ensured me of this. Unfortunatelyyyy, and I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt on this miscommunication, when I got home I found a massive pile of soggy cheese and chive covered fries/onion rings at the bottom of my bag. On top of that, the cheese/chive sauce was extremely bland, and heavy to the point of nausea. I started to eat them, but basically just decided to toss the basket.

We ended up with 1/4 lb. lean brisket, 1/4 lb. fatty, 1 lb. of pork ribs, 1/2 lb. of pulled pork, 1/2 lb. of turkey, 2 links of sausage, single slaw, single potato salad, single beans, 1 banana bourbon pie.\\n\\nLater, while still in line, it began to really get hot. The employees of Franklin's continually came out to supply those waiting with a large water cooler filled with ice water, cold beers for sale, and umbrellas we could borrow to keep out of the sun. Much appreciated!\\n\\nUltimately, we sat down to eat around 1pm (so a 5hr wait in total). What can I say? The food was delicious! Both the lean and fatty brisket were very moist, ribs were peppery and tender, sausages were slightly spicy (in a good way) and had a great casing snap when you bit into it. The pulled pork was tasty, but not my favorite; I probably wouldn't order it again. The quiet star though was the turkey! VERY moist and peppery, and slightly smokey. The money I put down on the pulled pork I would transfer for more turkey.\\n\\nSides tasted good, but paled in comparison to the main meats. Banana bourbon pie was awesome, that's the one I would recommend.\\n\\nIf it's your first time going to Franklin's, I would recommend sampling everything. If I were to order again, I'd probably get fatty brisket, ribs, sausage, and turkey along with beans and the banana bourbon pie. \\n\\nAs far as cost goes, all of the food previously mentioned in addition to two shirts and two fountain drinks, ran about $110."},{"name":"Burger & Beer Joint","address":"11662 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Bland burgers and bland staff.

I was there first and stood in the line that was not bad (photo) and it moved nicely.  Mike showed up and we stood there talking and then a couple came up behind us in line and the conversation grew.  Very nice people and they gave me some great info on other places in Austin to try and I gave them my faves for here in San Antonio.  They were very polite.\\n   We make it into the restaurant after about 30 minutes and we were greeted by one of the owners and given a menu.  He took time to explain the menu and is a very kind person.  Patient as well, my friend will asks all sorts of questions.  ha ha.  I asked him to suggest a bowl and he said the #1 Original and to order extra meat.  I did just that and also purchased the corn bomb I think is what it's called.  He directed us where to sit and went to greet others.\\n     We made our order and sat down at the end of the tall bar on some cool stools.   Our food was promptly brought out and it looked amazing (photos).  I tried mine without any additional flavoring and was so impressed on the richness of the broth and the overall combination of ingredients.  I'm a happy man.  The owner came back around and checked on us and I had to share a hug with the guy.  I like this alot and told him I would be back.  We spoke a bit more and Mike mentioned that I cook alot and make gumbo and the owner said he had not had some in along time.  So I told him I would bring some fresh gumbo the next time I plan on returning.  \\n   We were both very happy.\\n  I highly suggest taking a trip to Austin to try this little place, yes, it's tiny.  Limited seating but we were told it is not always so busy.  Just hit or miss on the busy days, but it's worth the wait should you get in a line.

And this coming from a boy raised in a taiwanese family. Its nice being able to find authentic taiwanese food here in atlanta. \\n\\nSo i went with 2 friends, we got 3 dishes, the 3 cup chicken, the tofu and fish house special, the pig intestine hot pot, and the 3 bean ice dessert. My friends, being white, didnt enjoy the pig intestine hot pot as much as i did... BUT WHO CARES!!! if your a real asian TRY IT. its jsut as good or better here than any other taiwanese restaurant I've been to (and I've been to a ton in atlanta, New Jersey, NYC, and Cali). \\n\\nSo the dishes, The 3 cup chicken was a little sweeter than i expected, but full of flavor, and most importantly, very very moist. What was weird was that it was boneless chicken (i guess they have to dumb it down a little bit for the non asians). good seasoning, and good sauce, I'd say i would have like it to be a little bit less sweet. Overall still a signature dish that tastes awesome and that anyone can like.\\n\\nThe fish and tofu house special was especially nice, I was worried tey would be using crappy tillapia to make it, but thank god they didnt. They used cod i think. It was flaky, flavorful, and held its texture well, the tofu and hot sause it was served in perfectly complemented it. To be honest it kinda reminded me of mau puo tofu, except with juicy tender fish instead of ground pork or beef. \\n\\nThe pig intestine hot pot, now THATS the dish i've been waiting for. and to be honest, it def held up. in fact, i think i like the style they have here over the style they make it with at my favorite restaurant. They have more sauce in it than I'm used to, but that was a good thing, more flavor to bled with my rice. there was plenty of pig intestine and blood cubes, and in fact, for 9 dollars, its a great deal. I loved it. good flavor, the blood cubes were the exact right consistency, and the intestine wasnt too chewy or tough (it was nice and soft). \\n\\nthe dessert, omg, that was amazing, so amazing i ate half myself, and there is a WHOLE LOT. tasted good, authentic, beans were cooked thoroughly, plenty of ingredients and toppings. My friends werent so crazy about this dish, but hey wat can you say, theyre crazy white folk. For me, having grown up on this, i'd say it was pretty friggen good. not the best, but id say in the top 5 that i've had. \\n\\nThe thing about this place is that its so cheap for what your getting.

Didn't take any pictures of the plates, which you share tapas-style as they come out, but included an image of the menu from the night we ate there.  This is what we ordered and how I would rate each dish on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being best:\\n\\nBalsamic marinated castelvetrano olives, smoked pork fat, spruce, chili flake (SCORE: 7.5) - Beautifully presented in an olive boat bowl with the manliest toothpicks you've ever seen.  Good savory flavor, and a nice starter.\\n\\nPulled pork, miso pancake, smoked korean BBQ sauce, apple, crispy onion (SCORE: 9) - An outstanding fusion of flavors.  Could've eaten this & the asparagus all night.\\n\\nAsparagus, deviled egg aioli, crispy mushroom, parmesan flakes, pine oil (SCORE: 10) - Perfectly cooked asparagus that's perfectly complemented by the creamy aioli underneath.  Outstanding.\\n\\nFoie gras mousse, candied pistachio, apple crumb, quince syrup, toasted milk powder (SCORE: 8.5) - How could this strange combination work?  I don't know, but it did.  A rich and delicious must have.\\n\\nWarm kale salad, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, buttermilk onions, lemon parm (SCORE: 8) - First kale dish of any kind anywhere that I actually loved.\\n\\nBurger 2.0, aged cheddar, bacon, garlic dill pickles, alfalfa, gulf islands dressing (SCORE: 7) - A gourmet burger, but honestly, nothing extraordinary.  The alfalfa did not complement it either.\\n\\nMilk chocolate pudding, marshmallows, cookie pieces, banana, milk ice cream (SCORE: 8) - I'm not a big marshmallow fan, but based on other reviews I read, this was the dessert to try.  Definitely tasty, rich, and a pleasant finisher.\\n\\nOn top of everything else, because of the favorable exchange rate, the overall bill was a bargain.

I LOVE bbq, and have eaten its native variety all around the world.  I am the rib-off queen.  I will admit that Memphis-style is my favorite, but that shouldn't have been a problem here.  I'd say everything I tasted except the corn bread was bad to inedible.  The baked beans were horrific and tasted of little other than smoke--I had to add 3 tbsp of my favorite bottle bbq sauce to make them edible.  The coleslaw was inedible, and seemed to be just vinegar and cabbage.  The pickles were so bad I had to spit them out.  The babyback ribs were incredibly tough and tasteless, a waste of ribs.  The pulled pork was dressed in what I believe is a North Carolina-style, vinegar-based sauce, which isn't in itself bad, but I was not a fan of the formulation.  The corn bread was sweet and cake-like, and was the only good thing about the meal.  \\n\\nI'm so sad to have psyched myself up for yummy bbq when I was presented with this crime against tastebuds.

This place....bubbly hot cheesy deliciousness! \\n\\nWe've made 3 attempts to go here, but each time there was a crazy wait, and we didn't want to wait because I'm one of those people that get's grumpy hungry, or \\"hangry\\" if I wait to long to eat. Seriously, I can get pretty mean. We went early enough this time, and had about a 15 minute wait, but had to sit at the bar. This is not my favourite thing to do if I'm going with someone and there's a chance there will be multiple shared dishes. There just isn't the space on a counter for that sort of  thing. Two out of the three times we've  wanted to come it was bar seating only so we opted to go elsewhere for that very reason. Anyway, this time we said screw it, we're going to sit at the bar. I wouldn't want to sit there again, but I'm glad we finally tried this place!\\n\\nWe started with the guacamole for $7. It was quite good, but I felt it need a bit more salt and lime to bring out the flavours, but damn good just the same. They did provide a wedge of lime, so that helped. They also make their own tortilla chips that it's served with on the side, those were really good too! They were a bit shy with the chips, but I'm sure we could have gotten a few more if we'd asked. \\n\\nWe then had Queso Fundido $15 - molten cheese fondue served in a volcanic rock molcajete. Your choice of Mexican chorizo or salsa verde on top. We chose the chorizo. It comes with corn tortillas. SO DELICIOUS!!! The cheese is bubbling hot and in the process of caramelizing on the inside of the bowl when it's placed in front of you, and the tortillas are used to load in all that bubbling cheese and chorizo. Amazing!!! Also, very very filling. I think next time I will try the salsa verde simply to cut down on the caloric intake! Eating that will require an extra 1.5 hours of cardio for sure! The next item was Parillada $19 - Grilled beef short-ribs marinated in  pasilla chile sauce. Served with Mexican chorizo, nopalitos, toreado peppers and green onions. This was also excellent. A little pricey for what it was, I think $17 would have been a more appropriate price point personally. Still delicious though. \\n\\nIn terms of drinks, I just had a Pacifico $6, and my man just had a Mexican soda of some sort as he was driving. They have quite a few cocktails, most have Tequila or Mezcal in them of course. I no longer drink the stuff (getting goosebumps even thinking of the smell of it *shiver*) but you can get other stuff too. I didn't see any wine on the menu, and they used to have Sangria, but not anymore. Sadness. \\n\\nThe service we had sitting at the bar was great. The fellow that was attending to us was smokin' busy. Not only was he making his own drinks, taking food orders and serving them, it appeared he was also keeping an eye on another bartender there who must have been new, as he was testing her drinks to make sure they were good or she was asking him questions. All this, and friendly, and kept an eye on our drinks. They were all working hard, but he was really busting his ass, and right on top of things. We got our bill quickly and paid in a decent amount of time after we received it. \\n\\nIf you haven't gone here, GO. I'd suggest perhaps not going on a weekend night if you can. Might help to avoid the busy line up, as well as  having to sit at the bar side by side with the person you might be sharing several plates with. Molten cheese is not easy to deal with when sitting side by side and close to other people around you. I just find it awkward, but that could just be me. Also, I'm not sure about reservations -  I *think* they will do them for parties of 6 and over. Best to check if you're going with a group.\\n\\nOverall, I like this place, and will be back to try more things....Ceviche is next on my list!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm a big food guru guy and love food.

In other words, I had to wait three plus hours starting at ten in the morning for a Franklin's lunch. But lawdy, was it worth it! \\n\\nFirst off, you have to hand it to the owner, Aaron Franklin. Even with a SXSWer-crazed line wrapped around the block, Mr. Franklin makes a point to stay true to himself. He doesn't allow anyone else to cut the meat and always seems to find time and energy to chat with the customer while they order. So though my tummy was dancing an angry cha-cha after waiting so long, by the time I got to the counter to order from him, I was immediately charmed. His cool attitude and inquiry into my day's plan as well as my first glimpse of my promised meat meal put even my tummy's dancing monsters at ease. \\n\\nThere is something extremely special about meals that can be served on a paper plate and eaten with plastic utensils and still send you to the holiest of happy food places. It seems every meal at Franklin's does just that. I am so very happy to report that the brisket lives up to all of its hype. It's juicy, tender, beautiful goodness. And though it doesn't require sauce, it does even more marvels when accompanied by the vinegar-based bbq sauce. And the ribs! Though the brisket seems to get the most attention and praise, it would be a great dishonor to not consider the fall-off-the-bone ribs. It's of the stuff that makes vegetarians carnivores. \\n\\nThe coleslaw, beans, and white bread accompaniments put the biggest, most succulent cherry on top of the best southern meal I've ever had.

(Since the news indicated that nearly the entire 78702 ZIP code went dark, I'm assuming Mettle's power was knocked out, too.) I was worried when I made my original reservation online that the owners of this place might have an attitude problem -- included in my confirmation email was a statement that they would give our table away if we were FIVE minutes late, which I don't recall ever seeing elsewhere (and the primary reason I'm giving Mettle four stars, not five, for what was otherwise a lovely dinner) -- but when we arrived, yes, five minutes late, and the rest of our party was 15 minutes late, we encounter nary an iota of objection. (Instead, our server nicely took our drink order while we waited.) The rest of our meal proceeded similarly, with nary a single bump in service.\\n\\nThe interiors at Mettle have some, er, mettle. This should be no surprise to anyone who's been to one of owner Bridget Dunlap's many Rainey St. bars, but Mettle kicks things up a notch. It's difficult to give a place with literally warehouse-height walls a feeling of intimacy, but Mettle achieves it while at the same time taking full advantage of the building's soaring ceilings. The overall design is industrial with more than a touch of '60s glam, albeit rendered on a dark palette. At this point I'm afraid I have to strenuously disagree with Robert S. review a few days ago about Mettle's supposed \\"pretentiousness,\\" which appears to be rooted solely in Mettle's admittedly \\"still-gentrifying\\" location. First of all, the service isn't \\"pretentious\\" in the least, and the only thing even *mildly* pretentious about the menu was the prices for a few items ($31 for a pork chop is a bit steep, even if it's organically fed). Secondly, I'd argue that judging a restaurant by its surroundings, as Robert S. does, is as pretentious as it gets, so if neighborhood is really that important to you, you'd probably be happier in less-gritty Clarksville at, say, Jeffrey's.\\n\\nBoth of the dishes I ordered were outstanding, though I admittedly chose ones that Yelpers had recommended. The thought of eating beef tongue tacos might be hard at first, but I promise they're great! (and virtually indistinguishable from \\"regular\\" meat) I'm a stickler for fried chicken, as I've noted in earlier reviews, but the meat served here is sublime, with a thick, non-greasy crust and excellent flavor. Finally, although we weren't seated there, if only because a large party had reserved a 24-top setting, the patio is quite nice, and this time of year is particularly excellent for al fresco dining."},{"name":"No Mas!

Ramen Tatsu-Ya makes the other kind and it's delicious.\\n\\nThe old school ramen is the staple here and it comes with a reasonably sized slice of pork belly, a half of a smoked (or maybe pickled) egg, firm soba noodles, and delicious shaved mushrooms all in a broth that is so creamy and thick that it doesn't really seem like broth anymore.\\n\\nThe decor inside is stylized samurai meets plywood. It's a bit odd, but it's grown on me the more I've gone. That combined with the rush to get people in and out of the restaurant makes it maybe not the best date spot though. It's not that they'll ever rush you, but just that you can see the line and start feeling guilty.\\n\\nIn addition to the ramen, they have \\"bombs\\" which can you add to you meal. The spicy bomb is my favorite and it's basically a house-made sriracha sauce that just adds some spectacular extra flavors. I've also gotten the fire in a bowl bomb and that one is good, but it was spicier than I thought complemented the food and I'm normally the person begging for more spicy.\\n\\nThe side dish of the brussel sprouts was almost as good as the ramen itself and I don't think I'm going to make it back without ordering it again. The edamame (boiled soy beans) are good, but not significantly better than you can buy frozen in the grocery store and heat up yourself in the microwave.\\n\\nA few words of warning. The lunch menu and dinner menu are different and even the broth is different. It's chicken-based during lunch and beef-based during dinner. I prefer the dinner broth, but you should try both if you can. Also the spicy bomb is only available during dinner, which is sad.\\n\\nLastly, this place fills up fast and it's pretty easy to have to wait for 30 minutes or more if you show up in the middle of dinner. If you hate waiting show up as they open and you shouldn't have any problem. There also seems to be very little wait during lunch."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So great!

Mexican food is my favorite cuisine and I was very excited (to say the least) about the opportunity of trying a new Mexican restaurant--frequent flyer at On the Border and La Parilla.  Before I left to go the restaurant, I went to their website to look up directions and to my surprise it said, \\"Complimentary valet Thursday through Saturday.\\"\\n\\nFalse.\\n\\nAs we pulled up to the restaurant the sign said that valet was $2.  I have no problem paying for valet; however, I do not like being blatantly lied to.  There were no special events that night either.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is very pretty--prolific decorations, lots of indoor and outdoor seating with a big bar, and a few families.  We had a big party and got seated upstairs (after 75% of our group showed up).  We ordered a few pitchers of margaritas (~$30 each) which came in beautiful tall vase-like glass pitchers.  The margarita itself was a little too sweet for my taste; I prefer a little bit more of a zing.\\n\\nFor my main course I ordered the Burrito Grande.  This meal, or the equivalent, is what I generally order at Mexican restaurants.  When I received my plate the presentation was nice, two halves of the burritos cut and leaning against each other with the rice and beans.  I took my first bite into the burrito--all rice.  Okay, thinking to myself, I can't wait for the Chipotle peppers, meat, queso, and  lime sauce!  Next bite--all rice.  Rice. Rice. Rice. Rice.  Really?  I pretty much ordered a plate of rice.  Yes, there were chunks of meat, a few scattered peppers, and some beans, but I would have rather have gone for a Willy's or Chipotle burrito. No joke.\\n\\nAfter going through three or four bites of my burrito, extremely disappointed and confused, I inquired the waitress about the missing ingredients in my burrito (okay, they were there if you used a microscope!).   Very nicely she pointed to the side of my plate (to the pico de gallo) and said that is what they were talking about on the menu and offered some shredded cheese, since according to her, that was the only thing missing.  The menu clearly states what the flour tortilla is stuffed with and what comes served with the meal.  \\n\\nSeveral other people were disappointed with their food, although the people that got enchiladas seemed happy.\\n\\nOverall, the decorations and ambiance of the establishment is very nice but I will never elect or recommend anyone to dine at this restaurant.\\n\\nTldr; No mas isn't only for the name of the restaurant.........."},{"name":"Nosh On Seventh","address":"2030 SE 7th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite little lunch place has been discovered!

There was an interesting mix of people - mostly late 20s and older. As we were leaving as a huge group of younger people came in. We met the owner (Bill? I think he name was) who was nice. As we were leaving we were actually going to talk to him about a few suggestions but he seemed to have some friends at the bar so I've resorted to yelp.\\n\\nThe decor is so entirely different than Our House (what used to be there) It's amazing. It's very nice inside, definitely reminds me of PF Changs. Their website lists this as traditional Chinese dinner - that is a complete lie. I would like you to show me a traditional Chinese dinner with crab rangoon - please. There's nothing wrong with the American Chinese food - just don't false advertise (especially in a city where we have Chinatown and know what real Chinese food is)\\n\\nFor the food we tried out a bunch of food: lettuce wraps, duck buns, pork belly buns, the shrimp skewers and the fish entree. \\n\\nOverall the flavors of the food were great but the execution left something to be desired. The shrimp tasted like they were frozen (we do live next to an ocean - shrimp shouldn't be frozen) however their flavor was great. The pork belly needed to be braised for much longer - it was very chewy and hard to eat. The duck was a strange texture, it was like ground duck which was okay just kind of strange at first. Both types of bun were just the bun, meat and a small piece of lettuce, I think some extra flavoring even it's just a small amount of fresh herbs would make it look nicer and less like Teriyaki Joe's take out buns (they actually went out of business) Lettuce wraps were an exact replica of PF Changs - come on Shanghai Social Club lets try and be creative a bit with the menu. The fish was impossible to eat with chop sticks. Its nice that they're trying to be \\"authentic\\" with the chop sticks but when serving a thick chunk of fish it's impossible to eat it. We actually mentioned it to our server (who was great by the way) and she awkwardly laughed and said \\"Yeah its kind of hard to eat but its sooo good, right?\\" She also told us all entrees were for sharing - the fish was good for us since we had eaten a ton of food before that, but it definitely is not big enough to be considered a sharing entree. \\n\\nThe drinks were okay, typical tiki type drinks. They did have a full bar so I would be interested to see how good the bar tenders are at some of the classics. It would be nice to see some more creative craft cocktails that are less about fruit juice and more about interesting flavor combinations. (Think Deep Ellum craft cocktails with an Asian flair?)\\n\\nThe space is great - Allston needed more places to bring large group of people. I could see this being a great place to take a large group before going out to bars.\\n\\nThe service was great - a few small issues but they are all learning the menu still so that is fine. \\n\\nI think there is a lot of potential for Shanghai Social Club but definitely some things they need to address. The food either needs to step up a notch or everything should be reduced by 1$. Although Bon Chon is Korean & Sushi there are some similar menu items and Shanghai Social Club is falling short compared to Bon Chon (which is right down the road and does have beer and wine so is probably their #1 competitor) \\n\\nWe will come back because I have high hopes and I want this place to succeed as its right next to our apartment. \\n\\nOh and I just remembered - the menu is NOT vegetarian or vegan friendly. The only veg. options are veggie fried rice or the soup.

The barbecue is top-notch, and has a savory smoky flavor.  They have excellent, tangy sauce, and they don't patronize the customer by slathering their meat in it before serving; they offer it on the side as default, because they know you, the barbecue connoisseur, knows the importance of the flavor of the meat by itself, and let you decide just how much sauce, if any, is needed.\\n\\nTheir ribs are the definition of \\"fall-off-the-bone,\\" as holding any rib will show you the effectiveness of gravity as the pork will gently slide right off of it.  My favorite is still the BBQ sandwiches that are an absolute steal of a bargain, offered all the time, that come with chips, and the added drink will still have you being contented for well under $10.\\n\\nI actually feel sorry for the neighboring Subway restaurant.  Like a jealous ex-boyfriend, they must have to watch the lines stretch out the door of Fat Matt's at their peak times, and watch hungry defeated patrons crawl into their doors just looking for a cheap appetite suppressant.  Sorry Jared, a Five-Dollar FootlongÔøΩ?is no match for a Fat Matt's BBQ sandwich.  All they can really do is bitterly put up signs that says adjacent parking spaces for SUBWAY CUSTOMERS ONLY.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the one flaw of the establishment - space.  Fat Matt's is so good, they're often packed beyond capacity.  Both in the parking lot, where there are barely enough legal and illegal spots to park perhaps 15 cars at max.  And then the interior of the place, aside from its delicious smoky aroma is set up with a few tables, some 4-top, and a few long tables, so if you have qualms with sitting next to a total stranger, get over it, or forfeit delicious barbecue.\\n\\nOften times, Fat Matt's has live jazz/blues music on their tiny stage to croon while you stuff your faces.  This has never been seen as a bad thing in my opinion.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Fat Matt's is a must-eat for anyone who hasn't been there before.

Once we revealed that we had no reservation, we were shuttled out to the patio despite there being a massive downpour outside.  OK, whatever.  You do what you have to do (although I think they could have made room inside).  \\n\\nThe thing that stands out most is that the service really sucked.  Our server seemed pretty good at first (if a bit overeager to take our order, almost to an annoying degree).  I asked for the fried okra I had read about in all the reviews, which was mysteriously not on the menu.  With great fanfare, the server assured me with great fanfare that HE could make it happen for ME!  *gasp!*  \\"Cool! Thanks, man.\\"  Once he took our order and brought us reasonably tasty biscuits and corn muffins, service quickly went downhill.  \\n\\nEverything came out pretty fast, except for the fried okra.  I gently reminded him about it and he seemed a bit surprised, like he didn't remember me ordering it (and the big deal he made about making sure he got some for me).  OK, fine, he forgot.  Whatever.  So we continued to eat until the meal was finally over.  Still no fried okra.  I asked about it again, and again was met with total surprise....kind of a \\"duh\\" moment but still no recognition that he'd even taken the order in the first place, no apologies, no nothing (it was like ordering food from that guy in \\"Memento\\").  I found this really weird.  His bizarre reaction made me feel like I was the crazy one.  I just want some god#@$% fried okra.\\n\\nAfter waiting for another 10 minutes, we eventually got the okra (obviously fresh out of the fryer); it was fried nicely but really not seasoned at all.  The host (maybe the MOD also?) cleared some of our plates, tried to upsell the hell out of us on some after dinner aperitifs (no thanks), and then took a dessert order, seeing as how our dimwitted server had disappeared yet again.  As soon as the host went away to put in the order, the server came back and asked if we'd like dessert.  Sigh.\\n\\nWhile the service was pretty dismal, I'll concede that the food wasn't too bad, but honestly, it could have been much better (to match the high prices).  Fried green tomatoes were tasty but a little odd (they had goat cheese in them - yum, but huh??).  Had the \\"legendary\\" shrimp and grits and it was decent (hardly legendary though).  The grits were a bit stiff, like they'd been sitting out in the plate awhile and gotten cold.  Fail on that one.  My dining companions both had the trout special, no complaints there (but also no compliments or \\"Damn! this is good\\"s).  My $10 glass of wine tasted like it came from a bottle that had been open for a few days.  Laaaame.\\n\\nOur trip was \\"meh\\" at best, and I will not be returning.   And I'll probably complain loudly if it comes up in future \\"Where should we eat?\\" conversations with friends.  NOT a love connection."},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Revival was an incredible dining experience.

Those sides were magnificent - mac & cheese, asparagus, cornbread, collard greens, fingerling potatoes, and grits. I got the fried chicken entree and loved it and my colleague ordered the meatloaf. I don't even like meatloaf and I ate half of hers it was so good!  We capped it off with fried strawberry pie (to die for) and the icebox lemon cake (amazing).

Regular readers of my reviews know that I am a stickler for good, fresh french fries, which this place did not provide.  But, knowing that to be the case, I went with the mashed potatoes and gravy as my side, which were good.  \\n\\nI hoped there would be beef ribs at this place, and there were not, which was disappointing.

All there sauces were ok, but none were great.  However, they have enough selection that will probably fit your tastes.\\n\\nAs my appetizer, I had the 'southern fried' chicken wings, which will satisfy a craving for fried food, but aren't anything special on their own.  I also had the chili, which was very special on its own.  I'm pretty sure they used brisket for the chili rather than ground beef and it shows.

And to anyone complaining about price: the outrageous cost of halibut is not Pajo's fault. Halibut is now a luxury and extremely expensive no matter where you get it. And, to be fair, Pajo's charges LESS than many other places offering halibut, which many no longer bother to do, due to the high cost. If you want cheaper F&C, order cod. If you want the best of the best, splurge a little and get the halibut. It is absolutely divine!\\n\\nThis would be a five-star review based solely on my first visit, because everything about my halibut and chips was absolute fish and chip perfection (and I am very fussy about my fish and chips!). Price is very reasonable, bottomless soft drinks are only $1 (!) with a food order, and the food is exactly what I want it to be. Crisp golden batter on beautiful halibut and fresh-cut delicious fries. \\n\\nHowever, on my second visit the halibut was very dry. I mean so dry as to be unenjoyable and disappointing. While I was eating it I was remembering how much better it had been on my previous visit (which was only a month or so earlier). If it's that bad next time I will take it back. Pajo's was extremely busy at this visit, line-up to order and lots of people waiting for their orders, so I didn't bother.\\n\\nStill, though, in my estimation, you would have to look far and wide to find better fish and chips than Pajo's.

It's right around the corner from my house, which makes it the most convenient, affordable lunch spot.\\n\\nBut that doesn't mean I enjoy eating here. Boca Grande is the most consistently mediocre taqueria I know of-- I would even go to Chipotle over this place, if I had a choice. Maybe it's gone downhill lately... that could be part of it. In order to have the best possible burrito here, I peek over the counter to see which meat looks freshest, then choose that one. Nine times out of ten, even that one is old-tasting, with loads of cartilage and fat chunks involved. Clearly low-grade reject meat. The salsa is usually week-old tasting, a little like garbage and lacking flavor. Decent rice, decent beans, gummy flour tortillas.\\n\\nIt is not hard to put together a great burrito-- fresh, half-decent ingredients are key. Boca Grande succeeds in this about one in five times.\\n\\nYour best bets are the tamales, then after that the enchiladas, although with the enchiladas you have to endure their sub-par meat.\\n\\nIf you order tacos, don't expect to get beans, rice, and chips on the side like a normal taqueria. And if you want their shitty cold chips to scoop up the stuff, expect to pay two bucks for them.\\n\\nAfter living next door for two years now, I can honestly say that I hate Boca Grande. Unfortunately it's a little like hating United Airlines; you continue to patronize them strictly for convenience and affordability. But at this point I can only make it halfway through one of their burritos before I have to throw it away out of disgust.\\n\\nGo to Tacos Lupita if you want better.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The only thing this place is missing is a wheelbarrow so that a loved one can cart you home after your stuff yourself silly.\\n\\nI came to Atlanta with high expectations for the barbecue scene, and I'm not a person who's inclined to be charitable to restaurants. But the food is just too damned good. The half rack of ribs are so tender that the meat practically falls off of them if you touch them the wrong way, and yet by the standards of barbecue they're not too greasy. They're just really good ribs, and the sauce is perfect for just about every set of taste buds: tangy, but not spicy, and a little sweet, but not too sweet. Considering that it comes at $19 and that includes a couple of sides, it's more than a fair deal.\\n\\nOn top of that, the service is really good. I went at 5:15 on a Saturday and the joint was hopping, but I still managed to sit at the bar, and once I got there, I was able to eat quickly. The wait time between placing my order and wolfing down their ribs was better than I've had in some fast food restaurants. This place might be busy, but they know how to serve people quickly and efficiently."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I will provide a TL;DR at the end of this review.\\n\\nI stopped in here because I heard about the chef some long time ago, and saved this location in my bookmarks. It fell into that abyss which is my bookmark list. At some point, I was looking for a great burger, and found this place. Something was reawakened, and I decided to stop in here yesterday. \\n\\nWhile I do hope to return at some point to try some of their very creative sounding cocktails, and while I was satisfied with my meal, there were some points which cost this place two stars.\\n\\nIt is definitely interesting that you have a choice of still or sparkling water (at no extra charge). \\n\\nNow, instead of giving you bread before your meal, they give you house-pickled green beans. This was quite a lovely contrast to the bread restaurants usually give. I will, however, offer one microscopic criticism. While most of the green beans could be eaten whole, there were one or two where the stem was still attached. Be aware of this if you are here with company. Spitting these things out in front of company can be... a bit awkward.  \\n\\nFor a drink, I ordered their rotating dark draught beer. This time it was Brooklyn Black Ops - Bourbon Barrel aged beer. Being an Imperial Stout, it is strong, heavy stuff, but the taste isn't overly bitter. Flavor profile (for me, anyway) has chocolate, coffee, and some very faint dark cherry notes. I would also like to mention that the quantity provided is between 10-12oz. The glass does not have those little lines that measure the quantity. \\n\\nFor a meal, I ordered the Secret Burger (I took it on faith) with some of the 3-onion dip on the side. \\n\\nFirst, I would like to talk about the 3-onion dip (and chips) for a bit. The dip was $3, and went spectacularly well with the potato chips that come with the burger. Here is the interesting thing though... on the snack part of the menu you can get this dip with chips, and it costs $8. So, based on photos from other Yelpers, while there is a solid amount of potato chips in this snack, they are charging $5 for them. They may be house-made, and they are quite good with a balanced salt content, but they are not a whole lot more spectacular than Cape Cod brand. \\n\\n...As for the dip, there was definitely a solid amount of it there, and it was quite good, but not oniony enough for me. It had a pleasant texture, and a slight sweetness found in caramelized onions (and French Onion Soup). However, for a dip called 3-onion, I was expecting more onion.\\n\\nNow, the part you've all been waiting for. The secret burger... while it was pretty good, it was not as spectacular as I expected. The bun was good, it was solid, meaning it did not fall apart from the burger being handled and eaten. As for the toppings, there was something which added a wonderful crispness to the burger. Other Yelpers say this is a cheese crisp, I am not sure, but I will defer to their wisdom. There was also some shredded lettuce and pickles on the burger. This definitely was a great combination of fresh, picked, crispy, meaty, and bready.\\n \\nWhile the lettuce was present throughout, the pickles were a bit inconsistent. Some bites got more than others. As for the meat, while it was cooked medium (I think) my concern with it is that there were some pieces that were a little on the chewy side... If you've read my reviews, you'd know I'm a stickler for consistency.\\n\\nOrdered German Chocolate Cake for dessert. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment. The reality is not quite as delicious as the description implies. You get some chocolate mousse, a little bit of cherry, some white chocolate bark, and three pieces of chocolate cake that somewhat resembled Entenmann's little bites, chocolate brownie. If they were warm, it would be better, but they weren't. This dessert is not worth the $11 or $12 dollars it costs. \\n\\nOkay, a couple more points:\\n\\n\\nLocation is clean, dimly lit, and cool. A nice place to bring a date. Not very divey though.\\n\\nService was nice and attentive, water glass didn't go empty. Wait was average, not outrageously long, but not wicked quick either. It was close to opening time, so that might have something to do with it. \\n\\nPlace is quite popular! Making a reservation might just be a good idea!\\n\\nBurger has limited availability, if you want one, come earlier. \\n\\n\\nThe promised TL;DR...\\n- Nice location with good service, wait not too bad. \\n- Nice beer/cocktail menu\\n- Chips and dip good, but not spectacular, and overpriced\\n- Burger definitely solid, good flavor combinations but not the greatest, and some minor consistency issues. \\n- Avoid the German chocolate cake, mediocre flavor, and poor value."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"2038 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Fucking dank and affordable.

I can't comment on that as I have never seen him there.  At all my visits, I've been attended to by a very friendly and able  group of young  people.  \\n\\nI like the spare and natural-looking decor (wood, bamboo) and find it very refreshing and relaxing.  The decor here would not be unusual or even noteworthy in Portland, but in the restaurant's location in a strip mall, the decor does stick out.  I usually have one of the bento boxes served in the very pretty and intriguing boxes (for some reason, I'd like to stick one in my purse after eating and sneak out the door with it - guess I should just buy one for myself).   The tempura is delicate and nicely done, salad is a crispy side note, and rice and main entree item always tasty.  Sushi super, super good.  I love their sauces.  Water glass is topped off frequently and any questions are answered promptly.  \\n\\nThe only drawback to this restaurant for me is the distance (Goose Hollow to Vancouver), so when friends and I do come, we make sure we have plenty of other things to do over in that area so we can be truly hungry and ready for a fine lunch or dinner.

The ambiance is very nice.  Old floodlights are now used as ceiling lamps, nice wooden tables, dark and sexy atmosphere all the way.  Except the walls, they feel like a middle school bathroom, but whatever I don't care as long as the food and service are good.  Hence, 3 stars.  Our server seemed to disappear throughout the night, even though we had given the indications that we were ready to leave or needed a drink.  If I wasn't a server myself, I wouldn't be so harsh about this, but I am so... I am.  The drinks were good.  I got the Lion's Den which had a very nice taste and balance to it.  My wife got the Strawberry cachaca drink with egg froth in it.  It tasted ok, but it smelled off, kind of rottenish, but it was still drinkable.\\n\\nFor food, we got the worlds smallest tuna tartare, literally a ramiken sized portion.  Usually at restaurants, you run out of chips before you finish the tartare.  Not at Ward 8.  We got about 4 small taro chips worth and then that was it, left to soak up the coconut, spicy broth with the other chips.  We also got the Maple Chili Duck Wings, which were great, the oysters which were good, but not worth $7.50 for 3 of them and the cashew caramel bacon corn, which was a better cracker jack.  The rest of hte food was great, but the portions are just horrendous.  I know what they're trying to do, which the sexy atmosphere and craft drinks and yadda yadda.  You can still give a good portion of food and cover your costs/profit margin.  Every other restaurant gives you a good to great portion of tuna for at MOST $14.

However, the Harvard Square location does have a few things to recommend it, and if you go in with the right attitude and approach, you can have a fun time. \\n\\nIt probably goes without saying that this is not authentic *any kind* of food.  This is bastardized, Am-Mex (not even Tex-Mex, really) food that owes more to the amount of cheese and sour cream used than the specialness of the ingredients or the authenticity of any of the dishes. \\n\\nThat said, there's nothing particularly *wrong* with what they make.  \\"Cadillac\\" fajitas are a reliable, albeit attention-whore-y dish of soft flour tortillas, sizzling chicken and steak on flatirons, and fixins to pile on.

Everything that I have tasted at SCK has been yummy.  The She Crab Soup is very tasty and highly recommended.

Why not?!) despite really, really not wanting to; the categorical buffet-imperative to eat as much as possible to make up for the $35/per person bill; mimosas; and people who use the word \\"brunch\\" to begin with.  It's just all bad.\\n\\nBut, thank the lord, Stubbs entails (almost) none of those things.  They have designated seating-times for which they make fresh, *small* batches of a limited selection of well-made, barbecue-and-breakfast-type dishes.

Let's start with a general impression here. You're walking down the street in yuppie land downtown Winter Park, and you see a sign for a \\"sushi bar\\", when you are looking for a Brazilian Steakhouse. That was confusing to begin.\\n\\nMy date and I made a reservation online, which was lovely and convenient. However, it would not let us schedule one that was less than two hours away, although there was only one other table when we got there at 9:15. I am not sure why I could not get a reservation for 8:30.\\n\\nSo, after figuring out that the \\"sushi bar\\" sign was put there to confuse us, we went inside and were greeted and had to wait a few minutes for our table even though all but one of the tables were empty. I thought tables were supposed to be ready for you when you made a reservation?\\n\\nSo, lets start to talk about service here.  Our server spoke very quickly and was hard to hear and understand over the TELEVISIONS in the dining room and the fact that the rest of the servers were moving around tables, rolling silver and dropping glasses.  We arrive 45 minutes before closing time, and the entire ambience of our meal was sacrificed by the fact that the servers wanted to go home early. Even though we paid the same amount as someone who came in at 7pm, we were not treated that way. After ordering our wine, the server corrected me on my pronunciation of Pinot Noir, my favorite red wine and did so in a very snippy and snobby way. The wine was good, but terribly overpriced at 7.50 a glass for an 11 dollar bottle of wine you can find at a gas station.\\n\\nBefore the gaucho came out with the meat skewers, we started with the salad bar, which was not bad. My only real complaint about that is that the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant. They were gritty and had a very artificial taste to them. I can make better ones at home, and I was not impressed. There was not a  huge selection of vegetables either.\\n\\nWhile we were eating I heard at least three glasses being dropped, at different times. I also could hear every word of the conversation the staff was having in the back section of the restaurant. I heard them cursing as well as using racial slurs such as the \\" n word\\". I was terribly offended, and so was my date.\\n\\nWhile the meat they served was tasty, I feel like I would have had a better dining experience at Denny's.

(I hedged my bet by also ordering biscuits and gravy, in case the pancakes were a disappointment.)  They were terrible.  For my money I got three pancakes a little smaller than a CD-ROM disk and not much thicker.  They were tough and the only flavor they had was what they got from the syrup.  Ridiculous!  So I turned my attention to my biscuits and gravy, which I had gotten before and liked.  0 for 2.  The biscuits were hard and crunchy as if they were extremely over baked.

The layout of the tables seemed a little crowded and we requested to sit in a booth instead of wedging ourselves between a 4 top and 2 larger gentlemen. The hostess/waitress seemed a little peeved at this but cleaned up the table and we were seated in about 5 minutes or so. The waitresses seemed to be most European or Russian and the one who told us about the specials was speaking so fast, that we could barely understand her.

I don't know why I waited so long, but they're FANTASTIC! Contemplating fried ribs is outside my comfort zone and I'm glad I tried it. They're good with or without the white sauce served on the side. \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with the smoked wings, best I've had ever. I love that you can smell the smoker as you approach the restaurant. The Fox Bros house BBQ sauce is really good and available for purchase (I have). I put it on everything and it's good on the fried ribs too. They serve the spiciest, most flavorful Bloody Mary I've ever tasted, have a glass of water on the side. \\n\\nI've been going to Fox Bros for years, and the food is consistently good. I've never been dissatisfied, well except maybe with the wait, but even that's worth it. This place is never empty, NEVER.

Any more than that?  No. Come back another day. Preferably a non holiday Tues, Weds or Thurs for lunch. :)\\n\\nI had the good fortune to go to Franklin St. on a day off - it was a Tuesday. We got there at 11:10 or so, and waited 1:15. It apparently happened to be the first day it was open since their holiday hiatus, which is why it was so slow for a Tuesday.\\n\\n It *ALMOST* was not worth the low blood sugar crash. It tastes so damned good, though, that as soon as my lips hit those ribs, all was forgiven.\\n\\nIf there was anything good about waiting so long for BBQ, it was that it gave the hubs and I ample time to decide what we actually wanted. Turkey? Brisket? Ribs?  We ended up with 2 orders of lean brisket, 1 of sausage and 1 of ribs.  Good thing, too - the brisket and ribs were AMAZEBALLS.  Both of us usually shy away from the briskets and ribs since they're typically so fatty - but this was genuinely good. The brisket was lean with the perfect amount of fat to peel off, and the ribs?  They fell apart. It was a beautiful thing.\\n\\nThe sausage was a little too greasy. Meh. I'll try the turkey next time.\\n\\nI had a mini facebook discussion with a friend about it afterwards - he said he'd rather go to Rudy's since it was fast just as good. Fast, yes.. but just as good?  Not by a long shot. \\n\\nAlan F is right when he says the beans are unremarkable - skip it. The coleslaw was good, and I'm glad the hubs ordered it.

I got the three-meat plate with the Texas trinity of moist brisket, ribs, and house sausage with sides of serrano cheese spinach and hand-cut fries. The brisket had a thick red smoke ring. The meat was tender but lacked favor, and the crust had a creosote aftertaste. You can get creosote with too much smoke, stale smoke, or a dirty smoker. Air needs to flow efficiently through a smoker. The sauce did help mask the taste. The rub on the ribs tasted good and were also smoky. The ribs were soft but were dry on certain bites. The sausage was fine. It was heavy on black pepper, and I liked that. The casing was chewy though. The hand-cut fries were great. It tasted fresh and was a nice change of pace. The spinach was similar to a thicker creamed spinach with spicy undertones. It was served lukewarm but was tasty. I was so full after the meal. There was an all you can eat option during lunch.

I LOVE tater tots! Again, let me Stress how much I LOVE tater tots! Now for some reason... Little 5 is the Mecca for Tater tots.  Vortex, that other place on the corner, and now the Fox Bros. Well, I've had it before and it was amazing.  Tater Tots piled high smothered with Brunswick Stew and cover with hot melted cheese ( and not that Nacho Cheese crap either... Real shredded cheese).  Plus, If you are a BBQ person you know what it means when you say, \\"I'd like inside pulled pork, or inside brisket..\\"  At Fox Bros... They know! So you don't get stuck with that dry over done meat. They give you the good hot juicy more rare meat.\\n\\nWell, I ordered the \\"Totanator\\" to start and the 1/2 rib and beef brisket combo with Mac and cheese and Baked Beans. So, I'm sitting there drinking my Beer... and the guy drops off my Totanator and walks away. Now, let me preface by saying I'm not one to complain or send food back to the kitchen.... but, I look down and I'm like \\"What the ****!\\"\\nMy Totanator did not have one tater tot!  Instead it had french fries. Did I mention how much i LOVE Tater tots?  I was more pissed that our waitress, I believe her name was Autumn. Didn't even bother to mention they were out of tots. Nor did she even acknowledge that there were no tots on there.  Autumn... if you happen to read this, You're not a good server. Sorry, but someone has to tell you! \\n\\nBut I didn't say a word, just ate it and let it go. BTW, french fries are NO substitute for Tots. So then my food comes out and the manager apologized, but said they were out of sliced Brisket, so they substituted chopped instead. Dry, over done, non-inside, chopped brisket. Frustration..., the only word to describe the look on my face. Never even saw Autumn until she brought the check.  What do you do... huh? \\n\\nThe upside is that the ribs kick Ass! and the Mac&Cheese is incredible! I'm going to throw down a 3 STAR rating because you gotta communicate with your customers.

I walked in, ordered takeout on the spot, and was on my way within minutes (but that may have had more to do with the fact that there were only two other patrons, at one table, and that other area regulars (such as I, before today) might still not be aware that a new spot is open here).\\n\\nThe miso soup was standard, nothing exceptional, but the basic fish fare impresses at least in terms of value: the sashimi portions on the lunch special were, as another reviewer noted, dauntingly generous especially by lunch standards, and I almost regretted ordering a (delicious) spicy scallop roll to go with it for lack of appetite.

I purposefully only ate half so I could enjoy leftovers today :) The flavor was that amazing. Mac-n-cheese was probably one of the best, too - a little different than most b/c they use shell pasta and oh ... lovely cheesy yummy deliciousness :) The pulled pork was really good, too - overall meal size was generous enough to have leftovers next day (so $10.95 is really a good price). \\n\\nTodd P ordered both the pulled pork and brisket and he thought the brisket was better so next time (b/c I value his opinion), brisket for me. His baked beans tasted really good, too. I'll probably also try the \\"Tomminator\\" b/c the description sounded dangerously yummy (dangerous b/c I have very high cholesterol).

It reminds me of when the Blair Witch Project came out.  The first rush of people to go see it loved it.  Then you had the next wave of people who trashed it because it was the cool thing to do.  Strange.\\n\\nSo, I'm house-sitting for some friends out this way and thought it was time to try a few of these places as I normally don't get out this way.  Always in the mood for a good burger so why not kill 2 birds with one stone.  I'm not sure what that means.  \\n\\nNo bike parking.  Not too happy about that, but now I'm off on a tangent.  Back to the food.\\n\\nI get inside and have a seat at the bar.  I'm immediately handed a menu and told what beers they have on tap.  Hmmm.  Beer and a burger.  Sounds like a plan.  Only thing was that I misplaced my ID.  I'm 35 years old.  True, I can still occasionally pass for 10 years younger and I still do get carded because of it, but it is rare that I don't get served.  I didn't get served here by the bartender/server guy.  Not 20 minutes later 2 girls sat at the bar and ordered drinks and I don't recall seeing the same guy ask them for ID's.  Ok, I understand I have a penis.  That might have been my downfall here.  It pissed me off a bit and that is why this is a 3 star and not a 4 star review.\\n\\nTo the burger.  For $7.50 you can get the Foster burger which is a burger on a An Xuyen bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and house made pickles.  Simple yet good.  I ordered it medium and it came out nice and pink.  The side of fries was huge.  The burger had a nice char to it and it was messy like the bartender/server guy said it would be.  Since I wasn't allowed a beer, I washed it all down with a ginger ale.  \\n\\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you this is the best burger I've ever had in my life, but it was damn good.  I got out of there for $11 including tip and I was completely satisfied.  Ok, a beer would have made me completely satisfied.  I was incompletely satisfied, but in a good way."},{"name":"RA Sushi Bar Restaurant","address":"117 W 4th St, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"First time here, really good food.\\nFresh fish, and awesome drinks.\\nWill definitely be back, and soon at that!\\nScallop Dynamite Roll, I live for.\\nSO GOOD!"},{"name":"Bambinelli's","address":"3202 Northlake Pkwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow, I can't believe how bad an experience we had at Bambinelli's!

She and I then split the twin lobster tails with roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables. The lobster was mind-blowing. It was delicate, buttery, rich and delicious. The vegetables were alright, as were the potatoes, but we didn't order the dish for the sides.

Most of the time the food is OK, if a little cold by the time we get it home and unwrapped. \\nTwice now I've ordered something, only to come home with the item and surprised once) it wasn't what I ordered and second) ingredients were missing. The first time I ordered a Caesar w/steak tips, only to get a blue cheese garden salad w/tips. I wrote an email to management letting them know of the snafu, since my receipt and the kitchen ticket said Caesar w/tips. They were very generous and apologized for the mistake, also offering a gift card, which wasn't expected but very much appreciated, and we enjoyed a great meal there a few weeks later. \\nThe second time was just last night. I called to order the special Guinness stew, which sounded great. When I called I was told it wasn't on the menu, which I found odd as their website said the specials were just updated the afternoon before. If it was a case of just not having the containers for stew, I would have completely understood. So I ordered the special Black Bean Burger. Arrive home, unwrap, and there's items missing!

Everyone seemed to be raving about the chicken and waffles, so that was a given part of our meal long before we sat down to order. You have the choice of getting one, two, or three pieces of fried chicken to top your sweet potato waffle. My husband for the two piece chicken and waffles and the portion was huge! I liked the chicken but thought it was a little on the salty side. \\nI wish the waffle had been a little more crunchy and firm instead of soft. \\n\\nI got the Alabama scramble, which felt like the lightest option on the menu. It came with a side of cheesy grits and a slice of wheat toast. Everything was good, if not particularly memorable. I'm not a huge fan of grits because I prefer grains that have more chew and heft, but these were good and the consistent and texture reminded me of macaroni and cheese ... but just the sauce. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, fried chicken, biscuits, and other gravy-covered fare just feels a little heavy for the first meal of the day, and I hate the inevitable food coma that ensues.

Always endured the awful music, decor, service, prices and wait times because I kept telling myself that the chicken here was worth all that crap. \\n\\nYesterday, I decided it was not worth it. \\n\\nI convinced a couple of friends to go out for some chicken here. We go into the extremely dark room with a mix of Hallowe'en and Christmas decorations hanging from the walls and get a booth. We are promptly ignored for 15 minutes until I notice everyone else waving frantically for their server and then follow suit (I guess that's the norm here?). We have questions about one of the hot pots, which takes 3 different workers to answer. We order some fried rice dish, some soup dish, and a plate of the good ol' soy chicken - my fave. At this point I notice that they turn the lights down to barely visible (what is this, Dark Table?). The music is a terrible mix of blaring K-pop, EDM, trance, house, and... Christmas carols? Seriously, we heard Mariah singing All I Want for Christmas is You in between thuddy electro that was giving me a headache.\\n\\nOur drinks do not arrive. After 15 minutes we're presented with the typical sides of cabbage shreds with store-bought coleslaw dressing drizzled on and pickled mystery root (daikon? raddish?). Remind server about drinks. She says \\"ok\\", then I watch her go clean the table next to ours (the place is half empty, and there's already a server cleaning that table), go stand at the bar and talk with the other coworkers, then disappear in to the back. She returns with another table's food, seeming to have forgotten about our drinks. \\n\\nWhen our food finally arrives after a little over half an hour, I begin to realize that I should not have taken my friends here. Josh has a stone bowl filled with fried rice, meat, and a fried egg on top that tastes identical to my cooking back home (which I do for significantly less than $13). Next to him, Kai is choking down some sort of bland korean soup that looks and tastes like clay water. It literally tasted like nothing. The fried chicken arrived shortly after, and didn't have that \\"oomph\\" that I remembered it having. It was dry and almost seems like they barely put any sauce on it, and was closer to room temperature than fresh-from-the-fryer hot. \\n\\nAnd with that, we were ignored by the front of house team. No more check-ups - their job of carrying the food from kitchen to table had been fulfilled. We spent the time wondering if this place even had a management team or if the owner had just flown off to a vacation home somewhere, leaving behind these apathetic, pimply teens to run this place at its bare minimum. When we finally admitted defeat, we went to the bar to pay and got the hell out of there. Walking out on to Robson street felt like finally escaping from some rotting catacomb and feeling sunlight and cool air for the first time in ages.\\n\\nI guess I'm so frustrated because the chicken is normally so good that I constantly crave it, and every time I go to Zabu I am met with all these annoyances and frustrations and barriers to just getting my damn chicken. Considered just going with takeout, but judging by other reviewers here, they suck just as badly as take-out as they do dine-in. Oh well - they got enough of my money, and they can keep their chicken.\\n\\nI also want to emphasize that this experience is repeated pretty much every time I go here, it's not just some uniquely bad experience.

I'm as open to new and interesting flavors as the next guy but again, it really did not work. Adding the rice and the ginger with the burger components then putting pesto on it?

They're just right at Pok-e-Jo's, whereas they might be too fatty elsewhere, so keep that in mind if you like a tender brisket.

This is a nice area of Heathrow/Lake Mary where folks would like to be waited on. At least I do! Another thing is the name of the restaurant. I had NO idea it was Mediterranean, which I love. The name Whitewood alone doesn't tell you what it is. I must of drove by the place 20 times, thinking, \\"I wonder what kind of place that is?\\" Not even knowing it was a restaurant. Finally, they need to let people know how great their food is. I was told that everything was organic. That's huge and people need to know that they have this option in the Lake Mary area. \\nSo here are my suggestions:\\n- Get some booths. Everybody loves 'em! And PLEASE, get some comfy chairs. \\n- Hire another person to wait tables. When we were there, on a Saturday night, there were two people working...counter girl and chef. That's just not enough.\\n- Print some to go menus \\n- Set up a table outside and offering some delicious samples to folks passing by, or attend the Lake Mary Farmer's Market and let people sample your food.

The conversation would go on for ten minutes+ before the order is placed! This problem could be easily solved! Have they thought of having TWO cashiers to take orders instead of one? \\n\\nPlease take a look at Hopdoddy's ordering system! There are two cashiers to take order. This way if one party feels like asking a zillion questions, they can spend as much time as they want without annoying the people behind them!\\n\\nAlso, the Vietnamese restaurant \\"phonatics\\" on far west blvd has a self-ordering system where customers can order on a touchscreen by themselves. I think ramen tatsuya should get the same machine so that we (the poor customers who've been waiting 30 minutes) can get our order in as quickly as possible instead of waiting for slow people to ask questions already answered in the menu!\\n\\n2. the long line is a huge turn off. There are many times I want to visit this place after 8pm, but still see a line of at least 10 people waiting... please improve your ordering system or else you are losing customers! \\n\\n3. \\"forceful\\" seating arrangement - OK I have to confess that I'm a petite person, but this does not give the server the right to force me to move into a corner or around for THREE TIMES! This is tested out already! I feel like the server would only let people who occupy smaller space to move about more, my friends and I were asked to move three times during the 15 minutes we were eating! How will dragging your chair three time around the table make you feel? While the three of us made space for others  to sit right next to us, the people who were sitting on the opposite side of the long table did not have to move an inch! \\n\\nServers, please be fair when you are asking people to move into tiny corners. If you ask one end of the table to move, you should do the same to the other end. \\n\\nWe paid.

From where I entered the line, I was told we should expect to eat around 1 pm -- a 4.5 hour wait. In front of me was a middle-aged couple from outside of Scranton, PA. They were on a week-long trip to Texas to do research for the barbecue restaurant they plan to open in their hometown. Behind me was a food blogger from Brooklyn and her friend, another twenty-something girl who lives in Austin just across the street from the restaurant. We all received the news of the wait together, and proceeded to make the most of it with breakfast tacos, hot tea and coffee from the nearby cart, and wonderful conversation.\\n\\nThe couple from Pennsylvania, they couldn't have been more lovely. Married at age 19, they're now empty-nesters in their 50's. The husband has a successful welding business that he's starting to wind down, and with his machinery skills he'd taken up an interest in building smokers for barbecue. After experimenting with several designs, he'd found one that made decent brisket and ribs. The town locals were a little wary at first of Texas-style barbecue -- it was just a little too foreign for them. But with the recent rise of natural gas harvesting in their area, there's been an influx of transplanted workers from the South and Southwest, and the couple put two-and-two together: they finally had the customer base for their budding dream of a barbecue takeout restaurant.\\n\\nTheir energy was infectious. We could have chatted with them for hours more -- listening to their assessment of all the other barbecue joints they'd visited so far, the different aspects of each they were hoping to incorporate into their own establishment, how their sons are helping design a logo and a Facebook page, subtle cooking and smoking techniques, on and on and on. Likewise, they were curious about my life in the Bay Area, how I ended up there and in a medical career, and why a cardiologist would be so eager to try fatty brisket. The food blogger and I became Instagram friends. A great time was had by all.\\n\\nBy the time we finally ordered our food, we all ended up eating together, taking pictures and relishing each and every slice and cut of meat.

The salad bar by itself ($7.99) is filling enough, but for just one dollar more, you can add soup or minis (two sliders) and a side (fries, onion rings, etc.) to your order.  It's a better value by adding that extra food and if you can't finish it, you can just take it home.\\n\\nThe salad bar is stocked with generic items that are typically replenished regularly so the ingredients stay crisp and fresh.

Bright, vibrant color schemes coupled with brilliant art work and interesting digital displays throughout, which make this place very appealing to the eye. And in my opinion, it needs to be able to stand out as it is surrounded by restaurant giants like Emeril's and Margaritaville. \\n\\nThis place has an interesting and unusual menu, as it encompasses sushi and hamburgers, and sometimes both of them together in some sort of fashion!\\n\\nBeing a fan of both good beef for hamburgers as well as bbq, I couldn't resist but to order the combination of the 2! The patty appeared to be just under 1/2 lb, cooked medium. With everything on it, it quickly became a mouthful of a challenge! When ordering, I noted the restaurant  took great pride in saying \\"Our Black Angus Beef...\\" was in every hamburger  description, and with good reason! This burger was busting with flavor, even beyond the added bbq pork, fresh veggies and delicious onion straws! Struggling to keep the juices from flowing off my hands and onto my shirt, I continuously had to be careful not to bite a finger, lol! This meal went great with my Corona lite w/ lime.\\n\\nThat being said, I cannot say the same for the sushi. I had 6 pieces of a standard California roll, all of which was semi-dry and I struggled to keep it all together (it just kept falling apart). The best part of the sushi was the wasabi,  which provided some exceptional flavor, coupled with the soy sauce.\\n\\nIt would be shameful of me not to mention the level of customer service we received during this visit.....just out-of-this-world good! The young lady, Tatiana, was just wonderful and a breath of fresh air! She was timely, efficient and personable!

We arrived at the resort late in the afternoon so rather than waste a day pass to one of the theme parks for the few remaining hours they were open, we decided to spend the evening at Citywalk. Cowfish did not look busy from the front but when I inquired about getting a table, I was told that it would be about a 45 minute wait. Their paging system is by cell phone, so roaming around Citywalk was not a problem.\\n\\nCowfish is actually located on the second floor above the Vivo Italian Kitchen. They have both an indoor as well as a covered outdoor dining area. The decor is colorful and casual with solid wood dining tables and plastic chairs (and not just in the outdoor patio either). The cuisine is Japanese-American fusion.\\n\\nTheir menu was quite extensive and they had a separate kids menu which consisted of nothing but Bento Boxes. Creative names for kids favourites like Ninja nuggets, PB&J Sushi Roll, and Gorilla Cheez. Since we were going fusion, we skipped all conventional dinner entr√©es found in American and Japanese restaurants, and our bill of fare for the evening consisted of: Parmesan Bacon Truffle Fries, Doug's Filet Roll, The Prime-Time Filet and Lobster Roll, The All-american Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi, Seared Sesame Tuna Salad, Fusion Specialty Bento Box with Nigiri,\\n\\nTruffle Fries. I had these not too long ago for the first time at The Dime Store and they were absolutely fantastic! So naturally, I had to have them again. The Cowfish version was similar, but not exactly the same. While the truffle oil was prominent, it seemed to have overpowered the Parmesan a bit too much. While The Dime Store had a better balance of flavours, Cowfish was no slouch. 4 stars.\\n\\nDoug's Filet Roll. Essentially a California Roll topped with seared slices of filet mignon (tenderloin), spicy mayo, scallions, and masago (capelin/smelt roe). There was a creaminess to the roll which I later found out to be cream cheese. It was slight, and provided texture more than flavour, but I still didn't care for it. The thin slices of beef were cooked thoroughly from the searing. IMO, they should have gone with a thicker sliced sushi grade beef and seared it. While the dish didn't taste bad, I think it still failed. 2,5 stars.\\n\\nFilet & Lobster Roll. Not being a fan of Kani (fake crab meat), my choices were easily narrowed down to a handful. nothing else really caught my eye, so I decided on a roll with lobster in it. The lobster meat was disappointing as it was that from the claws rather than the tail. Claw meat does have some advantages from a tenderness and presentation perspective; but personally, taste always trumps appeal when it comes to food. This roll had the same thinly sliced seared filet mignon on top. Garnished with pan fried mushrooms, spicy mayo, green onions, sesame seeds and truffle oil, a symphony of flavours were present with every bite. Much like Doug's Filet Roll, I think the concept of this dish is good, but the execution was off the mark. At 23 bucks, you can afford to use the premium cuts of beef and lobster. 2,5 stars.\\n\\nBacon Double Cheeseburgooshi. This was actually a late add after I saw it served to another customer. Essentially a cheeseburger roll. The centre was filled with ground beef, melted cheese, and bacon. It was topped with diced pickles, red onions, and tomatoes. Unlike the other 2 rolls I tried, the execution of this one was good. Unfortunately, here it lacked concept. What this turned out to be was nothing more than sloppy joe with bacon bits encased in steamed rice. Despite it's lack of fusion, and it's simplicity, it was ok all-around. 3 stars.\\n\\nSeared Tuna Salad. This dish was served with yellow fin tuna, and while the slices were a tad on the thin side, they seared it properly none the less. The salad consisted mainly of premium greens but did have sprinkles of cabbage (for that fusion aspect I guess). The tuna carried very little flavour on it's own, but the salad towed the line. The asian inspired vinaigrette was decent and not overpowering. The size of the salad was enough to share as a starter, but the ratio of fish to salad was off (It should be at least 4 oz.). Once again, I think they could have done more in terms of creativity and fusion; perhaps an crunchy element, or a different flavour from traditional Ahi Salad. Overall, a sound dish. 3,5 stars for using better greens than most.\\n\\nFusion Specialty Bento Box. This came with a mini burger, 3 pcs of sushi (nigiri), pickled cucumbers, sweet potato fries, and edamame. The sushi was your staple of salmon and red tuna. the fish was of a good length, but was a little shy in thickness. 3 stars.\\n\\nTo sum it up. Cowfish has good concepts, and while their dishes taste ok, their prices are bull-oney. IMO their food falls short based on what they're commanding. Overall 3 stars."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This was my first spot when I landed in Boston.

Good size portion but something I don't itch for everytime I go back to eat there\\n- eh guacamole: the price of the guac definitely reflects the quality. Don't get me wrong, it's sufficiently yummy once I add a few more spritzes of lime to it.\\n- eh to the seating arrangments in that place: Everytime I've gone with a big group of people I've always had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes. And then when I finally get to sit down, I'm full from all the margaritas I've been drinking and all the tortilla chips I've been snacking on while standing up. and then I ask myself: I waited this long.. for this?\\n\\nPro-factors:\\n- pro drink: HUGE margaritas for the price. While they don't seem to have a lot of tequila in it (not that I can taste) it makes you feel good that you're not paying $10 for the size that you're paying for.\\n- pro good place to go with a group of friends: While I complained about coming here with a big group of people, it still is a good place to go with such a number. No one is going to complain about the quality of the food, decently-priced drinks... so it gets a 4 star for being a good place to go with groups.\\n- pro tortilla chips: I'm not sure that they make their own tortilla chips, but they are always heated and are so delicious everytime I go there."},{"name":"No Mas!

Also the Chicken & sweet potato waffle i was pleasantly surprised at the moisture & taste of the boneless fried chicken. And the waffle! Wow you definitely have to request the La. Cane syrup to get the real southern taste that was meant to be.. And of course we could not pass up the Screendoor praline bacon, this my friends is the TRUTH! its rare we find southern comfort food were EVERYTHING is so right, being a southern girl (Ga) my friend normally leaves missing home for lack of authenticity, however this trip she left missing home because the food touched her tastebuds in all the places her momma used to with her home cooking.

I'm a yearly visitor of the Reno Rib Cookoff and these ribs would be in the mix for winners there. The best part? Don't even need sauce for ANY meat here, and I'll be honest I've had better sauces but any BBQ enthusiast will tell you, it's not about the sauce. Brisket, both fatty and lean, was fantastic. Pulled pork was moist, tender, and perfectly brined. Hot link was sweet and savory, right amount of heat. They ran out of turkey by the time I got to order, but no biggie, not a huge turkey fan anyways. Which brings me to my next point, the line. It is part of the experience. Would I rather not wait in line? Of course, but that would also mean the BBQ wouldn't be worth waiting for.

The whole thing is dusted with powdered sugar and held together by a knife plunged through those honking huge pieces of chicken on top of the waffle.  \\n\\nIt takes some maneuvering to assemble the dish properly  As my sister and I have discovered through many trips to Roscoe's, you have to pour the syrup onto the waffle, then lay the chicken on top of the waffle, then pour gravy (which you have to order on the side) over the chicken.  Then dig in!  (oh, very importantly, chicken and waffle go in your mouth at the same time)\\n\\nTheir chicken here is great...they might be lacking the juicy dark meat chicken that you can order at Roscoe's, but it is fried perfectly, not at all greasy, plus they make their batter a little spicy so it's got this incredible kick to it.  I was only able to finish a piece and a half of it before my stomach protested.\\n\\nThey had a special of ham and asiago biscuits that morning (deee-lish!!) which were absolute perfection, not too greasy, but flaky and flavorful.  They didn't require any butter or anything else.\\n\\nTheir coffee is bottomless.  Their eggs fluffy.  Their potatoes are big and chunky slices but roasted and crispy on the outside.

The atmosphere is beautiful and modern. It is upscale. There are many people working there which is why I was quite surprised it seemed there was only one or two servers in the bar/outside area of the restaurant and it was completely packed. I had a delicious cocktail with vodka and elferflower liqueur they called \\"Snapchat worthy\\" (I did snap it). I don't like sushi so I ordered the Philly cheese steak maki. It was superb. I also ordered xo udon noodles, which did not come out with the rest of the food. I assumed it would come out next so I waited, and, waited, and waited. Having been a server myself I know it is server etiquette 101 to check in with guests after they get their food to be sure everything came out properly. Our server never came. I could see her moving quickly between the bar area and outside area. Fifteen minutes after I got my food a di\\nffrent server came over and asked how everything was. I told her the noodles never came out and that the server hasn't come to the table in over 15 minutes and I was already done with my other food. She said she'd check on it, then came back and said it would be out in a minute, and it was. \\n The food and atmosphere here is great. The service was absolutely terrible and not because this server was incompetent,  it was not possible for her to be serving all these tables. I was dumbfounded why a nice new restaurant like this would not be adequately staffed."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I got the avocado cone here(not sure if that's the name?) it was about $6 for fried avocado and coleslaw.

I feel fairly confident that I'd be able to say the same about other pastries here.\\n\\nService was great, efficient, and the ambiance was lovely as well.

My wife and I had two young Japanese folks sitting next to us, and they seemed to be pretty happy with their food; I hope that means it's authentic enough.\\n\\nWe came in during a relative lull in the action, but the few people in front of us took FOREVER to order. It was ridiculous. Before coming here, I had already made up my mind to just get the basic #1 Ramen, so it took me all of 45 seconds to wrap up my order and pay. I even asked the cashier \\"did I do something wrong? Should I have taken longer to order?\\" She laughed and said no. In the meantime, a long line had formed behind us due to the three people in front us taking several minutes EACH. I can only surmise that some people are either completely unaware of what the menu consists of, or they're one of \\"them\\" - you know, the people in front of you at HEB when you're in a hurry and have only 5 items? Something always seems to go wrong with their transaction, taking 10 minutes to complete.\\n\\nAnyway - the Ramen was as described by others: Very rich, almost creamy. It had a slight taste of miso and very good. I wonder what the broth tasted like when they first opened, as several people have mentioned that it changed a few months ago. The pork belly was out-of-this-world flavorful, and the mushrooms and the egg were a perfect compliment to the broth. Overall, it was very tasty and also very unique from my \\"typical American\\" perspective ;) .\\n\\nI'm not too crazy about the loud music that was playing. I suppose they're trying to appeal to a younger crowd, but I've never been a fan of loud music; you end up having to almost shout to talk to other people, and everyone has to be that loud which makes the noise level even more intolerable.

As I drove up, I noticed the exterior's lighting and sign was pretty cool. As I strolled through the front,  I saw there was a lot of outdoor seating which was pretty nice and could see myself going for during the cooler spring/fall days or summer nights. Once inside, the decor was similar to the outside, what I would call - \\"swanky industrial\\". It's not what I would think of as a bistro, but I'm open to unlikely pairings.\\n\\nOnce seated, we ordered drinks, snacks and mix of the smaller plates to share. The drinks were good. The food, however, was.....unimpressive. First, the waiter did not help explain some of the interesting ingredient combinations on the menu. With that said, I felt the only way to know was to try it. I don't mind this approach as I enjoying experiencing new foods and going on a culinary journey the chef has creatively put together. \\n\\nHere is the assortment of plates I tried:\\n\\nTomato salad - This was ok, but nothing exquisite. I've made better at home. \\n\\nFried chicken -  This dish was pretty basic. The tomatoes, toffee and ginger flavors did nothing for me or the chicken. \\n\\nSteak Tartare - The tartare was actually pretty good. What was strange was that it was served deconstructed and the waiter instructed ME to mix it with the flavors that I liked. Call me lazy, but I find that when I go out to eat it's because I want food served to me ready to eat. \\n\\nScallop Crudo - I asked the waiter about this dish and all he could say was that it was raw. It was raw alright and tasty, but did not make sense on the menu as it reminded me of a sushi dish. \\n\\nFrench Fries with Miso aioli and ketchup - It's hard to go wrong with fries, but miso aioli was meh. I feel like the miso aioli I've had at Second Bar + Kitchen was WAY BETTER. I love condiments so I remember when my taste buds meets a good one. \\n\\nDuck Leg Confit - too dry. \\n\\nIn summary, I just found the menu  underwhelming and lacking cohesion. Between the decor, loud music, name (bistro) and menu, I think Mettle is trying to be too many things at once. With all the great restaurants popping up around Austin, it has serious competition. So while Mettle has potential, they will need to step up their game to last."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is worth checking out if you are in the newbury area.

The space is divided in several sections with seating in an upstairs loft also available, so I felt nice and cozy.\\n\\nThe menu was informative. It had the story of Digger &amp; Finch and trivia questions like \\"Why do 18 holes constitute one round of golf?\\". I wasn't so sure this restaurant would suit Digger and Finch's personalities.

I didn't try the egg, but it looked pretty - seriously.\\n\\nFor the main course, there were several vegetarian options including a nice pasta. They also had meatloaf, steak, bangers and mash, and the like. I had the fish and chips. It was a huge platter with three pieces of fish. I substituted fries for onion rings. The onion rings were very good. The fish was so-so. I liked the batter, and, for the most part, the fish itself was good. But every so often, I would encounter a dark section of fish that didn't taste so good, and another person at our table got an entire piece that was dark.\\n\\nOur server was great.

We stopped in last night at 8pm (on a Wednesday) and the place was packed. We had a short wait for our table (about 5 minutes) but that was only because the restaurant was pretty busy and slightly understaffed. Lots of people were getting to go orders and we grabbed the only open table in the whole place! \\n\\nAmbience\\nThe ambience would get 2 stars. Nice enough but nothing I would think of for a special night out with my husband. Pretty casual, we had a fun time and excellent food.\\n\\nFood\\nI orders yellow curry and we split the vegetarian egg rolls. I always get a side of peanut sauce as this is a favorite of mine. All of the food was superb, delicious, well presented and tasted fresh and flavorful. Unique spices in my mild dish presented a fun \\"tangy\\" and sweet flavor that dressed up a mild flavor without overdoing it. My palette is pretty basic and most unique food is a turn off to me. However, I liked that they added cucumber and broccoli to a traditionally carrots, cabbage and potato dish. Huge sizes ( I could have split it and still been too full to finish). The egg rolls were so good that for a vegetarian appetizer I was convinced there must be meat in it! Too my surprise is was not meat but another inventive option, the egg rolls had silver noodles and veggies but also taro root (similar to potato). Filling and very tasty!! \\n\\nEnding comment\\nBottom line, we will go back for the food but probably would choose this as a casual go-to lunch spot or evening to-go order.

First and foremost, my Fiance hates standing in line for anything other than possibly a cigar, LOL. So with that in mind, on our first day in Austin, I was so disappointed to see a line wrapped around the building because I knew he was not up for it.  We came back later that evening, not realizing that they close fairly early, and they were having a private event. One of the people hosting the event, who saw us approaching the door,  was nice enough to allow us in & even offered my Fiance a beer. However they were out of Brisket by then so we opted to come back the next day,  and boy am I glad we did ! The following day the line was much shorter than the day before, so I coaxed my Fiance into waiting since we were leaving town later that day.  With the right mindset, it is not an unbearable wait. There's  lot's of people watching to be had, and once you get inside you can entertain yourself by reading some of the numerous articles  about the place posted on the walls leading up to the counter. All of this waiting and reading can build up a lot of anticipation and expectations and ultimately, I do believe the hype !  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I appreciate them asking if you like your brisket lean or with a bit of fat on it, as they slice it for you. Between the three of us, we ordered a combination of items,  but it was the brisket that was the star of the show. It just melts in your mouth ! Thought is a counter service, seat yourself kind of place, there was a guy who was more than helpful with finding a seat for our group as this can be challenging when the place is so full, to determine who is getting ready to leave, etc and there are multiple people standing waiting for a spot to sit and eat. This was very appreciated. Also, I love the variations of sauce they offer. Most places just offer one type & too bad if you don't like the flavor, LOL so having a choice of three types of sauce was a nice surprise. But honestly, this Brisket needs not a drop of sauce to hold its own.  The quantity for the price is great as well. We had so much food left over, that we had enough for dinner later that night.. Also, the owner approached our table to ask how we enjoyed everything (I recognized him from the many articles I read while waiting in line LOL) that is always a nice touch.

And I needed to find a way to pass time before meeting up with some friends. I happened to be in the area right around the 5:00 opening time. Apparently, they weren't completely done setting up after 5:00, and a couple of the bartenders seemed annoyed to see me. How was I supposed to know you all weren't ready after opening time? The bartenders weren't very attentive (but the male bartender there was friendly and actually spoke to me), I guess since they were still doing prep work and all. Eventually, I was able to order the BB Cooler cocktail. It's a vodka-based drink and was pretty cool.\\n\\nI saw one of the bartenders holding flamingo straws, and I joked that I should get a straw for being the first person to arrive to the opening party. She snapped at me and said the straws are for people who order the One in a Melon cocktail only. Honey, I was joking and trying to make small talk since you seem a bit uptight. Heaven forbid I take a straw away from the people that rightfully earned them!\\n\\nI decided to leave the bartenders and go sit outside since it was a nice day, so I ordered another drink, closed my bar tab, and had planned to grab a bite to eat. After 10 minutes of sitting there with no service--remember, I was the first to get there so they weren't busy at this point--I left without even finishing my second cocktail. It was the On Leave, but I can't tell you how it tasted. \\n\\nNot sure what kind of vibes I may have been putting out there for the lackluster service. Maybe I'll give them another try a few hours after they've opened up, or not ask for festive straws that are intended for certain drinks only."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I went to Yelp to find a place for dinner in this particular area.

It sorta took a while to get drinks. Once there was another guy behind the bar, things ran much more smoothly. \\n\\nThis was a little dramatic and annoying. I think around 7, we were bum rushed out of our table by management & bartenders. It would be one thing to politely tell us that the \\"DJ\\" needed the space for the table, but it's another when chairs start getting moved without warning. One bartender sets up another table for us in the back and another guy shows us to another set of tables. Then, I think this random lady or a bar manager got angry because some tables had to be reserved and just wasn't very professional. But we had a good bartender, next round was on the house. We had shots of a redheaded slut minus the jager with whiskey, which I was informed is called a Royal F*ck. It was appropriate that that particular shot was what was toasted to me. \\n\\nSkee ball was fun, but only one unit worked and there weren't many balls to try to use the other units.
