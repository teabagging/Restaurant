Overall, it usually satisfies my craving. The other dishes are... okay. Nothing special, but for the price it's a good stomach filler if you are new to Thai food.

If you buy the Groupon deal the restaurant treats it like a gift card.  For us, we had a $180 credit to our bill.  If you don't want any \\"fees,\\" you should stick to the $45 entrees and do not order drinks.\\n\\nOverall I had an amazing time at the Fez, but it was not the *upscale* dining experience I was expecting.  I'm not going to say it was a bad experience, but there wer a few things that could have been done differntly to make me feel the meal was worth the regular price they charge.\\n\\nI made a reserviation for a Wednesday night at 8:00pm.\\n\\nI have no gripes about the complimentary valet.  It wasn't too busy, and the one guy working the valet seemed to have it under control.  Leaving we did have a wait a bit, but nothing too long.\\n\\nWe were about 10 minutes early for our reservation, and they were more than happy to seat us.  However, it took about 10-15 minutes before the waitress spilled a glass of red wine on my husband durning the first dance.  I'm not sure if it was a bit of rug that was pushed up or the dancer / waitress combination that caused the glass to be dropped.  Thankfully they have all those towels for the meal, so we got him dried off and they replaced his chair.\\n\\nWe waited a bit longer for the waitress to finally come over and get us started.  She apologized for the spill and offered to have someone run out and buy my husband a new shirt.  We declined, and they ultimately took off half the bottle of wine.  She then explained the menu, explained how the Groupon works, and took our drink orders.\\n\\nI don't recall if it was before or after this that we were finally brought glasses of water.  In that regard, I've had better service at Waffle House.  If they want to continue to charge fine dining prices, then they need to get their service on par with that expecatation.  However, I will say that the service was better than what I was expecting after reading most of the Yelp reviews.  It was just odd to me that we were not acknowledged by the wait staff until after someone spilled wine on my husband.\\n\\nAs far as service goes for the rest of the night, I don't think there was anything else that could have been better.  The waitress let us know that they all work together, and so anyone could help us if we needed it.  I never thought there was any sort of unreasonable delay between courses, and both the waitress and the other server that seemed to be her assistant checked on us regularly to make sure our food was good and that there was nothing else we needed.\\n\\nJust before the soup and salads course was brought out, the staff brought a large silver basin and kettle of warm water to wash our hands.  They also gave us a towel for our left shoulder.  When the soup and salad was placed on the table the waitress let us know that it is customary to eat with the right hand, but they did provide forks it we wanted them.\\n\\nThe first two courses included the lentil soup, which was quite delicious.  The large tray of salads were amazing.  My personal favorites were the collard greens and the carrots.  There were so many very different flavors!  Also, even if you are not a spicy fan do try a small bit of the red harissa.  It has an amazing smokey flavor with an extra kick after it settles in your mouth.\\n\\nThe B'stella was unlike anything I have ever had before.  I'm really confused by some of the reviews complaning about the sweet & savory combination.  Yes, there is powdered sugar and cinnamon on a phylo pastry filled with cornish hen and almonds.  I would have been fine if they brought me one all to myself to eat for dinner.\\n\\nI picked the cornish hen with apples as my entree, and I must say that the appetizer courses made the entree seem bland.  It wasn't actually bland.  I just seemed that way in comparison.  My husband had the lamb shank and and I also tried the red snapper my friend had.  All were good, but just not as exciting as the appetizers.\\n\\nThe mint tea and dessert was wonderfully simple.  The mint tea was incredibly sweet, which I'm not sure if that is traditional or if it has just been Americanized.  The dessert consided of a bowl of fruit (apples, strawberries, and cantaloupe) and a small pastry filled with a chocolate and dried fruit mixture.\\n\\nOverall I would go back with another Groupon deal, but I would likely not patron the Fez otherwise.\\n\\nWhere they could improve:\\n- Make sure the wait staff makes contact with customers shortly after they are seated.  As a new patron, I wasn't sure if we were being ignored or if that is \\"normal\\" service.\\n-Don't bring out plastic forks with the dessert (or any) course.\\n-Replace the rugs with a persian rug printed carpet, so waiters are less likely to trip.\\n\\nI could comment more, but Yelp says that I've already said enough. :-P\\n\\nAll I would add is that maybe Cafe Istanbul and Fez should have a baby."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great down to earth with creative twists!

I usually head to one of my favorite restaurants next door to Teji's, but Indian food suited my craving better. I figured I'd give it a shot. \\n\\nMy first impression is that it was small and quaint, set up more like a deli where you order at the counter and they bring you your food. I ordered the samosoas, palek paneer and an iced tea. The man at the counter mumbled a question to me that I couldn't hear, so I asked him what he said. He looked at me annoyed and asked again in the same low tone. Only because I try to lip read, did I understand that he was asking if I wanted sweetened or unsweetened tea. He mumbled a few other things during our exchange that I had to ask him to repeat, and finally the exchange was over. \\n\\nI sat down at a table near the kitchen, and when I rested my arms on the table, which was sticky like it had been wiped down with a dirty washcloth. I'm not fussy enough to have them wipe it down (they'd probably just use the same cloth it had already been \\"cleaned\\" with) since I don't plan on eating the food off of the table. \\n\\nMy meal arrived fairly timely, but no drink. The same guy from the counter delivered my food to the table, and mumbled something. Next thing I know he brought me water. I told him I'd ordered tea, and he once again acted annoyed and eventually brought me my tea. I took a bite of my samosa first, and it was okay. The filling was a little on the spicy side, but good flavor. The outer pastry, however, was kind of tough like the dough had been overworked. In all, the samosas were just okay. They had brought out basmati rice with the palek paneer, each in their own bowls, with an extra plate, like one would do when serving family style. I spooned some of the rice onto my plate and topped it with the paneer. It looked like palek paneer: chopped spinach in a spiced cream sauce that has been colored a deep yellow with tasty turmeric. I was so disappointed upon taking my first bite.  The sauce, instead of tasting creamy, tasted oily. Instead of it tasting a delicious balance of cumin, coriander. turmeric, and curry it tasted as though something were missing. And although there was paneer in it, it tasted like no other paneer I've ever had...and not in a good way. This paneer had a odd texture, and something was off with it's flavor as well. It was not inedible, and I was on a lunch break, pressed for time, so I ate my meal. \\n\\nIf only one thing had been wrong, I would probably have given this place more stars, but I felt like the service, food and cleanliness we all inadequate.

Regulars lined the bar and the 'Dube seems to offer up just enough irony to appeal to hipsters.\\n\\nThe Blue Danube has something unique to offer. Just look up. I think you'll be able to spot any new diner at The 'Dube by the heads looking up to the ceiling. Each tile on the ceiling is decorated by a different artist, arguably over different eras based on content and smoke damage (seriously you can see the yellowing from pre-smoking ban).

You mix it up, making sure to get the crunchy rice on the edges in contact with the hot pot well mixed up. Who knew the best bibimbap I'd have in Portland was from a place called Tasty n Alder? \\n\\nThe steak and eggs was also a great dish. Simple yet made well. Rich eggs, tender steak. There's also a corn pancake like thing on the bottom? I was originally thinking it was there soak the grease but it tasted good to me.

That definitely put it over the top from full to pure gluttony but I wasn't going to go to place like this and not clean off every plate. It was the one with bacon bits and cheese and I believe eggs too over radicchio. Not your diet type of salad to be sure. Ridiculously good with a lot of rich items blending together yet without being too much. I don't usually go to places and order a salad (except as a side), but this is definitely I could see purposely ordering the next time I go.\\n\\nAnd yet we still have yet to try some of the other dishes highly recommended here.

I personally don't understand restaurants that consistently have very long waits, but do not take reservations. Walking in and putting down my name so you can call me in two hours is pretty much the same thing as me making a reservation. However because of the great reviews, we decided to hold out for the hour and a half to two hour wait we were estimated. Luckily we were called in closer to the hour and a half mark and waited another few minutes at the door. The hostess was nice enough to comp two glasses of champagne while we waited which was a very nice touch and soothed our patience after waiting so long. Once seated, we also lucked out in getting a table for two next to a wall, leaving only one couple to our left. The tables are seated so closely together you can hear every word your neighbor's say, but the ambiance was nice overall. Our server was very warm and helpful with the menu. For two people, we ended up ordering the crab dip, cheese platter, scallops, and duck duck potatoes. All in all the food was just okay. The crab was by far both of our favorite. The cheese platter is just a cheese platter, which I wouldn't hold against the restaurant, as you know what you're getting in that case. The scallops were nicely seared, but had sand in them and were bland. I personally had two bites with sand/grit out of the three scallops on the plate. The potatoes were delicious, but slightly undercooked. All of the dishes are small, but are advertised as a family style which you should share with the table. I'd say that all of our dishes ended up being the perfect amount of food for two people, and was $30 each with tip (no booze).

I don't like broccoli at all, but if you do, the broccoli looked perfectly cooked.  bright green and the perfect balance of soft and firm.  the snow peas were also wonderful; I cadged a few to add to my spicy pork dish.\\none has the option of getting your delicious entr√©e dish with fried rice instead of steamed; we did this.  though it was yummy, be warned that it is strictly fried rice:  no veg, no meat.  there is a tiny bit of scrambled egg, though.  it went beautifully with both dishes."},{"name":"Kehoe & Co","address":"709B Main St","city":"Oregon City","stars":"3.5","text":"We were warned about Kehoe & Co. Fortunately, in this instance, I rarely heed words of caution. There was very little I did not like about Kehoe & Co. Our server Nicole was professional, friendly and attentive. The scope of the place is casual, clean and comfortable. Kids are allowed, they have outdoor seating and a full bar. The menu is easy on the eyes being only one page. Refreshing to see that becoming a trend again. Simple choices, not a lot of margin for error and no serious redundancies. \\n\\nPlates will generally run you $8-14, standard for the area. They have a few appetizers, entrees, salads and sandwiches. They feature sausage. Pork (boar), Beef, Bison and Lamb to be exact. I'm not going to embellish, the sausages were pretty good. You can build your own on a bun or order a entree featuring one. I recommend the appetizer sampler. It has three featured sausages and some other salty tasty goodies.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the Bison Sliders (appetizer). I can only assume that the actual Bison Burger is a treat. The pretzel was fantastic. I did not care for the beer cheese sauce it was served with but loved it alone and with some stone ground mustard we found. \\n\\nMy companion felt that the sausage lacked a bit of salt but found the spices fine. I disagreed. I felt the salt level (light) in this case maximized the flavor of the meat and spices. I think the Bison sausage was my favorite but the Boar sausage was so juicy it burst on the plate. Delightful show for a foodie brat like me. \\n\\nI'm going to have to go my own way on this one and give Kehoe thumbs up."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"A very delicious place to go grab a biscuit sandwich.

But most of the dishes I had tonight were just OK.  The flavors are interesting, but not necessarily delicious.  And the portions are pretty small.  I started with the burrata and tomato, which was good, but burrata usually makes me swoon, and this did not.  The beets and blueberry were up next.  Again, I didn't feel like I was eating something very yummy, just interesting.  The Brandade potato warm dish was OK.  Our main course, fluke, was the best dish we had - well cooked and nicely paired with a lovely green sauce.  Desserts were OK - I tasted the chocolate mousse, which was awesome, and I had the panna cotta.  It was served with dried herbs sprinkled on top and their flavors were savory, not sweet.  I tasted the honey cake; again interesting flavors and textures, but not awesome.\\nWe had some nice glasses on wine, and other than our waiter, who came off as a snob, the rest of the service was good. We had two amuse bouches (the first which was just gross), a granita for a palate cleanser (sorrel and ginger - not so good), and mini madelines with the bill.

She would have been better off keeping quiet because even my 12 year old knows how sweet tea making works! Lol! My friend just ended up adding a couple of sugar packets. I was really disappointed with my margarita. It was so watered down. Totally not what I remembered a Presidente margarita tasting like. \\nIt took a while for the entrees to come out but they finally arrived.

It overall lacked flavor and tasted weird. I didn't even finish it. My friend seemed ok with his as he cleared his plate. We opted out of dessert because quite frankly I was ready to leave.

Jan and I shared two desserts, the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce and whipped cream and the cookie plate, we enjoyed both.

My partner and I ordered a corn dog meal, fried oreos (4), fried pickles (4 spears), and fried cheesecake (1 cheesecake bite). The total cost came out to about $20. We went to the food trailer park with a couple of friends who went to different trailers. We were the first to order and sit down and our friends ordered, (from different trailers) got and finished their food before we even got our order. I would have been a little more understanding if there had been a line or it was a busy day, but we were the first order of the evening. We waited at least 15-20 minutes for a fried food order.\\n\\nAs for the food, the corn dog batter was pretty good. However, it was nothing special. $8 for a corn dog, drink, and fries seemed a little steep. The oreos were good as well, but would have been better with a scoop of ice cream. The fried pickles had stayed in the fryer much too long. They were crispy little slivers that were crunchy. The pickles may have been cut disproportionately because one of them was thicker and tasted fine, but the other three tasted like crunchy little chips. I loved the fried cheesecake, but some people may not like the squishy consistency. \\n\\nOverall, with the amount of time we waited, the price, and the quality of the food left for a disappointing visit.

We suffered some initial confusion over how to get in; we could see right in to the dining area through the french doors that were opened onto the street, but since it was blocked off by some kind of little bar we hesitated -- literal-minded as we were, it did not occur to us that the door marked 483 1/2 would have anything to do with the promised land within until some helpful person wearing an apron emerged from that very door and suggested we might be looking for a table, for two?\\n\\nAtmosphere: The music was just audible enough to be identifiable (I can testify to hearing a cover of Bowie's \\"Heroes\\") but not too loud at all. Decor: A mix of light wood, focused lighting leaving lots of shadows, real candles . . . and the bench I was sitting on was illuminated from beneath. (Not by candles.)\\n\\nThe drinks were delicious. My friend drank glass after glass of the Pinot Nero and was very happy with it, while I started with a cocktail: The Only William -- a new drink for me so I can't say whether it was a perfect example of its genre, but there was nothing disproportionate about the way it was made and I imbibed it with gusto. With dinner I had a Cabernet S. that was suggested by our server based on my food choice and turned out to be a perfect complement.\\n\\nOur appetizer was the cheese plate. It was the cheese-of-the-[day/week? -- in this case a nice and fresh chevre-y thing, herb-sprinkled] plus cheese accessories (slightly toasted little circles of bread, honey-coated almonds, and a fruity spread). Yummy.\\n\\nMy friend's dinner was the Chorizo Burger (two sliders) and a brussels sprouts side. He was happy with both and praised the sprouts especially. I tasted the sprouts. What do they do to them? They're so good.\\n\\nFor me: arugula salad (+ beets, walnuts, some cheese, it's a bit hazy -- and sardines) and the Oaxacan Hanger Steak. I ordered the steak rare and (!) got it that way. So so so good.\\n\\nDessert: There was no printed dessert menu; our server told us about the three desserts on offer that night. Whatever I got, it was amazing: creme-y, in a cup, topped with some kind of (brulee-y?) raspberry layer.\\n\\nOur server was attentive all evening, one step ahead of us without rushing us. When we were leaving and wanted to take a cab back downtown (instead of walking, which is how we'd gotten there), they were gracious enough to call one and talk to us about Atlanta nightlife while we waited for it to show up.\\n\\nApparently they clear out (some of) the tables around 10:30 or so towards the end of dinner time, bring in a DJ, and give the place over to dancing for the rest of the night.

Next we were pleasantly surprised by the finger licking flavor of the Saigon Brussel Sprouts, the sauce that coats them is out of this world and they were browned perfectly.

I ordered fried green tomatoes and a waffle (yes, 1 big waffle). The fried tomatoes tasted boxed, and over-breaded. They were definitely not fresh.  This is tomato season in GA so I expected better. The tomatoes were served with some sort of tasteless runny sauce, that appeared to be mixed with water in order to stretch it.  The waffle was good. It was no better or worse than waffles I make at home. And, that's the point. There was nothing that I was served that I could not have prepared as well or better in my own kitchen. When I dine out, whether for lunch, brunch or dinner, I need an experience, not just food slapped on a dish.

That is - vegetarian but no onions, garlic, leeks, chives, shallots, etc. \\n\\nThe place was packed. On Monday. I guess? We actually got a large table in the covered patio within 10 minutes but it got pretty warm quickly, despite the fans, which also had the side effect of making things like napkins fly around. It's obviously not as clean outside. The syrup container that was later brought out to us was sticky and the individual Smuckers jam in the little containers were sticky as well, likely from having syrup dropped on them from previous patrons. They did ask if it was all right to sit outside and gave us a preview but we were on a tight schedule so we okay'ed it, thinking we'd quickly order, eat, and go. \\n\\nThere were a few tables outside.

When we finally got the chance to go through everything, a lot of things were off limits and she said there's actually not much there that would fit us. Boo. She seemed a little impatient but it could be because a few other of her tables were almost done.

My favorites were the ones with the lemon sour cream sauce - the enchilada and magnolia omelette, mainly because there was a different dimension to them. They were all pretty standard fare though. The cornbread pancake was interesting though gritty, which everyone wasn't too fond of; they preferred buttermilk. \\n\\nMy impression? It was okay? Definitely not speedy. Outside is better in cooler weather in my opinion, not that we get much perfect weather. For no allium vegetarians, there are a few choices but you're still pretty limited. There is the perk of that single sauce though. Service was initially nice but I felt like our restrictions were taking it's toll on our waitress. Parking is a little limited (they have a personal lot but it's not the biggest, especially during high traffic hours and if no one carpooled) but seemed okay for the most part. \\n\\nAt least our waitress now knows what other no allium vegetarians can eat at Magnolia Cafe if she gets them as a table. Happy I can have enchiladas even though it was the only interesting item. \\n\\nAND there's a note that it'll be a $0.50 charge for substitutions on the menu. Our total bill was $75 but the details weren't on it so I'm not sure if we were billed for any changes; too bad we don't get a $0.50 discount for every ingredient we remove. ;) The good thing about sitting outside: not many care that your babies/kids start making a lot of noise because there's a lot of waiting involved.

We frequent this place often because of the awesome environment, delicious hot comfort food, beer wheel (you'll hear more about that later) and friendly staff. While Redbones offers a dining area, we always sit at the bar upstairs. This, in my opinion, is where the action is. You may have to stay for a while before getting seats but I promise it's worth the wait. The bartenders recognize us and always are able to provide great recommendations if we opt not to utilize the wheel. What is this wheel you ask? It's a wheel of fortune wheel that lands on a number. This number corresponds with a beer (huge beer selection). You have to drink the beer you are given....while this sounds risky, it really makes it a fun experience. The food is delicious.... I go between the pulled pork sandwich and the buffalo wings. The hush puppies are also to die for. They offer a million different ways to eat meat...what's not to love?

This one has involved some thought, mainly on the star level.  In short, if a place is relatively inexpensive, I tend to round up on stars.  If it's a higher price point and/or aspiring to be a bit more upscale, I round down on stars due to increased expectations.  Hence, a three star review for Blue Star.\\n\\nFirst of all, I love the atmosphere and service.  It's casual, yet refined.  It's not pretentious and the staff takes great care of you.\\n\\nI came in last night wanting to try the burger as I'd heard great things about it.  Honestly, it underwhelmed in some aspects.  On the positive side, the burger ingredients were exceptionally high quality.  They also have a long list of items that you can add to customize your burger.  The negatives were twofold.  The hickory burger was remarkably devoid of hickory sauce.  I tend to prefer a messy, drippy hickory burger, but even taking that into account, there was no hint of sauce, except for a slightly smoky taste that could've even just been the grilled flavor.  Second, the fries were as overseasoned as the burger was under-sauced.  The fries were overwhelmed with the seasoning that the kitchen applied -- possibly seasoned salt?  I left a good portion of the fries.\\n\\nFinally, on my personal pet peeve for a restaurant -- iced tea.  Blue Star only provides Splenda and sugar for their tea.  The lack of other artificial sweeteners may be a nod to the hip vibe from the Rosedale area as well as the choice of a local soft drink (Maine Root).  But for me, even with bringing my own Sweet N Low, the iced tea could use some work."},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Holy moly the drinks here are good!

It was not very busy yet the food took FOR-E-VER to come out. (It was not until 10pm before we left  - a 3 hour dinner and we only had two glasses of wine each). The starter was incredible - bruschetta with meat and cheese and truffle oil, I died. So good. Entree was a lasagna that was just OK - it was VERY rich and for $19 a slice I expected some pretty amazing lasagna. Dessert was the clear winner  - walnut creme brulee with strawberries was very delicious. They mixed up my order however so I had to wait 20 minutes while they cooked my food while everyone else had their dinner. One of my friends hated her entree so she just ordered a few more starters to have as an entree instead but they forgot the order all together - at least they comp'ed it for her in the end (if they hadn't, I would have given the service 2/5 stars)\\n\\nI've heard this place is usually very good so I'm just wondering if I experienced yet another disaster of a Portland Dining Month experience.

I had a simple ceasar sald with homemade dressing and the house smoked salmon (if nothing else, visit just for that divine salmon!) and a cup of soup.  Sure, they don't have a lot of menu options, but it's wordly cuisine that's Americanized and healthy.

There's a remnant of a drive-through which appears to still be in operation.\\n\\nI've eaten here before, coincidentally on both occasions it was with my usual Buford Highway Restaurant Crawler group - this second time was much better than the first (the first time there was a rather unpleasant sewer backup going on and the smell was hard to get past). You order at the counter at Taqueria Los Rayos and then pick up the food as it comes up. On this Wednesday evening there was on person at the counter and one in back - otherwise it was empty. As with other local area Latino joints, this place caters to the many who live in the nearby apartments and can easily walk by. \\n\\nThe food here is fairly authentic - very typical of what you might find in Mexico City or elsewhere in central Mexico. The tacos are double wrapped in corn tortillas and have a hefty serving. I had this meat plate - don't remember what it's called on the menu but it had beef, pork and bacon with sides. Good but a bit much for a single serving. Make sure you order a Mexican Coke with your meal - a bit of a given - you can thank me later.\\n\\nService here is quite good if sparse - I think everyone enjoyed their food.

I'd recommend to share this because it is super filling and pretty big. Plus it gives you more room to try other things.\\n\\nSPANISH OCTOPUS: To die for if you're an octopus fan! Nice grilled taste to it. It compliments nicely with the romesco. The romesco sauce was EVERYTHING. Literally licking the plate of it. \\n\\nSCALLOPS CRUDO: You can't go wrong with scallops. However, I prefer my scallops grilled/cooked and bigger. The crudo is delicious and there definitely won't be any regrets trying it as it was super refreshing, but honestly, could totally live without trying it. \\n\\nNORTH END CIOPPINO: My friend ordered this stew and it's a lot like a paella just with broth. If you're lobstered out, I'd totally get this. You get a variety of seafood in there and if you're big seafood fan this is the way to go. However, the portions are big. I'd recommend sharing this. \\n\\nOYSTERS: Ok, so I know some are like \\"the oysters are super small..\\" They're small because of where these oysters are from. I got the Kusshi, Kumamoto, and Island Creek. If you are a big oyster fan then size doesn't matter (insert immature chuckle here). It is the taste you're after and of course good oysters come with a price ($3-5 an oyster). Kusshi and Kumamoto is a MUST try. While the serving is small, the taste is fabulous. \\n\\nWe don't get this quality and freshness in Las Vegas so when we can get good oysters we're all in (insert drumroll. pun totally intended). \\n\\nLAST ADVICE:\\n Entree portions are BIG. So unless you've got an appetite for 2 people, order your own. However, there's so much to try so I recommend SHARING to try a bunch of stuff. \\n\\nDON\\"T BRING ANYTHING TO GO if you plan on walking around because you'll throw the food out anyways. So EAT EVERYTHING.\\n\\nPUT YOUR NAME ON THE WAITLIST and then spend an hour walking some of the Freedom Trail points across the street as well as check out the Public Market. You'll have plenty of time and THEY CALL YOU 15 minutes prior to your table being ready. \\n\\nAgain...NO RESERVATIONS HERE! They also CLOSE their list 2 HOURS prior to closing. \\n\\nGO WHEN IT OPENS AT 11:30 AM!"},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been searching all around Austin for someone who actually knows what it means to be gluten-free- these guys have it down!

With families in their suburban dressed best, we plopped down with sand in our breasts and I am sure reeking of alcohal and ocean and giant bags of wet towels and everyone was cool with it. \\n\\nWe each got to pick oysters from a long list like when you order sushi, and the prices can start to rack up. But I had never really had oysters before (only started eating seafood about a year ago) but I was in a very special place. Served on a large plate of ice and two kinds of sauce, I also ordered a very simple large shrimp cocktail for myself. I loved one so much, the Nova Scotia one I think, I ordered one more for myself and they served on a tiny little plate of ice and wedge of lemon-god I just love small miniture things! I also shared the PEI Mussels with Angel and they were damned tasy-recommend getting hot bread to sop up the buttery sauce (although I still love Central Kitchens Mussels the best). We ordered some kind of peach nectar and champagne drinks, and the eel and yellowtail salad one woman had was amazing (like sushi...in a salad!) and another one had a real delicate salmon salad that hit the spot.\\n\\nThe waitresses were totally chill and competentant.

The inside was dead at 1:30/2, so we basically had it to ourselves. We sat in the bar at one of the high top tables, perfect for the two of us.  The bartender was serving as our waitress as well and came over almost immediately. She briefly explained the menu to us and that the menu is changed daily due to the fact that they buy their goods from local suppliers/farmers. We started with drinks, I got the Jack Rose cocktail which was a brandy and in house made grenadine drink. My boyfriend got he Farmers Lemonade which was vodka and a blueberry lemonade. Both were good, sweet and measured out but good. We got the 6hr meatball app to share.  While they were good meatballs, I can't say I was overly impressed or saw the point of cooking them for 6hrs. I do have to say the accompanying sauce and focaccia bread were both excellent.  For dinner I got the Fettuccine al Ragu which was homemade fettuccini noodles with a pork and beef pecorino ragu sauce. The noodles were great and you could tell the freshness. The sauce wasn't a hit with me, mainly because the flavor of the pecorino cheese was too overpowering, it was pretty much all you could taste.  It's just too strong/sharp/smokey of a cheese to have that be the only flavoring. My bf got the Beef Ravioli. These came with large roasted tomatoes that looked amazing. He did say that the tomatoes were the best part of the meal, which is saying a lot for a guy that LOVES ravilois, especially homemade. His meal looked great, but when he cut into the raviloi the meat inside looked like something you'd find in a Chef Boyardee ravioli, unappealing to say the least. All in all, the entire experience was ok. The atmosphere was great and would be a bar I'd go back to for a few drinks with friends but I would think twice about eating there again. For what we got, I did not feel it was worth what we paid.  4 drinks, 1 app and 2 entrees for a total of $120 (including tip).

How my palate changed in those 4 years!\\n\\nHeading over to my local Tibby's after returning to Orlando last week, I couldn't wait to enjoy an authentic seafood gumbo. While it came with shrimp, a few baby oysters and okra in a light roux gravy I found it bland in comparison, plus New Orleans' signature Blue crab and andouille sausage were both missing from this seafood gumbo.\\n\\nI spoke with an assistant manager who explained the reasons for the missing crab (customers don't like dealing with pieces of shell) and andouille (Tibby's chops it up very finely, unlike the large pieces included in NOLA gumbos - apparently I missed the one tiny piece in my bowl) and the reduction in Cajun spiciness (Orlando customers apparently prefer less \\"heat\\" ....really?) He then referred me to the red pepper shaker on the table  if I wanted more heat... no, absolutely NOT the same as a variety of gumbo spices).  He was polite but defensive, but the very attentive waiter was great and we briefly discussed the merits of light vs dark roux :)\\n\\n I'll certainly be back with a friend but won't be ordering any more gumbo."},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I eat here every time that I'm in town visiting.

That's what I got this weekend and it was fine. Not great. Fine. Maybe that's my problem in that I don't order one of their other special burgers. We got seated within 20 minutes but it took 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. All the servers share tables so we don't have one specific person. That's nice but annoying when you have 10 different people ask you if you want a refill and interrupt your conversations.\\n\\nPrices are fine, atmosphere is fine except that their waiting area would double the size of their restaurant if they took out all the nonsense like video games to occupy your time while you wait.

The soup had a nice, strong tomato flavor. It was pleasantly spiced without being overbearing. The sandwich, which I got supposedly on pepperjack break (couldn't really taste the pepperjack part), was a good, fresh sandwich, though nothing out of this world. Darwin's can't do grilled or pressed sandwiches; the best they can do if you want it hot, according to the person who took my order is to microwave the turkey. Traditional but unfortunate.

Neptunes lobster roll consists of a soft bun, filled to the brim with buttered, tender lobster meat.  Folks, you can make this by yourself at home.  All you need is a big soft hot dog bun, some butter and a lot of lobster meat.  Neptunes lobster roll had well cooked lobster meat ( again you can do this yourself too...) and a lot of it...I'm guessing the quantity of the lobster meat is why Neptunes comes out on top.  To be honest, you can cook more tender lobster meat at home where you can better control the tenderness of your lobster.  Neptunes lobster was tender but still not tender enough.  The lobster claw tips should be so tender that they are soft and melt in your mouth.  For my meal, I also had Jonnycakes and the oyster piggyback.  They were good, but if I could redo my meal, I would skip the hot food...yes I would even skip the famous lobster roll ( in fact, that's the first thing I would skip)... And just slurp Cotuit oysters for my meal.  Cotuit oysters = mouthgasm.  I tried one and it was so fantastic I had to get two more.

I had heard great things, so I waited for almost two hours for a table, expecting really great barbeque, but apparently it wasn't meant to be.\\n\\nFrom looking at the menu, Redbones seemed to have a good selection of BBQ and sides. They also had a really great selection of craft beer and bourbon. We started with the corn fritters, which were really good, so I had high hopes for the BBQ.\\n\\nI ordered a combo platter that included pulled pork and Texas-style beef ribs, which I am usually crazy about. However, Redbones' preparation seriously left something to be desired. The pulled pork was OK, but definitely nothing special. The meat was kind of dry and not very flavorful, but it was at least acceptable. But the ribs were really terrible. You could tell that the ribs had not been slow-cooked because the fat had not fully rendered, leaving them chewy and stringy. As bad as this was, I could at least excuse it if not for the fact that they had obviously used liquid smoke to flavor the ribs. I thought I must have been imagining it, but when I got a look at Redbones' \\"smoker\\" I wasn't surprised. It appears that there is not an actual smoke pit, but just a rack for the BBQ to sit on over an open flame that is not enclosed at all to provide a smoky flavor. This explains the need for liquid smoke and the poor texture of the ribs.\\n\\nIf the food had been great I could have forgiven the incredibly long wait and the sub-par service (I ordered three beers that I was later told were not in stock before I actually had one delivered to me). However, the food was not very good at all. This could make a great bar if they kept the great beer and bourbon list and stuck to bar food like the corn fritters, but they are way out of their league when it comes to barbeque."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is simply amazing.

I would say it has the right amount of sweetness in it. The pad see ew was awesome! I love how the noodles were made! They looked burned at first when i saw them, but they weren't and they were very soft. It also has a little bit of soup or juice in it which keeps it from looking dry. The Tom Kah soup on the other was my favorite! It was sour and sweet at the same time. It wasn't too sour like the other tom kah soups i had from other Thai restaurants. It was the best ever! We ordered other dishes as well, but I only mentioned my favorites in here because it would be too much to explain all of them here. Though overall, all of the foods we ordered was amazing, appetizing, magnificent, mouthwatering, majestically awesome! It was just splendid! If you think i am exaggerating, you must go and just try it yourself because no kidding, this restaurant is just amazing! From the food to the employees (owner of the restaurant).\\nJust to add more, the employees were also great! It is a family restaurant and is run by the owner (chef) and her husband. They were very friendly as the husband even spoke to us about their restaurant and a little bit about their life. It was a good chitchat while we devour the good dishes they served us lol even the chef herself came out and spoke to us!

A safe choice for dessert. \\n\\nI didn't like the fact that the tables were so close together in the front dining area on the first floor. The people beside you could easily hear your conversations, like they did with mine. Also, when the servers were coming to talk to the diners beside us, they would literally be grazing against us; and vice versa for the neighbouring diners.

Mixed in with the wine and drink/dessert menu, it was a bit much. \\n\\nLastly, it's super noisy in here (at dinner), so if you want a relaxing, mellow time...try some place else.

My order cost about 45 dollars and was delivered at 10:40. I dont have a problem with the wait or the price. good food should take time and cost some money and food is one of the areas where i am down to splurge, price wise. \\n\\nHere's where things start to go down hill. My pizza and whatnot arrived, i paid for the pizza and tipped the driver right around 5 dollars. When i brought the pizza out to the kitchen and opened up the box, i was immediatly heart broken. I dont know if the driver just too alot of left turns at high speed or if he simply held my pizza box side ways, but it was a mess. The cheese and toppings were all to one side of the pizza. 3 slices had basically no cheese or toppings, and most of the cheese was pooled up against the back of the pizza box, not even on the pizza AT ALL. I understand that pizza is hot and the cheese can slide around some in the delivery process, but this was pretty ridiculous. most of the cheese was not even on the pizza...\\n\\nalso, my girlfriend doesnt like red sauce, so we had ordered one of the build your own pizzas and asked for no sauce, but the pizza had sauce... i do have to say, once i spread the cheese and toppings back on the pizza as best i could, it was delicious. \\n\\n i loved the pizza, nice ingridients, great flavor, but i feel disrespected. As i said before, i have no problem spending money on good food, but they got my order wrong and they somehow man-handled my pizza. i feel like since they are offering a high quality product, and asking a high (for pizza, but reasonable considering the quality) price, they should take care in ALL aspects of their business, from food handling to making sure an order is in fact exactly what the customer ordered. \\n\\ni will try again, with my fingers crossed, everything was so tasty, i just wish id had a better expirience. if im spending 50 dollars at a pizza joint, i expect my order to be handled with care. \\n\\nas i side note, i didnt call to complain. if i had, im sure they would have helped me out. i didnt call because id placed the order an hour before close, pretty much, so when i got the pizza and took a look it was 10:45 and i dont think anything good ever comes out of a restaurant thats ordered 15 mins before close."},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"I ordered the fish and it was fantastic.

I want to say there were 6 or 7 salad/appetizer choices and 6 or 7 pies. We started with the escarole salad and five bean soup with bacon. Both dishes were full of flavor and set us up for what we had hoped would be some knockout pizza. \\n\\nOnce our pizzas arrived we were slightly disappointed. Both pies were almost all dough. Normally, neapolitan pizza is leveled flat and the few toppings are evenly distributed. Ours looked like there was a sink hole in the middle with all of the toppings resting on top. I'd guess the sauce and toppings stretched across 5 or 6 inches of the 12 inch pizzas. The pizzas at the other tables weren't consistent either. Some looked like the entire surface areas was covered while others looked like they had been served dough with just a dab of olive oil. Maybe something was going on in the kitchen, but it was really strange to see almost no consistency among the pies. \\n\\nI've heard how amazing the ice cream is, but I wasn't in the mood for sweets that evening.

I've been casually going there for years, and I don't have some major complaint, but I also don't love it the way all other Austinites seem to.\\nI am very cheap, so that's definitely a problem. And I like french fries, which causes more problems for me personally. However, for fans of home fries and cottage cheese who have money to burn, there is absolutely no better place. I keep going for the salad that has olives and avacado, the name of which escapes me. I can definitely say that this will keep you on a healthy diet.\\nThe staff has also been less than what I personally want. I've gotten both good and all right, but only every once and a while do I get really friendly people. But, on the other hand, one nice guy there pretended like it was normal when I ate a mini-omelette and then ordered a whole extra plate of eggs.

After being seated, we waited 15 minutes before anyone arrived to take our drink orders. It took us another hour to get food and eat it. Left at 4:30, glad to have experienced the food, but angry at the poor service and ridiculously long wait time. They claim to serve on a team system where every table is served by any server. But what happens is that no server has responsibility for any one table, so diners don't even know who to ask for a refill of water glasses... if a server happens to appear. Crowded, poorly lit dining area, also very noisy with music. A small neighborhood bar atmosphere with lots of history and character. Not so good for talking, but great for eating and drinking.\\nHaving said that, the burgers were excellent. 12 ounce patties with all the trimmings. Huge and wonderfully tasty! Clearly it is what keeps people coming back, for it is not the place or the service. I'd give Thurman Cafe an A+ for food, but a D for service and venue.

I was raised in Japan and I can definitely appreciate the authentic ramen and yakitori. My favorites are the oyako don (egg and chicken), beef bowl, katsu curry and spicy chicken bowl. My only complaint and thus the four stars instead of five is the manager- an older Japanese woman. She is so rude and grumpy ALL of the time. I've noticed turnover in the staff and can't help but wonder if she's to blame because of her nasty attitude. So while she's unpleasant and service is important to me, lucky for Yakitori Jinbei that I love the food and keep coming back."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"13586 Village Park Dr, Ste 306","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Pretty decent sushi and prices.

We ordered a variety of stuff starting with appetizers: mom ordered lobster bisque, my dad got the calamari and I got the apple salad.  Now, I normally don't really care for fruit in my salad but this one was delish!  I enjoyed the dressing that went with the salad but I couldn't find any candied pistachios like it said on the menu.  I didn't even think to say anything about it because the salad was so good and I didn't realize the missing pistachios until nearer to the end when I was eating a lot of the pumpkin seeds.  I didn't try my mom's soup but she drank the whole thing and the calamari was great!

Both do BBQ, but in very different styles.  I would recommend both for different reasons.  Go to Blue Ribbon if you want saturated flavor, great lemonade, and a quiet, speedy meal without much face-time with your friends.

Star Granted. \\n\\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nBiscuits and Gravy, while not overly complicated, often come at a premium these days, but biscuit sandwiches at Pine State Biscuits won't even run you into the double digits.

The piece of fried chicken was quality above all else, and it blended wonderfully with peppery gravy that was truly out of this world. Now, what was a bit odd was that I've actually had better biscuits. Mine had a bit too firm of a top and the inside was a bit clumpy as opposed to the buttery smooth texture that you can sometimes fine. However, all in all this was a really good sandwich. Single Star Granted.\\n\\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\\n\\nThere's a reason that Pine State Biscuits is such a Portland staple. The atmosphere, price, and product are all marvelous, and this would have easily been a five star review if I was simply a fan of biscuits and gravy.

Do I like the food? Yes. Do I like coming here? No. First off, the place is way too small, way too packed, and you usually can't even move without bumping into people. I'm slightly claustrophobic, so whenever I eat here, I almost feel like I'm trapped in a little cage and I can't escape. If you go to a place and already feel like leaving two minutes after you get there, that's not a good sign. The scary thing is, I typically go at a time when it isn't as busy, so I can only imagine how dreadful it must be during their peak hours.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the food is good, but like most trendy or chic places, they charge too much for portion sizes that are too small. I'm beginning to discover that the more you pay at a restaurant, the less food you actually get. I once got a breakfast biscuit that, when factoring the tip in, cost me over $10. I didn't even get a drink or a side with it. They do have a happy hour menu and you can strategically get items from that to build a somewhat reasonably priced meal, but the choices are very limited and they force you to sit in the bar for some reason (the bar, by the way, is even smaller and more cramped than the dining area.) Also, you can't get things from both the regular menu and the happy hour menu, you have to choose one or the other. So if you want to get The Alder Burger from the regular menu and get a side of hush puppies from the happy hour menu, you're out of luck. \\n\\nI'm not going to dock points from this place for the cost because I realize that different people have different incomes and what I consider expensive might be considered normal to someone else. However, I will dock points for the overly cramped layout and the simple fact that it's not giving you as much bang for your buck."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"After a lot of research on the best hot lobster roll in Boston, this place kept popping up.

Every once in a while you seem to get a zombie who doesn't seem to listen to your order and decides to just go through the motions, but thats few and far between now. The restaurant is clean and \\n\\nYou'll notice I only gave 4 stars, this is due to the parking and line situation at the restaurant... Typically during peak hours the line is out the door, not the teams fault, more that this location gets a lot of foot traffic (maybe another location close by could cut down on this *hint hint*). The parking lot is a complete nightmare, luckily I live close enough to where I can order online and walk to pick up my order, but I believe it falls on the management of this location to keep people from turning that tiny parking lot into a demolition derby. Too often do you see people squeezing their cars in front of the dumpsters or alongside the windows, making it a real pain to try and get out of their parking spots. I mean, when the newly renovated Taco Bell next door has a better parking arrangement, thats an issue. I will say there is always parking on 6th so if you run into a jammed lot just go park and walk. \\n\\nOverall the team at this location has greatly improved and its enough of an improvement to warrant an update. Go team Grandview! Now just start taking applications for a traffic officer to take care of that mess of a parking lot and you can get that 5th star."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Very upscale and classy.

They were not \\"hot\\" at all....could be hot to someone else but I'm used to wayyy hotter food. The Cajun fries were delicious! The house made bleu cheese dressing also had a good taste.

I told him I wanted it hot, and he gave me the usual \\"are you sure, you look pretty white to me, I am not sure if you will like it\\" look, but I said bring it on. And they did! I love it when a restaurant actually listens to me when I tell them I like spicy food instead of assuming I can't handle the heat. I thought it was perfect (and my boyfriend thought it was way too hot). I got 4 veggie balls instead of the standard 3. Yum. The bf got the lamb curry, mild, which he really enjoyed. We also got some peshwari naan, which was super sweet and buttery. It was a great compliment to my spicy dish.\\n\\nThe waiter came by often to refill our water, check to make sure I was happy with my meal, and joke about how he doesn't like spicy food at all.

I swear half of the tourists in Boston are here just because of the reputation that this place has on yelp. That means big crowds, and long waits. Was it worth it? Read on reader! \\n\\nI was in full on tourist mode, and I managed to get up and get myself there EARLY Saturday, at around 11am.  I am NOT a morning person. I was told that there would be an hour wait. This really wasn't an issue for me, since I wasn't even hungry. The place was already packed at 11 so it was clear that the wait was warranted. There was physical no place for me to even stand.  I appreciated that they take your cell and call you when your table is ready. Without this system, I can imagine a lot of hurt feelings. \\n\\nI was with my Dad, perhaps the least \\"foodiest\\" person on the planet. He is a 60 year old man from Pennsylvania. He has no business in a place like this. That said, he was cool to walk around for an hour and we actually had a nice time looking at some of the nearby Freedom Trail stuff. Paul Revere's church is right around the corner. \\n\\nAfter an hour wait, we were called and walked back to the Neptune Oyster. It might have been more like an hour and 15, but I really can't complain. I think they did a good job with taking names. \\n\\n I will say that their door is kind of dangerous. They had a chain there across the floor that my Dad almost face planted on. Like an old timey metal chain.  That's really my only complaint. \\n\\nWe were seated promptly and the wait staff did an excellent job dealing with the crowds of people, at an ITTY BITTY little restaurant. \\n\\nOn to the food! The oysters were fantastic. The clams were great.  Everything tasted super fresh. I had one or 2 of 5-6 different oysters, and I couldn't really distinguish them. I just liked the ones that were listed as medium salty better than the very high salt ones. \\n\\nI had a bowl of clam chowder. The chowder was good, but a little soupier than I would have liked. Some more potatoes and clams would have been nice.\\n\\n I had the lobster roll (hot) as my entree. This was probably the best lobster roll I've ever had. So much lobster meat. I could have made 2 lobster rolls out of what was on the 1. Simply fantastic. \\n\\nThe fries were only so so though, I wish you could switch the fries out for something else. They really didn't fit with all the trendy sea food items.  \\n\\nAll in all the food was fantastic and worth a wait of an hour or so.

The food appeared fresh, not shriveled or greasy, I enjoyed most of the ones I tried. So health-wise it didn't send up red flags. A wide variety to choose from, even sushi. Waitress was friendly. The texture of the crab meat was chalky though, disappointing. Probably the added flash fry was too much for it. The black bean clams, steamed whole fish and mussels on the other hand, were tasty & fresh.\\n\\nWesternized Chinese fare make up most of the buffet (eg General Tsao's chicken, sweet and sour pork etc) but there were other variations & options (eg dumplings, yellow rice, salt and pepper shrimp etc), and there was even a vietnamese pho noodle bar also. Though you can't really compare the quality & flavor to some of the independent eateries around, as far as buffets go, it's one of the better choices if you're going that route, especially if you have kids or a large group  for the (lunch) price of $10.99/person it's an excellent value."},{"name":"Wing Depot","address":"3644 Campbellton Rd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Ask for drums as there is so little meat on other wings you will starve to death.

This was the first time I've tried out a franchise on this side of the Pacific, and I hoped that the experience would be the same as back in China. \\n\\nIt was not. \\n\\nQuite unlike mainland China, Little Sheep in Vancouver has air conditioning. This changes the complexion of the restaurant, or more precisely, your own face, rather dramatically. For the first time ever, I cooked my meats and veggies, ate my fill, drank my beer, and walked out of the place without a drop of sweat on my body. \\n\\nFor this reason alone, I can affirmatively state that Little Sheep Vancouver is nothing at all like Little Sheep in China; it is a completely unauthentic experience. Other than the fact that the broth tastes just as good as in China, the meats and veggies are perhaps higher quality, and the service the one American guy in the whole place receives is great, the fact that I walked out without my shirt plastered to my body with sweat from a 400-degree bowl of boiling broth in a 100-degree ambient heat and 99% humidity of Shenzhen summer left me feeling cheated. \\n\\nI demand, for the sake of the authentic Little Sheep experience, that this location cease with their airconditioning of the establishment, and instead turn on heaters that blow incessantly upon all patrons to the point of stroke and exhaustion.

I originally wanted to come here for my birthday dinner, since it is a nice, classy establishment with lots of seating. If you want to reserve seats for a large group here, you have to reserve ahead of time - 1 month before! This place is very popular for groups, and you should confirm with the restaurant again closer to the date in case it does not work out. \\n\\nThe first time, we had spaghetti alle vongole (with clams), beef carpaccio, calamari, a pizza, spaghetti carbonara, and their classic meatball spaghetti.  I personally did not like the spaghetti with clams, since there was a heavy flavor of the clams, though I was glad that there was no sand in them (I've had bad experiences with clams in restaurants before). They provided a bowl for me to de-shell the clams myself, and there were a lot of them! The pizza looked like a regular italian-style pizza, nothing special or interesting about it. Beef carpaccio was great, though not great enough to warrant me to purchase it again. Maybe I'd get the calamari, which came with a unique tomato-based sauce. The spaghetti carbonara and classic meatball spaghetti were absolutely amazing, from what I've heard and tried myself. Dang, that spaghetti carbonara! \\n\\nThe second time was a group set menu uniquely designed for us. We had complimentary bread and olive oil & balsamic vinegar (?), followed by their most famous meatballs spaghetti with truffle cream. Absolutely divine. Meatballs were tender, and the truffle cream added a perfect richness to the pasta. The portion looked small, but we couldn't finish it! This was followed by tiramisu for dessert.

So I am still stunned at the \\"gumbo\\" I was served at Tibbys. \\nFirst, and really inexcusable, it was lukewarm.   \\nAnd it was the color of watered down canned mushroom soup. Pale, bland. No roux ever came near this gumbo.\\nSeafood? Several pieces of shrimp; no fish, no oysters. Some particles of onion,  pepper and celery. Minced? \\nWhite rice! The one ingredient that was right . . and plenty of it. Rice soup comes to mind. Lukewarm rice soup. \\nAgain, I am disappointed because I want to like this place!! The service was good, salad was delicious. But there was no love in the gumbo."},{"name":"Olive Bistro","address":"3230 Cobb Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place made me a believer in lamb chops.\\n\\nThe lamb chops in the past weren't great.

The service was so good I am rounding up to give PCG a 5 star review.  We arrived around 7:15 for a 7:30 reservation.  We had to wait a bit for the table to be set up, but since we were early that's not a problem.  As other Yelpers note, the views are gorgeous.  We had the best of both worlds, as the sun was still up when we arrived, but by the time our meal had ended, the sun was down and the city was lit up.  Very cool views of Mt. Hood and the river, in addition to the city in general.  The restaurant itself is large, with plenty of seating as well as a large bar.  It was very energetic on the Friday night we ate at PCG.  I brought my 5 year old son because I wanted him to see the views.  At first I was nervous about having a child so young at a fancy restaurant, but the hostess informed me children dined at PCG regularly.  After we sat down and I began to look around, I noticed several children, including many younger than my son.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, we met our server.  I can't recall her name, but she was fantastic. She was funny, very prompt, but not overbearing.  She was there when we needed her but allowed us to enjoy our meal without too many theatrics.  Bottles of wine came quickly, as did refills for water.  She offered us a couple of recommendations for the menu as well, and we were pleased with her suggestions.  A+ service.\\n\\nWe started with the duck confit steamed buns and the cheese plate.  I also had the clam chowder.  The duck was served as a leg, which meant we had to tear the meat off of it to make our own steamed bun.  This was pretty unwieldy, and while the duck was very good, I wouldn't order this dish again.  It was difficult to share.  The cheese plate was fantastic.  Each selection (there were 3) is served with an accompaniment.  Additionally, there was a little card explaining each cheese and accompaniment.  I loved this touch, anytime I order a cheese plate or charcuterie, the server explains what is one there, and the table is always half paying attention and forgets.  It was nice to have the cheat sheet.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was very good.  The server joked that it was served with bacon and more bacon, but this was accurate.  It's loaded with bacon.  The soup had a darker hue that New England clam chowders typically have.  It was seasoned very well, and in addition to the bacon, it was served with a lot of clams and potatoes.  I was disappointed I only got the cup, this was a fantastic soup.  No extra seasoning needed.\\n\\nFor my entree, I went with the shallot glazed short rib, which is served with tomatoes and mashed potatoes.  I also had a bite of the ribeye and honey-brined pork tenderloin and the table shared an order of mac and cheese.  The short rib was, as they are supposed to be, fork tender.  It may have been slightly overcooked, but it wasn't awful.  It still remained juicy and incredibly moist.  I loved the glaze.  The potatoes and roasted tomatoes were fine, but the star was (appropriately) the short rib.\\n\\nThe ribeye was good, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The pork tenderloin was surprisingly good.  It was moist, and the brine imparts a great flavor.  It was slightly sweet, but also seasoned well.  It was a strong dish.  The mac n cheese was a table favorite.  Served with a white cheese sauce and a bread crumb topping, it was very cheesy, but not overpowering or greasy.  The pasta was al dente and retained some bite to it.  It was a very good mac n cheese, absolute re-order.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had a port (recommended by the server) and the table shared a slice of enormous chocolate cake.  It was very good, fluffy and the icing was thick and sweet but not too much of either.  As I said, it's immense, easily shareable.\\n\\nI was surprised by my evening at PCG.  It's an old school place that is known for its views, but I would argue it could equally be as known for its food.  I would return on a future trip to Portland."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"39 John F Kennedy St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I really don't like the obnoxious Hispanic dude that seems to run the front of this place but the food is amazing.

It was on the Gay Pride weekend. The street was full of people and we thought it would be a good oppertunity to try it out as there are a lot of events to see.\\n\\n- Would we go back again? No! \\n\\n- Over all Impression: The lady-owner person seems only being \\"nice\\" to you towards to the end when you are about to pay & only shows her \\"efficiency\\" when you order something that would cost you money.

We had asked for 2nd serving of the drink as well as 2 glasses of water. The drink (beer) came right away but the 2 glasses of water for some reason just would not come. So we had to ask her again for the water about 15 mins. later..............waited for a looooooong time, the water still no where to be seen........and there I was getting slowly dehydrated from the salty dishes, my boyfriend had to get up and go up to the bar to ask the nice girl at the bar for the water. (Meanwhile, the lady-owner who serves us saw he got the water himself and maybe realizes we've been waiting long enough.)\\n\\nDuring the meal, the lady-owner never came and checked with us if everything was okay, and it was just a very unpleasant to be served by her, no smiles or friendliness in her whatsoever. At the end of the meal, she FINALLY came to us and with a (fake?) smile asking, \\"Would you like any dessert or anything else?\\" We said no and asked for the bill, WHICH IS ANOTHER LOOOOOOOOONG WAIT!! She walked pass us for so many times and I was holding the card waiting to pay and she never once brought the bill over, we waited for about 20 mins. to finally get the bill and I asked her if I could just pay right then. Her replied was, \\"Oh, I have to go get the machine.\\" You would think she would just come with the machine after that 20 mins.\\nAt the end, we were just really tired of waiting and seems like just wasting all the good sunny day sitting in there to have her get herself organized, so we paid with cash and left.\\n\\nI understand it's a busy weekend but there's no excuse for her poorly customer service because the nice young man who brought our food was friendly and pleasant.

We arrived at Pine State on a Saturday at about 11 to find a line around the corner.  Okay, fine - I normally won't wait for food, but we were on vacation, Pine State was highly recommeded, and it felt like something we had to do.  Plus the line seemed to be moving quickly.  And it was...we were up to the counter in about 20 minutes.  I ordered The Reggie Deluxe (fried chicken, egg, bacon, cheese, and gravy).  My boyfriend ordered The Wedgie and we got hash browns to share.  The lady at the counter warned us it would take a few minutes to get our food.  Fortunately an outside table opened up right at this time, so we grabbed it to soak up some of the very little Portland sunshine we experienced during our trip.  I filled up my mug with (AMAZING) Stumptown coffee and we settled in to wait.\\n\\nAnd wait. And wait.  By the time our names were finally called it was almost exactly 1 hour since we'd first gotten in line.  By this point I'd decided nothing was going to be good enough to justify this wait and, despite the free flowing coffee, was thoroughly grouchy.  Then I took a bite of my sandwich and...man.  I mean,  I know it's not that hard to make fried chicken, biscuits, and other horrible for you things taste good but this sandwich was amazing.  There was ample gravy which mixed with the yolk of the egg to make some kind of heavenly sauce.  I polished the sandwich off in record time and felt stuff to exploding (these sandwiches look small, but I assure you, one is more than enough).\\n\\nNow for the bad - the hash browns were totally pedestrian.  I took two bites of them and abandoned them as not being worth the calories or precious stomach room.  My boyfriend's Wedgie (hehe, that sounds gross) was significantly less delicious than my sandwich.  It suffered from the lack of gravy.  And, of course, the wait.

Let me count the ways: \\n1) The menu is perfect and focuses on fresh seafood with an emphasis on tasty oysters. I've had east coast oysters like Malpeques and Blue Points to the west coast varieties like Kumamoto and Fanny Bay. It's all good. \\n2) Hot lobster roll with butter on a toasted roll. Hot diggity damn do I love this and I'm from Maine! I grew up a lobster roll traditionalist -- lobster, a bit of mayo, and a toasted hot dog bun is what I had considered to be the bomb, but the hot lobster roll at Neptune Oyster is awesome. And for those times when I am feeling a bit traditional they do offer a cold lobster roll with mayo (not as good in my opinion though). \\n3) Olive oil shallot mignonette for your oysters --hey you are in the North End after all so this mignonette really represents your location. I thought it was weird the first time I tried it, but now I kind of like it. It adds a nice flavor with my oysters. \\n4) Try their daily specials -- lobster spaghettini, fritto misto, risotto...c'mon this ain't some leftover crap you'd get at most restaurants. Their specials are GOOD and again fresh. They often sell out!! \\n5) Wine list -- by the glass, by the half bottle, or by the bottle. From fairly inexpensive to much to much for my budget they have a great selection and the staff don't bat an eye if you order the $29 bottle of white or the $100 of red. \\n6) The staff are really quite unpretentious here which is a rarity. They are friendly and move quickly and are unassuming and make suggestions are the right time. \\n\\nI could keep going, but here is what I recommend you do:\\nWalk to the T. Get on said T and head to Government Center or Haymarket (your choice). Walk from T to the North End, Salem Street to be exact. Go into Neptune Oyster. Order a dozen (to start) of east and west coast oysters. Order a glass of wine or even a bellini. Order a hot lobster roll. Sit back, slurp, drink, repeat!!  Order more oysters.  Have another drink.

Prices were on the medium to higher side.  The restaurant service was good.\\n\\nThe service in the Karaoke bar, however, was terrible.  Within minutes of sitting down, we were told that there would be a minimum charge of $5 per person.  We said no problem, as we were planning to drink.  About half of us ordered drinks or snacks.  Most of us just ate at the restaurant.  The others wanted to wait and sing first.  The server again advised us that there is a minimum $5 charge per person, which we replied \\"Yes we know, that's fine.  We are going to order more, but not right now\\"  Though out the rest of the night, more of our friend showed up, and the server constantly hovered around us and harassed us about the minimum charge.  We all found this extremely classless and poor service.  We spoke with the bartender and finally they left us alone.  By the end of the night, the minimum charge was not a problem as we spent much more.  The kicker was that they tried to slap a mandatory 15% gratuity charge on our bill, although we were under the minimum amount of people required for a group.  \\n\\nI don't usually write bad reviews, but I felt that this was necessary so others who plan to go here for karaoke know what they are getting into.

DH made reservations directly with the restaurant and not with Open Table as he had done in the past, requesting a table by a window.  Each time we use Open Table we usually end up with a great table and great service.   We were taken to a table, which I must say must be the absolutely worst table in the house - right by the kitchen (very noisy and busy).  This should be saved for people who show up without reservation and have been rude to the host.  We of course said we would prefer to wait for a window seat and were fortunate enough to get an awesome seat in the bar with a great view of the Willamette.  As DH was famished we did order the jumbo shrimp appetizer and, again, disappointment.  There was so much lettuce in the glass there was very little room for cocktail sauce and then when we asked for additional sauce we were given at least 3/4 cup of the stuff (one extreme to another).\\n\\nThen things started to turn around for us - I promise you there is a happy ending.  After about an hour our hostess in the bar noticed that we were unhappy (duh) and went to check on our table as DH had done a couple of times prior to that.  At last, 1 hr. 20 minutes later we were escorted to a wonderful table with a great waiter and had the delightful dinner we were anticipating all along.  DH would recommend the wedge salad, me the cioppino (yum) and both the rack of lamb.  The halibut was a little salty so just be aware if you choose to order it.

The service ws great. The waitresses are very freindly and always smiling, even the ones that weren't serving us. The drinks were fat with alcohol and the appetizers are pretty good, not great, but good. The trivia is what made this place most memorable for me. It gave off a really communal feeling for me among the patrons. Though, given the amount of people that were there that night I can imagine that this place would be way too crowded on a weekend night and the parking is murder (as always in the south end) on a weekday nevermind the weekend.

Our server wasn't the greatest but it was great company and equally magnificent food.  Of course every Mexican restaurant experience starts with chips and salsa and theirs was awesome.  Could tell the salsa was not canned just a hint of heat and great texture.  Loved it.  I had a combination plate  Although the  entire plate was delectible I must say the enchiladas stood out.  Beef with a red sauce that was very rich and flavorful very authentic taste.  Chicken enchilada had a very nice light sauce on it and was delish!  Also a chimichanga that the chicken filling was seasoned very well and the cheese sauce had me wanting to lick my plate and honestly if either of my dining companions would have looked away for even a second I probably would have gone for it and licked that cheese sauce right off.  The black beans were wonderful.  Rich flavor with beans perfectly cooked nice side dish and very yummy.  The dish also came with a quesadilla and it was OK.  That was probably the weak link in the entire plate.  Just a nice white (probably chiuaha) cheese and a tortilla nothing else.  Overall a deliciously prepared meal.  Now for what I think was the best part.  My dining partner ordered a tamale as an appetizer   I thought this was odd as I've never seen him eat one before.  Turns out he wanted to order a chile rellano (that's what he gets for not asking me what he likes BUHAHA) so I got to eat half of it.  I swear my old friends grandmother from Guadelahara was back there making these things.  My taste buds just started singing and clouds parted and I saw visions of bull fights....  Ok so maybe I over exaggerate it but this truly was the best tamale I've had outside of my friends grandmother!!!   I wish I could get into Columbus more often to enjoy this place more.

I'd stay away from the jerk sauce though unless you want to test the consititutionof your stomach lining and tastebuds.  I have a high tollerace for spicy foods but that stuff's insane.

It's served in a cast iron pan and seasoned with rosemary, salt and some other spices (I don't really like rosemary but I LOVED this). Perfectly crispy on the outside but not too crispy, soft on the inside, just the right amount of cooked into it, and somehow it tasted savory and sweet at the same time (I'm salivating at the memory).

Although downtown Portland itself seems to be a bit unsavory, Little Bird Bistro represents the exact opposite of what's going on outside.\\n\\nThe ambiance is cute and sophisticated without being pretentious, albeit a bit dark, but we sat at the round table by the window so it didn't bother us.

We weren't expecting the portion sizes we received. Usually upscale places like this tend to skimp on the portions - this was not the case.\\n\\nI shared the kale & carrot salad with my mom, it was delicious. My only note about it is that it was hard to mix the almond butter with the rest of the ingredients because it was quite thick.\\n\\nFor my entree I got the hanger steak (if it has goat cheese on it, I can't look away). The portion is generous and pre-cut. The knife they gave me wasn't strong enough to cut through some of the fattier pieces, so luckily no one was really watching me struggle and push the sauce around a bit. The frites are crunchy and golden delicious. They're salted very lightly which gives you a lot of room to salt them more if you'd like. The goat cheese is the perfect addition to this dish and gives the steak an incredibly rich flavor and awesome mouthfeel (that's right, mouthfeel).\\n\\nI also shared the mushroom side with my sister, again a super generous portion. These are the types of mushrooms that make you thin, \\"hmm, maybe I could be a vegetarian after all.\\" But alas, I had steak waiting, so vegetarianism will have to wait.\\n\\nWe were celebrating a birthday so we ordered a few desserts -- there is always extra room in your belly for dessert.

I want to stress that this review is only for the oysters and not for anything else as I will most likely have a separate review for an entr√©e. \\n\\nThere is always a long wait, which is why I got in line 30 minutes before they open. Service was good enough.\\nNow, I ordered 2 each of the following oysters--Katama Bay, Cotuit, Chatham, Moonstone and Mookie Blue. I also ordered a Jonah Crab Claw. All of these items are from the New England area.\\n\\nPresentation is simple, but appetizing. The oysters all looked fat and fresh. My first oyster was the Katama Bay. There wasn't much, if any brine. It was a plain oyster, not much life or flavor. I had my next one with some cocktail sauce, which just masked the flavor of the oyster. The next oyster, the Cotuit had the same bland taste. It was then I noticed the color of all the oysters was grey. Now, I am not an expert on oysters, but from my experience if an oyster has a dull grey color, the taste is also dull.\\n\\nAnd this proved to be true for the remainder of the oysters. There were no standouts amongst the 5 different types I ordered. Despite my attempts to enhance the flavor with combinations of Cocktail sauce, Tobasco or the house made Mignonette sauce I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied with the flavor, or lack thereof. \\n\\nAs for the Jonah Crab Claw, I would not order it again. It was smaller than I expected and surprisingly tough to extract the meat. The meat itself was decent, but not worth the price or hassle. \\n\\nI recall from my previous visit the entr√©e was very good, but the raw food was not particularly special. Now with this second visit I am positive that there are superior places to visit in Boston for raw seafood, mainly oysters. \\n\\nI do plan to visit Neptune Oyster again to try their entrees."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Scampo, along with The Liberty, is a place for scenesters and middle aged folks thinking they are doing it big.

Hungarian 'Prosciutto' was also nice and did not feature all the salt of the Parma variety. Tandoori scallops came with raita and papadum but were no thriller. The cesar salad had a nice whole leaf presentation and was pretty good. Only the bacon flavor came through on the white clam pizza, nobody tasted clams. Entrees of duck, baby lamb al forno and salmon steak were all cooked perfectly but were pretty average for the category of restaurant Scampo is. \\n\\nIn addition, having worked in restaurants, I understand they are hectic.

The veggies were fresh and crisp, and the rolls were accompanied with a sweet chili sauce, which is my favorite compliment to spring rolls. \\n\\n-Grilled Shrimp Piccata and Smashed Taro in Curry Gravy ($13.95): The highlight of my meal! The shrimp were delicious, with a lovely flavor, and they were served with a light pesto sauce. Smashed taro is fast becoming one of my favorite foods, they do a great rendition the dish here - my only qualm is that the consistency was a bit watery - but the flavor didn't reflect it at all - it was a very full and rich taro flavor, and the curry gravy just brought it to a whole other level - it wasn't spicy at all (thankfully), there was just a slight kick. \\n\\n-Ph  beef--b√≤ ($7.50): I only tried the broth, which I found to be fairly decent. The boyfriend said overall it was okay, but he prefers when the protein is served rare in the broth, and with the pho here it seems as if the meat is fully cooked when served. \\n\\nI'm looking forward to returning and trying their other dishes, particularly a few items from their brunch items.

When a runner brought our food (luke warm -  had definitely all been sitting a while), I asked her for ketchup, and her reaction was priceless - akin to asking her for a kidney donation. Bart returned to our table about 5 mins later with a ketchup container that was 99% empty. The first squirt showered another person at our table with ketchup spray from all the air in the squeeze bottle. Now food is really cold. The crispy fries were a hit, and burger probably would have been great if it was hot (lots of restaurants put ketchup on your table as soon as they put burgers and fries down without asking). I received an email survey which I filled out, and received a nice email from Maurice the GM.  I returned today for lunch, sat at a high-top in the bar. Arrived at my seat at 12:02. Sat for about 12 mins before we were acknowledged and given menus. Iced tea arrived at 12:22, and after watching our server walk past us 3 times and not take our order, I left and went to Chili's at 12:29. Service is deplorable.

Nuff said. \\n\\nNext, sadly, I will have to say that I was not a fan of their gluten-free vegan cakes. It was my sister-in-law's birthday, so we had called in a special order for a chocolate birthday cake. The cake was supposed to be chocolate with vanilla frosting, and it was supposed to say Happy birthday + her name. \\n\\nIt was her 40th birthday, so it was kind of a big deal. \\n\\nAnyway, it was partially our fault because we didn't check when we picked up the cake, but they got the cake flavors wrong. We were given a white cake with chocolate frosting. \\n\\nWhich really isn't a big deal.\\n\\nThe big deal was that they misspelled her name. \\n\\nWhich is funny now, in retrospect. :) \\n\\nThe cake itself was okay. I haven't had many gluten-free cakes, so I have nothing to really compare it to.

The cool breeze outside calmed me down and allowed me to restrain myself to only pounce on the food. \\n\\nOh the food...\\nFirst let's talk bread - an essential in my carb-loaded book of judgement.  They didn't bring out so-called \\"rustic Italian\\" bread that is actually just stale sourdough. Oh no. The bread was exactly like the kind I remember fondly from the beaches in Cinque Terre - a dense, soft white bread that is often overlooked by Americans. They had obviously created it by hand and added olive oil and maybe some sort of dairy product to soften it up. Slightly burnt on the bottom...wow. It was perfect.  Then came the bruschette - shaved beef, mascarpone and truffle oil. It was rich and heavenly.  We both decided to get fish dishes and split them, and we systematically destroyed the seared sea scallops with spinach carbonara, and proceeded on to the fish of the week which was a crusted halibut over rhubarb compote and asparagus. Quite possibly the most perfect meal I have ever eaten. Like I said, the food buzz continued long after the wine buzz diminished.\\n\\nThe Service-\\nPerfect. Impeccable. Chris our server never let our waters dip below half way, which is quite impressive considering that we were the only outside table. He helped us select our two dishes, and paired the appetizer.

I only had a biscuit and it was really, really good. They serve it with honey butter which is a weakness of mine. My friend said the muffins- maybe carrot- were also good.\\nOur food came out promptly and the crab cakes benedict were as delicious as everyone had said. The cakes were very meaty and not bread-y at all and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The only beef I had was with the hash browns. They don't tell you on the menu that it comes with diced raw peppers and onions on top, which would have been good to know because I don't like raw peppers. But they were easily picked out and didn't ruin the potatoes.\\nThe grits were also good, if not a little too cheesy (i know, when is anything too cheesy right?) but the sharpness of the chedder really overwhelmed the grits. But that was also not a big deal because by the time I got to the grits, I was super full.\\nSo if I had never been to Murphy's before this time, I would have given them only three stars, but since I have had several great dinner experiences here, they're getting four stars.

It's my favorite restaurant in Columbus. I've celebrated a lot of important events/times at Barcelona in the years I lived in Columbus...birthdays, anniversaries, engagement, wedding rehearsal dinner, New Years, etc.  Everytime we go, we get excellent service and our waiters always are right on with their recommendations (Michael is our favorite!). I love that Scott, the owner, walks around and talks to the tables...he knows all of the regulars and provides individual attention.  I have been to some of the wine and sangria tastings Barcelona offers during the year, and they are wonderfully executed.  Plus, a coupon to enjoy dinner afterward is always nice!\\n\\nBy far my favorite dish at Barcelona is the farfalle pasta. Even though they change it occasionally, it remains my favorite dish...the bowtie noodles with pesto, pinenuts and chicken is delicious. I'm a fan of the Caesar salad as well, even if I have to use a knife to cut the lettuce into more manageable pieces.  I find it interesting that the calamari comes out in a brown paper bag...not quite what I would expect from a place like Barcelona.  The scallops are delicious as well, and I sometimes order them as my dinner even though they are listed as an appetizer.  I love the wine list at Barcelona, and especially love the special they run on Sundays, where bottles of wine are marked down.  I don't think I've ever been there where we didn't drink at least two bottles :)\\n\\nNext time I am in Columbus, Barcelona is going to be my first stop for dinner, as I have not yet found a place as homey and delicious in Phoenix."},{"name":"Solly's Bagelry","address":"368 W 7th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"So I go to a long established Jewish deli and order Hot Pastrami on Rye.

Alexander's at 4701 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30338 in Perimeter Village, the shopping center North and across Ashford Dunwoody Rd from Perimeter Mall. This is a large shopping center that has a Walmart as the anchor, but also includes a US Post Office and several restaurants worth trying like Viceroy Indian Cuisine. I spend a lot of time over here due to its proximity to my work.\\n\\nJ. Alexander's occupies the old Houston's location, inheriting the sexy interior that features fabulous Louis Poulsen Artichoke Pendant Lamps, a rich dark wood interior and inviting bar. For me this location was always about drinking and having a few appetizers, something the restaurant does very well. I had eaten here a couple of times when it was Houston's and think of that chain as more of the original bourbon/wine and steak concept. J. Alexander's continues with that theme, at least at this location (the only one I've visited) and does very well by that concept, offering a selection of steaks, seafood and wines competitive with many high-end restaurants.\\n\\nOn this occasion I attended a short business meeting during lunch with only a few people. For the most part everyone was looking at the salads and fish options so my photos and review will focus on those items. I hope to come back and try a nice cut of prime rib with a reserve label red. We had reservations and were seated with about 5 minutes of standing in the lobby waiting for the entire party to enter. Service started very good with polite hosts attending and a couple of wait staffers to serve (I believe one was in training).\\n\\nI had one of the specials, the Golden Sea Bass with Mango Papaya Salsa served with couscous and it was quite good if a little light weight - a small salad would have enhanced the experience (but again, I should have asked about a salad). I was envious of the lunch salads that others ordered, including an Ahi Tuna Salad and a Cyprus Salad from the regular menu.\\n\\nFood on delivery seemed a bit rushed and the wait time from order to delivery was quite long - the only negatives to an exceptional experience. Also and perhaps this was due to the rushed delivery, the food was a bit skewed on the plates (I know that this is nitpicking but when you pay more the expectation should be higher, yes?).

I've been here 3-4 times, and each time I have had a completely lackluster experience. On one occasion, I attended a retirement party for a coworker. The restaurant was contacted at least a week prior to the event, I believe. There were maybe 20 or so in our group- which is a large group, to be fair. We had tables reserved in a corner of the restaurant. That was nice. The not so nice part was the fact that the staff hardly checked in on us. One person in our group had to remind the server to bring them their order after everyone else had received their drinks/food. No water was refilled the entire 2 hours we were there. No one checked in to see if we wanted more drinks. When we got our bills, three of us in the group had our orders all mixed up and they had to try three times to ring us up for the appropriate amount. I understand that there were a lot of us which didn't help the fact that it was a Friday night, but you would think that since they knew such a large group was coming, they would have planned ahead and scheduled extra staff. \\n\\nOn my latest visit, the service was just as terrible. When my group and I walked in, the host did not even make eye contact, just gave us a dull \\"hello\\" while he was reading something. Again, no water was given to us.

I have gone outside of happy hour however, and would not do so again.

It would normally come with lettuce, mayo, and I think tomatoes. I loved it but it was a little too plain, my fault I ordered it that way. The sausage is really good, not too spicy but has a kick and has a snap when you bite into it. The Po Boy It came with a side. I got the Cheese Grits, so good. I like grits thick and they were.

I know some of my friends would think it should be warmer. The only downside I had in my meal was the coffee cup itself...it has the strangest thick lip on it. It was hard to drink out of.

Yes, the lobster roll -- hot and buttered --  was just right. It was generous, and had ample pieces from the tail, claws, and knuckles. It missed on the lobster meat, though. It tasted fresh, but I guarantee you it was too chewy. The flavor was very good--but either the lobster itself was just a tough little bottom dweller, or it was over-cooked. \\n\\nWhatever I say will have little impact, other than for the person who reads this, and whom is never overwhelmed by over-hype. Perhaps this was a one-time deal, where things didn't work out as advertised/promoted. Very possible.\\n\\nI heard through the grapevine that the owners are really great community people, so I definitely have no desire to drag them down. I applaud, and thank them. I enjoyed my meal very much, and would recommend this establishment.\\n\\nI did find one thing irritating...I arrived at about noon on a Saturday \\"morning\\" and knew the \\"cell-phone-number-taking-in-person\\" reservation routine.

Even though the hostess/waitress recognized me, and took my name, with no other names ahead of me--they still grabbed the two guys behind me, and seated them before me. //Seriously, I'm accustomed to this \\"stuff\\",so I don't go nuts about it...(try eating out at popular Miami restaurants) it's just mildly irritating. Trust me--it had nothing to do with the seating chart--they just preferenced a couple guys ahead of me--and it wasn't a local, with his cronies.--that \\"stuff\\" I understand.\\n\\nOn a last good note, I sat at the bar, had a terrific bartender (even though I couldn't have a beer, due to work later in the day), and fun, nice people around me.

No problem finding a seat, because it was not crowded. (Parking was h@ll though, too tiny of a parking lot for that many stores). Ordered the Tabouli salad ($6.99). He ordered the lunch special Lamb, Dirty Rice, Salad, and Drink ($7.99) I felt that the wait time before the food was served was acceptable, not short, but not overly long either. When the food arrived, the Tabouli was spread out onto a flat plate, served with a side basket of warmed pita bread. The menu listed the Tabouli being accompanied by wheat crackers, not sure why this was changed. I would have preferred the crackers although the pita bread was fresh and warm, if you like that kinda thing, just doesn't really go well with a cold salad. The Tabouli was fresh with quality tomatoes and cucumbers, however it was too heavily seasoned with salt which over powered the dish. I will not be ordering that again. He liked the Lunch Special, with no complaints about its flavor. Our server was a kind, young woman who was nice and very prompt with our drink refills.

All of them are great, especially the butternut squash and my personal favorite, the apple and honey pizza. Aside from that, they also have good fries, steak tartar, and oysters. \\n\\nThe drinks are great as well. It was the first place I saw that had Maine Beer Co's Mo, which is now one of my favorite beers. They have a pretty great beer selection overall, but haven't had any of their cocktails.\\n\\nAtmosphere is very mixed, I'm also not crazy about how everything is set up. They have small tables near the front windows, booths on one side, hightops and the bar on another, and then it breaks off into a different section where there are tables and then lots of people standing behind another bar. That space is laid out too much like a crappy club and not a cool bar/food place. That's how I feel anyways.\\n\\nService is fine except that they still make you wait in line when you have a table inside, which is pretty ridiculous. To clarify, we had a table inside with a reservation, two people showed up after we started and the line outside had already grown ridiculous, but they were forced to wait because the reservation wasn't in their name and they didn't enter with the reservation.

Below average for price based on the quality of the food and portion. Palms and Mastro have better steak and Red Lobster has better seafood. Cleanliness is below the average (check underneath your table).  The high ratings and meals in excess of $30 per person do not guarantee great service either.  Portland City Grill does not provide crumb scrapers for its waiters so expect to find better cleanliness at an average Italian restaurant.  After finishing the first course, the waiter took our plates and brought our second course without cleaning the table.  Further we were there with my brother who plays for the Trailblazers and were told they had a strict policy that no more than 4 can sit near the window to see the view.  This means that the restaurant was full of people taking pictures by the views hovering over the patrons.  Also be mindful of the host/hostess as they allowed 3 seatings of parties of 2 with no reservations at tables of 4 near the view while parties of 3 and 4 waited for over 30 minutes to be seated.

The roast beef was topped with flavorful tomatoes, delicious crispy onions, and some leafy greens all put together with fresh bread. I'm not too big on the horseradish flavor so I got the horseradish mayo on the side the second time. There seemed to be a perfect balance of all the ingredients to make the sandwich and it left me full.\\n\\nI hear great things about their baked goods and have only tried their peanut butter cookie, but I wish they were a bit cheaper. The peanut butter cookie was bursting with peanut flavor and had the right amount of crunch.

But I do not care, because the food is 100% worth it. And, the prices are great.\\n\\nThere are a few dishes I usually gravitate towards on this menu. First, the pho ga, which is the old standby for any Vietnamese joint. It's great, no complaints whatsoever. But, even better than the pho ga is the bun cha gio chay. This is thin rice noodles, cold, topped with shredded cucumber, carrot, lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, basil, and pieces of crispy fried spring rolls. It comes with a little bowl of nuoc cham to pour over the top. It is totally fantastic. The word \\"chay\\" indicates vegetarian, meaning the spring rolls specifically, but they also serve a version made with meat spring rolls. They have other varieties of bun dishes as well, which definitely merit trying. Bun is a great and under-appreciated Vietnamese food.\\n\\nMy other favorite dish is tomatoes and pineapple stir fried with tofu. This sounds bizarre but is really excellent. It's a little like a sweet and sour dish but simpler, really tasty and filling but not too heavy either. \\n\\nTwo more words: Avocado shake. This is amazing and you should get one immediately. \\n\\nDo not try to order in Vietnamese unless you speak Vietnamese.

My wife was concerned when making reservations considering some of the less than stellar reviews.  We had a N facing window table and it was a beautiful view on a very nice day.  We were promptly seated (had reservations) and started right in on the buffet.\\n\\nThere are many small serving areas for various things such as sushi in one spot (neither of us made it there before being too full to eat more), small deserts (I did make it there and the lemon bars were excellent as was the little almond whatever it was), an omelet/scrambled egg station (the crab-bacon-spinach-mushroom omelet with two of the cheese varieties was excellent, but I sure wish they had jalapenos for a touch of spice), and then a buffet row on one side of an aisle and salads,  some deserts, fruit, crab legs and shrimp, and various other things on the other side.\\n\\nMy wife did better planning and made it fairly quickly to the carving station at the end of the buffet.  She was quite pleased with the quality of the beef.  I, on the other hand, took too many other things and never did make it to the carving station (I definitely would do things differently a second visit).  They had a few filler dishes on the line I was questioning for a classy Sunday brunch, such as a big serving dish of mac & cheese (a woman at the next table took an entire plate of this so what do I know), and the next one was fish & chips (I didn't see any vinegar - blasphemy) which I did take and it was okay, but too filling for a buffet such as this.  I did not take the standard sliced potatoes which were next in line (complete filler if you ask me).\\n\\nI did not try the sausages, but the bacon was right in the middle between loose-and-floppy and stiff-as-a-board, and I liked it a lot, especially dipped in the sauce used for the crab puffs, which were tasty.  The bacon was of high quality with minimal fat, and I was thankful for that.\\n\\nThe fish (I think it was steelhead) was decent, but my wife being more the fisherman was smart enough to take a piece closer to the head and thought it was really good.  You'd think I would learn, but I keep forgetting every time.\\n\\nFrom the kitchen you can order (included in the price) waffles and eggs benedict (I had a buttermilk waffle with berries and whipped cream on top - no syrup anywhere I could see - and it was very tasty, while my wife had the eggs benedict and was very happy with it).\\n\\nA small pan of pull-apart lightly carmelized rolls is served on each table, and although we did not finish all of ours, it was not because we did not like them.  There just were other things I wanted so we each only ate two sections each.\\n\\nFor my birthday they brought out a small very rich chocolate desert with a raspberry on top.  I should have gone up and gotten more raspberries from the fruit plate because the combo was very filling, but really yummy.\\n\\nSo we enjoyed ourselves, the food was good (I was a little disappointed with three big so-so ones right in a row on the serving line, and the cinnamon rolls were very generic and not the rich and creamy ones I most enjoy), the view was really nice, and it was a very pleasant experience.  At $45 each it was a bit pricey, but not out-of-line for these sorts of things.

We had such a wonderful evening here and couldn't believe the size of the prime rib we got in our deal. If you haven't been Clyde's is like a total throwback restaurant, complete with the castle-y exterior, an actual parking lot, giant prime rib sign on the front, and an interior that reminded me of Haunted Mansion. You could say we were excited, and the food did not disappoint. \\n\\nA few things to note: \\n- It took a while to get our food. We had a great server who kept us in the loop, but if you're going in this month be prepared to spend some time and get snuggly with who you're with. :D It also helped that we lucked out and got this giant booth to ourselves right in front of a fireplace. \\n- As previous reviewers have noted in the past, they also ran out of dessert (in this case it was the cheesecake) and it was somewhat surprising as when it got to our table we suddenly had creme brulee, but that was probably even tastier than the cheesecake.\\n- We did hear someone yell \\"I'm trying the best that I can!\\" and we also had some hiccups in the beginning where our first course came twice, and noticed the same for another table around us. The food was excellent and our server was great, so we didn't mind. \\n\\nThe food - We loved it. Our prime ribs came out perfectly, and we loved the dessert!! For those looking to do Portland Dining Month I highly recommend the chocolate cobbler, it was basically a perfectly warmed brownie with ice cream on top. There was also a hint of coffee, which I loved. The creme brulee tasted like a perfect marshmallow with a creme brulee consistency, so if something like that happens to you do not be afraid! Unless you don't like marshmallows, then run away? I guess? \\n\\nAll in all -- if you're like us, and you're just looking to take advantage of a $33 dinner that includes prime rib AND dessert, and don't mind actually talking to who you're with, you will most likely have a great time as we did.

My wonderful school that I work for set up a very nice little happy hour for us at the new BJ's in Oviedo. The hospitality group paid for appetizers and then if you wanted drinks, other food, etc. then you were ordering that and paying for that part. Some got there around 3:45 and some arrived up to about 4:30. Everyone ordered drinks and more appetizers because they did have a 50% off appetizers until 6:00 and some people even ordered food to go.\\nAround 6:00 I asked my server if she could please bring me my tab and she said ok. Around 6:15, still no tab in my hand, their lovely manager proceeds to come to our table to tell us that we had went OVER our 2 hour limit and that his \\"other\\" customers were getting aggitated and they needed us to wrap it up, get our tabs and basically hit the highway! Mmmm, excuse me? What? I don't think I heard you right!! I have NEVER been asked to \\"hurry up\\" at a restaurant because we were taking too long. Then to make it even better the said manager continued to STARE us down every 30 seconds or so. Just looking to make sure we were getting the hell out I suppose! The waitress finally brought us our tab around 6:35 and then took about another 10-15 mins to run all the tabs and bring us our bills.

I will be choosing other dining establishments in the area that actually appreciate the fact that you have 25 people spending quite a bit of money at your restaurant over this place! Unbelievable! \\nMe and 2 other ladies go to the other manager on duty to tell him about our experience and he then says that they do try to have a 2 hour limit for big parties! Really, because that was never mentioned when our hospitality coordinator called to reserve 2 tables for us. Highly offended that \\"our\\" money wasn't good enough for this place!\\nSorry BJ's, but you screwed up! If you expect to have repeat customers and actually stay in business perhaps your managers need a little 101 on how to treat customers! Never again!\\nAnd, I forgot to mention that as the manager is standing there telling our 2 tables that we needed to leave, several people at my table had just received a flight of sample beers and other drinks that they had ordered!

So today the day hurricane Irma hits they decide to open and serve wow that's great news!  Lets go support a local business that is trying to serve our neighborhood on a day such as this.  They opened at 4 we arrived at 430, the owner said they were not taking phone orders we tried calling in;  there were approx 15 to 20 customers there we ordered after about a 15 minute wait time.  people were filtering in every 5 to 10 minutes or so placing orders  then the owners start arguing with each other on what orders have been placed and so forth, then they start running out of ingredients, then people start receiving their orders before me, then they ran out of pizza box's, two hours later I asked for my $$ back they obliged.  Granted it was the intent that the owners to do this by themselves I applaud them for this but they were truly not prepaid they even had a lady help them behind the bar who frequented the establishment.  They also had a prior employee help out who was there to order a pizza.  I truly hope this couple goes out of business so we get real entrepreneurs  in there who know how to run a business, there heart is in the right place but that does not mean you can run a restaurant.

James was really cool and gave us each a half roll of Connecticut and Maine so we could try both and we both ordered fries with our order that costed $1 extra.\\n\\nThe Maine includes celery, mayo, and lemon reminiscent to a chicken salad but with 5.5 oz of lobster chunks in a good way. I liked that the roll was toasted and the lobster was a cold contrast to the bun. The Connecticut was a toasted Texas style roll with warm lemon buttered lobster chunks inside. The roll was soggier with the lemon butter, however it paired well with the tougher lobster chunks and of course who isn't a fan of butter. Overall, my friend and I preferred the Connecticut because the warm and on warm combo worked better with the lobster. \\n\\nThe fries were also double fried and added to a filling meal after having a full roll.

I felt like I interrupted their break time after a long hard day when I walked in and started looking over the ice cream case and the baked goodies.  For a good 2 minutes neither one of the guys working behind the counter said hello, can I help you, want to taste?  I asked for a sample of a \\"Butter Pecan-type\\" based on the hand written tags taped on the front of the glass case.  The server said \\"Which one is that?\\"  I pointed to the one just below the tag and he said \\"I guess we are out of that one.\\"  He then takes a couple of sample spoons and starts sampling and says \\"O wait, this may be it...\\"  (HUH!?!)  \\nI asked if they had sugar free or NSA and he said they had Vegan...(smh)\\n\\nAnyway, I tasted a few and chose one of the sorbets...it was really good!

They opened at 1130AM, and we got there around 1145. The restaurant had less then 10 diners, so we were seated immediately, yes! I had read about the 3hour+ wait some people had experienced, and was trying to avoid that at all costs.\\n\\nWe ordered 6 oysters, a hot lobster roll, and the clam chowder to split. First and foremost, Neptune has the best oyster selection and menu I have seen to date. I love how they have it in a list format, with the name of the oyster, where it comes from, price, and the taste/size. It's really helpful in picking out oysters that suit your tastes! The prices are very reasonable too, all in the $2something range. I don't like large oysters, and prefer the briny taste, so we ordered 2 Tatamagouche, 2 Weskeag, and 2 Kusshi. Each one was a winner! This was a much better oyster experience than my visit to Island Creek Oyster Bar because I knew exactly what I was picking. Like all the seafood I've experienced in Boston so far, the oysters were super fresh and delicious!\\n\\nThe lobster roll was huge. Generous would be an understatement for the amount of lobster they stuffed into that roll. We got the hot variety, which came coated in butter instead of mayo. I had never heard of serving a lobster roll hot, so I wanted to try it out. It was ok, a bit chewier I think because it was hot, and super fresh of course. My bf appreciated this more than I did, but we both thought it was very good. The fries it came with were wonderfully seasoned and very crisp, just how I like it.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was a big let down though. Since it is one of the popular menu items, I expected great things from the bowl. However, it was very thin and watery, and tasted more of potatoes than clams. I was so disappointed. And I absolutely love clam chowder too! I ended up just fishing out the clam bits, and leaving the soup and potatoes. \\n\\nOverall Neptune is a great restaurant and the oyster selection alone is good enough for multiple repeat visits.

I did go here with a friend this summer though, and I thought the prices were reasonable. The Happy Hour food is cheap (Although their drinks seemed over-priced, which balanced things out). I ordered average wine, but I'm not sure if you had to order alcohol to get the happy hour. The gorgonzola Fries were amazing, and very distinctive.  Very rich, and very good. They sponsored a \\"Sex and the City\\" movie Party last year and have been promoting events in the community. They are short on staff, and seem to only have 1-3 people working the tables, but I do think it's because of the economy.

However, after working on Newbury Street all day Saturday I made my first and hopefully only visit to Match and let me tell you I was FAMISHED. If there was a separate rating for decor I would give Match 4/5, with a beautiful circular bar, mirrors on the far wall and and a REAL FIRE along the back wall all accenting the dimly lit room. Even with all the interesting sights the environment still struck me as a little fake and as expected it was the cuisine that fell hopelessly short. Match's thing is \\"Burgers & Martinis\\", unfortunately by burgers they mean $8-$10  \\"miny burgers\\" that equal 1/3 of an entree each. Sure, there are 5 or 6 creative choices like: Tuna, Lamb and Lobster, but COME ON $30 for a burger?

But I could probably be a competitive eater, so it was awesome for me.\\n\\nThe Som Tom is a papaya salad, with peanuts, fresh green beans, peanuts, and more. It came with sticky rice. This was amazing. And I love spice and spicy foods, so this was perfect for me. If you're averse to spice, maybe ask them to tone it down, because it would be good either way.\\n\\nThe Larb Moo is this weird minced pork dish with fresh cucumbers and fresh herbs and such. So good, and again, rather spicy. It also has that Thai basil flavor, which has the essence of licorice. Amazing! So, so good. Again, sticky rice was included. I doubt many people order this, because it looks and sounds sort of unfamiliar, but as long as you aren't opposed to Thai basil or cilantro, you will not be disappointed. It seemed like most people were ordering Pad Kapow instead. I'll probably try that the next go-around.\\n\\nThe line is relatively short to non-existent compared to La Barbecue, which is in the same food truck park. The wait on food is a bit longer than I would have liked (I was quoted 15 minutes and it took more like 25), because the lovely woman making the food seemed to take a lot of meticulous care preparing each dish individually. The food is totally worth the wait. It's immediately one of my favorite places in Austin. It really rocketed up to my top/elite food trailers and even restaurants overall.\\n\\nThe other knock on it might be that they were out of the pork skewers, which were still listed on their sandwich board menu outside. The proprietor seemed a little exasperated having to tell every person that he had noted this on the website but hadn't updated the board. Basically everyone was ordering the skewers and then having to call an audible at the last moment. Some seemed pretty disappointed to the point of irritated. I look forward to trying those in the future. I hope this spot really flourishes, because it is wonderful food, and if they maintain this high quality consistently over time, it will deserve a permanent place in the pantheon of top Austin food trucks.\\n\\nUPDATE (April 2018):\\n\\nI've been here many more times. They've moved. La Barbecue is elsewhere. They are now closer to Taco Flats, La Holly Bar, and down the block from Hops and Grain's beer tasting room. Lots of stuff has happened since I wrote the original review. I've eaten all the menu items other than the tofu. All are amazing. Truly. So flavorful and spicy and unique. The pork skewers (which they now seem to always have enough of) are insanely good. Everyone I've brought here loves this place. And the Thai Green Tea seems to be the favorite beverage of friends and family, although the standard Thai Tea is my personal favorite of the two (I like my tea like I like my women. Bitter, over ice, and topped with sweet condensed milk. That's a joke. Relax.). \\n\\nMy only knock now is the relative dearth of shady seating. Some sort of tent or sail-like cover or other shade panel would go a long way in making lunch more relaxing time from May through September.\\n\\nGreat spot still.

You get to try a few smaller beers instead of a big ol' pint of just one thing. Rose & Crown in the United Kingdom section of Epcot is one of the only places in Disney World you can get a flight! The Imperial beer sampler ran me $16 w/tax & tip. The only sad thing is, if you take your flight outside you can't take the mat with you. It's a laminated mat that tells the name of each beer & a small description so you can keep it straight. They don't trust us to bring it back, people!!! haha Lucky for me, I had tried all but 1 of the beers before so I pretty much knew what was what. \\n\\nWe ended up sitting outside on the sidewalk, right outside the doors of Rose & Crown which was perfection. It wasn't nearly as loud & rowdy as it was inside the pub, plus we got in some good people watching.\\n\\nIn the Imperial beer sampler, you get to try 5 beers - Bass, Harp, Strongbow (cider), Boddingtons, and Guinness. None are too strong and only Guinness has a bit of heaviness to it. If you're doing the Drinking Around the World in Epcot challenge with friends, the sampler is the perfect way to go! You can each try a sip of each beer and be on your merry way. If you're doing the challenge solo, I imagine it'd be a bit much but hey! You only live once.\\n\\nDrinking Around the World Challenge - Get the Imperial Beer Flight for $16."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great spot!\\n\\nGood food, but what's even better is the ambiance.

I had the fried chicken, egg and cheddar biscuit (I believe this was the name...it's the only thing like that on the menu) and the biscuit was huge and yummy. It's not a cheddar biscuit, rather, it has a big slice of cheddar right on the biscuit. My husband had the duck duck steak and it was rich and perfect after a night of too many cocktails the night before. My mom had the French toast and it's a MUST. Even if you order the small and just have it for the table to taste, it's worth getting. All in all we left satisfied and thought it was one of the best meals (if not the best) we had while in Portland.

For a place with a namesake of \\"biscuits\\" is it wrong that I expected a pretty spectacular biscuit...rather than something bland and pretty dry. If this is supposedly a good biscuit, I guess I'm not much of a connoisseur and I'll just stick with the good ole Pillsbury Doughboy. Only real saving grace of this sandwich was a decently fried chicken and a pretty damn good graving which helped with the dryness of the biscuit.\\n\\nThe one other positive was the sweet tea which had a great balance to it. Free refills are always welcomed as well :)\\n\\nOn a side note, while the line wasn't particularly long (there was about 8 people ahead of us), our meal of 2 sandwiches didn't come out for nearly 45 minutes....I seriously could've made the sandwich on my own faster."},{"name":"Classic Cafe","address":"1313 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I really mean to give this place 1.5 stars. I'd give this place a 3 star, but then it would throw off what 3 stars on my other business reviews mean. So this place is represented by one, and this is largely based on the food. My fiance ordered corned beef hash, which he described as being \\"straight up from a can,\\" while I ordered Aegean Eggs Benedict -- it had artichokes, mushrooms and asparagus. Everything in my omelette was grossly overcooked. I could tell my artichokes also came from a can, the kind that were soaking in water all day. The cook probably didn't drain them too well because they came out really soggy. And the skin on my asparagus was wrinkly! Maybe someone should tell them that blanching them is the way to go! Aside from that, my coffee was NOT good. It was not even tolerable. It wasn't acidic, it just felt like drinking dirt water that was flavored like coffee. I tried putting more cream into it to make it tolerable, but it didn't work. I would recommend the biblical meal of bread and water. (can't go wrong on that!)\\n\\nOn a POSITIVE note, this diner was the only diner that was open past 2PM. especially on New Year's Day (who the hell wakes up early on New Year's Day to eat brunch?). Everyone that worked there was really welcoming - the lady at the counter was really sweet. I could tell that the restaurant had a good repoire with some because of the way she was interacting with another customer -- which is why I was totally thrown off by my food!\\n\\nAnywho, this is my experience. Not the greatest food, but good service. and a TV to watch Sunday's football game. If that's all you need, then this is your place.

My thoughts:\\n\\n1. The building: it's just okay. It looks to be in need of repairs. The coolers look old, the outside of them is lookin a bit rough, and the bare menu board led me to believe they were actually closed when I walked in. The floors are very lopsided and left be feeling a bit off balance. The cash register is in a weird spot, and I wasn't sure of where to stand -- by the register itself? At the bar thats five or so feet away? Somewhere else? Its just awkward. The tables and chairs inside and out look like they were cute ten years ago, but it's starting to look dilapidated. The baseboards were dirty, and the floors look like they need some TLC. The outside looks cute and rundown in a shabby chic way. The inside looks rundown in a rundown way.\\n\\n2. The location: Great! It's just off the Beltline and very close to Krog Street Market and Studioplex.\\n\\n3. Parking: There's a very small lot out front and some street parking in the area, but the most readily available option is to pay for a spot nearby. This is a busy area, and parking is going to be a challenge most days and times.\\n\\n4. Staff: The staff were kind and friendly and about as \\"professional\\" as you'd expect young folks to be who are working in an ice cream shop. Not exceptional but no complaints. \\n\\n5. The ice cream: I had a scoop of apple crumble piescream in a cup with a sugar cone for $4.88. It was a very liberal serving. It reminded me of ice creams I've had in other countries -- not overly sweet or creamy. It felt homemade but not particular special. The consistency reminded me of making snow cream at home when I was little. The flavor was pretty good though a bit too much vanilla and a bit too little apple pie. \\n\\nOverall: I'd come back if I was in the area and in the mood for a sweet or cool treat, but I'd never make a special trip for it. I'm convinced the stellar location keeps this place open given the wide variety of other and better ice cream spots in the Atlanta area.
