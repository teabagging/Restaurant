The beers on tap were a good mix of special edition house saisons and a few of their regular offerings. Some tap pours were poured from pitchers due to overcarbonation. A few beers were for sale only at outside stations separate from the main tasting room. Overall, the prices were normal for this type of beer and samplers were available- poured into large tulips with generous foam. However, a lot of the beer tasted phenolic and off with strange house yeast tasting over a body of dry, bland, seltzer tasting fluff.

We expected some wait and had been told in advance that this approach should get a group of our size a table between 12 and 12:30, but a couple of standing and waiting drinks later starting at around 12:10 and we still had another 15 minute wait?

Not sure how many days in advance one needs for that because a couple of days wasn't good enough... It's mostly come in and wait. I can't even say first come first served because our group was skipped over at least a dozen times with twosies judging from a peek at the check in list and then squished into a tight table for four...

But there are lots of places in Northwest Portland that can say the same thing, so how come I love this place so much?\\n  The big draw for me by far is the people who work here. Here's a few reasons why:\\n\\n The employee turnover at this particular McMenamin's  is extremely low. You'll notice you are in the midst of a group of people that genuinely know, like, and above all,respect one another on more than a superficial basis.\\n\\n You won't be dosed with that singsongy automaton 'server voice' that can be found all over town (and even in the classiest restaurants.)

If you're picky, they'll help you be picky-- with the revelation of additional options and further suggestions, and that comes with no pissy attitude on the side.\\n This McMenamin's is where you go when time is NOT of the essence, but if you suddenly have a reason to get out fast, you'll get genuine effort to make it happen. \\n    I suspect a good number of people not pleased with the service they are getting are less than pleasant to serve.

The waffle is a great size, trust me. (for my first time ever having chicken and waffles this was far the best). Also, their Shrimp Po Boy which is served for lunch...im a sucker for seafood and the shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauce that came with the sandwich gave that extra flavor. Me and my boyfriend love this dish, mostly our favorite in the lunch menu. With all your meals you get to pick a size if you'd desire and i cry for their mac and cheese. I thought TGIF Friday's had the best but i was wrong. It's perfectly creamy, the macaroni is big, the toasty bread crumbs on top of the mac and cheese just adds the cherry on top. I'd recommend this. Oh, and also their cut fries.\\n\\nAnother plate I've had was their Chicken Sandwich which comes with choice of a grilled or southern fried chicken breast with bacon, lettuce, mayo and green tomato chow-chow relish. This is also in their Lunch menu. I prefer the chicken fried, and its never dripping in grease...like i said perfectly cooked, and the chow-chow relish adds a magic touch to it. \\n\\nI wouldn't listen to the other negative reviews, I've ate enough here to know the staff and the food.

Most of us had never been there but heard good things from my sister. My parents and another sister traveled from out of town to celebrate. We had reservations for 8. Our server was James, and unfortunately because of his service, none of us will be going back. I was a few minutes late, and when I sat down, my family said they were pretty sure our waiter was drunk. I have worked in the service industry for 8 years now in various fine dining restaurants, as well as bars. It was obvious he was either drunk or on something...within 2 minutes of sitting, I heard him say the word \\"shit\\" to our table. Oh, but that wasn't the only time...he repeatedly used profanity throughout our dinner. At one point I overheard him say \\"I am so done with this shit\\" and then offer my stepdad another glass of wine. I was so pissed. After telling him I was looking to order a glass of red wine, he tried to convince me to order \\"a whiskey\\", saying \\"if you drink it now, you'll feel it later\\".  I had already told him no, thank you. I was soo turned off and irritated, and I wasn't the only one. He brought my brother the wrong entree, and when he took it away said \\"we'll figure something out\\" and offered him a salad....after he had just finished a salad. He ended up bringing him a beer and a shot of whiskey instead (surprise). I feel that as a server, you \\"read\\" your tables, and we were obviously not the cussing/shot-taking table. In addition, my mom and I did not appreciate the excessive shoulder and arm touching. Especially since she just recently had shoulder surgery and was in a brace. We all received our entrees, yet we never got new silverware after our apps/salads were cleared with our silverware...Some of us had to wait to start eating because we had to pull someone aside and ask for silverware for our table. At the end of the meal, my mom asked to speak to the manager on duty. A woman clearing our table said she could speak to us. We told her about our experience so far and she seemed surprised. After that, James never came back to our table, which was preferred, and we were ready to go. The woman surprised my sister with a dessert, which was very nice of her, and we all took a bite.

The main feature of their restaurant model is the \\"create your own salad\\" activity similar to building a sandwich at Subway, a burrito at Chipotle, or a pizza at Pieology. \\n\\nI went for one of the already defined items on the menu, the southern fried chicken salad. It included romaine and iceberg lettuce, roasted corn, apple, sweet and spicy roasted pecans, pickled red onion, and of course chopped fried chicken. I decided to add in some roasted brussel sprouts for a little extra veggie. I really like that they have so many options, including things you can't find at most places like chicken crackling, and various roasted veggies and toasted nuts. \\n\\nI also like that they ask you how finely chopped you want your salad and then chop all of the ingredients together. I hate it when you order a salad and have to cut whole leafs of romaine and full pieces of chicken before you can start eating. They also ask you how much dressing you'd like so you can go light or heavy depending on your taste.\\n\\nThe staff person making the salad admitted she put more on dressing than she intended and offered to add more greens if I wanted. It was already a lot of food so I opted to eat it as is. The salad was quite good and all of the ingredients well cooked/prepared. It was a lot of food and I wasn't sure I would be able to finish in one sitting. Being pretty hungry I did end up eating every bite before leaving and felt only a little stuffed afterwards. That being said, I would prefer they knock a few bucks off the $13 price tag and give me about 3/4 the amount of food.

Scallops are one of my favorite dishes to order when I'm eating out but I've never had them raw.  These were creamy and nutty and got better with each bite.  The meatballs were so tasty with a savory sauce on the side.  And the pork cheeks are served with slices of toasted bread that you can slather with a strong mustard (think Colman's) or fig spread and top it with the pork which all work together to create a comforting, crave-worthy dish.\\n\\nI wish I could remember all of the details about my dessert, especially because it was pretty incredible.  (How sad is it that I can't remember?  I'm getting old.)  They need to have a separate dessert menu with better descriptions because all that's on the menu is basically the name of the dessert or a few words and it does not do justice to these fantastic creations.

Hmmm... nothing really except THIS IS MY #1 FAVORITE ICE CREAMERY! I live in LA, CA and nothing compares to Salt N Straw. Not even Scoops in the Westside, Diddy Reise in Westwood, Blue Bird in Seattle, Handels in Redondo Beach and Ohio, or even Graters in Ohio. I get around in the ice cream circuit, and Salt N Straw is by far the creamiest, most delicious ice cream BY FAR! Every time we visit Portland I HAVE to go EVERYDAY. ADDICTED! My favorite is the Foie Gras ice cream produced September 2012 in collaboration with a local Portland butcher for 2012 Portland Feast. Since then I have not seen it come back and this breaks my heart. It's like breaking up with a long time friend. My usual go tos are: Salted Caramel, and strawberry balsamic vinegar with black pepper and olive oil mix. The seasonal flavors are always delicious with the fresh produce of the season. So please enlighten your taste buds with Salt N Straw, and enjoy. If you are lucky to be a local, I am utterly jealous in every way. Please Salt N Straw, start one in LA or someone please overnight me some gallons of ice cream to hold me over until my next Portland visit."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great place to stop in and eat wasn't super busy great simple menu the Argentine steak is great smaller portion but super good coupled with other menu items.

We got the sweet BBQ sauce and didn't love it (there is a clove taste in it, not our thing) so we'd try one of the other four sauce options next time. The ribs had a lot of meat on them and it all fell right off the bone. The spices used on the ribs and chicken were delicious!\\n\\nThe sides were really good too. We had the fries, slaw, grilled veggies and fried plantains (two sides come with a meal). The fries were crisp and had a great seasoned coating. The slaw was fresh, yummy and unique. The grilled veggies were the most delicious grilled zucchini and squash. I honestly could have eaten an entire plate of them. And the fried plantains were AMAZEBALLS!

I ask her to check again and she tells me that they don't make the sauce here so she doesn't have a complete list of ingredients.

I now know that I can't trust the wings so I start looking at other items on the menu. Unfortunately about 80% of the things on their menu have their hot sauce. Even the burgers and  salads. So I order the mac and cheese and a small side salad. My food comes and it's an encredibly small portion. The the cheese melted on top is hard as a rock. The small amount of noodles under neith were tough like they were only partially cooked and then left out. The sauce on the noodles tasted like warm ranch dressing (not cheesy at all). And then the chicken on top was overly breaded and extreme dry. I was having a hard time even chewing them. My salad was fine but was small for paying nearly $3 extra for it. My husband ordered the wings combo that comes with 12 wings fries and coleslaw. The combo costs $20 and comes with maybe 15 shoestring fries and the coleslaw comes in a container the size of your dipping sauces do. It's a complete rip off! $20 and my husband was still hungry! Another person at out table ordered the artichoke dip and the dip came out cold and the chips were still doughy inside. All together a terrible experience.

We received some warm bread and oil dip but I thought our starters would accompany, oysters were the last to arrive after we had eaten our starters. Then there was another long wait until our dinners came out and again, one at a time. We had to wait like 20mins for another dish to be redone but don't understand why it took so long for all to come out together. Maybe they are still ironing out their kinks or were short staffed that night. \\n\\nThe food was delicious but I am not sure how soon I would return having to wait as long as we did for everything."},{"name":"SanSai Japanese Grill","address":"539 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The prices here are super cheap but you really are getting what you payed for.

But I have to agree with other reviewers about their slow seating process and rude hostesses. Wait staff are usually lovely! Food is usually OK, too. But the grumpy, glum faces you see from the (usually) two hostesses are just not worth it. On weekends the wait can be incredibly long and they seem to have no ability to manage a list of waiting patrons. They agonize over every table like it's tax code. It's a diner! Turn those tables fast! Instead it takes them 5-10 minutes from the time people leave until they clear and re-seat the table.\\n\\nAlso: beware the infamous, \\"NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR BEVERAGE ALLOWED\\" sign. They mean it. Their coffee is awful (just look at every other review here) so I brought an iced coffee in - note I do this regularly when I visit but I still buy their coffee because I feel guilty. First, no one greeted me at the front: they just stared down at their endless seating list and complained about the customers when there was only one other person waiting. Then I asked to be seated. I was gruffly told, 'sure but we'll have to take that (pointing at my coffee). We'll keep it up here until you leave.' Seriously? Like my 2$ coffee is going to negate the likely 15$ I'll spend on your breakfast food? And you can't be nice about it and say, \\"I'm sorry, but would you mind leaving that with us or drinking it before you sit? We have a strict no outside food and beverage policy.\\" I completely understand the policy. I used to be a chef owner of my own place. But enforce it with some tact and intelligence.

I appreciate their lower prices!  I can afford to eat here frequently (which happens because there are days I really don't like cooking) without hurting my budget.  But even with their prices, they server fresh and delicious food.  The avocados are perfectly ripe (no brown mush that you see at other restaurants) and the big salad in their $6.95 seafood salad has such fresh lettuce (no soggy greens and obviously higher quality than standard spring mix!).  The tempura batter is light and crispy, the scallop roll is very fresh (no yucky fishy taste), the salmon is fresh and slightly sweet, and the grilled squid is tender (again fresh and no fishy taste).  \\n\\nMy family and I usually get the tofu bento box ($7.95 as of this review and sooo good), avocado rolls, salmon avocado roll and seafood salad.  Their bentos, combos and sushi specials are such great value!  Their rolls do have more rice than other sushi places and come in larger portions (for example, the avocado rolls comes in 8 pieces instead of 6).  But I think their rice is decent.  It's a great place to have a casual meal and not break the bank.  Plus the restaurant has such a nice ambiance, is comfortable and super clean!

Sometimes I go, and everything's terrific--the drinks are quality, the food is delicious, the service is tops, and I have a hell of a good time. Yet other times, the food is mediocre, the service is crummy, and the drinks are weak. I've had several completely opposite experiences. In a nutshell: when they're on, they're _on_. When they aren't, it isn't worth the price.\\n\\nMy most recent trip was one of the good ones--I ordered the skirt steak and swordfish tacos (which are two that I regularly order), and they were both terrific. The skirt steak was wonderfully cooked and marinated, and the cojita cheese was a great complement to it. The swordfish was delicately fried enough that it tasted like fish instead of batter and sauce, and the slaw on top was a nice counter to the sweet butteryness of the rest of the ingredients. My Rosalinda margaritas were terrific, and while the one I was brought at the table was WAY less potent than the one I ordered at the bar, I was generally pleased. The guacamole was terrific, with lots of onion and garlic, and while I hate their chips (which are too heavy for my tastes), I managed to enjoy some of the guac. Our server was incredibly helpful, despite the fact that we arrived as two, and unexpectedly grew to seven, all arriving at different times and wanting separate checks. Overall, a terrific night!\\n\\nIt was a weird contrast from the LAST time I went. That time, we were seated at very small table next to an obnoxious child, despite plenty of larger ones available sans toddlers. I ordered the shrimp taco and the swordfish taco, and both were lame. The shrimp one was essentially inedible--the shrimp tasted fishy and rubbery, and not fresh at all. The swordfish was over-fried and so drenched in the sauce (which is admittedly tasty), that it was just a fatty, gloppy mess. The flour shells were dry and not pliant enough to fold like a taco. My paloma was watery and poorly made, and not worth the $8 I paid for it. \\n\\nI go here fairly regularly, and I've had several other menu items, but, similarly, have had wildly varying experiences. The corn on the cob with the mayonaissey dressing and cheese is great--except when its got too much of the dressing on it. The roasted beef tongue was great the first time I had it--juicy and flavorful and nicely complemented by the cilantro, but the NEXT time I had it, it was dry and came with way too much cilantro. The young goat isn't offered often, but when I've tried it, it's been way too greasy. I could go on, but just about everything fits this same theme--sometimes great, sometimes totally meh. \\n\\nDespite its inconsistencies, I continue to return to Holy Taco fairly regularly, so there's only so much I can complain. :D  The porch is one of my favorites in Atlanta, and--when they're made well--so are their margaritas. If they could only be consistently good, I'd be thrilled. If every experience matched my BEST experiences at Holy Taco, I'd call it at least a 4.5 star spot."},{"name":"Central Bistro","address":"34 Summer St, Fl 2","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The first time I went for lunch with coworkers.

The \\"creamy\\" lobster bisque was noty creamy at all. And the only lobster in it was one small lobster claw, in tact. I found that odd. Once I ate the tiny lobster claw (small enough for one bite), I was left with a broth that resembled tomato juice. It was not tasty, not filling, and not creamy. And that was $10.

We all got ready and left to Buffalo Wild Wings . We were greeted nicely and had a party of 8 so a long wait for the table was expected but we surprisingly had a short wait. Everything was going great until our waitress came to introduce herself. She sounded irritated and not wanting to be at work whatsoever, she then asked for our drinks and we politely asked for them. When she brought our drinks we realized they had no ice so again, I politely asked if I could get a cup with just ice . (I thought it would be easier to just get a cup and share the ice instead of having her bring us all new drinks WITH ICE) She said yes with a mean face and her eyes just rolled. (I ignored that) As she walks back to our table with the cup of ice she gets to our table and slams the cup of ice on our table. At this point my aunt gets irritated because of her constant attitude so she hands over the cup and comments about her attitude. (Btw the cup was only half way filled with ice) So I asked for some more Ice. (Keep in mind it was 8 drinks with no ice, so obviously a half a cup with ice was not enough ) As she walks back to the table with a full cup of ice she approaches me slowly and carefully places the cup on the table right next to me and then she asks \\"was that gentle enough for you now?\\" Obviously at this point I was super upset and was not able to enjoy dinner at all. I ask to speak to the manager and thankfully the manager was nice enough to understand the situation and talk to her about it. Although I doubt it helped because this waitress (Lily to be exact) continued giving us that mean look and would murmur things under her breath every chance she had. It was so bad that another one of her co workers came to apologize for HER bad service."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazinggggg brisket!!

We were the only two patrons in the restaurant, yet it still took 30+ minutes to get our food. I'd be weary coming if your'e in a rush or on a lunch break, especially at a busier time. The pad thai was good--the beef was cooked properly and well seasoned. It was not a traditional pad thai, but tasty nonetheless. It's also advertised as spicy, but it had very minimal spice. I wasn't very impressed with the xiao long bao, they tasted mostly of dough. They are a lot smaller than I'm used to--it's not a portion issue, because they give you plenty of little dumplings, but I appreciate the larger xiao long bao so you can really appreciate the soup. The dumplings came with a dipping sauce which was unusual and taste of watery strawberries.

And I'll drive great distances to get a good one in metro Atlanta.\\n\\nHowever, I no longer have the need to drive far at all to get the best biscuit in metro Atlanta, because it's found at Ponce City Market's newest food stand, Hop's Chicken, by chef Linton Hopkin's.  The menu is limited, but what they have, they do well.  The chicken biscuit is the most notable standout, with  yellow, buttery biscuit that is incredibly flaky - more like a pastry- and stuffed with a moist and lightly breaded flattened chicken tender.  Big breakfast eaters might like too, but one is enough for a typical appetite, particularly when accompanied by one of their house-made sides.  Succotash was a cold salad of lima beans, corn, and roasted zucchini in an herby vinaigrette with red onions.  Light and vinegary, it was the perfect complement to the decadent chicken biscuit.  However, if you want to really splurge, you must get their mac and cheese.  It is probably my new favorite version.  It reminds me, as my dining companion said, of Stouffer's frozen, but in the best possible way.  Ultra creamy, rich, loose sauce around elbow noodles, and then lightly baked and topped with more cheese.  yum.\\n\\nBest of all, prices for all this goodness are quite reasonable.

I love that they give the local kids jobs but they need to instill some professionalism in them.\\n2 - They only have one label of wine and unless you are huge grapefruit fan you probably won't like the taste of any variety.  Get some decent wines!\\n3 - The beer selection is the Florida beer list circa 1992 (Corona, Corona Light, Bud, Bud Light, you get the point).  Break out and get an IPA, Hefeweizen, and a Stout or Porter.  They go with the food well.  At least a Belgian beer.\\n4 - Due to the minimalist nature of the interior any sound is reflected.

I thought the salt-sweet balance with (1) was spot on and (3) Had just enough of each part in terms of flavour to have a nice, warm-fuzzy-feeling-inside affect. (2) was a bit strong on the coffee and weak on the bourbon, and (4) could have used more balance.

Now that I've spent a lot of time in Connecticut and Boston, satisfying my craving for Italian food in Austin has been unsuccessful and always leaves me with a pang that I can't fill. . . . till now.  Imagine an Italian eatery that doesn't overcook it's pasta.  In Austin, this is a novelty.\\n\\nThe restaurant decor is clean, simple, but there are small details that \\nmake the ambiance enjoyable.  The food is the same way.  I ordered the rigatoni with fennel sausage expecting to receive a giant bowl of heavy fare, but what was brought to me was a surprisingly well portioned, uncluttered bowl.  The pasta was really really well cooked, the sauce was light but the flavor hearty with garlic and pecorino, and the dish wasn't oily from the sausage.  This, by the way, was split by 2 people.  We also indulged in some dessert (macaroons) and coffee.  By the time we left, 2 hours had passed.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked this place.  Great ambiance, great place to share a meal/coffee/wine, very friendly staff, and fantastic menu.

The waitress told me that she would gladly bring me another soda, but that she would have to charge me again. She offered to bring me a glass of water which to my surprise was 90% water and 10% ice (opposite of the soda). We brought this up to Chuck the owner as we were settling the bill. His explanation was that the soda comes out of the machine warm, so they add more ice to cool it down (???).  And that we could've had more soda if we asked for it, which contradicts what the server told us (???)...in other words he basically gave us the big blow off! \\nWhile the food isn't bad, it also isn't that great; the service is slow and the attitude is basically meh.

He discussed my individual points and personally invited me back to the restaurant.  He also took the concerns seriously.  In my book, a positive response to said original mediocre customer service is better than exceptional service to begin with.  So kudos to the Picnic House, and perhaps instead of doing anything negative to the server (he evidently is very new), this can be used as a learning experience.  Cheers!\\n\\nPS.  And next time I'm in Portland, I WILL be back!\\n\\n**Original Review***\\n\\n\\nWhat a very odd experience.  I really, really wanted to like this place.  After two very small snafus upon arriving (sign said to seat myself so when I did I got scolded and told that the host would seat me, and then there was a good deal of lipstick on my water glass once seated), I was still excited.\\n\\nI ordered half of a salad and half a turkey sandwich.  Food was fine; not extraordinary, but not bad.  Food is the reason for not giving this place one star (along with a funky ambiance).\\n\\nEverything went downhill from here:\\n\\n-Was excited to order one of their 'fun, exciting' colas and upon asking I was told they add flavored syrup to my Diet Coke.  Ok, so not fun and exciting but sure I'll take one.  Received my DC with no syrup (sorry, we're out), yet still got charged for that 'fun, exciting' cola.\\n\\n-Server was aloof and odd.  It seemed as though everything I asked or said was entirely foreign to him.  When my meal was finished, the server immediately brought my check.  I said \\"Oh, sorry, I was thinking of ordering dessert and a coffee.\\"  He looked at me quizzically and said, \\"Oh, um, well, ok.\\"  I said \\"I'll have a warm cookie and a decaf coffee with milk and sugar.\\"  He disappeared.  Upon return, he brought me a black coffee so again I asked for milk and sugar.  Puzzled, he walked away.  He returned with a hard, cold cookie in a bag (no plate?) and I said, \\"Oh you don't warm this?\\"  Again, puzzled, \\"No, I am not sure what you're talking about.\\"  (On my way out I reread the menu to make sure I wasn't going nuts.  Sure enough, warm chocolate chip cookie appears on the menu.)  Again, (a third time), I reminded him of milk and sugar.  Coffee now cold, he returns with milk and sugar.  I should add that the restaurant was not crowded.\\n\\n-Cookie from above appeared in a brown paper bag.  I know I mentioned that above, but I really feel it needs mentioning again.  Coffee in a nice mug at an in-service, sti-down restaurant and dessert in a bag.\\n\\n-Lots of folks were coming in as I sat there looking at the seat yourself sign and (gasp) began seating themselves.  One lady even pointed out the sign to the host who explained to her that he would seat her.  That's fine, but take the sign down!\\n\\n-Another reviewer said that this place was experiencing the pains of being new.  I hope that's all this was, but I am afraid it wasn't.  All in all, I won't be back when I return to Portland next."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is the place I go when I want the best food in town and when I want to impress visitors from NY, SF and LA.

Now, I've been here once before for dinner and it was so-so, but yesterday was a bit of a disaster.\\n\\nThese reservations were made a couple of weeks in advance, and one member of our team had Petit Robert put together a nice prix fixe menu for us.  There were two appetizers (lobster bisque and a garden salad), three entrees (penne pasta with mushrooms, a roasted half chicken, and a ham and brie sandwich), and two desserts (chocolate mousse and sorbet).  I had the salad, the pasta, and the sorbet.\\n\\nFirstly, the service was terrible.  It took almost fifteen minutes for our group's waiter to come pour our wine and take drink orders for those having something else.  I feel bad for the two guys who ordered beers--it took about 20 minutes for them to receive their drinks.  After the beers finally came, everyone ordered their food. \\n\\nThen we waited. And waited. And waited.\\n\\nFinally the appetizers showed up.  My salad was really good--generous portion, and the salad dressing was yummy, but not overpowering.  My co-workers who ordered the bisque seemed to really like it as well.\\n\\nThe Entrees took forever to come out after that.  Also, our waiter brought them out in waves and just left them sitting by our table while he went to go get everyone else's food.  By the time everyone was handed their entrees, the food was cold.  My pasta was all right, kind plain, but I heard complaints that the chicken was undercooked (you could see that it was very pink inside).  One women sent her pasta back because it was ice-cold.  The ham sandwich was just stupid.  Yes, the description stated that it was ham and brie...but that's literally all it was.  Cold ham.  Cold brie.  No sauce.  Not toasted.  Nothing.  Why would you bother to order something like that in a restaurant?\\n\\nThe dessert was just okay.  My sorbet was way too sweet and the little cookie thing that came with it was mushy.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I had hoped that my first experience here was a fluke, but after yesterday's three-hour ordeal I can see that Petit Robert is nothing to write home about.  Service was bad, food was bland, and for the price you can get much better fare in the area.  Try Kingston Station for a really well-done meal and excellent service in the DTX region.

Food is expensive, but I figured, if its good, its worth it.  I was happy to hear that the kids buffet is half price (thank goodness).  First, we were seated in the shadeless room at sunset and we asked to move -- no problem.  We ordered a whole bunch of stuff -- 2 rolls, 2 pc. of salmon sashimi, 3 miso soups, 6 pcs. shrimp tempura, 2 edamame, a mai tai and 5 waters for everyone.  We didn't get our drinks until about 30 minutes later, and never got our soups.  The coconut shrimp tempura was cold, but my kids ate it regardless.  My sashimi was terrific and the Bruins and Woburn rolls my hubby got were great as well.  When the waiter finally came back to check on us quite a while later, we were all finished and still waiting for our soups.  We ordered more food (I ordered 6 more pieces of sashimi and a Philly roll without sesame seeds due to an allergy), and one more mai tai.  Our water glasses were NOT refilled.  Soup finally came and it was lukewarm.  Another half hour later, my sashimi came and now it was 3 of the same size as the one I ordered before, but all cut in 2, equaling 6 pieces.  Oooookay.  My Philly roll came smothered in sesame seeds.  I had to send it back of course and my daughter never got the roll what she had ordered.  Our glasses were finally refilled... with WARM iceless water.  I noticed the table behind us having similar problems repeatedly (not getting what they'd ordered, and the one to my right also sent back their shrimp tempura for being cold.  Did I mentioned that my husband's mai tai never arrived either?  So, we've now been at this place for THREE hours, haven't gotten half of what we ordered and the 5 of us are all so ready to go.  The waiter comes back and we tell him we're all set and want the check.  \\"No dessert?\\"  No, we're all set.  He then decided to re-ask my children if they wanted ice cream.  He smiled at me and said \\"its okay, really\\" -- not in a way to intentionally go over my head, but in a way that was meant to say \\"its no problem.\\"  Regardless, it was inappropriate.  I told him no again, saying we needed to leave.  Our waiter left then to get our check and returned a couple of minutes later with the check... charging us for the mai tai we never got.  We asked the waiter to correct the bill and when he came back, he also brought  my now corrected Philly roll.  I kind of snorted and said I wasn't eating it now.  We paid (too much) and left.  Overall, I wouldn't say that the food was a total disappointment.  What we got was okay to terrific, depending on the item.  The service however DESTROYED this restaurant for us.

Mechanics of food operation failure.\\n\\nLet me say that I had high hopes for this place considering it was inside the frou-frou Ponce City Market and because there was a line with 30 people in it waiting for fried chicken.\\n\\nAfter 30 minutes in line a Hop's worker makes her way down the line to announce that they are sold out of Chicken Biscuits. I begin to question the choice of selecting this line over the Korean BBQ line. This guy turns around and reassures me, bless his heart, that this place is worth the wait and that he had just ate here days ago.\\n\\nAnother 10 minutes go by and I'm at the front of the line. The couple in front of me gets the news that Hop's is sold out of Chicken Biscuits, Chicken Sandwiches, Wings, and Thighs. A male Hop's employee shouts out, \\"I hope everyone is hungry.\\" Bish, for what?! \\n\\nI order half a bird for 9 dollars, but because they were out of wings, they gave me a breast and three drumsticks. Sure, whatever. In 10 minutes you went from selling out of Chicken Biscuits to half the menu. Ok, yeah, whatever.\\n\\nIn defense of Hop's Chicken, their sweet tea was on fleek! I would take a pass at the chicken and Mac and Cheese however. Mac and Cheese was lacking a cheesy taste. Guy in front of me has obviously no tastebuds or has never had fried chicken. I'm not sure what it is. The crew forgot to include my rolls so I had to go back up to the window and ask for them. The system of organization and processing is inadequate, but they are a startup company so I will give them time to adapt to high capacity and high demand scenarios. Where are the orders being recorded? Where are the computer systems? Why is sweet tea being poured out of a gallon carafe? Why is the kitchen running out of food so quickly and why is the proverbial ship sinking fast?\\n\\nTry Champy's Chicken in Chattanooga for better chicken and unique food selections. (See my review).

I knew the prices were high, but was fine paying top price for a quality meal. \\n\\nThe charcuterie board was good - the only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. \\n\\nWe both ordered the steak special. A large NY strip, My husband's was a good cut, and cooked fine, a little bland, but good. My cut was awful, so much fat, I literally could not cut through parts of it, by the time I had taken a few bites, it looked like a dog had gotten to it. \\n\\nOur server saw that I had not eaten much of it and asked if it was ok, when I told her the problem, after a few more questions she decided to let the manager know. The manager then asked if I wanted a new steak, not wanting to waste food, and citing that, I said no. I would just eat the sides. However, being that this was a $60 steak that was a bad cut of meat, I did expect to receive something to make up for it. So I was shocked when we got the bill and my steak was still on there, full price. \\n\\nI am not one to make a scene, and I didn't, but after working in the restaurant industry myself, when someone clearly isn't satisfied with something, especially a high priced item, you remove it, or offer something to make up for it.

He's helpful, friendly, and professional. This restaurant reflects him completely. Truth be told, we have never had a meal that wasn't delicious. I love all of the spicy offerings and my husband likes the less spicy. His favs are the chicken lettuce wraps, dumplings, cashew chicken, and chow fun. I love the chicken red curry, Mala string bean, Pad Thai and the veggie spring rolls. There's more to mention, but these are our favs. The bar is clean and comfortable and Ty can mix a delicious martini. I typically carry out and enjoy a cocktail while i wait...But if you prefer to eat in - you won't be disappointed. It is a very nice experience.

The menu is quite small compared to Star Pro's other restaurants, about 10 items total (including appetizers and desserts).  The place is pretty small, seats maybe 20-25.  The decor has a nice homey feel to it.  Also, the wait staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  \\n\\nWe had the cheese souffle, the oysters rockefeller, the lobster bisque, the roast whole chicken, a vegetable plate, and the aged bone in rib-eye.  The cheese souffle was excellent.  Light, fluffy, and bursting with flavor.  We were also impressed by the lobster bisque.  It had a deep lobster flavor, nice big chunks of lobster, and didn't rely on cream for richness.  Unfortunately, everything else was not that great.  \\n\\nFirst, the oysters rockefeller were not traditionally prepared.  I have eaten oysters quite a few times before, both raw and cooked.  I have never seen a preparation like this.  Instead of broiling them, the oysters are left raw but served warm.  This was not disclosed on the menu or by our server.  Additionally, these were the most intense oysters I have ever had.  They were super creamy but extreme briny.  It was over powering.  None of us could eat more than one.  The flavor stuck in my mouth for the entire rest of the meal.  Nothing is capable of cleansing your pallet after putting that in your mouth.  I feel like I can still taste them now.  It was such a negative experience, I can't see myself ever eating oysters again.  Just too afraid of getting one that strong.  \\n\\nSecond, when I made the reservation I asked if they could accommodate a vegetarian.  I was assured that they could.  The upstairs restaurant is capable of tailoring an entire tasting menu around various dietary restrictions, so I did not think bringing a vegetarian would be a problem if I provided advanced notice.  They had zero vegetarian entrees.  All they were able to do was prepare a vegetable plate with side items.  It was a real let down considering I gave them two weeks notice.  I was expecting at least one decent vegetarian entree.\\n\\nThird, the chicken, which is their specialty, was both underwhelming and highly disturbing.  Before coming, I read the Atlanta Magazine article about their famous roast chicken.  I have included a picture from that article.  We were not served that dish.  Our chicken arrived in a hacked up manner with the head and feet still attached.  Pic included.  I don't know why on earth they would advertise it one way and serve in such a radically different manner.  The flavor and texture of the chicken was just meh.  This was much worse than the whole roast chicken experience at Woodfire Grill.  In truth, the roast chicken at Eats and Roasters is much better.  Here, the skin was mushy, the meat was under seasoned, and it was not even carved well.  Such a disappointment.\\n\\nFinally, the aged steak was just ok.  Putting aged steak on the menu with so many great steakhouses in Atlanta is a bit of gamble in my opinion.  This was just not as good as anything you can get at Hal's, Bones, Chops, McKendricks, or even STK.  I would say the steak was about as good as what you typically get at King & Duke or Capital Grill.  I was expecting something more impressive.  \\n\\nOverall, I just don't see any reason to come back here.  Shame."},{"name":"Taco Bella's","address":"3008 W Slaughter Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Good quality Mexican food!

This local chain make their own beer and have their own bar food grub. But what makes them different from your other bar places? They purchase and preserve buildings, which have a lot of history and re-establish it into their own. Pretty much they bring the past and blend it into today's future.\\n\\nSome McMenamin's have a movie theater or even a hotel. Each location is quite different.  This McMenamin's (Tavern & Pool) venue is located towards the end of the Alphabet district. Not to be mistaken by another McMenamin's (The Ram's Head) on the opposite side of NW 23rd Avenue. What's cool about this place is that they have a couple pool tables next to the bar. \\n\\nBut with all the McMenamin's they serve the same ol' food and drank.\\n\\nTHE RUBY: is my usual order at a McMenamin's establishment.

It came with a chipotle aioli sauce, but I preferred dipping the fries in good ol' fashioned ketchup. The Stormin' Norman is a BLT sammy was a bit greasy. I split this dish with a friend.

It's roasted to perfection. It's the best duck I've ever tasted in my life, and I've been around. Authentic HK style roasted duck. \\nYou don't go to the restaurant for service or decor. You go there to eat. It's a foodie heaven. I ordered different items off the menu other than the duck, but nothing as memorable as the duck. Oh, the waitress wasn't that friendly. However, this is the way I look at things: with the amount of work that's laboured over one duck, it is actually more work and difficult than the infamous french dish Duck Confit. However, the French charges at least $35 for a leg, while No. 9 only charges $12 for a larger portion. The decor and the waitress' attitude aren't edible. So, as long as they deliver the food piping hot and fast, No. 9 is a bargain.\\nCash Only people.

Ppl that go here are prob first timers like us. Once and never again ! \\n\\nThis place doesn't even deserve 1 star.  From the very start we should have left. Got awful customer service when we first walked in.  7pm on a nice night on a Saturday any good Restuarant should be packed.....this place had prob 4-5 tables sitting.  That should have been a sign right there.  But we decided to give it a shot.  Our waiter didn't even speak good English and barely asked how we were as he dumped our glasses full of water.  \\n\\nThen another guy puts down stale sliced bread.  I asked for butter from my waiter and he rolled his eyes at me.  Then I asked for lemons and its was pretty much the same face. Then our waiter comes back and finally asks if we want something else to drink. \\n\\nFinally we order some calamari appetizer.  It was edible but nothing special. Just right out of a freezer bag. Prob the worst I've had.  He ended up taking half of it away because we couldn't even eat the bigger rubbery pieces.  We were obviously still hungry, but couldn't finish our appetizer....that doesn't make sense, right ?  \\n\\nWe then ordered dinner.  Our waiter asked if we wanted both our meals with a side salad or pasta.  We figured it would come with pasta but I guess you pick.  So we both said we would like our meals over the pasta.  Mine was chicken with lemon capers mushroom and artichokes. (I forget the name) seemed like it would be yummy : /.  My fianc√© got chicken marsala.  In the meantime, still hungry... I asked for bread that wasn't stale.  We actually got some fresh bread which wasn't too bad.\\n\\nSo then our meal comes out and mines over pasta as I asked but my fianc√© is chicken marsala on the plate and then a side of pasta with sauce.  (Weird.....I thought we made it clear we wanted it both over pasta). He said that is was a communication error.  Oh why? Because he doesn't even speak great English or you just suck as a waiter. Or both !  So that was a waiter fuck up.  I use to waitress, so I get it, mistakes happen....so he didn't send it back we just dealt with it.  \\n\\nNow we start our meals. The chicken looks kinda un-trimmed and funky. I eat a piece and it was quite nasty.  So I started eating the over cooked pasta drenched in this \\"lemon wine butter\\" sauce.  It tasted like it was cooked in a dirty pan.  I'm not even kidding !  My fianc√© was gross too.  I didn't try it because he warned me not too. It didn't look great and his side pasta barely had any sauce on it, and again over cooked.  \\n\\nSo our waiter clearly can tell we aren't enjoying our selves or are meals. Also during our entire meal, he stood literally 5 feet hawking over our table. So he had 2 other tables at most that obviously didn't need any help either.  Maybe he should have looked and poured me more water while he was watching us. That would have possibly been helpful. But he knows I'm frustrated and not happy.  So as we continue to push around the food on our plates and debate whether we should ask for a manager or cut our losses.....our waiter comes over and says \\"it doesn't appear your enjoying your meals\\".  As I reply \\"no, not at all. We just want to leave\\".   He then started picking up our plates and insisted that we not pay !!!!!  WHAT ? So instead of apologizing or even having a manager come over he insisted we just not pay if we weren't happy.    We insisted to pay for the appetizer (which was gross anyways) and the beer we ordered but he did not want anything.  So, I ended up leaving $10 on the table and we walked out.   \\n\\nSo then we left and went to dinner somewhere else....as we were still hungry.  \\n\\nAGAIN....WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF OUR LIVES."},{"name":"Q2 China Bistro","address":"472 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"I went to Q2 by myself one day for lunch and the staff was very kind, soft-spoken and attentive. \\n\\nI was immediately seated upon my arrival and a server was over right as I was sitting down.

I highly recommend the lobster bisque, crab cakes are less my thing, but the bisque is excellent, and the red door martini is also delicious (especially if you make it in during the happy hour!). I followed up with a dutch harbor crab (1lb) and the smaller size of the south african lobster tail (which you should really never pass up), both prepared just as you would hope for. My date got the chicken, he isnt much of a steak or seafood guy, but I have never known trulucks to disappoint, and alas a new fan was made. I had our waitress select a great dry white, it was perfectly complimentary to both my fish and his chicken, good enough to buy the bottle. We shared the creme brulee for dessert. The key to comfort in dining is detail. Removing and placing plates and settings with very little disruption. Taking crumbs and resetting napkins like youre passing a secret. Well timed execution, very little rushing, and yet lots of hospitality and enthusiasm. I dont know where any negative reviews have come from, they must be mistaken about which restaurant they ate at.

The female bartender with brunette hair (wish she actually introduced herself) made my friend and I feel uncomfortable the entire time we were there. She literally appeared to be on drugs, to the point of being mentally incompetent. I understand the vibe/theme to mirror that of the hippie movement, but having a bartender appear as though she was on some kind of trip herself takes it to a whole other level.\\n\\nTip to management: hire someone who is actually passionate about what they do instead of making guests feel like they are not wanted.

The pizza is still awesome and I'm sure they have their reasons for changing the prices, which the guy at the counter told me was now based on ingredients, therefore each pie is a different price rather than across the board the same price.  I get it, some ingredients are probably more expensive than others, so I see from a business perspective how this makes sense.  From a consumer perspective, I think they have priced themselves out of reach for some of their fan base, myself included.\\n\\nPrior to this pricing change, they were already a pricey option that was only a once in a while purchase.  Now, they are a never in a while purchase.  \\n\\nWith the price change, most of their pizzas have gone up in price on average 12.5%, with a few going up almost 30% (29.17%).  A few have gone down in price (about 8%).  \\n\\nThis pricing change is particularly painful because my favorite pizza was the Moon Dingo pie which increased from $24 to $30 (for an 18\\"), and this doesn't include tax.  My wallet and my mind have a hard time paying $30 + tax for a pizza.  \\n\\nThere are still a handful of pies that stayed the same or went down in price, and the base price of a plain cheese pizza only went up by $0.50, so if one of your favorite pies happens to be one of those, you probably won't notice the pricing difference, lucky you!  \\n\\nIt's definitely worth trying out, but unfortunately too expensive for me now."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So we came in at 9AM on a Sunday to try to beat the crowd.

I had wine, but my fiance had the Roasted Rye Maple (a stout) -- it was excellent!  Smokey with a touch of a sweet finish without too much carbonation.\\n\\nEverything on the menu (save the oysters) is locally sourced from the southeast US.

Most, last night at least, were from Florida and Georgia. +1 right there-- I love to support local businesses both directly and indirectly.\\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered the Country Ham Tasting and a side of Mac 'n Cheese.  The Ham Tasting came with 3 biscuits, pepper jam, farmhouse cheese, and pickled green strawberries.  All 3 types of ham were great, but my favorite was the Surryano-- cured for 400 days and then smoked.  Both the cheese and jam were great-- we made little ham sandwhiches out of everything.  The mac 'n cheese wasn't too rich like it can be-- the cheese was tangy (in a good way) but the sauce was a little soupy, not sure if this was intentional or not.\\n\\nWe finished the meal with the ice cream-- house made.  Rich and creamy, just like good ice cream should be.\\n\\nOnly have 2 complaints:\\n\\n1) LOTS of parking is blocked off for Valet and I can see it being a problem trying to find somewhere to self park on a Friday or Saturday evening.

The quality seems a bit disappointing, not even comparing them with California, just in rural places like Utah.  Like the shumai, it looked like a pile of melted goo, and taste mushy as well, not a whole lot going on with just plain pork.  Are shrimp that expensive next to the ocean?   Har Gow had thick skin, same with the rice rolls.  The best among what we got were the congee and the turnip cakes.  I suspect the owners came from northern China and are quite clueless on what dim sum should be in the south.\\n\\nWinsor Dim Sum being the only dim sum place I ever tried in Boston could very well be the best dim sum in town...

I did venture to several other subs here because I am hunting for the best Tuna Sub I can find, and this one is better than most.  At almost $8 this one's a bit more pricey than most places for a small - but bigger than many.  So if you don't mind a \\"day old rest of the sub\\" or if you're just hungry, it's well worth it because the tuna is nicely lubricating with good mayo (Hellmann's is my guess), nothing innovative but I order with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and onions.  The roll - as mentioned -  is not fluffy and light but dense with that classic olive infused outer crunch.  The Chicken in Chicken Parm sub is outstanding.  I got it plain but will add on next time.

Order a Large (16 inch) pizza and price is $14 which is very high for that size. They say you can get up to 2 toppings included but if your not a topping person than this is no help. The Extra Large pizza (18 inch) is $21 which is WAY too much but their reasoning is you get up to 4 toppings included. The customer service is good and the staff is friendly so others reviewers were right about that. \\nNow to the .....Too of my main visual qualities of a good pizza is a nice thick fluffy crust and thick gooey cheese that will slowly slide off of you hold up the pizza by the crust. Sliders pizza fails on both those counts. The overall taste was ok for \\"Florida pizza\\" but would not be acceptable in the northeast. So to sum it up we will probably not order from here again.

In no particular order, here's my reasons:\\n\\n*  Something about their little storefront with the \\"Contemporary Sardinian Cuisine\\" lettering on the windows caught my eye before they were even open for business.  Did I also spot a small, red \\"people love us on Yelp\\" sticker?  I may have.   \\n\\n*  Yelp deal:  Pay $10 for $20 credit.  I love a deal.    \\n\\n*  My friend had just put our name on the wait list at another place - a very loud, crowded place which came highly recommended - and I enticed her to walk over here to see which we might prefer.  The minute she saw how relatively quiet Maurizio's was it jumped to our #1 choice.  It's a restaurant in which you can conduct a leisurely conversation without yelling.  \\n\\n*  Attractive, intimate, and low lit environment on the main floor.  If I had been with someone different I might even call it \\"romantic\\".  (They also have a downstairs/basement dining room which I'd not put in this category).  \\n\\n*  Zero pressure to turn our table despite a (soon) full house.  We began with a bottle of wine, moved onto burrata, then shared another couple of antipasti (Mussels $12; Eggplant $10), each item ordered one at a time.  This is my favorite way to dine and the servers graciously permitted it.  \\n\\n*  The collective experience (food, drink, ambiance, and value) was 100% enjoyable.  \\n\\n*  Maurizio's chef is the same chef who put Giacomo's and Il Panino on the North End hot map.  This is him cooking his own food; his personal vision of a restaurant and he's been at it upwards of 20 years now.     \\n\\nI generally call myself a (4-star) fan if I've visited a place that I'd like to return to again, as opposed to trying something new or different.  Maurizio's?

Totally expected for a Saturday and I was thrilled that they'd text when the table is ready. My friends arrived 25 minutes later and we decided we'd grab a drink at the beer garden. Seeing that MOST waits end up being shorter than expected, thought it made sense to check in before we left. I approached a friendly hostess and explained we were thinking of grabbing a drink around the corner, but only if we had time. \\"You're still 40 minutes or more away from a table\\". Ok...cool. We popped into the beer garden, got one round and took our first sip when the text came in saying our table was ready?! What?! No exaggeration when I say that was six minutes after my conversation with the hostess. I called and planned on telling them we'd be there as soon as we finished our beers. The phone rang and rang. No answer. Ugh!!! I told my friends to drink fast and that I'd respond with a \\"1\\"....meaning we were on our way.

The look of this new restaurant in this space had me excited to eat here.  It is a clean space with great ambiance.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Beer menu was tasty and appropriately eclectic.  Unfortunately, the greatness stops there.  I often find that the overall quality of food at an American-pizza-pub can be decided by the ceasar salad.  It seems simple but there are many little elements that reflect the quality and intention of the cooking.  The lettuce was browned and looked like it had been pre-sliced out of a bag from some food service company instead of sliced in house, the dressing was very thin (thickness of ceasar is essential), there was very little dressing on the salad, and the cheese was like pre-bagged parmigiano(the same kind you would find in packets from take out pizza or in the jars on the table).  So that was blegh... then came the pizza.  We ordered the \\"shroom hunter\\" and \\"truffle shuffle\\".  Some of the worst pizza I've ever had in this city (high expectations here in Portland, folks).  One was served with a heap of arugula on top-- so much so that I didn't even recognize it as pizza.  I ordered a pizza not an arugula salad.  Both pizzas were slightly burnt on the bottom and tasted like a gourmet frozen pizza with loads of added cheese and oil.  Anyone who thinks this is good pizza is seriously missing out from the other delicious opportunities in the neighborhood and SE in general.  While the flavors on the pizza were of the fancier and more refined variety (which we absolutely live for), the end product was a huge failure for my, and my date's, taste buds.  Additionally, wine was way too expensive.  Sorry Double Mnt.  I really want to love this place because I've seen the building change hands so many times since I've lived in this hood and I really love what you've done with the place.  However, if you don't work on the quality and/or price of your food, I probably won't come back.

I ordered coleslaw and a chicken biscuit every time I came, which was at least once a week but often more.\\n\\nAbout two months in, you stopped serving coleslaw in the morning. (why? it's super easy to make and lasts a few days.) Then you'd sometimes have honey, sometimes not. One of your cashiers told me if I wanted honey, maybe Whole Foods would have some. Mmmmmm. Even when I'd come at lunch you'd sometimes be out of coleslaw or honey. Whole Foods is across the street - if you're out of something you should do what it takes to provide that product to your customers.\\n\\nHere we are about a year later, I infrequently try to get my morning fix at Hop's by ordering a chicken biscuit. And you wanna know where your consistency lies? You constantly don't have food to serve when you open at 8am. I've been told the last FOUR times I've been there between 8-8:10am that there is no food to serve and it'll be 15-20 minutes before there is. The staff is inattentive and unapologetic about the lack of food. You have a limited menu, I have trouble wrapping my head around the fact that you consistently don't have your main menu item prepped in time to open. \\n\\nIt's expensive, there are only like 10 things you can order, the service is lackluster, and most importantly - there's no damn food to eat. When it's available it's pretty tasty, but I'm tired of the bullshit, Hop's. This isn't a rash decision, it wasn't one bad experience. You've consistently let me down, and I'm just not gonna come back. I'll go out of my way to stop at Chick-Fil-A on Howell Mill before work, because they have everything you don't."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went to the picnic house for dinner and had looked beforehand at reservation times to see if we needed one. After seeing that there were several available within the following 15 minutes we figured it wasn't necessary. However upon arrival we were turned away because there were \\"reservations booked all through the evening\\". We found that odd so we booked a reservation online and went right back in. Upon our second arrival, it was pretty clear we were being treated differently, other couples in the waiting space were offered cocktails and seats at the bar and were told how long it would be for their table to be ready while we were left just waiting. This was quite frustrating due to the fact that we were simply turned away with no option of putting our name on the list, only to see others able to do so. We were not sure why this would happen and were both extremely disappointed as we had gone before and loved it there. Like I said, we both loved this restaurant, however, they lost a couple customers tonight."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Loved my visit here!

Can we also just mention that it's a rule not to come here and not get the pizza? Let's go ahead and put that in writing (although, order early and expect a bit of a wait, but you'll get a text when your pizza is ready). \\n\\nI know the beers change seasonally, but to give a little taste, I love that you can get the 4 oz. for $2-3 so you can essentially build your own flight. If you're going in the summer, don't get all the beers you want to try at once, since they'll just cool down. A few favorites of mine (I don't like anything too heavy/pale or with too many IBU's overall on an afternoon): the Vulgar Affectation (favorite!), Wytchmaker, and Ambree.

There isn't a lot to choose from above the border for authentic Mexican. There's a good place in Langley, a few decent places in Vancouver. I like this place. The fresh chips and choice of salsas (they used to have three choices, now they have two) The portion sizes are quite large, and typical of a south of the Canadian border restaurant. My DH can't get past the Chimichanga. Has it every time. We've also always had the Ceviche de Camarones. I've tried almost everything on the menu, but always stayed away from the Tilapia, until the last time. All I can say, is WHY did I wait? This would have been a 3 star review until now. There wasn't a tiny little piece of fish left. It was perfectly moist on the inside, crispy, almost bacon like skin on the outside and although Tilapia isn't the most flavorful fish there is, it was seasoned perfectly. I can only imagine how good this place would be if the cook was given a bigger kitchen and some help. \\n\\nI know that they are hindered by space and having to use a microwave for things. But I know the food is fresh, because I have a medical condition that usually means I should never eat in a Mexican Restaurant. I can get quite ill (and have in the past). But I've eaten here probably 20 times and I've always been fine.

The flavor was there\\n\\nThe Meat- Royal roast beef hit the ball out of the park with the roast beef. All the meat was a light pink shade which is the obvious result of a perfectly cooked roast. Every slice was evenly distributed on the roll which made every bite full. The flavor was there. \\n\\nThe Cheese- The sandwich came with one slice of white american cheese. With a sandwich of this size I would have liked to see 2 slices. Overall the flavor was there. \\n\\nThe Mayo- The mayo was smeared edge to edge but was a bit thin. Nothing more to be said about the mayo. The flavor was there. \\n\\nOverall this sandwich receives a 4/5 star rating.

But the atypical seating style help to make it a special evening, even for introverts, I would hazard. \\n\\nThe food was lovely, though I was getting a little full by the time the entry came.  My favorite course was probably the chilled vegetable soup-- flavorful and refreshing.  The entree was tasty, but the combination of pork + potatoes + tart fruity sauce made it feel like a fall/winter holiday meal, rather than something for high summer.  The various ingredients were all delicious and even though I spent more than I usually do, it was well worth it.  I hope I have another reason/special occasion/windfall to go back."},{"name":"Mr Everything Cafe","address":"899 Martin Luther King Jr Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was delicious after either adding salt or their sauce to flavor it.

Inside is very nice, cozy, romantic. The food - not so much though, I wouldn't go back on a groupon or otherwise.\\n\\nThey were nice enough to allow us to substitute the shared dessert with a second appetizer, so we ended up having two appetizers and two entrees (the deal was one appetizer to share, two entrees and one dessert). Before the dinner, instead of bringing us a basket of bread, the waitress gave us each half a piece of white bread to go with the olive oil dish. And by half a piece, I really mean half a piece! \\nPeriodically, she would come over and ask us if we wanted more bread and would give us another half a piece. Increadibly annoying! Why can't you give us a basket with a few pieces of bread in it?\\n\\nFor appetizers,  I had the crab cake, which was small and over fried. It was also served steaming hot, which I feel a crab cake should not be. It came with a side of mango cole slaw, which was a bit unusual, but not too bad. The person I was with ordered the tuna shashimi and liked it except for the sea salt bits on top. \\n\\nThen, for entrees we both had the mahi mahi, which was the special that day. It was lightly smoked, which gave it a taste I did not care for. In  my opinion mahi mahi does not need much to taste great, so I have no idea why they needed to smoke it and then broil it. It came with a side of white sweet potatoes, which had been mashed into a sause. I thought it was disgusting both in how it looked (it looked like a white puddle next to the fish) and the taste was just terrible. Why couldn't those be left as potatoes? I have no idea. \\n\\nI think my friend and I felt the same way about the dinner - it had the potential to be good, but then they kept doing something odd to the food, which ruined it. If they weren't trying so hard to be original, it would all have been much better. But I am not going back. Even with the groupon, it was pricey and not good, without the groupon, I would have been furious that I spent that much on a crappy dinner."},{"name":"Victor's Italian Restaurant","address":"560 Lincoln Ave","city":"Saugus","stars":"4.5","text":"Our favorite date night place!

There are plant of places to sit and enjoy yourself, both outside and under cover if need be.  The pizzas made in that brick oven onsite are also fantastic.

We added everything and requested the spice level at medium. \\n\\nTip: Sign up for their email list and you'll receive a coupon for a free appetizer (free & fresh guacamole? Yes, please!). It's valid for about 2 weeks so time your subscription accordingly. BTW you also get complementary chips & salsa when you arrive. The salsa has a nice kick to it. \\n\\nAll the adults at the table ordered a build your own combo - pick any 2 or 3 items (choice of tacos, enchiladas, tamales, chile rellano) served with rice, signature sweet corn tamalito and choice of: beans a la charra, refried beans, or vegetarian black beans.  I would totally order mine again - both the flautas and Chile rellano were so full of flavor. I love that they didn't skimp on the cheese on my Chile rellano. In fact, it was practically DRENCHED in cheese (insert heart emoji). The 2 combo is $14.99 and 3 combo option is just a buck more. \\n\\nFor kids on the fence between ordering off the regular adult or kids menu, consider this: there is a super fun build-your own-sundae-dessert included with the kids meal. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup, mini Oreos, gummies and rainbow sprinkles. Kids can add all or some of their toppings. Seriously, what kid wouldn't love that?!  For parents, what a great way to incentivize kiddos to finish their meal knowing this treat will follow!  This is the part where you tell the Chevys peeps, \\"Thank You!\\" \\n\\nWe noticed that our server was also doubled up that Sunday as the bartender. He was prepping & serving drink orders & refills and taking food orders very efficiently with minimal wait times to our section. Kudos for good service. \\n\\nWe didn't have any wait at lunch time on a Sunday but if there is a wait, there's a life size checkers table outside.

I am sure the food is fine, but from what i have heard the wine that they do have it overprices and its not that great to begin with... So basically everyone has been telling me to go and now I will be telling everyone not to go unless you like to wait for hours at a time to get in, circle round and round for a spot that you could potentially get a ticket in becasue it's all residential and even when you do get a spot you have to worry that someone will slice your tires....\\n\\nMoving on, I didn't even get to eat at this place because of the no reservations, and waiting for hours and hours. I walked in the door @ 6:45 and I already was uncomfortable because I was greeted by a curtain that forced me to be hovering in the doorway without being able to see anything.. then i left my name with the girl who tole me it should be 45 min to an hour, so i left and went home and waited for a call. well, i never got one... i called at 8:15 and i was told one couple was in front of me... I waited for another half an hour, and decided to go down to the north end to visit my good friend maurizio at maurizios restaurant, which btw i HIGHLY recommend. Anyways, I am almost done with my meal at maurizios when around 9:35 I get a phone call. The girl says to me \\"hi I am calling from rinos, I just wanted to make sure you found another place to eat\\" I was so mad i just replied yes and hung up because I was in a restaurant and did not want to make a scene. Just for the record, I neveer told this girl I was going some place else to eat, why would she assume that I did? On top of it all, when I did walk into the restuant and she took my name and number down, there were only 2 names above mines. Oh and just so everyone knows, there was only 2 of us trying to eat there, its not like I went with a whole group of people. \\n\\nMoral of the story? Unless you know someone that works there, you will not get in and will be treated like a tourist. Please do not give this place any business because of what I mentioned above and also because now that I have told many many people this story down the north end, I have come to find out the the owner of rinos is a you know what, I wont mention the exact words people used to describe him and many people have stopped doing business with him."},{"name":"Burger 21 - Mall of Millenia","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 109","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I enjoyed the fries more than the burger however the burger was average...seems a bit overpriced but services was awesome and the atmosphere was clean and comfortable..nice place to eat if in the area!!"},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is incredible!

I like when the evening turns this way. The casual, medium-sized bar is conveniently located on Peachtree, so it's ideal for a night of bar hopping. One advantage to this location is the tourists (in addition to locals) who frequent this bar. You might meet young men and women on business from different parts of the country, or in town for a wedding, etc. This is also a popular spot for Emory, Tech, and Georgia State students, overall producing a good mix of patrons. I've had several enjoyable conversations with people at this place; I've also spoken to some incredibly drunk people. Thus, Moondogs has a little of everything. There are a few pool tables, several large tables and couches, and a room with a stage and dance floor. Sometimes a band performs crowd-pleasing country and pop rock songs.

I originally wanted to bring a bigger group for dinner however they were very busy and I had to limit my dinner party.  Therefore I compromised and  decided to have an early dinner at 6pm and meet  others at the bar 8:30pm.  I communicated so much with the management the week before of my plans. After dinner, I was told that I would have the next bar table so I did not have to hover over tables as people finish their stay.  They lied to me and the next table was taken by another group. I approached the staff again, they told me I could have the next table.  A table became available and I checked with the host and asked if my party could occupy this table.  He said yes and therefore I moved my party to this open table. Soon after, the host approached me to tell me that these bar tables were being used for dinner tables.  He had made a mistake. . Then the host said that he would make an exception, a favor,  however only 4 of my group could sit at the tables and the other members could not stand nearby. It was ridiculous to ask that I split up my party in the bar area.  So my entire group had to evacuate these tables and go back to our original area.  Management did  nothing to accommodate my group in the bar.  They seemed to accommodate others but not my group.  All I that wanted was good customer services and not special favors.  I guess I did not know how to earn the host's good favor.  \\n\\nThese bar tables are in the middle of the bar and are meant for people to sit and stand around. These tables are suppose to be bar tables on the first-come first serve basis.  In fact I had asked if I could reserve these tables for dinner and I was told no.  I had brought 15 people to their bar and restaurant.  They had the power to help me find a nice comfortable place for my group and they refused.  I was very disappointed and will definitely not return.

When it came out my friend and I were cracking up, it was the saddest looking little steak that I was paying $22 for!  I believe there were maybe ten bites.  Luckily I got a side of mashed potatoes for an extra $5 which were nothing special, they actually tasted like the powder ones or maybe they just over whip them.

We had: carne asada, carnitas and pollo tacos, cocnut mussels, carne guisada bocadillos and carne empanadas. \\n\\nThe tacos were pretty decent - good flavour and balance. For my money I'd rather eat tacos at La Taqueria. Carne Asada, steak slices topped with guacamole, was my favourite (I can't resist anything with guac apparently). I have some high standards when it comes to carnitas (California, baby) but this one was a bit of a let down. It was rather dry and the pickled vegetables were a bit of a miss. Pollo was good but nothing exciting to be honest.\\n\\nOnto the mussels: they weren't overcooked as often is the case for mussels served in restaurants, which I was very pleased about. Good enough.\\n\\nEmpanadas were supposed to have been made with beef and chorizos but I mainly found ground beef with taco seasoning. Meh. Not too crazy about them.\\n\\nNow the bocadillo was a pleasant surprise. The meat was juicy and flavourful and the arugula and caramelized onions made the sandwich that much better.

Served with pasta del giorno.) for a bit of veggie in my meal, while my dc selected the Spezzatino Abruzzese $9.50 (Chicken in a light butter and cream sauce with penne.) that I had also been considering.  Our lunches were preceded by a plate of thin sliced bread and a cup of pesto dipping sauce that did fine at passing the time but the bread itself was kind of plain.\\n\\nEntrees, however, arrived shortly after, with 5 folded slices of eggplant fanned out on the plate accompanied by some red sauced penne.  The chicken dish was similarly penned, but the chunks of chicken were tender and tasty.

The wine also paired well with the cheeses that we chose, making the experience well worth the stop. \\n\\nThroughout our stay, the restaurant stayed completely full, but the noise level never got so overbearing that we could not hear each other.

The ribs were a slightly sweet perfectly smoked, and had the perfect pull, the sirloin was very tasty with a topping that complimented the meat, the sausage was probably the best I ever had and was topped with a relish that could easily be addicting. Last bit not least the charred okra was tender and grilled just right. The tomato cucumber salad was incredible with grape tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, and I believe dill seasoning with a slightly sweet vinegarette dressing.

We got a really good South Africa bottle of ros√© that was very good too!! For entrees I went with the Hake Marsala and it was soooo soft and just melts in your mouth!! My husband got the mussels and he lovedd it!! I found it to be alittle salty but it was fine. Our friends both got the lobster rolls and they said it was delicious too!

The waitress also made sure that our water glasses were never empty, which was even better. The noodles were just ok, it's probably best to stick with regular dim sum entrees.

However, I go here at least once a month so the 5 stars was pretty much solidified for me (I try lots of different restaurants, so when a restaurant is frequented this often for me, it is good!).\\n\\nSo, about the restaurant, Holy Taco is located in East Atlanta Village (which, BTW, is a great place to just take a stroll, window shop, or see local acts as well).  They serve Latin-American like food.   Yum, it is good.   I started going here when it opened in 2008.  Their food is excellent in addition to the prices.  One minor gripe- they don't serve chips and salsa for free.  I suppose this could be viewed positively though in that you are not going to completely and utterly pig out, unless of course it is on your tab.  They have varying types of salsas to choose from, and from what I can recall they range from $1-$4 in price (and come with chips).  So most likely this won't dent your wallet and hopefully won't deter anyone from visiting this rad spot.\\n\\nMy fave thing here are the veggie quesadillas.  I have also had their pescado (fish) tacos which are fab as well.  And I always get their yummy guacamole... Their chips are seemingly homemade and are really awesome so be sure to order a basket.

I only choked it down because someone was treating me to a \\"special meal\\".  The uninspired Caesar salad arrived and I had to ask for dressing as it did not taste like it had anything besides Parmesan cheese on it. When the dressing arrived I realized it was because the Cesar dressing had absolutely no taste to it. Croutons, chopped slightly wilted lettuce, and Parmesan.  I ordered the veal Gorgonzola as when prepared well it should be a rare treat. While the veal cutlet itself was \\"ok\\" it was swamped in a brown mushroom sauce that vaguely tasted like Gorgonzola. It tasted like someone had mixed brown gravy packet sauce with some rancid melted cheese.  I was expecting a light brownish sauce with Gorgonzola sprinkles over a nice nude cutlet. The vegetable side consisting of a\\nMix of peppers and potatoes was overcooked, lifeless, and cold. My friend had the veal Parmesan.  Normally something also very good, it consisted of a soggily breaded veal cutlet topped with some kind of gooey melted cheese and a tomato sauce reminiscent of spaghetti-os. The accompanying pasta marinara had very little of the spaghetti-o tasting sauce on it, and was made with overcooked noodles that tasted like the Kroger plain label kind. The only thing that was really good was the tiramisu, which was superb. I'm sorry but Ninos  chefs need to be re introduced to their recipes.

(Just a suggestion - I would reconsider this method, it makes the guest feel like a number)  For dinner, we had mussels and oysters to start (both were great) and for dinner I had the crab cakes and my husband had the fish and chips.  Both were cooked perfectly and portion size was decent.  The sides, however, fell a bit flat.  The coleslaw was unseasoned and the apple/carrot salad served with the crab cakes was missing something (maybe arugala?).  The menu is enormous, lots of good options as well as daily specials.

As I was looking over the menu I came across something new called the Chevy's Burger.\\n\\nI looked at my wife and said, \\"They now have a burger! A seasoned hamburger patty with green chiles, avocado and jalape√±o-Jack cheese in a grilled flour tortilla.\\"  And my wife said, \\"Let's get it!\\"  It is called the El Mexi Burger!!!  I must say that Chevy's has finally redeemed themselves with us.  It was cooked a perfect medium rare too.  It is sad for me to say the best thing on the menu here is the burger...that is so American of me.  But this place calls themselves Mexican food and I know that is not true...so I think we are even on the assumptions!!!\\n\\nThe burger came with natural potato chips too and they were some of the best chips I have ever had.  They were served warm and I am sure that Chevy's deep fried them fresh before serving them.\\n\\nThere is a balloon person here and it drives me crazy because they target the kids tables and then want tips for making a sword or a hat.  Do they understand that I can get the Disney Hotel employees to make me as many balloon animals, crowns, swords and 4foot walking people, without it even costing me a dime.  I just look at my little one and say...we have 50 balloons in our room already and that gets me out of it!!!\\n\\nThe service is always a little disorganized but we have come to expect this in Southern Florida especially during high season and the hotels are full of tourists.\\n\\nMy four stars is for the new burger, chips and salsa and the happy hour margaritas.

I was in PDX for a weekend visit and my sister suggested we try this place. I love ice cream, like a lot, but I try not to eat it too often. I was very intrigued after looking at their website. They clearly have some very interesting flavors going on.\\n\\nThere were definitely quite a few people in here, but nothing insane. The wait gave us a chance to peruse the menu and figure out what we wanted. When our turn came, I just had to get a taste of the pear and blue cheese. It was soooo delicious. It tasted very much of pear initially and the blue cheese was a subtle aftertaste. I ended up getting a split single scoop of Arbequina Olive Oil and Mint Chocolate Chip with Lemon Confetti while my sister got Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache.\\n\\nIt's hard to describe the Olive Oil... very creamy and a bit salty? That's the best I can do. Very tasty. I was really curious how lemon would taste in mint chocolate chip, turns out it really gives an brightness to the flavor. I tried my sister's and it was yummy delicious also. Clearly Salt & Straw has it figured out!\\n\\nBesides the ice cream, the shop is really cute and they carry cool little gifts and candy.

Service was terrible - there were plenty of employees but no one really providing any kind of real service to any of the guests. We had to keep hunting down a server to get refills for our drinks, the extra plate I asked for never came and the sauce we asked for when we placed our order never came either. The ordering process is awkward, to say the least. You place your order at a counter,  then they give you a number and a server brings your food to you. Sounds simple enough,  but the menus are at said counter, so if you're standing in line behind someone who is ordering, and they've never been there before, you have to wait for them to go over the menu and then order? With as many people they had on payroll, it would definitely function and flow better if guests were seated and the servers took the orders. With a name like Pig Floyd's,  I expected a more edgier (I'm sure that's not even a word lol) and more rock n rollier (that one either!) atmosphere. On to the food ... it was OK ... I've definitely had better BBQ. Our food came out in record time, but wasn't piping hot like it had just been prepared ... more lukewarm like it had been sitting in a steam table. The tacos were ok - we got the pork belly and the al pastor,  both a little in the dry side for my liking. The ribs were pretty good, though.  They would have been better if they were actually HOT, as if they had just come off the grill! I could see the vision of the type of food they are trying to serve, but the execution was a bit lackluster. Lastly, a very creepy tall guy (who I am only going to assume was management) came out and hurriedly and insincerely asked each table if everything was ok ... why bother asking if you really don't care?

He's a friend of mine, and he is Chinese Malaysian originally from a city called Ipoh. He also used to work here, and so did another friend of mine and they suggested some dishes to me if I wanted to eat here. Since the owner is originally from Malaysia and is Chinese, obviously I decided to get the more Malaysian and Indonesian influenced dishes. By doing that, I was able to enjoy my food a little better, and found the food to be tasty, not terrible. \\n\\nFirst time I came here I got Chow Kueh Teow, which is a stir fried rice noodle dish, mixed with some spices, shrimp, bean sprouts, and eggs. This is a quintessential dish found in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and is also known as Chao Guo Tiu in Cantonese Chinese, and Chao Guo Tiao in Mandarin Chinese. The dish is served in a caldron shaped pot. I thought the dish was tasty, and the presentation was fairly good. It's a great choice for lunch or a light dinner. I really liked the spiced flavor and the texture of the noodles. \\n\\nMy friend suggested the Ipoh Seafood Chow Fun. This is a rice noodle soup made from scrambled eggs, with shrimp, scallops and squids. A great choice when the weather is less than a dismal 18 degrees Celsius, since it comes in fairly hot. The seafood was decently good, but I really enjoyed the broth and the noodles. It is also a good choice for a light dinner as well. \\n\\nThe dish that I enjoyed the most was probably the Kapitan Chicken, which was also suggested by my friend. This is chicken mixed with shredded onion and coconut simmered in Malaysian spices. Although it is one of the most expensive dishes at $15, it comes with rice and a small salad. The chicken was really tasty, and I really liked mixing it with the rice. The flavor was really good, and had a small spice as well. \\n\\nIf you are only going for the lunch specials, my only suggestion is to get the Chicken Curry. They do a decent job with it, but the sauce was a little watery. Another way to enjoy your dining experience is try to get a seat by the window. It's at a great location and the prices may be a little high, but reasonable. \\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for a Malaysian influenced restaurant at a great location near Newbury Street, this is a really good choice depending on what you order. There are not many Malaysian influenced restaurants I could think of in Boston, and this is the 3rd place I have visited in this city. This place seems to be doing fairly well, and I would not mind coming back here again for more Malaysian influenced dishes."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here with some friends on a restaurant hop (let's be serious it's so much better than a bar hop). This dim sum place is the type where you order off the menu and they bring out fresh versus the traditional ones with the ladies carting your selections around. I didn't mind because I usually point and use smoke signals anyway to designate what I want. My dining companions are Chinese, which I think made it easier when selecting our food options. We got all the traditional (which I only know by picture and not name). The only ones I know are shumai, Chinese broccoli, the rice rolls with shrimp, pork spare ribs, chicken feet, and of course hot tea. \\n\\nFood came out pretty promptly and was steaming hot. When we immediately used our chopsticks to pick up the shrimp dumplings, the wrappers would tear open since they were still so hot...pretty unfortunate. When we walked into the restaurant there was a funky smell, which one of our friends said smelled like sewage. Also, it was super awkward because we were the loudest ones in the restaurant.

It's a super cool concept. Pay $10 ($5 for kids) and spend an hour in a beautiful, clean, comfortable room full of kitties! What better way to find a cat to adopt, than to observe them in a natural setting? The kitties (usually about 12 or 13 of them) have full access to what is made to resemble a large studio apartment, complete with a living room, dining area, and a big sunny window ledge for snoozing or watching the passers-by. All of the furniture and decor is cat-friendly, with cat trees, hidden nooks and hollow wicker end tables that double as places for the cats to play hide and seek. Most of the cat-themed artwork on the walls is for sale, and there are cool mugs and t-shirts for sale as well. If you opt for any of the drinks or prepackaged treats that they have for sale in the lobby, I highly recommend the cupcakes from the Pattycake Bakery. Yum! There are many different toys conveniently located throughout the space, designed to engage the cats, should they be feeling playful. If the kitties are snoozing, you can sit close and read, or color in one of the many coloring books available at the tables, work on a puzzle, or play a cat-themed board game with friends. Kids older than 6 are welcome with parental supervision, but in my opinion, the older, the better. Several of the kids who were there the first day I went left their trash laying about. Not cool. Be sure to check out the photos on their back wall of all of the adoption success stories. Walk ins are welcome, but their website makes it just as easy to book a reservation. A reservation will ensure your entire party can enter together, as they only allow about 15 folks in at a time. If you are looking for a cat to adopt, simply love cats, or perhaps you wished you had a cat but are unable, check this place out.

Pretty building. There are valets, but you can self park for free right around the corner of the building. The Eleven restaurant is located on the rooftop... Take elevator to the Penthouse. There is open patio seating for \\"drinks and appetizers only\\" and a small conversation area with a few couches in front of a fireplace. There is also a pool.. although no one was in it at the time.. The sign said pool closes when dining begins. The building and open rooftop area are nice, you walk into the lobby of the hotel and there is a small fountain and seating area with a player piano running on automatic. The inside dining tables in Eleven are large round brown plastic wicker with glasstops.. The Disney Fireworks too far.. a small flash in the distance. Check the times for fireworks as they vary. Our reservations were for 8pm and fireworks were set for 10pm. Service was extremely slow and non attentive. Food was mediocre and overpriced. We had many of the menu items. They serve Pepsi products, beer, wine, and full bar service.. Prices range from $6 for a beer to $280 for a bottle of champagne or wine. Ordered the mussels which were the evening special not on the menu, (2) Caprice salads (which is Two slices of beefsteak tomato and three slices of Mozzarella drizzled with the balsamic dressing), (1) Braised rib sliders (3 small sliders, did not eat, they are salt balls) (2) French Onion soups (no complaints from persons ordering), (2) Shrimp cocktail which came in a large martini glass and black bean salsa, and (1) Pork Chop entree (ordered medium well.. came rare). 4 Bar drinks (2) Bloody Mary's (first was great.. 2nd.. not so much), (2) Long Island Iced Teas (not sure there was any alcohol in there at all tasted like sour mix) 1 Beer, and A Pepsi. They will bring you fresh pretzel bread rolls, but you have to ask.. and will wait as they make them fresh? Entree's range in price from $24 - $55 and sides are extra. We opted to stretch the meal time with appetizers and drinks for the fireworks and only one of us had an actual entree.. Total Bill $191 before tip.

First, they have a really decent bottle of wine (variety of which I can't remember, but it was a long Italian name that started with an M) for $13. Hey! That's friggin' cheap!\\n\\nMy friend started with the beet bruschetta which was amazing, and I didn't think I was a fan of beets. Of course, the fact that the beets were on top of goat cheese and bread might have helped in making me a fan.\\n\\nI started with the small spinach salad. This salad is what the spinach salad at Enoteca wants to be. The gorgonzola dolce isn't over powering like the Enoteca version, but matches in size and amount perfectly with the sweet nuts. The dressing is light and balanced rather than overly tangy too. I really love that salad!\\n\\nFor an entre my friend had the Panzanella, which I thought about getting and decided against. I'll try it next time though if I can stray from the spinach salad. It was butternut squash, white beans and bread with greens and the bite I had was yummy. \\n\\nMy entre was the taglitelle with bolognese. The pasta was so perfectly cooked, and I wonder if it was homemade pasta. I'm not sure because I did see boxes of pasta in the kitchen, but I do remember seeing that something was handmade on the menu. Anyway, it was so good. I can never eat an entire serving of pasta in a restaurant, but not only was this so good that I did, it was also a normal human being sized serving and not that which looked fit for a giant.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the Panna Cotta with caramel. The caramel was a really light syrup that tasted super buttery and rich, but not in an icky, greasy way. \\n\\nThe ambiance of the place is great too. I love the way it looks and the layout.

The vegan chili was amazing and full of salivating flavor and of the three options the chili was the the best. My recommendation is to call ahead and get a reservation or be prepared to wait."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"4400 Ashford-Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3005","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This is the best Cheesecake Factory location. I actually live closer to the Buckhead location but refuse to go there because of the inconsistent service and crazy wait times. I have been to the Perimeter location a substantial number of times and have never had to wait more than 30 minutes. The service is generally pretty good. The food of course is not off the charts, but there are some good dishes on the menu. There are about a bazillion menu items so you should be able to find something you like. \\n\\nAs an appetizer I like the Buffalo Blast Bites (they're spicy!). I am sad they removed the Brushetta from the appetizer line up - it was excellent! I always get a sandwich here - I like the Classic Club sandwich and the Chicken Avocado Club the best. I have had some pasta dishes and they were only \\"ok\\" to me. As far as desert of course you have to get a slice of cheesecake (although their chocolate cakes are off the charts good too!). I am so happy they introduces the Dulce de Leches cheesecake a few years ago - it's my absolute fav and you must try this is you like caramel. The Cheesecake Factory is a step up from your standard casual dining chains so don't come here expecting a full out gourmet experience."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We went today to Rino's.  A Tuesday.  We took the train, not a bad walk from Wood Island Station.  We arrived around 3 pm.  Walked right in.  When we left around 4ish, there was a small wait, but nothing crazy.  We heard the waitress tell another table Thursday - Friday it can be a 3 hour wait.\\n\\nThe food - We went on an empty stomach and had a late lunch/early dinner.  I went with lobster ravioli's based on all the reviews and the Diners, Drive Ins and Dives episode.  So, so good.  Totally worth it and the reviews are right! We also had the Chicken Parm  - very tender and well hammered out.  We had Brucshetta and Arancini for apps.  The Bruschetta was very good, we had to try it, but would not necessarily get it next time, as there is other stuff to try on the menu.  The Arancini was AWESOME!  Could have had it as a meal!  Best I have had since my grandmother passed away.  With all that food, there was leftovers and no room for dessert  - which was a bummer, since they all looked good.\\n\\nService - A couple of people have posted the service wasn't good.  Ours was just fine.  The waitress was attentive enough, water glasses were consistently filled and she checked in enough, without being annoying.  I think people have to remember the food is FIVE star, but at he end of the day the restaurant is considered a \\"Diner, Drive in or Dive.\\"  It is not suppose to be considered a FIVE STAR restaurant, with the bells and whistles of service...it does have FIVE STAR food. \\n\\nI will say towards the end of our meal, when a wait began, no one in the restaurant felt rushed to finish and leave.

Everything is fresh and delicious. I could leave it at that, but I'll expound. The oysters and steamers (steamed clams) are plump. Fried calamari is perfectly crisp, and one of the best versions I've had. If you like mussels, it doesn't get much better than their mussels Provencal.  In the mood for salad? I recently had some of Stacey M.'s crunch salad with buffalo popcorn shrimp and enjoyed the texture and flavors. I visited once with my father, who also loves Turner's, partially because they offer Finnan Haddie, and old-school haddock dish, done right here. \\n\\nDrinks and dessert are on point.

Cool bar area, and dining room space, too. It was quite busy last night and it was loud-- didn't mind it too much though, it's not the type of place for a long dinner date anyways, more of like a quick bite. The crowd was a melting pot! There were older people, younger people, kids, college students... really something different- I guess it applies to all!  My boyfriend and I got the buffalo brussel sprouts-- really something cool and different, would get it again! Then I got the gnocchi and an arugula salad. The salad was perfect with blood oranges, dates, and almonds.. only complaint was that there was not enough dressing and none came alongside it, by the time the server came back to see how we were doing I was already done. I did not love the gnocchi. I could be wrong, but I remember them being advertised as in a beef ragu. There was slow braised beef in the dish, but it was more of a stew than a ragu, it also had carrots and potatoes. I was thinking it would be a pasta dish with beef- I guess like a bolognese with gnocchi.  It was too salty for me and I only finished half. Boyfriend got the Cuban Reuban and said it was good. We ordered two beers- dogfish head ipa, my favorite! and a 220z beer of the gods. I spotted it on the menu and had to have it- only complaint is that our server did not know anything about it saying he had never tried it before when I asked him a question. I was bummed, but still ordered it. It was good, but I preferred my IPA to it. Bill came to $72 including tip, which felt like a lot, but we did get one appetizers, one salad, one sandwich, one gnocchi( which is listed as an appetizer) and two beers, one of which was $14.00, so I guess it adds up...Not sure how I feel about this place, it's got me on the edge!

My one and only gripe with Bravo is that if you're not careful everything you order can be heavy with grease, salt, or a deep fry. What's not to love? At TNS you get all that AND a better selection of food you want to keep on eating.

Anna was setting tables outside and was very nice to let me inside to view the wine selection for a later visit.  I was most interested in Reds from Paso Robles since I had visited Paso in the summer of '08.  No interesting Paso wines other than Denner Viognier and several Turley Zin's.  Both great wines, but not of my preference for today.\\n\\nTaste did have some very good Oregon and Sonoma Pinot's that I have experienced before.\\n\\nMy later visit came the same evening after an early dinner in East Austin at a great Tex Mex place.\\n\\nIt was not crowded, because it was early around 7PM.  The wait staff was incredible.  I was attended at the bar by \\"Buzz\\" aka Cornelius, Sabrina, and Kristin.  All were very helpful and nice.\\n\\nI selected the Pinot from L'Angevin.  I have never tried this vineyard, but Sonoma is known for very good Pinot's as long as you do not scrimp on the price point.  My thought was to advance to a Syrah to finish, but the Pinot was so good, I stayed with the same wine for the night.  On the 3rd glass, a new bottle was opened that did not quite taste right.  No problem, Sabrina sampled the wine, agreed and opened a new bottle that was as good as the first 2 glasses of L'Angevin Pinot.  I hate complaining and wasting a bottle of wine, but if it is not right, it should be made right.  Management gathered around, sampled the \\"corked\\" bottle and all seemed to agree, that this was a bad bottle.\\n\\nNot planning to eat since I had the \\"early dinner\\", I tried their cold chickpea salad.  This was an incredible fusion of flavors that included the namesake chickpeas, cilantro, Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced salami, and some type of complementary cheese.

I have been a fan for years, and have never been disappointed in what I have ordered there. The lobster ravioli, the homemade pasta, the stuffed eggplant appetizer, everything is delicious, reasonably-priced, and will often provide you with enough food for days.\\n\\nHowever, I am decidedly NOT a fan of the hostess(es?) and the way they deal with walk-ins. It is a very small restaurant, and you will almost undoubtedly have to wait for a table since they do not take reservations for groups smaller than 6. Personally I have never waited LESS than an hour, and for the past year most of my experiences have involved ordering takeout (which is great and painless). However, this past week I decided to risk the wait to dine-in with a friend who had never had the pleasure, and it was definitely not a very pleasurable experience. \\n\\nIn short, I feel that the absolute refusal on the part of the hostess to give any estimate whatsoever of the time you will have to wait is at the very least unfortunate and at worst perhaps a little ethically questionable, considering they own the bar/\\"waiting room\\" across the street that you are almost forced to patronize and spend money in. We showed up at 5:20pm to see about a table for two, and were told there were eight parties in front of us, but the hostess refused to give any estimate of the wait time--\\"It depends on how quickly people eat.\\" Now, I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure that is the case in EVERY busy restaurant. If you aren't brand new to the restaurant business, though (and Rino's is far from new!), one would think that you would have SOME idea of the turnover rate, and be at least able to give customers a BALLPARK of how long they may have to wait, especially if that wait is likely to be extreme! As I said, we had eight parties in front of us at 5:20pm. After two hours, two (admittedly tasty) appetizers and three drinks each--$75 spent--across the street, we felt we HAD to be close (and we did not want to be too full to enjoy the enormous portions!) so we walked back over to check again, only to find that there were STILL four parties ahead of us. We chose to stick it out after waiting that long, and we did not get seated until 8:15, THREE HOURS after our initial arrival. I have no problem waiting for a table, but I don't think anyone in their right mind expects to wait three hours, and I don't think any meal is worth a wait like that, no matter how delicious. Furthermore, as we were sitting down, someone else inquired about the wait for a table, and we overheard the hostess responding that it should be begin to improve since \\"this is around when people start to give up and drop out.\\" From this a suspicious person might then surmise that a possible reason for refusing to give any estimate of wait times could be that hungry, hopeful customers would very likely deign to have a drink or two at the bar while they wait, and then even if those customers give up 2+ hours in, Rino's will still have managed to make SOME money off of them via profitable alcohol purchases, whereas if that hostess had told us up front that \\"it could be 2-3 hours,\\" we might very well have given up immediately and Rino's would not have gotten any money from us! The alternative would seem to be that the hostess simply does not pay any attention to the turnover rate and is thus incapable of even guessing...either way, not a ringing endorsement of the restaurant's management and its respect for its customers\\n\\nBottom line is the food at Rino's remains fantastic, very possibly the best Italian food anywhere in Boston, but if you intend to eat at a normal (popular) hour, unless (a) you have a friend or relative who lives in the neighborhood and wants to host you beforehand or (b) you have more than six people in your party and can make a reservation, I HIGHLY suggest calling in a take-out order. Finding a great Italian meal in Boston should not involve wasting so much time that you could have just driven to an Italian restaurant in New York."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I was here for my friend's birthday recently, after much urging to try it from my girlfriend and her friends.

We ordered a Caribbean roll, shrimp tempura roll, and the sashmi platter. The shrimp tempura roll was the usual shrimp tempura roll, which is a good thing. The Caribbean roll was interesting. It had scallops, and I never had a scallop-filled sushi roll. There was also avocado and mango in this roll. I did not know what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was very tasty. For the sashimi platter, all the fish tasted fresh, but I especially enjoyed the tuna, but I am not a fan of yellow tail. \\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered the chili jam with chicken and pad se-ew with pork. The pad se-ew was okay. Nothing spectacular. The chili jam started off well, but for some reason, as I continued eating it, I gradually started to dislike it. I believe the reason for this is because it may have been a little too sweet for me. I know it says on the menu it's a sweet dish, but I found it too sweet.\\n\\nSome really delightful happened when we received the check. They gave us a $10 gift card! We did not make any complaints about the food, we were having a great time, so I found it odd that we received the gift card. It was a nice gesture.

Let's be honest, small-dish menus require quite a bit of discusion, and rap music is not conducive to such an environment. \\n\\nOf special note were a few items not currently listed on the menue, but here goes anyway: roasted jalapenos with garlic aioli (a little intense, and I needed extra aioli, but excellent).

The other dishes on the menu also looked incredibly delicious. \\n\\nDid also have the calamari, but unfortunately had the order for carry-out, so the calamari was a little soggy upon arrival at the final destination.  The calamari did have some good seasoning, but was a fairly average dish.  \\n\\nAs stated above, we had the food for carry-out, but even finding a parking spot just to run in and pick up the food was a hassle.  The restaurant itself is very small and cozy, but again it is VERY SMALL.  There was no room for us to stand even to pick up our orders.  The location is somewhat T accessible, but is on the blue line.

It started out with them noting that they are out of hot tea. Then it turned out that there is no bottled still water either.

Fajitas were not sizzling by any means either, they were served slightly warm. Other tables were getting sizzling ones, so perhaps we just got unlucky on that one. The amount of steak was very small, it's drowned in onions. The meat was tasty however. The rice and beans tasted like something directly out of a can. One of the worst rice preparations I've ever tried. Stale texture and synthetic taste. On top of it, we had a small request of bringing out something spicy like a diced jalape√±o and a hot sauce. Hot sauce never came out.Had to remind our waitress, interestingly named Cinnamon, multiple times about it until she brought only the jalape√±os. Closing the check was no less of an adventure, she took a long time to come around and charged for teas that they were out of. She did take it off, but I also noticed a charge for that sliced jalape√±o. That's the first time I see a restaurant do that and feel like it's a little overload, given the cost of a jalape√±o is a few cents and they charged a dollar. I wasn't going to argue over a dollar, but as a matter of principle, that was just silly. If they want to count pennies like that, they won't win any friends in customer service. If I were to visit again, maybe I should count the slices of steak on the fajitas and hold them accountable. \\n\\nOverall, part of the experience was as bad as it was because of the service.

I figured the Chef wanted it served that way, so just went with it, but in short, I like my soups hot.

Between their lascivious outings, I recommend that the salacious crowd find their way to Nino's because it is an exquisite, intimate, and almost romantic dining experience.  I say ALMOST romantic because, although the lighting and atmosphere are indeed intimate, the cramped nature of the restaurant's interior means that you're nigh within arm's reach of every adjacent table.  But hey, Nino's is an Italian restaurant, so when you're there, you're family.  A fellow customer even smiled at me, shook my hand, and wished a Merry Christmas to me just as he was leaving and as I was waiting to be seated.  Perhaps it was the due to the Christmas spirit, alcohol, my affable demeanor, and/or the aforementioned sense of camaraderie engendered by Nino's romanticized setting?  In any case, I was both surprised and delighted by that friendly gesture, and the hostess was somewhat puzzled and curious, asking if I knew that guy.  \\n\\nOther than our Latino server, Nino's seemed to be an authentic Italian eatery, and everyone in my dinner party seemed to enjoy their entrees.  I ordered the grouper cartoccio, which was quite satisfying, with a remarkable presentation.  Plus, I used the complimentary bread to soak up the juices that my grouper cartoccio was swimming in.  Yummy.  Also complimentary are the bruschetta appetizers.  Yay!  \\n\\nFinally, and this bears repeating, Nino's dining area is rather confined.  I was in a party of 9, and the posted maximum occupancy is a mere 70 individuals.  Thus, Nino's is a fine choice to accommodate a gathering of close friends, but not for those with enough children to warrant owning a mini van."},{"name":"Bahama Breeze","address":"1540 Rinehart Rd","city":"Sanford","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was goood and the bartenders were great.

We ordered seafood scallion pancake and rib eye steak from the BBQ entrees. Notice that their BBQ entree comes together with 3 pcs of shrimp, small salad, steamed rice, kimchi, vegetables for cooking, and miso soup. That was kinda filling for us. The seafood scallion pancake was good, but bigger and thicker than we were expecting. We both really enjoyed the ribeye steak. The waitress brought over two sauces, but the steak is already marinated, so we didn't even use them. On the downside, our steamed rice came very late; we almost forgot about it completely. \\n\\nWe both think this place is overpriced, but the staff is friendly.

Where exactly is the potato? Well logically it made sense, but it didn't offset the taste nor did it make it stray from an anticipated doughnut. It was simple, yet elegant, and due to its size, I took it quite slow for the sake of enjoyment. The light custard subtly meshed with the sugary sweet but was not the victor in this dish.\\n\\nFrittata with Asparagus, Oregon Nettles, Caramelized Onions, Fromage Blanc - a nice pan-made dish with flavors that were precisely complementary. The sweetness drawn from the onions countered the tartness of the nettles and asparagus leaving the bitterness of the cheese to bring everything home. The egg base stood as the foundation hosting the ingredients which, together, made for a dish that was savory indeed.\\n\\nGlazed Yam with Cumin-Maple - had the flavors in force and wonderful for consumption. The maple combination to sweeten the naturally sweet spice (a variation of Cardamom it would seem) was a nice little trick. The yam itself roasted and cooked evenly, tasting almost 'buttery' when it hit the tongue.\\n\\nFried Egg 'n Cheddar Biscuit with Fried Chicken - held many things I enjoy in breakfast food: fried, cheese, eggs, buttermilk. One of the true winning dishes, with the cheese placed moments before serving and the chicken hot and juicy to the bite. If I had this every day I would need to be rolled around, but for this particular  day, this dish made for an easy eat reminiscent of several childhood fast-food favorites. Though it held the concept intact, the combination was certainly heartier and more flavorful than those old favorites.\\n\\nDecor was a combination of metals and woods and served with clean whites and clears.

The hostess was so nice and accommodating, and we had friendly service from beginning to end.  The decor is a mix of steampunk and roaring twenties-- the music is classic ragtime/20s jazz, it's dimly lit by Schoolhouse Electric-type lighting, there are wall decals depicting hot air balloons, etc.  It looks like it used to be the lobby of a very old hotel.  \\n\\nThe drinks alone are worth the visit.  The extremely talented (if hipsterishly attired) bartender created all of the seasonal drinks himself.  The Smashing Pumpkin (Thanksgiving in your mouth) and Persephone's Palm were our favorites.  I ordered absinthe (\\"served the traditional way\\") since it was on the menu and I'm an absinthe fan, but I was surprised to find it disappointing: the waiter brought a proper glass of Lucid absinthe, an absinthe spoon, a sugar cube, and a tiny silver tea pot (the single-serve kind you find in restaurants) of lukewarm water.  He proceeded to spill everywhere, including on me, as he dumped the water quickly over the sugar cube.  It had only partially dissolved when he tipped it into the glass and mashed it down with the spoon, then told me to do the rest.  If they have \\"traditional\\" absinthe on the menu, they should know that the water needs to be ice cold (so that the louche develops properly), and they should let the customer handle the water (which should be dripped onto the sugar slowly, again, so that the sugar dissolves properly and the louche develops).  I know it's extremely nit-picky to take issue with this, but if it's the kind of place that takes pride in serving absinthe, they should do it right.\\n\\nOn to the food.  The food pretty much knocked our socks off.  We shared the Charcuterie to start (very fancy-pants picnic food), and for our entr√©es we had the pumpkin gnocchi tossed in a hazelnut butter reduction and the boar bourguignon.

I have been there for dinner with friends, a couple of times by myself for both Saturday and Sunday brunch sitting at the bar. I went there with my husband this morning for Sunday brunch (11/12/17) at about 11 a.m. and the host asked if we had reservations. Since we did not, she explained we would have to eat at one of the communal tables with high top stools (bar seating was full). I was little skeptical, the dining room was only half sat and I've never seen a full dining room from the times I had been there before. But I didn't think about it too hard. We sat, ordered coffee and discussed the menu. I noticed two woman sitting at one of the communal tables behind us and one of them was doing something on her phone. Our server arrived with our coffee and two mixed drinks and she said she would be back to take our order. The other two drinks were for the two women at the other table. The woman asked the host if her table was ready. The host looked confused and the woman said, \\"I made a reservation online, it's for ****NAME.\\" Wow. Seriously? Booked a table while waiting for drinks? Yep, they got seated at a table in the dining area. Then we drank some of our coffee. What did they serve us? It's cold and horribly bitter. We had enough and walked out. Being lied to about no available seating and being served crap coffee is a little more than I am going to tolerate. And as I was writing this review, I went online and did a reservation for two for 1 p.m. and it was available. If there are issues with seating due to the kitchen being short staffed, then say that.

Aside from the occasional missed miso soup order, things generally arrive just as ordered and tasting great. So far, these guys have the second freshest raw salmon and avocado I've had in Portland. Also, if you show up with a group, get the Sansai Boat!

The large flat screen TV on the far wall is always showing super depressing political news programs, so I avoid that side. Lastly, on one visit the miso soup was bad, which they quickly fixed, and one time the fish wasn't so fresh, but was still quite edible. Given how many times I've been, it's a good track record overall.

I've had outstanding and well orchestrated small plate and family style meals before but cynically in this instance it just seemed like an excuse for lazy service.  In my view, the crowded space and rushed atmosphere do not compliment this style of service - customers are crowded into shared counter spaces and tables and there is simply not enough space for multiple plates.  Ostensibly the justification for this service style is the food is the star here and it's at best straight off the line.  As such, seems strange to me this very important food did not come with a new side plate for each course (meaning, it mingled with whatever residual sauce came with the last course). \\n\\nThe service was ok but came with a little too much attitude for me.  Our waitress did a fine enough job but I felt like it all came with a slightly condescending and fake attitude.  Bussers rushed to clear our plates to keep up with new orders.  Unfortunately, this rushed us and left us without time to finish each course. \\n\\nAnd as for that very important food?  A roast apple with lardons and cheddar was good but seemed greasy and didn't blow me away.  The biscuit in the chicken and venison gravy was flaky and delicious but I've had equally good biscuits and gravy all over town.  Finally, I found the sausage and egg ragu underwhelming - it was homey and tasted good enough but I did not find it to be particularly complex or special.\\n\\nBottom line - it's not that the food wasn't good.

The pulled pork had a good taste, but the taste wasn't that different from any other pulled pork I have had elsewhere.  The negative part: it was floating in a pool of grease.

I'm going with 'Yes' on this one.\\n\\nWhen I moved here, I was under the impression that I must submerse myself in Boston's city proper to find perfectly blended cocktails paired with a mouthwatering and carefully orchestrated food menu. The truth is- one needn't look much further than Somerville.\\n\\nThis tiny restaurant nestled in an unassuming location amidst storefronts (that to this day, after hundreds of visit, I cannot recall their names or their trade) hosts some of the most delicious drinks I have ever had- and I've had A LOT of drinks in my day (we're of course going to overlook the countless cases of Keystone Light I consumed in college). In fact, I have a blog dedicated to the seemingly endless pursuit of the perfect margarita and I must say that the Highland Kitchen #27 may prove to be the Holy Grail. It is the perfect marriage of tequila (NOT Cuervo- c'mon people, you can't still think that Cuervo is tequila??) fresh squeezed lime juice, and all natural agave nectar in place of an artificial tasting sour mix. Finally, a splash of orange bitters tops the whole thing off to create a cocktail that is sure to induce instant addiction. I've been trying to convince the bartender to create an IV drip for me, no headway on that yet but I'm hopeful.\\n\\nSince a lot of these reviews do a great job covering what's good and what's bad- here's something things you may not know:\\n\\n1-There is what I like to call the \\"Highland Kitchen Window\\". This is the period of time in which you should aim to arrive at the restaurant that will allow little to no wait time. For Brunch- show up at 10:45. You will wait in a fairly small line for the doors to open, but once they do you will get seated immediately. You will notice that the big rush comes shortly after opening. Lucky you! Feel free to shoot an evil smile to those waiting between bites of your delicious, fluffy beignets. \\n\\nOn weekdays, the window is between 5pm and 6:45pm and on weekends I find that getting there anytime after opening seems to lead to a wait, however, if you arrive before 6:30 you may at least have room to sit or stand at the bar while you wait for your table.\\n\\n2- There is a parking lot in back of the restaurant off of Central St. It's very small, however if you arrive at this lot and there is a parking spot- congratulations! Chances are you have made the \\"Highland Kitchen Window\\". \\n\\n3- Come for the specials. Their regular menu is unreal- we all know that, but their selection of rotating specials are enough to keep me coming back week after week to discover what new tastes they have created.\\n\\n4- Their menu changes seasonally, so make sure to return! Ok, that's dumb I KNOW you're going back to Highland no matter what but they do have new dishes depending on what's in season. I'm hoping that their crispy pork belly appetizer comes back around! \\n\\n5- The Highland Kitchen Raw bar is dope. Because of the overwhelming allure of the rest of their menu, I feel that a lot of people overlook the raw selection. These are truly some wonderfully simply oysters: Pure, unadulterated, fresh and delicious. In fact, some nights they run out so get your hands on these folks!\\n\\n6- Don't go for your typical cape-codder, screwdriver same ole' boring bar drinks here. In fact, they don't even have jager (which I find discourages dude-bros with blown out haircuts and Affliction T-shirts from flocking here- thank you Highland). They have a beautiful selection of Bourbons, Whiskey and even exotic bitters. If you're torn- ask one of the very knowledgeable bartenders what they recommended. These are true professionals. Oh and seriously, the #27....\\n\\nI feel that I need a 7th bullet point so that I may conclude this by saying that I've created the 7 commandments of Highland Kitchen so I'll close with this: \\n7- Next time you go to Highland Kitchen, take me with you.\\n\\nSo there you have it- the 7 Highland Kitchen Commandments.

Upon entering, my friend asked the host if the lunch buffet was still open, and we were told that it was.  The host told us that the chef had just left on a 15 min break and that we could have the buffet or wait until he came back to order from the regular menu.   I asked to see the menu anyway and shortly thereafter he went outside and said that the chef was not coming back.   The sign outside said the lunch buffet was $11.99 and dinner buffet $15.99 with no distinction between weekday and weekend.   My two friends had the buffet and the host eventually agreed to make me a chicken wrap.\\n\\nI am told the buffet was good, especially the salad and potatoes.  My wrap was fresh if a little bland - I had asked for medium hotness but it was not spicy whatsoever.  The ingredients were fresh though.  The host brought us some water when requested.\\n\\nThe reason for the low rating is this : \\nWhen it came time to pay, we went up to the counter and a different person rang up our charges separately.  They were charged $15.99 each for the buffet - and the cashier apologized for any confusion that the host may have caused as he was new.  I told him we were under the impression that it would be the lunch buffet price, but apparently that is not in effect on weekends.  Again, this is not stated on the sign outside - deceptive if you ask me.  Had we known this, we would most certainly have gone somewhere else.  The cashier still had the opportunity to follow through on the lower price, but chose instead to say sorry and charge the higher price anyway."},{"name":"Zippity Do Dog","address":"160 Speen St","city":"Framingham","stars":"4","text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the hot dogs and friendly staff.

Apparently there are a number of diehard fans that swear fealty to the institution, eagerly awaiting their new seasonal flavors and finding any excuse to drop by one of their locations.  I knew then that I had to be part of that crazy.\\n\\nWe stopped by before leaving for Seattle.  After exchanging pleasantries with our server (who was very accommodating and patient as we chose) we tackled the variety of flavors that Salt & Straw had to offer.  And there are a lot.  Coffee & bourbon, carrot cake, olive oil,  just to name a few.  Several sample spoons later, it was hard not to get caught up in the numerous sugary-sweet offerings.\\n\\nI ultimately chose the coconut strawberry rhubarb pie.  This particular flavor had coconut ice cream with bits of strawberry rhubarb pie in it.  The two tastes mingled well, the subtleness of the coconut was a great undertone to the sweetness of the pie bites.  My traveling buddy went with the pear & blue cheese.  Being partial to pear, I can vouch for it.  The blue cheese gives it a nice little kick.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a visit if you want to try something not typical of most ice cream parlors."},{"name":"Five Guys Burgers and Fries","address":"558 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my first Five Guys expereince.

Nino's came highly recommended by the Yelp nation, so we figured, why not?  When we pulled up the parking lot was nearly empty (this says a lot in my mind), but we were committed at that point.  The building is nothing fancy to look at.  Inside is so dimly lit that we could barely see, so we went to the enclosed patio which was very nice.  And this is where they began working their magic.  Service was superb.  Our waiter interacted with our children, calling them by name.  The menu was difficult for the kids to read, but we helped them understand what was what.  The food... amazing!

This place is well worthy of it.  We have been twice and are planning to go back which says something in itself due to the fact it's in a part of Somerville you would probably only go to if you lived within walking distance.  Now you have a reason to visit Teele Sq!  This is my favorite Somerville SQ thanks to this special Turkish spot.  \\n\\nAs others have noted, the red pepper dip is mind blowing!  My mind was so blown last time I was there I forgot to ask if I can purchase a large jar of it to bring home.  It's seriously that great.  When I get home from this place I have withdrawals from not having that dip nearby.  Their fresh home made bread is a perfect compliment to the dip.  We haven't even spent any money yet and we're already at 5 stars! The food can best be described as Turkish comfort food.  It doesn't go out of bounds with flavors, it's safe and delicious.  The kofte plate was my favorite entree on our first visit.  This plate had so many items of food that worked very well together.  I had lamb on my first visit and was disappointed compared to the rest of the food as it was a little gamey (it is lamb).  It just didn't compare to everything else we've had here.  Second visit we shared several tapas and enjoyed them all greatly.  Our favorites were the patates kofte (think loaded potato), sigara borek (dough filled with cheese and egg yolk mix, delicious!), Leyla  Ile Mencun (hummus with sausage cooked in butter), Bebek Karni Yarik (eggplant stuffed with ground meat).

I love the small plates idea and love that everything is fairly priced.  We visited on the third day of its official opening, which meant they didn't have their liquor license, but I believe they have it now.

Bar was rocking and ambiance was cool. After about 45 minutes, we were seated. I did not care for our booth, bc we were right by the door. Everytime someone opened it, the cold air blew in. They should do something about that (like at Neptune Oyster). \\n\\nFrom the apps section, we tried fried dates wrapped in bacon with nuts. I mean c'mon. Who wouldn't like these things?

Tasted as advertised. Chopped lamp in a soft taco shell. Not bad. \\n\\nFor the main course, my gf had the Cuban ruben. It is basically the best part of both sandwiches. It had the corned beef and russian dressing of the ruben, and it had the pork that you would find on a Cuban sandwich. To top it off, you were given the option of crawt or slaw. She chose the slaw. I thought it was great. She just thought it was ok. I was surprised she just said ok. It was really good. I went with the fish and chips. Holy large plate batman. It was huge.

I chose not to have the meal re-cooked properly.\\n\\nThe waitress than took my meal to the owner who inspected my meal and then from the kitchen (he didn't even bother to come to our table) he let me know that I should have ordered it well done.  I had made every effort to make sure the meat would be cooked well done.  If there is a specific doneness that the meat is cooked to the waitress should have informed me like she did with my husband's steak.  And if they are going to serve rare loose ground beef to the general public (including the elderly, pregnant and very young)  they should indicate that on their menu as to prevent illness.  \\n\\nI guarantee if I was to order a burger there they would ask me how I would like it cooked.  In fact I have ordered the burger there and I was asked how I would like it cooked.  And just on the side it was extremely salty.  I love salt but this was too much.\\n\\nI also don't believe the health department would approve of serving loose rare ground beef.\\n\\nI wish the matter would have been handled differently.  I wish the waitress and the owner would have just agreed to cook the meat through rather than defending the dish and suggesting that I did not order properly.\\n\\nSadly, I will not be back to Toast."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"6130 Roswell Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"I come here every so often.

I went in at 12:36 p.m. with much excitement to try the doubles. Upon ordering the doubles, I was informed that there was not any. To my dismay, I ordered the chicken curry and roti. Again, I was informed that there was also no roti and/or chicken curry. I then asked, \\"What do you have then?\\" He stated that there was only curry goat and curry shrimp but no roti to go with it, just rice. I ordered absolutely nothing and thanked him for his time. There wasn't even any kind of attempt for customer recovery or incentive for returning seeing that 90% of the menu was unavailable. This was such a total waste of my time and gas!! The hours clearly state that they are open from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. on Mondays, and I don't think that coming in at 12:36 p.m. was late!! If you are gonna open for lunch, especially in a location that is noted for such a high volume of customers during lunch, you should be able to stock up appropriately or at least have a chef available. It is evident that the food is pre-cooked and is warmed up in a microwave as customers order, so when it runs out, or if there are issues with the chef, certain menu items will not be available on those days; thus resulting in the situation I was in today. Words cannot express how disappointed I am in this establishment!! First impressions are so important and leaves a lasting imprint.

One of the girls noticed that I was taking quite awhile looking up at their menu board so she asked if there was anything in particular I was looking for.  I explained that I was hoping they would have a combination plate with teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu together.  They had lots of different combinations but not with those two items that I was looking for.  She immediately said that she would make up such a combo for me. . .no problem at all.  I was pleased they were able to accommodate me and make me exactly what I wanted even though it wasn't on the menu.  Great service!  Well, the serving of food was HUGE.  I got the two kinds of chicken, white rice, and a salad with poppy seed dressing.  There were two separate little containers of sauce: one with teriyaki sauce and the other was sauce for the katsu.  The chicken was a bit too chewy for my tastes, but not bad.  Also their teriyaki sauce was the thin, watery type that just ran straight to the bottom of the plate.

When our two-person party walked up to the hostess, we were told there was a 30 minute wait, in spite of the fact that there were numerous tables open and no one else waiting. We were told we could sit at the bar if we could find seats. \\n\\nUnsurprisingly there were no open seats at the bar, so we took a lap of EAV to kill some time. We figured maybe we could go back and ask if we could just order drinks at the bar, sit at an empty table, and wait until we could be officially \\"seated\\" and met with our server. Even then we were told they were taking a 30 minute break from seating tables because the kitchen was backed up, and that was only after some pushing to get any source of information. The hostess was not very forthcoming, and didn't seem interested in trying to explain the situation in a way that would make us want to stay. \\n\\nMy service at Holy Taco has always been excellent, as has the food. On my last trip there, even though the kitchen was again backed up, our waiter was super friendly and attentive, and took excellent care of us and kept us updated on the kitchen's progress. \\n\\nI'm giving 3/5 stars because up to now, my experience at Holy Taco has been grand, and I think the food is reliably delicious; but tonight, the service was really disappointing. The fact that no attempts were made to explain why we couldn't be seated, and only after several awkward questions were we given anything resembling a reasonable explanation as to why we couldn't sit down in a half-empty restaurant, has put a really bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\nHere's hoping that this was a blip, and my next experience will be back to normal - but after tonight, I'm not sure how soon I'll be returning to Holy Taco."},{"name":"Trend Pure Asian Cuisine","address":"1400 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"Rarely do I post a review.

When I got it home, I saw that it was basically burned. It was a lot more salty than it had been in the past. I have always put up with them running out of chicken, or having to wait for things because the food, at the end of the day, was good.  But this time, the flavor was totally off from what it is been in my past trips.  Also, the chicken meat itself had a weird musty taste/odor to it. \\n\\nAlso, I tried to order a whole chicken (eight pieces). They only had legs and thighs. At most any other chicken establishment that I have ever been to, they will substitute with no issue, especially when the available chicken is that of a cheaper variety.  As I have had to do before, I had to plead my case to not be charged individually for each piece of chicken, which would've made my total of seven dollars more.  I was successful this time, because the the ladies at the cash register were nice.  Understandable to run out of chicken, there is no perfect way to predict when you might run out of a certain piece of chicken. However, I do not understand the line of thinking to charge a customer more when the establishment is at fault for not having supplies there. Particularly, when the customer is settling for a lesser product.  \\n\\nI hope this establishment can return to its original level of quality.

Then the previous group had a large party that left the restaurant, but then stood around chatting for a while right in front of the door.  I wanted to say, \\"You know we're all waiting for you to get out of the way, right?\\"  But they moved on and I decided I was not waiting outside any longer, so I did my best to stay out of the way in the tiny space by the door while they cleaned and reset the tables.\\n\\nThey have communal-style seating and we enjoyed talking to the couple across from us.\\n\\nPossibly my favorite course was the first - which I wouldn't have guessed going into it - the watercress and sorrel soup with duck fat croutons.  YUM.  Duck fat must be a wonderful addition to a lot of things.\\n\\nThe charcuterie plate was a lot of fun.  I can't say I've ever had a foie gras bon bon before!  And it was delicious.  I also loved the steak tartare.  I regret not taking a picture of this plate, but my husband always rolls his eyes when I do this.\\n\\nThe third course was a ribeye, cooked perfectly over double whipped potatoes with chive sauce bordelaise.  Again, I was surprised that my favorite thing on the plate were the crispy brussels sprouts.  So simple, but so good!\\n\\nThe radicchio and pear salad worried me because I find radicchio to be very bitter.  But the pear, fried prosciutto and browned butter vinaigrette balanced the radicchio.  I could have drank that vinaigrette.  YUM!\\n\\nLoved the cheese course with honey as always, but the toasted marcona almonds were amazing!  My husband is allergic to almonds so I got his too - bonus!\\n\\nThe final course of chocolate torte was very rich and delicious - the stand out for me was the salted caramel ice cream that went with it.  \\n\\nThe service was very attentive and not pretentious.  They explain what is on each plate as they serve it which could be reconfirming for knowledgeable diners or provide some more explanation to people who don't do a lot of fine dining.\\n\\nMy only complaint is they have got to have the most uncomfortable chairs of any restaurant I have ever been to!  I couldn't cross my legs under the table.  When my calves started shaking, I realized I had been up on my toes (so my back wouldn't be in such a weird alignment).

I was quick to order a whiskey flight, which they have 3 different types of at a cost of $15. For food I went w/ the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. For my sides I chose fries, Texas toast and spicy coleslaw. I wanted to have the hot links, but they were out. So call ahead to see if they have what you want so you're not a sad panda when they tell you they're out. \\n\\nThe whiskey came out relatively quickly and the joy on my face was that of a little kid getting a treat. I wish the portions were a bit more generous though. When the food came out I thought the same thing when it came to portions, could've been a bit more. Side note, the pulled pork comes on top a slice of Texas toast. The side of Texas toast is buttered, while the piece that comes w/ the pulled pork is not. The ribs were petty good. The brisket was half meat and half fat. The pulled pork was actually dry. Luckily they have 3 sauces to choose from. A sweet, a spicy and grey poupon type. The fries were my favorite of the meal because they were hot and had lots of flavor. That was a bummer to realize that out of the 6 items I ordered, the fries had the best taste and flavor. The meal came w/ a slice of watermelon. I've never seen that at a bbq place before or any restaurant come to think of it.\\n\\n After I finished my meal I kept thinking of two things, the fries and what the hot links tasted link and if they would've been the game changer for me."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"4400 Ashford-Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3005","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I visit Cheesecake Factory when I don't want a surprise in my meal.  It's also a safe bet when meeting picky friends for lunch/dinner because CF has something for everyone.  If a person can't find something to eat at CF, they probably have a personality disorder.  (This makes it a great first date place!)\\n\\nThey stopped serving my favorite snack - buffalo chicken meatballs.  They were so delicious and a perfect appetizer size.  I hate that they no longer carry them.  That being said, I console myself with the fresh kale salad and sausage and ricotta flatbread.  My favorite cheesecake is the key lime (... but I also like pumpkin when it's in season.)  I used to avoid CF because their portion sizes were so large but now with their small plate options, it's a much more reasonable place to consider for lunch or dinner.  \\n\\nI'm writing this review because I think people sleep on the good cocktails that are made at CF.  If you work in the area, the CF bar is a great place for happy hour.  The drink sizes are generous, suitably potent and worth their price point.  My favorites are the Mai Tai and J.W.'s Lemonade. You're not drinking a \\"crafted cocktail\\" but you're drinking a well-made cocktail and that's okay too.\\n\\nI usually sit at the bar here and service is okay.

I'm typically willing to pay $12-$14 for a good chopped salad.  But i don't care how fresh or tasty your veggies are if the service is terrible.  And the last 2x i've been there, it's been ridiculously bad.  Like \\"Am I on Punked right now?\\" bad.  Both times a friend and I ordered online (separately) and 30 min later, i went to pick up our food.  The first time i arrived and went to the \\"pick up\\" counter, but had to wait until three others (including one person who walked in after me) ordered and had their salads made.  So it took about 10 minutes of me standing there before anyone would hand me my already paid for food.  No one said \\"Hi! We'll be with you in just a sec.\\"  No one acknowledged me at all.  In addition, they forgot one item of our order.  Tonight i decided to give it another try, but the moment I walked in I knew it was gonna be the same thing--but i was wrong.  It was way worse.  There were two people waiting in line at the register to buy sodas.  I was behind them, and there were two people who walked in right after me.  There were four people making salads, but no one on the register.  Again i stood there, this time for 15 min, waiting to be helped.  None of us waiting were acknowledged.  What is the point of ordering ahead only to have to stand there and wait in line?  After 15 min, someone finally came to the register to help us.  But--they didn't make my salads yet.  In fact i was told the order(s) hadn't \\"popped up until right now\\".  So we had ordered 45 minutes ago and i still had to wait while they made my salads.  I wasn't even offered a glass of water while i waited--just a weak \\"sorry about that\\".  While my salads were being made, i chatted with the two people who were in line behind me (and now were waiting again since the register gal was making my salads and again no one was helping those in line).  One guy was dining-in with his wife, who had already gotten her food and had completely finished it, plus a glass of wine, and the dude's salad still hadn't come out.  He told the staff \\"My wife is done eating and ready to go.  Either you comp the salad and make it to-go, or I just don't want it\\".  He had been waiting over 20 min while she ate.  They declined to comp his salad, so he and his wife left.  He told me that they're never coming back, that it's \\"always like this\\".  The next lady had placed an online order and--you guessed it--the salads weren't made/the order \\"wasn't received until just now\\".  If you're going to accommodate online orders, then for the love of kale, you gotta have someone check the computer for the orders!  Other suggestions:  hire a dedicated register person and train your staff to acknowledge the customers waiting.  Oh and comp items when you mess up.  Also, i've eaten there 6 times now and have signed up for the super complicated \\"loyalty program\\"--i have received no points or credits for those 6 visits.  Why so complicated?   This place has the potential to be great if the owner accepts the feedback of her customers and makes some changes.

The perfect balance IMHO.  \\n\\nThe seating:  Different. A large section is community table.  Love it.  Very European.  But, it also means you might sit next to people you wouldn't have chosen.  But go open minded (probably not a romantic dinner unless it's your 'thing') and it makes for a good time.  Meanwhile, there's plenty of tables for a pair or a 4 top.

Just gotta find the items you like most.  \\nWe tried:  \\nThe Kimchi sampler and it was actually pretty good.  The only part:  What to eat it with?  It's just Kimchi.

Yes, I love them.  and will get them again.  Easy to eat, drumstick style. and I didn't need any sauce.  They were perfect.   A bit on the salty side, but hey, I've always liked my crispy duck salty. \\n\\nThe cheese plate:  Pretty good actually.  Nothing too extravagant on there.  This plate would do well for most anyone, except maybe a cheese snob.  Mostly cow and 1 goat.  But enjoyable.  Will get again.\\n\\nThe Squid Fries:  YUM!  We really loved these.  the batter was perfect and the seasoning was great.  Another favorite.\\n\\nThe Venison Kabob:  Hmmm, not so much.  most of the pieces were the perfect texture and flavor.  Not gamey at all.  But I did have a piece that still had the chewy 'skin/ tendon' (forgot what it's called, it's the clearish layer on venison) still on it.  No biggie, but gave the impression that the person prepping in the back maybe doesn't know better or missed that one?  The ONLY bit about this dish that should be stated LOUDLY:  It comes between rare and medium rare in it's preparation.  It's seared only and the inside is still very red (uncooked) and the customers next to us, their's was still bloody.  Not bad, just be prepared for a tartar kind of experience with this one.\\n\\nDrinks:  I had their version of Mexican Martini and it was SOOO GOOD!  I hate it when alcohol tastes so yummy.

I thought their portions were tiny for dinner, but it's nothing compared to lunch.  6 slices of meat.  A sparse offering of veggies.  For example, one tiny nappa leaf.  ONE.  This is literally the cheapest thing you could offer, how stingy could you be.  Even the corn, on both combination platters, were the ends.  I understand lunch is cheaper, but you can't be this stingy to your customers, especially when priced at $10.50, a slight premium to their competitors that pay higher rent in Boston.  The experience left a pretty bad taste in my mouth when I left - personally, I'll be sticking to my favorite place, Shabu Kaze, from now on.

With Ormsby's being a very short walk away, these two places can make for a pretty good night out.\\n\\nIf you haven't been here before and you plan on driving instead of using Uber, Lyft, etc., you best bet for parking will be in the big parking or garage near Taqueria Del Sol and Jeni's Ice Cream.

The atmosphere is pretty cool as its dimly lit, but the lighting they got going is unique. I got here on a early Friday evening and was pleasantly surprised to learn that happy hour was still going. It's from 5-7 pm on weekdays and there a couple of cocktails available for $5. I went with a cocktail made of Sapporo, soju, and limoncello. It wasn't bad, and I'd probably get it again, especially for five bucks. There are a number of alcohol options available with many of the cocktails ranging from 10-11 bucks, as well as sake, beer, and wine options.\\n\\nIf you're hungry, there are a number of food options available. I ended up going with the:\\n\\n- Pork Dumplings (5 in one order)\\n- Wings (6 in one order)\\n- Fried Calamari\\n- Pork Belly Bun\\n\\nI definitely would recommend getting the pork dumplings and the calamari.

My colleague and I were the only people in the place.\\n\\nAfter discussing veggie options with the server I asked for a house salad and the gnocchi then inquired if they had marinated olives. She told me that I could forgo the salad and go with an appetizer that had greens and olives, so I thought that would be perfect.\\n\\nImmediately, before we even had a chance to sip our wine she delivered a plate of greens and olives, but guess what else? It was loaded with salami! Really? Didn't we just go though the entire menu together discussing veggie options!?\\n\\nShe said, \\"oh, sorry, I wasn't thinking\\" and came back 5 seconds later with a plate sans the meat, as if that fooled me.

However there are Korean/Mexican fusion places popping up all over Atlanta, so I'm basing my review  off of this restaurant's performance in comparison to others. The food excites you, but the flavor is not quite there with the tacos, which I tried three of. First off, shredded cheese is probably not necessary on Korean tacos, but rather some sort of aioili or something else to add to the flavor. The tacos are definitely filling, but if they get the flavor/filling right then this place will bomb the competition, especially because of their prices. I also tried the dumplings which were great, but dumplings are hard to mess up. Bottom line, if this place is called K BBQ Taco then the taco should be spectacular.

I ordered a Hendricks martini with a twist which consists of: gin, vermouth, and lemon peel.  When I received the bill it read $6 for gin, $3 for a Hendricks up sell, and an additional $1 for a martini up sell.  When I questioned the waiter about the martini up sell and whether the extra buck was for more alcohol, he told me no, but that the extra charge was to mix a martini.  When I asked if I'd be charged that dollar had I requested the drink on the rocks he said no, unless it was in a martini glass.  \\n\\nI don't mind the price, so much as the attitude.  Charging extra for a martini cocktail is like charging extra for paper throw away floor mats when getting an oil change.  I don't set your prices, and I don't even think the prices are outrageous.  But the least you can do is adequately answer a patron's questions.  There's hardly a cocktail more simple than a martini.

The restaurant is on the ground level of the Brookwood highrise condominium building. The south side of the building houses Saltyard and the north side Watershed on Peachtree. Both restaurants share the same parking garage and complimentary valet service, which can be accessed via either side of the building. Saltyard's front door actually faces Palisades Rd. NE.\\n\\nSaltyard was opened by the owners of the old school Buckhead Italian restaurant La Grotta.  The chef, Nick Leahy, previously worked at restaurants such as Two Urban Licks and Parish.  The name of the restaurant is based on the historical significance of salt as a valuable commodity and a token of generosity and friendship.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a clean and open design with tall windows and a spacious patio.  The patio is located on Peachtree and is decorated with string lighting.  The look and feel of the interior is both modern and rustic.  The bar and dining areas are outfitted with traditional wooden dining tables and stools.  The counter at the open kitchen and the bar are lit with retro/industrial light fixtures.  Long dark drapes are attached to the wooden support/accent beams, making it easy for the restaurant to cordon off spaces for private parties and special events, which they seem to host a lot of.\\n\\nSince this is a tapas restaurant, the best way to enjoy it is to order a lot of dishes and share.  The menu offers a variety of cuisines from cheese and charcuterie to salads, seafood, pasta, and full-fledged meat entrees.  The small plates typically range in price from $6-11 each and the bigger plates around $20 each.\\n\\nThe menu is seasonal and subject to change.  Many ingredients are sourced from local farms and food purveyors.  The ingredients are fresh and good quality.  On weeknights from 5-7pm, they offer $1 oysters.  On Tuesday nights, there's a $15 burger and beer special.  Among other things, the double-stack burger includes truffle mayo and a Holeman & Finch bun.\\n\\nA couple of dishes the restaurant is known for are the \\"fork-tender\\" duck confit with beluga lentils, celery salad, and poultry jus and the \\"blistered\\" green beans with bacon and ginger, cooked in a cider reduction.  Also popular are the salmon \\"poke\\" tacos with sesame aioli and roe (fish eggs) and the house-cured salmon chips.  Poke is a Hawaiian-style salad, typically made with fish.  Three tacos come with each order.\\n\\nThe raw oysters on the half shell are good.  They come in varying sizes, presumably dependent on where the latest batch is from.  I'm not sure where they source the oysters from.  They come with cocktail sauce and a tasty housemade mignonette.\\n\\nA good salad to get is the local Bibb salad.  It comes with radicchio, grilled eggplant, roasted red bell pepper, almonds, and a heavy mustard vinaigrette.  It's crisp and refreshing.\\n\\nThe grilled octopus is served in salad form, tossed with plenty of arugula.  It comes with small bits of roasted potato, red onion, and a generous helping of cilantro.  Some bites of octopus are better (less \\"fishy\\") than others.\\n\\nThe deviled farm eggs are great.  They are served in a small, double-handle, cast iron skillet (a lot of dishes here are actually served in this style skillet).  It's made with pickle, bacon, and Sriracha sauce.  However, the eggs are not spicy.  Two eggs or four egg halves are served with each order.  I recommend this one.\\n\\nThe smoked pork empanada is filling.  One large empanada comes with each order.  The empanada is densely packed with hearty, shredded pork.  It's placed over a persimmon BBQ sauce and a few thin slices of pickle.\\n\\nThe stuffed piquillo peppers is a surprisingly sweet dish.  Piquillo peppers are not spicy peppers, but sweet red peppers.  They are filled with chevre (French for goat cheese) and are served atop honey.  If you like goat cheese, this is good stuff.\\n\\nQuite possibly my favorite dish is the burrata over butternut squash cooked with sorghum, pecans, and brown butter.  Burrata is fresh, full-flavored mozzarella mixed with cream.  It looks like a poached egg, but it's a super soft, delicate, melt-in-your-mouth mozzarella.  It tastes light and is extremely satisfying.  The sorghum-sweetened butternut squash and other ingredients are just icing on the proverbial cake.  You should order this dish.\\n\\nOn the flipside, I'm not a fan of the roasted butternut squash.  It comes with curried Greek yogurt, green olives, and pepitas (Spanish for pumpkin seeds).  Also served in a black skillet, this dish is simply too salty.  Part of the reason is the olives.  The squash is chopped into tiny pieces.  After roasting, the exterior texture of the squash becomes quite crispy.\\n\\nThe pistachio semifreddo (Italian ice cream) is not a bad dessert.  It has real bits of pistachio and cranberry inside, all topped with a rich chocolate sauce.\\n\\nGood service."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here on a rainy Saturday and didn't have to wait in a line at all!!!

It's so easy to over do it when ordering dim sum, especially when food is prepared to order and not carted over to you.

The ambiance is great, but the star of the show was the food. Between the two of us, we ordered a started of roasted peppers and an order of the brussels. For dinner the idea is family style eating, which we enjoyed. For our main course, however, we opted to choose our own dish because I am a vegetarian and my date was not. I ordered one of the specials, a risotto dish that was fantastic! It tasted almost like toffee, which sounds odd but really was very enjoyable. Although they are share plates which was usually smaller, we were quite full after this main course. We wanted to try a dessert, though, so we opted to share the \\"nanner pudding.\\" The dessert was the least impressive dish of the night, although it was still tasty. \\n\\nOne other interesting thing was the ice ball cocktails. All the ingredients except the liquor are frozen into a ball. From there the liquor is poured over, which melts the ice ball. So, if you drink it quickly, you are getting straight liquor but if you let it sit, you start to get the full effect of the drink. The taste changed with each sip. Also, downstairs from Swift's Attic is a jazz club. It fills up fast, so I wouldn't recommend getting there too late, but it was a nice treat after dinner.

I love Ohio and, therefore, I love things that come from Ohio but I just don't love Bob's restaurant.\\n\\nThis particular Bob's looks just like the rest with its overly polished ex- and interior making it seem like someone spent way too much money for a country feel. I have certainly never been to a true country restaurant that looked anything like it. The staff, of course, was a hodgepodge of high schoolers, 20 year olds, and 50 year olds. They were nice enough if not particularly country or professional. \\n\\nMy food? I got what I think was called the Farmers Choice Breakfast. It came with 2 eggs, hashbrowns, choice of meat, and choice of 2 hotcakes, 1 crepe, or 2 slices of French toast. I ordered my eggs over medium because I don't like the white part runny but they came out fully cooked; almost like flat hard boiled eggs. The hashbrowns were just ok, not really good or bad. The Sausage links were great, just as they always are. If Bob knows one thing it is Sausage (he has yet to come out of the closet). I chose the hotcakes, poor choice, and was rewarded with some terribly, overly sweet cooked batter that tasted like cheap mix from the grocery store.

First visit we fell in love but we were kind of put off by the lack of people at lunch time on a Saturday and so my curiosity got the best of me and I yelped it.  Lots of mixed revues - so we gave it the second try, I am so happy we did.  Second visit and the place was pleasantly full - the sushi was OMG good and of course plentiful too say the least.  You have to order what you want - but they just keep it coming as long as you order.  Quality - A, Taste - A, variety for lunch (at an AMAZING price)AAA and I would have to say the service is an A as well.
