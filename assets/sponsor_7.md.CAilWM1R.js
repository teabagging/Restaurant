Was fairly full but there were a few tables open so was lucky to be seated right away. The server took the order and we got the Southwest Flatbread to start.\\n\\nThe Southwest Flatbread came out in a reasonable time. It has chicken, bacon, and topped off with delicious sauces. Everything goes well with one another. Definitely recommended IF you do come here.\\n\\nFor my main, I had the steak and veggies. I substituted the veggies for cactus cut potatoes. And this is where it starts to go downhill.\\n\\nThe steak is a 7oz New York strip loin. I had it medium rare and it was pink inside (y). However for some reason it was very bland. Had little to no taste at all. Even if it had some charring on the outside would had helped it greatly. I know it's questionable for someone to eat steak at a pizza\\nplace and after all it's $17, but still. \\n\\nThe cactus cut potatoes was a mistake. It too was bland. But worse it was quite tough and the texture felt very stale. Kind of like when you are at a Chinese restaurant and you have crispy chicken with the coloured chips.. And the chips aren't fresh. It was like that or eating cardboard.\\n\\nThe mashed potatoes were okay. Nothing to rave about here.\\n\\nAfter \\"finishing\\" the main, decided to have dessert. Took a little while to flag down the server to order the chocolate brownie which comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. \\n\\nThen an even greater wait began. It probably took at least 10 to 15 minutes before the dessert came out. Not sure if this is normal for the dessert to take so long. I personally felt it was unreasonable.\\n\\nAnyway when the dessert finally came, we asked for the bill right away since the dessert took forever to arrive. It seemed like it was a difficult night to get a hold of anyone. It was during the dinner rush, but I did not feel it was chaotic. There was no sense of urgency. \\n\\nI must admit the brownie was warm when it finally arrived. Perhaps they make/bake it to order and hence the lengthy wait? The ice cream is really good, but the brownie is very sweet. Overall it is a good dessert, but absolutely not worth the 10 to 15 minute wait.\\n\\nWe finish what we can with the dessert and tried to find our server or anyone so we can pay and get the heck out. You would think since we asked for the bill right when we got the dessert it would suggest we are ready to pay asap. Nope not tonight. After a good five minutes go by, I gave up and decided to go right up to pay. Found our server on the side. She was chatting with another server. \\n\\nOverall it was quite the negative experience for me. My main course was subpar. The starter and dessert were above average. But the real kicker was the service. It's not that the staff or our server was rude, but the service was non existent when we actually needed it. Like when we wanted a dessert menu to order more food, or to pay for our meal. Oh and did I mention the lengthy wait for dessert? I was actually kind of struggling to decide if this will be a 1 or 2 star rating. The ambiance is actually not bad and the decor looks nice inside. Looks-wise, it would be a decent place to watch the game or have drinks. But usually when I am stuck on a rating it comes down to service."},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The service was pleasant and the dollar value was good.

Why I like this place, it's good and very affordable. 7 bucks get you a burger and a side. While that's nothing to write home about, I think the quality of what you get is amazing for the price you're getting. \\n\\nTried two different burgers: Seoul burger and the aloha burger with sweet potato fries and lotus chips. \\n\\nBoth burgers were cooked to medium. Slightly pink on the inside, which I love. I hate well done meats, I think it ruins everything, whereas this leaves the burger still juicy. The Seoul burger was good, I liked the aloha burger better. I liked how the arugula gave the seoul burger a contrast in texture and taste, and that ssam sauce, what's in it? I like that slight kick that it has. The aloha burger on the other hand, I thought was amazing. I personally like pineapples on my burgers, gives it a sweet taste with savory of the meat. If that's not your thing, perfectly ok. I don't judge you. I was told that the buns are the same as the H&F buns, I don't know if that's true or not, but it tastes pretty good. Holds the burger well with a slight chew. \\n\\nAs for sides go, sweet potato fries are more like chunks with a simple syrup. Slight crunch, easily eaten with a fork, tastes like it was baked not fried, not a bad flavor. For the lotus chips, I liked these more than the sweet potato chips. I don't really understand what they are, but I know they're good. Thinly sliced, just a slight salty taste, I just wished I had more of them. They give you a pile but it just looks more than what's really there. \\n\\nInterior is sorta small, I would estimate about 25 people max seating space. I hope you're ok sitting next to someone you don't know because there's no individual table seating. \\n\\nThere's 6 total burger choices, of which is 1 veggie option if you're into that.

The crab cake was the best, with very little filler. Escargot was tender; it was hard to tell what the normal presentation would be like, as we had it on a crouton. The bacon was a fairly tough an fatty hunk of pork belly that didn't appeal to me at all.\\n\\nLobster and shrimp dumpling was very nicely saut√©ed, and the heirloom tomatoes served with burrito cheese were excellent.\\n\\nThe filet mignon we had was very tender, but it lacked the sort of char that would make an otherwise fairly bland cut interesting. At least they hadn't tried to cover it up with sauce to disguise its flavor. The accompanying lobster tail was fairly durable and didn't have much flavor, and my wife's was even tougher. So I don't think I'd order a surf and turf, and would be inclined to order a more flavorful steak such as a strip or porterhouse.\\n\\nThe brussels sprout side dish incorporated bacon, which tasted nice, but because the sprouts had been separated into individual leaves it was fairly dry compared to, say, the succulent ones at Eddie V's.\\n\\nThe lobster mac and cheese used fontina cheese which resulted in a somewhat pasty consistency without a lot of crust, but the lobster was good, however the dish was nowhere near as good as the lobster mac at Capital Grille.\\n\\nThe Wild mushrooms were quite good, with a nice variety of mushrooms, succulent and tasty.\\n\\nBoth the chocolate souffle cake and the buttercake were excellent, with my vote going to the buttercake.\\n\\nA variety of good wines were paired with the meal, and the Del Frisco Cabernet Sauvignon, made by Robert Foley, was a particularly nice choice, a fairly light bodied cab with good fruit.\\n\\nService was superb, very attentive and professional.\\n\\nWe were in a private room, which was great, because the main restaurant, which was packed, was absolutely deafening, and there's no way we could have carried on a conversation there with our tablemates.\\n\\nOn the whole, I'd say it's a good conventioneer steakhouse, but I think locals can find better choices."},{"name":"New China Pearl","address":"288 Mishawum Rd","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"I've gotten food here several times, and each time I've experienced awful indigestion, and just generally felt bad.

So I took a risk and made a reservation for their Mother's Day pre-fixe brunch.  The offerings were plentiful, with an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $19.95.  Admittedly, the bargain pricing made me nervous.  But it was a steal, because the food was wonderful.\\n\\nI selected the Portabello mushroom stuffed with Manchego and shallots, Cornish Hen with cranberry/cornbread stuffing, scallion mashed potatoes, green beans and Madeira sauce, and grilled pineapple with caramel sauce and Vanilla ice cream.  Now I have to say, the Portabello was anemic, about the size of a sandollar, and for some reason, they'd trimmed off the edges.  The flavor was excellent though (if a bit salty), and it was served with a small side-salad perfectly dressed with balsamic.  The entree was a large portion, perfectly seared and tender, beautifully-seasoned.  Like most restaurants, the green beans were a bit underdone (a bit of \\"form\\" over \\"function,\\" if you ask me), but still a great fresh/bright contrast to the dense, creamy stuffing.  The pineapple was a great way to finish the meal; I'd wanted the raisin bread pudding with caramel and sherry sauce when I began, but was way too full by the end.\\n\\nMy mom had the crab/lobster bisque as her appetizer, and loved the creamy (not gooey) texture and the abundence of lobster meat.  She had the suckling pig with gravy, scallion mashed potatoes, and green beans as her entree, and thought it was perfectly seasoned and cooked, though she would've liked some of the crisp skin to be included.  She went for the bread pudding dessert, and while she enjoyed the flavor, wasn't a fan of the custard-style texture.  I tasted it and enjoyed it however.  My mom also had the Spanish wine flight ($7.50), and appreciated the bargain, though neither of us could really distinguish between the brands.

But not a chefs selection as described on the menu. I feel like I could have picked out these basic cheeses/meats at Publix for the same $60 price tag and had bigger portions. The chutney was good but small and so were the other basic condiments, brown mustard, almonds, and olives.

The manager actually told me, when I brought this us, that he wanted me to go and print out the menu from the internet so he could see it and then he would adjust the prices. I would think that he might have a computer there that he would look at instead of making me go all the way home to print it out then come all of the way back with it. Once I finally got back to my house with the food I wasn't impressed at all. The flatbreads are small, the lobster mac and cheese had 2 pieces of lobster in it and was crumpled up in tin foil with stale chips surrounding it in the Styrofoam container. The fry portion was tiny and the other flatbread that we got was overdone with burnt red onions. I gave it another chance but again they couldn't do it.   This is the worst place that I have gone to since I moved to Orlando a few months ago. Whitewood has amazing food and the service is much better.

When we were younger my mom used to buy all the ingredients needed for rolling up your own sushi at home. It was such a treat back then because we'd reserve those DIY sushi nights for special occasions and I remember looking so forward to them. Now that there are sushi restaurants on practically every block of the city it's probably cheaper to just eat-in or take-out, but I still like coming here to pick up the occasional ingredients. Their prices can be a little bit higher than your big box asian grocery stores like T&T, but it's still worth while coming in to see other Japanese items you wouldn't find elsewhere. I do wish they had a better frozen selection though! I like grabbing their pre-packaged sushi when I'm on the go, although the rice definitely hardens up by the next day if you end up with leftovers.

When I got to the restaurant (the first of the group) no one at the hostess stand greeted me. When my friends arrived (5 min before our reservation time), I told the hostess we were there. She told me we needed to wait in the lounge and did not give any indication of how long we would have to wait. When we were in the lounge, I saw another party of 4 seated. In fact, they had arrived after us and also had a reservation. Ten min after our reservation time, one of my friends went up to ask about our table. The hostess said she could take care of us. However, we were not seated for another 10 min. I understand that Sunday brunch is busy and it's not always possible to be seated exactly at the time of your reservation, but the staff at Stephanie's didn't seem particularly apologetic, and we all felt that our age and appearance (my friends are in their 20s) had something to do with it.

This is the restaurant Atlanta has been waiting for. Everything is operated by Ipads and Iphones. \\n\\nStaff- There are not really waiters per say, but there are people who bring you the food and drink once you place your order. If it is your first time, they walk to your booth and go over how to use the Ipad and how to order. Very simple process, and very efficient.  Not too mention the staff are all good looking people, and very nice. \\n\\nAtmosphere- Perfect for a date or a group of friends. They have I think 4 or 5 booths for groups and tables for couples or just friends. The booths are very comfortable and boss like lol. The tables are spaced just right, so you are not too close to the people next to you. On the walls, they have projects of music videos, of all types of genres of music, the music isn't too loud, but just at the right level, where you can hold a good conversation. Great atmosphere, \\n\\nFood/Bar- The bar is huge and plenty of seating. You use an Ipod to order your drink, the bar tender receives your order and if you are paying using a card, you pay via an attachment to the Ipad also pretty cool. I only had a few beers, but my people had mixed drinks and said they were good. I had the buffalo wing pizza, which was really good. Its a personal pan pizza, thats not too big or small but just right. The pizza feels you up, you won't leaved stuffed, but you will be full. Everything also came out in a timely manner. \\n\\n\\nThe best thing about the resturant is the chat application installed within the ipad. Using the Ipad, there is a chat app that customers can log into ( for free) create a guest name, and chat with others in the restaurant using the chat app as well. pretty cool \\n\\nMoral of the story just go.

I overheard the hostess telling customers it was a 45 minute wait if you wanted to be seated on the patio (and of course you want to be seated on their beautiful patio on a gorgeous summer day). So naturally, when I saw how busy it was, I knew I had to go there to see what all the hype was about. My mom and I went for brunch on Monday, which was great because we were seated right away on the patio. We placed our drink order and our food order relatively quickly. I ordered a bloody mary and eggs benedict for my meal and my mom ordered a mimosa and omelet with a side of bacon. W probably waited at least a half hour for our food to come, which was a little bit frustrating because they weren't that busy. Tables around us were also starting to get frustrated and make comments to their servers. \\n\\nFinally our food came out and everything was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and their spicy potato hash that they give you is amazing. I had a bite of my mom's omelet and that was delicious as well. The manager even came over to apologize for the wait, which we really appreciated. \\n\\nI took off a star because of the wait but I took off a second star because of the price of the food. Our bill came to 80$...yep, that's right. 80$ for breakfast. Paying $6 for an extra side of bacon is a little ridiculous and it was only four pieces of bacon...it's not like they gave us the entire pig. I guess you're paying for the location of the restaurant, considering it is in Boston on Newbury street.

The pastitsio was not like anything ive ever had before with its taste of cinnamon but it was still good, though after a while the cinnamon flavor could be overpowering.  The decor of the place is quite boring i believe the only interesting part was the open kitchen right in the middle for everyone to see.  Of course the dishes were a little bit pricey at over 20 dollars a dish but i suppose this is expected for dining at disney.  \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, not so much the decor, glad I visited this place but will more than likely explore other dining options for my next trip to Orlando.."},{"name":"Coming Home Cafe","address":"753 6th Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"4","text":"Still a quaint coffee shop in New Westminster, just wanted to post an update for all you Gluten Free types out there - when I was there last week I noticed several GF items on their menu board."},{"name":"Charlie's Place-Pizza Chicken & More","address":"1740 Dorchester Ave","city":"Dorchester Center","stars":"3","text":"All their food is pretty darn good.

After my first experience of burnt coffee I have stupidily ordered twice more and also experienced burnt coffee. There is no reason that my skim milk latte should ever taste that bitter. I pay extra for the milk to be steamed and therefore sweeten the drink. I get nothing for my money and often can't finish the drink.\\n\\nThree times now, Diesel has either gotten our order wrong or completely forgotten about us. I realize the place is busy most of the time, but the system they have going seems like it's guaranteed to work. When we do hunt down our food, the employees begrudgingly fill our orders, but offer no compensation.\\n\\nNot only is the real-life service bad, but Diesel makes horrible use of it's Facebook page. Not trying to piss off baristas early in the morning, I used their wall as an outlet to complain, twice now, and received zero feedback. I noticed other customers have also complained and were not tended to. If you're going to use social media, use it right. Or if you're not going to answer customer complaints on your Facebook wall, at least delete them so you don't look like an a-hole.\\n\\nDiesel is huge. But not huge enough. And there are too many selfish people who believe they have the right to take up an entire 4 person booth. More single seating, please. Have you not noticed your patrons are scrambling for places to sit? Also, if the place is full, pay attention and stop offering us \\"for here\\" plates and mugs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I have had a lot of luck with non-coffee drinks and food at Diesel. The chai latte, both hot and cold, is good and not too sweet. \\n\\nMy favorite breakfast is the bagel & lox, which comes with tomatoes, cucumbers, cream cheese, and onions. This morning, we were given avocado as a substitute for missing onions. That girl is on my good side. I really like their cream cheeses, but highly recommend you eat your bagel with cream cheese there as it is loaded and messy. The breakfast burrito is awesome, too, and generously packed with spinach (probably to lower their costs), but still very filling.

Let me just say, the reviews did NOT disappoint!\\n\\nTo start, the chef was actually the person greeting us at the door. We were seated, he brought my son a high chair, and introduced himself. He is very personable, explained that he and his partner had a chance to open their dream restaurant shortly before passing of terminal cancer. What a bittersweet story. Continue to be doing what you're doing and your partner will be forever proud of you my friend!\\n\\nAnyway, on to the food. We started with the Tom Yum and, while there wasn;t too much substance tot he soup, the broth was awesome; probably the best Tom Yum I have ever had. Softshell crab with red curry from the \\"specials\\" menu was my main course which blew me away. Crab was lightly fried with a delicious red curry sauce spiced just right on top of a bed of various vegetables. My mother, whom I was dining with that evening, had the glass noodles with chicken and shrimp, equally delicious. Her plate was enough food that we didn't need to order something else for my wife as carryout, so that was nice!\\n\\nFor dessert we had the sweet sticky rice with coconut milk and fresh mango. I had never had anything like it, but man was it ever delicious. It is certainly not as cloyingly sweet as most traditional dessert menu items are (dessert generally means fudge brownies with chocolate sauce, ice cream, cake, etc to me), but it was absolutely refreshing and light.\\n\\nWhen our meal was done the chef came back out and asked how everything was. I was happy to say that our experience was flawless. When I asked if there was a changing table he said there regrettably wasn't, but actually thanked me for the idea and mentioned that the establshment was young and they are always slowly adding things that their patrons want/need. What a wonderful treat to be able to speak with the chef/owner and to have him be so receptive. The food could have been HALF as good as it was but I still would have left feeling that my experience was nothing but positive due to this warm reception.\\n\\nWe will undoubtedly be back!"},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Musashino has some really great reviews on Yelp and its reputation is pretty lofty overall.  I'm putting in a dissenting vote.  Before I go on, I will say that their fish quality is very good and our meal was delicious.  I was not displeased with my meal at all.  But here's why I'm only giving it 3 stars:\\n\\nFirst, this place is usually packed.  On one level, this is a good thing because the dining horde doesn't usually flock to crappy food.  Beyond that, though, it means that you have to wait quite a long time for a table.  Also, the dining area is really not conducive  to the amount of diners that they pack in.  The environment, therefore, starts to resemble a yakitori bar (think a Japanese pub, with appetizers on skewers).  Some may find it charming, but I think that the prices you're paying at Musashino should come with a little more breathing room (we were squeezed into the far end of a bar-like table, tightly next to another couple) and better service.  \\n\\nSpeaking of service, that's reason #2 for my mediocre review.  There just weren't enough waitresses for the number of customers.  It's plain mathematics.  When the wait staff isn't enough to attentively serve the amount of customers, everything suffers.  Things like getting drink refills to adding to your existing order to getting your bill to getting helpful explanations from waiters about the menu all are compromised.  \\n\\nThe sushi, like I first mentioned, was good.  We only ordered the rolls, but tried a good amount of them.  All tasted good.  Also, we tried the tuna tataki for an appetizer and fell in love with their spicy hybrid sauce.  I tried to figure out the ingredients in it, with limited success.  It's got some jalapeno, some lime, some mayonnaise, some wasabi...I don't know what else.  It was awesome.  \\n\\nThe price you pay at Musashino, in my opinion, is better spent at a different sushi restaurant.  Their fish isn't better than Mikado, for example, so look for a better setting to spend your well-earned coin."},{"name":"Canton Cooks","address":"5984 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This is one of those authentic Chinese restaurants that you take your family out to for a feast.

We've seen the business undergo various changes in ownership/management and renovations over the years, but one thing has remained the same - friendly service and decent pizza.\\n\\nWhile All Star has become more sophisticated since its days as a neighborhood pizza joint popular with parents and Little League Baseball teams, it still remains very much a casual restaurant with TVs for sports viewing and arcade games to play for fun.  My coworkers and I have conducted many a fantasy sports draft at All Star.  The layout works well for our large groups.\\n\\nAll Star doesn't get much business during the weekday lunch hour, which is the only times I've been.  Unlike other pizza restaurants, which may already have pizzas pre-made and sitting behind glass displays, all of All Stars' pizzas are made-to-order.

You can also order salads, breadsticks, strombolis, calzones, baked ziti, and subs.  I've tried the pizza, salad, breadsticks, strombolis, and calzones here.  Single serve orders of the strombolis and calzones are huge.

I got there at 930 pm and here's how it went. It took over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge me at the front. They sat me against a dark wall on my left and a couple to my right less than arms length away. The place is such a nice open area with a lot of other empty tables since it was late. I knew what i wanted to order right away. Colleen my server told me they didn't have fish and chips. So i went through the menu again. She didn't come back for at least 10 minutes. Then for dessert time, I got the menu and then again took a long time to come back, so I didn't bother to order dessert. It doesn't take long to get what I ordered from the bar and kitchen but waiting to give my order  was way too long. But this is what bothered me, the dialogue from my server felt so scripted and not genuine. No casual talk, just waiter talk. I didn't even get a suggestion when she told me they ran out of fish and chips.  Want anything to drink? Appetizers? Saved room for dessert? Want another drink?...Were all the talk i got from her."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I am a grilled cheese lover and I was so looking forward to trying this place. It was good. Did not blow my mind but was good. The truffle and rosemary fries were cooked perfectly but lacked a little in the rosemary department. The Mac & Cheese is more of a patty than what I was expecting but had a great taste. I had the Blackberry grilled cheese and the blackberry jelly overwhelmed the sandwich. My boyfriend had the fig and goat which was pretty good. The bread was toasted perfectly! They also have a Coke Freestyle machine which is always fun. The only really big issue I had was the fact that the tables are squeezed into a really small area. You sit right on top of the people next to you and moving around really isn't an option sometimes.

Add to that a fair sized menu with that hits a wide area of the food spectrum for both meat and non-meat eaters and I was pretty excited... which is probably why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4.  \\n\\nThe food sounds exciting when you look at their menu - kobe beef, buffalo burgers, mussels and chips, etc but it all lacks a certain quality of flavor.  I tried the hummus appetizer, the poboy sandwich and the mussels and chips.  All were just \\"meh\\".  On the other hand, the did have killer french fries (\\"chips\\" to the Brits).  \\n\\nBut what about the beers?  That's probably where this place shines.  50 beers on tap means it'd take you awhile to get through their offerings.  However, out of the 4 beers I tried a sip of, none of them really blew my socks off (granted I was wearing my tight socks - my bad?).  \\n\\nAll in all, not a bad place to come to for beers with some friends for an informal get together.  Board games by the door are a plus for geeks like me who like to have something to do while drinking a pint or two.  Would I make this a destination spot for a dinner with friends?

It's really hard to write a bad review for this place.  The wings are actually really, REALLY good.  It's the people that work here that give it a very bad name.  I've been here four times.  Now there is nothing more on the planet that I love to eat than wings, lobster and chocolate!  So with that being said, when I heard this place was coming to Randolph..I was counting the days for it to open!  I waited a few weeks for the bad kinks to calm down and than I came in one afternoon when it was quiet.  I ordered 15 wings and a large fry. I waited..and waited..and WAITED!  I watched the girl behind the counter dancing..around doing the \\"Nay-Nay\\", texting and going back and forth with her friends in the dining room.  Her friends I think also even worked there were literally laying all over the tables and chairs and fooling around with her.  The place was an absolute mess!  Napkins all over the floor, tables not clean and I went in to wash my hand in the bathroom and the bathroom was just nasty.  Meanwhile there she was dong the \\"Nay-Nay\\" having a grand ol' time for herself.  I'm watching them in the back of the kitchen making my food..and grabbing fries from the basket and just eating the fries right from the basket and jamming them in his mouth.  YES..you heard me right.  40 minutes go by (there were 2 people in the whole place!) and I finally get my 15 buffalo wings and head home..Now it's tough..because I have to say..they were damn good buffalo wings and the fries were fantastic. \\n\\nNow, second time I go back with my boyfriend..we encounter a new girl at the counter.  Very friendly, sweet and nice.  We get the 25 wings.  However, we were not told we were going to get charged per wing because of the tiny writing \\"boneless\\" on the menu. So the whole order go screwed up.  It ended up being a nightmare.  We got buffalo and lemon pepper wings. They really were awesome wings.  My boyfriend went up and asked for some blue cheese and they actually wanted to charge us.  Really? Come on. Are you kidding me?  \\n\\nThird and fourth time I just ordered on line to skip the nightmare of the first two visits.  Both times they were NOT ready of course.  The fourth time I went in there I had to wait 20 minutes for my order to come out!  Isn't that why you order ahead of time?  Not only that..they unfortunately were overcooked and just horrible.  Why I'm siting there waiting I'm listening the person cooking my food how she's sick of working so many hours, she's tired and she's unhappy working here.  \\n\\nThis place really needs some new management..FAST!  I really will be sad to see this place close like all the other places before it.  Because I actuallly really like the wings here.  Get rid of the employees who don't want to be here, who want to just sit around text and dance.  Find some people who actually want to work and enjoy their jobs!  I don't want to spend 30.00 on wings to come in and find some 18 year doing the \\"Nay-Nay\\" get it together..WingStop!!!  \\n\\nI happen to really love your wings..Lemon Pepper is absolutely amazing..Please don't leave my town!"},{"name":"Old Hickory House","address":"2202 Northlake Pkwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the worst BBQ i have ever had.

But we went anyway to check it out. They still have bottomless mimosas, which is crucial, but the food spread was disappointing. They kept some of the old Kasa stuff, but threw in rice and beans, which just isn't a brunch food in my book. But my second visit, for wine down, is what really brought down my opinion of the new place. The wine part was the same, but the appetizers were terrible. First, all they put out were bland wings and quinoa, so we decided to swing by a bit later hoping for some delicious tacos we saw advertised everywhere. They ran out of everything except orange slices right as we got to the front of the line, so we had to wait. Then they brought out these marshmallow dessert tacos and some sort of chicken pasta that was also bland, and half of the noodles were under cooked and hard.

They were all very tasty. The platter of delicious falafel stood out with it's extras, cucumbers, tomatoes, pickled turnips, and tahini sauce. The hummus was fresh and wonderful, very toned down on the garlic and could have used a touch more lemon. The fried kibbeh was flavorful but we probably would try something different next time as the dish, true to its roots, is a little dry. Overall, the appetizers stood out more memorably than the entrees. Next time I think we'll just try some combo platters and an extra order of falafel.\\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the lamb and chicken shawarma and the chicken kabobs. Sides included fries, tabouleh, fatoush, and more pickled veggies. There was plenty to eat. Lots of meat on the shawarma plates, and the kabobs were moist and grilled to perfection over a bed over grilled bell peppers and onions. Competent, tasty, filling, just slightly underwhelming all around compared to the falafel and humus. My companions did not care for their tabbouleh and I think they would have preferred the fatoush, which was fine. The pickled veggies were outstanding, with the pickled turnips getting an 11 on a ten point scale from me for crunch and punch.\\n\\nHere's where the other off note came with the service. Our server was attentive during the meal, stopping by to check on us and refill our water glasses multiple times. My son, who can finish an entire meal while the rest of the family is unfolding napkins, was the first one done. Perhaps she took that as a cue to present the bill. However, my daughter and I were barely half-way through our entree's when this happened. So, two things. She completely missed out on the opportunity to sell us dessert and coffee. Also, presenting the bill was not just leaving a folder on the table. It involved card swiping on a small tablet, e-signing, and tipping. Considering I was in the middle of eating, that was too intrusive. A more savvy server would have glanced at the table circumstances, asked my son if there was anything else she could bring for him, and come back about ten or fifteen minutes later. Trust me. It wasn't like they had to turn the table over in the two-thirds empty establishment. \\n\\nOverall experience? Nothing that screams we have to come back here, except for the falafel appetizer and the pickled turnips. If I'm in the neighborhood and craving fresh and healthy fare, I'd visit again, but I would not drive out of my way to come back."},{"name":"Blue Moon Pizza","address":"5610 Glenridge Dr, Ste 110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"24 dollars for a large cheese pizza?! does this have gold in it?? is it 4 feet wide?? never in my life...."},{"name":"Maher's Restaurant & Pub","address":"352 B Ave","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to say, because I know, that you should NOT frequent this establishment. \\n\\nThe food is microwaved (specifically the shepherd's pie, which is also made with a bag of pre-made mashed \\"potatoes\\").

For a long time, Hillsdale has been devoid of enjoyable places to eat. Breakfast is not something I typically go out of my way to seek, but I felt inclined due to close proximity. In the next several months more restaurants are going to be opening in Hillsdale and Multnomah Village. I don't think Gigi's has anything to worry about: they're unique dedication to middle-brow breakfast can win anyone over.\\n\\nLet me talk about the food. The Liege waffle is their signature item, and for good reason. As the servers are happy to tell you: the brioche dough is infused with crystalized chunks of pearl sugar, imported from belgium (i.e. waffle capital). These nuggets of sugar really make all the difference. I would not consider myself a waffle fan, but Gigi's waffles are smartly designed. The only problem I have with the waffles is that I consider them more suitable for dessert, than as a side to my scramble. The lemon curd waffle is what I would buy if I was in business for an afternoon dessert.\\n\\nLuckily you can enjoy many complete meals without any waffles. My personal favorite is the Corned Beef Hash, which has a variety of handcut  fried potatoes paired with house-cooked corned beef. This to me is the essential modern hash. The veggie alternative is equally tempting with it's oven roasted brussel sprouts. Eggs are a prominent cornerstone of the menu, and I would encourage you to ask for an over-medium egg. Unlike most cafes, Gigi's actually seems to pull off a consistent over-medium. While I can certainly recommend the bacon, I'll also put in a good word for the Scrapple. Apparently the chef and his uncle have spent years perfecting this old family recipe, and I feel lucky to have access to Scrapple on the west coast.\\n\\nMy advice to anybody thinking of trying out Gigi's Cafe for the first time: Come on a weekday. Weekend brunch can get crazy packed, and I find I am better able to appreciate the friendly service on an off hour. Thanks to the bar seating,  I've enjoyed chatting with the servers and even the two owners, which is an opportunity not available in too many restaurants!\\n\\nIn short, I am really pleased with what has become an awesome neighborhood spot for a late breakfast."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Good beer, horrible customer service.

Those who have tried it so far seemed to have had a good and tasty experience and mine was no different.  \\nCity Landing seems bigger than Sel de la Terre but that is because of how open they have made the space but also I think because the little food market is gone.  The space is very contemporary with a clean almost Californian feel.  Floor to ceiling windows look out ontoAtlantic Ave, adding more openness and natural light.\\n\\nI was meeting a friend and decided bar dining was the way to go.  I like what they have done with the bar area.  They have a beautiful long dark wood bar that seats about 20, high top booth seating and a long table with comfy high stools that runs down the middle seating about 15. \\n\\nThe place was very quiet for a Saturday night and after the large group seated at the center table moved, I was the only person sat at the bar while I waited for my friend.  Even being the only person, it seemed to take the bartender quite some time to notice me.  I finally had to raise my voice a little to get his attention.  I soon realized he was finishing his shift and his replacement was coming on board.  She was incredibly fun, thoughtful and friendly. \\n\\nAs I am still very much into Rose wine right now, I ordered a glass of lovely dry Triennes Rose, which was offered to me in a 6oz or 9oz pour.  I stayed with the 6oz served in its own little carafe.  \\n\\nMy friend arrived and ordered a Cabernet while we looked at the menu.  Bar dining also has an additional menu called \\"Bar Crumbs\\", which offers small plates, however we were very excited about the main menu and had a number of thoughts on what we both wanted.   \\n\\nWe started our evening with the Tuna Tartare to share.  Small chopped, delicate tiny bites of melt in your mouth tuna atop just the right amount of sticky rice that didn't overwhelm the tuna.  I loved the kick of soy-wasabi and ginger-pickled cucumber that gave this appetizer a unique and fresh flavor.   I am a big and somewhat judgmental fan of tuna tartare and this is one I would highly recommend.\\n\\nFor my main, I was truly at a loss of what to order with choices on offer of fresh and interesting looking fish and meat entr√©es to pasta and pizza dishes to the more traditional of liver and onion and not forgetting classic sides of mac n' cheese.  I finally got some help from our bartender who suggested her favorite dish of Pan Roasted Flounder.  I was so glad she did.  Flaky, mild, buttery white fish combined brilliantly with sweet tomatoes, asparagus and a crunch of artichoke.  Just a mild tang of champagne-mustard sauce gave this dish something a little special.  I noticed a lot of flair to simple dishes on the menu created by Chef Bill Brodsky.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Chicken Francais, which I have to say was incredibly appealing to look at; full of bright and vibrant colors.  She said it was... \\"lovely, butter, tender and tasty.  You can't go wrong with a wine and butter sauce.\\"  There wasn't even a morsel left on her plate.  I think next time this will be on my to order list.\\n\\nWe stayed for a while longer and talked to the bartender and a few of the managers, while we enjoyed more wine.  Catherine commented that she really wanted some cookies and joked about one of them running out to Starbucks to buy her one.  Next thing you know, two warm, chocolate chip cookies were placed in front of us.  They did say they ran out to buy them but who knows.  Either way what a lovely (free) treat. \\n\\nThe place remained quiet throughout the whole evening, perhaps it was because of the long weekend but it didn't affect our absolutely lovely evening.  The price point is a little high for entr√©e dishes, especially if you also want sides; however it is possible to enjoy a more cost effective evening of \\"Bar Crumbs\\", appetizers and pizzettas. \\n\\nI will be back to enjoy more of what this new restaurant has to offer and can see it becoming a popular spot for the after work crowd.

The restaurant was pretty empty and so was the bar.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered the grilled veggie gazpacho and the crispy duck.  \\n\\nHere's the breakdown for the 3 stars:\\n\\n5 stars - Service.  The bar staff, the manager, the hosts... all were pleasant.  I can't complain.  They were attentive.  They said hi and bye.  They checked back to see if I needed anything.  They refilled my water.  They were quick.  \\n\\n3 stars - Food.  The gazpacho was mediocre at best.  It was a little too sweet for my taste and not savory enough.  Everything was pureed and I didn't really taste too much of the roasted vegetables.  It kinda reminded me of a not-so-salty V8.  The crispy duck was eh.  It wasn't crispy and the duck was tough to cut through.  The sides it came with were actually pretty good.  The wild rice, pecan and butternut squash mixture was great.  But I ordered the dish for the duck.  So... \\n\\nSo given these two ratings, it should average out to a 4.  \\n\\nBUT, my experience there wasn't exactly the best.  I actually hated my dinner \\"companions\\".  It's not entirely the restaurant's fault but ambiance, mood, all of it plays into the experience of the restaurant.  Help me out here folks.  When you see a guest who is clearly uncomfortable, rescue her.  Not your job but sort of... it is.  There was a lady one seat down from me that was on her 5 glass of wine by the time I left.  In 40 minutes, she had downed 3 glasses of wine.  She was progressively getting drunker and louder.  Then, there was the obnoxious extrovert who decided that wedging himself between me and drunk lady would be a great idea when almost the entire bar area was empty.  He kept asking me about my duck and how he ordered a salad since he has a doc appointment coming up and can't afford luxuries and decadence like my dinner.  Sorry bro but you ordered a Caesar salad topped with a ton of dressing, cheese and croutons and served in a fried tortilla bowl.  Last, there was an awkward first date happening at the end of the bar and the guy kept asking each other highly inappropriate questions.  \\n\\nFor this experience, that's a 1.  \\n\\nSo for this entire restaurant, they get more of a 3.5.... but Yelp doesn't offer halves so 3."},{"name":"Atmosphere Bistro","address":"1620 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been here three or four times now and have enjoyed each of my visits.\\n\\nThe place is small and quaint with a nice outside seating area.  \\n\\nThe appetizers are nice.

Let's start with the food. We had 7 people in our party and selected 6 different dishes plus a couple of appetizers. We tried - fried calamari, chicken wings, Lingcod in curry, shortrib sandwich, lamb, veal, lettuce cups. No complaints from anyone! Everyone loved their food. It was all so fresh and prepared with great favors. The restaurant is in Canada Place right on the harbor and we were seated close to the huge window which covered one wall of the restaurant. It was a great view! Onto the customer service - what can I say when our water glasses never got below half full? At least four different servers came around with water pitchers everytime we took a drink out of our glass. Our server told my daughter that her drink would be on her to celebrate her birthday. Additionally, we ordered a few drinks that we wanted to share since we are not big drinkers. The half drinks in their individual glasses that were brought to us were almost as big as one full drink! Finally, the shortrib sandwich came later than the others and the server told us that he would take it off our check because we shouldn't have had to wait for it. When the bill came, everything they said they would take care of was off the check. I hate it when an establishment tells you that they are going to take it off your check and then don't and you have to ask about it. Not Cactus Club!

They were only slightly better this time around. And then I got my bill... I was charged for 2 orders of wings. I asked what that was about and my waitress rolled her eyes and ripped the receipt out of my hand. She came back with another that only showed 1 order of wings, which was finally correct.

I drove right back down to the restaurant and asked for a manager. The manager came out with an attitude and asked what the problem was. I showed that my account was cleared out.

It should be somewhat crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. If it was freshly baked and warm that wouldn't hurt either.\\n\\nBagel world's bagels are all these things. They are as close to a NY bagel as I've ever eaten up here.\\n\\nIt's bizarre really. In NY you can't get the fried clams with the bellies. We can't get the Jewish Deli's they have. We're 4 friggin hours away. How is that possible? It's retahded!!! They have clams there. We have Jews here!\\nWTF is the big deal!\\n\\nAnyway The perfect bagel also must have taste and toppings. So if I order a poppy seed bagel. I want tons of those little black dots all over the bagel and in it. I want to taste Sesame Seeds and have them everywhere. I want my raisins to be doused and drowned in Cinnamon. \\n\\nBagel World is all these things.\\n\\nThe have LOX spread and NOVA. For you Goyim out there that is smoked salmon and any bagel place that doesn't have it is NOT a bagel place at all. \\n\\nMy perfect bagel:\\n\\nToasted Poppy Seed with cream cheese, butter, NOVA bermuda onion and a thick slice of tomato.\\n\\nBagel World has this. It is a great place. \\n\\nI know this of course because I'm a Jew from NY and we need more Bagel Worlds and MORE Jewish deli's because I still miss my Knish, Chopped Liver, Matzoh Ball soup and Stuffed Derma.\\n\\nChrist it's only 4 hours away."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The business is a joke.

We started off with the avocado salsa sampler, one had lump crab nestled on top, one guacamole had goat cheese and chipotle peppers mixed in and one was just your traditional guacamole.  DELICIOUS! Wow! How have more restaurants not thought to do this? The crab avocado salsa was by far my favorite, packed with flavor but the creaminess from crab made it absolutely incredible.\\n\\nWe also had the mixed pepper and acorn squash salad which is hardly a salad but a whole lot of yummyness.  Roasted squash slices topped with spicy peppers from shishito to chipotle, this is definitely an interesting take but I would consider it more of an appetizer than a salad.\\n\\nFor my main I got the street tacos and while they were pretty to look at that didn't translate to taste.  The fish was dry and way way over-fried, the garlic shrimp was tasteless and the mushroom was just fine.  After such a strong start to the meal, I was disappointed in the tacos.  After eyeing the dishes that sat at tables around me, I would have gone with the El Burro or even the butternut squash soup had I known.\\n\\nNow, the cocktails were absolutely impeccable. Each one was fabulous and it was very clear that whoever running the bar program knows that they are doing.  I had the seasonal daiquiri and I can't remember if I have ever ordered a daiquiri before in my life but boy, was I glad I did.\\n\\nAll in all, the experience was made by the cocktails and the extremely friendly staff.

One of the vendors said they were expecting over 100 people which I thought was too much for the space because it got extremely crowded.  You weren't able to spend as much time talking to pourers and after awhile, it just became grab your sample, then get out of the way.

With Himalayan salt and other meaty goodness, the resulting soup is surprisingly clear (no muddy cloudiness of pork bits floating around) and rich. I love the angel leek topping and creamy egg. Char siu (BBQ Pork) is done nicely with thin slices that are grilled before serving. Great for those of us nursing a cold. \\n\\nSpicy miso, shoyu and charcoal miso are also favourites. If you aren't afraid of the gooey mess of grated yam, the cold ramen is also excellent. \\n\\nI don't think I've ever been unhappy with any of my visits. Even when the staff brought me a bit of uncooked noodles, they simply apologized graciously and offered to replace it with another bowl of my choice.

For my appetizer I ordered the sampler. Which came with nachos, wings, onions rings and mozzarella sticks. It was so good ! It was only 10 dollars. The beer of the month is Budweiser, so I order one. I was full off the appetizer and decided to get the wings to go. Ebony had out refills coming and checked on us constantly.

I know I shouldn't be ordering that crap, but I had a craving.  Sue me.  I have a pile of takeout menus, and this place's looked promising, though I thought the mascot on the front resembled Obama (am I the only one)?  Big mistake.  Huge!  I've ordered my fair share of takeout from the area and this was the worst.  The steak and cheese was pretty devoid of cheese, which wasn't the worst part.  It was the sawdust shavings that pass for steak.  It reminded me of flakes of dried crusty lead paint chips (actually, lead paint probably tastes better - isn't that why children liked eating it)?  Not at all juicy, and bland to boot.  My DC had the same and was as displeased as I was with it.  He also ordered fries.  Despite their being overcooked, I ate one - remarkably, it was a french fry that looked like it was giving the finger (it clearly knew something I didn't).  That was the coolest part about this awful meal.  The misshapen french fry.  Anyway, it tasted like nothing.  Not a lick of salt on them, and they were cold just like everything else.  I think in an earlier review, I said even bad fries were good - I would like to formally retract that comment.  I'm amazed reading the positive reviews - we got this garbage for $17 and there was nothing redeeming about it.  I mean, I don't expect gourmet greatness, but I expect more than crusty, tasteless, cold food.  We clearly ordered the wrong thing . . . and this place left such a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), I think the menu is getting chucked in the trash.  My advice - don't do it!!

While waiting for my food I was able to look at the various syrups, hot sauces, potions, elixirs, treats and cheeses. \\n\\nWhile perusing the menu, I decided i would need at least four (4) trips back to try different items that tickled my fancy. Alas, I settled on the Shaved Beef sandwich. My food came out quickly and was perfectly prepared. The Shaved Beef sandwich was incredible. The arugula was fresh and nutty, the horseradish sauce amazing with just enough of a bite to it, and the beef was perfectly prepared - pink and savory, the way it should be. The ciabatta added a perfect crunchiness to the sandwich. This dish came with onion rings. I don't even like onion rings, and I told Jara that. You know Jara, right? The acclaimed director? Well I had one bite of an onion ring and realized it was the best onion ring I've ever had in my life. They were thin and crispy with a delicious batter that wasn't too oily or greasy.\\n\\nWhile I was sauntering around the cafe before my meal arrived, my eyes fell upon the sea salt and chocolate chip cookies. I fancy myself as a bit of a cookie monster, and these bad boys began calling my name. As soon as the food arrived I placed an order for this little piece of divinity. The cookie arrived as I was finishing my meal. The balance of saltiness and sweet was perfect. The odd shape was indicative of the amount of care taken to prepare this treat. I topped it all off with a shot of espresso, and debated tipping $50. Of course, I didn't tip $50. Just a 20% tip. But if I were Mr. Moneybags, I would've tipped $50. I considered telling my server, who strongly resembled Jake Gyllenhaal, that he just served me the best lunch I've had in Austin in 2014.

I only say this because their pricing is out of this world. Growing up in Texas on BBQ (Blacks Barbecue, Smittys Market, Dickies, Sonny Brian's, The Salt Lick, etc...), 28 dollars should buy you a feast for a family of 4, with plenty leftover! At Sweet Cheeks, 28 dollars gets you two small portions of meat and a couple ice cream scooped sides. The food is good.\\nI ordered a quarter pound of pork belly, a quarter pound of brisket and an order of fried okra. Both the pork belly and brisket were amazing. Very juicy and tender and had a nice smoky flavor. I could probably have pork belly for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was amazing. The barbecue sauces they make are also really good. I was not so impressed with the fried okra. They batter and fry the entire okra which I thought was nice as I'm used to cut rounds of fried okra. However, it was fried a little too long, so much so that the okra itself shriveled up and disappeared. I prefer soft tender fried okra. (Perhaps finding decent okra in the north east is to blame). I've heard that their other side items are really good, but I have yet to try them. One addition I'd like to see to the menu is homemade country sausage.\\nI left there feeling very full, mostly due to my large consumption of beers. The beer selection is really nice. I enjoyed Bubs Tap which I was told is the owner's husband's home brew. They have an impressive cocktail list. You can even order a michelada!\\nThe atmosphere is nice. Very warm and comforting. The place has a nice smoky smell but not overwhelming.\\nI will definitely be coming back again to try more items on the menu. My only complaint is the price. If the price was more reasonable, I can see this place lasting a long while. I don't mind spending big money, just give me big food! If the idea is to bring true Texas barbecue to Boston, please get the price right! A true Texas barbecue joint wouldn't charge these exorbitant prices.

So many places outside of the Great Republic of Texas ruin brisket by trimming all of the fat off before smoking or they simply buy the lean flat side.

And if you go there and you order brisket and they bring it and it has fat on it, be a little open minded and try it before you make the NE OMG WTF face.  LOL\\n\\nSo, on to the food:\\n\\nBrisket, cooked perfectly, but could use a little salt.  Served dry as it should be.  The meat was wonderful and melt in your mouth.  This should be served without question with white bread, onion and pickle.  For some reason you have to ask for it.  But, at least it is on offer.\\n\\nRibs, cooked wonderfully.  Served dry as they should be.  Fall off the bone.\\n\\nSides - Beans.  This was funny.  They serve beans like I am used to and if you think about, I would only think of them as Beans or BBQ Beans.  The lady made an effort to explain that they were not Boston Baked Beans and that we would need to be prepared. S o I had to ask why she would think I would go to a BBQ place and even want Boston Baked Beans.  It was funny.\\n\\nSide - Broccoli  Cheese casserole  - Fantastic.\\n\\nDesert - You have to try their Chocolate Root beer Cake.  This thing was  amazing.  It is my next B-Day cake.

It seems like once a month they run a special of $30 for only $20 which can be added to the enomatic card.  This is a great deal so I typically double their offer and will spend $40 to receive $60 credit on the card.  We have a wine app on the phone to use while tasting.  Usually one of the employees will come and chat with us about our slections.\\n\\nThe pricing on their retail bottles is very fair and the case discounts are a great deal.  We love that their selection is from smaller and more specialized wineries.  We are Costco members and that selection is good, however I have purchased many wines from Costco that were mediocre to awful.  The beauty of Vino Venue is the ability to taste the wine in a half or full glass before purchasing.  This year I splurged on a $100 bottle of white wine from Costco.  I wanted to cry after the first sip.  It was mediocre, barely one notch above bad.  Bottles that cost me in the $20 range at Vino Venue were far better.  Multiple times this year I have been burned on wine purchases that I regretted.  I have determined that if I plan to spend $40+ on a bottle, I just head for Vino Venue to taste before I purchase.\\n\\nFood, both appetizers and entr√©es range from good to great.

I tried Five Guys today for lunch for the first time and have to say I wasn't very impressed.  Yes, the provide you with copious quantities of meat (I ordered the regular bacon cheeseburger and reg cajun style fries) and potatoes, but I would expect nothing less for $11.32 (including a regular sized drink).\\n\\nThe burger was tasty, but there was nothing special about it.  As mentioned above, I had the regular (which is double patty) bacon cheeseburger with mayo, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions, lettuce and tomatoes.  There was plenty of patty, and they didn't skimp on the toppings either, so props there.  But the bacon left a lot to be desired for a bacon cheeseburger -- it was chewy at best.  I am of the mindset that bacon on any burger should always be crispy, and never chewy.  I don't want to have to fight the burger to get a piece of bacon when I bite into it.  The meat itself was okay, but again, nothing special.  I've had just as good a burgers at Burger King -- though Five Guys quality is definitely better than most fast food.  Then again, for an almost $12 lunch, it damn well should be.\\n\\nThe fries again, were nothing more than average at best.  The cajun seasoning wasn't salty enough (fries should always have salt), and the fries seemed very dry.\\n\\nI can say without a doubt that I would not return to Five Guys in Austin ever again, especially not with all the incredible burger places there are in Austin.  If someone were to ask me if they should try it, I'd say -- \\"It's not worth the money or the drive to get there, and if you do decide to go anyway, it's mediocre at best.\\"\\n\\nTake all that for what you will.  I'm disappointed with all the hype this place gets.  And what really gets me, is the cost of a meal there.

It has a faintly unpleasant odor and while there are some tables, it is definitely a take-out place. \\n\\nThe guy who took our order on the phone and who talked to us when we were there was very pleasant. We had to wait a few minutes, but we had gotten there a bit early.\\n\\nOnce our food was ready, we we went home to stuff ourselves.\\n\\nThe Peking Ravioli (10 for less than $7? Nice!) were a nice size, with a doughy outside and a nice, flavorful inside. I was not a big fan of the ginger dipping sauce (I prefer a scallion-based one), but that's personal preference.\\n\\nWe both got Combination Plates, as they are such a good value. I went with Chicken with Broccoli (and added carrots) and my husband went with Chicken with Cashews. Both had way less chicken than veggie, and his had way more veggies than other places tend to do. The sauce on mine was VERY watery and didn't have as much flavor as I like.\\n\\nBoth had, of course, a ridiculously huge amount of pork fried rice. My husband ate most of it between 2 meals. The boneless spare ribs were very fatty and he said the egg roll was so-so.\\n\\nHe said he would probably order from here again, but I want to try some other places first. King Fung Garden in Chinatown is supposed to be fantastic. I just wish this take-out location lived up to the original...\\n\\nIf you're looking for quick, cheap, typical Chinese take-out, this is the place."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"401 Park Drive","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Maybe I am wanting too much from longhorn, but I hate it.

It's not too sweet, and pretty darn tasty!\\n\\nSweetleaf - pear, mint, lemon, ginger, spinach, kale, parsley, cucumber\\nYou get this juice about every day, too. It's SWEET! I'm surprised it's classified as 'super green' for how sweet it is.\\n\\nSpicyleaf - jalape√±o, green pepper, spinach, kale, parsley, apple, cucumber, celery\\nHoly guacamole this is SPICY! I had to open up my cashew milk and take sips in between for how spicy this was!\\n\\nGreen lemonade - lemon, ginger, pineapple, spinach, kale, parsley, pear, cucumber\\nI was bummed I only got this one time in my 4 day cleanse because it was one of my favorites!!\\n\\nGreen limeade - lime, mint, orange, spinach, kale, parsley, green pepper, cucumber\\nI prefer the green lemonade - this one gets a little bitter tasting, but still not complaining!\\n\\nWondrous punch - strawberry, orange, pear, apple, spinach, kale, beet, carrot\\nDelicious, and again, very sweet!\\n\\nOrange Giant - orange, lime, apple, beet, carrot\\nThis one is really delicious with the half almond.\\n\\nSweet Carrotlime - pear, lime, ginger, orange, carrot\\nYUM\\n\\nPineapple Express - pineapple, ginger, orange, carrot\\nI never got this during my cleanse so I unfortunately can't review it\\n\\nG8 - tomato, jalape√±o, green pepper, celery, carrot, spinach, parsley, beet\\nOf all the juices, this is the only one I didn't like. I think it was something about the heavy tomato - it just didn't sit right with me.\\n\\nOK, so those are all the juices that they bottle. I think what would have made me like this cleanse more was if they bottled their 'The Garden' juice (carrot, tomato, kale, cucumber, green pepper, basil, apple, ginger) - because they don't, and I didn't like the G8, I didn't get any \\"veggie packed\\" juices in my cleanse and I wish I Had. the sweet juices were a little too sweet for me. I WILL say this juice cleanse was very filling though - at the end of the cleanse I still had 3 juices leftover and ended up going into day 5 because i couldn't get  through all 6 in a day. And I was working out like I always do (I'm a fitness instructor and I kept teaching my classes - they say to avoid heavy exercise, but as long as I had half of an almond juice before and half after, I was fine).\\n\\nOverall, I felt good about the cleanse, but not quite as good/flushed out as I did after the PJP cleanse.\\n\\nALSO, I feel like there were quite a bit of issues with things. My friend who I did it with didn't get her cashew milk the first two days and kept having to walk to the shop to get one. I was very vocal that i wanted lots of variety in my juice selection each day but there were days where I got duplicates - one day I got two wondrous punches and 2 greenleafs. But, I was able to walk to the store and switch them out, so at least there's out. With PJP I was able to customize exactly which juices I wanted on each day - Greenleaf was less flexible.\\n\\nMy overall thought is if you want to do a cleanse, you can't go wrong with either location and I fully support it as long as you listen to your body! I felt great and totally energized during both, and I think it's a great way to get back onto healthy eating patterns or flush out bad stuff from your body when you need it."},{"name":"Watershed on Peachtree","address":"1820 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food here is excellent.

Ambiance.  :-)"},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Enjoying tapas is somewhat of a culinary adventure:  dish after dish arrives in quick succession, each one offering a different aroma and taste to surprise your palate.  Traditionally, tapas (which literally means \\"to cover,\\" but in the culinary world means small dishes of food) were served to encourage conversation, with the idea that people do not have to remain so focused on a large meal placed in front of them, but can instead move around and converse between courses. Tasca, in Brighton, serves a variety of small plates in a large but cozy atmosphere that immediately transports one to Madrid, Barcelona or wherever your dream Spanish destination may be.\\n \\nAs we followed the hostess to our tiny corner table, it was hard for my guest and I not to notice the alluring d√©cor.  The restaurant adopted a rustic French interior design theme with a Spanish twist.  The vibe is romantic, but sexy -- dark red spicy colored walls with dim lighting and gorgeous candles create a perfect dinner atmosphere.\\n \\nAfter ordering about eight different plates to split between the two of us, we ordered a pitcher of sangria ($18), which was strong but sweet.  The slices of juice-soaked apples and oranges added a classic Spanish touch and were the perfect treat to nibble on after we guzzled down each glass.\\n \\nOnly 10 quick minutes passed while sipping on Sangria before our first dish was brought out. The herbed goat cheese fritters served on oven-dried vine-ripened tomatoes ($6.95) were the best tapas of the evening.  The deep-fried hor d'oeuvres were delightful; the soft cheese was a great textural contrast to the shell of the crispy pocket.  The delicious baked bread that came with the dish is great for mopping up any gooey leftovers. \\n \\nNext, our waitress brought out the slow oven-braised boneless beef short ribs over scallion-mashed potato in jus ($6.95), a heaping portion that we couldn't finish. The mashed potatoes were light and fluffy, the perfect consistency served with the tender, flavorful beef.  We dug into the Casoulet Cazuela of beef, duck, chicken and chorizo braised with tomatoes, vegetables and white beans ($6.50), which was slightly reminiscent of a Super Bowl-type bean dip, but instead packed a sophisticated flavor and texture.\\n \\nThe buttery-garlic escargot ($6.95) were served piping hot and bursting with flavor. The Alb√≥ndigas homemade tenderloin meatballs in green peppercorn sauce ($4.95) were enjoyable, but forgettable. The oven-crisped garlic infused chicken ($6.50) and the Tortiall Espanola ($4.50), a Spanish potato and onion omelet, are valid replacements Although we were stuffed from the savory courses, we opted for the Pastel Vasco ($5.95), a layered dessert of a homemade Oreo-type cookie base laced with milk toffee, bananas and lots of whipped cream. The dish, which is big enough to share, had a complex but not cloying flavor profile: sweet, salty, crispy and smooth all worked together in perfect harmony.\\n \\nI give Tasca an eight out of 10.  The service was decent and most of the dishes were cooked perfectly and had an amazing array of flavors. Good value, an extensive wine list and menu, and the great location near campus all make Tasca a great choice for a special occasion or romantic Friday night dinner."},{"name":"Chopstix Chinese & Sushi Cuisine","address":"4300 W Lake Mary Blvd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"This place is under new management and you should give it another chance if you hated it before.

I didn't question her though and ordered what was safe and I still got very sick after. My mom and I had the same thing with the exception of me getting a side of hollandaise which I was assured was gluten free.

Also one of my favorite is their seafood salad with extra dressing on the side.  Freshness and quality is ok and it is a bit pricey; around 10$ for a specialty roll.  For a small person like me I still need at least 2 specialty rolls to fill myself up.  Kadoya is run by the chinese as I can hear them playing chinese music and speaking loudly in mandarin.

When they came off I noticed the ribs had curled. The membrane in fact was not removed and was pulling apart on the back. This essentially ruined the ribs. No smoke flavor was absorbed due to the membrane and it makes a real mess of the ribs.

I was crunched for time during lunch. I had to run by Walmart to pick up some school supplies to donate to a local school for work. There was a Bill Miller Bar-B-Q right by the Walmart I went to. Bill Miller is a local chain that was started in San Antonio. They use a commissary concept. Everything is smoked or prepared at a central kitchen and then delivered to their 67 locations. My favorite things to get at Bill Miller Bar-B-Q are their breakfast tacos, fried chicken, and sweet tea. I like getting the brisket and egg, chicken and egg, or smoked sausage and egg breakfast tacos in the morning. Their fried chicken is really good too. I have a Bill Miller mug that I can get a refill of 32 ounces of sweet tea for 50 cents. \\n\\nToday, I got the rib plate with two meats which included marbled brisket and sausage. On the side, I got coleslaw, potato salad, and hash browns. I was a little embarrassed to bring in my DSLR so I left it in the car. I just used my iPhone to snap a couple of pics. I never knew they had moist brisket. I always assumed they had lean, but I asked for the moist just in case today. They did have some, and it was not that terrible. It was tender and had a nice smoke ring. The flavor was a little lacking, and I could not taste any smoke. That is what barbecue sauce is for I guess. The ribs were actually surprisingly decent. They were juicy and a decent flavor. Their commercial sausage was good. It had a good casing and grind. The hash browns were good as usual. The coleslaw was a little vinegary but not bad. The potato salad had a consistency like mashed potatoes.\\n\\nFor being a barbecue chain, it is not terrible. They are very consistent and reasonable priced. They have daily specials, and you can get out of there on the cheap. They are open for all meals and every day of the week. If you do not want \\"fast food,\\" stop here when you need a quick meal."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Ehhhh could be much better.

It turns out that they were putting everyone into a line at the curtain to be seated, both those with and without reservations! Needless to say, 2 couples who came in AFTER US and people without reservations were seated prior to us. UGH!! I cannot explain how disgusted I was at this point. My boyfriend is usually the calmer of the two of us, but he was getting agitated and talking about complaining to a manager. We decided to see how the service went after we were seated... being the reasonable people we are. Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised.

The food came out in a timely manner, not too fast, and he checked on us for drink refills many times, and even brought me a giant bowl of crushed red pepper (my favorite)! I also appreciated that we were not rushed out even though we did not get dessert. Apparently they are running a promotion where if you order from the \\"classic pasta\\" section of the menu, you get an entire 2nd dish to take home. He asked whether I would like the same dish or something different, and brought it out to me. We left him a huge tip because he had really made the difference in how our evening went.

The chicken kabab was supposed to come with onions, peppers, tomatoes, and humus. Well it was chopped up chicken with raw peppers. Not a drop of humus nor an onion or tomato to be found  and I dont know where or what the wetness came from but the roll was sopping wet that it disintegrated.  As for for cheese steak with mushrooms the roll was in the same status which confuses me since there wasnt a wet item nor were there any mushrooms. I did ask for oregano on the sub but it seems as though the cook doesnt know the difference from oregano and pepper. It was so spicey with black pepper it was inedible.  The size wasnt any bigger than a d,angelo sub but it cost $3 more and I didnt even get what I ordered or wanted to eat.

Then, when I told him it was my first time in, he graciously explained the menu, the sizing portions, and even made the rec of getting the hickory cheeseburger with bacon since I don't do all that \\"lettuce tomato ketchup mustard pickle\\" business on my burgers.

So I pick up my sandwich and I'm thinking this has to be fantastic. I take a bite... disappointing!

Since I was with and meeting others, I decided to stay the course and give the spot a chance.\\n\\nParking- they have valet, which we used, but I could tell from the size of the lot there wasn't a lot of parking available.  I would not feel safe parking on the street in this area.  So thank goodness for valet in this case.  The valet guys were also super nice.\\n\\nInside- The place is small and the noise level was high.  The decor looked cheap and \\"cliche\\" modern.  The male bartenders seemed to forget that they were at work, spent too much time hitting on me instead of treating/seeing me as a customer.  That was disappointing, because of that, they forgot about delivering the drinks because they stayed distracted(chatting up random women).  We ended up flagging the woman bartender and she was on point.  Of course the guy bartender had the nerve to try to intervene after making us wait 10 min to say he had the drinks, at this point, we said no way and told him why and he backed down.  What could he really say?  lol \\nOne thing that I missed in the drink mayhem was ordering & ensuring that top shelf liquor was in my mixed drink.  Honestly, I assumed with the price paid, it would be a top shelf product.  I was wrong and needless to say, I ended up sick from 1 drink because of the cheap liquor.  \\n\\nFood- as probably already mentioned, they will seat other parties at your table.  I didn't realize this and I was not a fan of this protocol.  We ordered, our order got screwed up and trying to get it straightened out was overkill.  I was over it.  The people who got food shared and I did like what I had an opportunity to taste, I didn't personally get my order as it was one of the orders that did not come out.  Given the general attitude so far, I didn't want to chance having a possibly annoyed cook/chef making my food after the mix up.\\n\\nOverall- I won't say I won't ever go back but I can say it won't and is not on my list of places to patronize again as the overall experience just wasn't memorable enough for me due to the lack of quality in service and appreciating patronage."},{"name":"Maher's Restaurant & Pub","address":"352 B Ave","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Maher's is always a chill place to go.

I especially love their chicken salad sandwiches, but basically everything is great.  \\nTheir potato salad is different - not bad - just different, and takes some getting used to.

I have recently learned that the manager there now works at the Kits branch and on a recent trip, was not disappointed again. She is excellent in serving customers. Question - can you train the staff at the 5th Avenue branch? Their service is shockingly poor. \\n\\nI recently brought my own containers to the 5th Avenue restaurant to do a take-out. As a conscientious consumer, I realise I don't have to partake in the degradation of the environment by using the restaurant's styrofoam boxes. The head server at 5th Avenue first delayed taking my order (waited 10min) while the other servers just stood and watched me waiting...  I explained that there were more than enough compartments in the two containers I brought to put all the food I ordered. On top of my two dishes, I was supposed to receive 2 orders of rice and 1 order of noodles. \\n\\nShe then insisted I pay up front but made me wait a long time before taking my payment. I finally said I wasn't going to wait there to pay and would pay when i returned to get my order in 15-20min. \\n\\nWhen I returned, my order was \\"ready\\" and when I checked the order, I noticed I was short one order of rice which I had paid for. I asked the server about it and she started to scowl and first said that I hadn't looked properly at my container and that it was correct. When I opened up the containers, she realized the kitchen had made a mistake, but rather than just filling the container with another portion of rice, she got me a styrofoam container of rice. She then promptly told me that the problem was I brought my own containers and that I should not do so again in the future. Imagine that! No apology for the previous service nor the incorrect order but blaming the customer for the kitchen mistake. \\n\\nI gather she will not serve me if I bring my own containers in the future, so my decision is not to patronize that restaurant again. Every other restaurant (including the other Peaceful Restaurants) I've ever done take-out with has accommodated and many even said more patrons should do that!

Orange or grapefruit. And an odd, \\"I don't know where they squeeze it\\" thrown in. Eh? The server quickly added that she didn't know whether it would be squeezed upstairs or downstairs (huh?) but I gave the orange juice a go anyway.\\nAt $4 it cost the same as a happy hour beer. Came chilled and with no ice to take up space in your tall glass. Looked cloudy and had pretty fine pulp. Didn't have the same artificial intensity as Tropicana or Oasis.\\n\\nAfter sampling my friend's calamari appy (which looked more like a dinner plate of calamari, to be honest) that had a strange oiliness to the flavour even though it didn't look oily at all, I skipped straight to dessert  http://www.cactusclubcafe.com/menus/food/desserts/\\nThe very first item, the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bar, was emphasized in a grey box. I inquired about whether it was something special and was expecting to simply be told that it was a Rob Feenie Signature Dish http://www.cactusclubcafe.com/menus/food/rob-feenie-signature-dishes/ Many items on the menu are marked \\"RF\\" to indicate this. Instead she said she didn't know why it was highlighted that way, and that, if anything, the menu should mention their current seasonal special, a pumpkin cheesecake.\\nI thanked her for telling me, though I also wondered that they were so busy I wasn't told of specials when the menu was brought to me.\\n\\nThe Pumpkin Cheesecake ($8.25, the par price for all their desserts) was a slightly smallish slice on a plate drizzled with caramel. The main flavour is the cheese and if you swab your bites with the caramel on the plate, you also get strong caramel flavour -- and the both combined wiped out any hint of pumpkin. Otherwise it was a really decently done cheesecake. Light in taste and texture, not crumbly. Price is either somewhat awful for portion or inflation has seriously caught up.\\n\\nFrom the little I've seen so far, food isn't anything super special (might have to focus on the RF signature dishes next time). You are here (and paying for) for the convenient, location, the views, the happy hour, and the people watching--All off which could add another star for you.\\n\\nIt can be hard to catch the eye of a waitress, so your bet bet might actually be to just sit tight until they check on you. And in such a busy place, they WILL check on you with increasing frequency if you are there for a while and your party hasn't fully assembled. Space is money and they need to see you drinking or ordering food.\\nIf that is off-putting for you, go with a tighter group or assemble everyone first -- or go somewhere else.

By the end of our dazzling meal, I for one couldn't resist racing to the nearest nursery to stock up on some fresh herb plants for my personal vegetable garden.\\n\\nAfter 15 seasons, numerous awards, recognitions, the 1st Primo at Rockland Maine has matured into what Chef Melissa Kelly calls a \\"Full Circle Kitchen...\\" the ultimate farm to table experience. And she has brought this unique and delightful experience to two other locations - JW Marriott located in Orlando and Tuscon, Arizona.\\n\\nWhat started with a garden, a few hens and a couple of pigs has now become an evolution of food; an endless pursuit to accomplish more. Primo is much more than a restaurant, it is about love and respect for food. It is also about creativity. Produce is grown & harvested here and the animals are raised on the property. Nothing is wasted - everything has its place. It is a continuous cycle that occurs throughout the restaurant with, the kitchen, the animals and the gardens. The kitchen uses and savors every little piece. Seasonal to the moment, it is actually the farm and the garden that make the incredible ever-changing menu.\\n\\nWhat is not grown at the restaurant in Orlando comes from other local and sustainable farms that Chef Melissa Kelly is proud to support such as Mr. Dale Volkert from Lake Meadow Farms. From local cage free eggs to vegetables, fruits, and herbs, Dale sources most if not all of the fine dining and local Central Florida restaurants.\\n\\nChef Mariano Vegel, Chef de Cuisine at Primo, a transplant from Argentina, grew up cooking in his grandfather's pizzeria and making fresh pasta from scratch for family dinners. Today the dynamic duo bring a thrilling marriage of Mediterrean flavors to Primo's patrons at the JW Marriott, Grand Lakes.\\n\\nSlow Cooked & Grilled Octopus - lima beans, artichokes, calabrian pesto, ndujo sausage, smoky potato chips. When octopus is slowly simmered, it becomes delicate and tender. Finished on the grill, it imparts deeply satisfying layered flavors. \\n\\nCold Smoked Tuna Tartare with tonnato sauce, confit tomatoes, mint, sesame oil, bottarga, and crispbreads. Shimmering, perfectly diced house smoked tuna, creamy tuna sauce, Mediterranean caviar - need I say more?\\n\\nFarmer Salad: Primo lettuces, garlicky levain croutons, house cured bacon, soft poached Whisper Creek Farm egg, white balsamic vinaigrette. House cured crunchy bacon, perfectly poached egg, lettuce from the organic garden, dressed and dusted with white balsamic vinaigrette and Parmesan Reggianno shavings - each component was in perfect harmony. I could eat it as an entire meal.\\n\\nWe also got treated to Surplus Extra Pale Ale, flagship beer at The Brewery located here at Grande Lakes. This unique beer is brewed with the \\"Surplus\\" honey\\" from the farm here at Grande Lakes.\\n\\nThe best was yet to come....Squid Ink Linguine with 'Fruitti di Mare' - calamari, jonh crab, rock shrimp, clams, charred peppers, tasso ham, pimenton crumbs. Fresh squid ink pasta, uni emulsion, mind blowing array of seafood - this gorgeous dish is a seafood lover's dream, leaving you desperate for more. And that my friends is a good thing!\\n\\nSaltimbocca meaning \\"jumping in the mouth\\" in Italian, is a staple at Primo and Chef Kelly's to-go comfort dish. Saut√©ed Scaloppine of Pork Saltimbocca: in a sage infused mushroom-madeira jus with prosciutto, spinach and roasted garlic mashed potato.\\n\\nAn a fine finish to our decadent and fresh meal was the quintessential Italian refreshing gelatto - Caramello: caramel pate choux, caramelized hazelnut gelatto, toasted caramelized marshmallow.\\n\\nPlayful in presentation and pure in flavors, I will bow down to a double shot espresso please.\\n\\nWhisper Creek Farm - a 7,000-square-foot fruit and vegetable garden with an adjoining 11,000-square-foot outdoor event space. Whisper Creek Farm boasts a chicken coop, composting area, 120 pineapple plants, eighteen seven-foot citrus trees, including tangerine, kaffir lime, and kumquat; cucumbers, acorn squash, collard greens, avocado, mango, sweet potatoes, a variety of herbs, a pumpkin patch, and much more. In addition to the vast garden, Whisper Creek hosts resident bees in three hives to help in the pollination of the flowering plants and provide more of the Grande Lakes signature nectar.\\n\\nDid you know you can HOST your very own party at the stunning grounds of Whisper Creek Farm?\\n\\nEven before you depart from Primo, you will be making reservations for your next trip. Yeah! its that good!\\n\\nWhen food is treated with the respect it so richly deserves, it becomes a way of life. Chef Kelly's emphasis on freshness, seasonality, and a menu that accommodates what is coming out of the garden on a daily basis is a full circle farm to table experience."},{"name":"Salvatore's La Spaghetteria","address":"232 Sixth Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for my bday.

It sounded great but did not meet my expectations.  Basically I paid $9 for a steamed zucchini swimming in a boring tomato sauce covered in corn, cheese and salsa with a side of bland beans and rice. My boyfriend ordered the ceviche.  I took one bite and almost gagged at the overwhelming fishiness.  I don't understand why Talapia has run so rampant.  It's awful!  So what do you do when your food is unappetizing?  When we explained to the server that we didn't care for it and couldn't eat anything else because he had lost his appetite.  He said he would take it off the bill and took it back to the kitchen.  When he returned he started an argument that the fish was good and the owner said it might have too much oregano in it.  First of all, since when do you put oregano in ceviche? Second, is it ever appropriate for a server to argue with a guest?

Service was quite friendly, very efficient and attentive.  The tempura appetizer was served piping hot with a light batter and a gingery dipping sauce. Definitely recommend that you begin your meal with it.  Unfortunately the gyoza was over cooked and the filling was a bit dry.  Onto the sushi-fresh and very flavorful.  We had spicy tuna wrapped in avocado, shrimp tempura topped with torched tuna and eel sauce with spicy mayo, and Hollywood scallop roll. All were very pleasing and tasty.

I love that name! Harlow, old hollywood. We give it 3.5 stars to be exact.  Not a 4 star. Sorry.  The space is cute and it is as another reviewer mentioned, like crate and barrel magazine.  Farm tables and distressed painted chairs in white and pastel. Big tables and little tables.  They don't feature full service so it is set up like a deli where you have to place the order, take a number and a food runner brings it out to the patron.  We went on labor day eve so there was no wait. The deli/restaurant was only 40% capacity. When we placed our order and took our number and then set fourth to find a table, we could not find one that did not have food scraps on the table.  We ended up sitting at a table that was meant for 4 because the tables meant for 2 were dirty.  Later I noted how staff would bus the tables but would not wipe them down after taking away the plates.  We waited about 30 minutes for our meal to arrive.  The table who arrived after us got served their food before we did.  I was beginning to think that they forgot about us. Then our food came out.  It was not hot, but as I suspect just heated up a little.  The mac and cheese was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  We both really liked the chili and would probably order that again.  The corn bread muffin was good but fell a little flat of expectation. It was not served with butter or honey. The Mr. ordered palomino  plate which is 3 tacos with quinoa, stewed black beans & corn, roasted yams, shredded spinach, pineapple habenero sauce, cilantro and lime, served with a side of guacamole.  A humdrum of flavors. The tacos made with soft-shell corn tortillas were very messy.  I liked the coconut hot cider. As another reviewer commented, the after shock of the meal was an evening and morning of duvet lifters. This was also true from this reviewers point of well, I will leave you to do a web search for that term. The whole meal my husband reminded me that I can do so much better at our home kitchen.  As per my fellow reviewers on yelp that gave it 5 star reviews, do you think I went at the wrong time and just maybe this place is better for brunch? I can't imagine standing in line for it.

The food continues to be very good, from soup to sandwiches to warm entrees. I've never had a bad meal here and the service is very friendly. The prices are a little pricier than you'd think for a lunch. I've never had their dinner as I feel like for the price, it would need to be a special occasion.

Ok, PSA over. On to the good stuff.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I met up with two other couples on a Saturday night for dinner before a movie. Since Canton Cook II is right around the corner from our friend's house, they suggested it, and we readily agreed. I'm always up for a new restaurant.\\n\\nCanton Cook II is just like it's sister restaurant, Canton Cooks, which happens to be just up the road. This iteration is over in a strip mall featuring Nori Nori, an Italian restaurant, a liquor store, an LA Fitness and the other random assortment usually found there.\\n\\nInside, it also closely resembles the other restaurant as well: big tables with white table cloths and lazy susans in the middle for sharing dishes-family style, warm-lighting, a fish tank with live seafood, and the expected slightly-cheesy decor typical of these Chinese places. \\n\\nWe got there about 7 PM and it was busy, but luckily our friends had beat us there and secured a table. The waitress brought out tea after serving everyone with water, and we set to work poring over the extensive menu that spans several pages. It's chock full of all types of dishes (with no descriptions, as per usual): appetizers, soups, chicken, seafood, steak, pork, noodles, etc. The usual suspects are on there, but Canton Cooks II also caters to a more authentic clientele as well, so some more exotic (and less appetizing-sounding) dishes are also available.\\n\\nFinally, our group came to decisions and happily agreed to share what everyone ordered. We got: crab rangoon as an appetizer, barbecue pork with vegetables, garlic chicken, sar cha beef, beef chow mein noodles, a seafood noodle soup and shrimp with lobster sauce. And as I said, there was a lot of food. \\n\\nThe crab rangoon was typically devoid of crab, but was still good nonetheless - how wrong can you really go with fried cream cheese after all? Each of the dishes was tasty as well - I particularly enjoyed the garlic chicken, barbecue pork and sar cha beef, but really, there wasn't a bad dish in the bunch. Lots of veggies, lots of meat, lots of sauce - we all stuffed ourselves and still had leftovers. \\n\\nPrices were reasonable as well - the majority of dishes ranged between $9 - $13, I believe and tea was complimentary. Our waitress did a good job of making sure everyone was taken care of and splitting up our bills by couple at the end of the night too. It was definitely a good experience and I'd go back in the future. Next time, I might split a dish though, or be prepared to take home leftovers."},{"name":"Enigma Restaurant","address":"4397 10th Avenue W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"My experience in this Restaurant was Great.

The table bread was really dry and tasted old but the pickles and pickled carrots were a nice touch.  The steak pie had great flavor (close to too salty but not quite over the edge).  The gravy was very thin but we liked the taste so much we didn't care.  However, the steak while tasty was very tough which was disappointing.  The burger was cooked well and really good.  We found the bun pretty plain and it was crumbly (again probably not fresh bread).  The big issue was the fries. They were large hand cut but not crispy and definitely not cooked all the way through. Fries should not be firm in the middle so that was disappointing.  Our service was good, the drinks were good, and the atmosphere was really good.

I've only ever NOT left a tip twice and the service at Seaport was so unbelievably bad that we left, sans tip.\\n\\nWe went as a group of four a little after the lunch rush in the hopes of a quick meal.  There were very few people there and we sat inside.  The place itself looked somewhat cute, but wasn't all that spectacular.  Our waitress had two tables with people, including us (and the other table had left by the time we got past our appetizers).  We ordered apps, soups, and entrees.  It started to fall apart after we ordered our sodas.\\n\\nIt took 10 minutes to get our drinks, no exageration.  Once we got our drinks (no straws or sweeteners for iced tea despite our request) our waitress disappeared.  About 10 minutes after this she reappeared with the apps, still no sweetener.  The food was fine.  I don't even recall what we ordered for apps as it wasn't all that great.  The waitress then disappeared again, presumably for sweetener.  By this time we'd finished our drinks.  About 15 minutes goes by and she returns and we flag her down for refills...still no sweetener.  In the meantime a few other waitstaff walk right by our table and never offer to remove the dishes, refill our sodas, anything.\\n\\nThe soup was MUCH better.  French Onion soup, piping hot and dripping with cheese.  By the time our refill of drinks came we were done with the soups.  Still no sweetener.  At this point those with iced tea gave up and asked for different drinks.\\n\\nThe entrees took another 15 minutes to arrive and we were getting more than upset at this time.  Sitting at  a table with friends is nice but not when you've spent the better part of an hour waiting for food and drinks.  The entrees finally arrived with the exception of mine.  We had ordered a pasta dish, a chicken dish and two barbeque cheeseburgers.  We got our order with one less cheeseburger.  Now, this is where I don't understand how she could have gotten it wrong.  She came over and handed everyone their dish and walked away.  I sat there waiting.  I had assumed it was because she was about to bring it over, but no.  I had to wait another 5 minutes before she surfaced again so I could alert her to my lack of food and she seemed truly shocked that there wasn't a dish in front of me and then admitted, laughing, that she had forgotten to write it down.  She ran to the back and within about 10 minutes she brought out another burger for me.  \\n\\nThe food was good, the burger was tasty and everyone enjoyed their dishes.  Then we waited for the check.  And waited.  We had still not seen our waitress since she delivered my very late meal.  Finally, about 15 additional minutes after we had all finished eating I grabbed another waitress and asked for our check.  Our original waitress showed up with a big smile on her face and the check....without a single mention of all the screw ups, the wait, or even the tiniest deduction for our troubles.  Not even free soda.  \\n\\nA bad experience can happen to any waitress.  I've had them myself, though usually during a huge rush and I've never missed an entree.... but when you have two tables, two....and its not busy in the slightest....that is truly unacceptable.

The drinks came in mason jars, which was cute but a tad overdone. The pulled pork was slightly dry, but pretty good nonetheless. It only came with one slice of white bread, leaving me to figure out how to tackle the remaining mound of meat. The 'great northern brisket' beef was almost completely fat. The sides were kind of meh - the baked beans were fine, and my macaroni and cheese tasted as if it was made with Velveeta.

We used their app to be put on the wait list (60 minute wait) so by the time we got to the restaurant we only had a 5 minute wait. I liked the atmosphere of the place but that ended up being the highlight. When we were seated the host suggested the Brisket Burger or the Club. He said the Brisket Burger was huge, about 3/4 of a pound and with all the other toppings it was almost a full pound. \\n\\nSo our server arrived and asked about drinks. I ordered one of their in house made beers only to be told they were all out of that one. No big deal so I ordered an iced tea instead. After a few minutes he came back to take our order. I decided to take the hosts suggestion and ordered the brisket burger, my daughter ordered the roast beef dip and my wife was trying to decide between the brisket burger and the balsamic chicken. The server asked how hungry she was and that the brisket burger was a lot of food. She opted for the chicken but upon hearing this I was getting excited to see this thing. \\n\\nWhen they brought the food out (by a runner) my burger was the size of a something from the dollar menu at McDonalds but on a huge bun. After I looked at this I motioned for the server and asked what was the deal that this pathetic piece of meat wasn't anywhere close to what both he and the host described. With out saying a word, he took it away. I thought he was going to reorder it and that somebody just screwed up in the kitchen. \\n\\nA few minutes later another person (I am assuming he was a manager) came to the table and informed us that their burgers are a 5 ounce pattie. That is a big difference from 3/4 pound that the host said actually it is nearly a half pound of difference. What really took the cake was when he asked if I wanted to order something else or if I was set. WTF, I waited an hour before getting there, then when they brought out the food I didn't take the first bite and now your asking if I am all set. By this point I was starved. \\n\\nSo he brought back a menu and I quickly decided on the Texas fried steak. He took my order and 10 minutes later my dinner was served. Of course my wife and daughter had finished their meals by now. I don't know if this was their normal meat or they just pulled the worst chunk they had for a customer that already had complained but this was tough, gristly and had almost no flavor. I didn't want to wait again so I decided to just deal with it and cut around the inedible parts. I guess that was a good plan since the server never bothered to come back to ask how my dinner was. \\n\\nHe brought the check and while I wasn't looking for a comp or discount etc, I would have thought an apology or at least acknowledgment of the situation was in order.

Let me start of by saying that the demographics of the restaurant was quiet obvious (FYI we were the only three black people in there that Friday night). Aside from that the food was overall quiet good in my opinion. We had gotten the Fat Cheeks tray consisting of three meats (we went with pulled chicken, brisket, and sausage) our hot side was the mac and cheese (because mac and cheese is love) and the cold side was the farm salad and we also got the bucket of biscuits. \\n\\nTo start with the biscuits they were massive and so soft. They came with a honey butter which I wish there was more of because by the end of the night I was scrapping the darn thing. The brisket was good and not dry at all and the pulled chicken was pretty yummy too. I didn't eat the sausage just because I'm not a fan. The farm salad was good and I liked the fact that it was made of Brussels sprouts. I like to think of myself as a mac and cheese connoisseur and if I do say so myself that mac and cheese was amazing. If I'm correct the crust was made from oyster crackers and topped it off perfectly. Lastly for dessert we got the mixed berry short cake which came on a cinnamon sugar biscuit instead of an actual shortcake. The berries were fresh and the cream topping tasted like it was made freshly with love.

We are food snobs looking for straight-up real food, and aren't put off by ordering at the counter and having servers set out food down at the table when ready. Having worked in food service myself, I recognize that counter tips are generally split between all employees throughout the house. Tips are what make for a living wage for food service employees. The food is always delicious, a little surprising, and nobody cares when our daughter gets a little fussy. We're old & boring, so hipster-watching (which comes with Hawthorne territory) is usually pretty fun for us. Bistro seating is enjoyable too...because though we're old and boring, we do like the social atmosphere...we're \\"friendly\\" old & boring. If our neighbors indicate they want to be left alone - we do. If our neighbors are open to chit-chat, we chat it up.

The main cavernous warehouse-like space is subdivided into two separate bar areas, with an outdoor garden.  Casual and low-key, but convivial and loud as it fills up.  Besides the bar, there are picnic-style communal tables and benches.

But they also have various eggs benedicts, and steak (which comes as an alternative to standard bacon or sausage with their eggs meals), an ethnic breakfast (I'm remembering pita and olives but there was definitely other stuff), and some good specials (they change often...last time, I overheard the owner telling someone they were out of salmon, but that they had some fresh tilapia).\\n\\nThe thing with this place is that they put their own spin on it. Your home fries definitely didn't come out of a bag. There's always a ton of fresh grilled veggies in them and they are pretty flavorful. The whole plate is just always flavorful.

Homemade raspberry jam that we're pretty sure has chunks of pineapple in it. If your meal doesn't come with toast, order a side of toast (which they butter for you!) and jam because it is that good.\\n\\nAlso, they have homemade hot sauce. I'm not a fan of spice but I am a foodie so I tried a little. It packed a nice little kick and was just so \\"fresh\\" is the word we kept throwing around.

Anyways, it's good.\\n\\nA few minor annoyances which mean I can't grant that last star: 1, the homefries aren't to die for. They're good but just that. 2, the first omelet I ordered was a Western omelet and was not supposed to have sausage in it, but it did, as did my friend's omelet that wasn't supposed to have it either. They're kind of all over the place throwing things in your plate that aren't supposed to be there, it seems. Which is fine for the homefries, there's no definition of homefries. But she told me what was in the Western, and sausage was not in her description. 3, the fans are not AC and I am always too hot in there (although it is summer). 4, the service can be off if it's too crowded (we literally spent 5 minutes staring at anyone who works there and could not get any of their attention).

Our waiter James was friendly and engaging, and gave descriptions of the food that were nearly as mouthwatering as the meal itself! He knew the menu back to front, and highly recommended the burrata starter and the pork tenderloin entree, both of which were absolutely to die for. The burrata came with an incredible delicate brown butter sauce that was nutty and rich and a perfect complement to the creaminess of the cheese. The pork tenderloin was exquisite - cooked sous vide, and seared slightly, and just melt-in-your-mouth tender. The pork came with a cauliflower au gratin, which had nutty wild rice and an incredible pecorino to boot. Just fabulous! The desserts were great as well - a peppermint creme br√ªl√©e and a super boozy eggnog semi-freddo! Wow. And best of all, we got to chat with Don, the executive chef throughout the meal, and he told us all about the dishes we ordered, and some of the other incredible events Copious has to offer.

The Atrium was beautifully decorated and we had a wonderful early Christmas dinner at Villa di Flora. Further, this two-star review has nothing to do with the waitstaff as they did a fine job as well. \\n\\nOur issue is with the quality and quantity of what we ordered for the price that we were charged. We began our meal with the seafood tower which was beyond sad. The menu states \\"lobster tails\\" (which were more like lobster chunks than tails), \\"Fresh Oysters\\" (which were pretty tiny and detached from the shell...leaving us question how 'fresh' they truly were), and \\"Tiger Shrimp\\" (the only redeeming part of the platter). For a table of six, you get one of each offering for each person at the table for the steep price of $120. This was especially grating in light of the Christmas Buffet at Villa di Flora where for a little more than half the price you could recreate the seafood platter except the Oysters were twice the size and far fresher at Villa di Flora. \\n\\nFor a second small course we split a cheese platter which was fine, in fact for the price I would have gotten the cheese platter multiple times over compared to the seafood platter. \\n\\nWhen our mains arrived, the disappointment continued. My lamb and my husband's porterhouse were both overcooked (we ordered med-rare). If you are going to charge prices as if you are a nice steakhouse, then the kitchen should act like it (pro-tip, you can always cook something more...but you can't un-cook it). The meats were just slapped sadly on a white plate. No accouterments were offered, we had to ask (like mint jelly for the lamb, which is pretty standard). \\n\\nOverall, my suggestion would be to stick to MOOR or Villa di Flora if you are looking for a nicer Christmas Eve experience at Gaylord Palms. As I mentioned before this is not a service problem, this is a kitchen problem. Our server and bartender were very attentive and nice."},{"name":"Goldbergs Fine Foods - Toco Hills","address":"3003 N Druid Hills Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Goldbergs is a toco hills/druid hills staple.

I took someone that I knew and haven't spoken to in a while to this place so we could catch up. Initially our plan was to eat at some seafood restaurant at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. Instead, we decided to do something different at the last minute. I asked her if she wanted to eat some Spanish tapas, and she was open to the idea. We went on a Tuesday night, when it was moderately busy. \\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of tapas and medium dishes. Here is what we ordered:\\n\\nPatatas Bravas - Fried potato cubes with a spicy tomato sauce and garlic aioli.\\nCalamares Fritos - Fried Calamari with a sauce supposedly from Andalucia, which is a region in Southern Spain. \\nFideos con mariscos - This is a linguine pasta dish with two pieces of mussels and some various seafood like calamari and salmon. It is doused in a white wine sauce.\\nSolomillo - This is a small filet mignon steak served in a red wine sauce and mushrooms. Comes with some fries. \\nConfit de Pato - This is a roasted duck leg served over braised red cabbage and apples. \\nAt√∫n salteado - Pan seared yellow fin tuna over mixed beans with a dijon aioli sauce.\\n\\nThe bread was okay, but was really tasty, thanks to the hummus spread. It was also a great scrubber for leftover sauce on the tapas dishes.\\n\\nThe tuna dish was decent, liked the sauce and the mixed beans. The filet mignon was also decently good. Nice and juicy, but I thought they put in too much sauce. The fries were very ordinary fries, but had that that crispiness and softness that make fries addicting to eat. The linguine was pretty tasty, liked the creaminess of the sauce and I think I could taste the freshness of the cooked mussels. The Patatas Bravas were soft and chewy and lacked the crispiness on the outside. However, I loved the spiced tomato sauce mixed with the garlic aioli and that made the potatoes tastier and almost addicting to eat.\\n\\nThe roasted duck was probably one of the best duck meats I have eaten in my life. The meat was juicy, not dry and delicious. The red cabbage served as a great garnish for the duck. The calamari was excellent. Nice and crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside, making easy, not rough to chew. \\n\\nService was decent, the lady who served us was really nice and pretty cute. The food came in pretty quick for a sit down restaurant. The seats were really comfortable and I liked the Spanish atmosphere and decor.\\n\\nMy companion really liked the style of the food and atmosphere and said to me that she was open to coming back here if they served brunch. She ordered an iced tea and thought it was good. She also said to me that it reminded her of Chinese dim sum, mainly due to the fact that dim sum and tapas are served in small plates. \\n\\nOverall I thought I had a great and delicious dinner without having to go far from my apartment and I would not mind coming back here again. I believe this place is another great choice to get some tasty Spanish tapas in Boston."},{"name":"Sushi Tomi","address":"8463 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"l have been hearing about this place for a while.

It appeared only one gentleman was handling the service amongst this half of the dining room and because of that, service was a bit slow. Having been in the food industry business myself, and seeing the size of the clientele he had to manage, I sympathized with him, but it was tough at the same time because my patience could only hold for a certain amount of time. None the less, he was generous and apologetic when we asked more than twice for a new set of chop sticks. The food was up to par. The menu provides multiple options for various types of noodles from thin to thick, and with an extra charge, udon and others as well. I also asked for an additional side of noodles that was presented to me in a soup form having garnished it and everything as well. That was plesant as I'm used to a ha d full of noodles being stuffed into a bowl when asking for extra noodles at another ramen establishment. We also ordered BBQ wings and appreciated the light crunch the chicken had to the skin.

My husband and I were sat promptly upon arriving.  We requested to sit inside since it was a very balmy night, but their outside areas are lovely and in decent weather, make for a much nicer dining experience. The inside was a little too bright for dinner (which made the wear and tear on the booths more obvious), and the wall decorations a little cheesy.  \\n\\nOur server was friendly and attentive, but she spoke quietly and was dressed rather casually for waiting tables at a restaurant with entrees in the $25 - $35 range.  So, I guess I've already expressed the one negative about this restaurant - when your bill for two is close to $150, you sort of expect the experience to match the price, and cheesy wall decor and servers wearing torn up Converses don't help create that sort of experience.\\n\\nAnyway, the food did not disappoint.

Ham croquette with a apple aioli sauce (starter), Salmon tortilla (starter), Lamb (entree), vegetable paella (entree), dessert tapas that included 3 samplers (brownie, tiramisu and flan).  Tapas included chicken croquette with a delicious creamy mushroom sauce, duck confit and a chicken skewer. \\n\\nSeriously, everything (minus the skewer) was awesome. The duck fell of the bone, the creamy sauce with the chicken croquette was beyond delicious. By the time we made it to the entree we had to get most of it to go to save room for the desert. Note: I ate the paella the next day and it was also very flavorful and tasty.\\n\\nI had a lovely rose' that was under $7 a glass. The service was excellent and the food came out surprisingly fast. The ONLY con is finding parking but see the tip at the beginning. Most of reviews note it as being cozy and romantic, very true. Still good for groups but this is great for date night.

I figured it'd a be a great way to discover a new place in our new neighborhood. \\n\\n I read the reviews and took them into account, but chose to go into my experience with an open mind. Hoping that the nay sayers were just jerks who like to complain. \\n\\nWe went at 7:30 on a Wednesday night. The place had maybe three or four tables full, about what you'd expect for a Wednesday night. We had a reservation were seated promptly, and given water. The hostess asked if we wanted drinks when we sat down, and we said no. We watched two waiters walk by a couple of times, finally our waiter approached our table. He asked if we wanted drinks, we again declined. We took the chance to order the mussels as an appetizer, and ask for some bread. Our waiter was nice, but he seemed very nervous stuttering and fidgeting while talking with us. We promptly got our bread. The bread was delicious spongy and fresh served with olive oil, but the service was Sloooooooow. \\n\\nOur Mussels came out about twenty minutes later, and we were able to order our entrees. I ordered the short rib ragu with Paparadelle, and my boyfriend ordered a seafood saute. \\n\\nI will say the spicy tomato broth that the mussels came in was TO DIE FOR, it was fresh and smooth with just the right amount of garlic and spice. However, it took us a couple of bites to realize that the mussels had turned. There was a fishy smell, and they tasted off. After a few minutes the fishy smell was so strong it was making me nauseous, I had to go wash my hands to get the smell off. But the sauce was so good we put the mussels in the discard bowl, and dipped our bread in the sauce. About 20 minutes after receiving our appetizer the hostess came over to check how things were. We let her know that the broth was delicious, but the mussels were off. She looked at the discard bowl quizzically, as I realize it appeared we'd eaten them. She then took them away and said she was sorry. After taking the offending mussels away, no one came back to our table to apologize or even to check on us. \\n\\nOur entrees arrived after another 20 minutes of waiting, and eating more bread. They did keep the bread coming. Again, the sauce was great. My short rib ragu was amazing the flavors were just so savory and delicious, but the pasta tasted like it had been cooked then left out. It had that almost hard chewy texture. I did eat all of my pasta as the sauce was so good I was able to disregard the pasta, and view it purely as a vehicle for my sauce. My boyfriend was pleased with his seafood saute, however he was cautious after what had happened with the mussels. He felt the sauce could have used more flavor. \\n\\nWe finished our food and then came time for the check. We waited for what seemed like an eternity for the waiter to come over. We then asked for the check and gave him the coupon. He disappeared for 10 to 15 minutes and then came back with the check. We mentioned that the mussels had been rotten as they were still on the bill. He went to the kitchen and stated that he couldn't help as they were already gone. I told him that we'd mentioned the mussels to the hostess as well, he left again to do god knows what. \\n\\nHe finally returned after another 15 minutes with the bill, and the mussels were no longer on the bill. We gave him our card, and he disappeared again for a significant time before returning with the slip for signing. \\n\\nWe felt bad as he'd helped us out by taking the mussels off the bill, he really was very nice. But, he'd been so damn slow that we gave him a less than 15% tip. All told we were there for about an hour and a half from start to finish. \\n\\nI would not go back.

The restaurant itself was nice - much brighter than the previous Sel de la Terre, the bar booth was comfortable and the decor was clean - felt like something out of HGTV.  The service was excellent.  Of course it wasn't that busy - only 1 other party in the bar and maybe 5 parties in the main restaurant...but we received water and bread within a few minutes of sitting.  We both ordered the yellow tomato bisque ($6) which was amazing!  Think creamy tomato soup but a little sweeter because it is made with yellow tomatoes.  We shared the margarita pizzetta ($13) which was yummy!  10-inch thin crust pizza made with fresh yellow tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.  The yellow tomatoes were a surprise.  For my taste the crust could've been a little crispier but overall the flavor was good.  The rest of the menu looked delicious and I will definitely plan coming back for dinner.

While not New York style, they are perfect in their own right. \\n\\nOf course there's also coffee and a small but nice tea menu. They make a mean London Fog and dare I say I don't think I've ever tried their Chai? The nice thing about their London Fog is that they make their own tea blend and leave the giant mesh bag in the cup, so you can decide when to remove it and what tastes best to you. \\n\\nThis is a must stop breakfast/coffee spot in the Beaverton area."},{"name":"Maher's Restaurant & Pub","address":"352 B Ave","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't go here! \\n\\nThe Guinness was flat and the chicken-curry looked and tasted like vomit. \\n\\nThey are severely understaffed.

No positives at all."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Bottom line: Tasca has been my favorite restaurant for five years, and after tonight, I will not be going back. \\n\\nIt truly breaks my heart to have to write this review. For years, I have loved Tasca. When my father came to town, this is where I took him to show him what the east coast had to offer. When my girlfriend and I moved into the neighborhood, we were so excited to have a local restaurant around the corner where we could have a nice meal without having to venture downtown. \\n\\nBut that was then, and this is now. Tasca has steadily gone downhill. At first, I thought it was a fluke. Just a one time not as great as before meal. My girlfriend's favorite dinner, the smoked salmon on a potato cake, wasn't as good. It's never been my favorite, so maybe I didn't notice the decline at first. But from then on it each meal we had there seemed to get steadily worse, with plates being served cold or over cooked and that spicy flavor fading in some of their dishes. \\n\\nBut tonight was by far the worst meal we have ever had. Let me start by saying the food was mediocre at best. What used to be my favorite dish in the world, the mushrooms in sherry sauce, was cold with either stale bread or toasted bread that was cold, I'm not sure which. The same could be said of sausage dish, which was served with lukewarm onions in the middle. \\n\\nBut what made the experience the worst we have ever had was the service tonight.  \\n\\nWe sat down, on a rocking table. The hostess seemed to watch us struggle and try to make it stable, but did nothing but stand there holding our menus. Eventually we were all situated, menus in hand. After a few minutes, our waiter came up. We ordered our food, five tapas, and then waited. \\n\\nI know with tapas style food, it generally comes in waves. We were fine with that, and our first three dishes arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I should note they were brought out by someone other than our waiter. We ate them leisurely, and finished them. And then waited - we still had two more tapas coming our way. And eventually, nearly 30 minutes after we had finished our food, our waiter came by to take away our empty plates. I'd like to point out that this was nearly 50ish minutes after he had last come to our table - in that time, no one had refilled our water, taken away our finished plates, or asked how we were doing. What is more insulting is that he seemed to go out of his way to ask the diners next to us how they were doing. He then said he would bring the bill, but I had to remind him we still had two other things coming. At this point it was clear he had forgotten them. We asked since he had not put them in, if we could go ahead only get one of the dishes since after waiting, we weren't all that hungry. \\n\\nAfter we got our last plate, we asked if we could get the chocolate cake for dessert but wrapped up to go, and a refill on our water while we waited for the bill. We had a Groupon and needed to hit the $30 minimum, but quite frankly did not want to sit for the amount of time I can only guess it would take to get cake and then the bill. It didn't really matter because 15 minutes later our cake arrived, on a plate. When I mentioned that we had asked for it go, he sighed heavily and took it away. \\n\\nWhen our bill did finally arrive, the tapa we had canceled was still on there. It took a mere 10 minutes to get our waiter to come back to our table, and then another 10 minutes to get final check signed and completed. \\n\\nI believe that if you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to dine out. But when you have not great food and bad service, what do you do? For me, it was tip way less than 20%, that's for damn sure."},{"name":"Sabatino's","address":"895 Main St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"3","text":"We've eaten there a few times and the food has been good.

We could go a lot more than that, but it is one of those places that is so special that we want to savor it--we don't want it to ever feel routine or ordinary.\\n\\nThe burger, two years later, is still the best on the planet. We took my parents there recently for the first time, and they agreed. So, picture it: four people, all eating burgers with their eyes closed, going.... yummmmmm. Because it is that good. I am glad to be able to report this to you; sometimes good things don't stay good, but this is not the case here, thank goodness.\\n\\nAnother thing you need to know is that the burger is a mere $8.00 at happy hour. Yes, you have to sit at the bar, but we've discovered that's half the fun--watching your artisanal cocktail being made makes it taste extra awesome. Do be aware that the happy hour times are quite limited; as of this writing, happy hour is late night (10-11pm on Friday and Saturday), and early evening (from 5-6pm on Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday).\\n\\nAnother thing you need to know is that is that Yakuza is lovely in both dreary weather (when it's dark and cozy and candlelit) and in summer (when the garage doors are open and the breezes are fantastic, or you can sit in the cute minimalist garden).\\n\\nYou also need to know that the cocktails are worth every penny. After sampling most of the cocktail menu, our favorite is the Wasabi (Aviation Gin, Pacific Farms Fresh Wasabi, Lime, Cucumber), but the Pink Pepper (Aviation Gin, Pink Peppercorns, Grapefruit, Bitters, Lime, Beet (Beet Infused Monopolowa, Lime, Simple Syrup), and Really Spicy (Thai Chili Infused Monopolowa, Cilantro, Lime, Simple Syrup) are all lovely.\\n\\nFinally, you need to know that Yakuza is closed on Mondays. There's nothing more heartbreaking than deciding that today is going to be the day you are going to have a Yakuza burger, driving all the way up there and finding a parking place, only to notice that the windows are suspiciously dark... but you peer in anyway, because maybe it's just an illusion... but, no, it's not. They're closed.\\n\\nSo, there you have it: two years of awesomeness.

We wanted more (4 half slices) and were told it was $5.  We wanted it anyway.  I had read about their spaghetti being the food of choice so I wanted that.  It did not disappoint.  It was cooked al dente and was creamy and so flavorful.  It had what I call a \\"morish\\" (like in more) taste.  I just couldn't get enough.  And finally we had the Short rib Carnitas.

Almost makes you feel guilty for some of the pleasures you're about to enjoy.  Standard table dining and a sushi bar are off to the left - but you've more than likely come to partake of the \\"chef's table\\", where all of your meal is prepared before your very eyes by a highly-trained culinary artist.\\n\\nThough reservations aren't needed, you may find yourself waiting for a short period for your party to be seated (each table can accommodate up to 12 people) and that's a good time to belly up to the bar and order something that will carry you through until the chef shows up.  My favorite is the Scorpion bowl, which is a flaming drink.  Tip:  that's 151 causing your beverage to resemble a volcano.  If you want to see the end of your meal, douse the flames with liquid dripped from your straw and then siphon the fuel out and distribute it into the rest of your drink.  It's all in the pacing.\\n\\nUpon being seated, ginger salad and miso soup are served up - you can also order appetizers if you just can't wait any longer.  Choices on the entree menu include a number of combinations including chicken and shrimp, steak and shrimp, chicken, steak and lobster, etc.  This also comes with unlimited rice and noodles, plus copious amounts of veggies.\\n\\nThough the food is always very good, the presentation is only as good as your chef and I must say that we have our favorites as well as some others that we're not too thrilled with.  The best chefs are engaging, funny and expertly skilled with their twirling, whirling knives, spatulas and other implements.  Without giving too much away, they throw food and catch it in seemingly impossible ways, display amazing feats of efficient food processing, juggle, design and, of course, set things on fire (sometimes, apparently part of the schtick, themselves.)\\n\\nAll in all, it's a fun and tasty night out and if you don't have a take-home box for a delicious re-run in the morning, then you were one hungry cuss and will probably waddle all the back to wherever you are staying that night."},{"name":"Grand Central Baking Company","address":"2249 NW York St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Calamata Olive bread!

First, I arrived a few minutes before my party did and asked to be seated. Though it was 5 pm and the restaurant was virtually empty, the hostess would not seat me and suggested I sit on a chair by the wall. While I understand why restaurants are usually reluctant to seat people before their entire party is present,  in this case it felt rude and resulted in a very awkward situation where I sat alone on the wall very near the host's stand in the near-empty restaurant.  My girlfriend arrived to the still-empty restaurant about ten minutes later and we asked to be seated while we waited for the third and final member of our party. Even though the restaurant uses the same tables for parties of 2 or 3, the hostess still wouldn't seat us. I finally just said we would only be 2 so that we could get a table. When our other friend came in about ten minutes later, we asked about being moved to another table that seemed to be arranged to accommodate 3 people a bit better (not a differently sized table, just one in a less congested area of the restaurant). Our waiter told us we couldn't move there because that table would shortly be grouped with the ones near it to seat a very large party. It seemed to us just a short time later that this was just not true as the tables he had referenced were being used by separate groups that had rambled in after we asked about switching tables. It would have been fine if there were some legitimate reason for us not to use the table we had asked about, but why make up a story?\\n\\nAs for the food, my review must be mixed. The sauces left on the table were delicious, and the pineapple habanero had lots of kick. The fried ochra appetizer was really on point, but our main course came up lacking. The pork belly was extremely fatty, and I am not at all the type of guy who shies away from some fat on his meat. We had some pieces of brisket that were delicious, but a couple that were, again, comprised mostly of fat and largely inedible.  I thought the pulled chicken, on the other hand, was stellar. Great texture, perfect amount of saltiness, and the aforementioned sauces complimented it beautifully.  However, that (plus collard greens that were also very good) just could not offset the negative parts of our visit. Lastly,  my late-arriving friend wasn't given water until just before the end of our meal (I understand he was late, but I also think our waiter could have looked over at some point to figure this out) and my girlfriend and I also got our first and only refills at that same time.\\n\\nNext time we are in Fenway, we would likely try another spot before venturing back in here."},{"name":"Breakfast Table","address":"3014 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"4/5 Back in Vancouver for the week and we decided to try a new breakfast place.

To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan of this dish. There was some kind of miso glaze at the bottom that didn't really meld well with the coffee. It also didn't really strike me as a hash. Lastly, as much as I love fatty pork belly.... I don't really like eating a brick of fat. There was very very little meat and it didn't melt in your mouth either.... a fat brick. Probably should have said something but I don't like kicking up a fuss and we were deep in a conversation that I didn't want to interrupt.\\n\\nI give this place high ratings because the others seemed to like their dishes well enough and the coffee and service were good.

The food has always come quickly, too.\\n\\nThat being said, the crowds mean long waits to be seated during any time you'd think to go to a restaurant for brunch and the poor waitstaff seem in a constant panic to handle the full tables and booths.  I don't blame them; it's a difficult maneuvering job even to get to the restrooms because the place is so tightly packed full of people, it's hard not to trip over a celery stick.  And the food and drinks are just a LIIIIIITLE pricey for what they are, in my opinion.

I had actually set off to find an established coffee shop in which to do work on my computer, but the warm foreign charm of Ola's, and the full breakfast menu beckoned me in.\\n\\nI went inside and Gus, the owner and operator, was immediately accomodating, informing me that I could have anything I liked in my omelette- for no additional cost, if I remember correctly. He then waited patiently while I took what must've been a maddeningly long time to decide what I wanted. He kept up intermmitent eye contact, though, even when other customers weaved in for coffee and out with to-go cups. \\n\\nOnce I ordered, I asked if I could use my computer at one of his few small red tables by the window. He said \\"of course\\" and showed me where to plug it in, all while he made my omellette from scratch, and had its ingredients fresh on the grill, then in the oven. He brought it straight to my table, and it was DELICIOUS and hot (I don't normally even like omelettes!), and the coffee was good too.\\n\\nGus and I discussed things of the world and things of his life; he is a very friendly man. He told me his plans for the place- to expand to an outdoor seating area and more seating for bigger parties inside. He said that at the time, the business was new and he was thrilled by the challenge of making it work, but also unsure of how to get it off the ground. He does everything for the business: counter, cook, cashier, finances, management, marketing, etc.\\n\\nI was meeting my cousin Steveb later that day, and he is a die-hard fan of DIY breakfasts, so I asked him to meet me there. He did, and he was just as pleased with the decor, Gus's manners and charisma, and the food (an omelette he had made with egg whites instead)!\\n\\nI told Gus that I wanted to help him get more publicity for his business.

I braved a terrifying taxi ride from Government Center to get to Stephanie's at the concierge's suggestion and I can't tell you how romantic it was to have nearly the entire restaurant to ourselves...in the snow...in front of a warm fireplace. I ended up having scallops in a corn chowder (no longer on the menu, but if they ever have an entree with a chowder base, order it!) and it was probably THE SINGLE BEST MEAL I've ever had in my life, and at worst, top 5, easily.\\n\\nWith that said, the menu doesn't change much (although most everything is delicious so the old phrase, if it isn't broken, don't fix it seems to work!) and the desserts tend to leave something to be desired (although I may not be the best source about this since I'm not a huge dessert person). The brunch is one of the best on Newbury St, but I wouldn't say it's the best in Boston and when it's busy, I have a hard time hearing anyone who isn't seated directly next to me. \\n\\nThe people who work at Stephanie's, particularly the manager (i think her name is Maggie), are amazingly friendly and nice.

It took a good 5-10 minutes for someone to approach our table after being seated in the bar and take drinks, by which time we were ready to order (and were not allowed a chance to).  Give it another 5-10 minutes before the drink shows up and we order. After sitting for at least 25 minutes (the amount of time actually measured) we were finally told that the kitchen had screwed something up and it was still going to be more time.  Drink was gone by this point, and no offer for another or anything was presented.  Staff appeared more concerned with pretty much everything else in the building. Also asked for water on two different occaisions and didn't get any until the third time that we asked as our food arrived. .... The second time, when they told us the food was late, we asked for water and got a third basket of chips instead...  I've known Sandovals is a tad pricey as far as Mexican goes, but the food really wasn't that spectacular after the wait and the menu wasn't that exciting to choose from either.  Staff were friendly-ish, but that doesn't make a good restaurant experience.  \\n\\nBottom-line; food was too much for the quality and the service was absolutely awful. You usually go to Mexican expecting great, friendly service and a quick order up.  Its not that complex to cook, and this was a complete let down.

To be honest, if not for the groupon I probably wouldn't have ever known this place was here considering all the other options for Japanese / Sushi in the Coolidge Corner area.\\n\\nThe food is pretty good, but as others have said, the service isn't great.  Both times I've been here have been on weekend nights and the restaurant has been pretty busy when we walked in.  The restaurant is small, only about a dozen tables or so, but they could probably use more than 2 servers during peak hours.  Both times we've been here, we had to seat ourselves because because nobody greeted us at the door.\\n\\nThe Sushi is pretty good, although they have some strange rolls.  They have these rolls that are called monster rolls, which instead of being stacked, are rolled extra fat.  About twice the size of a normal roll in width, but not as thick in length, so instead of 6 or 8 normal sized rolls you get about 4 or 5 super wide rolls.  They are sort of cool, but difficult to eat due to their oddly shaped size.  They do have some very good and creative rolls like the spicy shrimp and fresh mango, and the king of California roll but to be honest I think you can find better quality and service elsewhere in the Coolidge Corner area for a comparable price.

This Toledo based restaurant is the only location in Columbus - the Crosswoods/Worthington location is no longer a valid franchisee of the Jed's enterprise. \\n\\nThe location is the former Damon's Sports Bar location - with a huge stadium area for dining and watching 4 big screens, a smaller but rousing bar, a second dining room with fireplace, and a large patio. \\n\\nFor service, I have to say Jed's is tops. The waitresses are friendly and take care of their patrons. They accommodated our large group each week, maybe even bringing in wait staff just for our party of 18 to 25 individuals. Separate checks were handled well. And you never had to wait too long for a refill or for another alcoholic beverage.  The manager was very present every night.\\n\\nThey have great specials for happy hours and late night (after 10). Food specials, beer specials....they have lots of beers available by bottle and quite a few on tap. They also have full bar cocktails.... \\n\\nThe menu itself is impressive to read - typical bar food - wings, burgers, sandwiches, fried pickles, onion rings. They also have \\"barbq\\" like shredded pork and ribs. The biggest notable item on the the menu is Jed's fireballs (everyone break out into spontaneous laughter). Yes Jed's specialty is their balls. The balls are really nothing more than a chunk of boneless chicken breast, lightly breaded, fried and tossed in a sauce of your choice (think wings sauce like hot, mild, garlic, etc. They also have some outrageous combinations where they add all sorts of toppings to the balls - like bbq pork, chili, cheese, cheese sauce, hot dogs, only Lord knows how many combinations you can come up with....and just to order balls, it's a joke that gets really old really quick..... \\n\\nBut I must tell you Jed's, although I love everything to this point - I think your food is THE WORST bar food being served in Columbus. I think I could get better bar food at any TGIFridays that may be still open. The food at \\"bw3\\" is probably marginally better than what your kitchen puts out. Let's face it - you aren't a barbq joint. Yeah you have ribs and pork bbq - but I've had better pulled pork at the Hilliard Dairy Queen. Your fries are limp. Your cole slaw is devoid of any flavor. Your entree salads look like crap, and they taste like it as well. A friend's salad came out and it looked like it had been salad shooted to DEATH, drenched in tasteless ranch dressing. Your wings are massively oversauced and so greasy - too much breading and saucing. The burgers appear to be unoffensive, and the BALLS - if you eat them with wing sauce and some blue cheese, it's probably the best thing on the menu. But that is not saying much..... \\n\\nI will go to Jed's to drink. I will avoid eating at Jed's at all costs, unless I have a fried pickle or an onion ring...those appear to be \\"ok\\". I wish I knew what the problem was - I really think it's rooted in your recipes...because your food was consistently awful over the 8 week period. \\n\\nIt pains me to give you 2 stars because I love the bar and the bar service....I just think any patron would be better served by eating elsewhere and coming to Jed's to drink. The execution of the menu doesn't cut it. \\n\\nService - 4 stars \\nAtmosphere - 5 stars \\nFood - ZERO stars"},{"name":"Rocco's Restaurant & Bar","address":"193 Main St","city":"Wilmington","stars":"3","text":"I am quickly becoming the torch carrier for good restaurants in the Burlington area.

Refreshingly hip menu that takes many old school ingredients, but done in a contemporary and creative way. We started with the fried oyster sliders, which were fresh and light (not heavy and greasy). The sauce in the slider gives a tangy balance to the rich oyster. Then we had the scallop dish and a lobster/mushroom pasta, with both being superbly executed. The sauces to the lobster pasta was rich, yet light, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The scallops were perfectly seared, on a bed of squash and greens. I cannot overemphasize the harmonious balance of fresh, complementary, yet disparate, ingredients and deep flavors, but also severe restraint from keeping each dish from being too heavy-handed and overwrought. One cannot help but appreciate the great sense of thoughtfulness, finesse, and ingenuity in the culinary craft, and it was well noted at our table and by the bustling crowd.

I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 yrs. and food used to be amazing. It used to be my favorite restaurant for Sichuan food. Past few years the food's been going downhill, but still good enough, until I ate there last night. \\n\\nSo, I went there around 7 pm and ordered about 5 or  6 dishes including their crab which I get most occasions. When the crab came out, it looked very small and didn't look right. So, I counted the legs and found 2 claws and 6 legs total. There were 2 legs missing. I don't even mind missing leg. As I tasted the crab, it didn't smell that fresh. I didn't want to make a big deal, and just ate it because I didn't want to embarrass my friend. In my mind I knew I got a dead crab that's been dead for awhile. Normally, they bring out the crab live on a pan for you to inspect and approve before cooking. This time they just brought out the cooked crab. Even if they bring it out live, I've seen restaurants change it in the kitchen. I knew 100% it wasn't the one in the tank as I eat tons of crab and I know by taste and texture. As matter of fact I looked at the tank and saw about 6 in there before. When I looked at the tank again it looked same as before, and I don't remember anything swishing around the tank as We were sitting 2 tables away. The meat was little mushy this time and off tasting. But anyhow I kept to myself. \\n\\nThe total bill was $148 with no drinks, which I expected. I went up to pay the bill, and asked the lady who I think is the owner, how much they charge for the crab. She said its $65, which was stated on the bill. So I asked her how much per pound? Which is how we're normally charged in Chinese restaurants. She said $65 for one any size, which doesn't make any sense. I told her the crab was very small and not fresh, hoping she caught on to what I was implying. She immediately walked into the kitchen, and I thought was going to talk to the chef, but when I sat back down at my table, she never came back. There was no sorry, or that crab is fresh because it was from tank, or anything. \\n\\nSo, at this point I'm getting more pissed off after bad crab. Normally I'm a generous tipper with good service or food, and still tip fair share even with bad food or service. This is the first time I didn't want to tip. So, I left $150 cash on the table and walked out hoping she would know why. \\n\\nSo, this next event is what prompted me to write a review. As we were walking to the car, I hear the owner calling us, and as I walked back toward her, she says \\"excuse me why didn't you leave a tip?\\"\\nNow, this really pissed me off even more. I explained to her about the crab in detail, and she never once defended anything about the crab and never a sorry about anything. I told her she served me a dead crab and walked away. \\n\\nThey want to rip me off on my meal, and chase me to parking lot to ask for tip????? PLEASE. HOW LOW CAN THEY GO?\\n\\nIf you ever eat here, make sure they bring out a live crab from tank to show you, so you can make sure you get the same crab when it's cooked and not switched in kitchen.

The way the tables are set up as well as the lighting make it easy to have a romantic dinner or simply feel some measure of privacy while you are eating.\\n\\nFood - This was the most disappointing part of my meal and the largest surprise. To make it clear, I AM a sushi snob. I've had it at the best places in LA, NY, Vegas, you name it and I know what I'm talking about. Anyway the sushi and sashimi was only somewhat above average.

I honestly felt as though I WERE back in Japan eating ramen at a proper ramen house. The d√©cor really fits with a traditional style and being magically transported to Hokkaido with a hot bowl of ramen and my hoji-cha was my favourite part about the experience. It tends to be crowded though, so while the staff is attentive, they are also busy and there is often a line, so be prepared to wait as long as 30 minutes for a table.\\n\\nFirst of all the portions are HUGE! They have a nice variety, but the real reason to come here are for the burnt onion and charcoal broth, which are each very unique and delicious. \\n\\nAlso, their chsh  is especially tasty (better quality & more flavour than most ramen/soupy noodle houses I've been to - including Samurai Noodle and many Chinese establishments that pride themselves on their pork) and their eggs are cooked to perfection (soft and golden without being runny and the flavor was well absorbed into the whites), the only downside for me is that their noodles are not as good as the ones at Samurai Noodle, which is what I am looking for in an authentic ramen house.

It seems kinda dumb to get a burger where you can get awesome Scottish food, but I can't help it, it's the best burger around.  The scotch egg is a must try, as well.  They also have cool Scottish ciders and beers, which go great with the food.  Second, Scottish people own and work there (not exclusively, but you always hear a Scottish accent!).  Everyone that works there is friendly and helpful.  I once made an OpenTable reservation for four, that somehow didn't get into their system.

Although my review was going to be positive anyway, the staff's extremely chill response to my accidental arson incident bumps it up from 4 stars to 5. \\n\\nI met up with some friends who were visiting from out-of-town, and since it was a weeknight and they were leaving the next day, we just wanted to do something low-key and relaxing. A hookah lounge sounded like the perfect venue. Bonus points that it's right next to a yummy Mediterranean place (Arpeggio Grill), and you can order next door and then have them bring the food over. (Note: neither place serves beer or wine, so if that's your poison, you may want to BYOB).\\n\\nThere are various little nooks for lounging -- some on couches, some on the floor, and since my friends and I had opted for the floor, we had to do some rearranging of pillows when the food arrived. I was trying to move a bean bag chair out of the way, and that's when I bumped the hookah and spilled hot coals right into the bean bag! Not good. Even worse when the hot coals burned /through/ the outer fabric and then were somewhere /inside/ the bean bag, still smoking but inaccessible. Thankfully, it seems that styrofoam peanuts aren't too combustible, because the whole thing didn't burst into flames like it would in a movie -- probably one with Ben Stiller trying to impress a date.\\n\\nThat's when one of the staff showed up to see what was the matter. I apologized profusely and explained what had happened, and he seemed totally unfazed. By this time, one of the coals had burned through to the other side, but there was still one unaccounted for. He took the bean bag and presumably hosed it down somewhere; at the very least I hope he didn't just stick it in the back with a bunch of flammables. Since I haven't seen any accounts of a fire sweeping through Yahala and Arpeggio Grill, I think I can rest easy that I haven't destroyed two great Austin institutions.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was thankfully accident-free. We enjoyed our hookah (Blue Mist Watermelon, I believe -- hints of blueberry, mint, and watermelon make for a refreshing combo), as well as some hot tea (which I didn't spill!), and the staff was as gracious and attentive as ever.

The interior feels new but strangely familiar with the standard Chinese restaurant decor. They have a really large menu with all the standards and many adventurous options which speak to the authenticity of the place. I look forward to coming back with a larger group to try much more, but today's mission was some good XLB. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we had some issues with the service. The server assigned to our table was sweet, but she did forget to put in our order. In fact, she came over after a while seeing that the tables around us had been served and asked us why we had no food in front of us. I said we were wondering the same thing! She went back and checked and realized she'd forgotten to put in the order. She apologized and we appreciated the honesty. We liked her. \\n\\nThe XLB was excellent. I appreciated the thin slice of yellow beet (I think?) at the bottom to keep the dumpling from sticking to the pot. The pork filling was plentiful. The sauce inside was great. The accompanying vinegar was nice, as well, although I'm used to a vinegar soy mixture. \\n\\nMy friend got some vegetarian steamed dumplings which neither of us liked at all. The server asked us later if we wanted a takeout box. We said no. She asked why. My friend hesitantly admitted we just didn't like them. The server just walked away. \\n\\nWe did, however, love the noodles with dried shrimp and scallions that we shared. They have so many different noodle options, all of them sounded great. The owner came out to make this recommendation so we went with his suggestion.  \\n\\nWe also had some garlic bok choy since they were out of gai lan. This was amazing, however the $13.99 price point didn't seem right since it was twice the price of everything else we ordered.

I had the spark plug seasonal sandwich and really enjoyed it; fresh ingredients and great bread."},{"name":"Shiraz Grill","address":"6427 Westwood Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Wanting to take a break from the chain restaurants of Orlando during a 5 day business conference, I was delighted to find a Persian restaurant within a short walk from the Hilton. Being from southern CA, I've had the pleasure of being exposed to delicious Persian cuisine so I thought I was gonna have a treat in Orlando. Sorry folks, this is not the case.\\nShiraz is a hidden eatery next to the Best Western. When I first got to the restaurant, I thought it was empty and actually feared it was closed because of the lack of patrons. I stumbled my way accidentally through the hookah lounge (a pretty standard room attempted to be in the decor of middle eastern design) and promptly escorted myself out. It was nothing special. \\nThe restaurant itself had the same theme as the lounge. I understood what they were going for in terms of ambiance, but the result was pretty standard ... Not bad, just kinda meh. As I entered, I saw that there were a couple customers tucked in the back but couldn't find an employee. I looked around the corner and made eye contact with a hostess(?) but she continued completing her task without any acknowledgement that she had a patron. Bad sign. Finally, a waitress spots me and she was actually very pleasant (a middle aged Caucasian woman). \\nThe meal started with warm pita (nice) served with some feta and butter. Pretty standard fare. I ordered the beef soltani, which included rice, a beef koobideh skewer, and grilled beef strip.  The service was pretty quick, but as others had commented, the portions are on the smaller side (which I didn't mind terribly) considering the price. I guess I'm used to the larger portions provided by the Persian restaurants I frequent in CA. From the look of the plate, I kind of anticipated disappointment with what I was about to eat. The rice was mostly just white with sparsely bits of yellow, as opposed to the rice with plentiful amounts of the spice (saffron?) that I'm used to seeing. The tomato was just every so slightly grilled... And I do mean ever so slightly because I almost thought it was just a half of a raw tomato. It looked almost par boiled, with the skin just barely getting wrinkly, but definitely no grill marks or char (which is what I love with the grilled tomatoes you usually get in Persian food). The beef skewer was on the svelte side and the beef strip looked a little anemic. I hoped that I would be proven wrong with the flavor after I took the first bite, but alas I was spot on, unfortunately. It was bland and I understood what some Yelpers alluded to with respect to a lack in Persian flavors. I piled on the sumac and made the best of it. It was by no means inedible, but it was disappointing. If you haven't had the more authentic fare, you may not notice the difference, but with the healthy Persian population in southern CA, I was spoiled and therefore the food did not compare. \\nThe final nail on the coffin was when the check came. Not only was the food on the expensive side, they added an 18% gratuity!  Huh?  I was dining alone!  I would have given at least 18% anyway since the wait staff was great, but to not even be given the option was disarming. This wasn't a good final impression and I will definitely not be returning."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Awesome!!!!!

Never having had shabu shabu before, we were relatively clueless. First, the young woman who seated us--the hostess, I think--thoroughly explained the menu and our choices. She was sooo helpful and friendly, and relaxed so that helped allay our fears of looking like idiots. Our waiter, too, went out of his way to make sure we knew what to do--how to mix the \\"condiments\\" into the soy sauce, for example. We ordered two broths, the Japanese curry and the kimchi broth. Both were delicious. We ordered the surf and turf combo, and were pleased to see a very nice array of clams, shrimp, squid, salmon, scallops, fish cake, and whitefish. The vegetables were good too; I especially enjoyed what I think was watercress, the spinach, and the wood ears. The potato and I think breadfruit were also delicious cooked in the broth. Things we didn't know that we realized partway through dinner (did I mention that we were clueless?): that the broth is meant not just for cooking, but also to be eaten. And it was delicious. And some ingredients take much, much longer to cook than others. One thing I was very grateful to the hostess for: she told us that one combo would be enough for two, along with our appetizers. The waiter, a young man with apparently has a much bigger appetite than I, thought it would not be enough. We followed the hostess's advice and shared 2 appetizers and a combo. If we had ordered more, we wouldn't have been able to finish it.

All were just okay, (as well as the service) definitely not worth the $40.00 price tag. Maybe $10- having said that, let me start over. \\nI chose to sit outside, as it was nice out. All the tables lining the perimeter or the yard had wasp/hornet catcher/trap things. The tables are bar high, and I'm short so no go for me as I did not feel like climbing up to eat lunch today. Besides, some of those traps were full, and a definite yuck, so I sat in the middle table seating, with the umbrellas. \\nMy food took longer than usual (I've been here several times before) , but I'm okay with that. My plate was sad looking. For $17, it had one roasted green onion, one roasted pasillo pepper, two cardboard thin \\"carne asada\\" steaks, and two sad little lumps of Mexican rice. It was two because I did not want the beans. It was brought out the same time as the appetizer that I ordered, by the way, so I don't know why I bothered ordering an appetizer, that I'm supposed to eat while waiting for the rest of my food. The cheese quesadilla was $8, which was a blend of at least two different kind of cheeses, guessing from the colors. It was made with two pieces of flour tortilla, regular size, with a thin layer of cheese, that normally would cost maybe 2 or 2.50, the most, not 8!\\nAnd now we get to the drink. It's $9. It's prickly pear margarita that they use Cuervo in. To me, Jose Cuervo is a tequila you drink by itself, once any juice or sugar or even water is added, you can not tell the difference anymore. But hey, that's their style and I'm not gonna hate on it too much. To be completely honest, that's about the prices with alcoholic drinks downtown anyway. Did I say downtown? Yes.
