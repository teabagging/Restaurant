We knew how busy the place was so we just didn't make it a big deal. \\n\\nOur second visit, we were given a pager and was told that there's gonna be at least a 30-min wait so we just kept walking around the mall and true enough they paged us on the 30-min mark. This time, I just ordered for saut√©ed chicken angel hair pasta and a cocktail called pimiento pomelo. My chicken was moist and the pasta sauce was decent. Being a huge fan of Italian cuisine, I had better. So, I'd say that this dish was just ok for me. The pimiento pomelo however was good! Our server was friendly and attentive this time. \\n\\nIt was a great dining experience all together!\\n\\n3rd visit, we had the chicken tacos, short rib grilled cheese and the BV burger. I also had the vine street to drink. The chicken tacos were very delicious! I was a bit skeptical trying this dish because I hate cilantro! It was super tasty and the cilantro wasn't even there to taste! The burger was juicy and flavourful and i love how the fries were cut into thinner slices and they weren't oily too! The grilled cheese short rib was just ok for me. I didn't really like the berry jam that was smothered around. It overpowered the cheese itself and just didn't really compliment the sandwich. My cocktail however was the star! My favourite so far! Very mild and refreshing! Our server was very friendly and attentive and food service was fast too!"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Never had authentic Peruvian food.

People were getting up and leaving but since I told my mother that I was taking her out I was determined to get her a decent dinner. I went inside where the hostess was rude when filling out my order as one person in my party had a nut allergy, which apparently was a huge inconvenience. We waited outside for our food to arrive which in total took an hour as one pizza came out at a time (we ordered 5) and my moms pizza was cold by the time that the last pizza came out.we were not given any silverware or napkins and one person in my party was yelled at when we went inside to get silverware.

I have an issue with people thinking that because their business is popular, they can treat you like crap - because hey, even if they lose your service they have a huge line. My sister, who had been looking forward to this for weeks, was so stressed out because the girl ROLLED HER EYES and sighed because my sister didn't know what she wanted the moment she got to the front of the line - even though the line is OUTSIDE so there is no time to really look before you hit the register. It was horrible, she was to scared to ask her if they had bavarian filled donuts after that and so she left without one. I wont be recommending this place.

Not only was the food excellent, but also the pacing of the meal was perfect.  Just enough time between courses to savor the memory of the previous course and be excited about the next.  The chef/owner, Matt Jennings was at the kitchen counter all night and graciously welcomed everyone who sought him out.  We were fans of his at Farmstead in Providence.\\n\\nWe were a party of 6, which was great because it gave us the opportunity to try many of the menu items; all of which were wonderful.  We had everything from the appetizer section of the menu as well as two charcuterie plates: the New England charcuterie and ham.  For each, you choose two of the 6 or so items.  They're served on a beautiful platter with pickled vegetables, deep fried vegetables and honey mustard.  Our server was very informative in helping us choose and we're looking forward to our next visit when we'll try some of the other selections.  All of the appetizers and platters were unequivocally great -- savory, deeply flavored, and appetite whetting!\\n\\nWe had a variety of shared dishes as the main course: tuna crudo, clam crostini, broccoli rabe, mussels, Amish hen, another seafood dish, and the pork item on the menu.  Although we LOVED everything, the standouts were the Amish hen served with chick pea gnocchi & greens and the crostini. The preparations were unique and the food was succulent.\\n\\nI had the baked banana sundae for dessert -- an unusual flavor combination (miso and real, tart cranberries!) made for a real treat.\\n\\nThere was an excellent selection of single malt scotch enjoyed by 3 members of our party and an equally good selection of beer.  My only request of Matt Jennings is that he add some \\"mocktails\\" or interesting juice/selzer combinations to the beverage menu for those of us who are either designated drivers or non-imbibers."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Donuts are imaginatively decorated but don't pass muster on crispiness of doughnut and overall flavor."},{"name":"Radial Cafe - College Park","address":"3725 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Yumbo!!!!

They don't have private rooms, it's just projected on the wall in the dining room, so if you're planning on having a romantic dinner with your beloved then maybe this isn't the best place, BUT if you're planning on bringing a gaggle of friends to get drunk and sing to their hearts content, DO IT.

The building itself is nice, and full of history, but that's about it. You get cornbread with your meal, it was extreme dry. I got a cup of the New England clam chowder which was the best part of the meal. I order the Union Special Lobster which is suppose to have seafood stuffing. The lobster that was presented to me was stuffed with some sort of greasy slug of nothingness. The claw meat from the lobster, that the menu states is served on top of the \\"stuffing\\" had settled down into the grease pit of nothingness and when recovered had so much grease on it, that it was tasteless. I paid $45.00 for the worst stuffed lobster I've ever had. My husband ordered a fried seafood platter. I will say the breading was good however the platter consisted of a huge portion of fries, only 2 shrimp ( one of which he gave to me because I was so disappointed with my meal ) 1 small piece of fried fish and a few fried clams and oysters.

For a place that is lauded as a sports bar, it should be REQUIRED that management and staff are at least somewhat in tune with the sports scene. I had the same experience during college football when i was driving around listening to a Top 10 matchup that was going into overtime. I pulled over and stopped in to catch it and it wasn't even on. The place was dead. I don't expect em to know a Mariners or Seahawks game, but the sweet 16? Really?\\n\\nThat by itself is simply poor management.

The gnocchi dumplings themselves were pretty terrible - gnocchi are supposed to be light and puffy little pillows, and the ones served here are dense chunks of potatoes. What's worse is that on the night we went the \\"seasonal summer vegetables\\" in the gnocchi were mostly bell peppers whose strong flavor overpowered everything else and ruined the dish. We also had the \\"confused mussels\\" which were described as classic buttery garlic mussels infused with basil, mint, and lemongrass. The mussels were unfortunately bland and lacked the garlic-ness that usually makes mussels taste so good. The broth/sauce on the noodles had so much basil in it that it tasted like I was eating a thistle - I couldn't taste any of the other herbs because the basil was far too strong.

IT'S A TOURIST TRAP.  \\n\\nMy friend and I were subjected to the worst customer service we have ever experienced.  When the waitress seated us at the bar area, she informed us that there was a $24 minimum.  She never mentioned, unfortunately, that this fee was per person.  My friend and I ordered 2 drinks and a dessert, then promptly asked for the check.  The waiter told us that we did not reach our monetary minimum.  Obviously we were very confused by this since we were under the impression that we only needed to pay a minimum of $24. \\n\\nWe asked to speak with the manager.  The manager \\"Ricardo\\" approached the table and said \\"What's your problem\\".  We explained what happened and he called us \\"liars\\", that he's the one who trains his staff so he knows what they tell customers when seating them.  He refused to believe that we were in fact telling the truth about not knowing, then threatened to call security if we didn't pay because it was \\"non-negotiable\\".  At no point was he apologetic or sympathetic regarding this issue. \\n\\nOur bill came out to be about $30, however we were forced to pay a total over $50 because of the added fee.  I cannot believe that this sort of blatantly false advertising (failing to disclose the charge) can be legal (we didn't see the $$ minimum posted anywhere in the establishment) My friend has left several messages with the owner, Rafael Oliver, none of which have yet been returned. \\n\\nI would also like to mention that we ran into the manager \\"Ricardo\\" in the elevator we took to leave the restaurant that night.  We asked for his last name so we could file a complaint, which he refused to give us - then he demanded to see our IDs, which he has no legal authority to do.  Obviously we refused and were very upset with his irrational behavior.  We again asked him again to tell us his name, he refused  and said \\"what are you going to do about it\\" while literally getting in my friend's face.  It was the most absurd scene I have ever witnessed.  I personally work in the customer service field, and I am absolutely appalled by the behavior of this manager \\"Ricardo (Soto?)\\".  We can only guess the last name, since the hostess and 2 waiters that night could not tell us for sure if that was his name.

We were using GPS and it took us to an art store where there were several parked cars in a small parking lot. Not sure what to make of it, we parked and another car parked behind us as well. We were skeptical that this was the right place, so before we got out of the car, we saw another car passing by heading towards the back, so we decided to follow it as did the car that parked behind us. Our fears were not subdued as we pulled into what can only be described as an abandoned parking lot behind an abandoned warehouse. Finally we got in a line of cars pulling into a loading dock typically used for large trucks. Not the easiest place to find. There was complementary valet.\\n\\nOnce inside, there is live music playing very loudly. The lighting is dark and the waiting area can get a little crowded. The food itself was delicious. We got mussels for appetizers and the fried green tomatoes was spectacular. I don't typically order that dish, but my friend did and when I tried it, I knew that for the rest of my life any fried green tomatoes I ate would be compared with the one I had here, it was that good! Thank you for ordering it! No need to go into details about the entrees. They were very good, made on an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.

It was crowded, but not uncomfortable. We sat inside, however the deck looks worth visiting another time. \\n\\nWe started with the deviled eggs and chicken liver pate, both were great. My gf had the ratatouille, mom had the rabbit, and I had the lamb on our server's recommendation. All of them were outstanding. Obviously, given the restaurant's theme, the menu is pretty heavily skewed towards meats, but my taste of the ratatouille was awesome and a worthwhile non-meat option. The lamb was incredibly tender and flavorful, and I would definitely order it again. I will point out, as one other reviewer did, that ordering it medium rare resulted in a more rare chop - which I enjoy, but some may want to order medium to be safe.  The rabbit is prepared 4 ways - it provides a lot of variety and is also very good - especially the rabbit loin and the sausage.  \\n\\nFor a side we got the artichokes, which were delicious but we over-ordered and could not finish them. Desert we had the recommended toffee cake (or pudding), which is very good but also rich and heavy after all the other courses. Our server nicely brought us lemon cake to try (her favorite), which I preferred as well given my previous courses of lamb and pate. You can't go wrong either way, however. \\n\\nThe service was quite good, although I could tell our server was overburdened a little. She was quite knowledgeable and it is apparent the restaurant is doing its part to make sure everyone is well versed in their offerings.  Because it was busy, we were there for 2.5hrs, which is a little long for a Thursday, but I'm sure once they bring a few more people on things will run smoothly. Not enough to lower my rating, in any case.

First of all, the place was almost completely empty yet the host sat us in the bar section where the bartender was our waitress and she could not properly attend to us because she was stuck behind the bar almost the entire time. My drink went empty for a while and then was only refilled one time. It took them about 20 minutes to bring the spinach dip appetizer that we ordered. The salads that we had ordered with our steaks ended up coming before the spinach dip. My friend and I each took two bites of the spinach dip,  pushed it to the side, and didn't eat any more of it. The chips were WAY too salty and the spinach dip was watery and tasteless. I told our waitress that we didn't like it and she could see that we had hardly touched it, yet it was still on our bill at the end of the meal. I had to ask the manager to take it off, which he did. The \\"loaded\\" baked potatoes were TINY and hardly had anything on them! What a JOKE! I ordered a 6oz filet medium-well, and what I got was BARELY MEDIUM... Pink and red all the way through. I had them take it back so they could cook it a little more but when I got back it was BURNED... WAY PAST WELL DONE. I wish I had taken a photo of it because it didn't even look like a fillet. My friend ordered a sirloin and they looked exactly the same. A filet is supposed to be a ROUND cut of meat about 2 inches thick... This thing was just a regular flat steak. It tasted Ok, but it was not AT ALL what I was expecting a filet to look like. And the waitress was really rude and condescending when I told her that I didn't think it was a filet and that they had made a mistake. The only reason that I came here was because I had a $50 gift card that someone gave me for Christmas, so the meal was actually free to me. Good thing it was because I would have been pretty pissed if I had actually spent any of my OWN money at this AWFUL PLACE!!!

Every bite was great, and the sandwich was really enough in terms of a meal.  I'd highly recommend.\\n\\nThe small French press, as described, is the small version.  There is a larger one, but this press can fill two cups with coffee, as we both shared this press.  I liked the coffee, and for the price of it, it almost beats a drip coffee, which is about 1 dollar cheaper.  If anything, it's nice to look at and to operate the press (yep they bring it out to your table)\\n\\nFinally, the chocolate macaroon cake was out of this world.  In general, you start to lose the consistency of macaroons when you upsize to cakes, but the actual layers of Amelie's cake were just as crispy, just as airy, and the filling was just as rich.  This three layer piece of work almost cannot be eaten by one person, and in fact, two of us couldn't finish it, but we tried!  So large is this thing that they garnish the top with a small (normal) sized macaroon on top, which was also delicious! Highly recommend!\\n\\nThe interior of Amelie's is spacious, with several small tables.  There is a front entrance, but you're very likely to use the rear entrance since ample parking can be found there.  Getting into or out of this lot isn't bad, but it is shared with other businesses.\\n\\nOn Friday's there's weekly Open mic nights ($5 cover) too, if you're feeling poetic, or if you're simply looking to listen to others who are inspired to get in front of an audience.\\n\\nAmelie's is a great find, open but cozy, lots of variety, excellent food/flavors and even entertainment on Friday nights.  Come here for breakfast, for sweets, for whatever suits you.....just come!"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Just had another fantastic dining experience at Andina.

The food was pretty tasty, in fact my daughter said the kids french toast was the best she'd had, but unfortunately the service wasn't good at all.  We waited unacknowledged at the hostess stand while the employee typed on the PC like an airline reservationist, another employee approached the stand, but instead of acknowledging us, proceeded to text.    Things went down from there.  \\n\\nAs you know, if you have children, they don't necessarily remember the service, just the food.  As a result, at their request,  we went back again a few weeks later to give it another try.  Again, the service was lacking.  Same situation at the hostess stand.   Once seated, waited 15 minutes for a server to arrive.  Food took forever, order incorrect, drinks actually arrived after the food.  Server never returned to refill drinks.  Waited and waited to get servers attention to ask for coffee creamer, salt/pepper, ketchup, etc. but since he was AWOL, we just consumed everything as it was.  This time, however, the food wasn't good.   Most of us had the standard 2 egg breakfast (eggs, potatoes, bacon),  The eggs were pretty good all around, however, the potatoes, which might not have been from the day before (possible though) were horrible.  Most were so dry they had cracked apart.  The bacon was definitely not made to order and was inedible.    \\n\\nIt's really a shame, because they have a great space.  It appears though that they no longer try like they did previously, and are hoping to capitalize on the overflow from the newer restaurants in the area.    As i read some of the other reviews, i realize that a common theme is the lack of management oversight.  Food leaving the kitchen that shouldn't, little to no training of the staff, and absolutely no oversight in the dining room.  the employees seem to know this and do things however they want.

Fourteen.  Interestingly enough, we did not balloon up to twice our size, break out in hives, or do irreparable damage to our health ('Course, i haven't watched that movie, since i don't want to ruin it for myself).  Indeed, the only time we felt ill health was a bad decision to switch to Burger King for lunch in Las Vegas.  We switched right back and felt much better.  \\n\\nWhat you learn from it, though, is that some McDonaldses are more worthy than others.  It doesn't matter if it's considered by most to be a low-end job, it's still plain as day when you see people do it well, and even with this most institutionalized of food, giving a damn shows.  \\n\\nSo it's with this in mind that i salute the McDonald's on Route 9 in Natick.  This is consistently the best in the Boston area that i know of.  Fresh, crisp fries with the proper amount of salt, well-constructed sandwiches big and small, a flawlessly mixed cup of Coke.  Fast, perfect, and cheerful (the drive-thru girl took a picture of my smart car today, so amused was she).  \\n\\nSometimes i adjust my route home from work to hit this one, as it is simply that much better than the ones on Needham St. in Newton (you'll never get a good drink), and on 128 (screws you on the fries and chicken mcnuggets, every time).\\n\\nThis is serious business people.  \\n\\nStop laughing!"},{"name":"R Rice","address":"6115 Peachtree Dunwoody Rd, Ste 120","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been a customer of R.

It is a tourist trap! And I fell for it. I have seen Voodoo Doughnuts everywhere, from the food network and the travel channel and food blogs. I have always wanted to visit and try their donuts for as long as I can remember. The premise and unique donuts were just enticing. I was excited and hyped to finally try it after years and years of seeing it. However, it is just the biggest disappointment ever. \\n\\nWe went on a Friday afternoon and the line was just inside. Thank goodness there was not a long line because I would have been even more upset for standing in line for this. It is cash only and there's an ATM before reaching the counter to select your donuts. The menu was tough to read and I had no idea what was going on. It was not cohesive at all and too much going on. So I had to rely on the spinning case of donuts to see which one we would get. Once we got to the counter, the employees were rushing us to select donuts. I get that they're trying to get the line moving, but a) there wasn't even a line and b) we have no idea what to get because of the hot mess of a store it is. We eventually got the fruit loops donut and the coconut with guava filling. \\n\\nThe donuts are not good at all. At all. The fruit loop donuts was unnecessarily massive. The donut itself was alright. The frosting was disgusting and too sweet. Frosting should not be put on donuts. It wasn't even good quality frosting. It was a bit runny and too thin. The fruit loops were stale and hard and didn't even taste like fruit loops. We only ate like 25% of it. The coconut guava was not as bad, but still not good. Again, frosting should not be put on donuts. There was way too much frosting on this one and had to scrape it off. The guava filling was good, but it tasted artificial. \\n\\nI understand that this is a novelty item and a touristy thing. But it was just awful and disgusting.

I think probably a 4.5 if I could.  The issue I had with this restaurant was that it took an eternity for the waiter to take our order.  AND, you don't get any delicious bread with amazing interesting salsas until you order (or so it was with us anyway).  My friend ordered the green salad with cotija cheese, pumpkin seeds? and seasonal veggies (I saw asparagus).  She loved her salad.\\n\\nMy other friend had the seafood paella and she ate every last bite. There seemed to be a nice variety of textures there, including a fried piece of fish on top.  I thought that seemed like a very good idea.\\nI had a really really difficult time deciding what to order.  I went with the marinated chicken with a red salsa, it came with a fried piece of yucca, which was really good.  Actually, the best yucca I've ever had and I've been forced to eat a lot.\\n\\nI also ordered the Causa morada (sp?).  It was a (boiled?) purple potato mashed with lime and stuffed with chicken and a yellow pepper sauce, served with avocado on the side, in the shape of a hockey puck.  This was super interesting.  It ended up tasting like a special potato salad.  For me, it was a little bit too much creamy stuff and was missing something fresh or crunchy tasting.  \\n\\nFor dessert my friend had the mousse, which was good (but if I'm going to have mousse, I need it to just be chocolate, I don't need other flavors, other than a dollop of whipped cream).  She raved about it, though.  My other friend and I had the flan de queso de cabra (sp? I am an A-hole with a Cuban husband who is butchering all the spanish names, or not remembering them at all!).  So this was a goat milk cheese cake with lemon, strawberries cut up on the side, and a delicious strawberry habanero sauce.  The sauce made it perfection.  It was awesome.  We also ordered a pot of coffee, which was very very very good somehow.  I don't know what made it so special, but this morning I was staring rudely at my coffee maker, wishing it could live up to the coffee at Andina.\\n\\nI WILL be back.

Since Jeremy had never been to our nation's oldest restaurant, it seemed necessary to hit up the UOH. We got drinks and oysters, but the oysters were awful. They were a) not shucked, b) not on ice, c) accompanied by condiments served in plastic take-out containers, and d) unaccompanied by the proper utensils. \\n\\nNow, I know that the UOH has a captive audience with all the out-of-towners that must flood the place all summer. Surely this must give a restaurant bad habits. But as a resident of the culinary wonderland that is Boston, I'm disappointed that so many that will visit the city will get such poor service. \\n\\nWe paid ~$60 for three drinks and a dozen oysters. That's more than enough to get oysters on fucking ice. Why no ice? You are giving me raw seafood. Put that shit on ice. And why are the cocktail sauce and horseradish in to-go containers?

Usually  piled on pizzas are also the 'grease rolling down your sleeves' kind of feast. Not that I don't like that but now days my mind can picture what all that grease is doing to my arteries. I suspect that Juliano's cook their toppings separately and add them later on in the processi. Whatever the case is, they end up with pizza's that thick with toppings a-plenty and yet are amazingly not that greasy. The net effect is that one can actually taste the separate ingredients  instead of a mish mash of greasy unidentifiable toppings. That also makes the last bite almost a good as the first bite.

This place looks like a Yelp favorite, but it let hubs and me down.\\n\\n -We were in and out in 40 minutes. That includes ordering time, food waiting time, eating time, and doggy-bag time. This can be perceived as good or bad. I felt a bit rushed, and this was our date night, so this borderlines on bad for me.\\n\\n- The bread basket is the absolute highlight of this meal. Holy moly...absolutely amazing. \\n- I like Popeyes fried chicken better. OMG blasphemy, I know but this chicken lacked taste. We each went with the 3 piece leg fried chicken meal with two sides. My choices were the mac 'n cheese and tomato pie. Hubs ordered the creamed corn and sweet potato souffle.\\n- Tomato pie: pretty decent! Except for the large chunks of clearly canned tomatoes. \\n- Mac 'n cheese: Eh. I expect more from a fancy southern place. Lots of cheese, lacked flavor.\\n- Creamed corn: Good. Probably frozen.\\n- Sweet potato souffle: Too much cinnamon. Hubs didn't want to finish it, so I was forced to eat it (immigrant mentality: no plate left filled).\\n\\nBONUS: We each received an extra piece of chicken! Yay! And service was top notch. The ordering thing with the paper and the pencil seems a bit wasteful to me. We filled in our dessert on one, but the server asked us again if we wanted dessert...which means maybe they don't read the papers fully? We said no as we were a bit disappointed with our meals. \\n\\nWe passed by Church's Chicken and Popeyes on the way home and were sad."},{"name":"Red Pagoda","address":"1408 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I was starving and craving pho and wanted somewhere close to my house for a quick bite, so although I remembered seeing a lot of bad reviews for this place in the past, they now had enough positive feedback for me to give it a shot.\\n\\nMe and my boyfriend went for a late lunch, and there was one other person eating when we arrived, and 3 other tables came in over the course of our meal. We were greeted promptly, if not enthusiastically (at all...) and sat down. The decor is ok, if a bit dingy - but that's kind of what I expect at a good pho place. \\n\\nMy first gripe is that they don't have a choice of size for their pho, leaving me to assume the size would be medium. It's not. I ordered their peanut chicken soup, which sounded super delicious, in theory. The boyfriend ordered regular pho with beef, and we got spring rolls to share. \\n\\nThe spring rolls were ok, really nothing to write home about, they had a bit of an odd texture, and were a little bland (when something requires a crap ton of sriracha to make it enjoyable, it's not great). \\n\\nI might have been ravenously hungry, but even I recognised that the bath-sized bowl of soup in front of me was unfinishable. The peanutty soup in my trough was pretty good, but the chicken was abysmal - it was chewy, horrifyingly fatty (and the fat was a very strange colour), and highly unpleasant.  I picked at it, and eventually just ate some noodles and soup, which were passable. When I was too full to eat any more I had skimmed maybe 2 inches and it looked barely touched. \\n\\nI tried my boyfriend's pho, and the broth was ok, but didn't make me go back for a second spoonful by any means. Boyfriend is the kind of guy who always sees the best in things, and is the most positive person I know - with that in mind, when I asked how his pho was, his response was \\"...it's ok,\\" which is pretty much the most damning thing he could have said. \\n\\nWhen we were done I just wanted to leave, but it took probably 10 minutes to get the server's attention. She walked by 3 times, and we heard her chatting with the others in the kitchen, but steadfastly ignored us. When I finally did get her attention she seemed super put out and put upon.

All in all, it was OK, nothing to \\"wow\\" us though. We started with mussels as an app. Mediocre at best, I've had much better. Seemed a bit bland and not very high-quality. My friends had salmon and bass. They enjoyed their meals, however, the dishes seemed overpriced. I was brave and ordered the Element burger, which is a blend of about four different wild game meats.The meat was tasty and well-prepared, however, mushroom garnish was tasteless and the shoestring fries looked and tasted like they came from a frozen bag purchased at the supermarket. They were cold and did not have any color or crispness. The truffle butter was interesting, however, I'm so glad I asked for it on the side as it was incredibly rich and would have overpowered the burger completely.\\n\\nMy friends ordered hot tea and were shocked to find out that only ONE option was available, a generic black tea. They ended up drinking hot water, sadly, since they were chilled from the rain. Lemon was not offered till much, much later. It's the little things that count , you know! \\n\\nMy main comment is that it seems this restaurant has an \\"identity crisis.\\" Do they wish to be fine dining, with high-end seafood dishes and gourmet burgers? Or do they wish to be a sports bar with wings and big screen TVs? The bar seems to be ready for a football game and rowdy customers, however, the dining room is trying for something more upper class.  \\n\\nThe lighting is terrible in the dining room; way too bright! We sat at a booth but I noticed that the chairs were all made of metal with wooden seats so seems they don't want their diners to stay for very long! Very rigid and hard furniture combined with concrete floors, I started to wonder if we were in a country and western bar and soon would hear \\"Give me your heart, your achy-breaky heart.\\" blast through the speakers!\\n\\nUltimately, the Element Bistro has lots of potential, however, management needs to decide how they wish to structure their menu and environment in order to suit a particular clientele. Right now feels like they are trying too hard to please everyone. I think anything called a \\"bistro\\" should be more family and neighborhood oriented, a place where people can meet after work or meet for a quick and affordable lunch. The fine dining energy doesn't seem to fit this locale. I suggest the owners visit 95A Bistro and Sushi in Lafayette.

It had a really good spice and the fruit salsa that it was served with contrasted well with the spiciness.  \\nI enjoyed the pumpkin curry, all of the root vegetables it was served with were delicious.  The fig chutney provided a nice sweetness.  However, it was too much served with rice AND naan, the veggies were really enough on their own.

Once at the cash register, we ordered a box of doughnuts. I kept my eyes on the blueberry cake doughnut (although  I should have just went with the old fashioned cake doughnut now that I think about it). I like blueberries though and I've had blueberry doughnuts so I thought this would be good too. The doughnuts were cheap. Good prices. Service was okay. The donut shop is quite eclectic in decor and \\"in-your-face\\" with doughnuts. Some were decorated with cereal (I don't care for) and others were plain like chocolate frosting or sprinkles. There was a really large doughnut too. I didn't get to eat my doughnut until the morning because we were just all too tired once we got to the place we were staying.\\n\\nThen next day, I tried my doughnut. It was alright. The other blueberry doughnut I've had at another place did it better in terms of flavor. I mean keeping it in it's box couldn't have changed the flavor much, right? It was cake-y, soft in the middle and had a blueberry flavor. Tasted really artificial though. Unfortunately it was the only doughnut I tried from Voodoo but at the point I wasn't really craving doughnuts or really sweet things anymore. \\n\\nCon: CASH ONLY.

(Note: If Via 313 is open when you're reading this, stop reading this review and just go there!)\\n\\nAll the tables were full, so we sat at the bar. We ordered some appetizers. Plenty of vegetarian-friendly stuff here--my fiance was pleased. The beet salad was excellent; the carrots were a total miss (but when they found out we didn't like them, they removed them from our bill.)\\n\\nThe real issue is that the place just can't get food out quickly enough. We waited...and waited...and waited...and WAITED! for our pizza. It got to the point where I was super grumpy due to low blood sugar. I watched them make pizza after pizza from our vantage point at the bar; they only take about 5 minutes to cook. But we were there nearly an hour before we were served. It's way too long.\\n\\nFinally, I could see there were only two tickets left. Time for pizza? In another 15 minutes, yeah, our pizza finally came out. We got the fennel sausage with an egg on top.\\n\\nThe pizza was good. I'll give them that. But not *great*. It was soggy in the middle (fiance blames the egg, which thankfully is optional.) The edges were good, and the ingredients were clearly fresh. But nothing we couldn't have gotten in less than 20 minutes at Southside Flying Pizza or Via 313.\\n\\nThe best thing? The pesto sauce, which we had to ask for (twice). We dipped the pizza crusts in it. Some of the best pesto I've ever had. Delicious.

On my one and only visit, I ordered the cheese tray for an appetizer and the barbeque chicken with mac n' cheese for an entree. The cheese tray included a nice selection of highly flavorful, diverse cheeses, but the entree was just OK. I didn't taste any uniqueness in the BBQ sauce and the mac n' cheese was by no means extraordinary. For dessert, we opted for the carrot cake, which was just plain bland. Moreover, the cake was accompanied by a pile of shredded ground chocolate cookie, which provided no compliment to the flavor or presentation of the dish. The one novel aspect of the menu is the wine list, which allows you to purchase volumes of wine between a glass and a bottle (e.g. 1.5 glass or 3 glass carafe).\\n\\nService: The server was friendly, efficient, and eager to answer any questions. However, we did dine during the first seating, so I imagine the situation likely would have been different had we come later in the evening.\\n\\nAtmosphere: This place has more tease than Molly Ringwald's hair in Sixteen Candles.

After about 50 minutes in the cold, we were told we could wait inside. We spent the next 15 - 20 minutes standing next to an empty table which would have served our group (four adults and one four-year old) because the staff was waiting for the two-seater next to that table to open in order to jam in a group of seven. (We know that was the reason because we asked if we could have the table.) Ultimately, the seven were seated elsewhere and we were told we could have the table next to us.\\n\\nThe Service - The waitress never refreshed our waters or coffees, much less show real interest in how we were doing. When I asked for a particular beer, she said they were out, but she would check to see what else they had. Ten minutes later, our eyes met and you could see the \\"oh, I forgot!\\" spark of recognition. Shortly thereafter she came to the table to offer a comparable beer. The beer arrived with a glass that obviously just came out of the dishwasher-- not exactly the yin to the yang of an ice cold beer. After no luck getting the waitress's attention to get a cooler glass, I got resourceful and poured ice water into the glass to cool it off.\\n\\nThe Food - My wife loved her meal (Huevos Rancheros). Likewise, she raved about the beignet. I ordered the \\"Bad to the Bone\\" sandwich. Have to say, the description was better than the execution. It was ok, but was just sort of a mash-up of ingredients. No seasoning or balancing of flavors to match what the menu promised. (My wife took a bite and wasn't impressed either.)\\n\\nThe Bill - I overheard the waitress ask the table of two next to us if they wanted to split the bill or if it was together. Good approach. She then came to our table and just put the one bill down with a big \\"thank you\\" even though it was pretty obvious there were at least two groups at our table. However, that slight was quickly forgotten when we saw that a 20% gratuity had already been added to the bill. Really? For a group of four? (Ok, five if you count my daughter.) I understand a mandatory tip for a group of six or eight which requires a lot of attention, but to add 20% for a group of four that didn't get any attention-- especially without it being explicitly stated on the menu?

Somehow they get the proportions of B to L to T to Mayo to Bread just right. Even though it seems that there is little BLT when compared to the fries, believe me, there is enough. And it will leave you wanting more, only next time.\\n\\nThe fries are steak fries. They are unseasoned, but there is salt,pepper, and ketchup at every table. They are fried in extremely small batches, and I have yet to see them sitting under a lamp. (don't let the check ins fool you, I have been to this place at least 10 times) I think they make them special for you.\\n\\nTheir Gyro sandwich is very good as well, the ingredients come together nicely, and the port inside it is cooked perfectly. One time though they put a little too much sauce (not sure how to spell it) and feta into it. This knocked off proportions, and caused the whole thing to fall apart. Ahh well, no one bats a hundred.\\n\\nP.S. The pickles here are stupendous. Don't be surprised when if you ask for extra they charge you. I'm told people come in and get only pickles. Seriously, their that good. Cole Slaw is pretty good too.\\n\\nFrench toast (and bacon) leaves a little to be desired.

Staff directed us through the dining room to the back of house host/bar area. Our reservation was confirmed and we were taken to a small table.\\n\\nThe ambiance is cozy and lived-in, yet upscale. Textures and colors abound from the walls themselves as well as from the many pieces of art hanging throughout the dining room. Our table looked into the bar through a paned window, which added depth and light to a dark space. Although we had two people looking after us, we never felt imposed upon or rushed.

Beer and hand-crafted cocktails are also on offer; my pomegranate cosmopolitan packed a punch. Their per-glass wines are reasonably priced, if you're not looking to drop $60-$75+ on a bottle.\\n\\nThe daily menu features several choices of appetizers and entrees, including items listed as \\"A Surprise.\\" Bread service is a la carte - definitely get some bread, just in case you end up with a surprise appetizer of steamed clams and need something to soak up the delicious broth. We also ordered a green salad with a zippy sherry vinaigrette to round out our appetizers.\\n\\nTrue to form, Alana came around with a smoked trout crostini amuse bouche, a little pop of flavor with fresh chives.\\n\\nThe spouse ordered the entr√©e surprise, which turned out to be a Chicken a la King pasta dish (\\"Oh, yay!\\" he said).

Before we even were able to serve the cake (oh yes, we did that ourselves) she was bringing the checks to the table. We weren't finished!

(If the line is out the door, you're probably looking at an hour).  You won't get the restaurant experience of sitting down, having your order taken etc etc.  You order your food, watch it being cooked in front of you, and then sit down at one of the atbles that is (hopefully available) before you scarf down your food quickly and leave so as to avoid being subject to glares by diners still waiting for seats....  Finally- and mentally prepare for this one - no brunch Mimosas... It doesn't serve alcohol.\\n\\nSo now, the positivces - and they do out-weigh the negatives.  Firstly, if you go before 11am or after 1:30pm you can, if not avoid the queue, at least reduce the time you spend in it.  Plus, the time you spend waiting in line allows you to check out what everyone else is ordering - and avoid the food envy I usually get when everyone at my table gets their orders and someone else's looks significantly more delicious than mine...  Secondly, it's kind of cool to see your food being cooked - at least you know they're doing it right.  And thridly, I am yet to get my order and not find a place to sit.

Hmmmm. $1.00 for chips and salsa. \\n\\nSo for a small salad and 3 small mixed tacos, no drinks is $30.00.  Probably will not go back.

I agree the prices are great but I have to say you get what you pay for. The restaurant is pretty clean and the service was fine. I should also mention that my parents are from Calcutta so I grew up on Bengali food and while the food here may be authentic; I found it to be very oily. We ordered the following items:\\n\\nChotpoti - A traditional Bengali snack food with a mixture of potatoes and chickpeas that should be spicy and sour and I didn't find theirs to be either. \\n\\nVegetable Samosa - They were pretty good but a little on the greasy side. \\n\\nTandoori Chicken - I thought this was the best thing we ordered. Pretty flavorful  and the chicken was cooked well, it was just greasy. \\n\\nGoat Curry - This is probably my favorite Bengali dish and I was highly disappointed in it. The curry was spicy and there was a decent amount of meat, but it was super oily (I could see a layer of oil on top of the curry that was a cm thick). I took a few bites of it before I decided I did not want anymore. \\n\\nNaan - Pretty good naan here. No complaints. \\n\\nI was not impressed with Al -Amin and not sure if I will be returning.

The rest was quite lacking for an upscale establishment they pretend to be. The food is good, not amazing as the price tag would suggest, but solidly good. They have a good wine selection, as long as you are in the $60+ per bottle range, which is OK for this type of place. The service is an elaborately staged upscale show, with lots of busy looking workers all over the place. However, they forget the most important thing, the customer. Speed and timeliness are also not relevant in the world of Top of the Hub. Obviously we are all there just to gawk at the view, not actually, you know, eat. Or drink really. \\n\\nMy previous experiences of this place have always left me with a lukewarm feeling. I accept it as an obligatory cocktail to which I must always bring my out of town friends. \\n\\nBut tonight really lowers that lukewarm feeling to quite chilly. Had a dinner reservation for five people, celebrating a birthday. Got a good table, not next to the window, but close enough. The server, and his trainee right behind him, came over quickly. Good start. Got us water, but no bread. We were still deciding on drinks, so he said he would return shortly to take our drink order. And then he disappeared for 10 minutes.. So we waited. He returned, chatted us up about the various wine choices, took the wine order and left. Then he once again disappeared for over 5 minutes, before returning to take our dinner order. After our food was brought by someone else, he materialized to check on us a few minutes later. And to give one of us a missing fork. But at this point we are eating, drinking wine, and generally happy and willing to overlook the previous disappearances as a fluke. \\n\\nIt wasn't a fluke. All 5 of us finished our meals and then just sat there twiddling our thumbs for quite some time before anyone came to check on us. The server finally came to clear the plates and ask us about desert. Brought us a few desert menus and then ran away again. As we sat there, the night falling outside, patiently waiting for the server to return to take our order. He finally did. After quickly eating the creme brule, we were ready to leave. But hotel Top of the Hub is not the kind of place you just leave. The server was busy helping the table next to us take pictures, and then the table on the other side of us decide on a drink. When he quickly walked by us, he completely ignored me trying to get his attention to get the check. The check eventually came, and he eventually cashed us out. In the end the meal took three hours, while we were looking to leave in two, the extra hour went to waiting for Godot. We left feeling agitated at being hostage by slow service. \\n\\nTLTR: Definitely get a drink there, check out the awesome views of the city. Make sure you go on a clear day, because the clouds can really ruin the view, seeing as you are above them sometimes. Don't eat there.

Bigger carrots would be pretty good too.  Still....I probably ate more than I should have because it was just too good to put down.

I guess I should have known better than to order fish when everyone else at the table opted for the hamburger. It's not a good sign when the most popular item on the menu of a restaurant that requires a reservation is a hamburger. Both times I've been, the food has been overcooked and over-seasoned. I've tried meats and I've tried seafood and was disappointed with both. The best item on the menu is the mac and cheese which comes bubbling hot in a mini deep dish skillet.\\n\\nIn the end, I get the impression that lots of people overrate the quality of the food because they're so impressed with the ambiance of the restaurant itself. I've been to a lot of restaurants in Atlanta, and Two Urban Licks is one of the coolest looking and feeling out there.

I have been to almost every McMenamins out there, except their new hotel in Washington, and Kennedy School is my favorite. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nThe ambiance is incredible. I don't find it as creepy as other reviewers (except on Halloween. You have to experience the costumes there on Halloween.  Just grab a bench, a bottle of wine, and people watch)  I think it is very intimate and funky. Weird combo but they pull it off at all of their hotels. My only frustration, but it adds to the experience, it how short the bathroom stalls are. I am 5'9\\" and can see over the top of the stall. Solution: go have more beers and you won't care.  My husband and I feel Kennedy School is our favorite date night destinations.\\n\\nPassport\\nYou have to do their passport!!! I swear if you hit just a few of their places it pays for itself.  At Kennedy School you get a clue and have to hunt down the picture that fits the description. We gave my nephew the clue and let him hunt down the answer while we grabbed some drinks in the Honors Bar. I now have McMenamins schwag galore from just visiting their multiple locations.\\n\\nDrinks\\nTheir beer is consistent and they only have a few seasonal additions but oh well since their regular beer is good. Yes it's not fantastic but the Terminator and Ruby are quite good. I like their wine. The Black Rabbit red is a solid pinot. I took a bottle back to family in Arizona and they enjoyed it. My favorite wine is their Fireside port style wine. I typically buy a bottle  and drink on it all night. It is rich and not overly sweet for a port. I have not tried their white wine but I took my German relatives here and they thought it was solid. \\n\\nFood\\nLike their drinks it is not Portland standards of outstanding but for visitors not accustomed to Portland's amazing food scene, their food is good. I crave their Cajun tots and I like their steak sandwiches. I have never had a bad meal here but honestly I don't go for the food. \\n\\nRooms\\nDetention is way to smoky for me and I don't like cigars. I prefer the Cypress room for their reggae music and the Boiler room to play some pool. It is fun grabbing a beer at one place and then just wandering around. Courtyard is good for groups since it can accommodate a lot of people and the fire outside is nice and cozy. I would love to see more barrooms added on.\\n\\nOverall, we love supporting McMenamins and out of all of the McMenamins options, Kennedy School is our favorite.

I was so disappointed!  Since they sold pizza by the slice, I asked if they carried pepperoni.  I was told yes (with an attitude, as if I were stupid).  Anyhow, I placed my order and they took a piece of cold cheese pizza (you could tell that the cheese had started to congeal) and slapped a few pepperoni on top and threw it in the oven to reheat.  First, I was concerned about food safety - Serve Safe typically recommends maintaining foods at 140 to prevent food-born illness.  There is no way that cheese pizza was at 140 before being put into the oven.  IDK, maybe there is an exception for pizza based on its ingredients being more shelf stable or something.  \\n\\nBack to the issue at hand, the pizza was horrid.  Terrible flavor.  Burnt crust - not just that wonderful stone baked, kind of charred flavor, but more like carbon & dirt.  Yuck.  The pepperoni were greasy and not cooked - I could have taken some pepperoni from a package at the grocery and microwaved them for 10 seconds to get the same effect.  Hardly any cheese.  The pizza was not docked well - air bubbles everywhere and hardly any toppings. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, most of the tables in the small dining area were dirty and the staff was rude.  When you first walk in you get this visual of a great little mom & pop pizza joint with old-time diner booths - full of community with pics, awards, and Little League stuff on the walls.  However, the service was totally lacking the hospitality that the visual conveyed.  Too bad - lot's of potential.  \\n\\nOn a positive note, I loved seeing Armando's support of Little League.  Thumbs up for caring about kids!  They also had a place to recycle your bottles and cans from their drinks rather than just toss them in the trash.

Pepperonis were small but crispy, and the sauce was plentiful (I love buckets of sauce on mine personally). \\n\\nIn conclusion - I think it's worth the wait, especially if you're hungry.

Let me just say that the Cabbage Rolls were just as good as ever!!!

I was like,  \\" your going to service it all at once?\\"  One of the servers was like, \\" Well do you want me to bring your entree's out later?\\"  No, of course I don't want our entrees sitting under a heat lamp while we have our salads and soup.  So the table was crowed with all the apps. and entree plates.   One of our party asked for a 2nd glass of wine 3 times.  The 3rd time the original server was like \\" haven't they brought you that wine yet\\"  Ahhh, no, why don't you go get it yourself.  I don't recall her asking anyone else if they want more drinks and I know she never came back to see how the meal was and do we want desert and coffee ( Big$ mistake). Oh and that glass of wine? It was a no show as well  I want to think, well there are a few other big parties in this section.  But #1:  This is what they do, they always have big parties on a Saturday night and #2  I saw our original server standing around so it's not like she was busy.

The past two times have been terrible and we will not be back.\\n\\nI was looking for a good burger place to take my brother and our girlfriends for dinner before jurassic world, and bar 145 and bareburger were our options. We decided on bar 145, and had absurd wait times to be greeted, to get water, to put in our orders, to get our appetizers, to get our food, and to get our checks. Our waitress didn't seem to have a grip on what she was doing, which is fine if she's new, but don't schedule her on a Saturday night. The place used to be packed on the weekends, but the last two times, it's been pretty empty, so there's no excuse that she was stretched too thin. Our appetizers came and she didn't come to check on us in a reasonable amount of time, so one of us had to go and ask for plates. Again, it took too long to get our main courses. They brought out my brother and his girlfriend's food, one of which was undercooked, and said nothing about mine and my girlfriend's. We flagged down our waitress and she was flustered trying to figure out what happened. I watched her go back and put our orders in the computer and walk around a bit, before coming back and telling us that there was a kitchen error. I asked to talk to the manager, but she took about 7 minutes before even telling him. He then waited until our food came out before coming over to us. I explained to him that our service was unacceptable. He said that he couldn't comp an entire table and that this is the fourth or fifth table he's had to come over to tonight, that he's been the manager for two months and hired 9 people and was trying to change things, and so on. He said that he would make sure the check was fair because we he wanted us to leave happy. We then waited another twenty five minutes before our waitress came back with five checks. One for each of us and then one catch all for appetizers and anything else. We explained that she should just split everything in half. As we waited, we heard a lady walk by with the checks for her table and say \\"this place is a piece of s***.\\" Clearly we weren't the only ones having terrible service. It suddenly clicked why this place was so empty. We were unhappy with how much our checks ended up being for poor service and mediocre food, especially after the managers guarantee. I can't imagine how a place could fall off so much in a matter of months in terms of both service and food. Overall, this place is much better suited for the show Bar Rescue than for a good burger. I won't be back."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"can you get worse donut without going to Salem?  \\nDon't want to give this place any lip service beyond that."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"OK, I've slammed every pizza place I've reviewed.

If you didn't grow up eating grandma's home-cooked soul food, there will much many items on the menu that you won't recognize. While some dishes are standard amongst us all, others like the ox-tail and pot-likker might not be so familiar. \\n\\nRest assured, however, this isn't just a tourist trap. Even though, an endless number of media outlets have exploited this place, it's been fortunate to retain its character and true Southern hospitality. This is a fun place to eat dinner whether you're with the family or friends. The servers are pleasant, helpful and carry on the tradition that was established here before I was born. \\n\\nAs for the food, some of it is average and other dishes are exceptional. We sampled a decent portion of the menu between the five of us and raved about some of the main courses and would pass on others. Nothing was poor, but some things out paced others. \\n\\nMy favorite was the meatloaf. It was meaty, tender, not dry and the tomato-based sauce complimented the meat well. It wasn't the normal fake soul food restaurant that dumps ketchup on the top and calls it homemade. I felt like I was eating someone's grandma's meatloaf. We also couldn't get enough of the chopped sirloin topped with mushrooms, gravy and onions. The hand formed pattie was the right size, by not being a thick hamburger, which enabled it to be cooked so it wasn't well done and the onions and mushrooms were seared to where both were tender and the addition of the brown gravy pulled it all together. \\n\\nWe also tried the chicken fried chicken with white peppered gravy, shrimp and grits and chicken dumplings. The chicken fried chicken was good because it was fried to perfection. Upon clearing the plate there was no sign of grease or oil residue, which is a sign it was cooked properly. The shrimp with cheese grits had real cheddar cheese it in and reminded of food we'd eaten in Savannah, where they sure know how to make grits! As for the chicken and dumplings think Cracker Barrel. \\n\\nThere's so many different sides available, you won't be able to try them all. Meanwhile, the sweet potato casserole gave new meaning to sweet. This is my favorite side anywhere and was too sweet for me, but I was able to handle one bite and tasted incredible. Eating the entire thing would have put me into diabetic coma and I'm not diabetic. The black eye peas didn't tasted canned and the collard greens, mac n cheese and solid, normal choices and the fried okra wasn't greasy. All the sides compliment the main course well. \\n\\nThe desserts are made from scotch, in house and upon trying several of them, we believe they may have knocked the sugar container over on them. Even though they were extra sweet they were all delicious. The pecan pie, banana pudding and brownie might consume enough sugar (each of them) to keep you awake all night, but there's no doubt these weren't ordered from a food distributor.

You're made to feel as if you're an inconvenience, but this is forgivable if the quality of food is worth the effort. In this case, it is not - in any way whatsoever - worth the effort (let alone the cost). As an appetizer, we ordered the beef tartare, which was the highlight of the evening. While not a traditional tartare, it was an interesting, refreshing interpretation. It was likewise a hearty portion, definitely worth the $14 price tag. The main courses on the other hand (both fish), were underwhelming at best. Both dishes (swordfish and corvina) were overcooked, which was especially unfortunate given the apparent freshness of the corvina. Both dishes were strikingly bland; I didn't realize an otherwise beautiful cut of fish could be so tasteless. And I swear this is not an exaggeration: the swordfish tasted almost exactly like canned white tuna. I was hoping that the server would at least ask if everything had been to our liking, but alas, she simply took our plates and handed us the bill.

However, since it is just me today on my drive back to Dallas, I was able to be seated right away at the bar in front of the kitchen. It is fun watching the pizza being made, and then cooked in the deck oven.

The sauce has a nice strong tomato flavor.\\n\\nGot my pizza at 3:30 pm, and it was really good. The crispness of the crust was top notch, and better than most pizza places I've eaten. Since this white pizza was so good, I decided to have one with their red sauce the next time I came.\\n\\nMy next visit didn't come until several month later when I actually went next door to More Home Slice with my younger sister and her boyfriend.

(Please be aware that slices come as-is, and you can't add any extra toppings.)\\n\\nAs before, the crust had an excellent crispness, and while the pepperoni was good, I found the sausage and onion to be surprisingly better.  This might be due in part because the pepperoni seemed a little greasy. The next time I visit, I think I'll get a whole sausage pie, with extra sausage. However, if I change my mind and and have pepperoni, I'll add mushrooms to capture some of the grease.\\n\\nSo far, I've been able to find two pizzerias that are soy-free here in Austin.

The only thing that some kind of flavor was the pastor BUT I stopped eating it after my second bite as it was nothing but FAT and NOT MEAT. I thought the rice was okay.

Flour tortillas are thick and horrible.\\n\\nWhat hubby got: Beef fajitas enchiladas topped with gravy and cheese. Hubby says it was very very very BLAND. All the gravy (red sauce) hid the dryness of the meat. Refried beans were alright, nothing special.

When we get to the counter we order a ton of stuff:\\n\\nThe Voodoo Doughnut - donut covered in chocolate and filled with raspberry jelly. Shaped like a person and stabbed in the heart with a pretzel.

What I like about VooDoo Donuts is that the Donut itself is not laden with sugar. It is perfectly cooked and it isn't dry or too sweet. There also isn't this residual fat taste that you get in your mouth after you eat a donut. The icing on all of the VooDoo donuts are all very sweet and in my opinion intolerable. That's why the saltiness of the bacon counterbalances the super sweetness of the icing. I think that I would have liked the other donuts had the icing been not prepared too sweet. \\n\\nI think everyone should come here at least once to try the donut and see the huge array of designs.

We show up and the place is packed, so I am looking forward to a good meal.  \\n\\nI went for the Salmon Filet and my friend ordered the caprese salad.  The salmon was dryer than a charcoal briquet and the vegetables were bland and mushy.  Now if I was at a bar and paid $7 for this meal, fine. This place is called Pescatore and you charges $20 for this dish!!!  Also, my grandmother's cat can cook a decent piece of salmon without much effort.\\n\\nThe bar tender asked us if the meal was ok and I told him the fish was a little over cooked.  I have only sent food back to the kitchen, maybe, three time in my life.  The manager came over and took the salmon back to the kitchen. \\n\\nWhen the manager asked, my friend pretended like the caprese salad was better than it was so we didn't seem like the buzz kill group.  Let's face it, it's tough screw up a caprese salad.  At the same time, a chef should know when a tomato is ripe and juicy and whet it's hard as a rock.  The caprese salad a Pescatore was what I would expect if I ordered a caprese salad from McDonald's.  \\n\\nI got my salmon 20 minutes later.  It was cooked right, but still didn't taste that great.

The restaurant was very appealing to view, tastefully decorated and the open kitchen was fun to watch. We ordered drinks while we waited for our table and we were soon seated downstairs. We ordered the Yuca and the vegetarian Causa which were good. We also ordered the quinoa encrusted chicken and the potato tortilla which were not that great. The chicken was dry and hard and the potato dish was very bland. The specialty drink my friend ordered when we got there was horrible, it was made with Almond milk and was so bad, she left most of it behind. We ordered the small plates for $9 each but the portions were very small so we were still hungry after 4 plates and bread. We were considering ordering dessert but the dinner was not that great so we decided to go somewhere else for dessert. Not a very good meal."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not sure what the hype is here.

You really leave with about $35 per person after tax and tips because nothing here adds up perfectly to the $24.\\n\\nThe lounge menu prices are pretty fair and same goes for the drinks. The Absolute Elyx 52 - Elyx Vodka, Chambord, Champagne ($13). Martini was not very balanced in flavour so it's not a drink I'd order again.

We made reservations and still had to wait a little before we were seated.  When we mentioned it to the hostess, she stated that they had just opened. It was Noon, and they are supposed to open @ 11am.  Go figure.  They were getting a late start and it was obvious.  The staff looked tired and they were not very friendly.  I mentioned how everyone was looking to the manager (Louis) and he stated that they had a late night on Saturday night and things didn't shut down until 3am (Sunday morning).  In any event, the same staff should not open an establishment, that closed down the establishment under 8 hours before.  The morning after staff should have been WELL prepared for the Sunday brunch crowd.  Did I mention we were there from out of town?  My cousin and his fiancee was showing us around and taking us to the \\"hot spots\\" in Atlanta.  We are from Washington DC.\\nAfter seated, we were brought water by one man, and then Jassime or Yasmine as going to serve us.  She seemed bubbly and ready to serve us.  Well after the water was brought to us, she told us they moved her to another section and the manager (Louis) will be serving us.  He came to the table and did not say a word, I had to ask him how he was doing.  He seemed to be preoccupied and not very happy.  The restaurant was cold and uninviting when we first got there.  There was not any background music playing and we asked about it.  Louis told us that the DJ from the night before blew the speakers.  Not good.......it took away from the ambiance.  We finally got our first round of Bottomless Mimosas IN PLASTIC CUPS brought by the manager!  Unbelievable in an upscale restaurant.  \\n\\nAfter receiving our cup of juice in plastic cups, we were then greeted by another server/waitress - Jaressa.  She was a breath of fresh air after the air was getting stale by the minute before her arrival.  We were actually about to leave until she arrived.  She was pleasant, friendly, and a hard working young lady.  She heard our concerns and made it right!  The only thing she could not fix was the music.  Not her fault of course.  Our food was good, no complaints about the food and we received glasses with our Mimosa from Jaressa.  Jaressa seems to bring a positive vibe to the establishment.  She is a keeper if this establishment remains open.  She is the reason for the 4 stars.\\n\\nSince T.I's name is attached to this restaurant, I am CERTAIN he would not be happy about the way it is being managed.  Some of the men were coming downstairs like they slept there, literally.  Came down, checking out the scene and trying to get it together from the night before.  Not a good look @ all.  Dapping up some of the guests in their flip flops and then going back upstairs.  \\n\\nWe also took a tour of the establishment after we ate and it is decorated nice.  Good Job on that............seems like they need a night cleaning staff immediately after the establishment is closed from the previous evening and not have the staff coming in cleaning, running the dishwasher and scrambling for the things that they need. There was supposed to be a day party starting @ 3pm.

I'm a young Midwest girl traveling on a budget, so if I'm going to be spending $100 on a meal for two, I want to be sure that that food is the best I've ever tasted. \\n\\nAfter much back and forth I finally decided that Union Oyster House was worth a trip. Having seen many positive reviews on the raw bar, we opted to skip a full blown meal and snack on some oysters instead our way through the Freedom Trail. This ended up being the perfect decision in order to experience the history of this restaurant without spending a lot. Not only was the raw bar an intimate and fun experience, the oysters were fresh and reasonably priced. You'll be elbow to elbow with your fellow tourist, but this just adds to the nature of the small raw bar. The oyster shuckers are amusing and friendly. Here you'll truly feel the neighborly love of Boston. After telling the oyster shucking staff we were from Chicago, he proceeded to dump a handful of Union Oyster House coasters into my purse, \\"as a souvenir\\". At $11.95 - $14.95 a half dozen, you'll be able to skip the wait for a table, try some true Boston delicacies, and say you've eaten at the Oldest Restaurant in America without maxing out your vacation budget.\\n\\nIt's a win-win situation. Now I still can't say whether or not the dining food is worth the price, but I can say that the Raw Bar is a great alternative. \\n\\nWhile you're there, be sure to sample Sam Adam Colonial Ale. Sam Adams specially brews a unique beer for this restaurant, and this restaurant only. It is the only place you will be able to try it, so if you're a craft brew lover - do not miss this. \\n\\nAll in all, Union Oyster House keeps its historical ambiance and provides a wonderful raw bar experience. So plop down where history once sat, shoot a oyster back, and enjoy the Boston love because there aren't many places like this one."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Sangria!

I typically order maki sushi that has hot food in it such as eel or tempura.  Judging by how cold the food was by the time I got through traffic and reached the restaurant, and this has happened more than once, they must have cooked the food before my order arrived on the web.  I finally understood why I kept getting cold food when once by some miracle the traffic allowed me to get there early, and there I found my order already sitting there getting cold well before I could have been expected to arrive.

The person that seated us seemed friendly enough.\\nThe beer selection is a bit limited but I can't fault them here.

Of course, they can't really get points for a beer they merely pour into a glass so if I was reviewing Mac & Jack's it'd be a whole new review...\\nWe decided to split a meal (as we were only mildly hungry) and so we ordered the Maffee which is billed as 'lamb sauteed in a peanut sauce with bell peppers and onions and served with white rice\\". We also opted for a side of couscous. After ordering this is where my wife points out that the waiter seemed a little creepy and strange (which we later found was a common thread reading other reviews).\\nOur meal arrived and the rice seemed like it was left over minute rice from the previous day, very dry and not appealing. The 'peanut' sauce was almost like they put some Skippy in a pan and stirred it around. The lamb as overcooked and could almost pass for a jerky but I'm not sure I'd even have wanted my canine friend at home to try it. The couscous? Oh, I won't even go there...I'm not sure it was even couscous. In the end, I'd rather chew off my wife's leg out of desperation then eat here again.

Service is friendly and prompt, so I suspect that the delay on food is in the kitchen itself.  \\n\\nLunch entrees are $8, $9 or $10, and the price includes (in the case of sandwiches) sweet potato fries, potato salad or a market salad (which is actually local).  Appetizers are $6.\\n\\nFor my first lunch, I had the Seitan Ruben with sweet potato fries -- it was really tasty and very filling.  The toasted bread of the sandwich didn't get soggy from either the kraut or the seitan & sauce, even on the plate side.  All textures worked well together, and flavors were balanced nicely between savory, sweet and sour.  My only criticism is that I'd personally like a little more sauerkraut, but that's my particular taste.\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries were fries, not chips nor chunks nor steak fries, but just the normal sized sort of french fries you'd get at any restaurant.  They were the absolute epitome of sweet potato fries, so if you like that sort of thing that's enough reason to go to Leaf. \\n\\nMy friend had the Artichoke Po Boy and one of the soups of the day (broccoli cheddar cheese soup) and proclaimed both excellent.  I noticed that the soup looked to be richly textured, rather than just chunky or pureed, so I should have tried a spoonful when offered it, but I was too enamored of the ruben at the moment.\\n\\nI noticed someone nearby having what looked like a delightful plate of noodles, and everything that I saw come out of the kitchen looked very appetizing.  The food is nicely presented and the portions I saw look to be large for my appetite level.  I wasn't able to finish my lunch, nor was my friend, so we boxed up leftovers for later.\\n\\nWe both got out of there for just under $10 each, which is more than I usually want to spend on lunch, but fine for occasional noshing.  For the upscale atmosphere and presentation, $10 for lunch is a deal.\\n\\nOn my second lunch, I had the Thai Mango Curry.  It was nicely presented, cooked perfectly, and tasted good, but it's not a well-composed dish when it comes to the texture of its components and their pairing. For example, the chef's choice of broth with the rice noodles wasn't a good one--the threadlike noodles need a stickier, thicker or drier sauce, which is why you'll find them served as such at any Thai restaurant.  The brothy sauce made it a bit slurpy and sloppy to eat as well as difficult to get a forkful of the slippery noodles.  Also, the large chunks of bok choy, tofu and sweet potato look great plated with the noodles, but it's difficult to cut cooked bok choy into forkable pieces with a table knife.  Along the same lines, the sauce lacked sufficient punch (why call it Thai if it's not spicy?) to counter the beige blandness of the tofu, although it was perfect with the sweet potato.\\n\\nFrom a contextual perspective, I'd say this is one of the better restaurants in Boulder, but not perfect for the critical palate of a foodie. I'll definitely go there again to try other menu offerings as well as their happy hour."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great donuts, defiantly a tourist thing... donuts were super sweet.

I also like that you can choose a serving size, which makes having trying other dishes that they have on the menu more of a possibility. However, if you're looking for spicy, Totto is the way to go. We've tried their version of spicy ramen, and it's just not spicy enough. And we're not the type of people looking to make our food so spicy that you can no longer feel your taste buds, but we do like lots of heat. \\n\\nI love that they provide a small basket for every party to hold your belongings in so that it doesn't have to sit on the floor. It's such a small gesture, but it makes a big difference on our first impression and overall experience.\\n\\nI didn't have the greatest experience my very first time here. My boyfriend and I ordered additional toppings for our ramen, and it didn't come out with our food. I waited for a solid 10 minutes before our waiter realized I hadn't touched my bowl. I thought maybe it was on its way out, but I ordered corn and butter - this shouldn't take any prep time at all. He was very apologetic, and I knew it wasn't his fault. But he brought out my toppings right away, and all was well again. Mistakes happen every once in a while, and you gotta let the little things go.

Doughnuts are covered in cereals (Cap'n Crunch, Count Chocula, Rice Krispies), peanut butter, oreos, candies, sprinkles, and a host of other goodies.  Boyfriend had the famous Maple Bar - a maple doughnut with bacon (yes, bacon).  While bacon is the culinary accessory du jour, you still have to give these people props for such a feat.\\n\\nVoodoo is cash-only, but prices were surprisingly reasonable, so I'd imagine you can scrape together that much change out of the bottom of your purse.\\n\\nVegans, rejoice - practically every doughnut (minus the aforementioned Maple Bar, of course) are offered vegan-style.

Very bad combo. We also had some beef tartar, it came with a quail egg on top but the egg was very cloudy looking and everything had a bit of an off taste.

The atmosphere was great, so we were happy to have a long dinner, except that we were planning to see a concert that night (we'd planned about 2 hours for dinner, but it was getting tight). We mentioned it to the waiter, and he explained that there was a back-up in the kitchen, but that he would do everything he could. The manager also stopped by to say he understood we were on a schedule, and that he'd work on it and comp part of our meal for the inconvenience. I was really impressed at just how attentive they were and how seriously they took our desire to get to the concert, even though we hadn't mentioned it in advance (when we first sat down). \\n\\nShortly after, our main course came - halibut, which was very good, along with a side of mushrooms and the basmati fried rice.

Really, for a $15 appetizer, they can't use real dishes? The softshell crab was really disappointing- greasy, fishy-- I've had much better in Montreal. It was also really ugly-- it came atop a heap (literally, probably 3 inches tall) of really oily rice, and dotted with greasy sugar-snap peas. Weird. 80s. The seafood in a sherry sauce was sickening.

It looks like chicken, smells like chicken and tastes like a bland sponge.  Everything is perfect except for the taste.  Just because it's in a trailer on South Congress doesn't make it great.  This trend should be left to larger cities, not Austin, it's just a crummy fad.  Eating lamb gyros from a cart in New York City, yes!  Eating fried chicken from this trailer in Austin with all the other options, No.  The chicken is dark with a reddish hue, I guess to imply flavoring, must be paprika.  It was moist, not dry, fried to perfection just void of flavor.  You want spicy chicken stick with Popeye's or Heaven forbid a Chick-fil-a.  I wish I was lying, but that \\"newish\\" McDonald's southern fried chicken sandwich is better than this flavor-wise.  If you just have to walk somewhere and eat, stick to the pizza joint right up the street.   I really wanted to like this place.  We went with a group of four.  We all pretty much agreed on the lack of flavor, we were disappointed.  The staff/wait person was nice, we chatted for a bit.  Just about all the reviews are right as far as the wait.  We were the only ones there and it took 20-25 minutes, which is okay.

Pricing and service are ok but the biggest disappointment is the food.\\n\\nFirst, the xiao long bao. Proper dumpling skin should be delicate, yet supportive of the meat and broth contents and easily give when eaten. Theirs was rubbery and too \\"tough\\", which I suspect the dough was overkneaded and the gluten was overdeveloped. The filling had good portion of broth but the way it was put together left the meat inside in bits and pieces, which doesn't give as satisfying of a bite.\\n\\nThe five spice popcorn chicken was decent but nothing special, though they were generous in fried basil. The five spice seasoning was minimal, to the point of not living up to the name. Definitely could use more white pepper. The breading was too breadcrumbly. Wei Wei in Sellwood has better popcorn chicken.\\n\\nThe pork and cabbage baozi was good, albeit pricy ($3 each). There was generous filling and the skin was of appropriate texture, rise, and size.\\n\\nThe worst thing about XLB was that all of their xiao long bao and baozi tasted oddly salty. Not overly salty, but tasted of a generically savory saltiness, as if they used MSG. Not saying they do use it but wouldn't be surprised if they do or use ingredients that are made with it. (Note: We all eat processed MSG all the time, more than we realize. It's in your chips, frozen meals, foodservice, etc. under the names \\"yeast\\", \\"yeast extract\\", or \\"autolyzed yeast extract\\".)\\n\\nThe place wasn't very busy during peak lunch hour.

I figured it was the perfect time and place for lunch.  \\nI looked at the menu outside and saw that they had a special turkey burger for thanksgiving and other non-traditional burgers, but since it was my first time I wanted to have a simple cheeseburger.  If they could make the basic burger then I could trust them to make something more elaborate.  I was tempted to try their milk shake but my appetite wasn't that big at the moment so I looked at the sides.  Since I had fries last night for dinner I wasn't interested in getting fries.  I saw pickle fries and was intrigued.  I have had them other places and enjoy them. \\nI entered the store and there were 2 young women behind the counter chatting and working.  One of them looked at me and gave me a curious look/greeting, kind of.  If there weren't customers inside I was expecting her to tell me they weren't open yet based on how she looked and barely reacted as I walked towards her.  Needless to say the reaction to my entering and walking to the counter made me feel as if I was disturbing or interrupting her and made me feel as if I was doing something wrong by being there.  \\nThat being said, after that she was polite enough.  I ordered a cheeseburger and the pickle fries and asked if they had water or bottled water.  She offered me still or sparkling and I paid and sat at the counter where I could pass the time watching the t.v.  I noticed as I sat at the counter there were pitchers of water and cups -- wish I was told that they had tap readily available.  I was looking around at the chalkboard menu and noticed that the fried pickles were spears.  I wanted to cancel my order but I was sure that they were already being fried and maybe I missed it on the paper menu outside.\\nMy order came out, my name was called and she brought it to where I was sitting at the counter.  The burger looked good and the pickle spears were huge - similar to the size of a corn dog.  The pickles were covered with a really thick, crispy batter.  I dipped one end in the sauce and burned the roof of my mouth.  This is not what I wanted or expected, since every other time I have seen fried pickles it has been chip form.  I let them cool and dove into my burger.  I love the soft bun and inside were traditional toppings, special sauce and a 5 oz. patty.  I took a bite and juice was running down my chip and onto my plate.  It was hard to tell, but the patty almost appeared really pink inside, I like medium rare but I was surprised to see a patty that thin and small to be that pink at points.  After a couple more bites I went back to the pickle spears.  I found that biting into them difficult with all the batter, because you would sometimes just get a lot of batter and little to no pickle.  The good version of fried pickles I have had I enjoyed because the batter was more of thin, tempura style batter.  This fried pickle was 75% batter and 25% pickle.  I would never get these again, I am not a fan of their fried pickle.  The burger was satisfying, but I would have preferred a patty that was either cooked more, maybe less fatty -- not sure, but there was something about the patty that made it appear a slightly uncooked at times.  Because the patty is very thin it does get lost amongst the bun and toppings, maybe if it was slightly thicker that would help.  \\nOverall, if I lived in the area i would be happy to try the burger again, but with more fixin's.  Maybe when things warm up I will go back to try the milkshake.  \\nOne final note is that the workers wear baseball caps.  In a food establishment it is standard to make sure your hair stays out of the food, so it is common to wear some sort of hat and have your hair pulled back.  However, there was one woman who had hair that hung almost half way down her back.  I don't understand why put a hat on and have most of your hair outside of it.  I recommend that in the future to have your employees pull their hair back and up so it doesn't fly around, and not just try and pull of a hipster look. \\nThis experience rates b/w 2 and 3 stars."},{"name":"Naked Pizza","address":"1331 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Upper Crust has some serious competition in Coolidge Corner.

It has a contemporary flare and is very comfortable. You order your steak from the counter and they serve it on China with real silverware. I tried the Filet Mignon with their Grilled vegetables. They had, had a big dinner service and were out of their seasoned potatoes so they replaced it with their salad. They tell you all steaks are cooked medium, but I asked for medium rare and they obliged. It was 7 ounces of tender, delicious, perfectly seasoned beef. They serve it pre-sliced with their homemade chimichurri sauce and the veg mix of grilled asparagus, red peppers, and onions. It was excellent.

Mary Mac's amazing Yelp reviews stood out to me and I found myself sitting in a restaurant surrounded by Georgia natives who clearly love everything about this place. It's not hard to see why. Mary Mac's exceptional service and food makes it a delight for both regulars and tourists alike. I especially love the historical vibe I get from the building; this establishment seems to be firmly rooted in the Atlanta culture. \\n\\nAs for the food, there were some shining moments and some bites that fell short. We ordered the chicken pot pie, meatloaf, and the chicken fried chicken as well as a great selection of sides to taste. I want to start off by saying all of the dishes really delivered on flavor. The whipped potatoes, cheesy grits, and sweet potatoes were some of the best I've ever had. I would definitely also recommend getting the godly fried tomatoes before your meal and trying the cornbread. As first time diners, the server brought us free individual little soups (the name escapes me...) that were equally as delicious.\\n\\nNow onto the less desirable part of the review. My chicken fried chicken I felt was a bit dry. I really expected a nice crunch on the outside and juicy chicken on the inside and I found very muted versions of both. I also expected the chicken pot pie to have a golden crust but instead I received a very doughy, stretchy top (I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to be.) My biggest complaint is perhaps the service and the price. Service was rather slow, which was understandable as the restaurant was very busy. When we got to our table, the floor was messy. We had to stand there and wait a while for a server to clean and pull apart the tables and set up. (We should not have been called by the hostess that early) There are a lot of particular rules in place that I found to be interestingly restrictive. For instance: no plate sharing, limited amount of refills, full party only seating, etc. As for the price, four plates of food (and four iced teas) ran us about $90 which is definitely more on the expensive side of southern cuisine. I did not expect the menu to be so pricey at a heartwarming soul food joint. \\n\\nWould I recommend friends to eat here? Definitely! You can really get a feel of the history that this place has (eating with locals is always a good sign that the food is good). Would I come here again? Ehh, probably not. For me, this was a one time experience for the sake of my wallet and my patience."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"OK, so Poor Calvin's has officially made it into my top 3.

The gouda mac and cheese needed seasoning or maybe a second cheese mixed in. And the collards and kale definitely needed seasoning as well, the only thing that added any flavor was the ham hock they're cooked with. \\n\\nAnother problem I had was the menu prices are a bit expensive for the amount of food you get. It might be different if the sides shined a bit more, but it feels like you're just paying for the bbq since the sides aren't that great, so the $12+ price tag for a plate is a bit much. \\n\\nThe decor was a bit strange too, it felt like a mix between a sports bar and a bbq joint and so you couldn't quite settle into a vibe.

Good thing she was friendly and honest about what she liked and didn't like on the menu. I ended up with the brie, walnut and apricot tartine, while my sister ordered the sausage frittatas. I think I like the concept of the tartine (an open-faced sandwich) more then the tartine itself, but they had a great and unique selection. The fig and agave one piqued my interest. I'm happy with their portions, especially their brunch items which are pretty inexpensive. After the tartine, I experienced a carb-induced coma. Their chai latte is really good as well.

Unfortunately the fish smelled a bit funky. Big flop. The little brother had chicken fingers and fries- it was on the menu and on other kids plates. He ate them I didn't try. \\n\\nI had the seafood stew in coconut milk which had a fair bit of seafood but it had none of the lemongrass and other South Asian flavors I expected. I found it bland. The seafood was not funky.  My wife had the pernil Cubano which she liked. I tried it and it was good. \\n\\nPart of the disappointment was that I found it dirty.  Would it have been so difficult  to wipe down the tables? Ours was sticky. The children's play area has seen better days as well. I was happy when my kids washed their hands. Both the bathrooms and entire restaurant could use a remodel.  The food took a relatively long time to come of the kitchen, which is not an issue, but there was almost a 7-8 minute delay between the adult dishes and chicken fingers. Super casual is ok but putting food in front of the adults  before their kids does not simplify the parenting equation. \\n\\nIn the end, if you have very young children (preschool or younger) and need to eat out, this is an option where you can shell out a fair sum of money and not fret over kids  acting their age.

What can I say about this place that hasn't been said? Me and a couple of friends were visiting Atlanta for the week. We had heard good things about it so we decided to give it a try. omg. First of all, we were surprised by the location (in an industrial looking building at the rear of some obscure parking lot). So we pull up and they have complimentary valet parking. Nice touch. It was 20 something degrees that night so that was appreciated. The restaurant itself was niiiiiiice. Very lofty and industrial but warm at the same time. Very modern. So at this point we're all thinking the same thing....the drinks and food prices must be outrageous. Big surprise...the food was actually reasonable. Um ok so if it's reasonable, they're going to skimp on the food. More on that later. The waiter comes up and he's wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans. His demenaor and his clothes were very casual. I like that. I'm not into stuck up waiters who are too cool/cute to be working where they're working. He was knowledgable about the food and drinks also. One friend got the salmon chips which we loved and me and the other friend got the steak. Healthy portions all around. The only complaint would be that the bathroom was a let down. This is one of those places where you can't wait to go to the bathroom because you know it will be all marble and glass with waterfalls and chandeliers. Not so. It almost seemed like they ran out of money when they get to the bathrooms. Ok. Not going to let that stop me from returning as I don't go to a restaurant for the restroom.

Except for the size of the crowd and the notoriety of the place, it was pretty similar to the places my grandmother used to take us after church back home in Mississippi. The food is wonderful if you are looking for authentic, traditional Southern food as opposed to a Southern inspired gourmet or modern menu. Not every item on the menu is exactly perfect, but it's all pretty good and some of it is really excellent. Great fried chicken, pimiento cheese, and veggies. The atmosphere was nice and homey except for the whole touristy \\"Don't forget this is Mary Mac's Tea Room and Jimmy Carter or Somebody Like That Ate Here and We Sell T-Shirts By the Way,\\" vibe that came with it.

I do want to point out our experience at the shop though; I am horribly allergic to maple to the point that I don't even trust places when they say the are using maple flavoring because I was told that somewhere before and had to use my epi-pen as my throat was closing up, that said; I asked the cashier who helped us if she wouldn't mind just taking the maple flavored doughnuts and just tossing them in a bag so that they were separate from the rest but so she wouldn't have to spend a lot of time accommodating my allergy so she could get to the rest of the line.  She said no problem, she didn't want to squish the doughnuts, so she took the time to box the maple ones in their own box.  As we were paying and I was thanking her profusely my husband mentioned to me that his back was starting to hurt from walking around downtown all day and the cashier asked him if he wanted some aspirin, he said yes, she went to the back gave him a cup of aspirin (so he would have more for later if he needed it) and also brought a glass of water to take them.

To start with the best foot forward, the service was awesome (as most in Portland is apt to be I've noticed), and the iced coffee, I dunno if it's just cause I was so tried and needed it, but it hit the spot perfectly. We didn't want to wait for a seat outdoors to open up, but that area looked quite nice. The most important part of the burger, the actual meat, was awesome, tasted great, cooked just right, juicy as hell. However the rest seemed a bit of a let down for the price. The fries weren't soggy, but they lacked any real crispiness. The burger had like 3 rings of an onion, and small ones at that.

It wasn't even that spicy.  I dipped everything, including the complimentary bread, with the salsa, so much so that I had to ask for more.  \\n\\nI'll note here briefly that the bread also comes with three salsas of their own.

It was a decent portion, and I appreciated the flavor and texture of the slow cooked lamb.  It was super easy to eat since the meat basically fell off the bone.

But it's a freaking burger and fries for gods sake. Didn't ask for a well done stake and souffl√©. I figured I was waiting because they had to make the food to order being so close to closing. I was wrong. Fries were cold and completely inedible. The burger was COMPLETELY smashed!! This was no accident. This was a big \\"FU** YOU\\" to me for interrupting their close.

You go to an Asian place and its basically lobster pieces wrapped in a wonton wrapper and deep fried, served with some mayo. So when I saw Lobster wonton with cream cheese and mango kaviar glaze I was expecting much of the same. Man, am I glad I ordered this. This could very well be the best thing I've eaten all year. Lobster and cream filled into a wonton, which was shaped more like flattish ravioli than a round wonton. Which is brilliant because then the flat top of it can hold the caviar, crispy onions, fried seaweed (or maybe kale or soemthing?) the mango glaze balsamic and tomato. Or close enough. And holy crap is it good. Just. Wow. \\n\\nThe fried chicken with sweet potato and bacon waffle was pretty solid too. Chicken was fried well (more of a chicken cutlet) and the waffle was pretty interesting. It's a soft waffle, not a crispy one, which I prefer with the chicken and waffle since the chicken is already crisp. The bacon touch was interesting and the sweet potato lent a different texture and a Slight sweetness to it. \\n\\nCame in for brunch on a Sunday and the place was packed.

Honestly, opt for a bit of the crushed chillis rather than any of the sauce. Its not needed (and both of us constantly use a lot of both types). \\nThe services was good, not incredibly fast but this is the type of place that you'll want to take your time. \\nThe decor was much nicer than many other places, not quite fine dining ish but pleasant and clean. \\n\\n2 spring rolls (6) and 2 large pho (8 each) came to 24.50 after tax.

It seemed like she was kind of letting out baggage on her experience with other tables and made an awkward vibe like we were getting lectured.

Perhaps the first meal or two were just plain misses. If you decide to eat here, then definitely try to go for a weekday lunch. The lunch specials are only $5 including tax. This can't be beat by anyone within a mile radius, if not more. For that, you get a ridiculous amount of rice (I usually have enough left over for a second meal) and a huge amount of actual food. However, expect only one piece of an appetizer, e.g. Peking Ravioli would be better termed Peking Raviolo. Nonetheless, you'd be extremely full if you actually consume everything.

Each dish is not only gorgeous; it's packed with inventive and delightful flavors.\\n\\nAMBIANCE:  Andina is a gorgeous restaurant.  The interior is filled with bright colors that compliment the deep brown wood floors and copper table tops.  The main dining area has rows of colorful booths adjacent to tables covered with crisp linens and sparklingly clean dishware.  An entire wall of the restaurant is lined with windows and the wood ceiling is illuminated with soft, soothing track lighting.  Every element of this restaurant is beautiful and inviting.\\n\\nMENU: Vegetarians rejoice!  The menu at Andina is vegetarian friendly and vegan friendly.  In fact, if you're having trouble navigating your way through the standard menu, simply mention that you're vegetarian and your server will bring you the vegetarian menu. \\n\\nFOOD: As is standard practice when dining with my boyfriend, we allowed our server to surprise us with whatever she thought we would enjoy the most based on our individual diets (he eats meat and I do not).  To start, we were served two small appetizers called Causa.  We had the Causa Solterito which was a small cake made with mashed potatoes infused with key limejuice topped with finely chopped green bean, cheese and avocado.  The second Causa was comprised mostly of red quinoa topped with red onion, fresh chopped herbs and avocado.  Each little cake had its own distinct combination of flavors, and the finely chopped herbs and vegetables allowed for a different combination of flavors in each bite. \\n\\nFor my entr√©e, our server went the extra mile and asked me if I would feel like I was eating too much quinoa for dinner if my meal came with a side of quinoa.  I told her I love quinoa and an extra serving would be no problem, but she suggested that I allow her to substitute the quinoa with a pilaf dish she would ask the chef to make especially for me.  I was in great spirits and feeling adventurous, so I encouraged her to bring me whatever she wanted.  So she brought me the Hongos Saltados which was the most incredible wok-fried mushrooms I have ever tasted.  Honestly, I want to know how Peruvians have mastered the mushroom.  The mushrooms were tossed with onions, tomatoes and garlic and served with a conservative stack of small fried potatoes.  The side dish was the pilaf our server had mentioned and it was delightfully buttery - in fact, it was my favorite flavor of the meal.   \\n\\nThe pilaf was my favorite food flavor, and I drank at Andina what is now my all time favorite cocktail.  I just wish it wasn't all the way in Oregon because I've been lusting for one ever since.  The drink is called SacsayHuaman (pronounced \\"Sexy Woman\\") and it's the best damn drink you'll have in your life.  It's comprised of habanero pepper infused vodka (yes, habanero) shaken with passion fruit and sugar cane served in a glass with a sugar rim and topped off with a cilantro leaf for garnish.  It's a divinely sweet drink with a spicy little kick that warms the body to its core. \\n\\nI insisted that I did not have room for dessert, but my boyfriend ordered dessert anyway.  I resolved to have just one bite, but after just one bite, I ended up eating my half of the entire dessert.  We were served the Canutos De Quinoa Y Maracuya; in other words crispy quinoa cannolis filled with passion fruit mousse served with mango-lemongrass sorbet.  They chef had even gone to the trouble to write Feliz Cumpleanos in tiny wisps of dark chocolate on the dessert plate.  Because of the passion fruit, it was the first dessert I've had that wasn't heavy and actually left me feeling refreshed.\\n\\nSERVICE: We always know we're going to get good service when our sever gets excited about surprising us.  The fact that our server went out of her way to offer me an alternative side dish to avoid redundancy and to expand our taste experience means that we left her an incredible tip.  She was never pretentious or fake, but completely sweet and honest, open and caring.  She took excellent care of us throughout the entire meal, making this my top overall dining experience. \\n\\nPRICE: Andina is a bit pricey, by my budget standards, that is.  Prepare to save your dollars before eating here as entrees average $20.00 and make sure to call ahead for reservations.  And more importantly, make sure to dine at Andina to treat yourself and your palate"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went there twice as a tourist.

I was sick out both ends for 24 hours. I suspect the Frutti Di Mare, and maybe it's my fault for ordering seafood in Colorado from a restaurant owned by Chipotle, but for these prices I expected better quality. That's not even the whole reason I would give zero stars if that were an option. The bad design layout, the price point, and the secrecy of the partnership with Chipotle always bothered me. The horrible food poisoning just forced my hand to write this negative review. The place feels cramped; everybody is sitting on top of each other and the decor resembles a bathroom. Way too tight for parties over four, but not suited for dates either because you're sitting on your neighbors lap and the poor ambiance kills any potential romance. Servers have to bump into patrons to get around. Acoustic design is equally awful: tile surfaces, open kitchen, loud music and lack of bafflers combine to make it hard to have a conversation or order food. You literally have to shout into each other's faces. It also smells like fryer grease in the whole place and makes your clothes smell. If you get a table near the one coed bathroom, pray nobody poops. Every time I've been in, it's a struggle to get a good table then a long wait to get \\"the best pizza in Boulder\\". When it finally arrives, everyone at the table looks at each other like, \\"WTF? Did they forget to slice it? Am I supposed to hack it apart with this dull butter knife?\\" We send it back to be sliced properly. The server cheerily informs us that they serve it that way because it's \\"Neapolitan Style\\". I don't mind unsliced pizza in a romantic setting in Naples, but in a crowded restaurant it's a pain in the butt and also a bit gimmicky. The pies do not fit on the small tables and they don't supply pizza trays. Amateurish. Despite claims of being gourmet, the pizza is just okay. Overall the place seems to have an identity crisis and doesn't know if it's a high-end restaurant or a fast-casual joint. Priced like the former, tastes and feels like the latter. Neapolitan pizza (in my experience from eating it in Naples) has a subtle brown crust and is a tiny bit soupy in the middle but not undercooked. At Locale the outer crust is burnt to a black flakiness that turns to an ashy dust when you bite it, while the center is still raw dough. In Naples you can usually see the sauce through the cheese and toppings are usually basic and sparse. At Locale the cheese is barely there at all and the toppings are the one redeeming feature but they seem to have been flung haphazardly in the general direction of the pie. Some parts have too many toppings, others none. You can't call pizza \\"Neapolitan\\" just because the pies are small and unsliced. They seem to have adopted only the inconvenience of not slicing it without perfecting the process to achieve the correct texture which is the whole reason for leaving the pie whole to begin with. Oven temp and timing is off and they don't comply with the strict ingredients required to be true Neapolitan pizza. I forgive the chef for not being trained in Naples. Just don't call it Neapolitan and use that as an excuse not to slice it unless it actually is Neapolitan pizza. It's not the worst pizza I've had, just misrepresented and certainly not worth the premium pricetag. I feel bad for the servers having to navigate such a cramped floor carrying overpriced and poorly cooked pies, explaining 20-30 times per night why the pizza has not been sliced. I bet their tips suffer. Not to mention the headache from working in an echo chamber or the sore throat from having to shout over and over again that the pizza is \\"Neapolitan\\", when it clearly misses the mark. All of this might be forgivable if it didn't cost so much. For the price of getting a good wine buzz and a full stomach here, you could fly to Italy to get a real pizza then fly to Japan to have it sIiced by a Samurai. It also seems a little disingenuous to pose as strictly a Frasca creation when it's also a chain owned by Chipotle. Frasca prices, Chipotle quality. It's also annoying that the Denver locations have the same pies (albeit 2 inches smaller) for literally half the price as the Boulder location. I would give zero stars if it were an option, without even factoring in the food poisoning incident. The one default star is for the staff, who have been friendly. Protos, Da Lupo, Basta, or Backcountry are all better options in Boulder. But by far the best pizza in the county is up in Nederland at the new Crosscut Pizza! They have a better oven/chefs and achieve a much closer approximation of the Neapolitan crust. Their toppings are more creative and generously distributed. Crosscut's pizza is so good, they could claim to be a branch of Masa when they're actually owned by McDonalds, leave their pizza unsliced, wrap it in tin foil, and serve it accompanied by a live heavy metal band and I'd still go there. As for Pizzarhea Chipotle, not so much.

These were all tasty, with the butternut squash being a clear winner.  The cayenne sweet potatoes were also championship status - and overall all of my veggies were good.

The 3 types of dips offered with the bread, don't seem to pair well with their bread they served, however the mango dip was really good. Their dishes has nice wholesome flare to them, but nothing really \\"pops!\\" - which was a bit disappointing.  The ambiance is lively and great for dates. However, we had a waitress that didn't come around until we were seated over 15 minutes. When we finally asked another server to take our drink order, she somehow was able to appear and pushed him right out, and made us start over with our ordering. She was overly chatty (friendly?), eavesdropped on our conversation which became a bit overbearing. I've had much better Peruvian food for half the price in Orange County that had more excitement in their dishes."},{"name":"Sushi House","address":"2221 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Sushi was good, Service was awful.\\n\\nA relatively small restaurant,  sat at the sushi bar where we watched our order get skipped multiple times.

The service from the vallet in the parking lot, to the hostess, to our server was amazing. Everyone was very polite and made my girlfriend and I feel very welcome.

Our server was immensely knowledgeable about the menu, wine list, and what type of oyster I could get for my girlfriend to try (she had never had raw oysters). He knew the perfect balance of making sure our table was taken care of but not being over bearing in checking up every 5 minutes which I loved! Now the food.... I never thought that any seafood could be that good outside of Miami, The Keys, New Orleans, Baltimore and any of the rest of the famous seafood cities you can think of.... but I was wrong. The Optimist is. We had the peel and eat shrimp with a half dozen oysters for appitizers and they were incredible. Huge shrimp cooked perfectly and the oysters taste as though they were pulled out of the ocean that morning. Now on to the entree, my girlfriend, the red grouper with okra, myself, the swordfish with fried rice. All I can say is wow.... with fish there is a fine line that you cannot cross or go under otherwise it will be either over cooked or under cooked. The chef at the optimist is a master of that line. Both of our meals were cooked perfectly and seasoned to match. Neither were over seasoned so you could taste the freshness of the fish, but neither were seasoned close to the same! Both cuts had thier own unique flavor and were delicious! We had desert as well which to spare you another paragraph was incredible as well.

You'll want to keep on eating it.\\"\\n\\nBruh. \\n\\nThe specials came out to be more like hushpuppies with essence of salmon accompanied by yum yum, sriracha, and hoisin sauces. Then the $75 lobster special was fried rice. Are you kidding me?? Not even deshelled. There was only one cracker left.\\n\\nThe lobster was definitely overcooked because I couldn't get all of the meat out, even the head. The meat is supposed to flick out. You cannot justify charging that much for fried rice. The sales pitch was very misleading. I am not used to having to work so hard for FRIED RICE. I could've ordered one of the $34 lobster fried rice entrees off the regular menu which is deshelled and ordered something else to try. I lost my appetite halfway through eating it. I could have paid the same at Benihanas and gotten lobster, steak, shrimp, fried rice, and a show. I did not see any Thai influence in my dishes. Luckily the birthday boy loves fried rice.\\n\\nThe best part of my dinner was my cocktail. They have a nice selection of liquor.

I've eaten oysters there many times over the past nine years. I love raw oysters and always buy a bucket fir myself and when I'm with a fellow oyster lover I've been known to split three buckets! I've seen the price of a bucket go from $16.00 to the present $25.95, but still so worth it. I didn't count how many oysters are in the bucket but it was filled to the top. It's is estimated to be two and a half dozen .... thirty oysters! There are some huge oysters and a few small ones, but most are an average size. My favorite way to eat them is with a bit of horseradish on top of the oyster and their delicious house made cocktail sauce on top of the horseradish.\\n\\nThe ambience is very casual and friendly. Everybody eating next to me at the bar always makes conversation as do the oyster shuckers. Watching them shuck the oysters is a great show too.\\n\\nThe decor and bar is very old and has peeling paint. The oysters are served right on the bar, no plate, and when you finish an oyster just throw it over the bar into the sink that runs the full length of the bar.  If you want oysters on ice on a plate you can sit at a table instead of the bar but then you can't order a bucket at the table.\\n\\nYou also can get the oysters to go, shucked or not shucked.\\n\\nAnother thing I like about Lee and Ricks is that you eat oysters, you don't sit around and wait, you order them then they shuck the whole bucket and you eat while they are shucking. No waiting for a fancy presentation. Another plus is there is no need to dress up, wear your comfortable clothes, and if they happen to be a little dirty from a hike or from working outdoors, or from sweating at the park, don't worry about it!

We also ordered an entree to share which was the duck and OH MY GOSH let me tell you how friggen delightful it was. First they had already split it up so that we both had our own plate with some duck on it, the flavors were so intense I couldn't stop eating and the duck, the duck that came two ways, both ways were so tender or so crispy and perfect. The entire walk home we talked about what a memorable moment that was for us and how amazing the whole experience was.

My wife insisted we go here when we first started dating - bold move for a third date!  I had only eaten Korean food once or twice before, so it was still relatively new to me.  She was already a huge fan and MIn Ga quickly converted me.  \\n\\nThe place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall, very no frills vibe, set in a strip mall.  Inside is simple, usually a very diverse clientele - but it's reassuring to see quite a few Koreans eating the food.  And the food is outstanding.  The dokhpoki is my absolute favorite.  Rice cakes and fish cakes in a spicy sauce.  Love at first bite.  Apparently it's a street food in Korea, and made differently everywhere.  The dish at Min Ga is spicy and simple, no noodles or random things thrown in, just the fish and rice cakes.  Plus, it somehow comes out excellent every time I'm here - consistency is a key to why I love this place.\\n\\nMy wife is also a huge fan of their soups, which are great during the long long Ohio winters.  Goes great with a bottle of soju (Korean rice wine).  I usually also get the beef bulgogi or the hot stone bibimbap, Korean classics that are done perfectly here.\\n\\nService is good, a little slow at times but always friendly.  The kimchi spread, which is mandatory at any Korean place, is great - diverse array of kimchi and really well made.  Now that I've been here (and tried Korean places elsewhere) more times than I can count, I've come to conclude that the kimchi you get right off the bat is a sign of what sort of experience you can expect - and they get it right at Min Ga.\\n\\nOverall, 5/5 for sure.

Love the place, great ambience, etc., but the price-point is too high to be realistic. We were there on a Thursday night and there were maybe 10 other people in the place - not a good sign for a new place with a lot of hype. I'm sure it's because of the prices. We got a Brewer's Plate - a few slices of salami, cheese, and some olives for $16. A small side salad was $8.  If Hair of the Dog wants to succeed, they need to lower the prices to appeal to the bulk of the brewery goers in town. If I want to spend $16 on an appetizer-sized meat/cheese plate, it better be at an uber fancy place on a special occasion. Also, it couldn't hurt to have more of a selection of other breweries on tap, to compliment the house beer. They do have a couple of Caldera Brewing beers on tap, but a few more would make it more well-rounded.

I went here with some friends on a Friday night, expecting it to be jam packed, which it nearly was. We were told the wait was 45 minutes for our group of 8. However, luckily for us, we were quickly seated in a large room that was double booked for a party. Awesome, right? Yes. Very awesome.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Not really sure. The building is nice, but it feels like a big convention hall, just in a smaller space (if that makes any sense). There are many different rooms that are all abnormally large and spacey and awkwardly separated by rather narrow door frames. The decor was alright. It's the same kind of decor you'd find in other neighborhood-style restaurants - lots of pictures of famous people and some art.\\n\\nTHE FOOD: When you sit down, you are given a small sheet of paper and a menu. You're instructed by the waiter/waitress to write down what you want in the corresponding boxes on the paper. If you are a first time visitor, which all of us were, you get a complimentary pot likker. This was also awesome. The pot likker was a little bland, but if you add enough of the pepper sauce on the table, it gives it a good kick. As for the main dish, we had tried different things and were generally very pleased with what we ordered. I tried out the baked chicken with friend green tomatoes and spiced apples. The baked chicken, to my surprise, still had bones in it, which made for a rather difficult eat, but the texture was a much better surprise. The fried green tomatoes were to DIE FOR, I TELL YOU. So sweet and not too crispy. The spiced apples were just alright. My friend complained of her patty melt containing a little too much meat and her mac and cheese was a little sharp for her taste.\\n\\nSERVICE: Our two waitresses were very friendly and helpful. They were also very helpful with the menu (one of my poor friends had no idea what a potato cake was). They were also very attentive, which I found odd given that the restaurant was busy.\\n\\nOverall, I would say give it a try, even if you don't like heavy souther meals. You'll most likely be in for a pleasant surprise. Oh and that pot likker?

The seating here is family style and a highchair can be added on the end of any table, providing lots of seating options without waiting. Waiting with a baby sucks and often prevents parents with babies from going out, but PHP has you covered. Order pizza, set up highchair, feed baby, and then they bring the pizza to your seat. I usually order mine to go so it's pre-boxed and I can run out whenever my boy gets fussy without having to wait for a check, change, or flagging any wait staff. But PHP is also big, with open viewing of all patrons, so my son is thoroughly entertained by watching everyone and can stay here longer than most other places. It's not overly loud, people have always been polite and generous letting us set up at the end of a row where they might have to slide down a bit.\\n\\nIt's a parenting home run.

This place is hidden in a strip mall off of Buford, and it's not very big. The IMPORTANT thing to know is that you MUST make reservations if you plan to eat here for dinner Fri-Sunday. There are many 10 tables total, so the space isn't very big. When you first walk in, the male servers are all very nice, but the only female (and I can't tell if she's the manager, owner, all of the above) but she runs everything from hostess to taking your food to giving you your check at the end. You better go in knowing what you want because she doesn't mess around. She's also kind of pushy telling you to get this with that for an extra $2. At first, you're thinking, \\"yeah, $2 for this isn't fine...go ahead and add it on.\\" 5 things later and an additional $20 you're realizing how cunning this woman is. OK. so once you get pass the pushy lady at the front, the food is good for the price. It's the first and probably ONLY reasonable Indian restaurant I've been to here in Atlanta, and I've been to my fair share. The nan (from plain to garlic) are all extremely tasty; the teekhamasala is extremely tasty and very saucy which goes perfectly with either white or yellow rice wrapped in nan. Their paneer dishes are good too; though really, it's like 4 pieces of Indian cheese with tons of veggies covered in curry sauce. Like I mentioned previously, the price isn't bad; $3 for nan, and $10 for an entree is very fair in my opinion especially in today's day and age where everything is inflated and if a burger costs $12, lord knows what an Indian entree will cost ya! \\n\\nOH! and the best thing is...*drum roll please* is you can bring your own bottle(s) of wine for no cork fee charge!!!!!!

The takoyaki was one of the best takoyaki I've had in the U.S. - a good ratio of octopus to filling, delicious accompanying sauce, and a generous scattering of bonito flakes. As for the ramen, the broth has a good balance between flavor and healthiness - they definitely do not use MSG and the broth is creamy yet light - and the noodles had varied texture. I did think prices were a bit on the high side (but given its location in Harvard Square, completely justifiable), portions were smaller than what I'm used to (Hokkaido Ramen Santouka only gives you one slice of pork), and I was surprised that the egg cost extra. \\n\\nOverall, Hokkaido Ramen Santouka may not be my favorite ramen shop in Boston, but they made a strong case: their ramen is definitely healthier than other offerings in Boston without compromising on flavor and the service is very fast and attentive.

I guess just like in New York, you should never go anywhere that attracts a lot of tourists. I was so disappointed when I realised you do indeed pay for the view than for the food. I had such great expectations as Top of the Hub was not the first restaurant of its kind I dined in, but my experience was just... mediocre and for a ~100pp check, it was a big regret.\\n\\nI don't think you can ask for a window seat when you make a reservation, but they do tell you when you arrive that you can wait at the bar until a window table is open. I wish I had done that, as I decided not to wait and just sat behind the window tables and watched jealously as other couples enjoyed the view. The meal was just not worth it when you don't get to sit next to a window. \\n\\nI also expected superb service, since I watched our server talk to his other tables and engage in such deep conversation. I appreciate it when servers try to get to know you, who doesn't? Maybe we just gave off a vibe that we wanted our space, but it felt like we were the only table he didn't try to be very friendly with. I thought it was because we ordered wine pairings for each course in our meal and he might have thought we were underage, so he didn't want to talk to us? But I wasn't sure. \\n\\nOur first course, the spicy lobster soup, was TOO good. I'm a huge fan of creamy soups, and the lobster addition was just perfect. However, it quickly became too overwhelming to the point that I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish it. After that, the rest of our courses were nothing special and definitely not worth the price we paid for. We didn't finish our main entrees, and dessert wasn't amazing. \\n\\nMaybe come if you're a tourist and you get the chance to get a window table.

Whenever I am back in town, eating there is on my to-do list\\n\\nFood:  Southern style food at its realest.  Several styles of bread including amazing cornbread.  Succulent pork chops.  Falling-off-the-bone ribs.  Crispy chicken.  Incredible fried fish.  Topped off with delicious helpings of all your familiar favorite sides, like mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, fried tomatoes, greens, etc -- and tea that hits the spot every time!\\n\\nService:  The service has always been impeccable and professional.  The waitstaff always ask if any diners are new, and help them navigate the unique ordering system used by Mary Mac's.  Refills are always offered at the right time.  Diners are never neglected, nor are they inundated with obsequious waitstaff angling for tips.  The ONLY negative is that the wait for a table can be quite long at peak times and there is little room to sit in the small anteroom\\n\\nAtmosphere:  Mary Mac's is built like a large single-storey house on the inside, with several large dining rooms and a few long hallways.  Every wall is covered with photographs of famous diners.  There are Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, athletes (and some entire teams), scientists, musicians, and actors galore.  Trying to identify the subjects without reading the nameplates is a great way to pass the time while waiting for your table.  The only thing that may present an issue to some is the relatively high level of background noise: Mary Mac's is always packed with cheerful patrons, so if you prefer a quiet atmosphere it may not be for you.\\n\\nBottom Line:  If you are in Atlanta and you like southern food, get your butt to Mary Mac's!"},{"name":"Lao Shan Dong Homemade Noodle House","address":"4887 Kingsway, Suite 105","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"You've heard of Soup Nazi?

First, I'd like to say I pride myself on knowing a good breakfast when I eat one, I love making breakfast as well.  It is my favorite meal of the day, period.  With that said, I have an obsession with French Toast.  If I know a place has it, I will order it.\\n\\nFrom Redbug road in Tuscawilla area, you can hardly see the little shop.  But its there if you look hard enough.  South side of Redbug road at the corner of Tuscawilla and Redbug.\\n \\n  Walk in and you'll be greeted with a smile, then told to sit wherever you wish.  Picking a spot in the middle of the establishment so I could scope out the place,  I plopped down and waited.  \\n  A few seconds later the waitress walks over, realizes she told me to sit and didn't hand me a menu.  She hands me one and I look over the selections, just after she asks what I want to drink.  Typical selections of breakfast, \\"country style\\" mostly.  I was on a mission and French Toast was the goal.  \\n\\nThe waitress walks back with my coffee and water, then walks away and says she'll be back to take my order.   Hmm, I don't know why she couldn't take it then, the place was only 1/3 full and she wasn't busy.\\n\\nShe comes back, takes my order and I sit for 20 mins before my 3 slices of texas toast cut in halves comes out.  Yes, 20 mins.   I don't think that is a long amount of time if I had sides, or the place was busy.  But, I didn't order sides and even though they had customers, almost all had eaten as they were sitting and chatting only.  I didn't see but one other table eating.  \\n\\nAt first glance the French Toast looks good, however, looks are deceiving in this case.  The one issue that continues to plague most places withe making French Toast is that they allow the bread to soak in too much batter, then they do not cook it thoroughly so that the middle is done.  This is a major problem for me.  It probably should be pointed out that almost all restaurants warn against under cooked eggs, as salmonella can be caught this way.   I noticed this as my fork cut through the middle of the first slice of toast. \\n \\n Most do this, so I just try to enjoy the pieces that are cooked.  Immediately on my first bite I can taste onion and peppers... mmmm, right?  Nope, sorry, i didn't want the flavor of onions and peppers in my French toast.  This means the cook prepared them prior to my toast and used the same oil/grease on the stove.   blargh!!  Not wanting to wait another 20 mins for the same quality, i just continued.  \\n  I love the crust of French Toast, you know, the edges.  If done correctly, its like the crispy parts where all the goodness is collected.  Well, the crust around this break proved that the bread I was eat was super stale.  My fork could not even penetrate the crust with a level of force that it easily should.  *shrug*  At this point I gave up.  \\n\\nMaybe another trip to see how their other food is, however, I'm already skeptical.\\n\\nFood - 1\\nService - 3"},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is so over hyped.

The food is not exactly spectacular but it is solid and certainly not terrible.  Tonight my family of 5 showed up at 4 pm and requested to sit outside on the near empty patio (just one couple seated outside where there are 10-14 tables).  The manager was standing at the hostess station, though at the time I didn't know it was the manager, and he actually ROLLED HIS EYES.  I didn't assume it was for us, and we waited to be seated.\\nThe patio was basically empty, and our hostess told us to \\"choose a table and sit!\\"  We asked if we could push two tables together so we could accomodate  five people, as the tables seat four.  The hostess said fine.  Our waiter came out, took our drink order, and we were dining, or so we thought.\\nSoon the manager, the same young, thin, blond man with glasses that had rolled his eyes at us inside came out and told us, \\"I can't allow you to sit here.  It is happy hour, and these are our best tables.\\"\\nWe said, \\"There is no one here.  We have 5 people, and we can't fit in a four person table comfortably.  We need a little extra room.  What are we supposed to do?\\"\\nHe said, \\"It will probably get busy soon, so I need you to move.\\"\\nThe hostess already okayed this seating arrangement, and there was ONLY ONE OTHER OCCUPIED TABLE THERE.  We pointed this out and wondered why we should be uncomfortable NOW based on what MIGHT happen.  This young man allowed that we could sit here \\"For now\\" but when other customers start to show up, we would have to move.\\nAre you kidding me?!\\nWe opted to leave.\\nBut not before informing him that we dine at this restaurant no less than once a week, spending no less than $120 per visit, plus standard 20% tip.  However, due to his brusque, rude, and unwelcoming attitude, we would not return.\\nIf the hostess said we could pull another table over on an empty patio, for good customer service they should have let it ride instead of approaching us, THE CUSTOMER, and telling us to move.  They should train her not to seat people that way again and let it ride until we leave.  I even pointed out to the manager that as a family with children, we would likely not be taking up the table for too too long.  No matter, this young man had made up his mind that he did not want our business.  It is also worth pointing out that when our server came by and told us it was happy hour we told him we want the premium drinks and don't care about the cost.  We were prepared to spend money, just as we always do at every place we visit. \\nI can only assume we were pre-judged as a family with kids.  It is my opinion that this young man showed very poor and hasty judgement and lacks the customer service skills vital for someone in a management position.\\nThis situation was definitely mishandled.  It didn't have to be a big deal and I don't know why it turned into one.  As mentioned there was only one other party (of two) on the patio and it seems bad practice to turn down business.  I am unsure why my family is of less value as customers than the crowd that the manager was expecting, hoping and willing to trade our business for.  How is a group of two occupying a table for four okay but five people cannot utilize readily available and empty space?  5/8 is greater than 2/4.  \\nWe ended up eating  Old Chicago down the street, where they also have outdoor seating.  We had excellent service, and our party increased by two shortly into our visit.  Our bill was $169ish, plus a $30 tip for our server.  Could've been at Chevy's. \\nWe won't be back.

My husband is on the keto diet which lets him have wings and today he was craving wings bad. We made our way down there to try it out. \\n\\nHe got 20 wings hot and I got the chicken fingers medium with curly fries. My husband was excited that they automatically give you bleu cheese with the wings (he's originally from Buffalo, NY.) For my fingers I had to ask for a side of ranch, which I think is an extra cost. My husband loved his wings. He let me try one and I thought the hot had good flavor, not too hot, but left that nice tingling burn on your lips afterward. My medium fingers had good flavor and the curly fries were really good as well. \\n\\nThere is an odd thing though where they don't actually give you the check. When you are done eating you are supposed to go up to the counter to get your amount owed and to pay. It wasn't busy the day we went so it wasn't hard to figure out where we sat, but I am curious how they do it on a busy night. I declined to get a receipt for my payment so I don't know if you actually get to see your bill if you do ask for a receipt. I didn't particularly like that part because I have been in restaurants where an extra something, whether it be a drink or an appetizer that we didn't order or eat has ended up on my bill in error, so I would personally rather have been able to verify what I was being charged for. \\n\\nAnyway we will definitely be back.

Something about the stench of breakfast, lunch and dinner all combined into one smell and people all around you gorging themselves just does not appeal to me, nor is it appetizing in any way. However, I will say that buffets can be convenient and affordable at times which is the only reason I've eaten here...twice.\\n\\nThe first time I dined here was for breakfast and despite my hatred of establishments such as this, it really wasn't too bad. Their fruit was very fresh and plentiful. Most of the classic breakfast items were on the buffet line like eggs, bacon, pancakes and waffles with a few international treats mixed in like crepes filled with a sweet cheese mix of some kind. However, as is usual with massed produced food, the bacon was not crispy, the foods that were supposed to be hot were not and the oatmeal and grits were so thick it was rough trying to get it in a bowl. The omelet station did a good job, but was terribly slow and used too much butter for my liking. \\n\\nLunch was nothing special, but does the trick if you're hungry. The salad portion was all fresh and had quite a bit to choose from with all of the usual items present. The rest of it was a hodge podge of meats, pastas, rice and a few mystery items that I couldn't decipher. Dessert, as is usualy, wasn't bad with chocolate cake and ice cream...by far the best part. \\n\\nService is average, but nothing special seeing as it is a buffet establishment which pretty much means self-serve with the exception of your drinks. Prices are not cheap, but much better than some of the other tourist trap restaurants nearby.

Everything about this ramen was delicious, from the chewy noodles to the soft, tender prices of pork belly on top, and the flavorful broth that just brought it all together. The one thing I would say is that I might just go for the original broth next time.

The store is right on a Main Street and the interior has a square area for singles as well as parties.

Although, they should update the system to tell you how many are ahead of you to make it even better! I came on a Tuesday around 6:45 and waited around 20 minutes. \\n\\nFood: Many ramen options ranging from shio, shoyu, miso, kara miso, and more! They also have some dry ramen options as well. Appetizers here are pretty good as well. As mentioned above, this location has combos which start with a small ramen along with a side such as a gohan (rice bowl), gyozas, or karage (fried chicken). Depending on your option, it will set you back around $15. Adding $1/$2 will upgrade your ramen sizes. They also have the pork cheek as a meat option and is to die for! Nice and fatty pieces. The ramen itself isn't as big as other ramen in the Boston area but is definitely the most consistent in terms of quality.\\n\\nAlways a good spot to come for dinner, but I would anticipate 20-40 minutes wait depending on when you come.

Well this past Saturday, I satisfied my curiosity.\\n\\nOk first off, this is valet only (technically there ARE 3 spots on this little side street, but you'll never get one) & they were prompt & even remembered me by name when I came out.  There is a short walk from the valet area to the front door.  I guess this was somebody's house back in the 40's but is has been remodeled.  It does appear that they kept the hardwood floors.  Since this place is in Buckhead, they are trying as hard as all get out to be eclectic & they do succeed after a fashion.  There are all kinds of garage sale fish ornaments hanging everywhere & the occasional statue/fake Andy Warhol gigantic cameo picture thrown in for good measure.  \\n\\nAlrighty then, where to begin.  This place has Tito's Vodka so when I got my usual screwdriver, the bartender got a great tip.  Actually, the bar, albeit it small, is well stocked & she definitely knows what she is doing.  If only my meal was the same.\\n\\n    I had seared scallops over Hoppin' John (read black eyed peas & white rice, with diced tomatoes).  The scallops were ok & I found the black eyed peas surprisingly good, but the whole thing just was not hitting on all cylinders. I can't really put my finger on it, but it looked better than it tasted.  The waitress said that the head chef was a native of New Orleans & had won on that food show \\"Chopped\\" a couple of years ago.  Color me unimpressed.

Not that she was rude or stuck up, she just kept forgetting to bring stuff that we asked for.  Also, she said she had eaten (& absolutely loved, darling) just about everything on the menu.  Considering that she looked like she weighed about 6 pounds I took this with a (skinny) grain of salt.\\n\\nI just found the whole experience lacking.

Defiantly an Austin original, there is a slick vintage design with a modern twist.

The food was exceptional, best pizza in Austin, and the atmosphere is awesome being right in front of the action at the bar area.

The wait wasn't terrible. We waited maybe 20 minutes for two people. I had the fros√© with the foul play aka chicken and waffles. I am not a fan of the combination, but folk art did it justice with the Sriracha compote. The peaches were tender and not overly sweet or spicy from the Sriracha. The chicken was a split fried breast. It was not greasy or overly breaded. I asked for syrup on the side for my waffle and combo. I saw on the menu they have collard greens Cole slaw. I'll have to come back to try that, it sounds amazing (if you love collards). Service wasn't anything outstanding, but also not over bearing to get you to order or a magically disappearing act. Everything was just right. \\n\\nMy only complaint would be for allergy sufferers, which is a personal issue and not worthy of taking a star away.

Seating was prompt and within the 20 minute time frame that we were quoted! This was very pleasant, as reservations for brunch are not accepted.\\n\\nOur server was lovely. He was busy, and we probably could have benefited from more visits from him but it's brunch on a Sunday in Atlanta - can't expect too much attention.  We shared the sweet potato beignets, fried pickles with a lovely couple (shout out to Charl√© W. and her bf Max!). I ordered the Folk southern fried, which involves fried chicken and biscuits with fried eggs and sausage gravy. I also ordered a Fentimans Ginger Beer. Ok really quickly - that ginger beer was effing delicious. Ginger burned my throat and sh*t. My goodness, I have never had a beverage like this.\\n\\nThe sweet potato beignets were reminiscent of super high class doughnut holes. I've never been to Cafe Du Monde but I feel like the beignet part of this dish could have been more beignet-ed. The flavor profile was something I've never had in a doughnut hole, but that's what it reminded me of. The fried pickles were perfection. Each pickle was fried perfectly. Absolutely delicious.\\n\\nAs far as my brunch entree went - my eggs were cooked PERFECTLY. The server did a quick run down of my egg options, and I chose eggs over medium. The yellow was runny and the white was perfect! This is incredibly difficult to do (in my opinion). The sausage gravy - creamy, extremely flavorful, and the sausage was plentiful and tasted house ground.  The fried chicken was a breast tenderloin and wasn't so juicy. It also needed more salt. Still pretty edible and enjoyable with the gravy.\\n\\nThe biscuit was probably my least favorite part of the meal. It was drenched in butter and toasted - all I tasted was butter. I left most of the biscuit on my plate because the butter was overwhelming. It was also a little too toasty - I think I prefer my biscuit to be fluffier and soft, but from a chef's vantage, I can see how making it toastier and on the crispier side would help balance the potential sogginess from the sausage gravy and egg.\\n\\nAll in all - I would 100% visit again.

Anybody who comes to Stumptown, who happens to love doughnuts and not bound to any dietary restrictions, has an obligation to make a pilgrimage here.

However, like love and the English language, there are exceptions.  This place happens to be one of them.   Whenever my husband and I have visited, we always go early in the morning to avoid the queue of people that can stretch around the block.  No, thank you.  It was worth it to make the bleary-eyed trek to this location on our most recent visit, which happened to be a 10-15 minute walk from our hotel.  \\n\\nAs for the doughnuts themselves, I can only speak for the few that we've gotten from past visits:  Voodoo, Bacon-Maple, Cock and Balls, Memphis Mafia and Portland Cream.  The first two are a must, especially for first-timers.  The third is sheer novelty in name and size--not being cheeky at all when I say that!!  I recall the MM being very sweet and filling, but if you are addicted to peanut butter like some people are addicted to crack, this is the doughnut for you.  The fifth because it looked cute.  (Don't remember the reason, but it was probably good.) Overall, they were tasty in terms of texture and sweetness (sometimes a little *too* sweet), but I am no doughnut connoisseur.  \\n\\nAfter eating one of these beauties, I made sure I paid for it both in the gym and on the pavement.
