Vancouver's first and only place dedicated to Nashville hot chicken. The chicken is good. Moist and nice crispy batter. Prices are high and takes about 10 minutes to get your order. In terms of chicken, it isn't any better than competing chicken places like Juke. But their selling point is the seasoning. Unfortunately this is where it falls short. Having had Nashville hot chicken before, in Tennessee actually, I figured their heat scale was accurate. Nope. Their extra hot (second highest) level is a joke. More akin to a medium or slightly hot at best. For those looking for serious heat, get the \\"side of milk\\" level to get decent heat. Fries are literally presidents choice crinkle cut frozen and thrown in the deep fryer. Spiced with medium chicken spice (basically zero heat but nice flavour). Can't say it's really worth the $4. I would expect fresh cut potatoes at a place like this. Slaw and Mac salad are OK. For $3 each theyre also pricy. Don't let the container fool you. They're only half full.  And they charge you $1 for a serving of their sauce. Seems ridiculous to charge so much for everything else and also make you pay $1 for a tbsp of seasoned mayo. For those of you wanting to try Nashville hot chicken, come here for the chicken only with spice level 1-2 levels higher than you expect. I'd skip the sides."},{"name":"The North End at 4580","address":"4580 Broadway St, Ste D-1","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I love this place. The food is always fresh, healthy and yummy!

The service was rushed but good - the place does not have a good set up for retail sales. I was recommended t-bone which I bought alongside a chicken pot pie and their hot dog. The results at home: (1) the steak was cut unevenly, there was almost a quarter inch of difference from one side to the other. Caused it to cook unevenly and ruined it. I'd expect this dilettante cut from Stop&Shop or something of that nature. (2) The chicken pot pie filling was tasty but the pastry was too thick. While brown and baked on top, underneath the pastry was uncooked and doughy. It made it uneatable. Even baking it again didn't save it. (3) The hot dogs were extremely salty - you couldn't taste anything else. I love salt but it was too much.I gave this place a try, I won't again. I might try out eating there as the place looked inviting (albeit crowded) and maybe the food will be cooked better before I give my final verdict."},{"name":"Accanto","address":"2838 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing.

Highland Kitchen is right up my alley, literally too, I live just down the road. This was exactly my experience with Highland Kitchen. I had heard so much about this place, all I needed was a taste test. I took two of my friends who don't visit Somerville much to HK, and I was hoping that the place would be all that I had heard about. Unique is the apt word alright to describe this restaurant. Their food menu is not very extensive, but when you look for quantity, you miss out on quality. We came in at a good time, around half an hour into when they started serving dinner and got a good seat located just in front of their gigantic wall slate colorfully adorned in bright pastel shades with the daily specials. There is a noticeable dearth of vegetarian options, but I decided to go in for just one entree i.e. the Grilled Vegetable kabobs and oh my, was that a delicious meal!! The grilled button mushrooms, zucchini, summer squash and red peppers seemed to have been marinated in some herbs and were so flavorful like I've never had kabobs anywhere. The orzo salad with kalamata olives and chopped tomatoes were an excellent accompaniment as were the warm pita and the cucumber yogurt sauce. What a perfect meal that was - healthy, check; fulfilling, check check check!!  My friends got the curried goat stew and the papardalle bolognese which they both gave their thumbs up to. Also, the sauteed spinach was so flavorful - all the other times I've had such spinach elsewhere have been disappointing experiences, but HK in particular really makes food delicious. Also, although my entree was quite a large portion, it was healthy and light, resulting in the birth of the desire for dessert inside myself. We got the warm banana bread pudding and I asked if I could get some chocolate on it. Dessert was served. The banana bread pudding was generously doused with chocolate sauce with a nice scoop of vanilla right on top. I'm going to take a moment here to recall and mentally savor the melange of flavors in that bowl. There was the banana of course, very prominently dominating the flavors, then the soft warm bread with a lovely texture that was very similar to caramel custard/creme brulee. The cold vanilla ice cream was a really good accompaniment to the warm pudding. The chocolate sauce somehow accentuated the flavors of the ice cream and the pudding really well. Service is quite fast and friendly enough. Very clean cutlery and crockery, suitable for the germophobes too. In all, a very very delightful find! I'm definitely going back and would recommend this to everyone!!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a nice place to come to if you like good food with great taste and lots of flavor!

I understand that we had a large party (10) so that sometimes makes things a little difficult, but wasn't quite as mind blowing as I expected it to be based on some of the reviews of the first visitors. The owners are ABSOLUTELY fantastic- smiling when you enter the door, checked to ask how we liked the food, and seemed generally interested in my answers.Wish the wait staff was of the same caliber. My beer was forgotten and when I had to ask for it again about 15 minutes later my waitress looked like I had done something wrong. Also, the water is served in small cutsey glass bottles, which are nice, but for the very salty food we were constantly out of water. When we would ask for more (which we always had to ask) she would bring one bottle over to our group of six on one half of the table, so it wouldn't even go around to all of our glasses.The food was definitely interesting and props to them for the creativity with the dishes- we practically had everything on the menu because we had a large group. My favorites were the pork cheek, scallops, french fries.My biggest complaint about the food was that everything was SALTY. We had some inconsistencies with the amount of salt on our food- we had two orders of the scallops and one was very minimally salted and one was practically inedible it was so salty. The pop rocks edamame was delicious but I felt that even that was relatively heavy considering what the dish was.Overall, I had a good time and the food was interesting. The atmosphere is also great- I like the decorations and location. However, at normal prices, ok wait staff, and salty food I'm not sure if I'll become a regular.However, I do have to say props again to the owners- they were so attentive that is the reason why I really did leave the place with an overall positive experience."},{"name":"UFO Pizza","address":"6024 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went in on a lazy Sunday evening for dinner.

They are not shy about spice, and that's awesome in my opinion.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I think it's a little pricey for the cramped space (albeit nicely decorated) and the casual feel.

The Bacon Cheeseburger was juicy and cooked perfectly with nice flavor and toppings on a very soft bun. The shoestring fries and fry sauce are a great accompaniment. The hush puppies were soft with a nice crunch to the outside! They remind me of how my Grandma from Arkansas used to make them.

Not a traditional preparation of trout, but it was an innovative combination of traditional Portuguese ingredients.The desserts were also good. So many times even at fancy restaurants, the desserts are a bit of an afterthought, but here they had interesting, creative desserts that were just as yummy as the food (passionfruit pudding served in a martini glass, for one). Everything we had was SO well executed, and I wanted to try just about everything on the menu. We will be going back!Pleasant, gorgeous restaurant. A little pricier than we prefer -- the bill was $80 for two of us and we shared an entree and ordered wine by the glass instead of the bottle. But I suppose you pay for quality.

It is somewhat of a trek, being more inconveniently located between Davis and Porter Squares than one would think possible. However street parking here has never presented as problematic, other than in the impact it has on my ability to enjoy as many 'periodistas' as I want.We arrived at about 8:00 on a Tuesday night. The hostess was extremely friendly; letting us know that she had several tables just finishing desserts, and that we could expect to be seated within 15 minutes. The bartenders in this place have skills, as witnessed not only in the aforementioned tasty cocktails, but also by the fact that although we immediately took seats a ways off from the bar, on stools by the window, we were still acknowledged by the bartender and handed out a cocktail menu mere moments after arriving. Our table became available so quickly that we didn't have an opportunity to order at the bar.The tables in this place are super close together. So close that at one point we were both having trouble maintaining our own conversation because we were so distracted by the conversation going on less than a foot away from us... As I had told him nothing about the menu ahead of time, my date was definitely surprised, and impressed when he first opened the menu. Ultimately he wound up ordering two different appetizers and a side allowing him a nice sampling, and I ordered an entr√©e off the menu. I enjoyed my pan-roasted chicken, and my date proclaimed his choices to be really good, \\"almost too good to be truly authentic\\".As we were finishing up the hostess came over and asked us if we wanted to participate in the Tuesday night spelling bee, which after asking a few questions we decided could lead to some quirky fun. The set up is exactly what you see in a classic spelling bee, but I will say that if you decide to participate in this event you need to have a strong ego, because the people running the show have a way of poking fun at the participants in a roasty kind of way. Also several people literally got booed after misspelling relatively easy words. A little bit later in the evening my date told me that after I had misspelled a word (a hard one!) and was on my way back to our table that the man at the table next to ours looked at him and commented \\"I bet you thought she was a keeper.\\" Really?

I KNEW i was in for a treat... Or so we thought. Came in around 3 on a Monday for something to hold us over until dinner. Our hostess/waitress/server/bus-girl was on fire. She handled all titles with a smile like a pro without missing a beat. Serving 6 tables! I tip my hat. That girl was on fire! But the love ends there.What's all the hype about?We must've ordered the wrong menu items bcz the food was overpriced trash. (Along with dirty menus) Bayou Tacos: I've never had alligator and was REALLY interested in trying it. The texture is almost like chicken. The flavor was bleh.Gussied up biscuit: The taste was off. We couldn't put our finger on it but it wasn't very good. Something in the gravy was throwing off the taste. The biscuit alone was carbo-licious and I'm told the chicken wasn't bad. It's just the gravy that's off.Collard greens: People who make southern greens knows the secret is vinegar. It can make or break a batch. Southern Kin, however, borderline pickles the greens. I've never tasted so much vinegar before (other than salt and vinegar chips, of course). I don't know what the chef is doing back there but s/he needs to ease up a bit. Cornbread: I was surprised to learn it isn't served complimentary. That's almost unheard of at a southern themed restaurant. Good news is:  It was the only thing we enjoyed with the delicious strawberry jam. Warm. Melt in your mouth goodness. It's a big no from me. You can't gentrify southern food. Southern Kin tries too hard to stand out and only ends up missing the mark. This would have been a 1 star review but when I told the waitress I couldn't eat the greens bcz it had too much vinegar she comped the entire meal. We were hella shocked. I think she may have seen how displeased we were and didn't want our experience there to be totally ruined. That gesture was beyond admirable. If I'm in the area again I may give it a try based on the reviews of yelp friends and her kindness (also that cornbread is seriously good) BUT I'd stick to the popular dishes.

Each time progressively worse than the last. A couple things missing from menu from last time. Now they charge $1 per piece of uneaten food instead of a quarter.

Edammame was good. I tried the hibachi fried rice (got it before and it was nicely browned with crispy crunchy edges) This time it was like steamed brown rice with beef thrown on top. It was not even mixed in the rice. \\nFried banana dessert was HORRIBLE, due to the fact that they are not heating the oil up enough before frying things, which results in oil laden food with oil flavor. \\nAlso the price went up 2 bucks since our first visit about 6 months ago.Sadly, it looks like the writing is on the wall.... will not repeat as the delta between our first time and last is too huge, and we felt that when your paying 85 for dinner and the salmon and tuna are old, its not worth it.

Let me explain.I base my ratings on the way the restaurant should be based on reputation & price.  When I give the dive bar next to my house 5 stars, it isn't because I think it's far superior to Beast.  But for a dive bar, it's damn good!!  And Beast.  Well, for a restaurant that has been awarded Restaurant of the Year by ?The Oregonian, I've been to better.  Far better. Let's start with the food.  It was good.  Very good.  And probably a decent value for the price.  I went with my parents when they were visiting Portland.  They have dined in the finest restaurants, all over the world, and even they felt the food was nicely prepared & presented.Now the atmosphere.  Liked the decor & the open kitchen.  But, really, what's the point of an open kitchen if the chef doesn't interact with her guests?  The service (this is where Beast really loses stars).  We all ordered the wine flights, and the wines were decent, but the service in general left a lot to be desired.  1st, why so snobby?  We're the ones paying the money, and we're not snobby, so why should the waitstaff be?  Here's the clincher, though.  Fruit flies.  Everywhere.  And that wine flight I talked about?  The fruit flies were flying in our glasses & drinking our wine, then passing out in their alcoholic bliss inside the glass.  How unappetizing.  The first couple of times, we would just pick the fruit fly out.  But after a few times, I called the waitress over & pointed out all of the fruit flies floating in my glass.  I was thinking maybe she would bring me a different glass of wine (we're not at the Montage anymore!).  She brought me a spoon!  Yes, a spoon.  So that I would better be able to fish out the multiple fruit flies.  Sweet.  That's amazing service.  Ok, I've done enough ranting.  Just want to also mention that this was a bit over a year ago . . . I've been lazy about writing a review.  Maybe they've cured the mid-summer fruit fly problem, and gotten servers that know what fine dining is like."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"We live in Tampa Bay and get to the Lake Buena Vista area several times a year.  We have patronized Chevys numerous times over the years.  Before Saturday (11/09/2013), the last time we had been there was spring of this year (2013).We could see some workers outside the restaurant doing some landscaping, but we had no idea that the restaurant had been closed for renovations and just reopened.  When we walked in, we couldn't believe the changes.  It was a little dark inside and the layout had been changed.  When we sat down, we noticed the menu had been considerably pared down and we had to read it all to find out what exactly was on it now.  We were pretty taken aback by the prices.  From what we remembered, the prices were about 25% more now than before before, but that is our recollection.I felt a little uneasy, though, because in my experience as a restaurant patron, changes to an existing restaurant, especially the menu generally mean the restaurant is in trouble and trying to cut costs and raise profits.  This uneasy feeling was confirmed when our order came out.The first sign of trouble was when they brought out the chips and salsa (eventually).  We used to get a large basket, but now they come in much smaller baskets.  The salsa was great, as usual, a bright spot in a disastrous experience.  I ordered the Fresh Mex combo for $12 with one taco and one enchilada.  I remember the price being $8.99 previously, but I may be mistaken, it's been a long time.  The last time I had this, the plate was pretty big and the food took up the whole plate.  This time, I thought they gave me my two year old son's kids meal, because the taco was a 1/3 of the size and the enchilada was pretty small also.  The plate was much smaller and there was a lot of empty space on it, probably because the refried beans and rice that I got with it were served in a tiny dish and plate that came alongside the main dish.  We were appalled at all of our portions.  They should be ashamed of the amount of food in the kids meal for what we paid for it.  My son and I were still hungry after eating.When the waitress came over to ask how we were doing, my wife couldn't hold back and told her that we had been to that location numerous times in the past and were extremely disappointed this time.  She said she would let the manager know and he would stop by to talk with us.  When he did, my wife reiterated her comments and he apologized.  He then went on to explain that of the five Chevys that used to be in the area, they were the last one left.  It all made sense now.  Their previous business model did not work, they were in trouble, and they are now desperately trying to cut costs and raise profits.  My uneasy feeling was dead on.Sadly, we will not give this restaurant another chance.  They have received the last $50+ from us they are going to.  Yeah, that was $50+ for lunch for two adults and one child.  I know this is a heavy tourist area, but that is outrageous.  I bet they are counting on unsuspecting tourists paying the money, but we know better now.We are going to go to Qdoba just down the road or find a Chipotle close by from now on.  We feel like we get what we pay for at those places."},{"name":"Haley House Bakery Caf√©","address":"12 Dade St","city":"Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Easily one of my favorite local places.

We end the meal with honey cake and panna cotta for desserts.Overall, it was an interesting experience. However, in term of the food taste---it was too bland. A lot of the ingredient didn't seem to be very cohesive with the dish so it come off as \\"odd\\" I understand they are trying to take a Southern food and put a flair to it, but it just didn't seem to work out.

My wife and I tried it last week and had very mixed thoughts on the experience. \\nPros...\\nThe food is great and Mt.  Dora is a quaint little town that's neat to visit. \\nCons...\\nService was fair to poor. Our server disappeared numerous times not to be seen for long intervals. I don't appreciate having to look for soda refills and take out containers for leftover food. The restaurant only had four other tables so it wasn't like they were packed with people. \\nThe worst issue though was the piano player/singer. He was ungodly loud and literally went from table to table singing at the top of his lungs. Now I have nothing against singers in restaurants. Las Palmas in Sebastian had one when we were there but he wasn't intrusive and did a good job of lending to the Cuban style atmosphere of the restaurant. This guy was just LOUD. I literally couldn't hear my wife across the table talking to me.  \\nIt looks like the Mt. Dora restaurant is trying to sell itself as upscale and trendy as opposed to just having great service and food. Will I go back? Probably. The food is great ( Get the fried plantains and the flan) and I love Cuban food. I can pretty much guarantee though that I'll go on a weekday without a singer  to avoid permanent hearing damage.

The use of cumin and I think a hint of turmeric is genious! My tongue was having a party with every bite I took.  Ok, it wasn't really my order but my BF don't mind.  The polenta ragu is a grazy idea.  Its like lunch and dinner so how does that fit in brunch? should it be in their linner menu? Yes, linner.  No matter, since no one was invented a linner menu, brunch will have to do.  Crazy invention pays off with this great dish of polenta and the hearty ragu.  Perfectly seasoned and well balanced, not too heavy on the portion either.Tasty mary is just as it says.  What's cook, is has sriracha! What the heck is that doing in a Mary? Who ever decided to put that in there, Thank You.  I normally like sriracha on my fried chicken but it doesn't hurt being in my Mary.

First of all the grilled chicken was more like boiled or poached chicken with absolutely no flavor, and it tasted like old chicken. The garlic cream sauce was just okay; I could have made a better one at home.

My partner wanted some coffee and maybe a scone before our 6 AM flight post Austin City Limits Music Festival and this did the trick.All the usual morning suspects. Muffins, croissants, scones, little sandwiches, coffee and water. Everything was fresh enough but nothing really jumped out as special. Especially for the prices we saw displayed nicely or not.Like moved quickly and the staff was awake and friendly for 5/6 in the morning on a Monday. The counters were clean and all the sugar and creamer was easily accessible. I'm sure from the hours of 7-10 likes get long and staff and passengers get irritable but we lucked out.Full and varied menu so it wouldn't be bad to eat here at a later time. Probably something on the company dime though versus your own pocketbook. Cheaper and more filling/casual options right past security. Maybe you're a million miler or on business/vacation and want to feel fancy. Think you'll find something for your date or small party of 2-4 here. If you're flying into AUS you'll probably eat elsewhere upon exiting the airport. Maybe you arrive early and eat here but for the prices and menu fair I'm sure people would just visit their airline's premier customer lounge for a similar experience.

Dishes are served family style, so get ready to share.The biscuits came first and my were they tasty. Rich with a buttery crisp exterior and smothered in a meaty cream sauce. Tasty!! I wish they were bigger. Next were the doughtnuts, soft and warm with a crisp sugar coating. Like a chocolate molten cake. Mmm.The shakshuka and pork were next. It must be a thing there, or rather just because it was breakfast, everything had a gooey warm egg on top. The pork was crisp, served over spinach. The shakshuka was deep, rich, brimming with tomato flavors.The ragu took the longest time to get here. I think it was a fluke our food came so slowly, everybody else's food seemed to come quicker than ours. But boy was it worth the wait. The polenta was rich and still a bit grainy.

However, since this is my neighbourhood and it is one of the only legitimate breakfast options, it gets a bit of a boost for filling a void. I have never, ever had lunch here. Only breakfast or brunch. Even at 2:30 in the afternoon, usually because I've indulged in serious amounts of fun the night before. The place is a quick service, order-at-the-counter restaurant. None of the staff is particularly full of any personality, but they get their job done. I have never had my order messed up, and it comes out quick. The portions are good, and the food tastes like it should. There's nothing fancy here. If you're ordering bacon and eggs, you're getting bacon and eggs. There's no special twist to it, they're not concerned about plating and I almost prefer that when I just want a quick breakfast. Biggest complaint: price. It's a pretty pricey breakfast place. These basic bacon and egg breakfasts, with a small juice on the side will cost you around $13. Not terrible, but you can also find better deals.

Accanto took me by surprise with its superb use of citrus and sweet flavors to make their dishes shine, which I've never really experienced in other Italian restaurants so it was pretty unique. Their fritto misto was well-seasoned and fried, and the variety of ingredients they fried (green olives, lemon, onions, bell pepper, squid, and one more?) got us so excited for our next dish--sort of a 'what are we going to get next if it's already THIS good??). Their formaggio plate was paired well with preserved orange peel and some candies pine nuts--we definitely wanted more of this plate. Our two pasta dishes were our favorite--we wanted more of these too. The lumache, so well cooked to the perfect al dente, flavors so well absorbed into every bite. I could go on and on about the squid ink spaghetti, the mint truly brings out the umami in this dish and I would come back all the time for this dish alone. Their house-made gelato did not disappoint. We got their biscotti cookie dough and their malted chocolate. Only thing we would've asked for here is more cookie dough--but I'm pretty sure we can never have too much of that. Their canoli, again paired with preserved lemon peel and candied pine nuts, was the perfect end to our meal, bringing us full circle with those same citrus/sweet flavors that I honestly didn't think would compliment the entire meal so well. I understand that we all have different palates, so while citrus/sweet might not sound appealing when it comes to Italian food for some--it really elevated the cuisine for me!!

We had to flag someone down to ask after our drinks, and after we did I saw our waiter run to the POS, so I wonder if he had forgotten to put them in in the first place.Problem #4: our drinks came at the same time as our food, ~45 minutes after sitting, which also happened to be much later than all other diners around us who had sat long after us.Problem #5: our waiter didn't make much of an apology for the wait and his inattentiveness, so we had to flag a manager down to help remedy. The manager offered us free biscuits and to purchase us either a round of drinks or dessert, which I appreciated- the biscuits came as the same time of the food and drinks though, so didn't really help alleviate our hunger (plus I personally wasn't impressed with them, they were doughy and not flavorful and crap compared to Sweet Cheeks').Problem #6: we wanted to take up the manager on his offer of purchasing our round of drinks, and told our waiter- who proceeded to bring us another identical round of the same drinks we weren't even halfway through with yet. Uh, not what we had asked for? We had to speak to the manager *again* to remedy, and he ended up taking both rounds off our bill so we were only responsible for our individual entrees.This all left a bad taste in my mouth- poor training/staff/service was their major downfall. Plus, we thought everything was overpriced for what it was- $7 for a side of a few potato wedges, $25-30 for entrees, apps $10+- just not worth it.On the positive side, everyone thought their food tasted pretty good on the whole: ribs seemed solid, fried chicken was decent (although not very memorable), smokey potato wedges were excellent, and some people liked the biscuits. Similarly, my own shrimp and grits had good flavor (although no spice whatsoever) and a large portion, but I was disappointed in the shrimp they used: tiny, shelled/tail-off, slightly overcooked, unseasoned boiled shrimp that was only tasty if you took a bite of the grits and sauce at the same time. Skip- this isn't worth your time or $. Stick to Sweet Cheeks or the Frogmore."},{"name":"La Casita","address":"101 W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This was the best meal I had in Vancouver!

Come to find out, walking inside is like stepping into another world. Not like Nam or Tamarind Seed or even Top Spice, but certainly in stark contrast to the outside. By that I mean you feel like you're in a Thai restaurant, not some bright blue beach-shack looking building with empty construction/parking lots surrounding it.The food surprised me, also. Very good list of traditional That entrees. We went with the Chili-basil chicken, alongside fried wontons as an appetizer.  The rice for the entree came plated in a nice little volcano, while the fried wontons were served in a wine glass as long, sticks of fried wonton. Crazy. I'll see if I can upload my photo after writing this - the presentation deserves to be seen. Ashley was turned off by the chicken, it definitely didn't spend as much time cooking as you'd probably expect from anywhere else. That's probably a bad thing, for most, a bit of tenderness was fine by me. The entrees are served with a VERY delicious egg drop sour/spicy soup. Seriously I want a bowl of it. Anytime I eat anywhere even remotely Asian. that's like 3 stars on its own.You know what throws me off haha!?

My friend found a Groupon so we decided to give it a try - there's a reason it was on Groupon, people. We are a group of 6 college-aged women out for a girls' night out. When we arrived at the restaurant, our first turn off should have been the fact that it was completely empty. We sat down and asked our waitress if we could all do individual checks, since 3 of us were there on business and were planning on using our corporate cards. She was so rude to us and made a huge deal about how it was an inconvenience to her, so we decided to break it up into two separate groups. She told us we could do 1 group of 2 people & use 1 method of payment, & then do another group of 4 people, use the Groupon, & use 2 credit cards. She still seemed very disgruntled, but we felt that would be fine.Then came the food. We ordered the bruschetta (both the regular one & the 'fancy' one to start), and were very disappointed by that. We all felt that the bread tasted like they had bought it from Costco & simply spread olive oil and cold mozzarella on top. Not what we were expecting. Then we ordered our entrees, I ordered the pesto gnocchi, and couldn't even eat half of it. I felt like I was eating pine trees. It definitely wasn't a basily, fresh pesto that I was used to.When we went to pay, our waitress was still disgruntled but did as we asked regarding the credit cards. However, on the bill she was supposed to split down the middle, she charged the same card twice. When we informed our waitress, she snapped, \\"This is why we only use one credit card.\\" We will not be going back there, and will make sure to spread the word that no one should spend even the Groupon amount on this place.

The hot pot is pretty good the broth is flavorful, but when you compare it to places like Shabu Zen in Allston, Q in Chinatown or Happy Lamb in Cambridge it is definitely not as worthwhile. The portions are pretty small compared to other places that specializes in hot pot. And I don't mean the buffet style. Since I do live in the same town, it is convenient but you definitely pay more to fill your belly.

Beautiful scenery, surrounded by great stores . Choice to eat inside or out , we choice to eat outside , which was perfect ! The staff was amazing . Our waiter was Tatiana , and she accommodated us with anything we needed or any questions we had asked her . She was very attentive! Also the wait staff name Matt came to check on things as well , and we sparked up a convo ! Very welcoming place and staff !! The manager Brad was also amazing . He was very active , walking around asking how is everything , sparked up a convo with us as well . Brought me a piece of pie out of my choice , and him as well as some staff sung me happy birthday!!!!!! This will be our go too spot !! It's a hidden gem , that you would wanna keep as your little secret lol BUT you can't , cause you wanna spread the word , and bring this place some amazing business , just like they're bring us amazing food ! We got our check , and I was like \\" that's all \\" lol meaning , the prices are affordable and just right !!! The menu isn't large , which for me is great , cause I don't like having too much to choice from . We went with their big bucket of chicken and biscuits, that came with about 5 different dipping sauces for your chicken , and the biscuits come with lovely jam and butter !!! We also got there collard greens (to die for omg ) and their Mac , which was tasty as well . I had try their sweet tea , and I had to get a refill cause it was so good lol . Please try this place if you're looking for some real southern style food !!!! We will be back !!! Lol  So I had to write another review . This time it's not too great , as far as staff wise , or should I say one in particular staff member . Not sure if her name , don't really care much . BUT she is a hostess or that's what she should be a that being her job title . I first wanna say my waiter Jen and the new Manager was amazing and very attentive . I really appreciate there concern with the issue I was having with the hostess . She was rude and honestly seem like she was over it . We waited to be seated for about 10 mins for NO reason at all . It wasn't packed to the point of having to wait that long . I was with my family and my 8 yr old and my 8yr old asked me why was she so rude in her face . So that got me upset that he could feel her vibe . So I spoke to Jen and Mike . They made us feel comfortable again , which I appreciated . Although I appreciate it I unfortunately won't be eating in , BUT the food is amazing so I will be ordering takeout again lol"},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is definitely one of my more favorite places to relax with some work buddies, we've had a few company functions here!

On the flip side, I didn't really like the fish taco - fish tacos that I have had in the past were usually fried but this one had fish that looks like it came from a can, which was interesting.In all, the tacos were delicious and the decor of La Casita is super quirky with pinatas hanging from the ceiling.

We had 7PM reservations, and by 9PM, the place had all but cleared out - it was down to our table and two others.  Our appetizers and dessert were the best parts of the night.  We started with some Antipasto and some Roman Artichokes ... both were perfect.  So we were off to a great start.  The salads, while simple and uncomplicated, were good.  We each had a different main course though, and neither of us finished our meals.  I was also very disappointed that the chef was unwilling to make a simple substitution - I wanted to swap out one starch for another starch, and yet that simple request could not be accommodated.  If you do go, though, you have to finish the meal with their Chocolate Mousse!  That was fantastic.  One saving grace was our server - she was fantastic and we couldn't say enough good things about her.

Also my friend wanted her chocolate croissant warmed up, and they didn't end up doing that.  However, they were still very tasty.

Phil's is clean and well lit.  Music was upbeat and at a moderate volume and televisions were tuned to sports and iFly.The cashier greeted quickly and in a neutral manner.  I ordered mixed fries and a soda and asked that my burger be cooked medium instead of medium well.  My friend ordered the same.I do not recommend the Maine Root diet soda.  It was flavorless and/or the mix had way too much carbonated water on this particular day.  My friend enjoyed the Maine Root Root Beer.The burgers... oh, the burgers.  They were not awful, but compared to Hopdoddy or even Moonie's Burgers (not the one at Anderson Mill, yuck... but the one up the road @ Park Street in Cedar Park)... or have you tried Liberty Burger in Dallas(?)... we just drew a blank with our Phil's Icehouse burgers.The meat on both burgers was very thin and had not much flavor at all.  Neither burger was cooked medium, but with patties that thin, it's probably hard to cook them other than medium-well or more.  My friend liked the flavor of the egg and bacon on his Jollyville burger (the egg was cooked well, just a bit runny), but otherwise the burger was ordinary, the meat patty was thin and flavorless, and the sourdough toast \\"bun\\" was so hot and soggy on the bottom, it was very hard to eat the burger.My Violet Crown burger was nothing out of the ordinary either.  If I got a jalapeno cheese bun with my burger, I am not sure what the difference between this bun and a plain sourdough bun would be.  I neither saw nor tasted jalapeno, and I was looking forward to a little \\"zing.\\"  Also, I tend to like a sharper, saltier bleu cheese, and my burger had a small mound of muddled-tasting cheese placed in the middle of the burger patty.  My burger patty was also thin (way more bun than meat), pretty tasteless, and cooked through.... not medium.We each ordered the mixed traditional French Fries and Sweet Potato Fries.  Neither order of our fries was particularly hot or crisp.  My friend's fries were lightly salted, but I think someone completely missed the \\"salt step\\" on mine.  Of course, you can add salt at the table, but I prefer my fries hot, crispy and somewhat salty from the get go.  We both liked the Sweet Potato Fries better than the traditional fries.Partway through our meal, a very friendly woman came over, smiled and said \\"hello,\\" and asked us if our meal was alright.  Toward the end of our meal a young man came over and quickly checked on us as well.  He offered to take our trays and as we were getting up to leave, he smiled and thanked us for coming in.  We really appreciated these efforts from Phil's staff.I might try Phil's again because the staff was friendly, it was clean and pleasant, and perhaps we were just there on an \\"off day\\" for the food.  We would both definitely try different burgers though, and I'll just order water.  Their only choice of soda is Maine Root, so if Maine Root is not your thing, don't order a fountain soda.I'd like to give Phil's three stars, but for interesting burger places around Austin, two stars here means \\"Meh.

The theming of the restaurant is really fun, and there is a lot to look at. Pro tip when you order the \\"pods\\". Ask for just the pods and skip the veggie chips. It saves you about $6.50, and the chips were not worth the piece or stomach space. Instead buy the blue dessert looking thing. It's delicious! One of the best Disney desserts I've had. For the entrees we got curry and cheeseburger pods to try both. I enjoyed the flavor of both pods, but they seemed dry. They needed a sauce.

The bartender was very aloof and I spent ten minutes patiently waiting for my last beer. When the bartender finally came over I was told that the bar was closed and I couldn't get a drink. I explained that I had waited for ten minutes patiently and he was very dismissive. He then proceeded to serve other people after close while I stood there waiting. I asked him why he didn't want my business but he was willing to serve others and he became really aggressive, unprofessional, and rude.

I've been eyeing their menu for some time and decided on pad Thai with chicken. I figured that's a staple menu item that's a good gauge of a thai's place food. Unlike others, I had no issues with the carry out process and asked if the pad Thai was gluten free. They said yes so it was a go. Upon arrival my food was ready and piping hot. I took a quick gander of the place and I like how it's an upscale casual Thai restaurant. I feel most Thai joints lean towards the fast casual. Really clean modern and simple aesthetic wise. Once home my food was still very warm and heavy! The portion was huge but then came the disappointments. Barely any sprouts (love lots of sprouts in pad Thai), no peanuts (wtf?! I said gluten free not peanut allergy), and hardly any green onion. The sprout and onion are essential to add a little crunch especially if the noodles are overdone (as they were in this case). The worst part was the appearance and sauce/flavor. It just did not look or taste right. The noodles were a rust color from the sauce with red pepper flakes sprinkled throughout. I'm accustomed to my pad Thai sauce and noodles remaining the color of the noodles (pale/clear) along with red pepper flakes sprinkled in. This is my first time ordering gluten free pad Thai so perhaps they have a different preparation and ingredients? I don't know. The only decent pad Thai in this city seems to be from Nidas in the north market. Also they only give one lime wedge. Had to cut up a lime at home as I needed more lime flavor to mask the weird sauce. Also found it funny they included packets of soy sauce and a fortune cookie when I specified gluten free. I still want to try dining in as their curries sound yummy and the ahi tuna appetizer and salad both look amazing. Just skip as far away as possible from the pad Thai!!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I was up at 8 on a Sunday morning so that I could type this review to the Yelp community this evening.  That is dedication.  Or, I'm just nuts.  I'm not sure that would qualify me for being nuts.  All I know is that it was cold out there and also that I didn't want to wait 2 hours to eat brunch.  You get up early once in a while on a weekend (in the cold) so that you don't have to wait 2 hours for brunch.My friends and I were second in line.  Within minutes of getting there a line formed behind us.  Although we were cold, we were happy knowing we were getting a table on the initial rush.Tasty n Sons has gotten some good write ups over the last 6+ months.  Brought to you by the people behind Toro Bravo (never been, but know I should go), that is probably enough for anyone to give it a try at least once.  If it isn't, it should be.We started out with two Chocolate Potato Doughnuts with cr√®me anglaise which were $1.50 each.  They reminded me of Dunkin Donuts munchkins if Dunkin Donuts munchkins went to Harvard.  Not overly sweet or oily.  Yes, you can have them for dessert, but they are listed first on the menu so we decided to eat them first.  I dare you to eat just one.Everything on the menu looked amazing.  The menu is divided into 2 sections.  Smaller plates and bigger plates.  Being that I was hungry, as I usually am, I had no time for the smaller plates on this outing.  18 choices plus a special certainly didn't make it easy to come to a quick decision.  After our server came back a few times, the decision was finally made.  I ordered the Shashuka which is a red pepper and tomato stew with baked eggs which I added merguez sausage to.  I'll go ahead and say it.  The perfect food for a cold and windy day.  If you enjoy tubed meat, probably best to add the sausage for an extra buck.  I don't know what merguez sausage is (I do now), but sign me up to be president of the fan club.Plenty of accolades for this place.  What more can I say?

First of all, disappointed that they have no dark meat chicken, only chicken breast.  Since my husband doesn't care for that we ordered turkey instead.  I really expected it to have more of a smoked flavor, it really seems like something you could just get at your grocery deli counter.  For the sides we got bbq baked beans and cole slaw.  Baked beans are like they just opened up a can, not bad but nothing special.  Cabbage slaw is ok, also nothing special.  If they sell meat by the 1/2 lb separately why can't you get two different meats with a family meal that has 1 lb of meat?  Rolls are just ok, kind of hard.  Service was slow, we saw two people working and they seemed a little overwhelmed even though it wasn't that busy.  But hey, I got a free ice cream cone.

What impressed me most of was small bites. Everything we ordered was really good! My favorite item was the pork belly buns! They each contained a very thick slice of super flavorful pork belly. The fattiness was complimented by pickles and a delicious sauce. The peppers dish was also delicious and different. Dumplings were well-cooked, maybe a tad oily for me but still good. The Sweet & Spicy wings were very crunchy and seasoned well. Really good. One of the low-point was probably the calamari. It wasn't seasoned very well and just MEH.

Pay close attention to how much you order or order in waves so you dont get sushi swamped. I know from experience. This place fulfills a niche- and that niche is a good place to load up on cheap sushi with friends. The quality is hit or miss, depending on what time of day and day of the week you go. I got takeout on a Saturday night and the salmon skin roll I ordered tasted a bit stale. But the shrimp tempura roll and spicy salmon roll hit the spot. And did I mention they're fast?

Went to check out this new place yesterday. WORST customer service we've ever had! It was busy as we had to wait a few minutes for a table. Order was taken quickly but it went down hill from there. We ordered tea but was given cold water. We told another server but she probably also forgot since it was busy and we went during dinner time (around 7). Okay, no big deal. We didn't expect service to be fast anyways but after 20 mins of waiting and seeing that the table next to us (who came in after us) had their order we were beginning to wonder what was up. Many people were slowly beginning to leave as more tables are finished with their dinner. After 5-10 more minutes of waiting and trying to find a server (are they all just hiding in the back now that the dinner time rush is over? We saw 3 when we sat down), I decided to walk up to the front counter to ask since there wasn't anyone to wave down from my seat. TURNS OUT THEY FORGOT TO PUNCH IN OUR ORDER! Uhh excuse me? Is this how you start a new business? Why was there nobody to come check up on us if we need water or what not? I understand if you're busy but things were slowing down since it's almost 8. When I asked the two girls at the front about my order they started talking to each other in Chinese and I can understand them asking each other where the paper for the order was and then when they find out nothing was punched in, they looked at me. Seeing as I probably understood them, or can read their facial expressions, they just looked at me and waited for what I was going to say. We were hungry and upset and we didn't want to wait any longer so I just told them that I didn't want my order anymore. There was no apology or anything for making us wait or forgetting the order and a part of me wanted to ask them if they knew what customer service even was but I decided there was no point since they didn't intend to forget my order. But still that is no excuse to not check up on your customers or at least stay within view of anyone who might call for you. We ended up going to Sushi Garden near metrotown as we usually go there and the service is always good even when they're busy! I just hope this doesn't happen to anyone else who might be thinking of trying out this new place.Summary of above (to those who don't want to read long reviews):Horrible service. Long wait.

High praise, indeed.  Four of us descended on the restaurant on Friday night around 7.  Having called ahead, we had a reservation in place, but it was not really needed as there were two tables open.  Having said that, I'm sure that by Murphy's Law if we hadn't made the call, they would have been full.Appetizers were fried yucca with sausage and Brazilian patties with chicken (salgadinhos ou frango).  Yucca was tasty, if a bit dry, but with a good dipping sauce, while the patties were little fried dumplings of delicious chicken and some cream sauce.  For dinner, we ordered shrimp bobo, mariscada, plaintain and tofu moqueca (for the vegitarian), and chicken strogonoff.  Everything came out piping hot, happily simmering and bubbling away in black-glazed pottery bowls.  Everything was also delicious, even the strogonoff (which I wouldn't have expected).  Full of flavor, not quite spicy but not quite sweet, and packed with vegetables, fish, and shellfish of all kinds.  For dessert we split the chocolate and the regular flan; the regular flan was a bit tastier.All told, our meal set us back about $80 before tip, and it was well worth every last penny.

Had to wait about an hour to get a lane, but there were two private parties going on so I'm not going to blame the staff for telling me it would be 15-25 minutes to get a lane.Price is relatively cheap, and we had a free shoe rental coupon for checking in on Facebook. $24 for two people to play 2 games with shoe rental. Not bad at all. Beer prices are standard for Boston, about $21 bucks for a pitcher of Sam.The biggest issue I had was the service. We were there from about 3-5:30 overall, and only had interaction with a server once (the second we sat at a table). We wanted to start bowling as soon as we got our lane, and we assumed the server would pop over to our lane since we saw them checking in on everyone else. We were wrong. In the two games we played, we saw a server once, and that was after asking the bus buy to get us one. We waited about 20 more minutes after that, the server came over to our area, looked at us, and just walked away without saying a word to anyone. We eventually had to go to the bar and leave our lane to get our beer, which I think is pretty ridiculous.

After that additional two-hour period was up, we were told the lanes were closed for a private event. That's over four hours of my life wasted on a bowling alley where you can't bowl.I get that lanes have to be closed occasionally for rehab, but the level of incorrect communication provided is off the scale terrible.But kudos on the local brews and friendly barkeeps, who added a second star to this review.

The spicy jambalaya had generous amounts of different meats, the spicy coconut curried goat stew set my mouth on fire, and the pan roasted chicken was hot, juicy, and crisp.Overall Highland Kitchen is a food destination for those not living in the area, and those like me, a trip there would be a pilgrimage for delicious southern eats."},{"name":"Pho Zen","address":"15936 SE Happy Valley Town Ctr Dr","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing fried rice!!

I'd probably come back for some lighter fare. The Cristo was a bit much for me; I wish the monkey bread was half as thick and more moist, not so dried out. Maybe that was a fluke that day. The egg and the cheese were great, perfectly cooked. I'd take half the monkey bread and a small side of potatoes. I cut the monkey bread in half horizontally and still had a nice sized breakfast.

For entrees most people got breakfast food.  The omelettes were delicious, and the potatoes were good - more like roasted potatoes than the gross greasy little bits of potato that some places serve.

The Chicken Katsu was additively thin and crunchy and the white rice helped soak up the curry sauce. This dish captured the essence of Korean food, homemade, warm, filling and a little spicy, as it came with a side of kimchi. Unfortunately, the order of Chap Chae was sub par, as it did not have the flavor or punch as other Chap Chaes in the Portland area.

Facilities are in good repair.  Even when there's a wait for the pool tables or the alleys, there's plenty to do (three bars in the place).  Bartenders are generally friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to give suggestions.  Waitstaff is attentive.  Decor is fun and light level makes anyone look good.  Music is just loud enough that you don't need to shout (that much).THE BAD:  Heavy-handed corporate management approach means you can't get in unless you have a drivers' license.  NOT a state ID, and certainly not an ID that's expired.  Every time I go I feel like I need to bring a passport.  The door security is that tight.  So make sure your whole party has their damn papers.  THE MEDIOCRE:  The food is bar food.  It's not great and not awful.  It's processed American stuff, you know?  Prices are OK.

I would have given a 4.5 star rating. As we walked towards the restaurant, I first thing that caught my eye was this huge \\"wall\\" of wine!! They have a vast array of wine selection from floor to ceiling. We were greeted immediately. Our waitress (shout out to Bridget) was just awesome. She was attentive right from the beginning. She explained to us about one of their ovens called a Josper oven. It's a unique way to cook food with charcoal and ... I think Bridget said Mesquite? The food tasted superb. We were given some bread to start, it came with regular butter and blue cheese compound butter. I've never tasted anything like it. I would go back just for the bread & blue cheese butter alone! I ordered my steak blue rare, however it was slightly over-cooked to a medium. The roasted vegetables were yummy. When roasted in the Josper oven it added a mouthwatering smokey flavour to it. The evening was near perfect. The one downfall ... the piano music playing was way too loud. At one point my dinner companion and I were almost shouting at each other to be able to hear each other.

Also as a forewarning, when it comes to Mexican food, I really don't care if it's authentic or not - I just care if it tastes good! Just an FYI as I know a lot of people place a lot of value on the authenticity so keep that in mind if you read my review.We came here as a group on a Saturday night after being turned away from The Parlour who no longer accepted walk-ins (BOO). Was one of the restaurants in the area that popped up on the Yelp app with a high rating and we all love Mexican.The place itself is nicely decorated with a nice bright feel to it, but a bit small. We had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes before being seated because all the tables were taken. I counted and it seems that you could fit ~25 people inside (not counting the patio). We ordered drinks  and small nachos to start and share before we proceeded to order rolled tacos, some taco looking non-taco thing and 2 burritos. Drinks - the server himself was nice, but the drinks didn't come until 15 minutes. He said that the bartender had gone out on a break or something - it wasn't very clear what happened. I don't mind waiting anyway, so this wasn't a big deal to me. However, I was disappointed that the drink I ordered had tequila in it, when it was supposed to be vodka. I didn't say anything since I had already taken a big sip.Nachos - good enough I guess. We had a long conversation about wanting the sour cream on the side, but when it came, it still came with sour cream on it. The server said that it was the kitchen's error and asked us if we wanted them to re-make it. We said it wasn't a big deal and ate it anyway but I felt that if they knew already before delivering it, they should have just remade it on their own, instead of putting us in an awkward spot where we'd have to decide to send food back and make them re-do it (which always feels awful to me). Nachos itself was just ok - something's off with their chips, it tasted stale to me? Perhaps even a bit overly salted.Ok now comes to the main stuff - I had the burrito and did not like it that much. Actually, I wanted it with shredded beef, but was surprised to hear that they can't do it because the shredded beef is only offered on specific items because those specific items are pre-made. ICK. I hate hearing the word pre-made. So I decided to go with the Carnitas, shredded soft pork. The meat itself is pretty good, but the overall burrito was kind of disappointing. All it had in there was beans, meat and some cold cheese. And it was dry for some reason. Where are all the fresh veggies or rice? Other things I didn't like were the guacamole and hours of operation - is guacamole supposed to be watery? I have no idea. But what I do know is that I don't like watery guacamole! Hours of operation - they close at 9 30pm on a Saturday. That was a bit of a buzzkill - we ended up being the only ones in the restaurant towards the last half hour and it was suuuuuch a boring atmosphere. My friends seemed content with their choices and the rolled tacos seemed to be a good hit. However, I don't think I'll come back - I think trek back to La Casita."},{"name":"Cinco Mexican Cantina","address":"2851 Akers Mill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Usually they have decent service & GREAT food!

The staff is very attentive and always asked us if we needed something. The waitress was very attentive and helpful. What I love about Mexican restaurants is that they always give you chips & salsa. The chips were crispy and very good. The salsa was okay, a little too americanized for my taste but I understand because of their clientele. I prefer a spicier salda verde. Later in they offered us two other salsas. We also ordered chori-queso. Which is chorizo in a warm queso mixture. I've only had queso one previous time and this one was a lot better; a bit on the salty side.   I ordered the flautas and even though the tortilla was nice and crispy the meat honestly had no flavored. I added guacamole, sour cream and salsa and it was still very bland and dry. Kind of dissapointing honestly.    My husbands steak had very good flavor but it was a bit tough. The quesadilla was good and the rice and refried beans were also good.    The star of the evening was definitely the fried cheesecake. In my opinion it would had gone perfectly with some ice cream. The other desserts also looked amazing.

The orange/fennel/mixed greens salad was balanced and not overly dressed. The space is small but sleek. Wines by the glass are interesting and rotate frequently it seems.The average: the tagliatelle was what you'd expect a steakhouse pasta to be: a decent effort but one that makes you say \\"should've just gotten two steaks.\\" The charcuterie plate was a bit on the lean side, but it's Dine Out. Desserts were a bit too sweet and would be a pass if not part of the deal. The wine list is on the pricier side and leans away from steakhouse labels and toward more esoteric varietals and regions. A bit more well priced and this would move to the good category. I settled on a bottle of Rose Champagne that was about 2.5x retail.  The bad: service was Dine Out week level.

This happened to be my least favorite part of the dish. the flavor of the ricotta did not mix well with the crab and lobster flavors. The salmon however was perfectly cooked with the skin on which provided a lovely crisp. It was over a bed of saffron risotto. The entire dish was covered in a tangy tomato sauce.

I even had an entire meal comped once because of a friend who was a very picky eater. The kitchen could not prepare something that she wanted, so it's free? She did order, did eat, and did enjoy it. I've been here with a party of two and a huge group of ten, and it's always awesome. I'll be coming back again. I do want to note that the radicchio salad at Tasty on Alder is the better salad between the two restaurants ;) that one comes with a chopped 6 minute egg and bacon lardons that are amazingly mixed into the parmesan dressing.

The Pear was also delicious, but by the time I finished the Olive Oil, my mouth was either too numb or the richness had become too much.

Not exaggerating this at all.  there's a lot we can tolerate from eating in the area we live in, but time after time you deal with people in customer service who ruin the reputation of the business, this is no exception.it's unfortunate that a restaurant with a  good location, good food & drinks, and good atmosphere gets wrecked by bad hires.owners of businesses: take a note from people writing reviews, these aren't rants by idiots with nothing better to do with their time.  these are the opinions of people who will make or break your business that you've invested hard earned money into.  standing by your staff is good for morale, but it is also path that walking down can lead to more and more people NOT wanting to spend their hard earned cash paying the salary of incompetent employees.would I come back?  if the staff changed and received decent training I might consider it.  good luck guys!  you're going to need it."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There's always a line but come on, this is Portland.

It's the best Italian spot in Boston without even a question. The North End, in it's entirety, should kneel at the feet of whomever runs this fabulous establishment and falate him for his greatness, because they're all bitches to this pimp of the kitchen. In terms of Italian food, the food tastes like it was cooked by the culinary hand of God himself. I can't explain it better than that.I've had half the stuff on the menu there. Everything is awesome. But nothings fussy. Everything's like five ingredients, max. but everything is fresher than all get out. They respect the food, and they respect the flavors, and the heritage of what they do. This is a proud family doing fantastic food the way it should be done. It does things to your soul. You can taste the love they put into it.  Everything is home made, including the pasta. You will NEVER, EVER get a single piece of pasta that is overcooked- perfect al dente, EVERY time. You'll never get an off flavored clam, an overly rare meatball, a spot of cheese on your rigatoni that isn't perfectly melted, slightly brown, but never burnt. They churn out plate after plate of absolutely perfect, simple, Italian food, time and time again. it's a casual joint- come as you are. But you can tell, these people know they're absolutely boss at what they do, but they have no pretense about it. the food speaks for itself, and it is simply the best Italian in Boston. Every dish exits the kitchen dead on perfect. If Gordon Ramsay worked there, he'd be fucking silent- That level of perfect.Don't let the tunnel scare you. make the trek to Eastie and partake in this religious food experience. These people take pride in making some spectacular authentic Italian food, and that pride, and those fresh ingredients, and that love...that family bond, is immediately evident after the first bite of any given dish on their menu. It's nothing short of superb. And it's cheap. My girlfriend and I ate 3 courses with booze for $51 bucks not including tip. You'll NEVER find food that good for that cheap anywhere. Make this a destination. if you're a religious foodie, this is your fucking Mecca. Church, preach, tabernacle. Take your ass to the promised land, and I'll show you heaven. Since Zimmern and Bourdain have made their cameos, the chances of getting a walk in table are about the same of winning the Powerball. Reservations at this point are an absolute necessity since their press blew up, but they don't cop a hint of 'tude despite this.

I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a classic veggie sandwich: only a veggie reuben and a grilled pimento cheese, which aren't exactly diet friendly. I opted for three of their side salads and was pleased as punch. The broccoli salad is by far the best of the best, and I will crave it on the regular. Big fresh broccoli, a light dressing, red onions, sunflower seeds, craisins... yum. The corn/black bean salad was a little heavy on the cheese, but still tasty.

Plus, subs always come with a pickle, which I looove.\\nFirehouse also has a selection of hot sauces and barbecue sauces that are also definitely worth trying.  The store itself has a cool fire engine house atmosphere, and is always clean and neat.

We found out they didn't fry the chicken the traditional way they use air frying I believe it's called where air basically makes the nice crispy skin with way less oil! Healthier fried chicken who knew! But she said it was great. We also ordered the devilish eggs which were ridiculously good! The trout rue and all the fixins so good! They were under the small plates so it was only three but well worth it as a appetizer we could've gotten another one added to make 4 but 3 was good.

The crust is fairly firm while still falling apart easily, and was the highlight of the pie for sure. The group agreed that we could eat just the crust alone. Even cold or heated up, it was great. It's fairly pricey at $20 for a medium pie, but the quality of ingredients used makes it worth it.

You head inside and order in the check out line, pay, then you get a number and wait for your order. There is also a \\"to-go\\" window on the patio.  Our order for ribs came out in an impressive couple of minutes, the tacos came out about ten minutes later. The 1/2 rack of ribs with two sides is a really ample meal. The ribs are served on a whimsical wooden pig-shaped cutting board. Great ribs!!! The side of fennel apple slaw is crunchy, tart, and so refreshing. The grilled veggies are good, I liked the brussel sprouts in the mix. The three tacos I ordered were great for a less hearty meal, still filling-but not as heavy duty as ribs. I LOVE the butter chicken taco. I also asked for the chimmichuri sauce and that was super on the tacos. Felt \\"eh\\" on the pork belly taco. It was good but not to into pork belly. Also found this taco's citrusy sauce a little too sweet for my liking. My husband liked it. The beer, cider, and desserts are served in mason jars, which is fun. We tried the Black and Tan dessert which is like a brownie and chocolate chip cookie combo. Interesting, very sweet and rich, so it's good to share for a bite or two. The service after getting food was sort of hit or miss, they were really busy and hustling to get orders out. I was unsure if we needed to go inside to ask for more  drinks and refills, or if the servers should have offered. Still not sure so I stepped inside to ask for a refill.

They have outdoor seating and an upper level too though sitting by the kitchen downstairs is kinda fun - especially on a rainy day when you are inside eating while everyone outside is running for shelter :) A good meal thats not too heavy on the wallet."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I love Turkey!

I've also tried the steak salad, which sounded really interesting on the menu, with kimchi, rice ball \\"croutons\\" and an asian-inspired tangy vinaigrette. The steak came out lukewarm on my salad even though the restaurant was empty at 2 p.m., the lettuce was dressed really heavily so that it wilted, the steak was really tough to chew, and overall the dish was pretty disappointing.

I won a free dinner for two here during Austin restaurant week.With that being said, I thought this was a very nice place to go for a good dinner. I like the fact that they offer the option of ordering a half a glass of wine which is exactly what my husband and I did. For appetizers we chose the ahi tuna and the smoked ostrich wrapped around buffalo mozzarella. The tuna was good but the ostrich was fabulous. For our main course we both got the strip steak served with a sauteed mushroom and caramelized onion sauce and little round purple potatoes. The flavor of the steak was AMAZING and the portion size was big. Much larger than I expected. For dessert I got the apple crisp and my husband tried the black pepper pana cotta with pomegranate gelee. My apple crisp was fine but nothing spectacular. We both felt that the pana cotta was a little heavy on the black pepper which had all sunk to the bottom so you got a really heavy dose of it when you got to the bottom of the dish. I would like to go back here to try their small plates but I was glad our meals were free because I felt it would have been pretty pricey otherwise.Oh, and there was a great jazz trio playing just outside the door the night we were there.

When I go to a lounge or a club, I'm there to listen to the music.  When I go to an eatery like The Butcher Shop, I go to eat.  The music seriously detracted from the food.

Unfortunately, this most recent visit was not one of them, and it begs the question, \\"Do I have to go to Chicago for a great Uno experience again?\\"  We visited Uno at Crossroads in Lake Buena Vista on Superbowl Sunday night and, fortunately, it was not crazy busy. We were seated right away. I couldn't wait to order Uno's Spinoccoli pizza.  It's my favorite and I haven't had it in years because we haven't been able to find a decent Uno.  I noticed a sign that said that side salads were half-price if you ordered an entree, so we ordered two small Caesar salads along with the regular-sized deep dish Spinoccoli pizza built for 2-3 people.  The Caesar salads were delicious, but it was kind of odd that there was a dollop of dressing that I had to mix in myself to cover everything.  Usually Caesar salads come pre-mixed.  The pizza arrived pretty quick (we were only about halfway through our salads), which first made me a bit suspicious.  Usually because they're so deep, they take 20-30 minutes to cook.  After biting into the pizza, we realized that this deep dish pizza was very average and not up-to-par with Uno standards and my years of previous experience with them.  The dough wasn't buttery and flaky, which made the Chicago deep dish pizzas special.  The crust itself was worthy of eating by itself.  Not so with the \\"new\\" style.  It was basically just plain, dry pizza dough shoved into a deep dish pan.  To make matters worse, the check came and we were charged full price ($4.99 each) for the two salads.  Apparently, pizza for 2-3 people (the equivalent of two \\"entrees\\") isn't considered an entree?   Whatever.  What the hell has happened to Uno to make it spiral downward in quality and pizza standards?

I live on the cape so regular dining here would be difficult, which is a good thing, because it would be my \\"go to \\" place and I would be fat!  I have eaten here 3 times and loved every bite! I keep bringing new people to try it, which may be a bad thing for the wait but oh well, share the wealth.\\n   The only bad thing is the wait, but so well worth it. It's not a place I would bring a small child to because of that, but for adults an hour wait is not a problem. But let's talk about the food.....\\n    I , myself, have only ordered the veal parm. THE BEST I HAVE EVER TASTED, and I am Italian 2nd generation. I have tried other people entrees and love them too but the veal is near and dear to my heart. The veal is so tender you probably could cut it with just your fork. It is crisp and smothered at the same time. Their sauce is so nice , sweet and savory I could drink it. Just writing this , I'm planning when I an go up and get more. As in other's review the portion are large, but all the better in my book. Leftovers are great too. The appetizers I have tried, bruschetta, calamari, asparagus with prosciutto all good. The eggplant parm was so big my daughter (22) took it home and ate to for days. I can't say enough great things about their food! Plus good prices too.\\n  Yes, the restaurant is tiny, yes there is a wait, and yes the bathroom is thru the kitchen. Any one who is from this area remember this common, especially in the north end. All n all , it doesn't  and won't change my mind. Italian food= Reno's.

I love meat and bread.  I would likely drop about $50 a week at this place because of its location.We went over the night they opened and I picked up an almond croissant to go.  It was really pretty good.  Light, flaky, sweet... perhaps a bit heavy on the almond extract, but all in all, a well composed pastry.  *That's* what the star is for.So, tonight, the husband and I wanted to grab a quick dinner and we thought \\"hey, let's head over to Easy Tiger because we've love to try the food.\\"We walk over and the sign says 'seat yourself.'  We find an empty section of a table and sit down. and wait. and wait. and wait.  Staff see us, but no one wants to make eye contact.  I may not look like a hipster, but I don't look like a homeless person either.  Servers intentionally ignore us at the table because I don't think anyone wanted to take the section on.People around us also wander in, sit down, and have staff give them menus and allow them to order.I get you were busy, but the staff was either the rude beyond belief, or so unorganized they have no idea who is responsible for which tables and aren't going to cover anything beyond their bare minimum.I would have flagged down a waitress if anyone would have gotten within 10 feet of me without their back turned towards me.After 15 minutes of absolutely ZERO service and several people around me actually being able to order who arrived after us, we walked out. I suppose it is fitting that we were totally ignored while we did that as well.  In some ways, that is troublesome because I probably would not have been noticed if I had stiffed a giant bill either.I know you guys are still working out the kinks, but I found it completely unacceptable.I may head back over eventually, but its not going to be for a LONG while.  I'll spend my cash other places that actually acknowledge me and allow me to order.And I did do the math... $50 bucks a week at a place convenient to my house is about $2600 a year... in reality, I probably wouldn't be there every week, but I'm deadly serious when I say I would easily have spent at least $2000 annually if it was a place I actually wanted to go, had good food, and felt welcomed.The nice thing about living in a city is there are plenty of other restaurants that are willing to at least hand me a menu."},{"name":"Nemesis Coffee","address":"302 W Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Nice atmosphere.

He was extra cool, laid back, but also very knowledgeable and helpful, about the different share dishes we would get for the table, specifically in helping us gage portion sizes. The items I had a chance to taste included: Original Fried Chicken, BBQ Pork Ribs, Cider Brined Pork Chop, Flat Iron Steak, Low Country Meat and Cheese Board, East Caroline Cheese Biscuit, Tynan's Mac & Cheese. My favorites were the fried chicken, pork chop and Mac & Cheese. The Mac and Cheese took a moment to grow on me, but once they cooled down the greatness of the cheese and flavor thickness took over and made me adore these mac & cheese. The chicken was hot and cooked on the spot, which was beautiful mix that with the right amount of spices without making it spicy put it in a whole new game of greatness. The pork chop flavor was delicious, it was juicy and thick. I would definitely eat at this location again.For my cocktail, I went with a Kentucky Mule which included bourbon. lemon. ginger beer.

(Wish I got a name or picture of the two females) They were slow, and the espresso machine wasn't even working for a coffee shop but that's not the issue. Upon ordering doughnuts, I requested them to be put in a box. She was such a snob about it because apparently at this location the small boxes are meant for 4 doughnuts. What a joke because at the other location and even previously at this location they were more than happy to offer a box. I mean, if I'm buying them for people, I don't want a paper bag and it was just inconvenient to travel with that. She tried to argue with me for a good 3 minutes, and I even offered to pay twice for that stupid box. At the end she basically stated that she was doing me a favour by putting it into a box. Then the other employee that was actually boxing the food items, was even more of a snob. She tried to argue after the first employee about giving a box for two doughnuts. That was when I offered $10 and placed it on the counter. That should be enough for 4 doughnuts that I didn't even want. She had nothing to say but stated that she was doing me a favour as well. Service was slow, staff were snobby and rude. I guess I can do them a favour and never return to this location. The West 4th location is a lot better anyways.

So I really had no idea what to expect from here. When we walked in, we were a bit confused as to what the exact layout of the place was suppose to be like since they just renovated and took over the bar that used to be there. While they still had their \\"shop stand\\" in their original location, it extended into the dining area. So you're not quite sure if you're suppose to sit down and order or go up to the counter and DIY. Their counter doesn't really \\"fit well\\" into what is now their new restaurant. Though I guess they're probably still completing the transition process. But I do have to say that I love the colors they've picked out and how they ended up decorating the place. It certainly provided a nice homey comfy feel of a Spanish cottage. While standing around trying to figure out if we're suppose to order at the counter or not, the lovely gentleman directed us to \\"sit down and relax\\" and he'll come take our order. He seemed very friendly and extremely funny guy. He was kind of nervous and self-conscious of what he was doing. Like he kept apologizing and joking around like, yeh I'm not a waiter. I hope I'm doing this right. So with a little entertainment and friendly conversation came our lunch. We both ended up getting the \\"Special Plate\\" with pork. This consisted of rice, beans, pico de gallo, and corn tortillas. All for $6.50 a plate! There was such an abundance of food, I thought I was going to burst! In addition, I had also ordered their beef tamale, but they ran out of the beef and so I got the chicken instead. Oh the chicken was so tender and delicious, it just melted in your mouth. As for the Special Plate, while it was a lot of food, which most of it I polished, I've had better Mexican food.

The draw is certainly for the game playing and the novelty of the place itself.  We went there on Saturday for a company party that included  dinner and a murder mystery theater.  Also, as part of the deal, his company gave the employees game cards to play after the dinner.  We got there early to watch football on some of the worst TV's we have seen in a \\"Sports Bar\\"  it is certainly time to upgrade.  The service at the bar was decent, there were not many customers to speak of for the one bartender on duty.  We ordered chips and cheese dip which was mediocre at best.  The dinner theater started around 7:45 and there were to be three acts.  The meal was served in between each act.  I have never been to a dinner theater before so I have nothing to compare this too, but if they are all like this one, it will not be something I do again anytime soon.  The acts were long, the storyline was boring and I still don't know who the murderer was or the motive.  We could barely pay attention to the storyline in order to come up with an educated guess for the answer at the end.  The food they served was not very good either.  The thing about big, sit down dinners is that the food is never hot and always bland.  That pretty much sums it up.  When it was over, we left and plan to use our cards another time, which means we will go back to play the games and have some beer...pretty hard to mess that up."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Ate here after searching for advice on area restaurants on yelp.

I have always loved their broccoli cheddar soup and from what I could remember they had pretty good sandwiches too.  I ordered the turkey, cheddar and apple sandwich and upon asking the cashier what else came on it instead of answering she just pointed to the computer screen in front of me.  I saw that \\"sauce combo\\" was a listed item, I then asked her what exactly the sauce combo was since I don't eat mayo.  She said she didn't know but it was \\"kinda their signature sauce\\"  Ummm, okay then shouldn't you know what it is?  When she asked another cashier she said it was \\"some kind of mayo/mustard mix\\".  Probably good to know that, I know a lot of people who can't eat mayo.  Then I saw an \\"apple coleslaw\\" on the list, when I asked what exactly that was the cashiers annoyance was visible (even though they were not busy and there was no one else in line behind me).  She said that it was an \\"apple coleslaw\\" I said yes it says that but what else is in it besides apples?  She said \\"oh you know like regular coleslaw\\"  I said you mean with cabbage?  She said \\"yeah I guess\\".  Now I am annoyed that she seemed not only to not know what was in the sandwiches they sell but not willing to find out either.  I said I didn't want it had to ask for an apple instead of chips when I'm pretty sure they always offered you a choice and paid.  I was shocked that the sandwich came out to over $10!!!  When I got back to my office starving and ready to enjoy my (in my opinion overly priced) sandwich I unwrap it to find cold VERY soggy bread that looked and felt like it had just been taken out of the fridge after days! It was so soggy that it stuck to the paper it was wrapped in and mostly fell apart.  What little arugula there was, was limp and didn't look very fresh and there was NO apple in the \\"turkey, cheddar, apple\\" sandwich.  I wish I would have known that what ever the \\"apple coleslaw\\" was was the only apple on the sandwich.  I reluctantly ate it now being too hungry to get something else, too far away to take it back and too mad at myself for spending close to $11 for the soggy sad sandwich in front of me.

I would have given jester king 5 stars if we didn't have such a horrible encounter after the tour with one of the bar tenders indoors. The woman was immediately unwelcoming and off putting. She seemed immediately annoyed with our presence and only got more unpleasant as we explained that it was my friends 21st and asked for some beer recommendations. She didn't say happy birthday. I don't think she smiled once and may not even be capable of smiling. She basically told us that if we didn't know what we wanted to get out of the way or go to the back of the line. If you are incapable of tending to all different types of people, making people feel comfortable, and providing quality customer experience - WHY are you a bartender? People come from far away to have a cool experience at this place so they should have top of the line service to top it all off am I right? She slapped our beers down at us and ignored me when I said thank you. We even tipped regardless. We walked out and the encounter made my friend obviously upset and I guess another guy working there overheard us trying to calm her down, and he says hey who was it? And when we described the girl he was like yeah I thought so, she sucks. So obviously she has a track record of sucking.

It's just a huge difference in feel and lighting, I don't know why they don't integrate them better.  Had a delicious scorpion bowl.  The truffle mac and cheese was as good as some of the top steak houses in Boston and the caprese salad had great quality flavorful mozzarella.  My boyfriend got fried rice that I picked at and it was flavorful and not overly salty.  Huge portions but it was great to take home leftovers.  Service was spotty, had to wait a while to even catch sight of the server, then call across the room for her as she never checked in.  I found it odd that after dinner I asked a question about one of the cocktails and she answered then just got the check, like she didn't get it that I wanted another drink.   So had that cocktail at the bar instead.  We also ended up stopping by the bar before last call and one of the bartenders remembered us and was very personable.  I saw who must be the owner in sight and he was very attentive, even checking in with dinners.Unfortunately the most recent time I went it was disappointing.  We ordered the same as last time plus the crab cakes.  Everything was tasteless.  The tomatoes had more flavor than the mozzarella, and it tasted as though the mac and cheese no longer has truffle oil in it.  Crab cakes were deep fried and dry with some sort of salad dressing that I tried to moisten it with but gave up on.  The fried rice tasted plain.  I really was hoping for the same amazing food, and may try it once again as the first time was just that great.

We were checked on a few times and given attentive and quick service. The burgers were really yummy, and they had a high-quality beef taste. I liked the bun the burger was served with and the fries were perfectly crisp on the outside, yet soft on the inside. I also had a house margarita and I thought it was moderately priced and hit the spot. I was also eying the food from the couple sitting next to us and it smelled and looked delicious.

I haven't had one of these since I was a kid, so I was really excited to have one. However, this brownie was too dark and bitter for my taste. Otherwise, this was a nice local joint and I'll definitely come back someday."},{"name":"Arms Reach Bistro","address":"4390 Gallant Avenue, Unit 107C","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My fianc√©e and I enjoyed dinner here.  The service was excellent and food was pretty good.  We enjoyed the beef carpaccio (you won't like it if you don't like cheese on it), the gumbo soup was flavorful but was a bit more soupy than I like for my gumbo (they did call it soup).  My fianc√©e's beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and tender.  My salmon was a bit bland and dry.  The risotto that came with the salmon by itself was pretty good but the salmon that sits on top of the risotto didn't quite mesh with the risotto's flavor.  Overall, this is a nice place to eat if you're in Deep Cove.  I would recommend making reservations as the place was pretty packed for dinner despite it being the middle of the week."},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I first went to Truluck's in Miami to celebrate getting engaged (awww) and simply because I love seafood.

First, the place is really loud so you have to shout to have a conversation with your neighbor.  Second, they only have one bathroom for the women and one for the men. Well, apparently assholes like to come here because a woman was in the bathroom texting and we thought there may have been something seriously wrong with her. It's kind of like are you so self centered that you have that little disregard for others? Third, they dont split checks here and they refuse.

But for our party, those who ordered steaks and chops found that most of them were overcooked. This was after waiting an extraordinary amount of time for the meals to come out. I am guessing that this may have been due to trying to time the plates to come out together for our party of 8. But for the expensive prices we were paying, this was not acceptable. Two dishes had to be sent back and then it took another 20 minutes to return. The ribsteak came out for the second time cooked perfectly but they ran out of lamb chops and another cut was subsituted that was tough and not particularly flavorful. Another in our party had ordered potatoes and this was forgotten so he had to wait another 15 min or so for it to come out while his meat was getting cold. When they did come out, the potatoes were underseasoned and not completely cooked. We ordered all 3 of the desserts and the chocolate mousse and apple tart were delicious but the lemon raspberry cake was dry as a bone. It was supposed to have lemon curd but it was hardly noticeable and the buttercream was hard and brittle. I ordered a capuccino and while it was nicely foamed and tasty enough, it arrived in a cup barely larger than a demitasse.The wait staff were all very nice and attentive but the kitchen greatly disappointed. They nicely comp'd the lamb dish but I would have expected no less given the inferior substitution. In fact, I was suprised that the desserts were not comp'd as well given the long delay of our meal and general poor preparation of the meat dishes. For our party of 8, the meal was over $400 with only one beer ordered and not including the tip. For this kind of money, I expect much better. Prices for all items seemed exorbitant. I do not recommend this place."},{"name":"iPho Noodle House","address":"3005 West Lake Mary Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"Quite a good little place out in lake Mary.

There was a good variety in the selections for the evening.  Portions were generous and quality ingredients.  I loved the atmosphere and the rest of my group was not into an overally dressy dinner so this fit well.  Business casual. The only small downside of the meal was that our waiter obviously was not educated on the menu.  I was upfront with an allergy when ordering and he said there would be no problem.

This past weekend, our city-dwelling friends offered up free babysitting, so we immediately made a reservation at the Seaport location. \\nWhen we arrived for our 5:30 reservation, the place was just starting to pick up for the dinner rush. We were happy to see that it is very kid friendly, as there was an entire space filled with strollers, but even happier to be on a date sans child! \\nThe space is really cool and inviting with a large bar and some high-top tables. They serve water as soon as you sit down, and I really appreciate not having to ask for it. I usually order a cocktail I'm not much of a whiskey/bourbon drinker and the drinks were mostly made with one or the other, so I settled on a cider. I would love to see some more vodka options. My husband ordered a beer and we immediately placed an order of the bar wings. They were perfectly smoked and fall-off-the bone, with crispy skin and a mouth-watering sweet agave that finished with a slow heat of the pit spices. They were out of this world. \\nFor our meal we ordered the pit boss, which is three meats and three sides as well as the fried chicken with two sides knowing we'd share everything and likely have leftovers. Here's our breakdown:\\nMEAT - Brisket: amazing. great bark and melt in your mouth without being too fatty. Burnt Ends: my first time having them and they didn't disappoint - big chunks that were chewy and had really great flavor Pulled Pork: good flavor, but a little bit dry. It definitely needed some sauce. Fried Chicken: great crunchy and flavorful skin and really juicy chicken on the inside. The honey hot sauce on the side was nothing to write home about.\\nSIDES - Cornbread: it was fine, we felt like it was missing something, although we couldn't put our finger on what it was. Didn't taste the advertised honey sea salt butter glaze. Sweet & Spicy Coleslaw: this was really good but didn't get any spice from it. It was mostly sweet & vinegary. Pimento Mac & Cheese: a little on the dry side and not very temperature hot, but it had good flavor. Brussels Sprouts: delicious. Would have loved if they were a bit crispier. Sweet Potato Mash: awesome flavor; silky and smooth and not overly sweet.\\nOverall, the meat was better than the sides, and the portions were smaller than we expected them to be. But, we still had a bit of meat left to take home and were extremely full when we left. The food was good, and the service was excellent. Was it the best BBQ I've had? No. There are BBQ places in Boston I like better but I'd still return.

Unfortunately for me, that means celebrating with the Valentine's Day crowd, as I was almost a Valentine's baby.

I don't generally like eating late, but this wasn't too bad.  We were promptly greeted by a very friendly gentleman, who may have been the owner, who said that they were running a few minutes behind, but we could sit at the bar and have a drink if we'd like.  We did and had a drink.  And then we waited, and waited and waited for our table.  We didn't opt to have another drink at the bar because I was hungry and another drink would have been a very bad idea.  We weren't shown to our table until after 8:30 p.m.  I was frustrated and starving.  We had a wonderful and friendly waitress whose name I didn't catch.  We opted for their bruschetta and just salad before our meals because, as I said, I can't really eat too late.  A multi-course meal just was no longer an option.  Our salad plates were cleared and we waited quite a while for our entrees to arrive.  At this point I sent a text to our sitter and said it was unlikely we'd be home by 10, as I thought we'd be.  I sent that text at 9:25 and our meals didn't arrive until 9:40.  My husband got the Osso Buco and I got the mushroom ravioli and we were pleased with the food, but we inhaled it because we were hungry and tired.  I never finish meals in restaurants, but the portion size was ok and the food was delicious.  At this point it was approaching 10 p.m. and as much as I wanted to treat myself to dessert and had been looking forward to a nice dessert, I couldn't do it.  I just wanted to get home.  When the waitress came to our table to get our plates, she asked if we were having dessert and when we said no, her friendly demeanor disappeared.  She said \\"Ok\\", took our plates, and curtly brought our check.  She seemed to be done being extra friendly.  When we'd asked earlier if it was always this busy (aka. Is it always this slow?) she said that they'd been featured on Phantom Gourmet that day and that it was Saturday night.  I understand that it was Saturday night, but we usually only go out on Saturday and other restaurants are usually prepared for the Saturday night craziness.  We might give this place another chance because I have learned that it is hard to judge a restaurant by any experience we have the weekend before or after my birthday, but if we have slow service like this on another Saturday night, that will be it.

Not bad, but not memorable either.  But, again another low-lit restaurant.  The waiter was friendly and welcoming, but seemed to not really know the ingredients of the menu.Looking over the Dining month menu I inquired with the waiter as to what type of tuna was used in the Tuna Conserva Antipasti.  He looked off into space as to search for the diverse types of tuna he can imagine, and then came up with, \\"Fresh Seared through Albacore\\".  When I received it, I could tell by just looking at it that it that it wasn't \\"Fresh\\", nor was it \\"Seared\\", and worse yet tasted tinny (as if came from a can).  Thinking about it now, it looked packed just like you would open a can of Albacore Tuna from Costco (which is probably exactly what it was).  The taste was pretty insipid.  I say if you don't know then go back and ask, then don't lie about what you're serving.  I don't mind tuna from a can, but keep it real.The next dish ordered was the Asparagus Soup.  Appealing in color and artfully presented, it could have used a little salt and was under seasoned in my opinion.The entre ordered was the Squid Ink Pasta. This dish was almost perfect.  Great flavor on the pasta as a whole and the shrimp and squid was appetizing.  The chorizo in the dish bestowed a little spice which was pleasant, but was exceptionally dry and leathery and had the consistency of jerky.Rounding out the dessert was a refreshing sorbet and caramelized almond ice cream dish.

Note to anyone who cares - there was a good 4-6 oz of cheese on top of the hash. I ended up scraping it off. Not that I don't like cheese, but c'mon. This wasn't bad thing but next time I'll just ask for no cheese! Served with your choice of \\"dirty\\" potatoes or grits (slightly sweet?) and biscuit (not house made) or toast it's a filling meal.

We were greeted by two pleasantly friendly waitresses and were promptly seated at a tall-table near the bar.  It was immediately apparent that we were the only two not from the \\"neighborhood\\".

It was such a comforting and relaxed environment.  We appreciate simple like that.\\n  As we looked over the menus we found that we were unable to make a decision. Everything people ordered around us looked good. Our waitress was more than happy to take the time to talk to us and help us decide.  I appreciate that. I do realize that this was a Monday at 6pm so business was slow but I have to say she was sincere.  We ordered the chicken parmesan and the fusilli puttanesca with a side of meatballs. While we waited we had a glass of wine and a bottle of beer and garlic bread. The drinks are kind of pricey in my opinion and we were a little dissapointed no beers were on tap. The garlic bread was nothing fancy but good and very buttery.  When our dinners came out I did feel a little disappointed again with the quantity.  Then again it was \\"$12.95 Monday\\". The chicken parm was cooked perfectly and the sauce was fresh, flavorful and light.  The puttanesca was loaded with capers and olives, (which I like) and curly fussili pasta that tasted fresh. Their meatballs though meaty were lacking in flavor. Perhaps they should have taken some of the  garlic from the puttanesca.

The server came over immediately with water and read off the specials but when we told him we were ready to order drinks he said he'd be back in a moment. We waited about 15 minutes just to order our drinks. A couple sat down next to us about 10 min after us and were able to order their drinks right after us (with the same server) (not really a big deal) They got their drinks first and then ordered apps and food. (At this point I was a little bothered because we were there before them and didn't even have our drinks) the server didn't try to take both tables orders at once, once the couple next to us ordered he left and didn't come back to our table until the drop off of our drinks. Finally we ordered our apps and entrees but we had to ask for bread because none was provided and at this point we were starving. We ended up getting our food in a timely manor after we ordered (because they have food runners) and the rest of the meal/time there was good.

We were kind of turned off but brushed it off and ordered our drinks. My friend ordered an espresso martini and the bartender made one. A woman sitting next to my friend saw the espresso martini and ordered one from the same bartender except hers was made totally different and had the appeal of a great drink while my friends was just thrown in a martini glass.

The last time we were there, however, we ate in the dinning area. I was unimpressed to say the least with the decor. All tables are lit with overhead lighting and the room had a very pale, uniformly colored look and feel because of that. We sat for almost ten minutes before a server appeared and he was unapologetic and uninterested. After we asked for a wine list (which took another five minutes to get) we waiting another 5-10 minutes to order drinks. Overall the service including the serving of several courses was very very slow.  During the course of our meal we had to ask at different times for a wine list, flatware, more water, and what was being served as the special. Meals were served to the wrong people. The food itself was only average. None of the four of us eating that night really liked their meal very much. I had vegetable risotto with scallops in which the risotto was served dry and cool, the vegetables way under cooked, and the scallops overcooked and chewy.  A Caesar salad prior to dinner was just whole leaves of Romaine lettuce with a pile a Parmesan cheese on the side and almost no dressing.  That salad was very ordinary.  We will eat here again but I'm not sure we will ever eat in the dining room anymore.

So then we're immediately seated and given two trays of chips. 10 minutes later the waitress comes by and says something to the effect that she'll be right back.

Two kids meals of quesadillas, one kids burger, one taco SALAD, and a soup and salad combo. Over 45 minutes we're visited twice by the fight waitress with ranch for the salad or ketchup for the fries that we didn't have.

After several minutes of back and forth banter, the two women walked out in tears. I have never seen a scene like this, especially in a restaurant that I thought I liked so much.

I will say one thing for Kings: they know how to throw a party. You really can't beat free bowling and billiards, plus no cover.We arrived at 9PM sharp, which was the \\"doors\\" time, and were 35th in line for bowling. We got some billiards balls and played about 3 rounds of free pool with the Patriots preseason opener on a big flat screen above our heads (it changed to a showing of the movie in question in the middle of the third quarter). Billiards was fun -- a little cramped, but the atmosphere was fantastic and a server was there instantly to take drink orders. I was not impressed with the drinks at all. They're the main reason for the imperfect rating. They were extremely watery -- I could barely taste the whiskey in my whiskey sour. Even my friend's Guinness tasted like it was watered down. They were also overpriced (understandable, I suppose, as they weren't making any money on pool or bowling last night). When our pager went off, we got our free shoe rentals and made our way to our bowling lane. The black lights made everything glow and the balls' weights were distinguished by their colors. I'm an avid candlepinner -- 10-pin really isn't my thing and my scores proved it -- but even though I was awful at the bowling part, I still had a lot of fun. The lanes weren't in the best shape and the balls were all chipped and dirty, but I really can't complain.Overall, I had a great experience at Kings.

They ruined any enjoyment of sitting down and enjoying the meal. I literally had to sit on my leather jacket and then stand up for one minute increments in the middle of my meal multiple times because I was literally in that much pain. The chairs remind me of elementary school auditorium seats- not inviting. Anyway here's the story: my parents were coming into town and my dad suggested that I find a restaurant for them to take me to for my birthday. I had read reviews about Beast before and I thought that it would be the perfect place for them to take me. My mom is a chef and she passed her taste for New American cuisine on to me; my whole family loves innovative food. I found BEAST on Yelp about a year ago and I had wanted to try it for some time. I made the reservation and was very excited to finally eat there. My parents and I walked in twenty minutes early because I had read on the reviews to go early if we wanted to get good seats. Anyway, they were not ready to seat anyone so they suggested we go next door to another restaurant/bar and hang out there. Okay, so the place is small and they were not ready to seat people early, I can live with that. We sit at the end of the table and they bring out wine glasses for everyone and start pouring wine. My mom ordered an ice tea and I order a Diet Coke because I don't drink and the woman informs us that they don't have tea or Diet Coke...The waitress paused and then with a sigh said she would go to the bar next door to get our drinks. Okay, so not very good service and only water and wine in the building. Kind of odd. The first course was Flageolet bean soup with greens and sumac oil. Sumac has always bothered my throat for some reason, but the soup was so warm and hearty that I ate it all. The second course was the charcuterie plate which consisted of a fois grais bon-bon with sauternes gelee (the sauternes gelee completely took away from the fois gras flavor so if you try this do it without the gelee), steak tartare and quail egg toast, chicken liver mousse and pickled shallot, boudin noir and duck fat apple pastry and Carlton Farms pork shoulder rillettes with a shaved fennel salad in the middle and a pickled beet and carrot on the side. I will tell you that the boudin noir and duck fat apple pastry was hands down my favorite item of the night. It was so delicious that I really have no words to describe it. The next course was the hanger steak with wild onion and swiss chard panade with asparagus and brown butter b√©arnaise. It was a good quality course- the panade was a little dry but the steak and asparagus were cooked to perfection. My least favorite dish came out next and it was Miners lettuce, aged sauvignon blanc vinaigrette, a marinated giant sea scallop and pistachio and spring herb salsa verde. I am not a fan of raw scallops, I really don't know why because I love sashimi but I just can't do raw scallops. However, the pistachio and spring herb salsa verde was to die for! Then out came the cheese course. I have no complaints about this other than there wasn't enough cheese! I am a cheese fanatic and they paired these cheeses perfectly with the whole meal. The cheese came with anise and fleur de sel shortbread and that my friends was a-m-a-z-i-n-g! There was also homemade quince paste, wildflower honey and fried Marcona almonds. Dessert was a rhubarb clafoutis with cardamom ice cream and they brought it out with a candle because I was celebrating my birthday so that was nice but really, it was a weird dessert. I would probably go back to Beast with a bunch of friends, but not on a date or anything- the seating was just way too awkward. See, I thought that it would be a fun experience for everyone and everyone would conversate at the table and have a good time, but it really was not like that. I sat by pretentious couples who were not up to talking, just eating and getting sloshed. But you know to sum up the review, for the quality of food and the price ($60 per person without wine) is a VERY good deal! Go there if you want to try it out- it's not bad, it's really not.

We were lucky to grab a table inside the restaurant as it was very windy and Florida cold out. The restaurant is small, but plenty of tables can be found outside if the weather agrees. Disney Springs has outside heaters plentiful and Chicken Guy had them but they weren't on at this point of the day so I was grateful for indoor seating. The chicken fingers are not small! Five was the right amount to split between us, especially with the fries. The breading to chicken ratio was just right, and they were crunchy and cooked just right, juicy and not dry in any way. The fries had what tasted like a seasoned salt type seasoning and were the great. We sampled four sauces, garlic parm, cumin lime mojo, special sauce and peri peri. I was expecting the peri peri to be the best, but I actually enjoyed the garlic parm most! Be warned though, the garlic is no joke!

The presentation was nice and the meat was tender and cooked just right, and the people were super nice.

Manny's is relatively new to the neighborhood and even though it's a chain restaurant, I thought I'd give them a fair shot.Manny's is in Baldwin Park, and if you're familiar with that area, then you know parking can be somewhat of a nightmare. Just go to one of the lots near Publix and take a walk over. Now I've seen a lot of Yelp reviews dunking on this place, but I honestly disagree. From what I've seen, Manny's is the real deal. The staff is super friendly, attentive, and helpful, and the food matches the service. I had a fajita dish that could very well rival the best of Orlando's fajita dishes. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and on point. The decor has a somewhat retro style which was fine by me. The menu offers a pretty cool selection of steak and non-steak items. Bottomless salad bowls are a weakness of mine that I am totally willing to admit to.As I said before, the staff is super friendly. Our waitress frequently stopped by to ask how we liked the food or if we needed something else. It's always nice to have a server check up on you on the busiest of nights.From what I've had so far, the good is freaking great. Their fajitas are delicious, and their steak rivals most other chain restaurants. I highly recommend giving them a chance if you're in the Baldwin Park area and you're looking for something new to check out.They have deals for discounted meals for children as well as BOGO for various items on the menu. If you're a parent, this isn't a bad place to take your kids to. They will fully accommodate you and your little ones.

Their brisket was really flavorful, with a great bark, but the meat was a tiny bit dry. However, I would still order it again. The fried plantains were amazing, and one of the best versions I've had. The corn was good, but nothing special and could have used more cheese.

For $3 we got 4 herbed GF rolls, and she thought that it was the best GF bread she'd ever had.  Would order again.The scallops came 3 to an order and were tasty, but the puree beneath was lukewarm like it had been plated too soon.  Needed salt.  Might order again.The calamari would have been awesome if the calamari had been grilled and served hot and if the other ingredients had been thrown into a saute pan for a minute.  Instead the rings were stark white and lukewarm and the peppers were raw and too pungent - just overwhelming.

Sometimes the line is intimidating, but it moves super quickly and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (plus you can bring your pooch if you sit outside). The only drawback and reason why I don't eat at Flower Child more often is the price. My bowl with added chicken and lemonade came out to $19-something before tip.

Our waitress, server, or what I like to refer to as what section is Amy working in tonight, because my husband, brother, and I have agreed that she is the jewel that makes these mealtimes special and uniquely enjoyable. Amy has a smile as she approaches us and even remembered that the last time we were in that our kitty was ill and asked about him. This is our baby and Amy cared to remembered and ask. Amy knows our cocktails and see that we are taken care of, even though it is busy and a lot of customers are hungry, Amy is taking care of each table and you can see everyone is enjoying her personality and personal attention to their and our needs as if we were the only ones in the restaurant. Good food should be expected and good service makes the meal. Excellent service makes a dining experience and Amy will be our server as we hunt down her tables.  I am so glad that Shilo recognizes the importance of her contribution to their establishment! Also try the lobster bisque. You will not be disappointed Will be back soon and will be in Amy's section.

The theming is so unique and fun!  Your senses are completely assaulted from the moment you walk in.  Don't be deterred by the super cheesy and funny t-shirts sold in the front lobby.  They are sure to make you smile.  The service is a bit hit or miss depending on the day.  Mostly awesome service when it's not a super popular night.  Check the hours of business because they vary by the location.  The food is consistently good.  The tortillas are made fresh in a spot that is easily visible from the restaurant seating.  My only complaint is the servers often get my order wrong because they are either trying to remember the order without writing it down, or they are distracted by having too many tables in their section.  Your server will basically take your order, drop off your drinks, check on you after someone else drops off your food, then delivers your bill.  We often have dishes piled up as the servers don't seem to like to pick up anything from the tables except the payment at the end.  Definitely try the queso that has the guac and steak.  So yummy with those warm chips! The kids meals are great complete with ice cream at the end.  The portion sizes are fair for the prices but check once in a while they have specials you need to ask your server about.

This restaurant would be a great candidate for one of those restaurant intervention reality shows.  I really wish this place would work.  But it doesn't.I visited this past Sunday and my friend and I were first seated in a weirdly placed booth in a corner.  When you walk into Social Vinings you go through the bar area and then down some steps.  The booth we were first placed in is the first booth to your left as you go down the stairs.  It's kind of out of the way.  Kind of dark. And it's stinky.  It stank.  It wasn't a loud stink (if there could be such a thing).  But more of a subtle, sour-milk-maybe-someone-peed-here-in-the-past stink.  Yuck.So we moved.  Shame on us for not leaving at that point.After being seated at our next table, we noted that service was slow.  Shockingly slow for a restaurant only about 15% full.  I ordered coffee.  It was awful and I sent it back.  I needed a new knife because there was a beautiful fingerprint on my knife.  Nice if I was looking for a perpetrator.  Yucky when I'm eating.Finally, my salmon dish came.  It featured two beautifully cut wedges of cream cheese.  Each wedge featured a fingerprint.  Though I often play detective when watching my favorite crime shows, I do not want to see fingerprints engraved in my cream cheese.  I sent the whole dish back.  Do not play ink pad with my cream cheese.

Located on the second floor on Tyler Street, the landmark for this place is the bright yellow awning with its name on it.  Upon entering, there are about 15 or so tables, half of them being large circular tables where two couples/small groups would share.  The menu arrives along with hot tea.  Unlike many of the other dim sum restaurants, there are no carts shuffling through the aisles, this place is on the small side so logistically it doesn't work.  The men does include some pictures (front and back of a laminated piece of paper) though it is not all-inclusive.  You mark down on a sheet of paper which items you would like, and they come out piping hot as they are being prepared.  With my dining companion, we shared the following items:1.  Steamed Shrimp & Chive dumplings\\n2.  Steamed Chicken dumplings\\n3.  Sticky Fried Rice\\n4.  Scallion Pancake\\n3.  Rice Noodles with ShrimpI'm not a red meat eater, but found tons of options to choose from (hence the emphasis on shrimp and chicken).  My favorites were the rice noodles and the steamed shrimp and chive dumplings.  Though I would be remiss if I didn't say that I liked everything!!!  I also wanted to get the eggplant in lieu of one of the items, but my dining partner was not in the mood for eggplant.  Another time.....As previously mentioned, the prices are great considering the quality of the food.  The dim sum items are $3.15 each and the most expensive item for us was the sticky rice at $5.25.

It has been a while since my last visit, but it used to be a reliably good upscale lunch spot in DTX.  No more!  I ordered a blackened cod sandwich, which was without question frozen - the fish had the telltale texture of frozen fish and was SQUARE!!!  Also not \\"blackened\\" at all, just damply coated with bland red spices.  Absolutely shocking level of quality for $17.  They should be ashamed to serve a frozen fish filet sandwich in Boston (outside of a fast food place, I guess, but there at least you know what you're in for and the price reflects it).My lunch companion ordered the veggie burger, which was less a burger than a large fried croquet of dry quinoa and vegetables which disintegrated at the touch of the fork.  It was impossible to eat as a sandwich and appeared very unappetizing.  It's still a lovely spot and feels very gracious, but that's all that was worthy of even one star."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I had a great experience at this restaurant.

I think this is a perfect location for Georgia tech students and I will definitely be back. The inside does not seat a lot, only about 20 or so max.

It was cool that the break and olives were included in the bill, which is totally unheard of in Portugal but would probably not fly well in Boston.  Although I was appreciative that there was bread, it was somewhat stale.  I did love that they had an appetizer of tomatoes with queijo fresco, which is a mild, soft, white cheese.

It's one of the mainstays that I used to go to with my ex, and I do still frequent it from time to time because of a number of reasons: their specials are great, they're open late, and they do what they do well really well. Nevertheless, when I come here and dip into a couple of drinks, I can't help but feel nostalgia pulling on my heart strings.  This review has been a long time coming, so here it is!Food 4/5 -- Like I said, they do what they do well, really well. Their burgers are spot on. Love the lamb burger and taco burger. Keep meaning to try the Aussie burger, but just waiting till I'm hungry enough! Their food specials are also really good. One of the best burger spots in town, tapas selection is decent, but leaves a lot to be desired. I rarely ever dip into.Service 4/5 -- Great service, but the service staff work huge sections so there's often a long wait on food or drinks. It's not terrible, but I imagine it's hard to manage when they have one table that's more demanding than all the rest. I get it though; on off nights they have peak hours where everyone comes in, so it's hard to justify having an extra person in just for that rush.Cleanliness 4/5 -- Does get a little messy here but as mentioned earlier they have great service staff, so I feel like it gets mitigated a bit. But again, this is a result of having just a couple people working huge sections. Just to give a couple examples; tables and menus can sometimes be sticky, and floors have noticeable debris; however I do want to reiterate that given the circumstances they do a heck of a job of mitigating that.Atmosphere 4/5. Love the brick walls. The bar and booth seating in the front is awesome. Not a huge fan of the bar seating in the back. Also not a fan of the carpeted floors. As an EDM music, I also have to add that I like the non-EDM music selection. Reminds me of the music I listened to in high school.The bathroom has a long corridor leading down to it -- great for burning off calories, and sweating out alcohol. Overall 4/5 -- I want to reiterate that the parts where I made it sound harsh, please remember that each section STILL got 4/5, which is a great rating.

Located on a side street (Sexsmith), you'll have to look for it as its address is \\"No 3 Rd\\".  It's one of those strip malls that bends into the side street and hence to challenge to find it unless you searched it on the map ahead of time. The menu includes a usual variety of fried rice/noodle, baked rice, and hot plate meat and rice items.  Of course, it also has its share of HK style drinks and BBT.  Of note is its offering of over 10 different types of baked rice! I had the baked curry deep fried pork chop rice and it was really good. One interesting feature is the \\"lo ding\\" Êíà‰∏Å which is very HK.  It's \\"lo mein\\" which usually meansÔøΩ?it's a noodle without soup that comes with certain toppings. But \\"lo ding\\" means it uses instant noodles.  The \\"ding\\" comes from the popular Made in HK instant noodle Âá∫Ââç‰∏ÄÔøΩ?(cheot chin yat ding in Cantonese; chu qian yi ding in Mandarin; demae itcho in Japanese), derived from Japan's Nissin noodle maker decades ago.

Kids usually have the run of a place like that, climbing over chairs, crying, racing around the tables, etc. I put the blame for this behavior squarely on parents, who somehow forget about basic manners when their kids are in their orbit. They not only let their children behave like animals, they are obnoxious themselves. I can't tell you how many times I have encountered a parent who was in their own world as they watched over their little one. Hey dad, how about having the decency to hold the door open for other people, as well as your kid? How about putting the smartphone down so you can tell your kid to quit bothering the poor lady that's trying to eat her meal?You will see all of these things and more at Phil's Icehouse. On any given weekday night, you will see at least two children running around tables, repeatedly going in and out of the side door that leads to the playground, hogging the bathrooms, etc. So why the four star review? Because the food really is that good. The cheeseburgers are as good as any you will find in north Austin, and the fries are actually good the next day. Unbelievable, right? But it's true, and it actually makes me forget about the fact that this is a place that caters to a clientele that I typically avoid. Now granted, I will get my food to go depending on how crowded it is, but there are definitely moments when the restaurant quiets down and you can enjoy a really great meal that is prepared by an incredibly friendly staff.Don't get me wrong- I know full well that I am injecting my bias into this review, and I understand that this atmosphere appeals to a VERY large segment of the population. North Austin is the suburbs, after all. So if you are looking for a family restaurant that has great amenities for your kids, along with great food, then this is definitely right up your alley. Just TRY to mind your kids (as well as your own manners) when you get here, ok? It will make a great restaurant even better."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"While in the area we thought we would go to Rino's for lunch, fantastic choice!

Amazing, especially with the pineapple.\\n- I got the chicken fajitas.  I have never had such incredibly tender chicken in my fajita before!

It's in a great location, right on the intersection of posh and friendly, which is where I like a bar to land.The space is beautiful inside, a little tight to negotiate when the place is at full strength like it was last night, but still I managed to get to the back bar where the crowd was gathering. Incidentally, it took no time at all for that space to become overbearingly hot.  My philosophy is always the smaller the area the higher you crank the AC, but then again, I am sure they sold a lot more beverages doing it their way.Seriously, though, it's a great bar, and the staff is wonderful. Everyone was friendly and helpful, and we all got the same smiles and banter whether the watch was a Rolex or a Fauxlex, and that is rare in  Buckhead Bar.  The drinks were expertly mixed and delivered quickly and with good humor all around.The food was amazing.  Loved, loved, loved the crab fritters! This little puff of hot, crispy deliciousness that dissolved into this creamy, cloud when you bit into it. And they did not skimp on the crab; every bite was meaty with that sweet, mild sea-flavor.I had a great time. So why only three stars? I had to take one away when I learned after I got my car back last night that a valet had helped himself to a tip. Here's the deal. There is a little \\"hidden\\" compartment in my car where I usually stash a couple of dollars, for tips, tolls, little emergencies. Last night, I had left a single dollar in it, with the thought that I could combine with another and use that as my exit tip for the valet. I always tip twice at a comp valet, just in case the guy who brings the car is not the same as the guy who takes it. So, when I pulled up to BBB I dutifully reached in my bag and handed the valet 2 singles.  When I left, I was all set to give him 2 more, until I got in my car and saw that the little compartment was open and the other half of his exit tip was gone, gone, gone.  Now, granted, it was buck. and what he took was basically his own money anyway, since I had earmarked it for him. But he didn't know that.  And now, even though it isn't the bar's fault, I am always going to think twice about whether I want to go and eat or drink there again. Because I am going to have to weigh the hassle of self-parking, against the yumminess of the meal I know would await me inside.

Bella Sera seems to be a sister establishment to the Marble Falls eatery by the same name. Tucked on the end of a strip mall on Bee Caves between Cuernavaca and Hwy 71, decor was fresh and clean with simple tables, a wooden floor, booths around the perimeter and lovely murals of Venice and Pisa hand-painted on the walls. There is a place for outdoor seating with a water feature but no tables were set up yet.  No table cloths or placemats, and silverware wrapped in paper napkins. The lack of upholstery with the wood floors contributed to the high noise level, since there was little to baffle the sound, a common problem in strip mall eating establishments.\\n   The service from Nick was very good, even if he was still learning the menu. Great humor and attention to detail added to our favorable impression, particularly after our Waterloo experience earlier in the week. \\n   The Bella Sera strombolli was very good, crisp outside, packed with all the filling ingredients and was easily enough for 2 people. Interestingly there is an upcharge for spinach, tomatoes, jalapenos and anchovies on pizzas, calzones and strombolis. \\n   The Bella Sera salad, at $6.95 was uninspired, consisting of iceburg lettuce in a bowl with a few mushrooms, black olives and mozzarella cheese sprinkled over and garnished with a single tomato slice.(I've  NEVER seen iceburg lettuce in the markets or used in a salad during my numerous trips to Italy.)  The tomato and basil house dressing, which Nick thoughtfully brought on the side, readily brought cocktail sauce to mind in taste and texture (where was the basil?).  The Italian dressing replacement was standard.\\n   The pizza at the next table looked scrumptuous and the place at 8:30 on a Friday was doing a brisk business and several nearby tables were obviously enjoying the Specialities which included the usual lasagna, manicotti,chicken/veal/shrimp marsala, piccata, damabianca, rossini, and tetrazini. There is a kid menu, a nice assortment of seemingly vegetarian although not vegan selections and hot subs available.\\n   They are pending a liquor license so enjoy bringing in your own wine.

The fries that one person chose as a substitute were too salty to eat. The other person had ordered a dish that is supposed to be topped with mashed potatoes (think fish shepherd's pie) and so it was served without the potatoes, perhaps explaining why it was too salty to eat. That dish should have been taken off the menu if such an important component of it could not be be included. A third person in our group ordered a dish that was supposed to have a Szechuan sauce, described as sweet and spicy. That dish had no sweetness or heat or flavor -- it was a soggy mouthful of salt. This dish was sent back, and, oddly, the fries in the replacement dinner of fish and chips were not at all too salty.\\n  We also had to send back an order of tuna, which was cold in the middle -- not room temperature, not cool, but cold.

I make sure my kids are well behaved when we go out so other people aren't subjected to screaming/ throwing/ arguing/ whatever.   We don't leave food on the floor, or make big messes on the table.  But maybe because we are a big group it's an issue.   Still, asking for napkins, or an extra pair of chopsticks, or a fork, or you know... water...  I have this unreasonable expectation that there is a greater than 5% chance it will actually be brought.  I took my son and his friends to Maki Maki for his 12th birthday where they offer a free dessert for anyone celebrating their birthday.  They gave me a hard time when I couldn't produce a picture id for him.   No exaggeration.   (I do see the website says id needed now... so if it's your birthday and you're too young to drive, better have a passport kid).\\n We do get put in the corner a lot, just walking in. With the other families. \\n So maybe it is a kid thing.  For goodness sake keep us away from the real customers!  The service is so bad, it sometimes takes half an hour to pay.  To PAY!   And the AYCE would be much better if a waiter came by to take another order.  We're still hungry.  We want to order more food. And we can't. Because our waiter hasn't come back since before I just grew this beard.  Try to comprehend how frustrating it is to go hungry at an all you can eat restaurant.  Sometimes I literally have to go out and search for our waiter, like I'm hunting wabbit.   I should bring a bolo with me next time.   I always am super nice and thankful to waitstaff, from the host(ess), to the waiters, to the busboys, and teach my kids to do the same.  Because the job sucks and it is really awful to have to deal with rude or entitled customers.   Those people are being paid to treat you with service, and should be appreciated for it.     However, here we don't feel like customers we feel like an inconvenience.\\nMy wife, who has a higher tolerance for BS than me (lucky me) now refuses to go there.  That in itself is a strong statement, as I can't think of any other establishment where she refuses to go because of the awful service.   My family eats fast, because we are hungry little hobbits, but somehow the average mealtime here is 1.5 to 2 hours.   Just. Sitting. Waiting. \\nOk, so we've established that we can't get any of the fabled fine service at Maki Maki.   How is the food?  it's okay.   The sushi is alright, not the freshest, but not usually to the point where it's downright iffy (although I've had tuna which was questionable).  The hot food is meh - not horrible, but... not something I want to order again.  My wife and daughter haven't particularly enjoyed anything they ordered, though they'll eat the chicken teriyaki  when pressed.  The spring rolls taste like frozen (which is understandable, but buy a better brand please).   But still, they do have sushi and despite my wife's ban I decided recently to pick up some sushi for my son.   I ordered for myself  a sashimi lunch, with fish only (since I have a shellfish allergy).  I asked for fish only as I'm allergic to crabstick (which I know is not real crab meat, but it's cooked with crab essence - I'm allergic to the essence), so I pick up the food and it's all decent enough except my lunch plate has a few slices of fish and the other half is tamago and sliced bean curd.  Why is that upsetting? Because I paid for a sashimi plate and got half egg and bean curd, and all of it in little bitty slices.   The whole thing was not enough to feed my 5 year old, who doesn't even eat a lot for a 5 year old!\\nBut it's not all bad.  The parking is never a problem and when you order hot sake it comes hot.\\nOne more note for those of you looking for quality sushi: my son prefers the sushi from the mall.   Nuff said.I so very much want to like this place, nice location, AYCE sushi, good parking... but this places sucks.   The food sucks.   The service SUCKS.   If we're in the area jonesing for sushi we'll take the extra 5 to 10 minutes to drive to somewhere that will treat us more respectfully and serves fresher sushi to boot."},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is designed for sharing small dishes and family style entrees.

Parking can be a little tricky, look for the the public parking located just south of the entrance or a little further east.The inside is fairly non-descript.  There are a couple of TVs, including a large project screen, some rather old tables, and couple of pool tables.  A long bar is on the south side and serves a variety of drinks.  There is also a help-yourself popcorn machine, which I like to take advantage of.The staff are always friendly.  The owner usually works lunch and usually takes a moment to talk with you.  Another plus, the drinks are served in HUGE cups, I'd guess 24oz or bigger.  I wish more restaurants did this as it cuts down on the waiter visiting your table every 5 minutes to fill you up.For a place like this, the menu is quite extensive.  There are 15-20 different kinds of sandwiches served with fries, onion rings, or other side dishes (the macaroni salad is a favorite of mine.)  Their Reuben and Kick-Ass Roast Beef (roast beef with provolone and Jalapeno peppers) are really good.  They also serve large salads that can be topped with anything from ham to buffalo chicken strips.Signatures is one of my favorite lunch stops in Gahanna.

I recommend checking your order before driving away from the window because the last thing you want it to get home and you notice you are missing a taco or got the wrong type of tortilla.

I dig some Indian food, but a hiatus is on for some weeks\\n2.  damn, I want to eat a cow instead of worry about if my rickshaw is going to hit one that is napping mid-road. (trust me, I got pictures of it)To satisfy the latter, the craving tends to present itself in the form of steak tips or (sometimes) burgers.  And for steak tips, the places that are more townie tend to do them the best.And sadly, Highland Kitchen is not towny.  It's definitely neighborhoody - but not towny.   The vibe and decor is cool - it gets crowded, but didn't feel tight or claustrophobic.  And unlike so many other places in town, they haven't littered their walls with flat screens (as my companions were quick to point out and enjoy).But for all its comfort and very friendly staff, the tips were just....tips.  They weren't cooked how I ordered them - they weren't flavored as anything but beef - and the HK steak sauce was easily mistaken for A1 out of the bottle.  Add to that, fries that tasted burnt (though that was probably what they were going for - the charred variety) and it all rounded out a relatively unimpressive plate.So after months of anticipation for my first try at HK - and after weeks of hankerin' for some moo, the experience was a bit of a let down.Yet somehow I am still drawn back to this place, and I imagine that I will return again soon.

The price for AYCE dinner comes to around $28 per person + an additional $10ish for the soup bases. I was with 7 others, one with a restrictive diet, so we got two different soup bases. We had #4 and #11 which were pretty good. The quality of the meats and seafood is ok. Tastes like how it would taste at home (for the most part). There's a large selection of other items as well. There are dumplings/dim sum items on the list and they come out frozen. I recommend that you use the boiler on the top of the hotpot to \\"defrost\\" the frozen items a bit before placing them into the pot. The barbeque items are not very good because the grill section for the barbeque is not very effective. It took forever to cook one chicken wing. They start you off with a cup of tea, and you can ask for ice water as well. My cup had a little surprise though. It tasted like chlorine or bleach or something like that. I tried my friends water and theirs did not taste like mine. Service was good. Fluent Cantonese servers/waiters/waitresses as it is a Chinese restaurant. They come over once in a while to ask if anyone needs tea or water refills. This was good as it was extremely busy (especially on a Saturday evening). Although, near the end of our meal, they sent over some dishes that were not ours. Probably just a minor mistake, so it did not irk me. What did irk me was the fact that we wrote 20 mussels on the sheet, but only received 7. Although 20 is indeed an excessive amount, I think we should have been informed as to why we weren't given the amount. Finally, double check your bill! Ask to go over it with your server. Our bill had a few extra items that were not ordered. It was fixed though, so that was good. They take cash and cards (debit confirmed, not sure about credit). Overall I personally will not be making reservations here for any of my own events, but I am willing to come here if invited by others, since it is not too bad, and you can get a substantial amount of food (we didn't actually finish all of our order)."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yes, just yes.

Like the Korean beef, it was cooked perfectly. The taste was amazing. I loved the animal protein very much.Based on the cashier's suggestion, we upgraded to the noodles. The noodles were very bland and not as hot as the rest of the food. I don't want to call them cold, that would be unfair. But they were just slightly warm and tasteless. I added a bunch of mustard and red hot sauce that was on the table. This made it more tasty. I blame myself, my expectation was that the noodles would be pan fried or cooked with the protein.

The melding of the bar area and dining area, coupled with the highly regarded drinks they serve, can qualify it as a gastropub. Still, the collard greens and shrimp and grits make it hard to argue against it as a purveyor of fine soul food. But what of the gnocchi and curried goat; does that turn it into a New American Fusion place? And the weekly bluegrass has got to make it a relaxed music venue too, right? Yet it is spoken of by locals with the familiar fondness of a neighborhood diner. This is a restaurant that wears a lot of hats, which is not surprising in Boston's aggressive culinary landscape. What is surprising is the ease in which the Highland Kitchen handles the burden. It's identity is somehow clearly defined, if not easily categorized. You can sit down to a fine and inspired meal there. You can get a great drink there. You can listen to music or watch a game there. It's a date place that is simultaneously casual enough and classy enough to impress someone while putting them at ease. Highland Kitchen succeeds because of the passion and proficiency of the staff. The menu is not massive, but it does not need to be. The cooks in the kitchen focus their work on a dozen or so main entrees and sandwiches, serving them with an efficiency and aplomb that eschews needless showiness. The pappardelle bolognese was meaty and deepened (but not overpowered) by a hint of truffle oil. The pulled pork sandwich tasted like a pulled pork sandwich (surprising how rare in life that is) and served with an apologetically simple mound of french fries. The collection of dips and pita chips served as an appetizer was so simple and perfect that you spend the entire meal insisting you can make it at home but lamenting it just wouldn't come out as well. When you leave (you'll never be rushed out), you'll leave full and happy. If you live within walking distance, you'll be thrilled that such a gem can be found on foot. And within a day, you'll be thinking about how such a perfect show of culinary balance could be managed and when your next meal there will be."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is for sure the place to be, It is so cute and cozy.

Ever.  The crust was extra Chris and you could definitely taste the honey and the batter, but it wasn't too much. Inside was incredibly moist and juicy.  The coleslaw that comes with it is it more of a vinegar-based than mayonnaise and is pretty delicious as well.  All the food comes in takeout containers, which I wasn't crazy about, but I get what they're going for and it makes for super easy cleanup.  But they need to be more napkins available and wet wipes would be a great option for the people that order fried chicken or ribs.  One person at our table got a burger, which was served with the Mento cheese, and she said it was delicious.The bar... Huge line and long wait.  We tried several cocktails, which were delicious, but pretty pricey for the size.  My theory is that the ring free cocktails our labor intensive, yet small movie, and that was part of what created the backlog of the bar.  Only one beer on tap and it wasn't as cold as it needed to be. They also ran out of glasses at one point.

Also got the Thomas, an english muffin sandwich that comes dripping with water from the greens, too big to be eaten like an actual sandwich. Their Moon Brine pickle was atrocious; mushy in the middle, tasted like a sour dust rag. The coffee cake was so dry, I can't imagine being able to swallow it without something to drink close by.

Having been to many great eateries in Portland and knowing Beast and Naomi Pomeroy's reputation, I was expecting a meal in my top three.  Didn't happen, due to some inconsistencies, poor wine pairings, and some environmental issues, namely, the chairs and the cooking going on during the later courses. First and foremost, I will echo other's lament about the chairs.  I have never had a dinner experience so greatly affected by the seating.  The chairs were absolutely awful.  I had to get up about five times during service just due to being incredibly uncomfortable.  The chairs are no joke; bring a pillow.  One would think after several reviews stating this concern, Beast would do something about this.The food was hit and miss, as was the wine pairings.  The zucchini and pepper soup was good, with the French sparkling wine being a big hit.  It was one of those pairings where the wine so enhanced the food it was transporting.  The negative?  Hard, extremely crunchy \\"fried bread\\" floating around in the soup.  Too hard, they distracted from the tastiness of the soup.  The Charcuterie plate was also a mixed bag.  The chicken liver mousse was transcendent, and the cracker perfect under it.  First the sweetness hits your tongue, the earthiness of the mousse.  As perfect as it gets. I love Foie Gras but the combination of that and the peanut cracker was not for me.  Also, the bon bon was really difficult to cut and really too large to eat in one bite, so you're stuck with too much in your mouth or a mess.  The tartare was good but lacked seasoning.  The wine was a decent local Riesling but did very little to enhance the food.The main course of duck confit was delicious. Moist but with a nice crispy skin, it fit very well with the Tarragon aioli, fresh and perfectly cooked green beans and tomato.  But, as it was presented as a cassoulet, it was served with a few sad, overcooked beans.  The wine was a Shiraz.  Personally not a fan of Shiraz.The melon salad was interesting, and once I got the crispy shallots, mint sauce and chevre together with the melon in a bite, it was very nice. But there were rinds on the melon!  Why?  The wine pairing was another perfect match; this time, they got it right. At this point in the service,  the staff started prepping for Saturday night's meal by cooking duck in the kitchen, which had a very strong smell.  The rest of my courses, after they started to cook the duck, tasted of duck.  The smell would be enticing towards the beginning of the meal but was so distracting at the end that my dinner companion was slightly nauseated.Then they lost me at the cheese plate.  I'm not sure who \\"Steve\\" at Cheese Bar is, but he is doing a disservice to Beast.  An avid cheese eater who loves goat and sheep cheese, I couldn't finish the cow/sheep combo, and found the other two just okay.  The cow/sheep combo tasted grainy and spoiled.  The full-flavored poached plum helped me get through the boring cheese.  I was saving the almonds for last as I love Marcona almonds but even they were bad and tasted very strong and slightly off.  The dessert?  Meh.  Except the creme fraiche ice cream.  Yes, I said cr√®me fraiche ice cream.  It was very delicious.  There are so many great places to have similar food in Portland that will not disappoint.  Skip Beast and explore some other options."},{"name":"Zippity Do Dog","address":"160 Speen St","city":"Framingham","stars":"4","text":"I wish I wasn't already overweight.

The broth was delicious. It was very flavorful and had a nice body. Unfortunately there were only six medium-sized shrimps and four large mushrooms, that's it. For $13 there should have been more in it. Next, was the beef salad. The menu describes the beef salad as marinated beef, seared and sliced thin, with cucumbers, tomatoes, chilies and onions. What we got was, yesterday's left over roast beef, in a lime vinaigrette. The beef was chewy and didn't taste marinated at all. The last item we ordered was the lobster in red curry. It was decent; the curry was nice. The broccoli didn't fit well in the dish. Overall, the food has potential to be really good but it's not quite there yet.

There is nothing I love more than tapas - getting the opportunity to try all sorts of different foods instead of just one entree. I know this place usually has a crazy line on the weekends, but we went in on a Friday morning around 10AM and were seated immediately! We were seated at the kitchen bar, where we could see all the food coming out. If you have the option, definitely come on a weekday. If not, I truly do think it's worth the wait (and I am not the most patient person). We were just a party of two, so we weren't able to try too many of the items, but the ones we did get were fantastic! The potato doughnuts, though small, are incredibly heavy, rich, and filling. Oh, and delicious! I could've eaten 100 of those bacon wrapped dates. We got the burger, which was the least exciting part of the meal, but still good.  They were soooo satisfying. I saw that the summer muffin had beet mayo, and I can't say no to anything with beets. Best part of the entire meal. Holy cow. The flavors worked so well, and all of it tasted so fresh and perfect. I can't even go on enough about how good it was. The service was fantastic, and the food came out scattered and quickly - just how I want it with small plates.

It was not helped by the fact that several people I know have eaten there and raved about it, and that Chef Naomi has achieved a level of fame as a great and innovative cook.The dining room is set up around an open kitchen and is two long tables. On the night I was there, we had plenty of room between my party and the other guests. I was excited at the chance to have a front row seat for the preparation of the meal.First off, I have to say that none of the food I ate at Beast was necessarily bad. I am being particular in this review, but I think that is warranted given the price of the dinner and the acclaim of the restaurant.Course 1 was a consomme, which did have a very good flavor and was crystal clear. Not blown away but no problems with this one, it was a simple delicious cup of soup.Course 2 was the famous charcuterie plate:\\nFois Gras Bon Bon - Very unique and tasty, the sauternes gelee was a nice sweet topping.\\nChicken Liver Mousse - This one had a deep flavor and was probably my favorite thing on this plate.\\nSteak Tartare - Steak on toast, not impressed.\\nPork Liver Terrine - This one looked pretty cool, but again lacked the amount of flavor I would have expected.\\nRabbit Rillettes - light colored paste, wouldn't have a guess in the world what this was without the description in front of me.\\nHome made head cheese - I like a thin slice of fat as much as the next guy, but I didn't understand this one. It looked thin piece of white fat with a couple flecks of something. I'm not a head cheese expert, but it didn't taste good so there you go.Course 3 was a lamb loin chop. I'm not going to even bother to talk about anything else on this plate since the main attraction fell flat. I think the lamb loin chop was a terrible choice for the main meat course in a menu like this. The bone to meat ratio on this cut is not very good and I would have greatly preferred a normal lamb chop here. Our chops were neither seared on the outside nor medium to medium rare on the inside (we were not asked about what temperature we would like).Course 4 was a bread salad.\\nWhat?!\\nThere is no room in a 6 course menu for soup, salad, and cheese. Why is it coming after the meat course? I totally didn't understand this one. I could have made this dish in my kitchen with the lights off.\\nAt least they made the bread in house and it was fresh and delicious...nope...that didn't happen.Course 5 was a selection of cheeses from Steve at the Cheese Bar.\\nThanks Steve. Next time I'll go to the cheese bar and save myself $100.Course 6 was an olive oil cake with strawberry & apricot sauce.\\nThis dessert wasn't bad, and it reminded me of a dessert my dad used to make when I was young. Although that version started with little pound cakes from the supermarket so it wasn't exactly a fancy restaurant dessert.Now that we have the food out of the way, I would like to discuss the ambiance of the dinner as well as what we observed in the preparation and \\"cooking\\" of our meal. Some of these issues never would have come up if the kitchen was the traditional back of house setup. As much as we don't want to think about it, they can do whatever they want back there and most of the time we are none the wiser. In this layout, on the other hand, a conscious decision was made to have an open kitchen. That means we can see everything you are doing so maybe don't act like we can't.Let's talk about the cooking. All but one of the items were understandably heavily prepped and essentially just plated for service. I wanted to see more kitchen action, but I understand. I would have liked another hot course (goodbye bread salad). The main course, however, is  a different issue. I was sure they were going to grill or pan sear the lamb in front of us and serve it hot out of the pan straight to our table. I was sorely disappointed when a hotel pan came out of the oven that had been in there since we arrived at the restaurant to reveal our (over done by this point) loin chops. Plop, plop. plop on the plates just the same as a cold appetizer or salad course. Long story short, NOTHING was live cooked on the stove for us. Am I missing something about fine dining? Furthermore, did I misunderstand the fact that this was an open kitchen? I wanted a look at the action!Finally Naomi, talk to us! Tell us about the dishes, ask us how things were. People are here in a big way because of you. Maybe pay a little more attention to your paying customers that are 10 feet away from you rather than taking iPhone pictures of your own dessert and discussing your weekend with your sous chef's boobs (I'm running out of characters to talk about appropriate work wear). Finally a shout out to the dishwasher with the shorts and thigh high bacon socks, you're awesome."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"My review is based on one visit for brunch. I should say that prior to this point, I visited Beat Hotel one or two other times and found the beer selection to be on par with other good places around Cambridge when considering variety and price. The proceeding review pertains to my first dining experience:A group of friends made a reservation at BH on a Sunday morning. We were forced to take an earlier reservation time as we were told that large groups were already expected at 11am. Okay, fine, so we take a 10am reservation. Once seated, drink orders were taken. And then we waited...and waited...and waited a bit more. It took awhile for our food orders to finally go in, which was a bit surprising because the place was not busy at all. On the plus side, the food came out quickly and almost all at once, which was appreciated.As to the food, I had the Azteca Bowl with poached eggs. The dish was good, but for $17, I definitely expected more. The dish lacked spice, and while it's nice to find a healthier option on a brunch menu, there wasn't much to make it a truly filling dish. Seeing how quickly several friends finished their meals, I sense that they also found their meals on the small side. Again, not so bad if the prices were less, but the cheapest dish was ~$15! That's quite hefty!Similarly, brunch drinks were crazy expensive. I wanted to order something fun, but the cheapest cocktail started at $11! Come on, now--it's one thing if you are serving a truly unique or different beverage, but if you are just combining a bit of champagne and OJ, you need not charge $11. I couldn't fork over that kinda money, and I have to admit, I'm glad I didn't after seeing how much I paid for the meal alone.So overall: ambiance is nice; service is cordial albeit slow; menu options are interesting but overpriced. If BH can balance price to performance, I think it will be a great Cambridge option.

I should mention also that we had ordered from this place about a year ago for awhile and then we stopped before trying them out again a few weeks ago.  Tonight I remembered why we stopped going here a year ago.  \\nFirst of all, the wait time and the customer service in the restaurant while we waited were abominable.  The lady working the register seemed to be annoyed that we were there waiting for our food and never apologized for our having to wait so long in a completely deserted restaurant.  We were literally the only customers in the restaurant and she didn't make eye contact, smile at us, or keep us updated about our order.  When we finally did get our food and get home (we didn't check in the restaurant because the ticket attached to the tied up plastic bag had the correct order on it, and we'd already been waiting for 15 minutes), the additional egg roll we'd ordered and paid for wasn't in the bag, the sauce that comes with the egg rolls wasn't in the bag, there was no fortune cookie, the food was cold and appeared to have been reheated in the microwave (which makes me wonder what was taking them so long to get the food out in the first place...was it sitting around?), it didn't taste fresh at all, not to mention the sauce had a burnt taste to it that lingered in your mouth after eating (very unpleasant), and the rice was stale.  \\nAfter eating what we could, because we were hungry and had just spent $15 on the disgusting \\"meal,\\" both I and my boyfriend felt sick to our stomachs.

Other standouts were the scallops, corn fritters with rum raisin butter, the char su pork belly served on a crispy bao, and--though it wasn't served that night--I'm super excited to be able to have their edamame with pop rocks again. Another delicious thing I hadn't tried, until now, was their cocktails. Their \\"strawberry fields\\" had an ice ball made of crushed strawberries, kefir, and coriander that melted into vodka and sparkling wine, and when it got too sweet, they'd pour over another serving of liquor for a reduced price.

That is why they have a big bottle of sriracha at the condiment table. This is the way any good street cuisine is done. From Mexico to Thailand and Vietnam. Start with a quality product and let the diner add the cilantro, onion, hot sauce, etc. BTW. I will second the steak tacos with the avocado wasabi."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"1065 Cleveland Ave","city":"East Point","stars":"2.5","text":"Spilt chick fill a sauce all in my pocket and didn't offer to help clean it or give me my food for free terrible customer service who gives Polynesian sauces that are already been opened... smh"},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great service.

A little greasy but not bad. I probably would order here again if I was in a bind, and when I say bind I mean that every restaurant in Somerville is closed down for the night and is on fire and won't open ever again. The customer service is the reason why they're getting two stars. I visited this past Thursday night with my 9 year old niece, and it was getting pretty cold out. They have tables with seating on one side so I assumed they were a sit down restaurant. I asked to use the bathroom after paying and they told us we had to go to a neighboring business to relieve ourselves. If I had known that before paying I would've taken my business elsewhere. Fortunately a nearby restaurant allowed us to use their facilities and I felt obligated to give a tip.  My niece and I decided to eat there because we were really hungry, after eating we asked for a trash barrel to dispose of our plates, that's when the guy at the front directed us to bring our plates outside to the public trash. I was so mad and thought about leaving everything there on the table. I felt pretty embarrassed that I had to do that and I'm certain that's not how the city wants them to dispose of their trash. I've gone back to places with worse food because they had good customer service.

Just as we were about to leave, a young lady arrived and opened the door - telling us that they didn't open until twelve o'clock.  We told her that we were aware of that and that it was now 11:58 AM.  We were told then that the kitchen didn't open until 12:30.  Lights were turned on and the six of us were seated.  No other customers arrived during the entire time we were there.  We left just before 2 PM.I ordered the Iraqi Kabob Platter and my wife chose Chicken Shawarma.  Mine was excellent - two lamb kabobs the length of the platter and two chicken kabobs of similar size.  Also included were two tomato halves and a split jalape√±o which had all been grilled.  This was all served on a bed of yellow rice.  The food I chose was delicious!  My wife's dish came with chicken on one third of the plate, rice on one third, and the Greek Salad (her choice among four offerings) was quite good.My meal was so large that I only ate only half of it.  Those who are less than my 76 might eat more.  We shared my leftovers for dinner last evening.Food was quite tasty.  There were no complaints from any of the six.  Service was close to non-existent.

I've always wanted to try this restaurant and now I wish I had made the drive earlier. Let me start off by saying, our server Hayley was so lovely. She was very attentive and carefully explained each dish to us in detail. I'm already looking forward to coming back.Their dinner menu was $45 for 3 courses. I chose the beef carpaccio for appetizer, the 7oz West Coast cut certified Angus beef striploin steak for my main course, and the baked Alaska for dessert. Every course was absolutely phenomenal.Before we were served our appetizers, we were given some sort of mushroom toast with raw egg yolk (twice, maybe it was a mistake). The name of the toast slips me but it was so delicious! Even their bread, served in a mini skillet and butter was so tasty. I don't think I've had better bread anywhere else. The only thing that stopped me from asking for a refill was knowing that the best was yet to come!The beef carpaccio was decorated with charcoal brioche, arugula, pickled shimeji mushroom and parmesan. The pickled shimeji mushroom really complimented the meat because it gave a sweet \\"kick\\" after each bite. I wish I had two servings of this dish.Next was the striploin steak served with warm potato salad and chimichurri. I am not the biggest fan of chimichurri but I think it was a great addition to the steak. I also could be wrong but I think there were hints of horseradish throughout. The steak was so, so juicy. Everytime I pressed my fork down to cut it with my knife, more steak juice would seep out. Yum. It was also perfectly cooked to my liking, medium rare just like the way I requested. Hayley kindly explained to us that they were most well known for steaks (and rightfully so) because they use a Josper oven, which brings out a smokey taste in all of their meat dishes (and basically whatever they make in that oven).For both of these courses we were offered fresh pepper which we said yes to. The pepper grinder was huge! Probably longer than my torso. I will also note here that I brought my dad, who usually isn't a fan of upscale dining but he loved tonight's experience as much as I did. The portions were so carefully created to perfection. We left feeling not too full but satisfied.We finished off dinner with their baked Alaska, which requires a minimum of two people ordering because of its sheer size. On the Dine Out menu, this choice is an extra $4 per person but I wanted to try it because of all the Instagram pictures I see of it. I found the baked Alaska to be quite sour (yet sweet) with the raspberry coconut ice cream with frozen raspberry, lemon sorbet and Italian meringue on top, but my favourite part of it was probably the orange vanilla cake. Very fragrant. Overall a beautiful presentation - Hayley even drizzled some caramel liqueur around the mountain before setting it ablaze. I wish it was possible to post videos to Yelp because the show was over before I snapped a picture!Finally - looking at the menu just now, I forgot to claim my glass of complimentary bubbles as advertised for Aeroplan members.

Our server until then was cheerful enough but poorly trained and knew next to nothing about the wine in general, or the selections on the wine list.  Which is kind of a big deal when it's a wine bar.  There was a decent range of reds, from Pinot to Tempranillo, but the cheese plate was rather skimpy on cheese.Robert, the owner, arrived just as we were finishing our wine and gave us a glimpse of how much better our experience had been if he had been there before, but by then, we had pretty much written the place off.\\nHopefully Pour can get it together in the future."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"In town on a business trip and came across this place by chance.

They offer a large variety of foods and is a great place for dim sum or for dinner. You really get to try your favorites and maybe something new to spice things up. Some plates are a huge hit like sweet and sour pork or the shrimp rice noodle/rolls and some are misses, like the soft shelled crab. Nothing that leaves a bad taste in your mouth though and everything is reliably good. The wait here can get a little crazy, but as the host recommended when I walked in with my family of 5, you should call to make reservations in advance.

The restaurant is really small -- about 10-12 tables. The bathroom is actually in the kitchen, and there's definitely no room to be standing around dilly dallying.Our server was...interesting.

Yes they have BBQ ribs and pull pork; as American as can be. However, when you start looking at the sides, that's where the magic begins. Black beans (Cuban), fried plantains (Puerto Rican), fried Yuca (Central American), pineapple (Hawaiian), Tofu (Chinese), Tortillas (Mexican), citrus peanut sauce (Himalayas), Lucky Dragon Sauce (Asian), Jasmine Rice (Thailand), just to mention a few. As you can see, dining there felt like we were at a Theme park enjoying \\"Around the World\\" dining. What was amazing about this lunch was that we did not have to pay for a \\"Park Pass\\" or park a mile away. We had a International experience all in four dishes; it was artificially magical I can't recommend any one dish because all four of the dishes we ordered were delicious!

I found this little gem on Yelp and we gave it a try.  The chicken tenders have a soft texture and light in flavor so the sauces do their job to add to the overall taste.  We specifically enjoyed the lemon pepper, chipotle ranch and Parmesan ranch sauces.  We tried honey mustard and others but they weren't as good.

Being that the restaurant is located in the often-cramped side of Winter Park, I was pleased to see that there is plenty of parking space (and a complimentary valet service to boot as well :)Just like most others have already Yelped, I ordered the Nashville hot chicken which is an excellent package with the mild spice kick on the skin, tender white meat, cornbread and mac & cheese on the side (didn't care for the white ranch sauce on the side). My only small complaint to this dish is that you're almost forced to get your hands dirty to gnaw all the meat off the bones, but that's what a provided table cloth and a clean supplied restroom are for. My companion ordered the fried catfish. The dish looked so good, I even took a small bite from it. Outstanding texture and very fresh.What I liked most from my firsthand dining experience was surprisingly the appetizer portion. We ordered half a dozen raw oysters and country ham plate. I forget where the oysters were originated, but boy, they were so fresh and yummy and even tasted better with the hot sauce provided. I could eat a few more plates of these bad boys and still have room for the main course; they were that good! The country ham plate was a nice meat complement dish; it includes three different slices of ham, jelly, mustard and homemade biscuits to make a small sandwich. It's not often you find this kind of dish offered as an appetizer but we were glad to choose and enjoy it.The server and overall service were amazing that Sunday night we went, we left a fairly generous tip even though the bill came out much less than I expected for a couple dining in at, say, a Ruth's Chris or Ocean Prime.

The portion was generous and to be shared.Our servers were prompt, polite and worked very efficiently on a busy night.  The tables were placed quite close to each other to the point where you can easily hear your neighbors' conversations.  I imagine this is not ideal for an intimate romantic dinner.

It was busy and we assumed it would take awhile for a server to notice us at one of the long communal tables. It did not. We quickly had menus and water.

They arrived, the meats laying on homemade mustard, a pile of bread and salted butter comes with it. Pickled onions and pickles. And queso blanco.Nothing one the board is meant to be eaten alone. Get some Boar and a little slice of pickle, then tear off a little bread. Or put dab of duck on the buttered bread with a little pickled onion. Every bite was an exploration of combinations and flavors. And then there is the Venison Hot Link Sausage. Which is the best, freshest, most juicy, sausage I have eaten in my many years on this planet. Wow. The only thing that disappointed, and it truly paled by comparison to the rest of the board, was the queso blanco. It is not bold enough to stand out with all the other flavors. It's the wimpy kid in the corner of the high school dance. And then there was Noah, who came to do his managerial duties and check in on different tables. His simple, \\"How was everything?\\" Was followed by us gushing about how great every element on the board was...he politely listened as we bent his ears and went on and on just like in this review. He answered our questions and gave us some backstory on some of the items. Then, inspired by our enthusiasm, he left and came back with something he was excited for us to try...Milk and Cookies. A Bengal Spice cookie and two same pours of Left Hand Milk Stout.

On one night, the beef stew was solid ($16) and the pressed chicken sandy was quite good ($11) while another visit with a Cubano ($11) was drenched in mustard and the steak + cheese sandwich ($13) was overly wet.It's my personal policy to avoid restaurants located in hotel lobbies. They are overpriced and usually mediocre. But when you're in town with no car, sometimes you have to take a chance out of necessity. I'd say they are a four star place for drinks even though you will at times have to get your own drinks from the bar. Earlier this year, I was in town for PAX East where audible grumbling from the wait staff was overheard more than once regarding their lack of tips. Gee... maybe if I didn't have to get my own beverage, I might tip more than 20% like I do back home? But if I'm reminded or you assume that I tip poorly based on my pop culture t-shirt and jeans, you're going to reap what you sow.Side note, one of my pet peeves was the fact that no one employed could translate the Gaeilge painted over the archway.

My boyfriend and I had a little transportation problem and arrived 10 minutes late, after getting lost, and freezing, the first words out of the hostess mouth was \\"Your reservation was 8:30. SORRY, but we gave your table up\\" in this tone that the situation was totally our fault and we should have known better. Isn't that why you get a telephone number when patrons make reservations?? So you can call and double check and confirm with them? And what an idiot to think that we wanted to here that after going out of our way to go there on VALENTINE'S DAY.THEN it took about 15 minutes to get our glasses filled with water. I purposely put my menu down and stared at every waiter/waitress that walked by wondering who was our neglectful waiter. He finally came and he apologized. I only feel a tinge of sympathy for him because it seemed like he was working half the room and covering the bar as well. But still! At this point, I was contemplating of making a small scene and leaving. They were just lucky that I was starving. The food though was maybe 3 or 4 stars? It was tasty. Perhaps the chefs were the only ones on top of their game that night. But I think I could definitely find great food elsewhere without the lack of service I experienced here.

Eat Me Speak Me is located in the back of Victory Sandwich Bar on Church Street.  You can either walk through Victory past the ping pong table to the back of the restaurant or enter through the alley next to the restaurant (also labeled as SOS Tiki Bar).  The speakeasy is dimly lit and was lively when I went for dinner at 8:30 PM.  On the Menu: The menu rotates and depends on the mood of the chef.  So just show up and be prepared for a surprise!   On the night I went, there was a soup, a few salads, a gnudi (cheese dumpling), a raw beef appetizer, a pork dish, a chicken dish, a peas and beef dish, a rice pudding, and a blondie +milk dessert.  Notably, you can order a combination of these by choosing the omakase.  My friend and I weren't that hungry so we shared a small set of the a la carte dishes instead. What I Tried:\\nTomato ($8) - Nope, this dish is not just a huge tomato.  It's a balanced salad with a mix of small red and green tomatoes, topped with greens and peanuts served in a cream sauce and a green puree.  It may sound exquisite for $8 - and it is.  All of the vegetables were fresh and the tomatoes were soft.  The seasoning and the sauce almost makes you forget that you're eating a salad.  And definitely finish all of the puree, it's really good too.Raw Beef ($10) - This was a bowl of diced beef tartare blended with diced vegetables, garnished with fresh basil, and accompanied with a squash puree.  You eat them with little corn chips.  Although I found this appetizer a little salty and wanted a little more vegetables and basil, it does beat eating nachos.  I preferred the tomato over the raw beef, but the raw beef isn't bad.Gnudi ($11) - Think a fancy plate of vegetables and dumplings (European style) for only $11.  Each of the little gnudi were bursting in flavor and again, finish all of the puree that is neatly laid out on your plate.  There was a nice assortment of leafy vegetables and squashes. I liked the squashes the most as their texture matched the gnudi but had a more subtle flavor.  I would definitely order the gnudi again.Blondie + Milk ($5) - Everyone's favorite peanut butter brownies, but with the creative touch of whiskey milk.  You're also given straws if you want to drink the rest of your whiskey milk.  Personally I think the blondies are best if you let them soak in the whiskey milk for a few minutes.  The blondies become softer and also absorb all of the flavor in the milk.  I also sipped some of the whiskey milk afterwards.  You can definitely taste the whiskey in there.Verdict: I loved the tomato, gnudi, and blondie with whiskey milk.  You get incredibly delicious dishes with presentation typically reserved for fancy restaurants at a very good price.  Also, both the atmosphere and the service is great.  Eat Me Speak Me gets an easy five star rating from me."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"As the fall leaves turn color and there becomes a slight nip in the air - this place is where one can find hearty soul filling Brazilian food.

Not only is the ice cream rich and creamy, but the flavor combinations are a work of food art. It takes serious talent and creativity to come up with combinations that work this well.This location was a surprise find as we were waiting in line for Pine State Biscuits since I had planned to return to the location in the Alphabet District. A sweet treat was in order after the savory biscuits. The inside of the shop was fairly small, but we visited at an off time and they weren't busy. I wouldn't visit this location planning to eat there since they only have a few stools and one bench. As soon as we entered we were greeted by friendly employees. They offered samples and were eager to have us try the flavors offered.The Taster seemed like a good way to try several flavors without a sugar overload. My husband was full and talked to me into sharing one sampler. It ended up being a good thing since the four scoops provide a decent amount of ice cream.The Stumptown Coffee & Burnside Bourbon was great. I loved the coffee taste with the bourbon and it created a rich flavor. Honey Lavender was also delicious. The honey balanced nicely with the lavender. The lavender was used nicely and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the ice cream. The Cinnamon Snickerdoodle was a nice combination and refreshing. Petunia's Coconut Mint Chip Whoopie Pie sounded great, but just didn't live up to my excitement. Something about the flavor tasted off to me. The other three flavors were winners.Salt & Straw also maintains their dedication to being a local Portland business. I like that they try to incorporate foods from other local businesses into their ice cream like Stumptown Coffee and Petunia's whoopie pie."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"The restaurant is conveniently situated in the middle of assembly row outlets.

We ended up splitting the fried chicken entree which was a total of 4 chicken pieces, 2 halves of street corn topped with aioli, and 2 biscuits. The chicken was incredibly dry and lacked the supposed spicy maple flavor. The street corn was fairly good, but the corn kernels were tiny and had no substance to them. The biscuits weren't too special either, I could've mistaken them for kfc or store-bought quality. We were happy with the service but hoped the food would be tastier.

The wrapper was a bit too thick, and really clumpy at the top.  The meat was flavourful and the broth was decent.  The ginger slices in the vinegar were a bit too thick, as I prefer a very thin julienne.  This was more of a rustic slice.  Also had the rice cakes with pickled veggies.  This was much blander than I would normally like.  It also didn't have that slightly burned smoky flavour that I normally love in this dish.  It also seemed that they put some corn starch into the wok to give a bit of a goopy sauce which reminded me of the sauces you get at Canadian Chinese restaurants a bit too much for my liking.

I love a good gourmet dog.  The article talked about the creators having aspirations of expanding to other sites within Portland, and eventually across the West Coast.  I don't think that will happen.It was stupid expensive.  When I go to Ringside I know I will drop too much money, but I know I will be wowed, my pallet will be impressed, and I will leave with a loosened belt.  For Clutch to charge $10 is pretty ludicrous.  The sausage has a great flavor, but is kinda dry, and very small.  All the fancy deconstructed toppings simply exist and don't seem to add anything to the \\"theme\\", and don't add much flavor.  We had a nacho dog and a cheeseburger dog, both of us agreed that it was fine, but the specialty toppings added nothing.  And even with the chips, we found ourselves snacking the remainder of the day because the dog was so small.  Seriously, to leave full you'd need 2, and that would be $20, no.Other reviewers complain about the white d√©cor, I thought it was fine.  They put a LOT of money into marketing, the logos are amazingly cute.  The music was good, 60's rock.  I would like to address the packaging however, your food comes out in very pretty boxes (again, great marketing) that will be just thrown away.  Nothing is recycled, cups, forks, pretty boxes, etc.  Only glass and cans.

I've been back on 2 other occasions, and I must update with a... \\"I TAKE IT ALL BACK\\" on what I said in the last few reviews. Yes, it's been like 2 years since my last review, so an update is warranted. The last time I was here was about a year ago, and most recent visit was this past weekend. I must disclose that I was here for industry night last year, so I can't particularly rate them on that scale since it is the industry and usually they try to make themselves \\"look\\" better and also make sure that everything is picture perfect. And it was... sort of... especially if most of your clientele is already in the industry with a night dedicated to it. But my most recent stint was not on any specific night, but a Friday night. So, they don't take reservations for lanes on the weekends. WHY NOT? But you do for the weekdays? Why would you need a reservation for the weekday?! Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a reservation if there's not many people going? *shakes head* Anyway, so it's an hour wait, I can live with that. We decide to play pool. No rack for the table - okay we share with a nearby table. Quality on tables are pretty poor condition and this is coming from someone who *ahem* SUCKS at pool! While playing, our pager goes off. It is now time to move to our lanes. Awesome. I do have to give your staff 2 thumbs up for great service. But that's pretty much where the story ends. We arrive on Lane 13. Yes, should have known, the number 13 would have been bad luck. Our server from the pool table helps us move everything over (food & drinks), assists us with closing our tabs and making sure everything is okay before she leaves us. Now before I even have a chance to put down my bowling balls, I get this guy on the next lane over telling me not to grab too many balls (yes you're allowed to giggle a bit here) because they've been getting stuck and that they have a lot of balls in there already. Grrrreat. Well I'm playing with these 2, suck it up! Not even a minute goes by and this maintenance guy is helping them reset their game, and eventually all these balls come flying out. Now... you'd think these guys would put some them away... oh no no no, they start using our balls eventually and now I'm sharing balls with these other girls and waiting and waiting for them damn things to return. Fine, I don't care much for your clientele and that's not your problem. But what IS your problem is the fact that my lane kept breaking down. Between resets, pins would fly out onto the lane and not actually reset. The brackets would get stuck when resetting. The game would freeze at some point. We had to call for help at least 5 times per game. We made to 2.5 games before we just started getting pissed and didn't even want to play anymore when the last time it just stopped working completely. Our last server advised that she was going to have them credit our last game since we couldn't even complete it, but I'm pretty sure we still paid for it. Whatever, I don't think I can ever come back here ever again. The experience just seems to get worse and worse each and every time. However, again, this is in no way a reflection of the staff because they are the only saving grace of this place at the moment and the only reason why they've even earned a star. The staff was super helpful and friendly and did everything they could in their power to try to appease their customer. But the facility is so run down, nothing can save this unless there is some sort of update/renovation in the lanes."},{"name":"Satu'li Canteen","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy, Ste E","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm not sure how I feel about the Satu'li.

I had visited the Kendall Sq. location before with coworkers and it was a pleasent experience. The same cannot be said about the Seaport location at all. Granted, it was a busy day for Lunch given the amount of offices in the Seaport area but that hardly makes an excuse for poor service. We were a party of 9, seated promptly despite the rush. Order was taken within 20 minutes of our arriving by the waiter whose name began with a D. I ordered a Pit Boss which has a choice of 3 meat items and 3 sides. I chose to get 2 Hot Links and Burnt Ends with Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese and Cornbread for sides. Our orders were repeated back to us, and all seemed good. Almost 35-40 min later, food comes out for our table. My order is not even close. I received 1 Hot Link, 1 Brisket, side of pickles. D was flagged down 5 minutes later and told that my order was incorrect. He tries to defend himself by saying 'I wrote your order down' and claimed that I had ordered brisket - well pal, you wrote it wrong. I ask to have this corrected and repeat my order. 10 minutes later and with my coworkers well into their meals, I get 2 Hot Links, 1 Brisket, Mac and Cheese, a side of pickles. I asked for BURNT ENDS not BRISKET. This is un-fucking-believeable. Given the length of time it is taking to get a turnaround on my order (10+ min) I ask to get my CORRECT order To-Go as I do not wish to keep my other coworkers waiting on me. Most of them were already nearly done with their meals at this point. 10 more minutes later, I receive a bag. I open the contents of each container to ensure that I get what I wanted. NOPE! 1 Hot Link, 1 Brisket, Side of Brussel Sprouts (????) and cornbread. Another 10 minutes later I am finally able to flag D down yet again telling him that this is wrong and I wish to cancel my order altogether cause this is over the top.Now this has been escalated to the manager on duty as he comes over claiming that he is going to 'make it right'. Nice effort on your part. I did get a To-Go bag with almost the correct order as I now have a Burnt Ends Sandwich (????) that I never asked for. My order was comped and I received a gift card for some unknown amount (for all I know it could be a total of $0, lmao). Unfortunately for you manager-san, this doesn't fix my terrible experience along with the cold and disgusting food I would have to begrudgingly ingest for my now extremely late lunch. A lunch that would come at the cost of having to bail out of helping one of my coworkers on our afternoon incident response shift just so I could eat. To avoid mansplaining and help assist with the end point, BBQ is intended to be consumed when it is still hot. Getting BBQ To-Go means that it is expected that the food ordered would be packed in containers that retain heat. All the food was packed in thin paper based products that let outside air in enmasse which then, given the outdoor temp on 12/11/2017 and my 15 minute walk back to the office - had cooled all the food down in the bag to freezing. We do not have any ovens in our office kitchen and microwaving BBQ is a terrible idea that would just make the end product worse. Given how bad things already were, I wasn't going to take my chances with re-heating.Pissed off and completely disheartened from my experience I am finally able to have lunch and oh, do I regret it.Meats:\\nHot Links - Supposed to be consumed hot hence HOT links. When they are cold, they are absolutely gross. This is something I usually enjoy quite a bit but not like this. Burnt Ends - I asked for Burnt Ends, not a Burnt Ends SANDWICH. These burnt ends were 80% gristle and fat. WHERE WAS THE MEAT? Cold AF.Sides:\\nCornbread - Tasteless and dry. The freezing cold made it worse.Collard greens - LOLOLOLOL you guys suck at this. There were tough inedible stalks and stems in the greens. Supposedly these are cooked with bacon but I didn't see any nor did I taste it. Also cold AF.Mac and Cheese - Called \\"Pimento Mac and Cheese\\" on the menu. There was a significant lack of Pimento (none in fact) and it tasted no better than day old, freezing kraft dinner. I didn't even enjoy my free lunch and quite frankly I have half a mind to throw out this gift card of an unknown amount because even at the price of FREE this shit was DISGUSTING. I threw out most of my lunch, really should have just passed it off on some homeless person and got something else altogether.I implore you, dear reader to not waste your time with this place and to visit http://www.blueribbonbbq.com/ instead where your order is right the first time and the food is properly hot."},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to gorge myself on crawfish and it was totally worth it.

The only one that wasn't excellent was the liver toast -- bread perfectly grilled, good generous shmear of spread, but spread really was liver and nothing else. It needed a hefty dose of herbs or spices or something to bring it into balance. Other than that, we chomped our way through everything and left very full and happy. All those other dishes were bold, spicy, and in many cases nicely smoky on top. (There seemed to be a lot of bacon being thrown around.)I did try one of their cocktails in addition to the beer, a mango-ish Tiki thing.

We'll skip that response. Just go and eat at Bistro Wagon Rouge (Red Wagon) a true French bistro and as good as anything this side of the 6th Arrondissement. Checkerboard floor, old photos on the walls, it's like the 50's stopped here. Look, there, at the corner table, it's Dominique Strauss-Kahn out with the hotel maid enjoying a Frisee Lardon, (or is that a frisky hard-on?) Or was that Roger Vadim and Bridget Bardot kanoodling in the corner? Peut-etre qui sait?  The bar has been raised. Think Zinc. Everything about this lovely small place is off the beaten path without any Carnival Cruisers, and no tourists unless they are lost. What tourist isn't? Or should be? B.W.R. is totally real, et totalement Francais. May we? The Staff: So, unParisian. Polite, helpful, pleasant, charming and willing. Everyone is involved to assist the mini -kitchen crank out top flight food. The Bar Program: Also small, but potent. (Sorta like Mickey Rooney. Just ask Ava Gardner.) An East Vanhattan qualified as a bolt upright grown-up libation. Bourbon, O. S. Bittersweet Vermouth, and a Cherry lookin' back at you. (Stay focused.) A crowd pleaser or crowd controller.The Bourbon Whiskey Sour with Lemon, Bitters and 100% Maple Syrup was a straight ahead, three chord rock and roller of a drink. Two of these and the server yells \\"Timber\\" and stands back.The Food. In one word...Onederful. The Croquette d'Escargot were a good start. Bite sized mini croquet balls of...well, escargot fried crunchy with a Nasca line design of Lemon Aioli. An ideal bar nibble. Go ahead, get a pair of these balls.       The Frisee Salade, Lardon, Poached Egg, Croutons, with Grainy Mustard Vinaigrette was as French as your first real kiss. Perfect. (Okay, maybe only the salad qualifies.) The egg yolk was as runny as a headless chicken. Wait a minute...it was a headless chicken.The Halibut and Clam Special of the night would be special any night. A light broth with a halibut raft. Now, halibut is not for amateur chefs. Blink and it's the tongue of a Reebok. This fish was spot on. Crispy skin, and moist flesh, (sounds like an ideal beach date). And it was surrounded by Pearl Onions, and just picked de-podded English Peas. Having a good pea is one of life's little underrated pleasures.  The Country Pate, does it make me look fat, eh? But, ooh baby, was it worth it. Two isosceles thick triangles of rustic unrefined course pork. (Unrefined and course can be fun at a bachelor party as well, but that's a different review.) It was a magic pate. Pat the chef on the back for getting so right along with the house pickled carrots and beets with a snap and tingling kick of measured spice. The Steak Frites was prepared correctly too. The beef actually tasted like it ate grass instead of dining on Prednisone twice a day. Steer clear of that. And let me take a moment to expound on the Mt. Logan of French Fries. I have eaten enough french fries if laid end to end would reach to the moon. (And I can still see my handsome toes without looking in the mirror or taking a selfie.) The fries were simply the very best this side of Bellwether in SoCal or anywhere else, for that matter. Triple fried, still crisp after the steak juices pooled through the pick up sticks maze of untouched fries. I was savoring and taking my French Fry time with them whether enjoying them neat or dipping them in the house made creamy thick mayo. Hey, let me hold your mayo. (A new food group is born.)The Dessert: A Lemon Tart. It was everything a lemon tart should and can be. Sweet and yet so tart it made me look like the grill of an Edsel.

I said something to my mom (I'm not sure if they heard me) and then so a different lady came to ask how we were doing. She was really nice.

Per the terms of the coupon, we had to order an appetizer or dessert plus a drink per person. We ordered beef tartare to start, two prime ribs, and creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. I had a cocktail and the boy had an old fashioned.The complimentary bread was warm and soft and a nice start to the meal. It came with blue cheese butter which I thought was a bold move because a lot of people don't like blue cheese! The beef tartare was nicely seasoned and tender. I especially liked the crispy puffed chips that complemented the soft and chewy beef. The prime rib dinner (only available on Sundays I think) included mashed potato and Yorkshire pudding. Everything on the plate tasted good and was really filling! It would have been nice for the plate to include some veggies though. The creme br√ªl√©e had a nice crisp top and creamy centre but I didn't see any real vanilla beans.

The buns are not especially fresh, the fries have more grease than potato. Zero menu options. The food is overpriced for essentially being back-yard burgers made on a huge grill. The only reason for any stars is because they pound out their own \\"never frozen\\" patties and apparently source potatoes from local farms (who the hell knows where the beef comes from...).

We were disappointed that the baked bread in the iron skillet with blue cheese butter didn't come out as our appetizer but arrived after our steak. Boy was it huge! I couldn't believe I ate every bite. Again, I can't reiterate that the pianist was so talented going from Aqua - Barbie girl to the Eagles - Hotel California with finesse and no hint of transition.

I was pleasantly surprised with the sausage as most places have only chicken, but also do come with a larger portion. \\n-Lean pork congee - this was the only item I wish we had not gotten, as the flavor itself was much watered down (literally felt like just water with rice consistency and relatively flavorless toppings, although there was a fair amount of toppings which provided different textures but not necessary elevating the dish). I had even tried mixing the bowl more, but could not draw out much flavor from this, which is a shame as Cantonese styled dim sum should specialize in Congee.Tips/Takeaways:\\n-1 credit card/table\\n-Order on a menu, not a cart, items are made on the spot and relatively quick\\n-Good for groups of 2-4 on average, but there are tables to accommodate larger groups. \\n-Cheap options\\n-Would dissuade from the Lean Pork Congee $3.75 menu item\\n-Would actively recommend the Sticky Rice, Turnip Cake, with neutral to active recommendation for the Pork Buns and Shrimp/Spinach dumpling, as those are largely person-specific items\\n-Would recommend return 1x / 5-7 months for Dim Sum either for lunch or for dinner"},{"name":"Ping","address":"102 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's good.

The fruit that was on the fruit danish was grey and I'm actually not even sure what kind of fruit it was. The spinach quiche was okay taste wise but it was cold and soggy. The cheese board was a joke. More bread than cheese and some random salami that tasted like it was made of 4 different horrible cuts of canned meat. And it was served with strawberry jam also in a plastic to go cup. The Bloody Mary had one olive and two limes for a garnish and was not served with a straw and was so spicy I only had a few sips before my lips were on fire. Had ONE bite of the veggie sausage and it was crazzzzy spicy with no warning. And finally the coffee was horribly bitter.

I ate at The Picnic House 3 weeks ago while in town to see friends, we had a big table (5 couples). We had a delightful, friendly, accommodating, attentive waitress (blondish hair, in a top bun). So I recommended to my girlfriends that we eat here Saturday night while in town for a Girls trip. We had a very different experience this time. We were greeted by a pretentious, awkward server who told us they were out of the ragu and the skirt steak (with a late reservation we understood that, but her delivery left something to be desired). I asked if they could possibly make the Salmon Nicoise salad that was not on the menu, but I had had a few weeks back. She said \\"no\\", quickly and curtly. Could you at least pretend to ask the kitchen if they could accommodate? (I've worked in restaurants, give me something to work with here!) The 3-piece option of the Fried Chicken was a small drumstick, wing and a little baby thigh, not a split breast, or any meat of substance. So get the 5 piece if you want to get enough to eat. Also, it's served weirdly on a slab of wood, so the potatoes are smeared on that, and then the mashed potatoes are used to hold the cup of corn to the slab of wood. It doesn't work, who wants to scrape their potatoes off wood.The burger and fries was also served on a wood slab, it was tasty, but the fries had been under a heat lamp for a while, not hot, not fresh, not worth it. The Salmon with coconut risotto was a crowd pleaser (we had 3 on the table and all agreed), the flavors were good, mild coconut and the salmon cooked perfectly. \\nWhich only brought me back to the dream I had of that Salmon Nicoise salad from last time, perfectly cooked (sweetly crusted) salmon, al dente green beans and lightly dressed.At some point she spoke to us in french while delivering our dessert, it was like we were being punk'd, she was just so strange.

Stopped by about 7, the bar was full, but not packed. Went to the bar for service, not sure if they have table service or not, but I like to order from the bar anyway. Got our drinks and went out on back patio. Great atmosphere, great beer, great time. 5 stars again.My last trip there and reason for review was lunch on the 4th. If you live/work in downtown Sanford and this isn't one of your lunch stops next week you are doing yourself a disservice. I had the beer cheese soup and roast beef sandwich. Both were excellent and will be going back for lunch or dinner soon. The menu is expanding and if the new items are close to what I had it will all be excellent. Service, beer, and food was all 5 stars. \\nCheck this place out!"},{"name":"Spider House Ballroom","address":"2906 Fruth St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great bar!!! Great drinks!!

Yeah, on a Wednesday! Crazy.Anyway, it was my friend's 23rd bday yesterday and so she, her boyfriend and myself headed to Highland Kitchen for a celebratory dinner. It was packed! We were told the wait would be a little over an hour, and thought about leaving to go somewhere else, but decided against it since my friend and I had already been planning what we were gonna order for about a week. (I know, we're dorks). So, we settled in at the bar and ordered some drinks. I tried the Mark and Stormy (Maker's Mark, chili infused ginger beer) and my friend got the Hanky Panky (gin, orange bitters...not sure what else lol). The Mark and Stormy wasn't what I was expecting... a little too spicy and heartburn-y.  Still I'm glad I gave it a try. Finally we were seated and proceeded to order. I got another drink- their special beer of the night- an IPA from San Francisco and it was delicious! My friend and her bf got the buffalo brussel sprouts appetizer and luckily I was able to steal one because they were amazing!!!! Like a mini cabbage covered in buffalo sauce. Wow that makes it sound gross actually but it was absolutely delicious. On to the entrees. I got the catfish po'boy which was perfectly cooked, covered in yummy sauce and served on fresh french bread. YUM. My friend ordered the spicy goat stew, and she was warned by our server that it was hot hot hot! I was able to steal a bite of that as well and it wasn't as hot as the waiter made it seem. It was yummy! I highly enjoyed my experience at Highland Kitchen last night- from the service to the drinks to the food.

Value: Worth every penny!

It is a bit hidden... could almost use a map to find it... the signs for the Elephant lounge, which is down stairs, are much more prevalent then signs for Swift's. But we found it. (Parking sucks but right around the corner is valet parking for only $10... way worth it!!)It is a dimly lit intimate space located down town. It has lots of character and ambiance from the second you walk in. It is not a huge space so I recommend a reservation before trotting on over to eat here.It is set up as a tapas type place... order a dish and share the food with the table. Exactly my kind of place! Smaller bites of lots of things so I can try a bunch.For my drink I had the Rye Not... and I'll tell you it is a boozy rye concoction that will have you saying Rye not have another! It was awesome!We started with a couple of aps... the Squid Fries and the bacon wrapped dates. The squid was tender and juicy in long thick strips. I've had bacon wrapped dates in other places that are better, these are a little small, and just ok.For our meals we had the Brussel Sprouts, the flank steak, the quail, the pork belly, and the pork cheeks. I have been experiencing truly good Brussel sprouts, one of my formally most hated foods, at some of my latest outings, however, I found these to be the best yet!! Ohhh my Goddie these are sooooo Hottie! I could of just had these for dinner they were soooooo very very good! Seriously these are OUTSTANDING! The flank steak cane out spicy and with a rice cake that is heavenly. The pork belly is a full flavor assault on your taste buds that will have you yielding over to ecstasy. While the pork cheeks are served with toast, fig jam, and a spicy mustard... note: go easy on the mustard or it will way over power every other flavor. The quail was the only disappointment... it was dry and really had little flavor... it was not bad just not up to par to the other fantastic selections... I would not order this again. The food was just about everything I had hoped it to be... My bday dinner was completed with a Mexican chocolate ice cream scoop nestled in between two waffle cookies and a bday candle.

The Halal Guys is a well known food truck from New York.  Despite being from New York, I have never tried it - so I finally decided to give it a shot now that there are a few locations in Atlanta.  The Halal Guys serves Middle Eastern food - choose from platters or sandwiches with chicken, gyro, or falafel.  Side include hummus, baba ganouj, fries, falafel, and baklava.  That's it.  It used to be a food truck, so there isn't a ten page menu here.  There's a medium sized indoor dining area that gets very full at lunchtime.Location/Parking: The Midtown location is located next to the Modera apartment complex and Momonoki - just west of Spring Street adjacent to I-75/I-85.  They validate parking if you park in the Modera parking structure.  Ordering Experience: Order your food at the counter, choose your toppings/sides, and pay at the cash register at the end of the line. The employees are business-minded here - they'll ask if you if you want everything with your entree, but keep in mind that everything is not included in the base price.  They're cool though, so you won't get an unfriendly experience.What I Tried:\\nRegular Combo Platter (Chicken + Gyro, $8.99) - The platter consists of rice, meat, a salad of iceberg lettuce and tomato, white sauce, red sauce, and pita bread.  I've heard several people say that the food doesn't meet their expectations here - and I'll admit it is different.  The white sauce is very different from you normally get at a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant.  It's mayonnaise based, not yogurt based, so it's richer and creamier.  The gyro meat is what you'd expect and is the more flavorful of the two meats.  I think the chicken is fine though with the right amount of white sauce.  There's a fine balance between your chicken not having enough flavor and being too full at the end of lunch, but it's achievable.  My pita bread was warm and soft, while some of my rice was undercooked.  I have to give them credit for making a hot sauce that is legitimately hot.  I'd recommend adding a medium sized dose to your platter or sandwich if you crave spice.  Portion size is great for what you pay for.Verdict: The chicken is tastier on its own at other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants.  The white sauce is creamier than what I'd usually have with Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food - closer to ranch dressing than tzatziki sauce.  Overall, the plate is a little greasy but I'd still give 3 1/2 stars rounded up to 4 - with respect to quantity, it's an excellent value for lunch."},{"name":"Schaller's Stube Sausage Bar","address":"600 West 6th","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Easily one of the best brats I had ever eaten.

The place is small, so you have to wait outside and have to trek down those steps again. They will not seat you until your entire party is there and more often than not, you'll have to share the table with other groups. They don't have carts being pushed around. Just mark up what you want and they bring out the food when it's cooked. But all the food tasted and looked like it came from a frozen package. So disappointing for such a long wait.

The toppings were fine.  And whoever said they only have american cheese is wrong: they have provolone, cheddar, american, and I don't remember what else.

It was very very disappointing. The lack of professionalism and good service was a big turn off. I could never recommended this to anyone especially to my family and friends.When we arrived, of course, we told them our reservation name. When this person asked us to be seated for a bit. We were waiting, it was getting quite warm since we were already inside. The host looked at me while I took of my coat --\\n1. did not offer for a coat check. We were offer the seat and still carrying our trenches and coats. Finally the manager came and ask if he could take it for coat check. Brushed it off.\\n2. Since most of us have not been here we asked for a suggestion \\"so what's your popular dishes?since most of us haven't been here, we would like to have some recommendations.\\" The server replied with a bit of a tone \\"everything is popular here. You can order anything.\\" I have been to a lot of restaurants, 5 stars even. And never I have ever heard something like that. I was expecting more of -- our seafood platter is most likely a good starter of anyones not allergic to seafood. It has a different variety of shrimp, mussels, etc. She didn't really tried to recommend any of the dishes. Again, brushed it off. Maybe she's new? Maybe everything is good. \\n3. Finally we ordered. Tbh for me alone, I eat a lot. And when I order something, I actually finish everything. Same as everyone. So as you may have guest we ordered quite a lot. Ordered their infamous hawkswoth steak -- as shown below. And started to order different steaks and other food. When our server said \\"you ordered a lot. I think you should just cancel (picked 3 items out) since you won't finish everything.\\" I got a little bit offended and said \\"it's okay we'll keep the (1 item)\\" as she fired back with \\"are you sure you're gonna finish it?\\" This was the time she was getting on my nerves. I told her if anything we could pack it up and take it to go. She also mentioned that it was not about the money, she was just worried that were ordering to much food. But as we reminded her again --- We could pack it to go. But thank you for the concern. \\n4. After that encounter, she then began giving this aura and attitude towards serving us. Little things that are very unprofessional. She didn't say excuse me when she handed a plate in our inner table -- mind you, we had a corner round table so her whole arm was literally an inch away from my face. And I'm speaking for my coworkers as well when she took our plates with food and did not even bother to ask if we were done or if she could take the plate. She did not have manners, no excuse me, no thank yous.\\n5. The manager came after her take down of \\"you can't finish the food\\" and said the same thing. So we repeated ourselves again and again to them. \\"I anything we could take it home. We'd rather order and taste the ones we want to taste.\\" And he sarcastically said..\\"Sure\\" and raised both his hands up. \\n6. The final and most offensive thing for us. We wanted to take a group photo. We decided that our background would be the wine wall they had. The manager then said with his exact words. \\"You want to take a photo here?\\" As he grin sarcastically. I said yes, it has a good lighting. He asked me again with a sarcastic tone \\"how would you know that?\\" I told him I do photography. And with the same tone \\"with that phone?\\" (Pointing at my iPhone). I asked if there was a problem with that. And he said he doesn't know about that and walked out. --mind you, he was supposed to take the photo.I finally rest my case. Went down to the conceirge and told them what happened.That night was supposed to be a carefree night. Enjoying the company of my colleagues, celebrating our holiday dinner.

This is an order at the counter then seat yourself style establishment. There is minimal inside seating but the venue has tables/chairs set up outside as well.I was hankering for their tacos as everyone seems to be raving about them. We decided on splitting one meal since we would be eating a full dinner in a few hours.We ordered the (#9) Mongolian Brisket Bento Box for $9.99. Unfortunately, Floyd's was out of the Mogolian Brisket. They were able to substitute with their smoked Brisket but there was a upcharge of $2 .The Bento Box came with Brisket, Jasmine rice w/Cuban black beans, noodle salad, vegetarian spring rolls and siracha sauce. The portion size was just right for one person. Sharing could leave you wanting if your hungy like I always am.The noodles were a Ramen style, slightly spicy and had good flavor. The vegetarian spring rolls were freshly cooked but really small and lacking. The rice and black beans were perfectly cooked and the portion size was generous. The smoked Brisket had a great smoke flavor and was very tender. However, it was a bit dry. We asked the staff for some BBQ sauce (as there isn't any on the tables) which they provided and this really made the Brisket flavor pop.We really liked the vibe and restaurant theme. The tables and bathrooms were clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.

First and foremost even the extra hot chicken not that spicy like Nashville chicken, it won't even qualify as medium spicy in Nashville.

His name is Eric. He calls me Dragon. It's this cute thing we have since that one night in Bangkok. The bartenders are way on their game. My manhattan was great. Not the best I've ever had, but very well done. They're also knowledgeable about the wine. The ol ball and chain ordered a Vino Nobile, and it was decent. I felt the need to order a Gr√ºner Veltleiner, and it was fabulous. The bar area is very old-school sexy. The Food:\\nCrispy Shrimp- I didn't think this would be terribly interesting, but I really enjoyed them. The flavor and texture combination was superbly done.Salt and Pepper Calamari- Well, this isn't really a traditional take on the dish, but I wasn't really expecting one from this \\"proto-fusion\\" type scene. They were fried perfectly, served with bits of jalapeno, carrot, and heart of palm, accompanied by a remoulade-style sauce and a Fish Sauce-style sauce. And they didn't need either, but it paired well both ways. Crabcake Sliders- These were the ex's favorites, and I was ready to jump at the idea of them. They were decent. Not thrilling. I'd have had something else on them, personally. Some remoulade, slaw...something. I think there was some avocado, but I mostly tasted bread (from the bun..not the crabcake) and some admittedly decent crabcakes.Ceviche: This was a winner as well. I can't remember it too well, since we were in the latter half of the two bottles of wine we ordered. The flavor was killer, though, and the texture of the seafood was lovely. All in all, I think we spent $90+ there. That's with two bottles of wine, a manhattan, and more food than we could stand.

It was recommended by our tour guide from Austin Brewery Tours. (On a side note I bumped into someone else later in the week that also recommended it when the discussion turned to beer.) I can see why this place is so highly recommended. Jester King is more of a destination brewery than a tasting room. It is tucked away in what appears to be a residential road. Their beer menu is diverse and I got the impression consistently changes. It has a large covered outdoor space(s) where you can sit and relax with a group of friends. I saw several groups of adults setting up under the patio what seemed to be birthday celebrations. It also has a outdoor restaurant attached to the patio. I had a pizza with Merlot jam. It was so good that I am looking for someone in the Northern VA area that does the same thing. If I had one complaint and it is somewhat minor is that on a wet and/or cold night (like when I visited) there really isn't an indoor space to sit. The space can still be enjoyed  (particularly after a couple of tastings) but it would have been nice to have a place to pop in and warm up. I also do not recommend Jester King if you and/or someone in your party has mobility issues. I loved the rustic feel of the brewery but the stone steps and bathroom in the Air Stream would make it difficult for someone on crutches and/or a wheelchair to move around.

Their chicken biscuits are EVEN BETTER! I usually get a bucket of chicken for myself. I tried a couple of the sides and the Mac and cheese is my least favorite (but hey, I'm only here for the FRIED CHICKEN). The hot sauce on the chicken is also delish. Price point is decent. But the quality in chicken is worth the $$. The chicken was fatty and overly oily like other places. It's cute little chicken shop inside of Ponce City Market. They have beer and other stuff.

With a group of 4, we ordered the bucket of fried chicken with a full rack of ribs, the Mac and cheese side, a biscuit, the gator tacos, deviled eggs, and crab toast. \\nThe highlight of the meal was definitely the crab toast and the biscuit. Fried chicken: The white meat pieces were pretty dry but my friends said the dark meat was decent. The chicken is fried pretty wellRibs: definitely had better. These were flavorful but not fall off the bone.Mac and cheese: decent, the cheese they use in this dish is similar to melted nacho cheese.Gator tacos: flavorful and fully stuffed. Recommend!Crab toast: it's 18 dollars but definitely worth it to try. Generous crab meat on top of Texas toast. Biscuit: my favorite of the night! Soft and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It comes with jam and butter. Use both! Overall, a decent place to dine.

But what I'd heard about Tasty & Sons, and a stroll past the menu the other night was enough to get my mouth watering.  Burmese pork stew and short rice with eggs two ways.  Lovingly made choco-donuts.  Family style (like big breakfast tapas) sounded fun.  The food comes when the kitchen squirts it out.  Dandy.  Love it, even.The choco-donut was good.  The texture would be better served not mixing the chocolate into the batter, but I was perfectly happy with it until the rest of the meal let me down.The French toast was downright mediocre.  Blah.  Texas toast fried with an egg gloss.  The bread simply lacked any character, and the egg didn't make up for it.  The syrup looked delicious, but was way too sweet.  Why hide the fresh blueberries, they could have been any berry.The Burmese pork stew had me excited.  Big hunks of pig glistening red with a fried egg over the top and some hard-boiled mixed in.  And it was so close to delicious.  But it was slathered in a too sweet, too salty glaze that made it taste like store-bought teriyaki.Alright.  So this review probably sounds worse than it really is.  I would and probably will go back to T&S.  I'm trying to express my disappointment from high expectations.

At first I decided to just walk down a few blocks til I found the one that had the most or most recent \\"Best of Boston\\" stickers. Found one with a lot, but the most recent sticker was from 2004, which means there was something newer and better out there. Eventually I just bought the bullet and went on Yelp. Great reviews, fresh made. Sold! Now to find Tyler St....Oh hey, its like 2 blocks up from the main gate. Sweet.The place is up a small flight of stairs and has a bunch of large circular tables and a few 4 person tables along the wall. As I was by myself, they asked if I mind sharing a table. Of course not! (It let's me peak at what other people are eating)  I went down the menu and proceeded to get a few staples. For the record I would have loved to have gotten more, but Dim Sum is still not the most efficient lunch when you're by yourself.-Clams in Black Bean Sauce. The small portion is $6.50 and comes with a great amount of clams. I don't know the etiquette, but once again I found myself fighting the urge to chuck down the broth.-Beef Ribs in Black Bean Sauce. Question I've always had: this is in Black Bean Sauce but is a completely different sauce from the one the Clams came in. So are there two black bean sauces? Anyways so long as you don't mind spitting out bones, great flavor.-Pork and Shrimp Dumpling. Standard; good flavor.-Chinese Sausage Bun. I love Chinese Sausage.-Deep Fried Pork Bun. Not as good as the mixed variety, but still enjoyable.-While I didn't get to go over the extensive menu, many of the items throughout the restaurant smelled and looked wonderful. The people at my table got the U-choy and I wanted to snag a piece.I handed off the menu to my friends who haven't found a good Dim Sum place in Chinatown. Hopefully this changes their mind.Also funny story - Only white guy in the place until a family of 3 walk in and sit down behind me. They are going over the menu and one of them says \\"I don't know what any of these items are.\\" The menu is in English, there is a picture menu, and there are standard Chinese fare. I guess they expected chop suey?"},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We found this place last time we were in Austin and have wanted to come back.

The redesign could use some better signage, because we stood in the new part for a few minutes before we went over to the other side and found the hostess there. We were seated quickly and service remained great throughout the meal. We got the carpaccio, the proscuitto wrapped pears and the artichokes for apps...the carpaccio was plated earlier in the day and refrigerated, which is not awesome, but the other two apps were outstanding! We were all using bread to mop up the gorgonzola sauce that came on the pear app. We ordered a mezze of the pumpkin raviolis which I thought were so great!! My husband got the lamb for his entree, the other couple got the veal and the pumpkin ravioli (they were that good!) and I got the filet for my entree. The food was all excellent. We skipped dessert but the menu certainly looked great. Oh, I almost forgot! I LOVE a good sidecar. It's my favorite cocktail. I ordered one, surprised to see it on the menu. It came on the rocks, in a rocks glass, and I think it was just Brandy and Cointreau, no lemon or simple syrup. Don't get me wrong, I drank it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Could be that that's their style, could be that the bartender didn't know how to make one...either way, other than that the meal was great!"},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"40 Cummings Park","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"this is a great ayce sushi restaurant where everything is made to order. the waiters are attentive and quick. the food is delicious and good quality. the food comes out at a fast pace despite everything being made to order. there is a very good selection for both lunch and dinner menus."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Overall, the food was just okay compared to other local southern food restaurants like Rosebud.

I've been eating at this place for at least 10yrs since I live right down the street. Not only are they cold, but you consistently have to ask for ketchup. This is always a mystery to me. Do fast food restaurants really save that much money by not including ketchup with every order of fries? I know not everyone wants ketchup, but I'm guessing the majority do.I will say that they are always fast and efficient, if not friendly. You never have to worry about a long drive-through wait, even if the line of cars is out into the street. Even with the longest line you can get your order in about 5 minutes.I'd prob give them 3 stars, but I'm so tired of their food I can't make myself do it."},{"name":"The North End at 4580","address":"4580 Broadway St, Ste D-1","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Great service and amazing food!

They have unlimited fountain drinks and they carry a wide variety of bottled drinks, sodas & juices. They have a dessert section. They make cakes, cookies, milk shakes, etc.The food is a bit pricey but the quality is excellent. Don't be surprised to see a line out the door during the lunch rush. If you're in a hurry, I suggest placing your order over the phone to avoid the line. You can pick up your food and sit at any of the tables they have available. Seating is first come first serve. They have an outdoor seating area that's great on sunny days. This place is busy so it's great for large parties & families. The staff is always great here.

We landed in Orlando on Monday around 5:45pm and were in search for a restaurant to satisfy our hunger.  As we drove the approximately 25 minutes from the International Airport to Pig Floyd's, I was thinking this place better be good enough to satisfy three tall volleyball girls and one hungry volleyball dad.  Pig Floyd's was a good choice except for one thing, which I'll explain in my review.Pig Floyd's sounds like an old school famous rock band, but with a meat connotation.  From the outside, it looks like a house that smells really good with that abundant barbeque aroma.  There are silhouettes of pigs on the outside of the building, inside, and even on their plates.  Inside, it's dark and has that hipster vibe.  As you enter through the front door, large framed menus are written on chalkboard.  The menu is rather simple.  Pig Floyd's is one of those order at the counter, get handed a number, and seat yourself places.  The girls and I chose to sit outside because unbelievably, the Orlando weather was very accommodating.The barbeque here at Pig Floyd's is quality personified.  It is deliciously yummy.  Order The Big Floyd and the specialty tacos.  The Big Floyd has oakwood smoked brisket, pulled pork, sausage, housemade sweet bbq sauce, citrus peanut slaw served on a toasted coconut pineapple roll and a side of fries.  My daughter and I also ordered a pork belly taco and a shrimp & sausage taco.  Both of these were scrumptious, finger licking, and inhale worthy.  My daughter and I made the mistake of sharing the Big Floyd and only ordering one taco each.  Both the Big Floyd and the tacos were so tasty, we regretted sharing.  If you're going to order The Big Floyd, heed my advice.  Be stingy and don't share.  Order more than one taco per person.  Really enjoyed the seasoned fries, but I wish it came with more.  It's so good that it should be unlimited refills.  Lastly, I ordered their sweet tea and after my first sip, I was glad to be in the South once again.  They do sweet tea right in these parts.I get to check off one of the restaurants on my Orlando foodie list and trust me when I say that you need to add this place to your own list.  I marked Pig Floyd's down one star because there should be an asterisk stating that The Big Floyd, the pork belly and shrimp/sausage tacos, and the fries should not be shared.  Pig Floyd, Rock On, or should I say, Cook On."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"150 Canal St","city":"Salem","stars":"2","text":"Went to McDonalds to get a quick breakfast, but there was nothing quick about this breakfast!

The place is not much to look at but they sure make GREAT pizza."},{"name":"JJ's Country Cooking","address":"1127 Moreland Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Southern food with a bent on soul style cooking.  They are open for breakfast as well.  A typical meat n three frequented by nearby state government/military personnel.  Prices here are bargain basement cheap, with a meat and two sides, cornbread, and drink for $6 even.  Entree choices include fried/baked chicken, cube steak, pork chops, and tips.  Ox-tails cost extra as usual.  Sides include mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, green beans, yams...etc.  When you pay, they give you a cup to a self-serve tea/lemonade station, soda fountain also available.  Overall a great deal and a filling lunch.  Food quality is pretty good, though I could tell ingredients are on the bottom end of the quality spectrum; you do get what you pay for, and for what you pay for...the food is very good.  For slightly higher prices, K&K Soul Food in Bankhead serves better food.  However, if you are looking for the best quality soul food, go to Busy Bee's.  Service is friendly and cafeteria style; the line moves fast.

We came on an early Friday morning and we were pleasantly surprised that the wait was under 15 minutes (yayyyy). As our first brunch in Portland, I can honestly say that the standards have been set quite high after this experience! We ordered a small (polenta and sausage ragu over an easy egg) and large plate (Burmese red pork stew) washed down with  a dockside bloody mary (gin, kummel, tomato, old bay, and a large shrimp). SO DELICIOUS! Even though the ragu was technically a small plate, it was incredibly filling. Every bite of the ragu was delicious with creamy polenta, melty mozzarella, and flavorful chunks of sausage topped with an egg. The Burmese red pork stew was also very tasty dish with large portions of tender meat, rice, and egg. Even though we were incredibly stuffed, we couldn't pass on dessert and shared a chocolate potato doughnut. We had to wait for a bit for the doughnut to be made, it was definitely worth the wait (plus extra time to digest!). The doughnut was cakey with a creme anglaise for dipping.Overall, Tasty n Sons is absolutely worth checking out. The food and the customer service are out of this world. But it's also a very popular place so if you can, try going early.

The tenders are not your standard heavily flour breaded tenders, they have a light coating of panko and are pounded out. Different but I love them! They taste fresh and are a good ratio of chicken to breading. My favorite sauces (so far) are the curry mayo (SO good!), buttermilk ranch, chipotle ranch, and habanero. I have tried several other sauces too and they were all good; the only one I didn't like was bleu cheese. There is also a \\"sauce slinger\\" walking around the restaurant with some of the traditional popular sauces for anyone to try. And their fried pickle chips are out of this world - probably my favorite fried pickles anywhere. The coating is garlicky with a little spicy kick, and perfectly pairs with the buttermilk ranch it comes with. They also give you a lot for only $2.99. I'm an annual passholder and now every time I go to the parks I have to make a stop at Disney Springs just to get my Chicken Guy fix."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"7608 University Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite, the original store, to eat at.

I support this because they use real metal spoons for samples, so there is not much wasted from letting people taste so many options.One thing that is really great about Salt & Straw is that they have monthly seasonal flavors. I tried their Thanksgiving flavors and they made me week at the knees. Our group of four all ended up choosing different flavors. Everyone found something unique that met their needs.They seems to usually have a GF/DF option, but make sure to call ahead or look at the menu to make sure they have a GF/DF option for you, because waiting in a line to find not GF/DF option would be a huge bummer.I would gladly go back here again.

I wanted it to be great, but it was just alright.  The pros are they have a good beer selection and the fries were pretty good, but you don't go to a restaurant just for the fries or if you do, you probably shouldn't.  They had a beer sampler where you can choose 4 5 oz draft beers for $6 and on Wednesday's you can get a beer and fish and chips for $5, which seems like a good deal (but I can't comment on the size of the fish and chips or if they are Van De Kamps)I had the walleye, which was pretty bland and flavorless.  They best part was this strange rice cake thing that came with it.  My wife had the BLTC, which was supposed to come on sourdough bread.  We question whether it was sourdough bread or fat white bread.  The bacon was fattier than Kirstie Alley's upper thigh and was greasier than a Twilight fan's face.  The atmosphere was pretty nice.  You aren't crammed next to someone like Rusty Bucket or Old Bag of Nails and everything was pretty new.  Also, they do have a nice patio.   If you want to get some drinks and don't care about the food, this place wouldn't be that bad.I may go back for a $5 fish and chips and beer day because hey, that's cheap.  Hopefully it's better because it did seem like a nice place to hang out and grab a few beers.PS If you do want amazing Walleye, go to Oscar's in Dublin.  You can send me a thank you card later.

We had the buffalo chicken meatballs which were okay and the olive plate which was just a plate of mediocre olives swimming in tasteless oil.  Of the dishes at the table nobody had a really good meal.  It was a mix of okay and bad.  The worst of the bunch was the Eggplant Paradiso (Eggplant Parmesan variation), that any chain Italian restaurant could outperform.  The Chicken Bosciola, (chicken with mushrooms and pasta in a wine sauce) was also quite bad.  Most plates went back half full and when the waitress asked if anyone wanted the rest wrapped up it was a chorus of no's.  This is usually a good signal for the server to recognize that the meals were not good.  She had never come back to ask so that would have been her only way to know.  The service was also quite poor.  Our waitress disappeared for long periods of time and our glasses stayed empty.  The highlight was definitely the band that went on around 9 PM.

I do enjoy their take on bbq. The actual place itself is relatively new, has both individual tables to sit and community style seating. Usually I go in thru their To-Go door and take the food home. The place is almost always busy, and I just prefer to eat the food in the comfort on my own home. The to-go orders usually take between 5-10 minutes from the time I order until my food is ready. As for the food itself, I would say 80% of the time the food is great. The burnt ends (nice toasty pieces of brisket) are phenomenal. I am also partial to their pulled pork. When I order the dinner plate of pulled pork, the portion size is generous enough for me to eat half for dinner and the other half the next day. The sweet potato casserole is good, although I wish they would add more nuts into their recipe. The mac n cheese is also extremely creamy (which is how I feel mac n cheese should be). The southern green beans are hit and miss. Sometimes they lack seasoning in my opinion. The biscuits, when done right, are amazing, buttery and flaky. I have had them when they must not have been freshly baked, and were hard and crumbly.  And the prices are not bad if you stick with the basics.
