It was also the only place where peppers included red and yellow peppers; rather than just the regular cheap green ones.  The highlight of the pie for me was the tomato sauce with its rich creamy garlic undertones perfectly seasoned with herbs and spices.

For the record, they'd opened for the first time on Monday, so I'll say this review is based on a \\"soft opening.\\"  \\n\\nI sat at the bar for about 20 minutes without anyone acknowledging me or offering me anything to drink.  It was as if I wasn't there.  This was a surprise considering that there were at least 9 people walking around with TDH t-shirts on, but only three were working (the bartender, a female server, and a male server bringing food from the kitchen.)  When it was brought to the attention of three separate people, they all said I'm sorry and how can I help you, but I never got a drink or the chance to order.  The bartender said she was going to make me a drink and then disappeared.  I'm sure she was working the tables, but she wasn't doing anything for me so...\\n\\nOne of the people offered me a taste of the red sangria.  My girlfriend said she preferred it over the peach because the peach was really sweet.  I figure the peach must have been diabetic-coma-inducing because the red sangria seemed to be super-sweetened red Kool-aid with wine tossed in.  And there was no fruit in it.  I'm a sangria snob since a visit to Spain, so this drink wasn't going to make it in the first place;  I tried to warn him that I wasn't a wine drinker but he was confident in this over-sweetened concoction.  \\n\\nAlthough I didn't get to order my own food, my friend let me have a taste of her chicken sausage.  The sausage had great spice to it and the casing was barely noticeable, but the sausage was crumbly and grainy in texture.  My friend had the crab legs and she said they were okay.  That was my limit to the food experience.  \\n\\nThere is an outdoor seating area upstairs, but I didn't get to see it because a private party was being held there.  The downstairs area is very pretty - lots of dark wood which I love, but the tables and accompanying chairs were a little cheap, something you'd expect to see at bingo night.  \\n\\nI got lucky with my parking in that there was a small space available in the 8 or so spaces to the right of the building that are allocated to TDH.  If one of those is not available, be prepared to pay $5 to park at Museum bar.  Someone mentioned that the parking lot for 626 Sports Bar can be used, but I didn't confirm this so definitely ask.  You don't want to park on the street around here unless you have a car you don't care about at all.  \\n\\nI ended up leaving after being there for about 40-45 minutes.  I was hungry and I could see that I wasn't going to get any food any time soon.  Someone brought it to the attention of the owner that I was leaving because I hadn't gotten any service, and he could have cared less.

Whenever a takeout place opens in the North End, I want nothing more than to give them my money, probably multiple times per week. However, it will be awhile before I give this place another try. My first order was awesome and I was really happy with it. I had the veggie burger with the seasoned fries. They wrapped the fries in foil--GENIUS. They stayed perfectly hot and crisp. \\n\\nThe next 2 times I ordered I was really disappointed. I felt as though whoever was on the grill didn't care how the food came out. The juicy lucy, which I had tried previously (and liked) was smothered in so much mustard that I couldn't taste anything else, my \\"medium\\" burger was seriously overcooked and the burger was way to small for the bun. What was even more of a let down were the fries. They put hot fries in a plastic to go container...no foil. What happens to fried foods when they are immediately placed in an airtight container? They get wet and soggy from all the condensation. Cobblestone clearly had the right answer, they just didn't execute. \\n\\nThe last (and final for now) time I attempted take out was when I ordered the 227 burger. When my bf got there, they told him they forgot to put in the order, but hey, I didn't care...I wasn't the one who had to wait! The burger sounded tasty, but was shaped in such a way that it was really thick on one end and flat on another. The result was a half medium, half completely overcooked burger. Again the toppings, although they sounded great were so messy and didn't make up for the lackluster patty. Same soggy fries. \\n\\nI hope this place finds good cooks who put out food that is consistent. Or at least they train cooks to PUT FOIL AROUND THE FRIES and make sure every burger comes out as the owner intended them to. I will try this place in another couple of months, and I hope they turn it around because I so want to give them money, a better review and customers that I send their way. \\nYour move Cobblestone!"},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"We really enjoyed this casual Asian eatery.

Has a nice easy store front sign that you can see with big open windows to look into. Parking is not too bad. Lots of street parking, though it fills up fast, but there is lots a few blocks away from the place that has a pay and show system were you can buy 2 hours of time for only $2! and then you just leave your ticket on the dash. Easy.\\n\\nFirst impressions/Decor:\\nWalking in it felt just like what this place said it was about, a diner that happens to be Vegan food. I walked in and felt I was back in the 1950s with a slight modern twist. Very cozy, and comforting with all the staff waiting to greet my girlfriend and I at the door. I cant say much other then I felt nothing but good vibes all the way to our seat. Didnt feel like a hole in the wall at all.\\n\\nMenu: \\nI opened the menu to this colorful array of choices placed about nicely on the menu. They had everything from Breakfast to dinner to dessert. The menu was small and simple. Not overwhelming at all. Just enough options for each meal of the day. They also have floats, frappes and other fun 50s style soda fountain drinks (all vegan of course). They do also serve a small selection of New England Beer, Wine and other drinks for people over 21.\\n\\nTaste (main course):\\nI decided to get the \\"Beer battered house smoked tofu\\" meal which was basically mock fish & chips. It came looking nicely just like fish & chips with the two big pieces of tofu laying on top of a bed of red cabbage slaw accompanied by black pepper fries(seasoned with parsley and rosemary) and caper/dill aioli. I took one bite and I died and went to heaven. The tofu had that deep fried fish feel without a fishy taste though. Nice crack to the batter which was nice. The fries were cooked perfectly! Smooth potato on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The slaw had a slight Caraway Seed taste I believe? It was fresh, crunchy and light. My girlfriend got the \\"Seitan loaf\\" which was mock meatloaf. It too was amazing. Taste and felt like real meatloaf that had cream mashed potatoes and garlic flavored rainbow chard. Everything tasted and looked like what you would get a 50s diner. They  did an amazing job at nailing down their brand and flavors. \\n\\nTaste (Dessert/Other):\\nWe also shared a \\"Brown Cow\\" which is basically cola with coconut ice cream and choco syrup. I then go my own piece of their \\"Coconut Citrus Cake\\" which had the most intense citrus flavor I have ever had. She got the pie of the day which was \\"Banana Coconut Cream Pie\\". Again. Amazing. \\n\\nPrice:\\nOverall not a bad night. One Float, two entrees and two desserts cost about $40. Yes a bit a higher then a typical non vegan diner but the price comes in the quality. Not only is the food prepared very very well but the ingredients are very very fresh and everything is homemade (even the the katsup). Meals average about $10 to $12, breakfast being cheaper. Floats and desserts about $5 each. If your vegan or into this style of food, its well worth the price. You are paying for the quality and still getting a HUGE quantity.\\n\\nService:\\nOur service was good. Our waitress wasn't exactly conversational, but she wasn't a jerk either. I was fine with her. She did her job well and did it simply. She knew the menu and way around the place.\\n\\nOverall:\\nThis place I give a 5 out of 5 because of quality, portions and price. This is just one of the amazing places on the small list of vegan places we have in Boston and for me its right at the top. I will absolutely be going back and I give my kudos to the chef and hard working staff.\\n\\n\\n-Anthony"},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"A friend and I sat at the bar around 9 PM on a Friday night.

The one who had the birthday decided he wanted pizza on this occasion.  Since the popular pizza place in town wouldn't take his reservation a discussion was had about where else we might procure a good slice of pizza in town.  That discussion led to the decision to go to Al Forno Ferruzza in the mythical land known as Alberta.  Here is where we pick up our story.\\n\\nOf the 5 people that entered the hallowed doors of Al Forno Ferruzza, only 4 of them were going to eat pizza.  A question was posed.  Actually 2 questions were posed.  What pie would we like and what size should we order?  The birthday boy was given the task to answer these questions and others that shall not be mentioned.  The first answer was decided.  The Puttanesca pie would be the one we would sink out teeth into.  The server came over and was asked what size she thought would be fitting for 4 hungry people.  She suggested the family size.  We said fine and she was off.\\n\\nAfter many minutes of waiting our pie arrived at our table steaming with a warming warmth of goodness.  I have no idea what I am typing.  Bare with me.  After all was said and done we each had 2 slices.  The pie was very good.  Not a NY pie, but something more resembling what you might get in Italy although I've never been.  Since we were hungry we decided we should get another pie.  The Margherita was chosen and another family pie arrived at our table within 15 minutes.  This pie is a simple one.  I like my pizza simple.  Therefore I liked this one.  Nice char on the crust.\\n\\nThis review has lost some steam.  Al Forno Ferruzza makes a good pie.  Simple as that.  I thought I was going somewhere with the first few paragraphs, but I lost wherever I was going and can't seem to find my way back.

I didn't see it until I wondered what was in my \\"Other\\" box, and...what on earth? \\n\\nI'm pretty sure all I did to warrant such a foul-mouthed, incredibly crude *pair* of tirades sent straight to Facebook's equivalent of a Spam box was point out that she'd worked with Texas Monthly before (true, and even though her photos looked fine to me, now I wouldn't hire her to photograph a pile of dog poo) and that she was charging too much for inconsistent 'Q (opinion, and if that causes you to lash out at random customers, well, you won't get my business). \\n\\nI don't even know John aside from liking his food. I've even been careful to avoid that little family fight in anything I've written because it's none of my business and as a mere consumer of delicious meatstuffs, all I really care about is the food. Keep your family drama out of my ribs, yo. \\n\\nI was even thinking of giving La Barbecue another shot recently. I'd heard that the pitmaster had gone further away from John's style and more into his own. Good for him. IMHO. That's a much-needed change if he can't consistently pull John's style off well. Do what you do well and *then* it might be worth the price--but maybe find a different owner to back it. Looks to me like this one flies off the handle at some really small stuff--at customers, no less. YOUR customers. \\n\\nSadly, though, I won't give my business to someone who can't take a little criticism. Criticism should spur much-needed improvement, not disgusting rants aimed at random customers. If you can't take the heat, get out of the restaurant business. \\n\\nFoul-mouthed pair of *tirades* are here if you're interested, but be forewarned--it's got NSFW language and the most misogynistic tripe I've ever heard from another woman: http://i.imgur.com/kiIOQEn.png\\n\\nI won't waste my time giving her a call since everything I've said has been attached to my real name, anyway, and I have better things to do than be belittled by a business owner I don't even know. \\n\\nOh, and a useful tip--don't send things out over the internet that you don't want reposted.

Reading comprehension, how does it work? \\n\\nYep--I posted this to ShaggyBevo. No, I can't excuse some of the comments there, but aside from the rough edges--they know their food, and most of all, they could spot if that phone number was for real or if someone was playing a bad joke. Whoops, it's a real one!\\n\\nStill, that doesn't merit the kind of misogynistic response I got. It's incredibly telling how people respond to criticism, and if they can't do it without resorting to vile, sexist  remarks, they don't deserve anyone's business. \\n\\nMy male friends generally don't have to worry about being accused of having opinions only because they slept with someone (untrue) or because their daddy paid for something (also untrue).

My husband gets the beer and he is okay with the list.\\n\\nThe service is ok  I went this weekend for brunch with a friend and the server took our order and came back when we needed more time.

And a waffle is a waffle, right? How can you mess up a waffle?   Not sure.  So since I didn't taste it I will take her word for it that it was good.\\n\\nI got the traditional eggs benedict. It was good.  The eggs were poached but a little too done - it was more soft to medium poached than the nice gooey runny yolk that I usually expect.  It came with a side salad which was quite good. The vinaigrette was a nice addition to offset the richness of the hollandaise.  I also substituted out the fries with the tator tots!  Yumm!  My fave!  The perfect food! No one place has tator tots;.\\n\\nI also ordered the spicy bloody mary. It was good. a little too much chili-tasting but it did come with a slice of bacon which was unexpected.

I had always heard it was a must and I'm glad we did. Granted we went on a Sunday for brunch and had to wait about an hour but it was well worth it. I'm a sucker for good sweet tea and their tea topped the charts. We ordered fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and they were fried to a perfect crisp and came served with a somewhat spicy, thousand island looking sauce. I ordered the Midnight Train (original chicken and waffles) I wanted to see what the hype was about; success. My chicken was cooked well and it was the perfect amount of crispiness. The waffle covered my entire plate. The waffles are soft and come out fresh as can be served with warm syrup, that alone got them points in my book. Nobody likes cold syrup on a warm waffle. Our waitress and all the staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Right after Christmas this past year I took my boyfriend who had never been before. He enjoyed it as much as I did. The second time around the food was just as great, the tea was just as sweet, and the staff was just as friendly.

Parking is not always easy on NW 21st, and the restaurant is down a few steps almost below street level.  But don't let that keep you from trying this place out.  There is nothing \\"spare\\" about the spare ribs--there's more meat on one of these honkers than on a half slab elsewhere and the flavor is stepped with applewood, fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked with a wonderful dry rub.  I got the combo plate--tried the spare ribs, the chicken and the lamb ribs with sides of cole slaw and their greens.  I didn't care for the lamb, not because it wasn't cooked perfectly, just found it too strong a taste for me personally.  The chicken was juicy/tender and delicious, not like the dried up chicken I've often got from being over cooked and then just re-heated at other places.  Their 4 sauces they offer are all wonderful.  The cole slaw was creamy and good as well as good sized.  The greens are definitely different--very vinegary, with pieces of bacon and smoky flavor.  But hands down, the spare   ribs were the best I've had anywhere in the area.  Sorry that poor ToniAnn didn't like it, and yes, the service does take a long time, I will admit, and I was the only one in the place having lunch.  But once I started eating, none of it mattered.

Below are the reasons. \\n\\nThis is like the only deli available in downtown Boulder. Standard sandwiches, great chicken salad, overall a solid place to grab a sandwich, soup or salad. The issue I have is with the level of efficiency. It takes probably 15-20 minutes for them to construct your sandwich, isn't the whole point of a deli a quick and efficient meal? Part of the reason why they're so inefficient is because they have each person handle an order as opposed to working like an assembly line. You've got multiple people running all over the place to get the meat, condiments, etc, I'm surprised they still haven't implemented the technique. The other part is, more than half the people ordering sandwiches ask for to go but you've got no room to stand to wait for your sandwiches. Can't stand in front of the Haagen Daaz ice cream counter or they yell at you, even if there are 0 customers interested in indulging in a cone. \\n\\nI think they need some reworking when it comes to logistics.

The Peached Tortilla has paired with Star Bar on weekends to offer much better seating than competitors (and warmth in the winter on Star Bar's covered, heated patio).\\n\\nTo get a taste of what the Peached Tortilla had to offer, I tried a variety of their menu items, which were affordably priced. I started with something basic--the bbq brisket slider, which was hearty enough and uniquely paired with a jalepeno flavored slaw. After that I went for a crabcake slider, which is every bit as delicious as previous posters have stated and the vastly underrated chicken satay tacos. Everything was so tasty that it was hard to choose a favorite until Eric, the owner, insisted that I try the banh mi slider. Admittedly, I was hesitant to eat something made with pork belly, since I'm usually turned off by the fat. However, the crunch of the pickled daikon and carrot salad and the tangy sweetness of the sriracha mayo combined so well with the braised meat that my mind forgot that it was pork belly and my body forgot how incredibly full I already was after 3 sizeable menu items! I may change my mind after having another crabcake slider, but I'm going to temporarily award the prize of best dish to the banh mi slider.\\n\\nThe Peached Tortilla is worth a visit...or several.

Both were creamy and perfectly cooked with great flavors.\\n\\nMeatballs:  Damn solid...with the right amount of cheese to keep them interesting.\\n\\nWe also had an order of shrimp scampi.  Nicely done.  Not a dish I'd usually order, but you have to be nice to your visitors right?\\n\\nWine list is quite decent with wines nicely sorted by price point.  A tasty super-tuscan for only 30!?\\n\\nNo deserts are served, but its the north end.

I heard so many people say it was fantastic that I had to check it out. I ordered the dinner special with Ribs and Steak Tips. Both were delicious and the meat truly did fall off the bone, which is what they are known for. The portions were large so I was able to save half and enjoy the rest later. The only downside was that I ordered my food to go and the girl taking my order seemed very rushed. She barely stopped to look at me and when I got back to my hotel I realized that the sides I received where not what I ordered. She had walked by, quickly handed me my food, and then walked off without bothering to check if it was correct or if I needed anything else.  I normally check my order before walking away but I was pressed for time, and since there was no one at the to-go counter to help I chose to roll the dice and see what I got when I returned to the hotel. Besides that, I have to commend the hostess because was truly friendly and was open to suggesting which items off the menu which she thought I may enjoy as a first time customer."},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Hops N Scotch several times since it first opened.  I had been eagerly anticipating its opening.  Coolidge Corner really lacked a good beer bar.  \\n\\nThis afternoon I went for the soft opening for brunch.  Another brunch spot in Coolidge Corner will be a big plus.  This was their first go at brunch, and it was very promising.  As with all soft openings, there were some kinks that need to be worked out, but overall, we enjoyed our meal very much.  Between us we had the chicken and waffles and the hangover hash.  Both were very good.  \\n\\nWe have eaten here for dinner several times.  We have never been disappointed, and some of the things they do - the Scotch eggs, the cheesy grits, scallops, etc. - are very good.  \\n\\nThe beer selection is very good - lots of variety and no BMC offerings.  The primary drawback is that their beer menus are not updated frequently enough - often the taps don't match up with the paper menus.\\n\\nThe staff is generally very friendly and helpful.  We had an issue with a waiter being inattentive on one of our first visits, but have not had that problem since, and I have not see the waiter working there since that visit.\\n\\nThe place has a tendency to get crowded.  Things seem to have settled down since the crush of people when it first opened.  Given what Hops N Scotch offers and the relative lack of alternatives in Coolidge Corner, this place is likely to remain popular.  If you are pinched for time, you might want to call ahead and check to see what the wait is like.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this place.  It has become my new regular.  The owners are great and are doing a good job of being attentive to their clientele.  They have made great strides since they first opened, and I hope that this place continues to grow and becomes a mainstay in Coolidge Corner."},{"name":"Latin Quarter","address":"Universal Studios Escape, 1000 Universal Studios Plaza","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"3.5 stars...\\n\\nWe were on vacation visiting Mr. Potter and his little wizard friends and stayed on one of the on site resorts. Seeing as we did not rent a car, we decided to explore City Walk and check out the restaurants here.\\n\\nWe went to the concierge and he suggested this Dinner and a Movie deal for $21.95 per person. The movie alone costs $11, so we thought, why not? We headed out early around 6:30 and were seated right away with no reservations. The menu for the deal is limited but you can always add things from the regular menu if you choose.\\n\\nWe ordered the Arroz con Pollo which was a very huge portion with tender chicken cooked with the yellow rice, very flavorful. Another dish was a special I think, coconut talapia with a mango cream sauce, it was just ok, the coconut worked very well with the fish and mango cream sauce, but too rich to have the whole dish at once, the rice under it was undercooked and too hard it kind of stuck to my teeth as i chewed...\\n\\nOverall it was enjoyable - even the cheesy Latino music videos playing on a projector over one of the walls."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The ambiance and decor of this place is great.

The night was.. A bit of a struggle. I'll start with the bad stuff first then move on to the good stuff. (scroll to the bottom of you just want the straight recap)\\n\\nThe wait times we had were really really long. Granted, the wait time for the waitress to take our orders was 100% on us, because we had 2 people who came pretty late last our reserved time. Apologized for that but our waitress seemed very nice about it. But otherwise everything took super long it just dragged on. The time it took to get our drinks, then to get our meals, then to get our bill. The waitress was very polite and informed us that the kitchen was running a little slow, but nothing terrible. So we all appreciated her fair warning! Although, definitely felt terrible. Even with great company and the opportunity to have multiple conversations, we still could feel the lull. By the time we were all done with our meal, the wait for the check really felt a little ridiculous. At that time we seemed to be one of 3 parties left in the restaurant. We asked a man filling our waters if we could get the check when they got the chance and he was very short with us. And to be fair, he was not our server, but we felt that it was unnecessary for this grown man to be giving us attitude when we really didn't interact with him for the night.\\n\\nNext is bit of a minor detail and might seem pretentious to some but, it was freaking hot!! Our entire party felt like we were in a sauna. A friend and I had to even take a step outside in the freezing cold just to cool off. Not sure if this was a problem that could be fixed but definitely made the experience a weeee bit less pleasant.\\n\\nDuring the dinner, one person in our party did not enjoy his meal -- at all. He got a gnocchi dish and just was very unhappy, but chose not to say anything to prevent causing any inconvenience to the restaurant. In the end, our waitress asked if he would like a box, which was when he informed her he didn't enjoy. She was extremely understanding and professional and immediately offered to waive his bill -- after offering for them to prepare a new dish, of course. So that was definitely a plus for them!!! We were also surprised with two birthday desserts for the two we were celebrating for. It was so so nice of them and we were so thankful. But here comes the awkward part. When we finally got our bill, not only did they not waive the gnocchi as promised, but we were charged $22 for the cakes. Again, we didn't want to cause trouble for the restaurant so instead of complaining we anticipated to pay for it. In the end, the waitress split all of our checks for us and I think she realized it, because after that the cakes did not show up. Though our friend did have to remind her about his check being taken care of - in which she was super understanding. But still, it left everyone feeling kind of uneasy at the end of the meal. I will give them credit, it was probably an honest mistake. \\n\\nOnto happy thoughts!! I personally really enjoyed my food. I ordered the flat iron steak with potatoes and asparagus. I loved it. The potatoes. MY DEAR GOD, THE POTATOES!!! Absolutely fantastic. I think everyone else enjoyed their food as well!! The prices weren't terrible either, my steak was $23.50, and my white sangria was $8. I really could have been more full, but I was still content. \\n\\nI also loved their ambiance and decor. It was classy, but not so much you felt out of place. Definitely good lighting, bright enough to see your hands in front of you. It was small but so full and lively. They have some art on the wall, some cool lights on the ceiling. Just the entire restaurant was so intimate I loved it. \\n\\nFinally, you could probably already tell that the waitress we had was great. I know serving a large party is really frustrating, especially when we're all young and want separate checks, etc. But she handled everything really really well and was just providing such great service. If it weren't for the water man, I would have assumed everyone there was that kind! \\n\\nRECAP\\n+ ambiance, decor\\n+ my opinion on the food and it's worth for pricing\\n+ waitress was fantastic\\n- wait time\\n- lack of a/c???\\n- man providing waters was short with us\\n- bill confusion in the end"},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - I-Drive","address":"8148 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is by far my favorite of the four Central Florida Locations!

The salad tasted fresh, the soup was hot and flavorful, the fried rice had that very nice stove burn, which personally I love, and the noodles and vegetables were all cooked to perfection, major kudos to our chief for making sure onions were separated since my girlfriend doesn't like onions.

I really should have listened and went somewhere else.

So yes, I feel I am being fair with two stars.\\n\\nFirst off, when booking the reservation, I was placed on hold and transferred to 4 different people to book a party of 10, which shouldn't have been such a big deal. \\n\\nOur party arrives that night on time and are seated immediately which was great, but that's when things started going sour. Like other people have said in their reviews, it took a minimum of 15 minutes to get each drink order. We were enjoying ourselves so we didn't mind the first time, but it got really frustrating for every round after the first, especially since we were paying a minimum of 8 dollars for very small margaritas that really had nothing special about them. Furthermore on that subject, I even ordered a $14 specialty margarita for my second drink that was nothing great at all. I would have enjoyed a scorpion bowl from a crappy Chinese takeout place more than this overpriced stink-drink... \\n\\nWhen it came time to order (45 minutes later) a friend of mine asked the waiter for his opinion on a few dishes. The kid had a \\"deer-in-headlights\\" look on his face, and obviously just blurted out the first dish my buddy mentioned, since he obviously did not know the menu. I've worked in multiple restaurants in the past and can honestly say this waiter was one of the worst waiters ever, or had just started that week. Either way, there's no excuse when people are dishing out that much money at a restaurant. \\n\\nSo we get our food about 30 minutes later (normal for a big party I'd say...) and immediately could sense everyone was upset. The portions were tiny, there was nothing that looked particularly appetizing, and some of the sides people got were cold. Now again I understand shit happens with a big party in a busy restaurant, but we are paying anywhere from 18 - 30 dollars for these plates. Not that that is super expensive, but it was very upsetting to say the least. The food was MARGINAL at best. For comparison sake, I love Border Cafe in Cambridge, and for a place that caters to mostly college age kids at cheaper prices, I'd say Border Cafe was 20 times better than the food at this place. \\n\\nWell that is enough ranting and raving from me, but to sum it all up, I can say confidently that I will NEVER go back to eat here again, and I will definitely be throwing my \\"two cents\\" into a conversation if people are asking about this restaurant!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I took over Valentine's Day this year and took my fianc√© here... the food was amazing!

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that it was a neat, clean, and nearly empty. Surin's is more of a lunch time spot. It was 7:30 pm when we went there. It is the type of place where you order and pay for your food ahead of time and then wait for you them to bring it out. So that is exactly what we did. The wait wasn't too bad, but I thought it could have been a little quicker considering that we were ordering Pad Thai. \\n\\nSo our Pad Thai came out and that was fine except for one problem, we also order sushi that was supposed to come out before the food. Instead the sushi came out about five minutes after the sushi, thwarting the whole appetizer affect. Aside from that the food was very good.

Banh mi literally means \\"bread\\" in Vietnamese.   The Vietnamese baguette is the only bread Vietnamese are known to produce; it what makes a banh mi... \\"Banh Mi\\".  To me, adding some components (pickled carrots, pickled daikon, cilantro, chargrilled lemongrass pork, etc) of a Saigon sub into a dish should not be called otherwise.  However, here in the states it's much simpler to associate those ingredients as banh mi because of its familiarity in the sandwich.\\n\\nWell enough of my useless ramblings and diatribe... onto the review.  I've tried many popular food trucks in all parts of the country during my travels and most of the time I find the food not living up to the hype.  So when I was up in Austin for one afternoon, the Peached Tortilla was really not on my lunch radar.  I was at the Google Building where they were parked and serving that day.  To my surprise I found out they were featured in Food & Wine, Food Channel, and other publications.  And since their Pork Belly Banh mi tacos/sliders are what they're known for... I tried it out.  \\n\\nAgain, the only aspect of a banh mi was the pickled veggies.  However, after I sunk my teeth into those delicious tacos I didn't care what the hell they were called.  It was balanced in flavor profile.  I picked apart each ingredient and tried them individually before I ate it whole.  Pork was tender and savory, the crisp hint of tanginess from the carrots and daikon cut right into the sweetness of the mayo.  My only dissatisfaction was the heavy squirt of sauce.  But hey that's only minor, I'll just tell them to ease up next time around.

My husband loved his omelette and the hash. I tried a bite of the hash browns- I thought they were pretty good, but I suspected due to the lack of crispiness and the uniform small square shape that they were diced frozen potatoes dressed up. It would be nice if they did it with fresh potatoes, like the Friendly Toast.\\n\\nOn the sweet side of things, my husband got a chocolate frappe, which was delicious, and I got the lemon meringue pie. I thought the lemon curd was awesome, and the \\"meringue\\" was tasty and light.\\n\\nAs far as prices, I felt they were fair for the food, but the desserts were small for the price.

Apparently those prices are only good for lunch Monday through Friday. We arrived at noon and were given dinner menus which would be my only complaint and the reason I gave 4 out of 5. Started with Anitpasto and the house Merlot. The antipasto was HUGE and the ingredients were wicked good. The provolone cheese was the best part. The house Merlot was also excellent. The entrees are served family style so we split two dishes between the four of us. Plenty of food and enough to take home. We got the Chicken Parm combo which was chicken parm on top of eggplant Parm. The chicken and eggplant were incredible and the rigatoni was cooked to a perfect al dente. The begin every meal with really fresh bread with dipping oil and are happy to give you more upon request. To sum it up we got four glasses of wine, bread, antipasto, and two family-style dishes with tons of food for $90. Definitely worth a stop if your in the North End."},{"name":"Chez Dodo","address":"427 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has great, unique food.

Our group of six was seated immediately upon arrival and greeted by a friendly, attentive server. We all opted to go for the all-you-can-eat sushi ($18.00 weekend lunch rate) and were given a list of appetizers, noodles, rolls, hand rolls, and nigiri to choose from. The appetizers, mainly the shrimp and vegetable tempura, were the highlight of the afternoon. The noodles came in extremely small portions and the broth seemed to be full of MSG and soy sauce. The sushi list was rather short and didn't offer very exciting options though I didn't expect much more from a buffet. The best roll from the list was probably the rainbow roll, which wouldn't be my top choice at other sushi restaurants. The fish was sliced very thin and it didn't seem all that fresh either. As for dessert, there were various flavors of ice cream (mango, red bean, green tea, vanilla), fried banana, and fruit to choose from.\\n\\nAll in all, a decent place to stuff yourself with sushi but not so much if you are looking for high quality fish and exciting combinations.

There was enough for leftovers so that was boxed and our meals were brought out. Veal marsala was huge and delicious...it was a sweeter marsala taste and I liked it.

I assumed when they suggested the Midwest Grill it was just a typical meat-and-potatoes place.

Thankfully my friend is a seasoned veteran of this place and showed me the ropes. And here's my handy guide for dining here for anyone who might be in the same perdicament. \\n\\n-Maybe I'm stupid, but I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Brazilian BBQ.  I thought it would have been more exotic, but it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill meat and lots of it. With different decor and employees, I would have been convinced it was a some sort of Texas Roadhouse. (Or a Midwestern Roadhouse.  What's with the name?  Is it a reference to Brazil's Midwest?)\\n\\n-$24. All you can eat.\\n\\n-You can go to the buffet to get sides like beans, chicken wings, fries, salad, corn on the cob, fried plantains and more.  But don't fill up too much on them.\\n\\n-The servers come over with big hunks of meat on a sword and offer it to you.  There's a set of tongs on the table with which you grab the meat as they carve it off.  I found all the pork to be great. The sirloin and beef ribs were very good too.  The chicken was dry, the lamb was OK, and I just didn't like the sausage.\\n\\n-The meat  can come fast and furious.  If you go at a slow time, however, there won't be many servers and you'll have to wait.  I went on a Friday at 6 which was perfect.  Busy night, but the place hadn't quite filled up yet so it came fast.\\n\\n-Service was very nice and happy to explain everything to you. \\n\\n-The beer selection is pretty weak.  Especially on draft. But they have Brahma beer if you want to stick with the Brazilian thing. \\n\\n-They have pineapple at the buffet which will help you digest everything.

The flavor is so amazing. You really need the bread to give your taste buds a break. The roll they give you for the sandwiches is one step above the white bread they give if you order meat by the pound. The potato salad is really good. It tasted fresh and light due to the celery and the scant amount of mayo they use. The pickle slices they give on the side we're really good and spicy. \\n\\nI got here at 11:30 and ate at 1:30 n a Friday.

Everything about our experience was wonderful.  A lovely manager (I think?  Never actually caught her title) named Dana took care of us from start to finish, giving me options and planning out our menu in advance, even working with the chef to source some last-of-the-season local veggies for dishes I saw mentioned in other reviews which weren't on the menu by the time of our visit.  Our primary server, Kara, was wonderful as well - attentive and gracious as she shepherded the 20 of us through a nine-dish family style meal.  \\n\\nThe forecast the day of our dinner was for a high of 93, which had me concerned as I contemplated our outdoor dinner, but the setting was perfect.  The fans spaced around the patio keep the pests and the heat at bay, and (at least for those of us working for such a hippie-friendly Austin company) the dogs stationed under most of the other tables added to the charm of the setting.\\n\\nDrinks were very nice, I had a solid Moscow Mule and then one called an El Pepino - the combination of tequila and cucumber was surprisingly good and refreshing.\\n\\nAll the food was wonderful.  Highlights were the brussel sprouts (perfectly cooked), crispy green beans (but can you really go wrong with tempura veggies?), ox tongue sliders (which were very accessible in my book as far as tongue, even for less adventurous eaters), okra (just enough char and spice to make it easily the most flavorful okra I have ever eaten), grilled cheese (don't even think about dessert if you plan on having this, it is incredibly rich and filling) and Dewberry Hills Chicken (savory and deliciously moist).  Personally I would count the pickled veggies and the beet dish the weakest dishes on our menu - but, well, I am not much of a fan of pickled things or beets, so that isn't saying much.\\n\\nI think one of the biggest strengths of the Contigo menu is the range - in putting together this meal, we were easily able to incorporate strong vegetarian options along with meat dishes, and some interesting/exotic dishes (there always seems to be at least some organ meat available) alongside beautifully executed versions of more traditional favorites.  \\n\\nI considered costs very reasonable for the scope of the meal as well.  For the nine dishes we picked out, served family style - with certainly more than enough food to leave everyone stuffed and plenty still on the table - I believe it ran $33 per person before tip, drinks not included.  Drink prices were standard.\\n\\nI will be back in a couple of weeks to try out a more everyday meal with just a few of us, wait times and all, and will update if I experience anything different - but for now I can safely say that if you have a group or work function and are looking for great food and service in a relaxed atmosphere, Contigo has my wholehearted recommendation."},{"name":"Athan's Bakery","address":"1621 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"FOOD:\\nThe baklava here is pretty good.

The baklava cupcake is just okay. I was pretty disappointed with this one actually... it was really just dry baklava with some cream on top. The caramel and pear cake is amazing!!\\n\\nTheir rice pudding is okay. \\n\\nAs for the paninis, most of them are actually terrible. They are pre-made, and when you order one they stick your sandwich in the MICROWAVE for a couple minutes and then finish warming it up in the panini press. The sandwiches are super dry and depending on who cooked it and how closely they were watching your sandwich they often come out BURNT. There have also been several occasions where I ordered a panini to-go and when I opened the box up at home it was not the panini I ordered. This is really how I ended up trying most of the paninis on the menu. Ha!\\n\\nTheir salads are mediocre. It's just a collection of low-quality bits thrown into a plastic bowl. \\n\\nThe croissants are pretty good, although they are best in the morning when they are fresh. \\n\\nThey have an interesting assortment of cookies. Some of them are a bit strange, but others are quite good. None of them are big, warm cookies you would get from a more American style bakery. \\n\\nThe gelato can be kind of lumpy and melted at times, but other times it can be great.

However, for a quick place to grab a snack and some coffee, their lesser customer service is not a major issue for me. \\n\\nAMBIENCE\\n\\nThey have a large number of tables and chairs in the main room, but they are all close together and in rows. There is really no variation in the seating or style to the room. The room also gets quite loud even when it is not completely full. Something about the acoustics in the room heighten the noise level in there. Most of the day Athan's is too loud of a place to study and at their busiest times is too loud to even have a conversation with the person sitting next to you. The music they play is also sometimes a little strange, too loud, and distracting. The artwork at Athen's varies maybe on a monthly basis.

It can be a while to be seated during busy periods. Service can also be slow, at times. Their have been times when no one would come and check on our table. It's almost like they would wait until they thought we were almost done, then come by to give us the check. Then ask if we needed anything.

As we eat I noticed how she had 4-5 open tables but still all dirty, we were her only active table, the host went to seat her again but since all of her tables were dirty she couldn't. Our server was sitting a few tables away talking to another server that was running his check out and counting his checks. Once we got our check she never even bothered to look our way to double check if we needed anything else. This is not the first time that we have had inexperienced service here.

The table next to us was close enough to reach out and touch. You would think that with this proximity, an intimate conversation would be impossible, but the noise level in the diner creates enough of a buzz that everyone's conversation is lost in one big hum. So I say quit your whining and snuggle in! The food is fine and the crowd cheerful. Don't judge this place by how many tables they try to squeeze in.\\n\\nService was lovely and full of energy. The staff was really great at working as a team (you order a side of soy for your coffee from one lady, and another drops it off seamlessly) and they kept the coffees coming. I had the tofu scramble with home fries and orange juice. The home fries are chunks of potato fried to perfection while retaining their inner steamy softness.

The atmosphere is pretty basic, they have flat tv's on the wall which was different to me for a Mexican restaurant. The restaurant was clean and immediately we were served our tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were your regular tortilla chips, but the salsa was very thin from being either watered down or a very cheap brand, it was however spicy which was a plus. Both me and my friend ordered the Nachos Supremo /w chicken and we both were disappointed. The serving was ok for the price...I've been to other Mexican restaurants in this price range and had more food on the plate. The chicken in the nachos was umm...chicken. I say that because it had no seasoning, no flavor it was as if someone boiled a chicken, shredded it and put on the nachos.  Kinda felt like they were hoping the other ingredients would make up for the chicken not having any flavor.  To compensate for the lack of flavor I kept asking for the watered down salsa to make it more enjoyable, and my friend ask for some guacamole to help with his.

At all! And that's something I didn't expect from the place reputed with being Austin's N¬∫2 place for barbecue. Period. Why number 2? Don't know. I have not made it to the other place (yet), but the lines are said to begin forming at 9:00 and they only open at noon, so no, not for me. And then there's La Barbecue's extraordinary brisket. We went for moist as per our Texan friend's recommendation and it was glorious. We didn't believe the guy who told us that half a pound is the average a person eats. It sounded like a hell of a lot of meat. Well... not in Texas and certainly not here! But when we came back for a second helping we did go for the leaner version, which proved just as delicious. My friends Charlie and Veronica might disagree, but it was the perfect continuation to the first two slices, which were delicately marbled and perhaps a little too fatty (for me, anyway). For drinks, a Big Red, several colored Jarritos or TopoChico is as baroque as you can go. No new wave cocktails, no frills. Just good'ol brisket done right and perhaps a brew or two, all bottled no tap. \\nWhen I went round the back and asked if I could take a pic of the smokers, the guy in charge was super friendly and said \\"Sure\\". When I got close to the fire he was putting more wood into, he also made sure that I didn't take a snap of the fire itself. \\"Just not of the fire... there's things in there that are secret...

We were sat in the rear of the restaurant when there were lots of empty tables closer to the middle and the front of the restaurant.  Our waiter came over with someone shadowing him.  He was so soft spoken that I couldn't hear him, so I know the person who was shadowing him couldn't hear him. He didn't ask if it was our first time eating there; didn't ask if we wanted a cocktail.  He started off asking if we wanted guacamole and I asked how many people would it serve because I had seen the menu online and saw it was $14.00. One avocado for $14.00 is a lot.  We decided to order the nachos instead. . . .which were amazing.  After we ordered our nachos, he came back and asked if we wanted salsa and chips. We asked how much for the chips and salsa.  If there wasn't a charge for the chips and salsa, we shouldn't have had to ask. . .they should have been put on the table as soon as we sat down.  There were two of us at our table and we had 3 people bringing out our food.  It was kind of confusing because there were so many black shirts running around. \\n\\nHe didn't sell us on cocktails.  He never asked if we wanted a cocktail; I had to flag him down and ask if we could get a cocktail. My margarita ($9.75) came in a whiskey glass, filled to the top with ice.  Three sips and I was done.  That was our cocktail for the night because the waiter never came back to ask if we wanted another one.  For dinner, I ordered the carnita tacos which were supposed to be served on a sizzling skillet. The skillet was not sizzling.  I could pick it up with my bare hand. The pork was dry without one dusting of seasoning.

My only complaint was even after adding the spicy bomb, it was still not spicy enough for me. \\n\\nMy fiance got the flounder bento box and enjoyed that.

Well, that and 500 more words to describe how wonderful every last little thing is about this restaurant! \\n\\nFrom front to back, this place is gorgeous! The dining room is adorned with giant exotic flower arrangements, chandeliers & candlelight. The covered patio is more of the same, as well as colorful pillows along the bench seating and windows all around. The back deck is HUGE and is covered by sheets of silk and twinkly white lights. Also are a large variety of beautiful plants. \\nAlong the restaurant wall is a painted frame with blank canvas that they use to play movies on. Tonight's movie was \\"Singing in the rain\\". This is definitively something I have to come back for! \\n\\nNow, the food. \\nI started with curry and coconut milk chicken skewers and peanut sauce, fruit (pear) and cheese (blue). That alone was enough and I could have just gone up for seconds and thirds. But - there was also ground pork & mushroom spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce, bruschetta with tomato, parmesan and basil and the best green bean and carrot pasta salad I have ever had! I think it was the hint of peanut that had me. Lastly, we got to sample deep fried squash turnovers with a cheesy dipping sauce - which was being passed out by a server who walked the room. Those were fantastic as well! \\n\\nFor libations, we were served 3 signature cocktails. The Spicy Chameleon, something with the name Captain in it (tropical with a pineapple garnish) and a Basil vodka drink - which was my favorite. I'd be all over the Spicy Chameleon but it wasn't spicy enough. It was for my dinner companions, but I want my lips to be swollen from the heat if you are going to call it \\"Spicy\\". Instead, the hint of cucumber made it very refreshing. \\n\\nThe owner/chef Pat Jeung circulated and visited with guests. What a lovely and hospitable man!

This should be blocked off and considered holy ground, a museum-like tribute to the evening of their handsomest patrons.\\n\\n\\nThe first hour of our stay was uneventful.  We were in a group of about 50 for a going away party and had a very normal bar experience.  But as time went by this wonderful watering hole revealed it's true colors.\\n\\nIt started with the female bartender, T, joking sarcastically with the members of our group.  She seemed confused by her own jokes and on the whole so were we.  In her mind what drinks they did or didn't have and who was or wasn't cut off from service was a sort of revolving door of logic.  Nothing made sense to us or her, but if you waited long enough she'd serve you almost anything.  It wasn't likely to be your first choice, because many first picks she refused to make without explanation, didn't have the glassware for, (false), or didn't know how to ring up.  The good news was that her second choice was always basically a molotov cocktail in a glass.\\n\\n\\nThings turned up a notch when members of our group started laying back on the bar and getting liquor poured into their mouths and in their eyes.  What they lacked in aim they made up for in generosity.  We felt like we were really bonding with the staff at that point.\\n\\n\\nThe relationship progress we were making with the two bartenders was being sidetracked by the busboy, who was one of the drunkest people in the building from the start.  He seemed hazy on the job description, because instead of removing dirty glassware he seemed to spend his time bringing our most handsome group members, (we were a VERY handsome group), full beverages.  Those free beverages he served up did have a cost, though.  The going rate was a large dose of Axe bodyspray directly to the chest and pelvis.  When he wasn't hosing us down he was spraying himself with Axe in the corner or breaking glassware and continuing to work with blood on his clothes.  I'd give him a 6/10 for enthusiasm and a 2/10 for safety.  \\n\\n\\nWhen the bartenders seemed to notice his state they went out of their way to ask me whether he might be drunk on the job.  It seemed obvious when we looked at him because at the time he was wobbling around and hanging onto a computer monitor for dear life, clearly in the middle of a bad case of the spins.  The two bartenders looked back at me, gave me a, \\"ehh, he's probably shitfaced\\", and moved right along.  It might have felt hypocritical to judge him because at this point they were fairly drunk themselves.\\n\\n\\nAny big night out needs to have a contest of some sort.  A good contest should be a battle of strength, wits or stamina.  We settled on arm wrestling and set up in the middle of the bar, throwing bills down to jockey for the winners.  After a few rounds we saw M vault over the bar, (a genuinely impressive physical act), and inject himself into the competition.  He won, earned a big cheer from our group and then started a bar-wide round of rapid fire trivia, all of which were facts about Polish capitals come and gone.  In the end, he admitted to tanning his way into the guido lifestyle to overcompensate for his lack of Italian bloodline.  We gave him a pass and sent him back behind the bar.\\n\\n\\nWhile M knew every one of the two past capitals of Poland, he and T knew nothing about basic math, something we realized when the shots broke out.  An order of six whiskey shots was likely 8-11 shots of vodka.  An order of 3 tequila shots could be 9-14 shots of rum, and at points there was nobody ordering but they were still pouring and auctioning the shots off.  On the whole, this sort of behavior is a testament to bad math and makes me want to push teachers to stop teaching the subject entirely.  \\n\\n\\nAt this point we were all pretty high off of the excitement of arm wrestling, confused from the unexpected trivia, drunk off of miscounted shots and a little alarmed that the busboy was still spraying himself with deodorant in the corner.  We realized the only way to bring things back into balance was a little Christmas cheer.  The Ding Dong Boys, everyone's favorite Christmas singers took to a raised area of the bar to perform their stirring rendition of Carol of the Bells.  Their beautiful voices sung the rallying cry of the evening, snapping everyone into a laser-like focus.  We knew exactly what we needed.  Less shirts and more shots.\\n\\n(1/2)"},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Delicious food and very reasonably priced.

However when the waiter saw me using two bowls to get my ingredients, he quickly told me that he would be charging me for multiple bowls.  I dumped them into the one bowl and told him i was just getting the one bowl, but using two to gather up my ingredients.  He made a snarky remark, \\"funny, sir.\\" I was adamant that i wouldn't be paying the multiple bowl fee for my one bowl of food, just because i had dirtied another bowl.\\n  We eat here pretty frequently, tip well, and don't ask for much.

It was paired with a slightly sweet sauce and freshly made biscuit. Perfection.  Two piece of chicken with a biscuit for $5 is twenty times better than any Popeyes deal! A close of friend of mines does not eat fried chicken at all even had to agree with me how tasty it was! The oyster boudin was very fresh and tasty as well. The fries were fresh and the dipping sauce complimented it very well. The pork belly taco was JUST okay, not something I would order again. \\n\\nDessert: \\nWe shared a dark truffle chocolate cake.

The food is excellent.  The Upsell is not.\\n\\nLAST WEEK:  I paid about $8 for lunch of Dorados which consisted of three tiny tacos smothered in green avocado sauce, cream, and cheese and a bottle of water. I am guessing that the sauce is the kind of detail that keeps Austin Foodies swooning here.  It was the yum.\\n\\nUPSELL:  The extremely nice guy said that the Dorados would not fill me up and that I should consider two more tacos which would have pushed the total to around $13.  For lunch.  Outside. Working up a sweat. Swatting flies away.\\n\\nLAST NIGHT:  I paid about $16.50 to eat an excellent and tasty Mole Coloradito ($11.50) and a cold, small cucumber soup ($4.50). A drink... would have pushed the tally closer to $20.  \\n\\nUPSELL:  The extremely nice guy told me that I should get the Ceviche instead of the soup and proceeded to name off all of the ingredients.  It would have pushed the total, if I had had a drink, to around $23. For dinner.  Outside.  Working up a sweat. Swatting flies away.\\n\\nThe Mole was rich, chocolaty, complex, smokey, tomatoey, super tasty ... excellent actually.  But it was served on plain white rice, no garnish, no vegetable even.  The meat was tough and sparse.  So tough that the plastic knife and fork bent around it onto the paper plate.  The corn tortillas were excellent... fresh and pliable and not dry.  The cucumber soup was cold and refreshing and spicy and perfect.  \\n\\nTHE EXPERIENCE:  Some may call it charming.  For me, it was irritating. If I am going to have reduced services, I expect to pay much less, not more than I would for an actual restaurant.  By \\"reduced services,\\" I mean the following:\\n1.  Picnic table seating.  \\n2.  Comfort depends on the weather... Heat, humidity, rain, sun...\\n3.  Outhouse neatly hidden away in the backyard.\\n4.  Abundance of large, hungry, flies and mosquitoes.\\n5.  Two small fans and no breeze.\\n6.  Sitting in someones front yard, hovering over traffic.\\n7.  The 2 bottles of very necessary bug spray they provided were a generous touch, but once sprayed on hands and feet, kind of made the delicious food taste poisonous.  \\n8.  Utensils are plastic and plates are paper.\\n9.  The retail Upsell on 2 of 2 visits doesn't work for me. Iliana, if you are training your people to do this, please stop it.  Clearly, there is some very high \\"bottom line\\" to fulfill here, but the Upsell is more irritating than the extremely hungry mosquitoes.\\n\\nWhile I would agree that the food here is honest, the price per portion is not, thus the need to Upsell the already overly spendy trailer food to fill you up.\\n\\nWhile the Emperor is not wearing a thread and appears very well-endowed, the joke is on you.*\\n\\n*He is both charming and irritating.  While he is effusively confident, he is really quite tiny.  He is extremely tasty and you may love to have him in your mouth, but you always feel shorted.  Your dedication to tastiness may keep you coming back for more but -while he has a big swagger - you may actually be quite disappointed.

Overall impression - I had a great time and would do it again. To give a breakdown - the service is seriously lacking. It is a small restaurant with probably 15 tables. The d√©cor is cool and young and classy, but the hosts and waiters seemed overwhelmed, which was weird bc even at 10pm on NYE there were several tables open. We arrived early for our reservation and asked to be seated early if possible and went to the bar. Despite there being at least 3 tables open the entire time, the host made us wait an hour (to our original reservation time) to seat us, which was just bizarre given the fact they couldn't have been making much money. The waitress was seriously bad - and I'm not picky at all. She just didn't care - didn't even bother to give us the complimentary homemade chips and dip until I finally asked after she brought our appetizers (I had read the reviews that they were good and they were).  I had an idea from the reviews that the appetizers seemed to be great and the entrees maybe not worth it. We got a couple bottles of wine (the rioja was reasonably priced and great!) and the kobe sliders and goat cheese/mushroom flatbread which were both great! The service sucked so much that we decided we would just head upstairs to the Abby Lane NYE party and get more stuff if needed. The party was fun - although I could have sworn the tickets included a champagne toast but there wasn't any - no biggie. Upstairs is, again, classy and trendy. The music was good. There was actually a good amount of seating and the place was crowded but not insanely packed so we actually were able to rest our feet when we needed. There was a mix of young 30's and 20's. At least it wasn't the \\"clubby\\" atmosphere we were hoping to avoid while still having good music to dance to and a fun, energetic atmosphere. Overall, I would come back here for some appetizers and some wine, but not for dinner. And the NYE party was the best one could hope for when you're looking for that hard to find young 30's crowd. I would give downstairs a 2 and a half or 3 at best for service (except for the kobe and flatbread- those were at least 4 stars!) and upstairs/lounge a 4 - mainly because they played good music and had plenty of seating!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Omg the brisket.

I love the interior - it's modern, cozy, trendy, casual, interesting... manages to be all that and more. I like the art and the set-up. I like being able to see into the kitchen. Basically it's a great environment. The prices are great. I've always had good service too. But let's get right to the food. Now I've been there twice recently and I'm attempting to try everything. \\n\\nMy friends and I just spent November eating in NYC boutique restaurants (like The National and Butter and so on) and everyone agreed that the Salty Sow was comparable in innovative fare and just fabulous technique. The food at the Salty Sow makes me less discontent about missing out on NYC chefs. \\n\\nHere's the breakdown so far:\\n\\nBrussels Sprouts - Pretty much one of the tastiest things I've had in a long time. They are garlicky, crispy, a little salty.. just delicious. I think they have raisins cooked in. Wow. Pretty much everyone at the table loved them - even the supposed diehard haters of Brussels sprouts. We ordered as an appetizer and it was amazing. \\n\\nDeviled Eggs with Truffle Oil and Bacon - Need I say more? Deviled eggs with truffle oil and bacon. There I said it again! OMG.. these are amazing. Perfectly seasoned, so fresh, perfectly boiled... I could have had a bit more bacon actually. Other than that - these are divine.\\n\\nRoasted Beets - Served with a goat cheese that could double as butter. And this vinaigrette that was pretty darn tasty and whole pistachios to boot. It made for a delightful sampler. Two of the guests at my table were raving about the beets. I thought they were not as impressive as some of the other items, but they were certainly fresh and well-presented. I personally prefer the golden beats - everyone else loved the purple ones.\\n\\nCharcuterie & Cheese Board - Super fun and a very large serving. Perfect friend food for two or more. Everyone had fun sampling all of the different items on the board. We got at least two types of pate (or maybe a mousse, not sure), several delicious cheeses, some meats, some olives... other delicious things. It was a big hit and we devoured it in minutes. It was well worth the $16 for four people. \\n\\nCrisp Chicken Thighs - I would pay big money to learn how to make the chicken thighs like this. These are the best chicken thighs I have ever ever ever had. The skin is crispy and I wish there was a way to emphasize the word crisp. Like CRISPY. CRISPY... CRISPY!!! Just so amazing. By far one of my favorite things on the menu. \\n\\nBacon Manhattan - Yep... a Manhattan with bacon in it. I think the word we all decided on to describe it was Intense. The Manhattan lover at our table happily drank it. The rest of us enjoyed the sip but wouldn't do a whole serving. However we all agreed it was a really delightful companion to the crispy chicken thigh. \\n\\nCandied Pork Belly - Was a real delight - both sweet and savory. It came with collard greens and a really fabulous sauce that I think was a soy sauce base. Maybe balsamic. But of the meats we had at the table, it was everyone's least favorite - coming behind both the beef shoulder and the chicken thighs. Least favorite meaning still really fabulous though. \\n\\nBeef Shoulder - This is a pretty amazing dish. Served in a sauce pan - it's comfort food at it's best. Mashed root veggies, thick dark gravy, suuuuper tender beef and topped with an over easy egg. This stuff is pretty amazing. I make a pretty good roast at home - but they do a damn good job. A very large serving worthy of sharing and the perfect thing to order for the very hungry. We had the pecan porter with this and it was very complimentary. \\n\\nDuck Breast - OK, for me, this one was too rich. However, the other diners I sat with swore it was the best thing they ever put in their mouths. Take their suggestion if you're into duck. I went for it bravely and it was just a little too... well, rich. It was served with olives and a very sweet orange sauce which just emphasized the rich dark duck meat. Now it was GOOD... but I couldn't tolerate more than a couple bites. \\n\\nBananas Foster Beignets - Where to begin? OK this stuff is served with a honey and nutmeg ice cream that is sooooooo good. I freaking love that ice cream. I could just eat a big bowl of that really and next time I just may. The beignets themselves are too breaded for me. But again, I was in the rare there because the other diners said it was simply amazing. They took the beignets and I took the ice cream and everyone was happy. The waitress said it was a very popular dessert. We had ours with coffee, which was delightful for dipping beignet in."},{"name":"Lupo","address":"869 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Built in an old house the seating upstairs in the bedrooms looked super cool and the tortellini on special for $18 was excellent.

What a stupid expression.  I don't get it.  I mean Mike's pasta and beer joint?  Joshua Tree?  Sligo's Dive Bomb Bar?  Paris?  Je ne comprends pas.\\n\\nBut now the North End is as old world European as it gets around Boston.  I never really hung out there until I started on a mad going out binge with Meetup.com this year.  You can just hear Mama calling out to her bambinos that it's Prince Spaghetti Day, and feel like you're watching young Rocky Balboa's duking it out in the narrow brick streets of Rome, in the blessed shadow of the Vatican.\\n\\nWhile good Italian restaurants in the North End probably outnumber Dunkin' Donuts inside 128, Assaggio's is a great choice for the autentico experience.  Kind of tightly packed (whaddya expect in da North End?), but they managed to squeeze a dozen of us downstairs comfortably.  Kind of loud during the peak, so I'd slip them some green stuff if you want a place to whisper sweet nothings to each other.  But the faux stone walls, viney wooden beam ceilings, and overhead frescoes upstairs all came together for a nice ambiance.\\n\\nI ordered the house salad, whose defining feature along with fresh greens, vinaigrette dressing and stuff, was the shaved Parmesan cheese.  Yum-O, as a certain vociferous foodie would project above the din.  Large goblets of Merlot, in which to drench your heart like Norah Jones (hey, I even ordered two, to make up for my Buddha experience the other nite with the mango iced tea at Martsa on Elm).  I ordered the lasagna with meat sauce, which was proportionate and cooked to al dente perfection.  But I was jealous of everyone around me that ordered lobster ravioli (although I was just as glad because I eat like an Italian Stallion and five little raviolis just wouldn't do me).  If you like dry Italian bread, then you're in, but for me I like the gooey fresh stuff from Bertucci's just as well.\\n\\nAll in all a good dining experience.  Italian in the North End is never cheap, but you could easily do more damage to your wallet than dining here.  Half a Pavarotti C note, with a generous tip.  I'm giving them four stars, only because no one will ever top Bruna's Ristorante in Chicago's Little Italy."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So this place opened up by my roommate's job.  She goes there frequently and yesterday she invited me to have a late lunch with her here.  She had brought home a Chi Cheng burger and i had some and it was quite tasty.  I was pretty stoked about it having studied the menu prior.  I went with the Willie Nelson (burger \\"blended\\" with bacon, stuffed with american cheeese, tossed in honey bbq sauce, topped with an onion ring and B.B. King sauce *ranch/bbq fusion*).  I was beyond stoked to try this.  Roomie got the Buffalo Bill burger (stuffed with Bleu cheese and tossed in buffalo sauce with jalapenos).  As mentioned in many more reviews, this place is tiny.  There are maybe 4 stools inside and two long community style tables.  It's freaking hot out here!  That said when we got our burgers they are HUGE.  Someone said you needed \\"four hands\\" to eat these things, it's true.  The burgers are good but it seems like it's almost TOO much going on in between those buns.  There are no distinct flavors rather a clusterf*ck of flavors.  I didn't have the raw problem so many people seemed to have.  I swear to god though, i haven't seen so many flies since the \\"feed the children\\" commercials of my youth.  It's pretty disgusting to have SO many flies flying around.

Another great pizza I let them know that we loved the last pizza and how we had bad pizza twice, I also asked if they had made some changes but they swore nothing had changed at all, I was a little skeptical and rightly so because the following weeks ahead we deiced to go pick up our order, we get there and they tell us that they our pizza wasn't ready yet and if we could wait 10 min. They apologized and gave us free drinks as we sat there waiting and waiting and waiting, we watched the cook make at least 10 pies. It seemed they had forgotten to make our pizza since we ended up sitting there for 35 min!

Because when I got into the car I opened the box to see the manager's creation and screamed WTF! The pizza was cover with cheddar cheese and not mozzarella, pepperoni on more than half of the pizza and the sauce AWFUL crust AWFUL!

I assume she wanted us to get up for this 2 top that was no where to be found but I explained to her that no one was here and if it was reserved something should have been labeled on the table. Afterwards she refused to serve us or get the manager. Once I went to find the manager on my own I realized that she had told her whole staff not to help us as if we had done something wrong.

For those who know me, I have a sweet tooth. I love my sweets in the most decadent form; whether it is in a cake, pie, ice cream or any other type of confectionary treat. At the same time, I'm open to trying out vegan and vegetarian and/or gluten-free type items. Everything is fair game and worth giving a shot. \\n\\nSince I was already in downtown Portland, I dropped by Petunia's one lovely, Summer afternoon. The atmosphere is cute, rustic and girly. Lots of flowers, pastel colors and white fixtures. It would be a cute place for a date or just hanging out with girlfriends. I decided to grab a couple slices of cake to share with my friends.\\n\\n[devour]\\n*BLACK & WHITE CAKE ($8) - was NOT that great. I was so disappointed that the cake was dry. In addition, the white frosting didn't blend into the cake portion and everything seemed to fall apart after I tried to grab a piece with my fork to devour. Not cool at all. Furthermore, there was no \\"taste\\" of chocolate other than the huge morsels embedded within the frosting. Although the cake may look nice on the display case, it's deceiving because this cake tasted like I was eating dirt and I felt I would've gotten a better piece of cake from a grocery store. Last but not least, I wasn't too fond of the employee trying to pimp out this cake for me to try. Gullible me fell for it. I should've known it was a doozy as there was only one slice gone from the whole cake and the other items on the display case were half or almost finished. \\n\\n*COCONUT BERRY PASSIONFRUIT CAKE ($8) - was slightly better than the Black and White cake. It had more flavor and fruity-ness and perhaps it was because there were pieces of fresh fruit within the cake filling. The coconut was toasted and was okay. It just added texture, but didn't really give the cake much \\"oomph\\". The passionfruit flavor was pleasant and I felt it was trying to overshadow the soggy-ness of the cake. My only gripe about this cake was that it was a BLOB. Everything was stuck together like glue. Like the Black and White cake, the cake looked nice on the display case, but too is deceiving as the texture was not cake-like at all. I felt like I was eating flavored mush with sliced fruit. \\n\\nI don't want to pull the entitlement card, but if something is $8, I am expecting flawless execution. Sixteen dollars ended up in the arms of the nearest receptacle as it was unbearable to finish. \\n\\nI've had friends bake vegan cakes from scratch and felt theirs tasted way better than Petunia's. I will not order any cakes from here again. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things during my visit here. Although they are known for their pies and other pastries, I am willing to try those items out (everyone deserves a second chance), but it won't be any time soon. \\n\\nYelp 2013 100+ Reviews Challenge (going for 200!) - Review #130"},{"name":"Beijing Kabobs","address":"5090 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 103","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Terrell D. and I went to Te Wei for lunch to scratch off another item from Creative Loafing's Top 100 ATL dishes.  I like their ordering system which consists of you marking the # of items that you want from their menu which is handed to you on a clipboard.  This meal was the least Chinese tasting of all of the Chinese meals I've had.  This is not a negative.  It's just an observation and a function of the type of food (kebabs) that they serve.\\n\\nWe tried several meat kebabs, non-meat kebabs, and non-kebabs.  For the meat kebabs, we tried chicken, beef, lamb, and fish tofu kebabs.  The fish tofu kebabs, which I liked the best, are on CL's Top 100.  They had a delightfully crunchy outside and a soft inside with a subtle seafood flavor finished off with a slight kick.  I thought the other meats were ok.  They were all covered with the same seasoning which provided just a tiny kick.  I didn't think they were spicy.  The fish tofu kebabs are worth going back for.\\n\\nWe tried the bitter melon and snap beans for our non-meat kebabs.  They are served in bowl of hot oily and chili goodness.  The cost of each of these kebabs was $0.60.  Fairly cheap on the surface, but you're only getting 3 slices of bitter melon and 4 snap beans.  The sauce makes these kebabs what they are.\\n\\nThe twisted cruller and wheat cake were our non-kebab orders.  The twisted cruller was not very crunchy or sweet.  The wheat cake was like all other wheat cakes (bland by itself) but was good when used as a sponge to soak up the hot oily and chili goodness for our non-meat kebabs.  \\n\\nOf the items we ordered, only the fish tofu is a \\"must order.\\"  I recommend ordering some of their non-kebab items to help fill you up.  While the meat kebabs are cheap (average around $1 each), they are on the smaller side and it could take quite a few of them to fill you up if you're hungry."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Not as good as Franklin, but still prime BBQ in all of the US.

Your Mom's is literally around the corner from my house, so I was jazzed about having what looked to be a great little counter burger joint right there at my beck and call whenever I was too hungover to voyage, or too lazy to drive. \\n\\nSo I popped in on the way home today during the lunch hour, and was frankly heartened by the fact that the tiny space where I'd so very loved the homemade pupusas of Ponces - which never had more than a few customers - was absolutely overrun with people. I put  in my order for a burger and pickles with the straight-up nice guy working the counter and sat in for what he warned could be a 30-45 minute wait. Easy peasy. \\n\\nI sat there watching the staff doing their best to stay on top of the papel picado string of orders hanging over the griddle. It was a herculean effort as the door swung wide every couple of minutes with new customers and new orders. I knew pretty early on that this was going to be a longer wait, but didn't mind because what I saw coming out looked pretty damn delicious, and many of the exiting folks looked and verbally indicated that they were pleased with their food. \\n\\nAt about an hour into my wait, a fellow had straddled up behind me, apparently a little anxious about his food and wanting to get along. After asking about his order for the third time, the host experienced a lapse that proved to be the fatal blow for my initiatory visit to Your Mom's. He inadvertently handed my order to this wayward soul, who was unable to visually distinguish what his burger was supposed to look like, and compelled to handily molest both the bun and the meat of my meal. \\n\\n\\"This is not what I ordered.\\"\\n\\nNow, I'm all for a little bit of forgiveness for sanitary issues at restaurants; as Mr. Bourdain has said, \\"A little honest dirt is never an impediment to a good meal.\\" That said, I can at least trust foodservers to be kept somewhat honest by the regulatory strictures that are the norm in our country. I cannot, however, know exactly where my fellow diners stand in terms of personal hygiene, nor is there an enforcement body that regulates to what degree one's hands must be clean when entering a restaurant...or even, as here, in the case of a prolonged wait for food, the possibility that my fellow diner might have taken a moment to relieve himself and thought it an unnecessary step se laver les mains. \\n\\nWhen the server realized this error, I could sense a suppressed horror in his eyes, and a swift internal dialogue unfolded:\\n\\n'Should I offer him a new burger?'\\n'Fool! He just waited an hour for that'\\n'Refund his money and apologize?'\\n'A terrible precedent, plus you're surrounded by customers who will notice the mistake.'\\nInstead,\\n\\"I can get you a new bun.\\"\\n\\nUh, no. After the impatient soul (who, by the way, quickly exited the area in shame, and rightfully so-who fucking does that?) diddled my meat...no, I do not want a new bun. \\n\\nI will, however, do you a solid, and not fly into a fit of rage about a wasted hour of my life and the $13 dollars you now OWE me for lunch...\\n\\n...because I want you to succeed. You are nice. You are new. You are trying something a little different. You are close to my cave. You may even be delicious...I wouldn't know.

I had their holy crab appetizer, which was well prepared and tasted great. \\n\\nI also ordered a seafood ramen which was delicious as well. You really get good value for money here. My entree was priced at about $12, but it had a healthy amount of shrimp, calamari and other seafood items in there. Also,the quality of the food was so good that I was more than happy to pay it. \\n\\nTheir customer service was decent, but it definitely has some room for improvement. The only complaint that I did have was that my entree took a little longer than it should have to arrive. The restaurant also wasn't very full that night, so I'm not quite sure what happened. The food was worth the wait, though. I didn't have the opportunity to try their sushi, but if their ramen is any indication, than it's probably very good as well. \\n\\nOne of the issues to be mindful of when going here is parking. There's a small parking lot behind the restaurant, but it tends to get full pretty quickly. You may have to park on a side street or along the road that the parking lot is on.\\n\\nIf you're looking for delicious ramen, look no further! Their ramen is delicious and will not disappoint.

It started the minute that we met the less-than-friendly hostess and were brought to our table upstairs. The waiter was not warm at all, almost smug. I did not see many smiles on most of the other employees either. Which actually may have something to do with the physical layout of the restaurant. It is a townhouse, so it is not a wide footprint. All night I witnessed staff almost colliding with each other with full plates in their arms, and seeming frustrated. I would be too.  One thing that really bothered both me and my husband was that the maitre d or manager came over to our table and asked my father to remove his veteran's cap. He said that they had a \\"no hat\\" policy for the dining room. Now, I had checked beforehand and found no dress policy online. There was also no sign when you walked in. This would not have bothered me as much if I didn't see two pre-teens in shorts, hoodies and sneakers at a nearby table. My father was in nice slacks and a button-down shirt, and his Navy veterans hat.  As for the food, my tenderloin was overcooked, and my husband's halibut was small to be the same price as the tenderloin.  The tiramisu was unremarkable; I've tasted better. One piece of artwork on the wall had a tear as if someone had banged into it in the narrow hallway. Others had scratched frames. When we were leaving, my father wished the maitre d/manager a good evening in Italian. This was the same man who had asked him to remove his hat. The guy looked completely clueless, as if he did not understand a word my father said.  Overall a disappointing experience for the money. I left with the feeling that they are trying to pull off a  feeling of upscale Italian restaurant but falling short. My husband had read some unpleasant  online reviews of Mamma Maria's, which I chose to ignore, because I wanted to go someplace really nice for my birthday. I should have listened to those reviews.

The cocktails themselves were excellent. I had one involving rye that I thought was excellent, and then their speciality gimlet, which was also delicious. These are nice, grown-up drinks, without the spashy colors and sweetness of the cocktails of, say, Om, down the street. They're not quite as trendy as those at Russell House, either, but they're certainly very good. \\nThe drinks aren't exactly super cheap, but if you're just going for a one or two, it's not a terrible bill.\\nI would not say that Casablanca is a hopping place. In fact, it's the exact opposite. But if you're in the mood for a couple of quiet cocktails in Harvard Square, even on a weekend night, it's not a bad place to give a try. The people watching will likely let you down, but you'll be able to hear yourself think and you'll get a seat immediately. So, weigh your options and preferences before going- it might be a great or a terrible place for you on any given night."},{"name":"Derby Joe","address":"142 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"The reason for this five-star review is simple: If you are looking for the best cup of coffee in Salem, this is where to get it.\\n\\nThe cold brew here is consistently excellent. I had a macchiato the other day which was also very good: neither too acidic nor too bitter as espresso can so often be. My husband ordered the \\"moka choka,\\" and while I'm not usually into flavored coffee drinks because they tend to be sooo sweet, I actually loved this one and took so many sips I may have ended up drinking half of it (sorry hubs). If a coffee shop can make cold brew, espresso, and flavored coffee drinks very very well, I feel very confident in recommending anything on their menu. Oh, and the owner of this place really makes an effort to remember people, and by the third or fourth time I went here he had my usual drink ready before I even had time to order it. Such a surprise to me after living in Boston for ten years where everyone's just an anonymous number! \\n\\nA few things to be aware of:\\n- If you're looking for a place to sit with your laptop and a pile of books and get a lot of work done, this probably isn't it. If you want to talk to people and/or obliterate your husband at a game of chess (once again, sorry hubs), then this is your place. \\n- Expect things to be kinda expensive. My first time here, I was shocked that a cappuccino is $5! Like... are you trying to be New York? What? However, I have to say that you do get what you pay for. Yes it's expensive but it's really good coffee.\\n- My coworker said he went here and was spoken to very rudely when he asked to pour his own cream in his coffee. Looks like a few previous reviewers mentioned rudeness also. And it looks like this has always happened when the customer wanted things done differently than they are normally done here. So just know that this is the kind of place where they do things the way they do them and if you don't like it you can go to Starbucks. You should be able to pick up on that from the fact that their menu says decaf is $1,000,000, lol.

I'm vegan so I get my drunken noodles without fish sauce and (unlike other Thai places that sometimes lie about their ingredients) they are really honest and can make the drunken noodles without fish sauce.

Halibut tasted great, and even though I know it is an expensive fish, in my opinion it was quite overpriced for the portion size.\\nThe broccoli dish was run-of-the-mill broccoli and sauce, but the florets weren't very fresh, or had been overcooked, and everything was mushy and the greens had lost their green and were turning yellow. Very mediocre.\\nWe asked \\"What is in the Shanghai Greens veggie dish?\\" they answered \\"Shanghai Greens.\\" I asked for clarification \\"what kind of vegetables is it?\\", they answered \\"oh, bok choy.\\" Perfect, this is exactly what my wife wanted.

The first time we went, we went with a group and all of us were very impressed!  I got the chicken piccata (delicious!)  Our waiter was extremely attentive and accomodating to us.  The second time we went with a group as well.  It was very busy so we put our name in and told to return in 45 minutes.  When we returned we were told there was still another 45 minute wait.  We had such a great time the first time, we decided to stay and wait.  This time I tried the haddock piccata, which they did up special for me, which was very nice.  However, the waitress we had was a complete airhead.  I work in a restaurant as well, and the number 1 no-no is to ask your customers, \\"Do you need change?\\"  Unless we tell you it's all set, BRING IT BACK.  The other huge no-no is not coming back to your customers to thank them for the tip (which I kick myself for being so generous)  Instead, the waitress went and sat at a table and took out her phone and started texting.  The third time we went back to give it another shot because the food really is delicious.  This time we went on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy.  We went with our infant son and a friend.  Well, we were made to feel that having the baby there was an inconvenience.  When we placed his car seat between us on the floor, the waitress scrunched up her nose and complained that he would be in the way if the table next to us got sat (which it didn't and all the tables around us remained empty during our stay).  This time I got the shrimp scampi (wonderful). When we paid our check she never came back with our change and just assumed the way more than 20% tip was for her.

The onion chutney was spicy, so I had my pakora with the tamarind sauce (or was it sambaar?).\\n\\nThe coconut soup ($3.95 on the regular menu) was a sweet coconut drink fit for a dessert filled with too many shreds of unsweetened coconut adding texture to each mouthful.  The poori ($3.95) arrived hot and puffy for an extra $1 charge.  The Lamb Rogan Josh ($11.95) was meaty chunks in a spicy red sauce.  The Chicken Korma ($10.95) was tender chunks of fowl.

The soup itself was tasty, but was a bit spicy.  I ordered everything mild, but after starting with the soup, I can't be certain if the mild cauliflower might have had a touch of heat as well.  Of my two vegetable picks, I liked both, but the edge was given to the cheese.  I enjoyed putting together bites of everything sandwiched between the tender layered bread.  The rice helped to lighten the flavors, while the raita did its job as a cooling agent.  The rice was the one member of my combo plate that unfortunately arrived at room temperature, and unusually clumpy for Indian restaurant rice - everything else was properly hot.\\n\\nIn place of my regular liquid treat - mango lassi - I decided to try their Amrood Lassi $3.95 (a guava twist to our traditional sweet lassi).

We got there at 4, not realizing that the restaurant was closed from 3-5.  The cafe was open, so they let us sit down and drink coffee (fair trade) until 5.  It was a funky little place, reminiscent of a 50s style diner with a hipster twist.  In looking at the menu, it was a little hard to figure out what was vegan vs. vegetarian.  The server told us pretty much everything could be made vegan and all the desserts were vegan.  Mmm.  Desserts.  I'll get to that.  It was a tough choice, but I settled on the Reuben (vegan style).  I'm pretty sure I licked my plate clean.  The seitan was bursting with flavor and paired nicely with the kraut, Russian dressing and daiya vegan cheese.  It came with a little arugula salad and potato salad. They also served local beers and I had a nice Pumpkin Ale from Cambridge Brewing Company.  It was a very filling meal, but I couldn't pass up that dessert case.  I chose something to take home with me. There were revolving trays of desserts in a cold case (reminded me of IHOP).  There were so many to choose from: fruit pies, cream pies, pudding, cakes, cheesecake.  I settled on the Taza chocolate cheesecake with fruit topping.  I like that all their chocolate is Taza, which is fair trade chocolate.  The cheesecake was decadent.  Probably the best cheesecake I've ever had.  It was thick and creamy and the richness was perfection.  The cherry topping on top complemented the bittersweet chocolate.  Definitely looking forward to their brunch and sampling more of their desserts."},{"name":"Mi Tradicion","address":"111 N Stygler Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"We went back again tonight, the food was still as good as before, but the service was terrible.

I travel a lot for work so dining alone is more often an option then not. When I arrived I was immediately taken to a seat, however my seat was a poorly designed, wall-mounted counter looking directly at a wall (talk about a time-out) and a glass window (to the right) that looked straight into another group dining (awkward). I understand wanting to maximize space but not in an already crowded/cluttered/choppy space. If it wasn't already \\"spotlighted\\" that I was dining alone, then sitting, facing a wall, avoiding eye-contact with the group through the window - definitely accomplished that. I then waited for about 10 minutes before being acknowledged with a menu and a hello. Please note I was the only person sitting at this wall-facing counter throughout the night. This lovely space was allotted to seat approximately 4 people based on the number of counter stools. Throughout my meal/ordeal, my server never checked on me (to see how things were going/tasted) except to drop off a menu, my food, my drinks and of course my check. \\n\\nNow, onto the food section of my rant....I started with the blood orange Margarita on the rocks (so good that I ordered 2). Definitely a good choice. I ordered a salad from the specials which included a 110mins egg as a topper. Definitely another good choice. My main entree was the duck (shocker). The duck was cooked to perfection - a nice crispy crust on the skin and a medium to a medium rare center. The food did not let me down but the lack of customer service/consideration did.

When we confronted the waitress about it, she said that the manager changed the price, but didn't put the new price on the menu. What a coincidence that you happened to not change it on the menu. Is fine that you didn't print out the new menu with the new price, but you can at least put a little sticker on the menu to show the new price. We get the whole \\"price is subject to change\\" but let the customer know. We wanted to speak to the manager about it, but they said that he's not in. Another coincidence? Yeah, right. \\n\\nThe waitress looked pissed off because a lot of tables complained to her about it, but you think that people will be fine paying extra that because you happen to not change the menu price.

It was pretty good, a place in a weird location (behind Costco in Richmond) with a nice Western but bar/lounge decor.\\n\\nWe got a Groupon offer and saw that they had a singer in the evenings so I thought we'd give it a try.\\n\\nWhen I made the reservation, the gal on the phone told me they only had 2 locations left, a table beside the singer and a table by the door that she thought might be cold. I opted for the table beside singer.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we noticed the table beside the singer is also in front of the front door. This put us off right away, after sitting down and discussing it with the servers, they decided to offer us another table towards the back of the restaurant. Apparently you can enter the restaurant from the back, which allows some cold air in, no double door there.\\n\\nThe restaurant is nice and clean with a modern lounge type decor, but it seems like they are not sure what they want to be. Seems like a lounge with a singer, seems like a sports bar (they were showing Ultimate Fighting on the TV's), kinda like a high end Chinese-Western food place, with servers who don't speak English well.\\n\\nBased on our Groupon, we ordered a Appetizer - BBQ Pork Neck Slices on a salad, and 2 Entrees - Braised Short Rib and Rack of Lamb. We added a Seafood Puff Pastry soup.\\n\\nThe soup was quite good, it came hot which I like (a lot of places don't serve their cream soups hot) with seafood in it and a nice Puff Pastry baked on top.\\n\\nThe BBQ Pork Neck Slices was nice, the dressing on the salad and the dip for the pork was quite spicy. We liked like it but they should have warned us about that.\\n\\nBoth Entrees were quite good and tasty, I asked my Rack of Lamb to be medium and it was perfect. The only gripe was that it was the perfect amount for us, but we are small eaters, usually going out for appetizers, I think the average patron might be still hungry having to fill up on bread.\\n\\nI was disappointed with the singer, I expected the female singer who sang R&B as indicated on their website, instead we got an older guy who kept singing Christmas songs. I get enough of that in the malls and the radio. Please sing us some non-xmas songs and something more up to date. I love Elvis, but one song from him is enough.\\n\\nAll in all, I felt the food was better than I expected.

Can we agree the show ''Seinfeld'' is arguably the most successful show in history of TV. The show is about ''nothing''. Absolutely nothing...\\n\\nSimple things in life are the most joyful ones. The simpler, the better. It doesn't matter how much we would like to dress ourselves up with social descriptions, texture, sophistication, we are primitives in the core. That's why the best memories are made of plain, but just right moments.\\n\\nHowever showcasing simplicity requires extreme talent, just because there is nowhere to hide. When you are executing simple, mediocrity will take you down faster than a left hook. Also you can not achieve simple greatness just by looking down on it, like in that fancy, pretentious pasta joint by Alma and Dunbar, where foodies fluff each other, and you are dictated about pasta rules served in a family setting... Ugh, only if they knew it is just a simple f...king noodle, and family style eating requires that family feel rather than flawless food technique... You really have to be a simple and a good person to execute that kind of challenge. \\n\\nWelcome to Red Wagon.

A talented guy will show us ''how it is done...'' again...\\n\\nI apologize for the prejudgment. They are a real, nailed it so bad, so on point diner with no pretentiousness  whatsoever. Their egg cookery is flawless, all of the dishes are prepared so well, so thoughtful, plated so beautifully and simply; that it is not even funny anymore. Especially for a busy place. I can assure you eggs are poached to order -with no vinegar-, which is ballsy, but has a very good point. The more vinegar you use, the more you steal from the succulence of the white. Omelets -and I never order one at anywhere- are perfect. Seasoning is always tip top, freshness was never even an issue, prices, for that ''love and care'' is ridiculously low. Oh and that warm, warmer, warmest diner feel, which actually makes you feel you are eating at Monk's in a Seinfeld episode. You have to be heartless to not to love the Red Wagon. \\n\\nOnly really good cooks hit a point in their career to stop and scream ''enough with the bull-shit!!!!!'' And then they take out that unnecessary 18 ingredients from their cooking and plating, start doing little things right.  All of the great cooks I have ever worked for or with had this quality. I do not know him personally, but the guy in charge of the menu looks like one of them. Their duck confit sandwich is out of this world. Deep fried to reheat, which actually makes more sense than pan-frying -the conventional method-, heats up faster, crispier and because the fat has more viscosity than the moister content of the meat, most of it stays inside. A monument of succulence. All the sandwiches, braises, pancakes and pretty much everything on the menu is simply; good and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff looks like they have been friends forever, feels like there is happiness and all other beautiful things that makes us good human beings are lingering in the air. A lot of people attempted this concept, most failed miserably. Except -damn I am so lucky to have you guys in the neighborhood- Red Wagon cafe.

The girl seemed confused about my order, and took several minutes to check with the kitchen to make sure they had received it. It turned out they had, so that was all good. \\n\\n8:10 PM - I called the restaurant to make sure that my order was on the way. They seemed a little confused about the order in the first place, so I called to check-in. I was pleasant (I worked in the service industry for years, so I get it) They said it would be 10 more minutes. \\n\\n8:15 PM - Someone from the restaurant called me back and asked if I had anything other than debit. I guess the restaurant must only have one portable debit machine, because they're pricey to operate. I explained that no, I didn't have any other form of payment handy and the order had already taken over an hour and half.

This time the menu order was reversed. Something new for me. I started with my main which was a chicken breast, organic rice and beautiful veg. Simple but very delicious. All the courses were paired with Port. The combination was amazing. I was impressed by our waiter who had thorough knowledge of each pairing. On to 3 more courses which ended with a cheese plate and a final port. It was all very impressive for $44 plus pairings! My only negative comment would be the rooms' temperature.

I helped myself to some fried plantains, chicken and okra, and sausage and black bean stew over delicious rice.  They had plenty of other things to choose from as well, such as meatballs, fries, chicken parm, black beans, bacon, and yellow rice.  \\n\\nOnce seated, there was a different cut of meat brought to our table almost every five minutes.  Pork loin, beef ribs, sirloin, chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage, kielbasa and garlic bread.  The pork and sirloin were a little dry in my opinion, but everything else was very good.

When I asked about it, with out a word, she turned around and printed out another receipt like I had lost the one she had just given me. Needless to say we finished our drinks, paid the tab and left.\\n    I cannot comment on the food or the happy hour mentioned in the other reviews but the professionalism, service and drink prices are outrageous. All of this is such a shame, as mentioned before, we live in the neighborhood and it would be nice to have a place to go without having to find a place to park in the Virginia-Highlands or having to put up with Buckhead. Maybe the fact that this place opened up for a time then looked to be closed and now opened back up should of been a clue.

The ladies were always at your table filling drinks and the salsa cups.\\n\\nLoved the simple menus that are not overloaded with things trying to accommodate every type of customer, just simple straight forward mexican food.\\n\\nI ordered the Three Taco Combo and paid the up-charge for fajita meats: Chicken and Beef. I have to say that they were all good, but I liked the Beef most.\\nThey were on thick corn tortillas and the tortillas were extremely well cooked. Some places have thin corn tortillas that tear apart when you eat them, but not here. The moisture and flavor in the tortilla kept the whole taco together the entire time you ate them. Spot on perfect.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were really good. The salsa gave you that subtle sweating that you enjoy when eating salsa, showing that it does not over power your taste-buds, but yet does provide you the flavor you crave while you have that glisten of sweat around your brow to show your love for it.\\n\\nOverall, Amaya's is a great lunch stop, or anytime, for taco's and good service."},{"name":"Community Smith","address":"866 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I will try this place again in a few months--new restaurants always take some time to get into their groove, tweak their menus, etc.  It's more like a 3.5 stars than a 3.\\n\\n1.  Solid space, the usual stuff that's en vogue right now: white subway tile, natural rustic modern look.  As the weather is getting nicer, I wonder if they have the rooftop deck, one of the best in Midtown.\\n2.  Starters: Chicken wings confit tasted just like slightly more interesting chicken wings (no doubt it was fried in chicken fat, but I don't know that I care too much), the fried squid is heavy on the batter and light on the squid, and the bone marrow mushrooms were definitely tasty but couldn't detect if it was bone marrow specifically that made them flavorful.  \\n3.  Mains: porchetta is what I ordered, and it's very delicious.  If you like big slices of roasted pork belly that pack some flavor, this is a great order and a great value.  My wife got the magret duck; a little tough, not as succulent as you'd want.  A friend ordered the burger--it has the beginnings of a really good burger, with toasty bread and pickles, but the meat tastes kind of like Wendy's.  Solid, not great.  Another friend ordered the steelhead trout--I didn't try it.\\n4.  Sides: the sides were great, actually.  Brussels were done well, charred and bacon-y, nothing remarkable but no easy feat.  \\n5.  Drinks: solid, some interesting cocktails, especially the one with tobasco and peach liquor.  I like them better than your average Atlanta spot but my go-to spot for mixology is still The Lawrence.\\n5.  Value: priced in the 18-30 range for entrees, so with starters, drinks, tax and tip it comes out to about $50-60 per person.  It doesn't strike as amazing value, but it's not underpriced and the portion sizes are just fine.\\n\\nHoping this place has the ability to stand out in a few months, but if it doesn't, it's not a bad place for a corporate dinner or a casual date.  I'll track their menu and see if it's worth visiting again, but for this type of food, JCT Kitchen in Midtown and Cakes & Ale in Decatur are the standard-bearers.  I'd put Community Smith as a better value than Miller Union (seems way pricey) and Cooks & Soldiers (another new spot that is a bit pricey and hasn't figured it all out yet) and Top Flr (it used to be so awesome but has fallen off in the last few years).  \\n\\nBut it's not in that tier of top spots just yet.

I figured we'd be eating within 20 minutes of opening, especially considering the food truck and picnic table atmosphere, but the line straight up crawled.

Melt in your mouth brisket.  Literally.  Every other time I've had brisket I've always had to either cut off or stomach down the fatty parts, which were always gross.  The fat on this brisket just added to the succulent flavor and texture.  Beautiful smoke rings.    Incredible ribs, though at $5 a rib, kind of hard to justify.  The best pulled pork I've ever had.  There was some sort of cartilage(ish) pig part in it which clearly slipped through quality control, but it was easily removed (and my gf got it, not me!).  Great potato salad and coleslaw, though the bean salad was just average.  I was so full at the end but wanted more of this in my mouth that I was practically forcing it down to not waste any of the goodness.  $60 on bbq for 2 people, and the only thing we didn't finish was the white bread (which I just don't understand).

I ordered the pulled pork pancakes and my friend ordered the crispy pork belly.  Both were delicious!

What a mistake!\\n\\nWe order clams with black beans, fried tofu with vegetables, beef with string beans, and fried pork chops. I have to say that last time I ate at New Golden Gate restaurant, I order similar dishes and they were almost 50% bigger than the dishes I received at New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant. The black bean clams had empty shells everywhere and there couldn't have been more than 1/2 pound of clams (shells included) in that dish that cost $12+. The fried tofu dish was mostly tofu and no vegetables like mushrooms (the 2nd yummiest part of the dish), not to mention way too small. The beef was obviously over-treated with baking soda to loosen, and not too much flavor in it. The fried pork chops were ok, but it's fairly hard to ruin a dish like that, isn't it?\\n\\nWe also ordered a large bowl of rice, which we had to ask 3 times with 2 different servers for. We saw other tables who received their rice WITH their meal, while ours had to arrive separately.\\n\\nEven though the restaurant was half empty when we arrived at 6:00 pm, they seemed in a rush to hurry us out of there, checking every 5 minutes or so to see if we were ready to order. Towards the end of our meal, they keep checking on us every few minutes and start taking dishes from us. I can tell that they are in a hurry and have people waiting outside the door. However, when the service is blatantly rude like that, I feel like just staying there just to get back at them. We were celebrating a birthday there, and the only reason we didn't eat at New Golden Gate was because I did not want to be rushed out of my meal. They went to us at least three times to check if we paid our bill, one women even asked us where our bill was, when another server had already taken my card to be swiped! \\n\\nI'd have to say, they probably were not treating us very nicely because we looked young, and they thought we wouldn't tip well, which we didn't. Usually I tip at least 20% because I, myself, am a server. I understand how hard it is to be a server and how busy it gets when it's rush hour. However, I also realize that if I am a guest at a restaurant and I am here to eat, I want to enjoy myself, take my time, and not be hurried out of a restaurant, which, even though, has horrible food and service, is where I am settling down for a good hour to eat. Obviously, when you're in Chinatown, especially in a Chinese restaurant, you don't really expect much service, but to be outright rude like that!\\n\\nP.S. I have noticed that they keep extra beer in their restrooms.

Great success.\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nThe bad:\\nThe time between the waiters showing up with meat skewers is pretty big, and they only show up with one or two at a time, so if you don't want what they have at the moment you'll have to wait a bit.\\nThe meat, while tasty, ranges in quality so widely that your first sample might be delicious and your second sample of the same type might unchewable.\\nThe ambiance is somewhere between an old country buffet and a pub....... Fine for eatin' but not \\"dining.\\"\\nFor the price you could get an awesome, dry aged steak from whole foods and cook it yourself, plus throw in a respectable red wine.\\nI am writing this after a very long stint in the bathroom. Do the math.\\n\\nSome people would probably love this place, but my take is that, despite the promise of meaty heaven, Midwest is merely so-so. Three stars, including one for a good attempt at reaching for the dream of meaty nirvana."},{"name":"5th St Ribs-N-Blues","address":"86 5th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"A lunchtime favorite of both Tech students and the business people at Technology Square. 5th St. Ribs n Blues offers all the standard barbecue staples: ribs, pulled pork, chicken, lots of sides, and overly sweet tea.

My boyfriend and I waited for about 40 minutes. \\n\\nDuring this time, we checked out Atown which was conveniently next to The Peached Tortilla. This boutique was really neat and I definitely recommend stopping by. There were all the cool handmade works by local artists! And most importantly, it was a great way to kill time.\\n\\nFinally, we were alerted by text that our table was ready. Our hostess was polite where she led us to a high top table in front of the bar. This table was squished in between two other tables and was dimly lit. We asked if we could move to a low top table in a better lit area and the server nicely accommodated us. I really liked where we sat since it was right next to the bright orange shades of tessellated patterns and the lighting was great! We ordered the chicken wings, Malaysia laksa bowl, and the hangar steak ssam.\\n\\nCrispy Umami Chicken Wings with fish sauce vinaigrette, herbs, shallots:\\nIn this appetizer there were three pieces which were delightfully crispy and well seasoned with basil and shallots. This was actually my favorite dish!\\n\\nMalaysia laksa bowl with a poached shrimp, japanese noodles, curry seafood broth, bean sprouts, and a 45 minute egg:\\nAlthough beautifully presented, the Malaysia laksa bowl was a disappointment. The broth was a bit too thick in texture and too strong in seafood flavor. It gets very boring very quickly. However, the shrimp was very tender and the egg was soft boiled perfectly.\\n\\nHangar steak ssam with house kimchi, shiso leaves, rice:\\nThe steak was cooked to a nice medium rare and was also garnished with shiso leaves - smart decision where this herb is minty, cinnamony, and anise-y for lack of better words. There was also a pleasingly tangy aspect to the steak. Using lettuce wraps was not exactly a pleasant surprise as it wasn't mentioned on the menu. Honestly, I don't think the lettuce wraps were necessary even though it can be viewed as more of a \\"fun\\" kind of dish.\\n\\nThe environment was fun and the decor was bright and energetic, but I was not impressed by the food.

The waitperson asked if they wanted cheddar, white cheddar or blue cheese. Blue was chosen. No mention of an additional cost over and above the $2 charge to add cheese.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, the charge for the cheese was $3 so we asked why and were told by the waitperson that the blue cheese was $1 more. Now, she did not say that when the order was placed and it is not mentioned anywhere on the menu. We questioned it and her response was basically \\"too bad\\" and she turned to walk away. Well, we flagged down a manager who, after some discussion, agreed to remove the charge. OK.\\n\\nFast forward to the recent experience when two of us ordered the Burger and Fries and, when asked, both opted for the blue cheese (again, no mention of an up-charge). After the server left, we flashed back on that earlier experience and wondered if it would repeat. Thinking they must've come to some fix, we gave it no further thought.\\n\\nWell, when the bill arrived, there was the extra charge for the cheese but it was $3 instead of two. SO...we asked the server. She said it was the extra charge for the blue cheese. We pointed out she never mentioned it when giving us the choice upon taking our order and, again, it is not stated anywhere on the menu. She sighed and said she'd have a manager come over. The manager was a bit belligerent when said this was the second time this has happened to us, implying the WE should have known about the charge. Well, after several more minutes arguing with him and pointing out that since there's no mention of the charge in the menu that it was completely inappropriate to add it, he did adjust the bill and said he would personally bring the new bill back and would \\"absolutely guarantee\\" that the menu would be corrected from that point on. I wouldn't bet on it but since we won't go back, I guess we'll never know.\\n\\nYes, it was only a couple dollars but the tiny amount (maybe a tablespoon?) of blue cheese was hardly worth an up-charge over the slices of the other cheeses available AND there's a principle involved. I would guess most people never look that closely at the bill and while, it's just $1, over time and many, many orders, that adds up and it's charging customers for something they weren't aware they would be paying extra for.\\n\\nGiven the lack of concern for this business to be up front about some practices, we have lost any desire to return and don't feel we can, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone else.

There was much less variety and a few of the boats were empty.  I think compared to newer sushi places, their conveyer system of boats seems worn, dirty, small and probably harder to clean.  This was about 7:30pm so it's possible they were clearing out before closing.  Also, I added up the cost of our plates and I could swear the woman overcharged us $4 but I didn't want to go back and recount.  So I'd confirm your total matches their total.

We went here about 30 minutes before closing the other night, and couldn't believe how fresh and delicious everything was...The rolls are very well sized, and I like how they cut them into 8 pieces. \\n\\nWe tried a little bit of everything.. the miso soup ($1.50) had lots of seaweed and tofu, and the broth was tasty. The edamame ($1.20) was solid.  The shumai($2.95) wasthe only thing that didn't blow me away they were fried and tasted more like takoyaki than shumai to me. Still, they weren't bad at all.. I'm just used to steamed shumai. \\n\\nThe rolls were definitely the highlight. The sunshine roll ($6.00) is always my favorite.. salmon, mango and avocado.. it's very refreshing tasting. The Go Go roll ($5.50) with BBQ eel was delicious, and very rich. The Longhorn roll ($5.50) with steak was awesome, and I liked the green sauce that they put on it. It was also very rich, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have ordered two rolls with cream cheese but we were really hungry! \\n\\nI love this place.

Maybe if I was, I'd hold Conrad's in higher esteem. \\n\\nAfter moving to Norwood recently, everyone I met demanded I check out Conrad's, \\"the best place to eat in Norwood\\". Finally, I went there last night. We started off with their special of the day teriyaki BBQ wings. They were tiny. TINY. I've never seen wings that small. Look at your pointer finger. Right now. The length from the tip of your finger to your second joint is how long the drummies were. I kid you not. The sauce was tasty but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken piccata, he got \\"Norwood's finest steak tips\\" with mashed potatoes. The piccata was a huge portion, as others have stated. But it was not yummy. It was not anything. Piccata is supposed to be capers, white wine and lemon juice. There were 5 capers in total, no lemon flavor at all. No salt. No pepper. The artichokes tasted like a tin can. The \\"sauce\\" was just chicken broth. I'm really not a terribly picky eater, but I couldn't finish it. It was just a bowl of warm blah. \\n\\nWhen I go out to an actual restaurant, I kinda expect to get something that is better than what I can make at home. That's why I'm paying someone else to prepare a meal for me. His steak tips were ok, no char on them but had the smokey charcoal flavor to them...can we say \\"liquid smoke\\"? The potatoes were pretty vile, unabashedly instant with no butter or salt. When the waitress (who was efficient, but did not give me the warm and fuzzies) came over to ask if we wanted to bring our leftovers home, I said no. You'd think that seeing a full dish in front of someone and them saying \\"no I don't want to bring it home\\", there would be a red flag. The woman just said \\"ok\\" and took it away. \\n\\nThe beers were subpar, as others have said they are all similar (Miller light, Coors light, Michelob, but blessedly Guinness was on tap. I didn't like how there was Keno on every single table.

But this place promised Korean Barbecue?\\n\\nSo I finally decided today was the day I'd give it a try. I needed to do something different, and healthy isn't a bad word.\\n\\nAs soon as I walked in, the gentle clean aroma of the food, mingled with the scent of tea leaves struck me. The place also considers tea a specialty, and they have about a hundred varieties.\\n\\nMy order was taken by the gravely courteous owner, who made some suggestions for a first timer, (and rightly pegging me for someone who likes protein).\\n\\nI also opted to try their \\"Cup of peace\\" - which turned out to be an utterly splendid, faintly-spiced, and frankly perfect cup of tea. Normally, I'm the sort to sweeten tea, but this was absolutely perfect, all by itself.\\n\\nThe premise of the shop seems to be a synthesis of ideals of balance, peace, and ki, with great-tasting and healthy food, and it manages this without appearing pretentious or silly at all.

Yes, my mouth started watering as I got close.\\n\\nReturning to work, I sat down to eat, and from the first mouthful, I knew I'd be returning. Simply exquisite. The dish came with two small pots of sauce, but whenever I try something new, I try it without additions.\\n\\nAfter a couple of bites of utter heaven, I dashed the little pot of fish sauce, which had little bits of herb floating in it across everything. Normally I'm sparing, but this felt like the way to go. Heaven got better. I upended the hot sauce pot, and from that point on, all I could do was eat.\\n\\nNormally, at meals, I am either engaged in conversation with someone, or I'm reading. I rarely just sit and eat. Suffice to say, I put my book down, to focus on this food. The \\"Cup of Peace\\" went with it brilliantly, I might add. This simple meal added up to such a cohesive whole, it was brilliant.\\n\\nIn any case, if I haven't gushed enough, let's just say I don't hesitate to recommend a trip to \\"A Cup of Peace\\".

My only comment was that I wished they told us what type of steamed fish we were getting.  This was a packaged course deal and had I have known, I probably would've upgraded to a flounder or a bass.  Still tasted great but just saying. \\n\\nHong Kong style beef -  I didn't personally try this dish but everyone on our table commented that it was very tender and flavorful and we're dealing with a bunch of prime rib connoisseurs so I thought to make mention of it here.\\n\\nWalnut Shrimp - Ordered this for my daughter as it's all she ever eats at these restaurants.  For what the dish actually is, they do make it well here.   \\n\\nStir fried water spinach with bean curd - Great addition to the course spread.  I'm used to more of a stronger bean curd flavor though and that may sound bad but it's so good that way.  \\n\\nThe other dishes were decent as well but too many to note here.  Overall, the food was very fresh and service was friendly and attentive.  My only gripe about the place is probably the space.  It's a bit tight and with our large party, we would've preferred better seating than way back in the restaurant and scrunched up in the corner.  \\n\\nWould definitely recommend this for local fresh seafood.

Elderly businessmen in suits chortle over enormous portions of meat. Visit while under the influence of mind-altering drugs and you will be convinced you invented a time machine. It is just a little too loud for easy conversation, but the ambiance more than makes up for it. The one thing which detracted from the experience was the iPad wine list, which took up a bit too much space on our table and made it a little more difficult to imagine oneself transported to 1947 as the owner of a large telegraph company.\\n\\nDespite popping in for two salads and some cheese toast (and despite being a third the age of the average customer and making a tenth of their income), we were taken care of so nicely I thought we might have been mistaken for old-timey Mafia dons.

No way we were going to wait hours for Franklin; don't care how good it is.  And I hear a lot of people say La Barbecue is just as good or better.  We got there about 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  After reading all the reviews about waiting, I was prepared for a line, but there wasn't one; but all the sides were sold out.  Nobody in line when we got there, and only two groups at tables in the open field that stands for the \\"restaurant\\".  The staff was very friendly, but we just ordered a half-pound of brisket and a bottle of water.   We tried the BBQ sauces, and one was really good.  Very vinegary and peppery, with some additional flavors we couldn't place, but excellent.   But the brisket was amazing.  Best brisket I think I've ever had.

I received my menu and was looked at with disdain by my waitress when I asked her about her opinion regarding my food choices. After I received my drink I was ignored until I received my food and from there I was only checked on once. I started to notice that all of the tables around me, especially the one right next to me were being better taken care of. Chairs pulled out, waiting on orders, food and drinks brought out faster. And here I was still waiting.\\n\\nIt is so unfortunate that the service is not better as the food is delicious and has an awesome modern spin. I got the shrimp tacos, which had kale and a delightful aoli sauce on it. Did not much care for the fact that the shrimp was fried, but it had a nice and light crunch to it. The chips and salsa are nothing to sneeze at as the salsa has just the right amount of kick to burn your mouth. \\n\\nI am giving it 3 stars instead of two as I explained all of this to one of the bartenders/servers and he was so nice.

I've been dining with you and your families since you were on Berkman Drive.  I patronized your Bastrop location while it was open, as well as your Oak Hill location while it was open.  After dining with you 3 or 4 times a month, many times more than that, my love affair with Amaya's has come to an end.  I visited your new location on Reinli and I35 this morning.  Turns out it was only a visit as we left without ever being seated.  We were offered seats at the bar, but a big guy like me doesn't perch like a tweety bird.  We agreed to wait for a table and were given a pager.  After 3 (THREE) parties who entered and were seated, 2 without even signing in, just greeted and walked to a table we left.  Your hostess is not very hospitable.  Instead we went and spent our $$$ with a competitor.  I called from the car to speak to a manager.  After holding for 12+ minutes I finally spoke to a girl who said she was in charge today.  From her attitude and condescending tone of voice I can understand why the help is acting the way they do to your customers.  They have a lousy example to follow.  So this afternoon I'm spending my time posting this review on as many sites as I can find.

I had very high expectations considering it's a seafood house located in Steveston by the water where they most likely catch the fresh fish! \\n\\nThe atmosphere could use an update but I did appreciate that we were seated by the window with a cute little setup, thanks to my husbands reservation request!  My husband and myself were very disappointed in the food. Service was usual not over the top but not horrible. Nothing on the menu stood out to us to order. I actually had a hard time deciding what to order due to this. My husband ended up settling with the seafood pasta and I ordered the beef carpaccio and the shrimp avocado salad. We also ordered an oyster each just to give them a try. Now this was my first time trying an oyster, I did enjoy it but it had sand in it not sure if that's something to expect with oysters? The lids of the hot sauce and lea sauce were dirty and left with crusty remains from over usage. Honestly that's not hard to whip before it gets severed on the consumers table considering it's fine dining attention to detail like this is a must.\\n\\nLastly the resto knew it was my birthday and the waitress didn't bring out a dessert or even write hbd on the dessert plate we ended up ordering ourselves. I mean a little acknowledgement that it's my birthday would have been nice, we are out eating here because it is my birthday! For dessert we settled with the chocolate cake bomb; concept was cool, the theatrical effect of it was great but over all desert was disappointing, overly sweet and not much inside.\\n\\nIn my opinion It's just one of those places not to even bother trying once in my books and no interest in returning.

The cheese curds are filling and have tons of flavor. I can't get over how good they are. The croissants are soft, fluffy, flaky, and probably the best croissant I've ever had.

I had the country fried steak which was fantastic. The meal was enough to save for later unless you want to be uncomfortably full. The gravy and mashed potatoes were just right and the steak itself was fried perfectly. I haven't had any of their desserts because the dinner portions are pretty big so there really isn't any room left. The staff is friendly and eager to serve you, and the ambiance/decor, to me, doesn't fit the menu. Don't know if that makes sense.

I haven't had Franklin's but if you don't have 4 hours to wait in line, La Barbecue is real nice."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My (lunchtime) world is absolutely devastated! \\n\\nWorking downtown (and previously having had worked in Taylor, home to Louis Mueller BBQ) I was desperate for a good BBQ joint that I wouldn't have to stand in line for 2+ hours for (Franklin BBQ). All the other places in the downtown area completely suck, since they are complete tourist traps (Stubb's & Iron Works). \\n\\nI absolutely enjoyed the heck out of JMueller before John Mueller did whatever he did and got ousted from the company (none of my business, it doesn't matter to me since I'm only commenting on the quality of the food). From what I understand, he was the pit master while his sister, Lee Anne (hence LA BBQ) was the individual carrying the financial burden and investment. \\n\\nFirst, I'm going to get my most serious gripe out of the way. I pretty much get the same damn thing every time I go to eat at a Texas BBQ joint: 1/4 pound brisket, 1/4 pound sausage, a rib (beef or pork or both), some cheddar cheese, a few jalapenos, and a soda (or tea). \\n\\nMy bill was over $36 freaking bucks! This was just for me, by myself! My elder brother was with me, and I totally wasn't paying his bill. This amount was for the amount of food that I described above. Really! Thirty-six American dollars? For a few seconds, I thought they were charging me in pesos! You've got to be kidding me! I had been to JMueller 5 times since I found out about him (over the past year). I was there AT LEAST monthly. Anyway, like I said, I almost always get the same thing. My bill NEVER went over $15... ever... unless I bought for someone else. \\n\\nOK, so the prices had more than doubled. That should be my greatest complaint, right? Oh no, wait, there's more! Let me get out of the way my compliments before I tear this place to shreds. My beef rib (humongous), potato salad, sausage, and jalapenos (you really can't ruin those) were absolutely fantastic! However (a very GRAND however), I don't go to a Texas BBQ joint for those secondary items. Just like I rate Tex-Mex establishments on their cheese enchiladas (and not the refried beans and rice, for all you Yanks), the baseline I have established for Texas BBQ is the quality of the brisket.\\n\\nA little over a decade ago, I was in Taylor. There were two major competing forces in the world of BBQ in that tiny town. One was Mikeska's (one of the ruling families of Texas BBQ) and one was Mueller's. Mikeska's was where I learned what Liquid Smoke was and what affects it had on my body. I can never forget that taste, and what I experienced afterwards (I won't illustrate the culinary and digestive unpleasantness right now, since that's just inappropriate) but the only thing going for that establishment was the weekly all-you-can-eat chicken fried steak Thursdays. While I eventually broke my personal record of fatness as I crossed over the 300 pound mark, I never had a second helping of their BBQ. \\n\\nHowever, forever imprinted on my taste buds and my mind is the distinct taste of Liquid Smoke. Liquid Smoke is a miracle for some, as it grants them a reprieve from slowly smoking a lovely brisket for 6 to 10 hours. As most Texas BBQ connoisseurs know, this is basically a cardinal sin. The result:  The taste of Liquid Smoke and the increased profits of using Liquid Smoke in place of legitimate BBQing. The most significant clue was that the brisket had NO SMOKE RING. Every Texan knows that there are identifiable smoke rings in their briskets. \\n\\nI know that Lee Anne has hired their pit master from Franklin's, but he must be under duress to perform his job as cheaply as possible. \\n\\nIn summation, I would totally be willing to spend $36 for culinary ecstasy, but this was quite the opposite. They could not pay me to come back. My brother and I suffered for a least the next day. Please heed my warning and stay away. I have no allegiances to John Mueller other than the fact that he ran that trailer like a rock star!"},{"name":"Eastside Asian Market","address":"12950 E Colonial Dr, Ste 106","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, what a great find! Thanks to Joe C's great review, and me realizing this is really close to my house, I had to check it out. It's smaller than a lot of the big Asian markets I've been to, but it's big enough to carry just about everything you're looking for. \\n\\nAs a vegetarian, many of the Asian markets in town are must-visits if you're looking for something a little different. They've got fake just about everything, from shrimp to chicken, burgers to whole duck. Eastside has a similar (albeit smaller) selection of these.\\n\\nMost of these markets all kinda carry the same stuff. So what sets Eastside apart? For one, the store is clean. This may be partially because it's new, but doesn't seem to have that funk of age on it that many of them do. More importantly, the service. It would seem like many of these markets that this place is family run. Both the mother and son (I'm guessing here) introduced themselves to me, noticed what I was purchasing and asked whether I'm a vegetarian. They both are, it turns out, and mom is really enthusiastic when another vegetarian comes in the shop. She immediately began running around grabbing things she thought I should try. The son explained how excited she gets. No apology needed, for me as a customer that's wonderful. \\n\\nMom brought me over a jar of something with no English on it. The son explained it was a kind of preserved olive leaves in oil, and it's good tossed with tofu. She ran into the kitchen (they have a small deli on site where they'll make you many options, all vegetarian), and came back out with an opened jar, and gave me a forkful. She was right.... DELICIOUS. \\n\\nI walked out of there with more than I originally planned on purchasing, all with good tips on how to prepare it. What a seriously wonderful shopping experience. Owners who obviously care about their products, their customers, and have a passion for what they're selling. \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: This is NOT a vegetarian store, if you're just looking for a \\"regular\\" Asian market, they have everything you're used to. They're just vegetarian owners, and everything served in the deli is vegetarian. \\n\\nHighly recommended.

The woman at the counter was pleasant and friendly. The food once ordered did not arrive in 5 mins. which gave us hope that at least it was being cooked to order and had not sat under a heat lamp for six hours. However, the wait was not worth it. Two entrees were ordered, the adobo de puerco and Aji de Gallinaa, a chicken dish stewed in sauce with peanuts and eggs. Both had been so overcooked that they had lost all tenderness and moisture. Dry meat with sauce. The cruelest cut was the total lack of any seasoning, including salt.  Bland and with no character.

Sit back, relax, have a couple of smoked oyster shooters to pass the time while enjoying a CAN of some local craft beer.  I emphasized the word can as a positive because nothing says backyard BBQ like a cold can of beer.  It fits.  The hot links are a must have as are the lamb baby back ribs.

The only questionable decorations were these weirdo fuzzy half planets on the ceiling. I didn't quite get it.\\n\\nWe were greeted by a bubbly hostess who gave us our pick of seats and menus. Our first goal was to order some big girl drinks. The drink menu was packed with decadent martinis sure to please any appetite. From the simple cosmo to the more complicated blue parrot martini.  I opted for a grapefruit martini, and my friend order a drink with a name like tutti-fruity-bootie or something like that......it  leaned more on the complicated side.   One quick glance at the menu and I knew I was in for a real treat. It contained items like steamed mussels with saffron sauce, and bacon wrapped chorizo (how much pork can you take?) with blue cheese and dates. We started off with the hummus with assorted veggies and worked our way up from there. I like a little more spice than this hummus had, but overall it was pretty good.  We each ordered a couple of choices to share. The chorizo and potato empanadas were excellent, so were the crab cakes with aioli, but my favorite thing was blackened chicken with mango sauce. It was a mix of spicy calypso flavors and sweet & tangy mango. What a combo! Throughout this whole food-fest our server was so accommodating. He made suggestions, and  answered any questions we had.

Instead, we're talking about the toppings (insert your Allen Iverson's \\"practice, we're talking about practice?\\" tone).  When did our burger society gotten so douche-y that we're talking about a burger joint based on their toppings?  Isn't burger about meat, bun, and cheese?\\n\\nFine, let's entertain the toppings a bit since this is their supposed strength.  Yes, they have a lot of selections.  But the problem is that all topings are luke warm, if not cold (and I'm not refering to food that's suppose to be cold).  Luke warm grilled onions, almost cold mushrooms...it made the burgers even worse.  \\n\\nSo strip away the toppings and Five Guys is just...not very good.  The meat was dry with zero taste.  Bun was nothing special and cheese was just cheese.  Chances are, if you put their meat next to a Big Mac, you won't be able to tell the difference.  \\n\\nThen there's the fries.  Again, nothing special.  Actually, I think I like McD's chemically enhanced french fries better.  Yes, the sizes were big.  But for the price, it really should be.

In Vancouver though, the chocolate is disgusting it tastes cheap. The Latina/Spanish female manager is so cheap and rude. I was waiting all week for an amazing dessert cuz I had high expectations based on my previous experiences: I ordered the triple fondue which has white, milk and dark chocolate I asked the waitress to put more dark than white she ended up giving me a bowl with barely ANY milk or white in it just like a line of garnish on top. I was like wtf? I asked her to just give me the standard triple instead but she refused. I tried to eat it but I couldn't it was so bitter and NOT what I wanted. She was like forcing me to have a bad experience. She wanted to charge me to  change it as a \\"refill\\" whereas I barely ate anything of it. Worst service not because of waiting or anything like that but because they don't give a shit about ur experience. After I couldn't eat it out of disgust, I went back to the counter and insisted to change it I wasn't happy with the taste she said \\"ok I'll pay for it myself\\". She ended up almost throwing at my table with the utmost careless attitude a fondue with only milk and white chocolate. That's NOT what I asked hot damn it! It was disgusting. It's not the chocolate place paradise u dream of. You can do better yourself at home. So not worth the trip to dt. Never coming back here again. I was going to bring my sis but now, hell no.

The food was decent except for the creme br√ªl√©e which was disgusting. Drinks (I had the Sangria) were delicious. The service was HORRIBLE and the reason for the single star. I was concerned about being cold & stated this from the moment I walked in and I noticed a/c was blaring. Since I went straight there from work. I didn't have a jacket. I decided to sit in the enclosed patio section (seemed warmer at the time than the inside restaurant area because of the air conditioning) but the host sat us at the table closest to the patio door. I again said that I was concerned about it being too cold and my concerns were dismissed. The guy told me to sit down and it would be a nice night. I was shocked but he assured me that the heater next to the table would be turned on as soon as I requested it.  Then the server appears. He's a rough looking, hairy guy who seems to lack social skills and had no interest in \\"wow\\"ing us. We asked questions about drinks and items on the food menu as we were 1st timers. If it wasn't his favorite item, he had zero input to offer. I overheard him complaining about 1 of his tables. Couldn't know for sure if it was ours but he seemed to be overwhelmed by the volume. Later in the evening, as I suspected, it got cooler. I asked for the heater to be turned on and it was not working. The propane tank was clearly marked that it's empty. And of course the 20 other tables that were all empty when I was seated at the table by the door were now all taken when I was sitting next to the door freezing.

Their wine list isn't huge, but they've got some very solid Chilean wines at rational pricepoints to go with your Temple of Meat experience. And while I know you're supposed to minimize your takes from the cold buffet in order to eat more of the meat-on-swords, some of their cold buffet salads are really tasty and worth checking out.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is usually jumping, although be warned that the Portugese guitarist guy they have in pretty often is amped noticeably louder than he should be, making it tough to have a conversation in the room he plays in.

It was a piece of ravioli and my unfoodie friends called the inside \\"soupy\\". Correct me if I am wrong, but ravioli should certainly not be considered \\"soupy\\" inside. Anyway, next came the (actual) soup which was in a nice little cup masquerading as a bowl (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/tr3Jr2ubRK80W5dprHrC2g?select=ZRfHZwSLUI7uQou0cfy3OQ#aaV-3d16hN47PMQlNI6fCw) and another appetizer that was interpreted as being croquettes. Then  A tiny piece of oily  fried chicken thrown onto a plate with the most delicious biscuit. With gravy, chicken gravy just like they do in the southern U.S. (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/tr3Jr2ubRK80W5dprHrC2g?select=ZRfHZwSLUI7uQou0cfy3OQ#j2EHoGlDAgvaP0K9aSORWA) . Now that I think about it I am surprised there was no grits...or are grits a breakfast thing...idk...in any case dessert followed and I chose the Creme brulee while my friends had the apple tart. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/tr3Jr2ubRK80W5dprHrC2g?select=ZRfHZwSLUI7uQou0cfy3OQ#jU46_kVrm29_QZp54J4oWw  The dessert had blackberries on it, which correct me if I am wrong, are outta season in December. And they tasted defrosted. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/tr3Jr2ubRK80W5dprHrC2g?select=ZRfHZwSLUI7uQou0cfy3OQ#h2uGvv-hlcPe42-avWXuOw\\n\\nOver all I would say that I was not overly impressed with the food. I thought stuff tasted too pre-fab for me. Like the freaken pork balls and sausage roll...really? http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/tr3Jr2ubRK80W5dprHrC2g?select=ZRfHZwSLUI7uQou0cfy3OQ#O8QAKWEld6VN12oOYFdlXQ  i can get that for a buck at the deli counter. And the dessert, I would have rather NOT had any berries at all. \\n\\nSo I would not return based on location (middle of no where in the sketchiest part of town) and poor quality of food(everything tasted pre-made and reheated). I would have also preferred a more experienced waitress as it seemed the knowledgeable waiter we had gave up half way through the night. They would drop the dish then announce what it was when not all of us were listening.  So it was not the intimate evening with the chef as first suggested.

I am less inclined to go anywhere I don't find culinarily interesting.  I've popped by the Boston area a couple of times over the last six years, and each time was underwhelming for the most part.  There were plenty of vegan options but, before Veggie Galaxy, I wasn't really wowed by anything.\\n\\nShamefully, after discovering Veggie Galaxy over the weekend, I ate here three times in 24 hours.  The food was pure magic and the service delightful and FAST.  The Awesome Marissa made my partner in excessive calorie consumption and I feel extremely welcomed.  She walked us through the intricacies of the menu many times, and shared tales of veghood from around the country.  Her colleagues were also quite nice to talk to, and get delicious food from over and over again.  \\n\\nWe were so excited to learn that the onion rings are vegan! It's next to impossible to find vegan onion rings, and these are damn good! The club sandwich was my favorite: very well balanced favors of basil and smoked tofu, garlicky vegan mayo, good bread, etc.  My partner favored the beer battered tofu with caper sauce, which was a perfect replica of a fried fish sandwich, apparently.  Runners up were: open faced seitan sandwich covered in gravy  (dinner only) and Kendall square burger (the red bell pepper sauce was AMAZING). Minor complaints: only two onion rings on the burger (haha, I'm hella greedy) and the garbanzo bean patty is a little grainy; the black bean patty is much smoother.  We were quite pleased with the herby fries, and did not resist the urge to eat every crispy crumb. \\n\\nThe desserts are all vegan, and we were really sad we couldn't eat every one of them during our short trip.  The banana cream pie, peanut butter chocolate cake, and cheesecake RULED.  I wish the vegan whip cream was a little sweeter, but it was still worth every last spoonful.  The chocolate chip, nay, HUNK cookies were so moist and tasty.

Low lighting, great music, great video entertainment, great drinks list, great food. We started with tea and cinnamon quail eggs, a bowl of kimchi and some toasted laver with rice and ume plum. It was all great. The quail egg yolks were creamy, the sauce complementary. The kimchi was spicy and just tangy enough (and there was a lot of it), and the rice was cooked perfectly. \\nWe continued with some duck heart skewer, some sausage skewer, a seaweed salad, some Hamachi sashimi with lemon and real wasabi and thinly sliced ribeye with some sort of spicy Korean sauce. The duck hearts were to die for: plump, charred and mild with a hint of sweet- spicy marinade. The Hamachi was maybe the best piece of raw fish I'd ever eaten (except those oysters that one time on Vancouver Island). Some seaweed salad is too sweet, this was really well balanced and had chunks of lotus root in it. The other dishes left little to be desired. We washed this down with a couple of great Japanese beers and a delicious cocktail of hot sake and cider- a really incredible combination. \\nComplementary to the experience was a great hole- in- the- wall atmosphere, Cibo Mato (and some other more obscure Japanese girl bands) and a weird Japanese movie about sushi and rapeseed blossoms. \\nWe left only $63 lighter and that included a generous tip because the service was so damn good.    \\nWhy does everybody expect everything to be \\"authentic\\"?

The wine was decently-priced and we were happy with the brand of malbec they had available. We ordered the steak tips; she chose mashed potatoes as her side and I picked the linguine with sauce. They came with house salads. We had to ask for the free bread as they no longer offer it sans request. Kind of disappointing but they do put it right on the front page of the menu so it wasn't as if we were waiting for free bread and had to figure it out for ourselves.\\n\\nWithout further ado:\\n\\nBread: standard french bread-type fare, soft but not warm. Patted butter in foil packages\\n\\nSalad: typical house salad offering with iceberg lettuce (which I actually prefer but I know most people don't). They DRENCHED the salad in dressing; by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl I couldn't eat the marinated leaves sitting in a 1/4\\" of Italian.\\n\\nMashed potatoes: the type that comes out of a box. Improved with the addition of the butter from the free bread.\\n\\nPasta w/ sauce: sauce was flavorless and out of a jar. The pasta was fine: not too cooked, not too hard.\\n\\nSteak tips: I'd asked for them medium rare and they were very rare. My girlfriend ordered then medium-well and hers came out medium-rare. I could have put up with that but they douse them with a sweet and tangy marinade on top of marinading them in the fridge prior to grilling. It's my belief that steak tips should be judged on how they taste when served on their own. That is to say: go ahead and marinate them before grilling but don't put sauce on them when they're served. That's the point of marinade: let the meat soak in the flavor without having to slather it in sauce when served. There was way too much tanginess and sweetness; I couldn't taste the meat. It was really disappointing.\\n\\nI think if I had come into the restaurant with the mindset that this was the chintzy Italian version of Outback Steakhouse (this place is NOT an Italian restaurant; it's a BBQ place that serves pasta) then I wouldn't have minded as much. I just expected more from such a \\"well-known\\" place in the area.\\n\\nFor what we paid vs. what we received in return I probably won't go back.

This is the first BBQ place up here I've eaten at where I have gone in and gotten chicken instead of ribs on more than one occassion.  Chicken is wing quarters only--no messing around with dry, bland, useless breasts. To the guy who's whining that it's only the wing quarter: This is a southern soul food place, not KFC; I agree that some clarity would help, but to anyone who knows what good soul food is--this is the way it's done. Sides are excellent--especially the mac and cheese, green beans, collards, and anything else. There are some specials that haven't been available when I've been there, but I can't wait to try the ox tails or the chitlins. The banana pudding is great.\\n\\nThe woman who runs the place is always smiling and friendly. I've spoken to her a few times about her and her husband's (the chef) background and about southern cooking and she's always been a pleasure to speak with. A little bright shining star in the nasty, rude skies of Boston.\\n\\nA few months back, I told the woman at Gypsy Kitchen about Mrs. Jones.

Look no further!  Tacos La Villa has ingeniously combined the best of both worlds.  I'll break this review into three parts: the atmosphere, the food, and the pricing.  Here goes...\\n\\nThe Atmosphere\\nAs mentioned in other reviews, Tacos La Villa is located in what used to be a Quizno's.  How do I know that?  First, because I ate at the former Quizno's a few times.  Second, because they haven't changed ANYTHING on the inside!  The decor, the furniture, the layout - all the same.  Can you say \\"MMmmmmmm....Toasty!\\"?  \\n\\nThe Food\\nI'm on a mission to try everything on the menu.  My recommendation - start with the tacos.  Everything else I've tried has been great too, but the tacos really steal the show.  There are 7-8 kinds of meats - everything from the safe option of chicken to beef tongue for the more adventurous.  Also, they have a well-appointed toppings bar to let you set your tacos up the way you want them: onion, cilantro, four kinds of salsa, even radishes.  \\n\\nThe Pricing\\nThis place is priced right.  The taco plate is the best value - 3 tacos, rice & beans, and a drink for $5.

Like a mop water and  grease smell...yuck.\\n\\nThe food has some bright spots, but strangely enough, the chicken and waffles is about the worst that I have ever had.  If I had to choose in between this place and just going to Mrs. Winners, It would take me a while to think about that one.\\n\\nThe waffles arent bad, but should be better considering the restaurant.  The chicken?  Blah, tastes like its cooked in day old grease..\\n\\nLast time I went, the fried green tomatoes arent bad, but I am not rushing back so I can get em again...If you want a basket of \\"fried stuff\\", the catfish nuggets actually arent a bad option.\\n\\nI've also had the chicken wings here as a appetizer/side entree...they were pretty decent..just not great.  The Hot n Honey sauce is a little bit different and at least worth a try.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty extensive, considering its a chicken and waffles spot.  But if it were my choice Id tell Gladys to cut all the extra stuff and work on those chicken and waffles...heaven knows they need the help.\\n\\nI wont be back to Gladys Knights.

Not out of this world but generally good. When I first stepped into the bakery I felt I was in a very modern city like room with a large open space. I walked to the wall with the clear viewing plastic bins that hold the pastries. I was shocked to see how much overpriced each item was. I had a difficult time figuring out what to purchase to keep my spending within reason and not feel sad about it. The selection was small I felt and what I saw was not so special. Clearly spending 3 times to 4 times the price for a croissant without any additional topping and or filling was outrages. One regular croissant was $2.85. If you go there you may buy one or two items for $7.50. They sell a pork Tonkatsu sandwich for $6.80.  Its not what you imagine a full size sandwich but in reality it was three finger size little sandwiches something you would see at a party. It was very good but for the price its a ripoff. I felt taken advantage of by way of my wallet. I wish the owner would offer to the public  reasonable prices for their products they make that anyone can afford to taste, the food from a Japanese culture and be able to have a feeling remembered inside themselves when they leave and spread the experience to others.

The entire text is posted at the end of my review with their permission.\\n\\nREVIEW:\\nWow, what a huge disappointment.  I always knew the Northeast was weak when it came to BBQ.  But I had no idea just how low the standards were until I tried this place after reading all the raves on Yelp and other review sites.\\n\\nI pulled up behind the M&M truck and the first thing I did before ordering was check out the cooking area.  That's when I saw the cook sitting there just staring at the half dozen or so racks of ribs with the grill wide open.  That's when I knew coming here was a mistake.  This is not BBQ.  This is grilling.  One of the rules of BBQ is, \\"If you're lookin', it ain't cookin'.\\"  I decided to try it any way, since I drove all the way here.\\n\\nI ordered the combo of ribs and chopped brisket and added an additional meat of chopped pork.  For my two sides, I chose the Spicy Red Beans and Rice and the Collard Greens.\\n\\nFirst off, none of the food tasted like there was any smoke.  So even though everything was cooked on a propane grill, no wood was used to provide any flavoring.  The chopped pork was more like shredded pork and it was dry.  It was kind of like the shredded pork you might find in a Mexican place.  The chopped beef was also shredded, only a little courser than the pork, and on the dry side.  The ribs weren't very tender and, you guessed it, a bit dry.  Even the cornbread was dry.  Everything also smelled rancid.  I used to live upstairs from a Puerto Rican restaurant and they didn't clean their grease traps, so I know the smell.  I'm sure that truck hasn't been cleaned in a while.  I'm a heavy eater but the food was so unappealing that I couldn't get myself to finish it.\\n\\nThe collards were bland although I do have to give praise, because the leaves were still bright green yet tender.  But the best part of the whole meal was the Spicy Red Beans and Rice.  There was just a enough kick to add interest.  The rice they used was the broken long grain, which gave it a texture similar to couscous, but it didn't affect the taste.\\n\\nYou do get a lot for your money and the people who run the business are really nice.  Those are the only reasons this place gets more than one star.\\n\\nUPDATED (11/2/2008):  Here's the message from Geo L. of M&M included with their permission.\\n\\n\\"I respect your opinion and understan you did not enjoy your food. I just want to let you know a few things. The propane tank you seen was attatched to a torch used to ignite the royal oak 100% natural wood charcoal. The grill isn't run on propane. Yes, we do grill but that's our style of BBQ... Smokin' isn't! If your smokin' them then your staring because your cooking them slow so that the smoke marinates into the meat! I do encourage you to give us another shot.\\n\\nGeo\\nM and M Ribs\\"\\n\\nSo, I stand corrected about the propane tank.  They actually use charcoal in the grill.  But their message also confirms that their style of BBQ is grilling, not smoking, which is exactly what I observed.  BBQ \\"style\\" aside, the food still wasn't very good.  My original review was based solely on the quality of the food.  If you're looking for good old-fashioned slow-smoked BBQ like that found in the rest of America, this is not your place, because you will be disappointed.  If you don't care about the method and just want something cheap to fill your belly, then you might like M&M."},{"name":"Kitty O'Shea's Irish Pub and Buffalo Bar","address":"8470 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Very nice chill place, everyone is respectful, they have cheap daily liquor and beer specials, karaoke on Tuesdays (don't know about other nights), pool tables, very nice crowd...

Restaurant was busy so I think we were extremely lucky to get seated without a reservation. \\n\\nService was pretty good. They started us off with a complimentary panzonella salad that was very tasty.  Wine list was fairly short but had a good variety and prices were reasonable so we ordered a bottle. Glassware could have been higher quality but I guess that's part of why the can keep the wine prices lower. \\n\\nFirst course of arugula salad was very nice. Simple with just some parm cheese chunks and lemony vinaigrette. Pork belly appetizer was excellent and large enough to be a full course for some. But of course we had ordered main courses as well so we soldiered on. \\n\\nCrazy Alfredo is well named as it is a spicy cream sauce served on a bed of fettuccine with chicken, sausage, red peppers and more. Sunday macaroni was amazing. A bowl of nicely sauced short rigatoni with a large ultra tender and tasty pork rib, delicious grilled sausage and 4 amazingly tender and flavorful meatballs. Did I mention the meatballs were the size of large eggs. Really large eggs. They were really good. The whole dish was coated in a generous sprinkling of parm cheese and to top it all off a big dollop of ricotta cheese. And not like grocery store bland ricotta cheese this stuff was a cut above that. \\n\\nWe ate and enjoyed what we could but there was just so much food we couldn't finish it all - they graciously packed up the extra for us in to go boxes so we get to enjoy this meal again. Maybe more than once more. There is that much food. \\n\\nWatching the chefs cook was fun and even educational. They are using what appeared to be all good fresh ingredients and most dishes are made on the spot (Sunday macaroni being an exception since that needs to simmer a long time so they clearly had made that ahead of time and reheat as needed which is fine by me). They are generous with cheeses, cream, olive oil and all the things that make Italian food great. \\n\\nWhen dinner was over we were given a complimentary after dinner drink of a chocolate liquor who's name escapes me but which was delicious and a nice way to end the meal. \\n\\nSo why only 4 stars since I clearly like the place and liked the food. One word. Bread. I believe Italian food needs/deserves good bread. We had to ask for bread and what we got I can only describe as overcooked brown and serve rolls out of a package.  And just one each (not that more of these would have been an improvement) That came with a minuscule dish of olive oil and balsamic which was easily absorbed by the dried out bread on first dip. Seriously?  Not quite sure why they would skimp on something like bread but there you have it. \\n\\nI'll be back that's for sure (this actually was our second visit. I recall liking the first time just not the details). I just won't be going there for the bread. I'll be going for the meatballs, pasta and pork belly. And hopefully some more leftovers to enjoy again."},{"name":"Chez Dodo","address":"427 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Dude. Yeah.\\n\\nAsk for extra chutney.

After exiting the restaurant, a homeless man asked my boyfriend and I where we were trying to go. We were expecting directions, not an escort to the nearest Publix, which is what we got.

I was eager to eat some sweets for dinner and am so glad to have a place to get vegan pastries and desserts (and cocktails and savory food) so close to my office downtown. \\n\\nI went with a friend. She had a sandwich and a Water Lily cocktail; I had a Sage Fizz cocktail, and we split a slice of turtle cheesecake and a slice of the chocolate cream pie of some sort. \\n\\nThe presentation was nice, with a sugary sauce and a chocolate drizzle on the side of each dessert, and cocoa powder on the choco cream pie. \\n\\nI was disappointed in the first bite by the chocolate cream pie. The filling was not very rich or tasty, though the texture was good, and the crust was very hard to cut and a bit too thick. The coconut cream dolloped on top was delicious though. My friend liked the crust better than I did. \\n\\nThe turtle cheesecake, on the other hand, should be the new fifth food group. It was INCREDIBLE. I would eat it for every meal. It was dense, rich, and remarkably cheesecakey for a vegan, gluten free dish, and with just the right amount of chocolatey, caramely, nutty goodness on top. Perfection. To be totally honest, this would have been a 3 star review if this cheesecake hadn't knocked my little vegan socks off. \\n\\nMy friend's water lily drink was divine, with beautiful presentation. My Sage Fizz tasted like a big glass of gin, with no sage flavor at all. \\n\\nMy friend thought her sandwich was ok, but apparently whatever variety of Happy Camper gluten free bread they use is strongly flavored and overpowered the sandwich. \\n\\nWait times were long, but it's the first day, so no stars deducted for that.

So imagine my delight when I enter New Jumbo to a wall of tanks containing all sorts of sea creatures, still swimming.  As tasty as eels are, they still freak me out a little bit and I get flashbacks to fishing trips a kid and cutting the line after hooking a dark, slimy eel.  \\n\\nCame with a large group, which allowed me to try nearly a dozen different things.  It would have been a very tough choice to narrow it down to 1 dish had I been alone.  Our selections were seafood-heavy, with a pound of fresh whole shrimp, shrimp balls, clams in spicy sauce, and a whole flounder that was crispy on the outside and tender and flaky inside (bony too!).  The duck tongue was a big hit, with somebody commenting that there's gotta be a lot of mute ducks out there somewhere.  Their fried rice was spot-on and peapod greens were surprisingly full of flavor with no bitterness at all. \\n\\nI'm itching to go back and try the geoduck, which apparently was a little pricey tonight, as well as one of the many lobster presentations they offer.  \\n\\nPS - if anyone decides they want to order that giant lobster, please get in touch with me.

Surprisingly large dining area, and a fun diner counter to watch your food be prepared. Lots of regulars too (an eclectic mix, no less), from the looks of it.\\n\\nAbout the best thing I can say is that the food is effin' cheap. We're talking five dollars cheap if you only drink water.

Our first trip was very disappointing.  This was during their opening week and things were not running smoothly.  When we arrived we were told it was about a 45 minute wait.  I walked though the restaurant and found about 15 open tables and only about 5-8 parties waiting.  We waited and the service was poor and the food was so-so.  The next 2 trips have been in the past month and have shown great improvement to both service and food.  Our latest visit was this past Friday.  We arrived around 5:00 and were seated immediately.  Drinks orders were taken very quickly and brought to the table nearly immediately.  We ordered an appetizer and our dinners.  Usually this scares me to order both at the same time.  It never fails that both our dinner and the appetizer arrives at the same time.  But not this time.  Our Salad came out followed shortly by the appetizer.  Our dinner followed shortly after we finished our salads and the appetizer.  There were 4 of us dinning that evening and all were very satisfied with what we ordered.  And I must say we all ordered very different types of dinners.  One thing that really stood out to us was that everyone really seemed to be working as a team.  If we had an empty plate or drink on the table.  No matter which waiter or waitress happened to be walking past our table they took care of it immediately.

I am surprised I have never written a review too! I have been here to celebrate special occasions and to have a romantic date night with my husband. My husband and I love bringing people here because we feel it is a unique dining experience and you really get the feel of Austin.\\n\\nYou might be wondering if I love this place so much why only 4 stars and not 5 - well let me explain! On my most recent visit I was slightly disappointed in how things were handled (this was the first time ever & I have been here probably 8 times). My mom, sister and nephews were in town visiting and when thinking of a place to eat for dinner on a Saturday night we thought Contigo would be perfect! There were 4 adults and 2 kids (one kid was in a high chair) so a total of 6 spaces at a table. We were told the wait could be up to an hour. We were fine with that and ordered some cocktails to sip on while we waited. Finally our table was ready. The hostess sat us at one of the long tables that is in the front as soon as you walk in the main entrance. These tables can be used for bigger parties and could seat up to 8 or 10 people or what they more often do is seat 2 parties of 4 at them. When we were sat at the table there was no anyone to the other side of us so naturally my nephew sat on the other bench because there wasn't room anywhere else. The high chair was at the end or head of the table. As my nephew sat on that spot I saw the hostess walk away and she kept looking at him intently, but she never said anything. So when the waitress came over to get our drinks I even asked her if it was ok that he sat there and she said absolutely. Then about 5 or 10 minutes later they sat a couple at that end of the table with my nephew .... AWKWARD. The couple was clearly confused as well and looked him like he was a cute kid, but then the hostess asked him to move. My mom then spoke up and was like where is he supposed to sit? They then brought over a chair to the table so he could sit at the head of the table with his brother that was in the high chair. Now have you seen how skinny these picnic tables are? They certainly aren't made for 2 people (even kids) to sit at the head of them. The whole thing was so awkward and weird and really was not a fun way to start off a dinner at a restaurant that I love. In the future I would appreciate if the staff would be more considerate and think everything through.\\n\\nOk now on to the food. The food is AMAZING. I love the rabbit dumplings and I know it is a fan favorite. I always enjoy getting the charcuterie and a variety of veggies to share. The okra and the crispy green beans are both a must get! Oh and the popcorn is always slightly different every time, but always delicious to snack on. The cocktail list changes often too, but they are all so divine! I have yet to be disappointed with a cocktail. Probably one of my favorite things about the restaurant is the atmosphere. It is open to the environment, which is so cool and it is family friendly.\\n\\nI know I will continue to come here and I really think the issue I explained above was poor planning. I hope in the future that does not happen."},{"name":"Louie's Grill","address":"4453 Cemetery Rd","city":"Hilliard","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to Louie's on Sunday at 10:45am for breakfast.

It's a bit fancy and it's definitely not the type of place I would frequent (being a more low-key, casual local and all) but if I was a guest at The Palomar, I would be thrilled that AltoRex was the hotel bar.  The outside terrace has comfy chairs, built-in sofa-type seating and cabanas.  I didn't get the feeling that it's trying to be trendy with the cabanas but that it's trying to be an appealing hotel bar.  I mean, cabanas aren't trendy, they're classics.  And, they completely make sense in Atlanta where daytime rooftop bars can be treacherous in the summer months without the luxury of a cabana to hide in.  Also making sense is the screened-in, covered bar area.  I was there in the evening and there was a really nice breeze blowing through the screened-in bar - it was great.  The fact that it's covered would also make it bearable in the hot Atlanta summer.  I thought the rooftop atmosphere was very pleasant.\\n\\nThe bartenders were super nice and friendly.  We even got to try a few sample concoctions that they were mixing up.  I expected the drinks to be sort of expensive because it is a hotel bar but they were pretty reasonable.  There were several reasonably priced wines on the wine list and my vodka-soda was only $1 more than at Cypress (my basis for all comparisons).  I think that their signature cocktails that have multiple liquors in them, etc. are probably priced higher.\\n\\nWe tried several of the small plates on the menu: crab fondue, tartare tacos (ahi), lobster deviled eggs, calamari and truffle chips.  They were all pretty good although nothing terribly substantial or earth-shattering.  But, definitely solid.  The deviled eggs were a bit runny (but tasty) and they probably should have served more bread with the fondue, but overall everything was OK.\\n\\nThe small plates seemed a bit pricey at first but they have discounts when you order two or three plates from a single section on the menu so it makes it not that bad.  For three of us, each with a cocktail and sharing the five small plates, the total was just over $20 per person.  So, not too bad at all.\\n\\nI would definitely return here for an evening-starting cocktail and a light bite.  I might not hang out here all night but it's a good starting point for a night out or if you just want one or two drinks in a pleasant setting before you call it a night."},{"name":"Silver's Delight","address":"2879 E Point St","city":"East Point","stars":"3","text":"Food was ready on time.

We ordered this (regrettably) and it was the probably one of the worst guacamoles I've ever ordered. Avocado was not at all ripe and to conceal this excessive toppings were added. Our group ordered three sets of tacos and for a Mexican restaurant charging ~$5 per taco you should expect the best. Again, sadly this was not the case.

The food was decent, and as with most of the North End restaurants, you get a lot of food.  However, I just wasn't impressed with their food.  They had a large menu, but I think it was a case of being able to make a lot of decent food, but not excelling on any of them.  I got the lobster ravioli, and it was ok...but I couldn't see myself getting it again.  There wasn't anything wrong with it, but it wasn't great.  I did like the bread at the beginning.  I loved the olive oil with parmesan and red pepper flakes.  \\n\\nThe service was kind of slow, and the waitress was not very attentive.  For the most part, we didn't need very much.  When we did, we had to wait several moments before the waitress remembered that we were there.  It's understandable that they won't be very attentive when she's busy, but we did have to wait a good ten minutes or more before we could ask for parmesan cheese.\\n\\nI am not passing judgement on this, and I could understand why they would do this: every person needs to get their own dish.  You can't share a dish between two people.  If you do, you're subject to a $7 dish fee (or something like that).  Well, maybe I will judge a little bit.  I'm not quite sure I like this policy...your friend couldn't come and be able to just have a drink with you.  I think they're probably one of the few in the North End that do this.\\n\\nTo end on a positive note, La Famiglia Giorgio's is probably a haven for people who have to eat gluten free.  They advertise themselves as having the largest number of gluten-free dishes (over 100).  Looking through their menu, I'm inclined to believe them.  Almost any dish on there can be made to be gluten free.    \\n\\nI would definitely give them a try, and for the quantity of food they provide, it's a good deal."},{"name":"The Hungry I","address":"71 1/2 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Food we had was poor quality and not well prepared.

I admit I am hard to dine with as I have strange allergies, but I really thought they could set me up with a salad without dressing or something.

The food other people were getting really looked good though.  I wanted to try the duck fat fries but the oil they fry it in had cross contamination.  I was really shocked that so many things were pre-fabricated in advance so no changes could be made for people with actual allergies.   Usually the nicer upscale kitchens have at least a few items that can be tweaked to accommodate people like myself.   Aside from the food aspect, it is a fun venue.

It's quite strange that there are 4 employees standing at the hostess desk, and another 4 or 5 lollygagging at the kitchen entrance. Mind you, upon arrival we were told 15 MINUTES for a table. But back to this Kierra person. She placed condiments, straws & napkins on the table as she introduced herself. Straws I found a bit strange, as we'd waited in the hot, springtime Georgia sun for 60 minutes, 20 more at the table with no drinks. What are we using hear straws for?

She allowed me to explain our frustration and was very apologetic. She offered to do anything for us, but it's not about getting anything free or a discount. What you can do for me is hire and train your professionals to be respectful, positive and upbeat when dealing with patrons. After all, we pay your salaries. Needless to say, I won't ever be back.

Everything was cooked perfectly, especially the salmon (seared on the outside, medium rare on the inside) and my wife's California NY strip (medium well on account of her being pregnant).  You must be thinking that the NY strip was dry and tough but it was actually juicy despite being cooked to medium well.  The sauce on the NY strip was also very good, it had depth but not too rich.

Fiance had one of the burgers, with chipotle black bean patty (I was a little sad he didn't choose the chickpea mushroom patty version, I wanted to try it), and I have never seen him eat something so fast.

I read a few articles hyping this place up and of course as a green tea lover I was psyched to try it out.  Upon entering the place, it is huge and inviting but once reality hits you'd want to get out ASAP.  The line is long and inefficient.  One person grabs the pastry order & plates or bags them while another one punches them in the register- perfect system right? Except the cashier had no idea what pastries are in the bag (if ordered to go) so he has to waste time sifting through what was in there and punch them in.\\nAfter the ordering ordeal, you need to find seats.  Most tables seats 2 and there is a lot of wasted space plus the students there that stay for a long time.  If you are not there with another person it's very difficult to find seating.\\nThe redemption is that the drinks come out pretty fast- faster than I could find a seat.  The worker was actually following me, holding my drink while I hunted down seats for my party.\\nI ended up ordering the horjicha latte, beef brisket handroll and the coconut yuzu ice cream.  The latte was ok- I did not taste any green tea flavor at all and I drink green tea every day so I KNOW how it tastes. The handroll was basically just rice and a piece of beef wrapped in seaweed- there was no flavor or sauce to go with it which probably might have helped.  the coconut yuzu ice cream didn't happen- they didn't have it yet but the person didn't hear me when I ordered it and ended up giving me the matcha ice cream.  It was ok ice cream but nothing spectacular and I was expecting more green tea flavor in it."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Good service, on time delivery and hot food.

We were coming once a week after picking up our kids from school we loved it so much. Maybe it's a different chef. I'm not sure, but it's not even mediocre. And the prices are so high with half the portions. For some reason when you order the crab fried rice they bring you a bowl of the stickiest, nastiest fried rice with a handful of canned crab meat on top. I told the waiter to have them cook the crab in prior to him putting it in the system. He came out and said the manager said no, this is how they serve it now and dropped it on the table and walked off. Disgusting! Sad to say we won't be back.

I don't really want to get Chicken & Waffles late at night with all of the party animals (they don't mix well with my drunken shenanigans) so I've gone on the weekend during daylight hours.  What I've found out is that there is always a line on the weekends.  That's to be expected when the product is so good, but one major factor contributing to this was the lack of fast table turnovers.  Gladys's is a place where their customers often sit down at a table and camp out, staying much longer than they should.  That gives way to drunk customers, customers with kids and drunk customers with kids all harassing the hostess for a table because they've been waiting much longer than expected.\\n\\nI need to wrap this up by saying that the staff is courteous and professional, but the bulk of Gladys Knight's clientele will sit at a table or in a booth for what seems like forever while the rest of the world waits on them to leave.

I like barbecue, and can pick out some good North Carolina BBQ, but ain't nobody got time fa dat! After extensive online research and reading local papers, and getting history about BBQ near Austin, I decided on La Barbecue....alot was riding on this decision, since this was my first time trying barbecue in texas, and was on my way out of town. So after researching Texas BBQ, turns out that brisket is something special to people in Texas. Apparently it's made from a part of the cow that is not so tender by nature, but if prepared artfully, can apparently be next-level delicious. My personal favorites for barbecue  (before La Barbecue) is NC style for pulled pork, or Memphis style (ribs). \\nSo after deciding on our barbecue truck venue, we drove to a food truck parking lot and  we waited in line for all of 10 minutes. The guy serving at the window was chopping brisket and gave us each a piece to sample. I will never forget that moment. Wow. Melt in your mouth, tender, smoky, incredible. In an instant, my understanding of what real BBQ is made of had been transformed. La Barbecue was undeniably the best barbecue I have ever had....not only the brisket, but the chopped pork BBQ as well. The sauces were perfect, one of them being very tangy which, on the chopped pork BBQ, reminded me of NC style BBQ with a spicy vinegar-like sauce. La Barbecue is the best barbecue I have ever had. That brisket was damn good."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"YES. Just yes.\\n\\nHappy hour is incredible here.

They were out of a few menu items, and their ramen broth wasn't super flavorful compared to a couple of other places in town. That being said, they gave very generous portions of extras (menma, chashu, etc) with the ramen. However, my girlfriend and I both had upset stomachs after, even though neither of us finished our bowls. All in all, when I think of this place (location off of West Anderson near guitar center), I am not tempted to go back. There are lots of other really good places in Austin I'd rather go.\\nPositive note: They did have Guy Fieri on the tv on mute and we really had a blast making up new dubs for the show."},{"name":"Midwest Grill Brazilian BBQ","address":"1124 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Midwest grill was our first time going in Cambridge.

I had an appointment in the A.M with them,  a male called and said \\"Oh our technician had additional work today at a home and won't make it to the appointment until later, so I rescheduled to mid day around 2:00 pm. Same thing, same excuse, never showed up. Since I took the day off today to do this I decided to give them one last chance and made the final appointment at 6pm. I called them around that time to ask them a question and now a female says oh the technician can't show up today he's just too busy! I said are you serious? I've been sitting at home all day to do this? I was extremely angry at this time and told her so this is how you do business? This has been a horrific experience you put me through. To make it worse, she said, ok I'll find someone. Few minutes later this man calls and said, I'm right in your neighborhood and I don't know why they didn't call me this morning. Wow. He says I'll be right there! I'm thinking 20 mins to be fair. It took him over an hour and I had to call him to ask him if he was coming. He finally came and it got even worse, he was one of those salesman that wanted to sell you everything and didn't even care about what I had to go through today. He says I'm sorry but it's the company not my fault. Says how can you believe those groupon deals. You need to read those little small words on the bottom. He quoted me more than triple the price and said it went up because every closet is an additional room..even the small closets..as he went on and on. I knew it would be additional money but by that much? He quoted me almost 400.00.  And the attitude from this guy..My head was about to explode, I told him to leave! I had enough. When he finally left he blew up my phone until night time because I wouldn't pickup. I was tired and so drained. The manager called me the next day and left a message trying to make things better but I ignored it, I was so done.

The food is definitely good. I have tried the mussels (spicy and delish), the fried green beans (crispy and hot), the burger, fall salad (topped with a poached egg-yum), and the list goes on. I haven't had anything I didn't like, but there just wasn't enough to love! When I go out to eat, I want to indulge, or at least leave full, but they take the small plate thing very literally.

I was also just asking about  slot machines.  I guess it was good that they didn't care. More money for me to just keep in my pocket.
