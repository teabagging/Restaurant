Both were very good, especially the breading on the chicken sandwich (very light & crispy). This was not the typical chicken parm since it was a lighter version, which I liked a lot. The topping was the texture of salsa, very chunky & fresh. \\nMy husband said the burger was good with the fried jalapenos on the top; nice & spicy. He enjoyed it a lot. \\nApparently, all of the sandwiches come with potato chips. We, and a lot in our party, thought that this was fine if you go to a bar but for a nicer restaurant near Park Ave, it just didn't fit. Especially since they were served in snack sized bags (each person got his/her own). It just didn't feel right. You can trade in the potato chips for potato salad for $1.50 more or french fries for $2.50 more; this seemed pretty high for a lot of us (the french fries were steak fries which were frozen previously, so $2.50 was a high charge for a small portion for something you could do at home for a very small price). \\nSo basically you are paying $8 or $9 for a nice sandwich. \\n\\nThe one reason, though, why we and most people in our party will probably not go back was.....the service was terrible. Don't get me wrong: the waitress was more than pleasant and helpful, that wasn't the case at all. She was professional and very kind. But the food was incredibly slow coming out. I was the last one in our party to get my food (again, a party of 18) and the first people who got their food 20-30 minutes previously had already finished eating. This was a Monday for lunch and it didn't seem like they were busy with a lot of other customers (I think we more or less took over the place) so I don't know what it would be like if they were busy on a Saturday or Sunday. \\n\\nThe patio was very, very pleasant to have lunch in.

Not bad for an unassuming trailer parked in a convenience store parking lot. Not bad at all.\\n\\nJust standing in line- and there will probably be a line- is satisfying, as you are wrapped in the twirling smoke from the wood fire.

I've tried everything now and it's all good, but I recommend the beef brisket. That's just my personal fave, though- and on Sundays now, the beef brisket is organic, grass-fed, local pasture-raised beef slow smoked and served with a TO. DIE. FOR. slather-it-on-yerself sauce made with DogFish Head Ale. \\n\\nThe ribs are also amazing, you could gum all the meat off the bone without breaking a sweat- no teeth required for meat this tender. \\n\\nThe pulled pork is also good, but the least interesting meat to me in the general scheme of things.\\n\\nI won't really comment on the sides as I only tried them once way back in early spring, but I remember liking them quite a bit. Today, I went ALL MEAT, baby.\\n\\nThis place deserves awards, accolades, and cheerleaders- but they would feel a bit out of place here. Somehow, on the side of High St, for just a minute, you can almost think you're just lined up at some lost uncle's meat smoker, waiting for your turn to plate up.\\n\\nOf course, no uncle in my family tree ever made the best barbecue I ever tasted, so to Ray Ray's Hog Pit it is.

This place takes the expected stereotype and flips it on its head by producing outstanding brisket, trout, wild boar ribs (perhaps slightly drier than expected,but flavorfully impactful nonetheless).  The quail is perfectly smoked ...yet somehow juicy and the devilled eggs are devilish in the kick they provide to your taste buds.

Yes, it's nothing like what it used to be:  a charming, Tex-Mex restaurant with average food and an amazing view.  Now it's a huge tourist complex with average food & an amazing view.  I get it.  If you're here, you're here for the view.  If you want good food, downtown Austin in 30 minutes away.\\n\\nMy Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\\n\\nAtmosphere - The Oasis on Lake Travis has more of a theme park feel than a cozy restaurant.  There's now a huge multi-level parking complex, valet parking, shopping, and multiple restaurants/floors with live music on most nights.  Oh year, it also happens to overlook the west side of Lake Travis, meaning if you're here during the evening you may get a spectacular view.  I don't know how much I want to stress this, it's an awesome view.  And if you've come all this way, this is what you want to experience.  1 Star.\\n\\nService - I was here for a private party and we had a dedicated space with our own staff.  They were extremely nice and helpful, doing everything from managing the bar, coordinating dinner, and of course serving our dinner.  Not sure what service is like in the normal restaurant by my experience was great. 1 Star.\\n\\nFood - We had a catered dinner that consisted of a great, nicely seasoned shrimp cocktail along with a fried snapper with salad.  Who am I kidding, the food was good but not great.  Again, understand you're here for the view, and if you really are here for the food someone has tricked you.  1/2 Star.\\n\\nWill I Return? - Only with other tourists.  The Oasis on Lake Travis is a GREAT location to visit if you want to wow someone with a great view.  Throw in live music & a party atmosphere and it should make any tourist happy.

Keep that in mind if you ever visit.   1/2 Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

And, from 5-6:30, they have Happy Hour. Traditional rolls such as CA, spicy tuna, futomaki, shrimp tempura, avocado, etc. etc. are 1/2 price, which is $1.75-3.50 a roll! It really is a great deal. Plus, Bud and Bud Lights are $2 and the sake is $3. Really really good deal for a Japanese restaurant.\\n\\nAlthough I was curious about their sushi, we trekked it down to Moshi for their sukiyaki. We saw their menu in a local Columbus magazine and my husband went gaga for the prospect of having great sukiyaki with KOBE beef! Although the price of the dish seems hefty ($27), it had lots of filling and satisfying ingredients such as onions, nappa cabbage, mushrooms, scallions, tofu and udon noodles. It left both of us very satisfied. The presentation of the dish was great. It came in a casserole pot with all the fresh ingredients on top of a portable stove. The fresh meat was arranged around the marinade/broth in a very aesthetic manner. Once the broth started boiling, we dunked the beef in the sweet broth and savored every bite. I thought it was very good but my husband really wanted it in true Japanese fashion with a raw egg to drop into the broth. We figured it may be because of the risk of salmonella that they can't do this? All in all, the meal was good and the entire experience was great.

Nothing said fresh made bakery sweets.  It was very commercial :(.\\n\\nSecond the food itself:  \\n\\nThe chocolate mousse roll had only one enjoyable part the strawberry garnish.  I hate to be that harsh but I LOVE chocolate mousse and what I tasted there was certainly not that.  To top it off the cake was quite bland with a very off taste.\\n\\nThe lemon square my husband ate so I cannot comment on taste other then to say he really did not enjoy it [and lemon squares are his beyond favorite dessert].  I can however comment on the looks of it.  The curd was florescent yellow and was so gelatinous he pressed down to almost flat on the hard top crust and it sprung back up again without even splitting anywhere.\\n\\nThe Strawberry shortcake was very commercial in taste with what tasted like a canned strawberry pie filling in the center.  The bottom \\"graham cracker\\" like crust I have never seen on a Strawberry shortcake before was definitely not a welcome addition it was not very tasty.  Between the cake and the weird crust there was a custard like substance that again I have seen in a trifle application of a strawberry shortcake but never in a stand alone and was also quite unpleasant :(\\n\\nThe last thing was the Tart and that was the one and basically only thing their that my husband & I thought was kind of decent.  It had a nice cream and the fruit on top tasted fresh.  The Chocolate cup was of almost a bittersweet chocolate and tasty so I would say a thumbs up for them on that.\\n\\nIn total I can say I would definitely not go back there again!"},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"One of the best restaurants in Cambridge.

Unfortunately, the food was a bit substandard.\\n\\nI've been to this place twice now, mainly because it is convenient for me and I wanted to give it a try and a re-try.  Both times I visited, I was disappointed with the food and the restaurant itself.\\n\\nLets start with the restaurant decor.  The bar and the shelving behind it are made out of Home Depot store shelving... you know those orange metal things they stack water heaters and paint cans on?  Yeah.  Classy.  They did tape some kind of plastic brick facade over some of it, so it almost fools you into thinking it's actually made from legitimate building materials.  This chic, warehouse furniture scavenger appeal seems to flow through the entire restaurant.  I think that sums it up.\\n\\nNow, on to the food.  I usually go for beef burritos at these places, and they are usually a safe pick.  I'll have to say the quality was consistent, but that just means I didn't like it twice.  The sauce was watery, the beef was dry and had very little flavor, the rice was undercooked and hard and the flour tortilla was flat and dry (brittle around the edges).  There isn't much else that can go wrong with a burrito.\\n\\nI'll have to say, this place always seems to be busy.  I can't explain it and I gave up trying.  Maybe it is because so many people live very close and it's an easy place to meet up, but I feel that I can get my fill of everything that is unique about this restaurant by browsing the aisles at Home Depot.

It's not to say it's bad, it's just nothing to write home about. \\n\\nThe food is okay, they have decent wings and good entres and a decent selection of beer. None of the beer is anything too special, they stick to the usual brew pub variation. \\n\\nWhat I would say actually detracts from the experience is the service. I often feel like the servers are annoyed that they have to serve people. It's often, when you sit on the bar side, hard to get their attention and they often are short with you.

Doughnuts. Ever. Even at 10am, they were still making mini doughnuts nonstop, ensuring that each person gets a fresh batch.

My favorites by far were the apricot jelly and candied bacon doughnuts. It's not every day you can have a spicy apricot doughnut, and let's get real - who doesn't like bacon?! \\n\\nThe folks at Pip's are super generous, often giving you a baker's dozen. Life is so much sweeter with a freebie! Or two, since they also gave us a cinnamon sugar doughnut to munch on while we were waiting for our boxes of deliciousness.

Let me look on Yelp.\\n\\n[Intermission as I look]\\n\\n* Me: Oooooh, look! Bombay Caf√© has raving reviews and is only a 6 minute drive from where we are, let's do it!\\n\\n* Boy: Let's do it!\\n\\n____________________________________________________________\\n\\nUpon arriving we found this place nestled in between an Indian supermarket, Indian video/DVD store and Indian Photography Studio - I already knew this place was going to legit.\\n\\nBombay Caf√© itself is cute, dimly lit and we were greeted by a warm and friendly hostess who seated us, gave us menus and promptly had a waiter come over and bring us water. Service throughout our whole dinner was on point.\\n\\nAfter looking over the menu for quite sometime I couldn't find any of the super mild dishes that I normally order at an Indian restaurant (I don't do spicy, but enjoy spices) so waved our hostess/waitress over and asked her if they served Chicken Tikka Masala and she responded with, \\"No, we're a vegetarian restaurant\\"...\\n\\nI felt as if the entire floor had been wiped out from under me and I was going to drown in a prolific sea of spicy vegetables that I simply do not like :(. \\n\\nThe boy pointed out every potato based dish or anything that looks mild and slight not too crazy looking and I began to work up a sweat thinking that I might have to deal with just buttered na'an and white basmati rice for dinner...when I found it...all on my own... KHOYA KAJU - cashew nuts cooked in thick creamy sauce...I figured what could go wrong with nuts cooked in a thick creamy (ie. NOT spicy!) sauce right?\\n\\nWell what went wrong was NOTHING!! My Khoya Kaju was amazingly delicious, full of flavor and spices! It was a little spicy, but very mild and palatable nonetheless! \\n\\nThe boy ordered something that was super spicy with potatoes...don't remember what his dish was actually called but he loved it and what I tried of it was delicious and CRAZY spicy...just the way he likes it :).\\n\\nWe also ordered buttered na'an which came served with the standard chutneys (red, green and purple - that's all you're getting from me because I don't know their respective names, lol) and the green chutney was sooooooooo delicious. \\n\\nI also asked for a separate side of raita sauce which I poured all over my entr√©e dish along with spoonfuls of the green chutney - my food looked like a swirly mess of different colored sauces, but it tasted like a super exclusive party in my mouth in which only delicious spices were invited!\\n\\nSo SO happy we found this place! Bombay Caf√© is delicious, excellent service and super reasonably priced. Should I ever find myself in Orlando again I will totally make an effort to return here!

It's a \\"hipster\\" place, and I mean that in a nice and good way!\\n\\nSPACE:\\nThere's an area for working and eating. Outlets are available too, but there isn't too much space... Although I think you'll always manage to find a seat. I was there on a Monday from 1pm to 6pm, and it was never too crowded. There is also an outdoor patio area that is covered and fenced in with tables and chairs if you'd like to enjoy the fresh air, but knowing the cold Vancouver weather, you might want to wait until spring or summer before sitting outside. \\n\\nGROCERIES:\\nAs many have already mentioned, there is a section at the back packed with goodies that you could buy, both frozen and non-frozen: dumplings, chips, drinks, bread, you name it! There are shopping baskets to use if you were to buy a lot of groceries. \\n\\nFOOD:\\nThey have a breakfast menu that runs til 11am. There are plenty of vegetarian options too. They didn't have many selections for me (being on a no onion, no garlic diet), BUT they were so accommodating and offered to make something for me.  Didn't wanna be a hassle, so I just got a croissant sandwich, cheese herb scone, and a Jasmine tea.\\n\\nMy croissant was edible, but it was burnt ... They probably forgot about my poor croissant as it took quite a long time for it to come. This is the only downside of my entire experience here. I think they'd give you another for free if you asked for that, but hey, I don't like to complain about or waste food, so I just took it. :) \\n\\nThey are also very willing to top up on the hot water for my tea too! They checked up on me around two times? to see if I needed refills. The staff were busy at few times, so I went ahead to ask on my own, and they were super friendly about helping me.\\n\\nAlso! I'm not sure if they do this often since it was my first time there, but we were given FREE SAMPLES of HOT CHOCOLATE to try out! It tasted really good too. :)\\n\\nETC:\\nWashrooms are available for use, but you have to ask for the keys. I didn't use it, but my friend said it was really nice. ;)\\n\\nThere is a small basket to put wet umbrellas in, and no, my umbrella didn't get stolen for the entire 5 hours I was there. \\n\\nWe really enjoyed the music that was played in here. It was kinda like indie, retro, funk -- there was a healthy mix of \\"popular songs\\" (i.e. Calvin Harris - \\"Feels\\") and stuff that you never hear before (there was a Spanish song in the playlist). Disclaimer: I'm not good with music haha, so maybe the \\"never hear before\\" part only pertains to me. :p\\n\\nThere are multiple cute, tiny hooks outside to tie your pupper to if you need it. :D My friend commented on the hook's smallness, but I personally dunno if it's effective or not. Either way, it's cute and considerate for pet owners. :)\\n\\nThey have this cute plant named Becky that they take care of in here too! -- although I think they change up the plants every so often.

It's one of our favorite places to eat.  This location was actually the first one that we ever tried but it seems to have fallen down in quality in 2016 so we started going to New Albany and then Gahanna.  As with most fast food places, quality peaks and plummets based on the quality of the workers and since most fast food employees don't stick around long, quality varies.\\n\\nIt was the first day of school in Westerville and my wife and I wanted to pick up our daughter from school so we decided to go to this location.  This was absolutely the worst Chipotle food we have ever had.  It was so bad that if this was the first time that we had tried a Chipotle we would have never, ever eaten at any location ever again.\\n\\nIt started with my wife asking for a lid for her salad because she wouldn't be able to finish it.  As soon as they put the lettuce in the put the lid on and she didn't see it until we got to the table.  There was maybe 1 oz of chicken.  There was maybe enough lettuce to cover a white castle hamburger.  Most of the contents were the fajita mix.  Somewhat lucky for me, at least I thought so initially, was that I watched them make my chicken burrito and several times had to ask for more.  The lady in charge of the toppings apparently was planning on taking home any left over toppings because I had to ask for more three or four times on everything.  When I first asked for cheese she put on barely enough to fully cover a quarter.  It was ridiculous.\\n\\nBut the worst part of the entire meal for me, other than my wife being upset with her meal, was the quality of the chicken.  It was the dries, blandest chicken I have ever tasted.  I'll explain this in a way Chipotle fans will understand.  Do you know how when you are eating or have eaten a Chipotle chicken burrito, your hands retain the smell for hours?  That wonderful, smokey grilled chicken smell that normally hits you when you first walk in.  After eating my burrito, my hands had zero smell.  It was like I had eaten at a difference place.  Normally it takes lemon soap to get the smell off of my hands.\\n\\nLong story short, this location is a disaster.  I'm not sure if they just don't care because they are so busy, that they just don't care once school starts because they get so many high school students who are less discriminating or they just don't care because they don't care.  But this is by far the worst Chipotle location in Ohio.

The steak on top was perfectly cooked. For my main course, I opted for the chili relleno which was stuffed with corn, mushrooms, chili, and covered in cheese and sauce.

Their only lunch box is, again, overpriced for having only two raw items in it; it would be nice if they offered a few more lunchbox options.  I also love a simple udon or soba bowl accompanied by a roll or two, or a roll or sushi combo - but if you find spicy tuna a bit boring you'll be stuck with california roll.  Most of the other lunch specials are cooked, vegetarian, or combine fish that are uninteresting/unappealing to me (eg whitefish and octopus)... leaving me to wonder where the yellowtail or albacore is, since those seem to me like they would be popular items on a lunch menu for a restaurant that is almost always completely full for lunch."},{"name":"Mi Island Restaurant","address":"2137 N Courtenay Pkwy, Ste 28","city":"Merritt Island","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing.\\n\\nI had some reservations since we were just passing through town and it's a small place in a strip mall. \\n\\nThe owner greeted us, seated us and served us.

Take the whole subway eat fresh customize your meal thing and translate it for salads. Now put it in the pearl and allow customers to add things like green garlic, chimichurri, jicama, and crispy garbanzo beans and viola garden bar.\\n\\nThe salads are huge, the ingredients are top notch and surprisingly the staff are able to move the line along pretty quickly. Only couple complaints are that both locations are structured so you walk in the door and you are immediately in line so 2 or more people make the line go out the door. Possibly intentional to give it that long wait in line vibe people in Portland seem to love but when it's raining it gets old. The other complaint has nothing to do with garden bar.\\n\\nIf you customize your salad you get to choose 6 ingredients. Hint to patrons, if there is a line pick your ingredients before you get to the front don't start looking when they ask what you want. Also, while you get 6 ingredients if you pick 4 and feel pretty happy please don't spend 5 minutes hemming and hawing over your last two. Just walk away. You will love your salad without those last two ingredients and the person behind you won't be inclined to strangle you with grilled ramps.\\n\\nOh and yeah the prices are pretty decent for downtown lunches especially for the amount of food."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I came in right when they opened on Sunday.

However, the service we got during our December 2008 visit was so cold and unfriendly that it not only ruined our meal, it also made me revise my \\"I've never met an unfriendly Austinite\\" mantra.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nThe barbecue is super. I'm a most-of-the-time vegetarian who likes to splurge with some good 'cue once every year or two. With it's hearty portions of moist and flavorful meats--perfectly cooked to provide a contrast of smokey/salty/sweet flavors--my craving was definitely satisfied through 2009. We'd heard rave reviews about the mac and cheese and, while we thought it was good, it's uniqueness seemed to rely too heavily on its spice (jalapeno?)--the noodles were a few minutes past al dente and, amidst the cheese sauce, took on a sort of starchy mush texture that was still tasty, but not worth the stomach real estate that would have been better spent on other menu options--like my delicious seared chickpeas and goat cheese appetizer.\\n\\nThe Ambiance:\\nWe arrived for a 6:30 reservation and the place was only about a quarter full. The spacious dining room and lighting were cool, but reminded me of a Manhattan night club in that it feels sort of hollow and gloomy when there aren't a lot people to fill the space.\\n\\nAs we were leaving we went upstairs to use the restroom and there was an entirely different vibe. A live band was setting up and lots of fun-looking, diverse mini-crowds were laughing and seemed to be having a great time. If I came back, I'd head straight for the upstairs seating--and I'd come later in the evening (8:30-9:00) on a night when I knew there'd be more people.\\n\\nThe Service:\\nWe walked in the door with great anticipation and told the hostess we had a reservation for three. She looked at us as though to say \\"Are you idiots? You don't need a reservation--can't you see that we're pretty dead in here. Why are you bothering me with reservations?\\" She then coldly walked us to our booth and walked away. No prob, we thought, she's prob'ly just having a bad day. \\n\\nThen bad turned to worse: our waiter Shawn (? spelling) arrived. WHAT AN ASS! Right from the beginning he made us feel like we weren't welcome. He was grumpy, cold, and seemed to be doing his best to speak to us as little as possible. At first I thought it might be that he was homophobic and didn't like our table of three family guys. Then I watched closer as he went to another nearby table with a male/female couple and he was the same with them. Even the waiter's assistant was bleh--none of the staff in the entire restaurant smiled or seemed to enjoy their job. Lambert's was like Disney World in reverse--where everyone seems to be doing a job of making your stay unpleasant.\\n\\nI can't convey in words how unfriendly our waiter was. He had a passive-aggressive thing going on where he tried to do the bare minimum requirements of his job, and with the service you'd expect when you get a new driver's license at the DMV! We'd all lived in New York previously, so we're used to some pretty cold and callous wait staff. However, this guy beat the worst we've seen. And none of the other wait staff seemed much better. Right after we got our drinks and appetizers I mentioned to my friends that perhaps we should ask to see a manager so we could request a new server. We didn't, and in retrospect that was a big mistake.\\n\\nIn sum, Lambert's is a restaurant that clearly has invested all of it's talent in the back of the house--particularly on the grill. The front of the house needs a few dozen sessions on the therapist's couch--and perhaps some Donald Trump-ey \\"You're fireds.\\" Austin has more than its fair share of friendly people, I honestly don't know how Lambert's manages to gather so many rude employees into one space!\\n\\nNext time I'm in town I'll almost certainly head someplace else.

Staying the night to go to Kennedy Space Center before hitting the road again. \\nI looked on Yelp to figure out where to eat for my husband and our two kids. Being gluten free (me), it is always difficult to find good food where everyone is happy. 5 stars and over 35 reviews! I found my place! \\nWe drove back over the bridge and found it easily. Walked in, and were immediately greeted and sat. Got our drinks right a way and ordered for the kids. I was having trouble deciding on which tacos to order. They all sounded so tasty. The owner (I think) recommended the mahi tacos so I went with it. My husband ordered the Asian steak tacos and the kids got chicken tenders and a fish basket. \\nWhen the food was delivered, I was informed that the fries are made in a gluten free frier, so as long as I picked off the side not near the main course, I could steal some fries from my kids. Um, I don't get to do that often!  The fries were great! Perfect amount of salt and pepper, although my son thought it was too much pepper. \\nMy mahi taco was really good. Lots of favors fused together but nothing over powering. The mango, garlic, and cilantro in each bite was a perfect balance. I had ordered the Cole slaw, which was good. Not the typical sweet bbq style slaw, it was more of a vinegar base but so tasty. My husband had the Asian kale salad on the side. It was so great, I kept stealing bites of that too!\\nDessert was then offered and I was told they were all gluten free choices and all homemade. Um, heaven!! We chose three desserts- chocolate delight (small chocolate lava cake with chocolate ganache filling and vanilla ice cream on top), apple crisp (baked apple and oatmeal with vanilla ice cream), and cheesecake. All were so delicious! The chocolate was very rich (too rich for my chocoholic son but my 5 year old daughter ate most of it), Apple crisp was sweet and savory, and the cheesecake was light and fluffy (I only got one bite before my husband devoured it). \\nBefore leaving, the owner (I think) came back to the table to tell my kids a story about a dragon in the area and like the Pirates you cant leave the island without taking something.

To be honest, I visited the restaurant twice before writing this review so that I could experience each aspect of this venue.\\n\\nLocated in faux hell (AKA Atlantic Commons and boy is it common) SIDEBAR:  Why is all of Atlanta like one big 80's mall??  The entire city is like on gigantic suburb.  The neighborhoods have NO character!]\\n\\nThe restaurant is located on Central Park (original, right??) of this \\"development\\", with a nice patio.  Its open late and it seems as though the place turns into from a lounge to a bar the later the hour.  \\n\\nI strongly suggest making a reservation in advance.  The reservation can be made on www.opentable.com.  My first visit was on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy.  My second visit was on a Friday and it was a mob scene with people, with no reservation, waiting an hour to be seated. \\n\\nStrip is a pretty casual place.  Yet based on date & time you go it could be quiet or nosey.  If hitting on all cylinders and the moon & Sun are positioned properly, Strip is good for meeting up with friends, a meal after a movie or a place for a couple who've been dating for a while to have a meal. If you have kids you could bring them - the earlier the in the day the better.\\n\\nThe menu consists of standard salads, soups, burgers and various sandwiches.  I order a calamari, beef salad and grilled fish of the day and my dining partner ordered the crab cake, and ribs.  All those things were just marginal.  Then came the silver lining.  The Mac & Cheese!  Kids, its ALL about the Mac & Cheese!  It's the shiznit!!\\n\\nThe second time I went it was just for cocktails and to try the sushi.  I wish I hadn't.  It was boring.

At the average price of $2.50 each, the banh mi's are very tasty and a very good size and their veggies are sliced very thin so you get a subtle veggie flavor rather than lumps of it.  I also get the summer rolls which they call spring rolls a lot and they are $3.00 for 3 when you order take out but only 2 at the same price if you eat in.

I know it's a bad move to go when a place just starts up, but it looked neat, plus they had person dressed as a giant chicken dancing in front of the restaurant. Who can turn that down?\\n\\nWell, the dancing chicken was the best part of the meal. After we were seated, we didn't see our waiter for about 15 minutes. When he finally showed up, he seemed like were were bothering him. We ordered the smoked salmon benedict, and the spinach scramble (hold the bacon). What we got was a smoked salmon benedict that was covered in water. Like if they took the poached eggs out of the pan and immediately put them on the plate. The scramble had bacon. Our waiter didn't bring us the order, and he was no where to be found. He finally came around about 15 minutes after the food arrived to drop off the check (which we hadn't asked for). We tried to make the best of it. They give you a ton of potatoes, but most of the meal was crappy. However, we chalked the experience to them just having opened. One of the co-owners came by and we told him about what happened. He said he'd get our food redone if we'd liked, but this was near the end of what we were willing to eat. He didn't offer to compensate for anything, just a do over.\\n\\nFlash forward months later (although I'm surprised they're still in business). We again went for brunch on a Sunday. This time we stayed away from the benedicts and the scrambles. We opted for the biscuit beignets, the lobster omelet, the cinnamon roll french toast, and their fruit plate. This waiter was initially better than the one from our first visit. He came over right away, took our oder, and brought the food out...and was not seen for about 30 minutes when he brought the check (which we hadn't asked for, again). The biscuit beignets sucked as both biscuits and beignets. The lobster omelet was mainly cream cheese. If there was lobster in it, we must've missed it. The cinnamon roll french toast was burned on the plate down side. The fruit salad that they list as having \\"kiwi, strawberries, grapes, blueberries, apples, and oranges,\\" was mainly grapes and apples. After this, we thought what was the point in complaining.\\n\\nDon't even get me started about their coffee."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The first time I went to Massimo's was back in l996.  A friend of mine had been telling me about it for months.  We went one afternoon and he suggested the shrimp Margarita.  It was so good that when I got home to Wakefield later in the day all I could talk about was how good the food was.  And then I did something that I had never done and since have never done.  I took my ex there for dinner.  Twice in one day and I ordered the same dish again!  Fast forward 5 years and I was working for one of the thrash companies that serviced the North End.  We had 50-60 accounts in the area,  mostly restaurants and every business we dealt with had a short period of time to pay for their thrash pick-ups.  It's just the nature of the beast so to speak.  Thrash  is so expensive to get rid of.    Part of my job was to walk around the North End  on Saturdays and collect payment and keep everyone up to date.   One Saturday morning Mr Massimino and I were having a talk and we ventured out back to where he kept the thrash buckets that we had issued to him.  What I saw was amazing.  It was the cleanest thrash storage area that I had seen while working in the thrash business.  After his thrash was removed his help steamed the containers and all the area around them.  It was absolutely spotless and if you didn't see the buckets you would have thought it was just a tiny courtyard.  He then gave me a tour of the kitchen and again I was so impressed with how clean it was.  Talking with him left a lasting impression in my mind about something to look for when going to a restaurant.  If an owner is willing to keep his/her restaurant spotless inside and out (and that means the restrooms also) then there is a good chance your off on the right foot eating there.  Very few people realize how much heavy thrash and garbage a restaurant generates and how important it is to get it removed quickly so as not to create a rodent problem.  Keep this in mind when dining out.  If you can see or smell thrash so can rodents.  One last thing.  If your new to the area or even someone who has been around a long time don't be afraid of finding a parking space in the North End.  Massimino's is near the skating rink side of the North End and there is parking available most of the time as long as you time your visit when the Bruins and Celtics aren't playing."},{"name":"Karma Taco","address":"1620 E Riverside Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have been eating at Karma Taco since they moved to their current, Riverside location.

Goi cuon were good and seemed freshly made, though I think they included chicken instead of the typical pork. The pho was decent, not the best I've had but not bad either. Good amount of beef (though I would've preferred more bite-sized pieces instead of the large ones), plentiful veggie/herb garnishes, and decent broth.\\n\\nService was fine, perhaps could've been a bit more attentive, but it was pretty typical of any pho place.

It wasn't crowded when we sat and she took our order, so why my husband had to ask when we could expect our food - twice - I'll never know. It was a blistering hot day (97 degrees, what felt like 100% humidity) and we had to keep asking for refills of water and drinks  (iced tea for us adults, apple juice for the toddler) and waited over 20 minutes each time. I mean, send an assistant over with my water and tea, ok? \\n\\nThe burger was described as piled with crab and lobster - no mention of this gross, nasty cream sauce the burger arrived swimming in. Plus it was raw. Not medium rare - absolutely red in the center, cold to touch, I'm afraid to eat this raw. So they exchange this for a filet. Nice enough except I was clear it needed to be put on priority in the kitchen because we had already waited an exceptional amount of time for our meals. Oh, and proving my suspicions about our food order going in late, our daughter's grilled cheese was stone cold. Yeah, that sat a while. Twelve to fifteen minutes later my filet arrives, goes what RAW. Not medium-rare - RARE - absolutely cold in the center. I was actually nervous to eat it, thankfully it was large so   I could eat the edges because by that point I just wanted to run as far away as I could. Adding insult to injury the meat was tough. I've had better beef from our local butcher at $10 per pound not $50 a meal. My husband's rib eye was very fatty, I know it's a marbled piece of meat but it looked like the kitchen didn't both to check the fat around the outside. \\n\\nThe manager eventually wandered by to 'check on our satisfaction?'. Simply said I wasn't, which he pressed. REALLY? You came over because we complained and sent food back - don't pretend you're shocked.

However, this is the second time my service has been rude. I don't need anyone to be sweet or even nice while assisting me when I go out to eat, but rudeness is just unnecessary. Yesterday, me and my friend had to wait way too long to order, literally had the waitress skip over us to ask others how their food was doing even when we had our food already, I had to ask for my drink to be brought thirty minutes after ordering it (which is fine normally but in this context is important to note), the waitress did not fill my water at all throughout the meal and when she did at the end it was like not even a quarter full. My friend and I were actually laughing at that point because it was sadly a bit comical. I've worked in service before and I understand if it's really busy or if someone's having a bad day but this experience was in a league of its own. We could clearly see a brightened demeanor with other patrons and not with us. No clue why, we were going out of our way to not be obvious about our issues.

Overall, food and service were both on par, but knocked a star off due to the long wait and being asked to move 3 different times while waiting (not much room to wait inside if it's raining outside)."},{"name":"Salt Lick 360","address":"3801 N Capital of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The barbeque was disappointing.

A lamb belly bacon garnished on top! I wanted to lick the bowl, but I didn't think it was appropriate. The main course was a chicken curry over a rice pilaf, garnished with edibles I've never seen before and fried duck skins (I hate Curry)...again, wanted to lick the plate. Dessert was just your run of the mill cake and ice cream, except soaked in an amazing liquor and the ice cream was a spiced gelato with a sort of biscotti style crumbly goodness cake. \\n\\nAsk to be paired with a wine for your meal, you probably won't know what she has because it may not be listed.\\n\\nI had ordered a coffee...I call it crack in glass...of course she has a guy that ships her Colombian coffee direct in small batches...the cup was a small cup but it was flavored like an espresso and perfectly sweetened with tine layer of a cream that made it the best cup of coffee I've ever had.

Not knowing anything about this place beforehand, my experience was mediocre... at best.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, not all dining-ware was placed on the table beforehand.  There were five chairs, but only three sets of plates, silverware, and glasses.  We had to ask our server to bring us the rest of the missing items, and even then, we still did not get the last set of silverware, so I had to offer my fork to my boyfriend in order for him to eat his steak.  Not a huge deal, but when I pay $40+ for my meal, I'd expect some silverware!\\n\\nI ordered three sushi rolls:  the Dynamite, the Spicy Salmon, and the B-52.  The server took a reasonable amount time taking our orders, but the timing for the food to come out was just terrible.  My four other friends got their food about ten minutes earlier than I did, and by the time my food finally came out, they were already over halfway done with their meals.  As for the actual food, it was definitely not worth the price.  I'm not sure if they even season their sushi rice properly, because it was as bland as it comes.  Two of my rolls were raw rolls, but the meat quality seemed less than average-- there was no \\"sea\\" taste to my sashimi pieces at all.  My tray was not served with wasabi or pickled ginger like my friends' were, even though I ordered the most number of rolls.  The only good thing worth mentioning about the food, is how the kitchen took the effort to cut one of our steaks in half, because we mentioned that it was going to be split between two of us.  The steak itself, which I had a bite of, was cooked, more or less, correctly, but had no seasoning at all.  It was served with sauce on the side, which was also, again, very bland.\\n\\nApart from our server forgetting the last piece of silverware, he was very nice, attentive, and even split our checks five-ways.  Overall, this would probably be an OK place to grab a bite, if you're willing to pay extra for just OK food.  I think if you're going to a restaurant that specializes in three big categories (sushi, steak, and seafood), you're probably going to be left with mediocre food-- kind of like a jack-of-all trades, master of none sorta deal."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My family were in town, and we came here for dinner.

It's actually on the same street where one of the earliest Korean restaurants in Boston was, right across from the Green Line T stop. However it just wasn't anything special, and now there's noticeably more competition than the other restaurant (now long gone) faced.\\n\\nProblem: rather inattentive service and mediocre food unfortunately. banchan: four little dishes-- an odd sweet pickled green bean(?), kimchi, and two watercress dishes, one of which was actually ok, if a little odd. My ibimbap was small, uninspired, and sort of bland, but at least it was served with kochujang as usual. It's not really anything better than I could've cooked up myself-- and that's just not what I'm looking for when I got out to eat!\\n\\nThe other diners around didn't seem to be very knowledgeable; I heard one guy asking for his rice to be cooked with \\"meat juice\\" but then asked for teriyaki sauce. no wonder the waitress was confused! so I guess they don't need to have a very high bar to cater to their clientele. So while I don't fault them for not knowing about Korean food, it may be lowering the standard for those who do know.\\n\\nMy wife suggested \\"sap poor oh\\", but I'd just call it \\"subpar-o\\". sadly I'm not coming back. My daughter said, \\"I wanted to go to the Indian restaurant!\\"-- and she doesn't even like Indian food really.\\n\\nOh! I also took a picture of the little card where they asked for 1. cash tip 2. $25 minimum (i don't think this is allowed by visa/mastercard rules) 3. visa/mastercard in preference to amex. So i paid with my credit card (i don't have amex) and put the tip right on there. what a buzz-kill (not that there was much of a buzz) to have to read this after my rather disappointing meal.\\n\\nAll in all I'd say it's probably 1.5 stars, but I'll go to 2 stars here, giving them the benefit of the doubt; the 4 and 5 star ratings here are surprising, but de gustibus non disputandum est, i suppose. \\n\\noh yeah, there's a tiny little outdoor seating area, but did I mention that this is below street level and it's much like sitting in a... grotto?

When it came to handing out our entrees, we were waiting for everyone to receive their food before we ate. We had to wait a very long time because one girl did not receive her food. And we only got Sarah's attention when she came back to (flatly) ask us how our food was around 5 minutes later. Obviously, nobody had started to eat as she Sarah had forgotten to bring it out that entree. Mistakes like that can happen though so that point can slide. But it's Sarah's attitude to it the whole time and lack of apology. Plus, there had been specific instructions to bring out the salad dressing on the side and that had been disregarded.\\n\\nNow to the food. I had the top sirloin. Wow... was it ever chewy... And the plating was pretty atrocious. Definitely not worth the $23+. Other guests who had ordered the salad looked like they had a bunch of green leaves on their white plate and then five slices of chicken shoved off on one of the corners - exactly what you'd expect at a fast food chain to only pay $6 for. Very carelessly delivered. It actually looked like guest was sharing a salad with another guest at that table and they literally cut the salad in two and plated it like that. (Salads should be in bowls!)\\n\\nAnd at the very end, she short-changed me 80 cents. I'm obviously not going to ask for petty change back, but seriously - why do I want to give you 80 cents more than your 15% auto gratuity on your awful service?\\n\\nDefinitely not a happening restaurant. It was a Saturday night and this Robson st. restaurant is only full with 3 large parties (two of them were full of 15 year olds) and a very few number of walk-ins - a huge sign of how unpopular they are as I'm sure the other similar restaurant chains were much more busy. I don't understand how this restaurant is staying alive with such terrible service, extremely mediocre food and dismal atmosphere. It's almost like their adult customers are either tourists who don't know better or those who don't want to wait the line at like Cactus, Joeys and even Milestones.

The rates are higher then, but the experience will be worth it"},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best brisket hands down!!!

For starters, we were welcomed by an energetic and friendly staff. First impressions can should never be underestimated. Second, the menu was interesting. Many mouthwatering options. Third, our waiter, Justin, was enthusiastic, well versed on the menu and attentive. He was everything you would expect from a waiter and then some. If you are fortunate to get Justin, leave him a good tip! Forth, the chips kept coming. Fifth, the Pollo Perfecto, a braised and then flash fried chicken leg topped with a rich, fragrant and most tasty mole was finger licking good. Really! I gave up the knife and fork and used my fingers. After all God gave us fingers and hands before forks and knives Sixth, the decor was inviting and warm. Not over done, but simply enough.  Finally, our 12 year old and self proclaimed foodie enthusiastically said he would like to return. The only downside, was the noise level.

The food is seriously delicious and we love everything we have tried. However, this review is more about cross contamination that we've experienced twice now from their food. I have a very, very serious cashew allergy. One or two of their menu items have cashews, so on my first visit I alerted them and asked if there could be any crossover into their non cashew dishes; I was assured no-- there is no way. We ask every time and always alert them as to the seriousness of my allergy. About a year ago I got really sick after a dinner there (lips swelled, throat closed, vomiting) but I hadn't actually seen a cashew so I thought perhaps I had been exposed to something else. Last night in a takeout order though, halfway through my tikka masala, I found two whole cashews. I had to take a triple dose of Benadryl and use my epi-pen to avoid my airway closing.

And no small forks were brought with this dish, requiring us to awkwardly dip our dinnerware into the horseradish, etc - presentation was off. \\n\\nOn to the entrees - we both ordered steaks, cooked medium, and three very easy vegetables to share. It took this a full hour to arrive. My steak was more mid-rare, and my husband's was well-done. We didn't say a word about it because we didn't have another hour to kill. A word about this food runner - my steak arrived with an au poivre sauce that I did not order due to a severe gluten allergy (noted in our reservation). I asked him to take the sauce back to the chef to verify that it was gluten free. Five minutes later, he returns and declares (loudly), \\"uhhhhh - chef says it probably has gluten in it, so don't eat it\\". Probably?? The chef doesn't know if he adds flour to a sauce?! \\n\\nBrussels sprouts were oily, not lightly crisped. Roasted vegetables were not fully cooked.

Located on A Street near Lucky's, Blue Dragon moved into an old, small establishment which once housed a Southie diner and immediately upon opening became a celebrated hit with locals and suburbanites alike.\\n\\nVery different from the high end Blue Ginger, Blue Dragon calls itself an Asian Gastro pub.   The dinner menu offers traditional Asian fare of dim sum and noodles and American comfort food such buttermilk fried chicken with a bit of a twist.\\n\\nI had been dying to go since the day it opened to see if all the hype I was hearing was true.  One bit of hype is definitely true and that is the extremely long wait times for tables.  I had stopped by twice before only to be told there would be an approximate wait of almost two hours.  Returning a third time last Saturday at 6.30pm, I truly thought the wait would be much shorter.  Sadly, we were told an hour and 45 minutes.  I was prepared for the wait having had a late lunch.  We decided to go and hang out at the bar and enjoy an early evening cocktail. \\n\\nThe bar and restaurant was absolutely packed.  I feel people must go at 4pm and just not leave!  I decided to ask at the bar if there was also a waitlist for bar dining and was told there was.  I put my name in and 10 minutes later, we were lucky enough to nab two seats, much to the annoyance of others who didn't get to put their names in.  I was thrilled at getting this prime real estate.\\n\\nEvery bit of Blue Dragon's casual, small space is utilized with seating.  Window seating, low table seating, bar seating, a high top table that runs down the middle of the restaurant as well as dining along the open kitchen.  Blue Dragon has a fun, loud vibe and a cool mix of clientele from the young hipsters to the mature suburban crowd.  It seems everyone wants to try this place out and I can see why.\\nThe cocktail menu looks really interesting with fun named cocktails like Bangkok Sunrise and Year of the Pig.  They also offer draft wines, which I thought was a cute idea.  I really should have tried one of the cocktails but instead both my friend and I opted for the Simonnet Febvre Sauvignon Blanc.  I do have to say that their pours are very small, surprisingly so.  I had three glasses throughout the evening and I am not sure they amounted to one full glass.  \\n\\nThere were so many things on the dinner menu that we wanted to try.  Everything is reasonably priced from $5 snacks to $12 noodle bowls.  I loved the fact that you can have lots of different \\"tapas\\" sized dishes and share.  Perfect for us!\\n\\nWe started with some dim sum of Shrimp Shumai and Pork and Scallion Wontons.  I was a big fan of both of these delicious dishes.   I especially loved with the Pork and Scallion Wontons with its salty pork and sweet scallion.\\n\\nFabulously sticky Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs were up next.  Perfect bite sized ribs, which should not to be eaten on a first date, far too messy but oh so good.  One of my favorites of the evening.\\n\\nA rich heady small skillet of Escargot in butter made for a kick of intense wonderful flavors.  Even better when we mopped the butter up with the brioche toast.\\n\\nA complete 180 of the escargot was a delicate tasting of Hamachi Carpaccio.  Beautifully presented razor thin fish with creamy pureed avocado and crusty bread, really tasty.\\n\\nTo be honest I was already so full but we had one more dish of Pad Thai to come.  A bit of a different take on the traditional Pad Thai, this one is made with scallops and bacon.  Sadly, this was my least favorite of all the dishes.  I absolutely love spicy food, however, this was so incredibly spicy I couldn't really taste the flavors of the dish itself.\\n\\nI happily ended our meal with the last of the ribs, while my friend finished up the Escargot. \\n\\nOverall, I really like Blue Dragon and of course, I love the fact that we have another cool restaurant in Southie.

Was sad to say, it was a little disappointing. We've been to the other two locations in Austin and absolutely love Hopdody's, but tonight we left feeling a bit sour after our experience. The location is great and the atmosphere is fun. The workers there are very kind and friendly. But friendly doesn't mean good. Maybe because it's the first week of opening and there a few things that need ironing out, but we've had several mishaps tonight. \\n\\nFirst, we were given the wrong table number. Someone was already sitting at the table we were assigned and it was a bit difficult to hunt down someone to correct this issue. The girl we found was very apologetic and helpful so no big deal. Things happen. It's cool. Next, our fries came out cold. They still tasted okay, but it was frustrating not being able to flag someone down to ask them about this since everyone was busy zipping all around us and not actually near us. Fine. It's cool. I understand it was busy and probably hard to keep track of everything. At least the burgers would be good right? Wrong. I asked for my Buffalo Bill burger med rare and got med well. I'm thinking, okay, maybe the cashier just misheard me. The burgers didn't taste like I remember either. I love going to Hopdoddy's because the burgers are always just phenomenal, but this one didn't impress me. It lacked flavor on top of being overcooked for what I wanted. My sister also said hers tasted different and just okay. Ugh, by this point we were just sorely disappointed with our meal and wanted to pay and go home, but of course that was when our server disappeared and we didn't see him the rest of the night. I had to flag down two different people, one to check out and another to get a togo container. I decided not to complain because I just don't like to do it. I've worked in the service industry for a while and I know how hard it can be so I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurants, but it was hard to bite my lip tonight. Maybe I shouldn't have? Oh well. Too late now. Yelp will have to do.\\n\\nIt really makes me feel sad to have to leave a review like this because I had really high expectations for this place! I definitely will be back to give it a second chance especially since it's so close to me. The people there are super friendly and are helpful once you can get their attention.

In Hyde Park, graduated with honors and THOUGHT I was going to cook, but I fell in love with the \\"front on the house\\". It has been an incredible asset to my career to have gone through what the guy on the line does daily. It enables me to call \\"bs\\" when a chef/cook tries to feed me incorrect information because I  understand the processes of cooking. I have also had the good fortune, in my 20 year career, to work with six different Mobil 5star chefs, four different Michelin starred chefs, led as GM three different restaurant openings in 3 different states(most recently Manhattan). I have over a decade of General Management experience in restaurants ranging from 3 million to 11 million per annum. \\n\\nNOW \\n\\nI don't say all of this to be arrogant, pompous, or a braggadocio. Honestly, I was so pleasantly surprised today by Superica that I felt it merited distinguishing myself from the usual \\"yelp reviewer\\"; the ones that has an axe to grind or have ZERO idea what they are talking about (without any thought given to how their harsh words online, over minutiae that is meaningless, will effect the employees of said restaurant.

Mr. Fry may make you feel like you are in an environment that will be included on the bill, but it isn't. He definitely knows what \\"value for dollar\\" means. \\n\\nThe ONLY criticism I have of the restaurant is that I was never really sure who our server was, but I had everything I needed when I needed it or wanted it, so really that's just a personal preference of mine. \\n\\nNow I get it.

He's a fascinating man and educator, and I've enjoyed and salivated over his cooking shows. \\n\\nBlue Dragon is on the site of the eponymous A St. Diner, which held position there for decades when the district was a commercial business enclave. You could get a comfort food breakfast and lunch. My family business was a short walk down A St. for 53 yrs. I feel very close to the neighborhood. \\n\\nMy visit late on a Saturday night was well timed. I got a table quickly, yet the restaurant was full of patrons. Ming himself had on an apron and was delivering food and seeing after the room. There appeared to be plenty of staff. I passed on sophisticated alcohol choices, and moved to have a couple of menu choices I felt good trying. Mini Bison burgers served with cooked onion and shiitake mushroom on a commercial burger bun, like a Pepperidge Farm. I added an order of Dan Dan noodles. These were toothsome and appropriately chewy. A meat sauce preparation topped it and instructions to stir it all up was offered. \\n\\nIn short, food was a disappointment, especially at these prices. The overriding issue was sodium. The food was all bathed in salt and it was more like a salt lick experience. I don't know how Chef Tsai doesn't see this... The saltiest food I've had in a long time. Both dishes were afflicted by this over abundance of salt. The burgers themselves seemed fine... But the serving of fries was intensely salted. The fries were covered in grains. I complained and at a late moment in the meal I was brought another portion, which proved to still resonate with sodium!! Without the granules on the fries, I wondered how this was possible... And the answer I got was that they brined there potatoes. So now the potatoes had an average patina of salt. Ok. No compensation was offered upfront for the discord in my meal. \\n\\nThe Dan Dan noodles also suffered from too much salt. This prep lacked the sweet peanut sauce style and was a thinner, savory, Szechuan peppercorn variant. It's admittedly lighter eating, but in all it wasn't worth eating again. I was underwhelmed. \\n\\nFinal thoughts: this may be an It place to try, but I'll return to the leader in this Asian casual comfort food category next time, Myers & Chang, nearby in the South End. Cuisine that is creative, well executed, satisfies, and is not a salt bath for your tongue. There I've not had a bad meal over several years of dining.

I walked into here right after finishing a disappointing cannolo at Mike's and was immediately relieved to realize two things - one, that they offer mini cannoli (there was no way in hell I could eat a whole one at this point) and two, that they fill them to order. I was not so relieved that the line was longer than it was at Mike's but hey, I was taking one for the team.\\n\\nBecause they fill each one separately (not to mention that they go to kitchen in the back to do this), the line moves rather slowly. Still, if you're not willing to wait for quality cannoli, you probably shouldn't be eating them at all. Plus, while you wait you can gaze at all the rest of their gorgeous treats - they have creme brulee for $3.25! Where else can you find that? You can also admire the store's stylish interior - of the three bakeries I've visited so far on this tasting mission, this one is definitely the hippest.\\n\\nI got two mini cannoli - one with ricotta, one with vanilla custard. They didn't really have to wrap my tiny order in a box, but their boxes are so cute and slightly less embarrassing for a local to be carrying than Mike's, so I didn't complain. There were no open seats so I decided to take my cannoli-eating and tourist-watching over to my old pal Paul Revere a little ways down Hanover Street.\\n\\nThe ricotta was so good. I may be wrong, but I think I sensed a hint of orange zest which totally sealed the deal. The custard was less amazing. Maybe I should have eaten this one first and it was just overshadowed by the ricotta, but at the end of the day, I've made better custard. The shells were definitely better than Mike's but not as good as Maria's. At $1.50 a pop they were a little expensive for their size, but I'll cut them some slack since they were super fresh and it was nice getting to try two for $3.\\n\\nSo, the current definitive North End rankings are as follows:\\n1.

So, when it turned out that their hotel was a block away from Green Lettuce, I knew that I had to try it out. I had been hearing about it for months as a great vegetarian-friendly joint, and I knew that my parents wouldn't protest, so I called in a reservation (thanks Yelp for letting me know it'd be busy even on a Sunday night) and off we trundled.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, they hadn't exactly set aside a table for us, which was weird, but we were seated pretty quickly and after that, the service was quick and helpful. The menu is separated into sections, one of which is vegetarian, so I felt pretty safe ordering things that would suit me. We ordered three vegetarian dishes and two meat dishes (including ginger beef, of course), and all five of us ate until we were sweating and stuffed. My parents loved the food and so did I.\\n\\nNothing was overwhelmingly amazing - I can't really remember details at this point, though I probably got something with eggplant, because that's my steeze.

Portions are small but ample. The starter plate with a variety of spreads was delicious but could have used another naan style serving to match the three spreads we ran out of bread. The cavatelli special was good but didn't match the farro risotto with a poached egg. WOW, that was incredible. I would go back just for that dish. Both of our main dishes came served in a bowl that was a lot like a cereal bowl, nothing fancy. I was expecting a wider-rimmed plate like the website showed. \\n\\nDrink Specials: Cocktails are super creative and the waitress was incredibly skilled in describing them with illustrative adjectives, too. I have no idea who would order a 1.5L serving of red wine for $450. It's on the menu and I am not sure why.

Some seat cushions along the wooden bench would help for comfort. Cushions are in the window area but the bench along the wall begs for additional comfort.

It tasted very fresh with no added sugar to it. We ordered the Dungeness Crab Cake Egg Benedict ($14.95) and Smoked Salmon Scramble ($11.95). Both were super yummy. The pouched egg was perfectly cooked with the runny yolk inside. The scramble egg was tasty. However, it didn't have much salmon inside. I can see the price is a little higher in Portland's standard. But comparing to the Bay Area, it is okay for us. Also the portion was huge that kept us full almost of whole day.

When you operate in certain creative circles, you are sure to run into people you know at the usual hangouts. But sometimes you are working on a plan, idea, startup or brainstorm you don't want overheard by your crowd. You don't even want them to know who you are meeting with, know what I'm saying? This is a place where Julian Assange could meet with Mark Zuckerberg and no one would find out. So if you have a big plan you don't want to get back to your Etsy rivals, the ad agency types or the paparazzi this is the lunch spot to talk.\\n\\nI'm on a quest for African food, including Ethiopian, Somalian, Kenyan, Eritrean and the food of Djibouti - North East Africa. Horn of Africa has a unique take with their lunch buffet; a mix of what I would consider North East African and what I would consider Indian.\\n\\nSo this place combines both ideas, a private place to meet with tasty food and it is very inexpensive. \\n\\nThe buffet, when I stopped by, had a healthy looking salad of lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives and red onions. \\n\\nThere was a sauted onion pepper chicken dish, berbere ground beef with peas, collards - not overcooked, a coconut turmeric hominy, potato-carrots, organic navy beans in a yellow sauce and sibling organic lentils in a red sauce and a few other dishes. There was a saffron biryani rice and injira. Indian condiments accompanied including chutneys - not the sweet type - and Indian pickle.\\n\\nUnique was the berbere goat. It has some tomato in addition to the spices, and bones as clearly stated on a note by the dish. I think first time goat for me. It's game-y a little chewy and works well with the spices.\\n\\nI spent some time talking with the family who own and operate the restaurant. We talked about spices. We talked a lot about goats. What they eat, anything, but they relish blackberries. Their love of climbing. I learned, though I thought goats were not too bright, that they respond to their name and know their goat family. Yes they are stubborn. I guess goats have selective intelligence. The owner used to process goats to meat in a previous location, and reports that goat livers are a high demand item. You are not going to get that much goat intelligence elsewhere in Portland. We talked about East African farming and farm animals. I learned that ostrich oil is a great treatment for muscle pain and skin ailments. Wow!\\n\\nI've been for just lunch. All you can eat lunch.

Nicely smoked, perfectly sauced, and even cut into single bones for us.  The sauce was delicious, and the meat was tender but firm.  They were clearly the \\"winner\\" of the day.\\n\\nThe pulled pork sandwich was great.  A great amount of meat, good roll, and lots of delicious sauce.  Yum.\\n\\nThe brisket was \\"ok\\".  Mine was a bit dry, but still quite tasty.  The least impressive entree of the three, in my opinion.  Maybe it was just an off day?\\n\\nThe mac n cheese was also \\"ok\\" ... a little too yellow-american-cheese for me, but that's a personal preference.  \\n\\nThe potatoes were quite good.  In fact, they give my mom's (rest her soul) recipe a run for its money.\\n\\nThe greens were actually a bit spicy.  My husband and I prefer a more \\"wilted spinach with pork drippings\\" type experience, but these had a bit of a kick to them.  Don't get me wrong, they were quite tasty.  But they just weren't our speed.\\n\\nThe main reason I didn't give the full five stars?  As we stood in line for an agonizing 51 minutes (yes, I timed it), we watched a guy pull up in a restored sports car.  He waited until one of the employees came out of the truck, slipped them some cash, and cut the line.  She went in, got his order, handed it to him, and said \\"have a nice day\\".  Not cool.

It seems like a difficult process to truffle eggs, and they still taste good, so I don't hold it against them, but they should be more honest in their menu regarding that. \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend their pasta, however (which is why I only gave them 4 stars). I feel like the quality of their pasta and sauces are on-par with someplace like Olive Garden - not really worth the prices here and not as good as the other options you could get here. Everyone I've gone with who has ordered the pasta has been underwhelmed.  I come from an area of the country where traditional Italian pasta is very important though, so I might be a rather harsh critic in this regard.\\n\\nAlso, I noticed some people FROM OUT OF TOWN complaining about the service not being friendly enough... well, I never had a problem with it before, but probably thanks to folks like them, now it's too friendly!

At first approaching our feel was this is NOT a kid friendly place, and it isn't. If you have small ones you know the experience of entertaining, feeding and enjoying a meal is a hardship when you're not in your comfort zone. My kid went bananas. There were mirrored walls to smear food on, places to run, a paper kids menu and some balls on wire to keep her occupied. Nothing out of the ordinary of any restaurant. The biggest problem was the tiny table we were seated at, it was intended to seat 4 but barely fit the 2 of us and a child.\\nThe food was okay.  My turkey sandwich was on the severely dry side of the turkey world, macaroni salad came with it.  I have never been a huge fan of macaroni salad, and theirs furthered my opinion, as I am never going to like macaroni drenched in relish and mayo. Not appetizing.  Maybe the food is home-style Midwestern?  My Kansas bred husband confirmed it was not his favorite either.  He had a tuna sandwich, which was typical shredded tuna and mayo.

In my opinion, challah is the perfect bread for French toast, and it was grilled perfectly.

I would also highly recommend ordering the fresh seasonal fruit on the French toast.\\n\\nThe roasted potatoes were cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were crisp on the outside and seasoned uniquely.

The place is usually packed with students studying or locals stopping by for a cup of coffee. 95% of the items I had tried here are great. All of the coffee drinks I have tried (regular coffee, mocha, latte) have been very flavorful and reasonably priced. They also make a mean hot chocolate, which could just be powdered hot chocolate, but who cares? \\n\\nThe breakfast sandwich is probably the best I have ever had. They use soft brioche bread and cook the egg perfectly with lots of melted cheese, and you can add your own toppings. The quesadilla (a recent addition to the menu) is delicious, however I noticed they have been making the quesadillas smaller and smaller recently. Another standout is the hummus and veggie wrap; very generous portion filled with lots of fresh vegetables and overall very tasty. \\n\\nMy one critique is that their baked goods are almost always under-baked. While they are supposedly famous for their pie, the underside the piecrust is almost always doughy. I have also ordered muffins and cakes that are totally doughy in the middle, to the point I will not eat them. Usually the chocolate chip cookies are outstanding and delicious, but occasionally I get an under-baked one and don't want to eat it. \\n\\nI should also mention that the staff has a great attitude and always seems to remember regular customers, of which I am one. This is a very fast-paced coffee shop, which must get exhausting, but the staff delivers great service and seems to enjoy working at Petsi Pies.

As mentioned earlier everything they do tastes great, but their signature dishes for brunch in my opinion are the Biscuits and Gravy and their Eggs Benedict.

Everybody in a 100 mile radius knows how wonderful this spot is, so plan on getting there early.

The house sauce was a little too sweet for me, but the hot sauce hit the spot. The brisket would have been absolutely exceptional if it weren't for the few slices of overly fatty brisket... I prefer the leaner cuts. I'm just excited to taste all the entrees and try out the 15 or so a la carte side dishes... but I feel the brisket will be my default choice in the long run.\\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, it has a Texas BBQ charm with an upscale air. The place was crowded, but not cramped... and after dinner we went upstairs for a drink.. and two guys were playing some hillcountry songs on their guitars.. while people were starting to usher in to the open area. Now that I think about it.. this place kind of reminds me of Stubb's in concept, but much nicer.\\n\\nOverall, the staff was young, fun, and cool, the food was fantastic, the ambiance was surprisingly lively, the decor was of a somewhat classy Texas theme housed in a historic building, and the location while a few blocks away from the other bars.. I suspect will be quite a hot-spot once the condos and the W surrounding it get built. I have a feeling the wait will only get longer here... which is fine with the large entertaining upstairs area.   \\n\\nI highly suggest this place... although for some the pricing might seem a bit high.. expect to pay at least $50 for a meal for two."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Great brunch!

I really can't recall there being such a line when I was younger; definitely doesn't seem like they're suffering from the bad economy.\\n\\nThe line was daunting at first but moved quickly.  Basically once you get inside, you line up to individual servers, as opposed to one gigantic line and then going to an open server.  I was a bit annoyed because the girl who I was waiting for just disappeared for more than a few minutes and I had asked another server where she was, and she curtly replied that she WAS coming back...a few minutes later still no sign.  And then a guy walked right up to the rude-ish woman and she helped him right away.  WTF?  She KNEW I had been waiting in line and she was free, yet purposely chose NOT to serve me?  AND had attitude?  I had a large order and would have appreciated getting served as soon as possible so I could get out of there.  When I was younger, I remembered that there were a lot of old ladies behind the counter who were deftly efficient and skilled at getting you your pastries and wrapping the boxes with the string at lightning speeds.  I noticed these younger women were a bit slower at that too, so that just annoyed me even more.\\n\\nAnyway, the main attraction are the cannoli, which to this day are still amazing.  They have a plethora of flavors including chocolate dipped, chocolate chips, pistachio, mocha, hazelnut, amaretto, etc.  The fried pastry shell is perfectly crispy and not over fried and the ricotta filling is just like this perfect fresh dairy flavor.  One per person is more than enough to be considered a good sized dessert.  They're around $2.50 each.\\n\\nMike's also has other goodies including yummy marzipan shaped into lifelike fruit, cupcakes, gelato, cakes, etc.\\n\\nGo here for THE epitome of a good cannoli.

As for the food, my friend was the lucky one by not eating because it was disgusting. Vile, greasy and overcooked! Anyway, back to my friend...Jenny was actually screaming at her like a lunatic. I quote \\"We pay thousand dollah to band to play here, you have to buy food or drink!!!\\" My friend has asthma and had her water with her, and that's all she wanted and was likely to order a drink later in the evening, but apparently even soda is not enough for Jenny. Although they have a sign out front that says \\"no cover charge\\" Jenny feels otherwise, even to the point of harassing elderly patrons. The Elvis show was pretty bad actually, so no need to ever go here again.

We waited five mins and hen got up ourselves to get a menu, the server dared to tell us while pointing at a tiny sign \\"at any restaurant you wait to be seated\\" very rudely. Yes I understand that because I work at a death where we have a big sign that says please wait to be seated, but when we are busy and customers seat them selves we go to their table and WE apologize for not being able to approach them ourselves and WE give hem menus, never have them get them themselves. NEVER would we ever tell them a rude comment like \\" at any restaurant you wait to be seated\\" we left immediately. Will not be giving this place a dime of my money with the way they talk to me and my family for their poor customer service. I pray this place goes it if business and they lose their jobs.

Inside, we were whisked to a table as soon as we came in and the carts came rolling by.\\n\\nI noticed right away that there was no choice of silverware for the \\"chopstick impaired\\", and the chopsticks were of a slippery plastic variety that were difficult for a newbie to operate. My husband, who has been to China a couple times, had no problems. Also, for beverages offered at the table there seemed to be hot tea or ice water, and we had to ask for the ice water.\\n\\nThe food was mostly delicious and the things I didn't care for my husband liked. I liked the mushroom and the pork dumplings best. I liked the sesame and red bean paste balls least and normally they are a favorite with me. These had an overload of the red bean paste and it was just too much for me.\\n\\nThe ladies pushing the carts and the hostess were very nice. Since there was a bit of a language barriar we just smiled and pointed at what we wanted on the carts and they seemed happy to serve us. We did not get attentive, fawning service there like at some American restaurants but I didn't mind at all.\\n\\nOh, and the women's bathroom was not filthy.

I have been going to the Tuscan Grill for years and the newer chef has made some great improvements to an already spectacular and truly authentic Tuscan restaurant.\\n\\nHowever, I only wish to address the errors for the sake of those who may read your review.\\n\\n1) The bread is supposed to be oily.  It's a key feature of focaccia bread. Please refer to http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/search?query=focaccia&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=submit. Please take note that focaccia \\"begins by being shaped into a large, flat round that is liberally brushed or drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt.\\" If you weren't expecting focaccia to be \\"liberally brushed\\" with olive oil, I can understand why you would be shocked.\\n\\n2) If you sit at the food bar, you will notice that there is no heat lamp and that the dishes are delivered immediately from the open kitchen to the tables.  There isn't even a heat lamp for food to sit under. For this reason, you can understand the inaccuracy in stating that the puree \\"clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp as they dried out and had a slight crust on them.\\" Literally impossible.\\n\\n3) A little about gelato.  Although a quick google search would provide and easy simple answer, yes, you are mistaken. Greatly. Both about what gelato is, as well as when the gelato is scooped. First, gelato is both milk and cream based.  I am not sure how you came to believe it is only milk based, but gelato simply has a greater proportion of whole milk to cream, so it contains about 6 percent fat, as opposed to ice cream's legal requirement to contain at least 10% fat. Again, with the open kitchen set up, you would have noticed that the gelato is scooped to order, evident by the garde manger cook pulling out the gelato every time an order comes through.\\n\\nI understand that paying attention to the open kitchen was not your first priority in dining out that evening, but I just wanted to correct some of your grossly inaccurate and potentially damaging statements for the Yelp community."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Ok seriously, this place blew my mind.

To the point to where I feel compelled to vent.\\n\\nSee Beau, the food & drinks were never very good.  But it wasn't just the view that made me excuse it, it was this whole feel of community that the restaurant had with the open main deck, the outdoor stage, the multilevel mini-decks.  But you apparently never understood why you were so successful.  Otherwise, you would never close the main deck to put in...let me get this straight...shops.  Retail.  And you build these admittedly beautiful but souless inside (yes, not outside but inside) decks that are open to the outdoors and think we're going to all get the same vibe?   Now...it just feels like a Disney-esque representation of what it was.\\n\\nInstead of letting the setting and the landscape speak for itself, everything is stone and  fake hit-you-over-the-head Tuscan.

Then for dessert, which is like the main draw to this place even though the food was great too! This place has so many cool shakes and sundaes! Most of the shakes will have entire slices of cake or cookies or something on top of the shake! They look so cool and are just as yummy! We had the cookie jar shake and this cream puff and eclair sundae. Both huge and so good! I also think it's so cool that they have this whole fictional backstory for the restaurant with these two characters, Penelope and Jacques. Both of those characters are walking around the restaurant interacting with customers and they were so nice. That was really cool. Service in general was fantastic. Only downside to this place is that yeah it's kinda on the more expensive side, especially the desserts,  but they're so big, almost excessively big,  that the price isn't too bad.

I had the fish of the day, which was catfish crusted in pecans. It was sweet and savory and fresh. I was really amazed at just how good it was. For dessert we shared the peanut butter pie, which knocked my socks off. Seriously, I wanted to take a whole one home.

I am SO glad the restaurant was not one of those \\"try too hard to be Asian\\" places. Blue dragon to me, is New American cuisine with heavy Asian influence. \\n\\n4 stars for the whole dining experience including service, atmosphere and fun-level of the menu...but food-wise, I'd probably give it a 3 star for taste and flavor. \\n\\nOH, I should probably also mention that it seemed like everyone who worked there was blessed with the \\"good looks\\" gene. Just sayin'.\\n\\nThe wait was about 25 minutes for 2 people on a Monday night at 8pm (they don't take reservations), but we waited by the bar and time flew by. The drinks list was full of whimsical cocktails priced between $11-$14. Not cheap, but not crazy. \\n\\nWe were seated at the \\"chef's table\\", which is literally right across from the open kitchen, so we got to see the 5-6 chefs work their magic in the kitchen.\\n\\nOur dishes:\\nWhipped Edamame Hummus with Spiced Pita Chips - $4 - Probably wouldn't order this again since it really wasn't special. We could barely taste the edamame. If you covered your eyes, you'd think you were eating regular garlic hummus. Nothing you can't buy from Trader Joes or make yourself at home. \\n\\nPanko Fish 'n Chips - Local Cod, House Fries and Chinese Black Vinegar Aioli - $11 - Delicious fresh fish fried to crispy perfection. The panko gave the tender fish plenty of crunch and whatever sweet and sour concoction the chefs used to drizzle on the panko fish? SPOT ON. Chips were alright. They're thick cut, double fried so they're ULTRA crunchy yet doesn't leave your mouth feeling greasy. \\n\\nBeer-Steamed Mussels with Taro Fries - $12 - I like the idea of the beer instead of wine, but it left the broth a little bland. Some salt would have helped but I loved the taro fries that came with the dish! Much crunchier and substantial than a regular potato fry, Ming didn't try to do too much with the taro itself and left it as is. Just fried, with salt. \\n\\nSoft shell crab po'boy - $12 - A meun special. Probably my favorite dish of the night. This rather small sandwich (6 bites and you're done) had a lightly breaded and fried soft shell crab, topped with this delicious fresh sweet 'n tangy slaw, all sandwiched between some fresh crusty bread (that was a little too chewy for my taste). \\n\\nPad Thai with Scallops and Bacon - $12 - Pretty good flavors, a little sweet, a little tart, but heavy on the \\"wok\\"/smokiness. The 6 scallops were a tad chewy (over cooked), but the bacon bits (thicker cut than regular American bacon) were deliciously porky and flavorful. \\n\\nLooking back, I noticed THEME OF THE NIGHT = FRIED. FATTY. FOODS. \\n\\nFelt a little sick after our meal. We were STUFFED to the brim. For about $30/person including tax and tip for all this can't-find-anywhere-else food, good atmosphere and excellent service, I was a pretty happy camper. :)"},{"name":"Austin's Pizza South Lamar","address":"1817 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I have 2 words to describe the best part about this place......Online Ordering!!!\\n\\nAustin's pizza is my go to pizza place.

Torched Hop has nearly everything you could possibly need in a brewer for a fun outing with new or old friends. Their location is positioned on Ponce Ponce De Leon in Midtown Atlanta east of 75/85. First and foremost is their quality beer. I sampled a few IPA's with the cloudier and hoppier ones being my favorite. Everyone is attempting the NE IPAs, and for good reason, but Torched Hop is succeeding better than most in the area. Where Torched Hop stands out is the effort placed into entertaining their guest. This is done though many games they have spread out among the space. This was the first brewery I've been to that has shuffleboard, bocce ball and a Nintendo 64 available to guest. I'm guessing the owners are children of the 90s because my childhood was easily represented through other board games and movies they had playing above the bar. For food I decided to try out their kimchi rice. This dish has a dark short grain rice, kimchi and a fried egg. These flavors were perfectly satisfying and much better than most brewery food I've had in the past. There were of course the typical bar food options but I appreciated an offering that showcased some creativity.

My predilection for brewery stops on vacation is now well ingrained in both family and friends so as to make this an easy stop on the tourist itinerary.\\n\\nSetting was very much like a Rock Bottom Brewery in the states so take that for what you will.\\n\\nThere is a small brewing facility behind glass at the back of the building separating the bar from, yes, a liquor store? What's up with that I'm not sure but there is no physical thruway just a visual connection. \\n\\nThe brewery is not an amazing setup but pretty cool display of the process. Couldn't get the specifics out of the bartender but looked like a 5 or 10 barrel system and no bottling or canning just on premise draught/kegs/growlers.\\n\\nBeer selection would be considered Classic in my book nothing outrageous and every beer well within the normal tasting range of the style. \\n\\nI skipped the traditional Canadian flavorless piss beers and went straight for the IPA and seasonal ESB which were both well balanced hop forward beers that would standup favorably with most contemporary American Craft Brewereries. I finished with a nice Nut Brown Ale that was round and filling but I would guess weighed in more like a session beer. \\n\\nI was dissapointed that the list didn't include ABV nor did the bartender seem to think that any of them varied much from the diplomatic 5.0% Based on the three beers I tried I would disagree, but can't be sure without a heads-up from the brewer or someone familiar with the beers.\\n\\nThere is a cask tapped every Thursday-ish that sounded interesting but that was not in the cards this trip.

There was a line a few times we were there (try getting there earlier in the day, especially if you're able to go during a weekday, if you want some more time to browse the display case and place your order), but the multiple clerks behind the counter kept things moving. \\n\\nThe prices were *extremely* reasonable ... two large cannolis and a cupcake were about six dollars ... and most of the clerks were very quick in getting the items and packaging them. I'm not normally a fan of cannolis because I don't care for the filling, but Mike's cannolis were very creamy and delicious, and the cannoli shell was light and flaky instead of heavy and greasy-tasting. We also had a brownie, a chocolate cupcake with white frosting, a slice of Oreo cheesecake and a sfogliatelle/lobster tail, all of which were delicious. \\n\\nMy only complaint was that one clerk was a little slow in getting my order, at a time when nobody else was in the store. I also asked for a cup of tea to go, and she didn't put any milk in it (sugar is available in packets on the far side of the counter), so I asked another clerk to give me a splash of milk and the second clerk seemed visibly annoyed at the first because the first didn't take care of this for me. But to be fair, the clerk that served me seemed to be new, and I didn't originally ask for anything in my tea (although she also didn't ask how I took it). Not a big deal, nothing worth getting upset over. Also, if you want table service, be prepared to wait (both for a table and a waitress ... we had other people served before us and had to wait over 5 minutes for a waitress to come over, but there was one waitress serving about 7 full tables on a busy day). \\n\\nMike's is absolutely worth a visit if you're in Boston.

Even though when our server came by shortly after that with the check and told us to take our time, I just really hate that.  I get it when a place is busy and they're trying to encourage you to go, but a) I'm not rushing after dropping $15 on a bagel, and b) it was the end of the brunch service and there were a few open tables and no one waiting.  \\n\\nOtherwise, A+ dining as usual.\\n\\nUpdate to update: I got a complimentary slice cake the size of my head on my birthday.

Although they've got a fairly large restaurant space, it gets so packed during brunch on the weekends that you'll probably wait at least 20 minutes for a table. Because of how busy they are, I expected the service to be a bit slow, but our server Noah was awesome; he was always around to refill our cups and answer any questions we had about the menu, and he brought out food orders out much faster than we (a party of 9) expected. My friend and I shared the Roughrider Omelette and the Banana Stuffed French Toast. The omelette was served alongside an \\"English muffin\\", which was so big that I almost mistook is for an extra plate! The omelette itself was pretty good, but it didn't have as much Vermont cheddar and corned beef hash as I expected. In fact, I only got my first bite of cheese as I was finishing my half of the omelette up. But regardless, it was still good. The Stuffed Banana French Toast however... Now that was a work of art. Most brunch restaurants that I've been to will \\"stuff\\" their French toast by slathering some sort of a sauce between two pieces of bread. However, Zaftigs takes their Banana Stuffed French Toast much more seriously than other places. It arrived at our table as what appeared to be a very large brick of challah bread with assorted berries sprinkled on top. But once we cut into it, all this deliciously soft banana pur√©e oozed out of it! It was so delicious that I devoured it within minutes.  Although I only tried two items off of a multi-page menu, I think that the Banana Stuffed French Toast is a safe bet for anyone who can't decide what to order for brunch. I felt kind of guilty for not trying one of Zaftigs' more authentic Jewish/ Eastern options, so I will definitely need to come back for lunch or dinner and give those a try!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"4 words: Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. \\n\\nSunday brunch line beating tip:  Put your name in and then head to Powells for an hour."},{"name":"Dos Hermanos Taco Truck","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I got to check out this food truck when it was outside of 7th Son Brewery.

There's no beer on tap. As in none. Bottles? Well, there's Sam and Sam Light...and then a bunch of your usual American Light water/beer. Seriously though, nothing on tap.\\n\\nI was hoping the food would make up for it.\\n\\nIt didn't.\\n\\nMy \\"red, white and blue\\" onion soup was just meh. Also, it came out almost immediately after ordering, so I know it wasn't fresh baked. The menu boasted of caramelizing both white and red onions in Sam Adams beer. First, as they have no beer on tap, did they crack bottles for cooking?? Also, my thin slice of baguette had a layer of blue cheese coating it. Fine. However, the slice of bread was significantly smaller than the bowl of soup. As such, the bread and cheese were submerged in an attempted to eat it. This resulted in both disintegrating in the broth. Generally, the soup tasted okay, but was much less exciting than the menu led me to believe.\\n\\nFor my entre I got the \\"catch of the day\\". I put it in quotes as this catch was Tilapia. To my knowledge, Tilapia is native to Africa and parts of Asia...not New England...thus making me question it's \\"catch of the day\\" status. The dish was supposed to be served wrapped in bacon, topped with some kind of tomato salsa/sauce/chutney/thing with a side of cilantro rice and asparagus. That sauce stuff was disgusting and uninspired. There are more spices in the world than salt and chili paste. I don't eat bacon, so got my fish without. I can only imagine how salty the dish would have been if I hadn't requested it without bacon. The rice was just meh. Again, way too much salt. The asparagus was of the way too slender variety and many of the ends were tough. The only thing I finished on my plate was the asparagus....and that's because I really love asparagus.\\n\\nThe waitress was nice, but really just okay. When she recited the specials it seemed rehearsed and like she was straining to remember what they were. We were never asked if we wanted a dessert menu, simply just given them...one menu even being placed in my brother's hand.\\n\\nMany hotels have stepped up their restaurants so as to compete with the plethora of options available in the city.

When I came back from Italy, I couldn't stand any American made bread, until I found Lee's-- they make true bread, with the fluffy interior and crispy exterior, fresh baked every day, and if it's a day old, it's super cheap (I think 6 baguettes for a dollar! Great for garlic bread or french toast).  Especially important is that when I was unemployed I could still afford their Banh Mi, which is the most wonderful sandwich I've ever had, and I have probably eaten over 100 since I discovered them (maybe more). I've been a loyal customer for years and will continue to be as long as they are around.

The hotel looks NOTHING like the pictures. It is old, outdated and has an odor to it. \\n2. The reservations agent made me hold for about 7 min and when he finally returned was completely rude. When asked about the occupancy for the evening he said \\"we are almost sold out.\\" I was literally the only person on my floor. \\n3. The bathroom was in really poor shape, not dirty but very outdated. \\n4. It seems like they ran out of fitted sheets. The first night I had a flat sheet that was used as a fitted that did not even cover the entire mattress. I felt the mattress pad on my feet the entire night. My brother didn't get so lucky... his bed did not even have a mattress pad.\\n5. The pillows feel like rocks and feathers were constantly coming out of them. \\n6. The indoor pool was closed as were both the women's and men's locker rooms. \\n7. The outdoor pool was average at best, the water looked dirty. \\n\\nTo sum it up, I guess I had higher expectations.

The shell should NOT be so soft that it's impossible to peel it off the meat. And the meat should NOT be so shriveled that it's not worth the good fight of peeling a crawfish. And at $5.99 a pound, the little honeys should jump off the plate and into your mouth all on their own.  And my last comment about the crawfish... for heaven sakes people... the seasoning goes in the damn water, not sprinkled on top when the crawfish comes out. OMG! \\n\\nThe oysters were like none I had ever seen before... HUGE! The resembled something I have seen at a sushi restaurant... the really huge oysters that are marinated and served one per customer. These oysters were not the little Gulf gems I am use to eating.
