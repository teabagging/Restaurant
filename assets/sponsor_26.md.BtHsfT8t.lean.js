Perhaps not the fanciest in terms of atmosphere but by far the best food I've eaten in Colorado over the last 40 years and I've eaten about everywhere worth eating.  Both the food and wine reflect the owners' finely honed, intelligent and passionate dedication to their craft.  I would expect nothing less considering that their alma mater is Thomas Keller's now legendary the French Laundry.\\n\\nQuickly, the room and patio are fine, perhaps a little tighter than I'd prefer but you can't judge a book by its cover.  The food and wine are the show stoppers here.  You can dress relatively casually and be comfortable - this is Boulder after all.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of ingredients and expert handling of them.\\n\\nThe full menu, which changes seasonally and celebrates the cuisine of Friuli in Northern Italy, is available Tues - Sat.  Monday nights feature a prix fixe set menu and wine pairing.  You will likely need a reservation although they reserve a few seats for walk-ins.\\n\\nFood recommendations:  Sublime Salumi!!  These little piggies did not die for naught ($16 for an ample sample of porcine goodness.)  And, then you must have the Frico Caldo (a toasty, cheesy, Friuli miracle at only $7).

Mussels, chard, and summer squash.  2nd - it's a toss up - either the Braised Lamb or the life changing Gnocchi with Blue Prawns.  Never liked gnocchi - Lachlan  has made a believer of me.  3rd - Wild Striped Bass with shell beans, tomato and mustard greens or, if you're a carnivore, Grilled Angus Beef Rib with farro, kale, braised leeks and garlic.  Finally, this is summer in Colorado - HELLO Palisade Peach Turnover with house-made puff pastry and cinnamon \\"crema\\".  I suppose you could wrap up with house-made chocolates or a lovely cheese sampler but you certainly don't need either.\\n\\nA word about the wine list.  It is truly a tutorial.  Organized by flavor profile, the list is heavily European but there are carefully chosen entries from across the globe.  Bobby has done an amazing job of selecting wines that all pair well with Lachlan's food.  Put yourself in his hands if you are unsure.  Trust me, he will not steer you wrong or to the most expensive selections unless you tell him to go crazy, and  you should, because food like this deserves a truly great wine - or two.\\n\\nIf you truly love great food and wine and you haven't been to Frasca, you simply must go - soon.

They gave us a huge plate of pastries so we definitely got a lot of food, but I still question the cost of breakfast being $72! Wowza! So, as I said earlier, beautiful decor, decent/okay food. I still loved my experience since you could walk around the castle after eating and even see the 'West Wing' but I do wish the food was a little better with classier service!"},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Bakersfield...

Their chips and guac are great!  The tacos are satisfying and the flavors are right.  When I first went here, which I believe was when they first opened, the margaritas were great.  I'm not sure what happened, but I will not drink them anymore.  They taste of too much \\"mix\\" and leave me way too thirsty.  Close friends that know the bartenders claim they make their own mix...  So I'm not sure where the fault lies here.\\n\\nOh, and the TV's...  What is up with TV's in every restaurant.  I understand this is a big college sports town, but if you're not going to have actual sports on, I don't get it.  It's just distracting.\\n\\nAgain...  I want to give this place more stars but it gets way too crowded, the margaritas aren't great, and the overall experience is not really worth the price.

Really, not the same thing as happy hour sushi. This will make this place suffer, as the main reason why we went there was for the happy hour sushi. I had their chirashi last night and it was only so-so. The chirashi from Mr. Sushi in Arlington is much better. I think the cheap happy hour sushi was clouding my judgement because last night the sushi didn't taste all that fresh and even looked a little rundown. However, they have recently undergone yet another renovation, so the interior is quite nice and well-lit.**\\n\\n\\nI absolutely love Sushi 21. It's one of our favourite places to go for comfort food like nabeyaki udon or tonkatsu. Their happy hour sushi special is quite a deal at about $1 / nigiri sushi and consistently tasty.

Do yourself a favor, and come towards the end of happy hour to take advantage of their food and drink specials and then move onto the main course.\\n\\nFood (7/10)\\n\\n(9/10) Gulf Prawns & Cilantro-Tomato Charmoula\\nCharmoula is a Moroccan marinade made of herbs, oil and spices. This appetizer is simply outstanding. The shrimp is juicy and flavorful. The charmoula was comparable in taste to pesto sauce. We could eat a couple bowls of this one and is on the happy hour menu too!\\n\\n(6/10) Blistered Padron Peppers & Smoked Sea Salt\\nPadron is an area of Spain where these peppers are fried and served with olive oil and coarse salt. Fino stayed true to its roots and served them in a similar fashion. Some of them tasted tame, while others were a little spicier. We found the salty taste overpowering and took some of the salt off.  They were also too oily.\\n\\n(7/10) Braised Lamb Shank with Romesco\\nWith fideos parmesano (angel hair pasta), scallions & garlic aioli. We ordered this one with apprehension, due to our disappointing experience with the lamb chops at Aquarelle. Well, this may sound clich√© but the lamb fell right off the bone. It was very soft and tender, and we were impressed by the amount too. The Romesco sauce is mild and slightly nutty, but pleasant. The pasta complemented the meat well and was cooked nicely. Fino's chefs made this lamb shank a very enjoyable entr√©e, and we'd order it again.\\n\\n(8/10) Pan Roasted Sea Bass\\nWith Serrano ham, green beans, brown butter and Marcona almonds. The sea bass is crisp and flaky on the outside and succulent on the inside. The brown butter really comes through, and the almonds on top added a nice crunch. There wasn't enough Serrano ham, but when we had a bite of it with the fish - it was yummy! Also noteworthy - the bass sat on a big bed of beans. This isn't the kind of place that will put just three green beans on the side of the plate as decoration. Every element of this entr√©e was carefully thought out because they all harmonized together.\\n\\n(8/10) Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Cake\\nWith vanilla cream and cocoa-espresso sauce. This little cake is lovely. Normally we don't like espresso flavored desserts, but this one is an exception because there is only a hint of espresso in the sauce. The cake is soft, warm and almost melts in your mouth. The cream didn't do much for us as we would have preferred some ice cream.\\n\\nService (9/10)\\n\\nThe service here is on point. We made reservations and the sweet hostess seated us immediately. Because it was our first time there, they gave us a sherry to drink while we ordered appetizers. They also brought out one of those tiny complimentary snacks - which is another sign you are at a classy restaurant! Our waitress was friendly, chatty, and knowledgeable of the menu. We never felt rushed and she answered questions thoroughly. During our meal, she was attentive without being overbearing. I called beforehand and asked if they could put a candle in the dessert  but they either forgot or it was lost in passing down this message. When I found our waitress and asked if they had a candle - she said they would bring it out in a scoop of ice-cream for the birthday boy! They also said the dessert would be complimentary. How gracious... this restaurant is definitely tops for service.\\n\\nAmbiance (8/10)\\n\\nFino is tucked away in a small shopping center, and complimentary parking is available in the adjacent garage. It has a large, covered outdoor patio/lounge and two dining rooms inside. One room is slightly quieter, more formal, and may be more suitable for couples. The other side is a little noisier and could be better for groups. The interior has table and booth seating available, but keep in mind the tables are rather close together. There is a large window that lets a lot of natural light in, and low-lighting for when it becomes darker outside. This restaurant has a trendy vibe but still remains somewhat contemporary/casual. It is unexpectedly charming and appears to be one of Austin's hidden gems.

What was that craving, the beef cumin flatbread, this time with my partner in tow, and needing to kill an hour around this neighbourhood I had the chance again to have this menu item located on the back under the dim sum section.\\n\\nHow do you describe it, something so satisfying that your mouth waters once you see it approaching the table. The steam eminating from the middle of the wrap, the small strands of cut beef, mixed with thin strips of green peppers, some hints of some hot spicy peppers to add the kick, mixed in with the cumin spice. The sesame filled flatbread that would crumble on the bite you take in, and the plate below collecting all your flakes and falling strands of beef while you maintain yourself from the true delight of eating this piece of comfort food.

It certainly has no threat of ever being dubbed as floppy or soggy either. It provides a nice crunch and flavor that couples the plentiful toppings just the way you want it to. \\n\\nI'd say the one thing that sets Louie's many steps above its competitors is the overall flavor. The spices are neither nonexistent nor overpowering. This family-owned pizza shop knows what's up. If you like bland pizza that simply \\"fills the hole,\\" then don't spoil yourself with Louie's, since it's a bit on the pricey side.\\n\\nMake sure you place your orders nice and early.

We checked it out, and it was smoke-free, so we went for it since we could get a table upstairs right away.\\n\\nThis was a big mistake.  Our waiter was pleasant and attentive, but overall the team service was erratic.  We had no silverware initially, save the fork I had the presence of mind to snatch from the buffet.  My friend ordered from the menu, and she was left waiting with her food getting cold while the waitstaff tried to find silverware.  I was glad I buffeted it, and the buffet was as good as ever.\\n\\nIt was a peaceful environment until precisely 1:50 PM, when someone turned on the music instantly LOUD.  This happened right in the middle of a cell phone call for a medically urgent situation concerning a family member, which really pissed me off.  At 1:55, the first chain smokers entered the bar.  As soon as the door closed at 1:58, the smokestack fired to life.

The tostada was eggs and chorizo topped with pico de gallo and sour cream and salsa on the side on a fried corn tortilla.  My only complaint is that's difficult to eat.  You can try to cut it but since the tortilla is fried, it just breaks apart.  So you can hold it and bite it but then the eggs or the chorizo just fall off.

Let me step back for a moment and say that this is not my favorite bar; it is not a quiet dive that you will return to on a quiet wednesday night to get a few stiff drinks to get you through the week (their drinks aren't terribly stiff anyways). But it is a PLACE, and a place where the more is merrier. \\n\\nLet's start out with their interior. It's ridiculously spacious, with an amazing dark wood panel interior and wall art that meticulously fits both the open room and the intrinsic curiosity to explore every inch when you go in there. How much did they pay for their decorating? Who cares? There's a beautifully stocked bar in front of you.\\n\\nGo to the bar. You are amongst a hopping crowd, and pretty much everyone is taller (and perhaps more beautiful) than you. It would normally take an hour just for one drink order in a place like this, but pop yourself up to the front (no one will glare at you sideways) and the bartender is on it. Only 4 bucks for a well drink? Don't mind if I do.\\n\\nGo outside - you can't find a seat indoors anyways - and the patio puts shame to the already decadent interior. Fireplaces, ping pong, a giant projector, bamboo, and enough seating for an entire castle from the middle ages are now available. It's still loud, and everyone around you is eating fondue (which I need to try - all of their food looks exceptional).

You serve yourself pastries using your own wax-lined bamboo tray and set of tongs and order cakes and drinks at the counter.\\n\\nSo many things looked amazing, like the packaged peanut crunch bread and the blueberry chiffon cake.  I like how they have a good balance of savory and sweet pastries--the sweet potato garlic pastry seemed interesting.  I also appreciate that they have ingredients and calorie data on everything since it's easy to go crazy at a place like this.\\n\\nAfter much deliberation, I went for a new item, the creme br√ªl√©e \\"bon bon\\" (although it was more of a fried pastry).  I don't really understand how they engineered this: it's a ball of yeasted dough filled to the brim with a thin vanilla custard.  It tasted like a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  The bottom was a little soggy, and the top could have been more torched to reinforce the \\"br√ªl√©e\\" aspect of the pastry, but overall a high quality, indulgent treat, especially at $1.75.\\n\\nI should have heeded the reviews and skipped the bubble tea, but I just can't say no to boba. I paid $0.95 to add boba to an iced green tea ($2.50 for a small).  Sadly, the tapioca was overcooked--slimy without any chew--and seemed like it was soaked in white sugar instead of more flavorful honey syrup.  Disappointing, but maybe it was a one-time thing?\\n\\nParis Baguette would be a great place to do work or catch up with a friend because it's quiet and clean inside.

Ordered the French Onion Soup, the Croque Monsieur, and The Master's Cupcake.\\n\\nQuality\\nI remember when I visited Magic Kingdom as a child, the plan was always to bring snacks, so we did not have to overpay for the food in the park. But times have changed, and there has been a clear push to improve the food across theme parks and make dining part of the overall experience. Unfortunately, Magic Kingdom seems to have missed that memo. Of the different Disney parks, it definitely has the lowest quality options. Still, I decided to give Be Our Guest Restaurant a shot, because if nothing else it was supposed to be an experience. And I absolutely agree that Disney has done a stunning job at recreating the castle from Beauty & The Beast, but the food was just terrible. I started with the French Onion Soup, which was the only item I would consider ordering again. It is hard to mess up such a simple dish, but it still could have used some bread on the side. For my entree I went with the Croque Monsieur, which was bad. It was the standard grilled sandwich of ham and cheese, with a side of fries, but it looked like it was just thrown together. The sandwich was falling apart, the bread was stale, and the fries were cold. I'm sure part of this was due to the service method, but they have got to do better. I finished my meal with The Master's Cupcake, because I'm a sucker and had to try the grey stuff. It was anything but delicious as the frosting was bland and flavorless.\\n\\nQuantity\\nThey serve up a pretty large bowl of French Onion Soup. It was a good thing too, because the Croque Monsieur was laughably small.\\n\\nValue\\nWay too expensive for what was served. Even taking into account the amazing job they did in placing guests inside the movie, the restaurant has some of the worst value in all of Disney. The Croque Monsieur for $14 is ridiculous and even the decent sized French Onion Soup is too much at $7.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nBe Our Guest Restaurant is found in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. This restaurant is designed after Beast's castle from Beauty & The Beast and it is a sight to behold. As you approach from the outside you see a small castle up on a hill. It is surrounded by a moat like structure and you must traverse a bridge to enter. After making your way into the massive doors that hold portraits of the movie's myth, you enter into a whole different world. Every detail and every element has been crafted to truly dazzle any Disney fan. The dining areas are the most impressive. At the center is a massive ballroom, with high ceilings and massive chandeliers. On the left side you will find the a darkened room modeled off the room the Beast kept the rose in. With lightning and thunder flashing in the background and the rose itself sparking and losing pedals, it was incredible. The last room was the simplest, a cozy den with a rotating statute of the main characters dancing and portraits from the movie across the walls. And I am sure the restaurant had even more hidden elements that bigger fans of the movie would go crazy for. I don't know if you are permitted to visit without ordering food, but if you can that would be the best option.\\n\\nCrowd\\nThe restaurant is massive, but still it was a fight to grab a seat. For the ambiance alone, Be Our Guest Restaurant is one of the most popular restaurants at Disney. Large families piled into the restaurant and the self-seating nature led to a mad dash as people tried to scrounge up enough chairs to seat their party. However, most folks upon initial entrance don't know or see the two side rooms, so they are much easier to find a table in when the restaurant fills up.\\n\\nService\\nThe staff was all extremely friendly in the usual Disney way, but the ordering process is very strange. First you speak with the booth near the entrance where they determine if you have a reservation or not. This places you in one of two lines, shorter if you had committed ahead of time. They provide a menu as you wait in line and eventually take your order at the front. You are then handed a glowing plastic rose, which contains a GPS tracker. They tell you to select a seat and place the tracker on the table. Eventually a cart will pull up to your table and deliver your food, but you are responsible for your drinks and utensils. It felt like an unnecessary procedure and one likely prone to mistake.\\n\\nParking\\nBe Our Guest Restaurant is located inside of Magic Kingdom, so it requires a ticket to the park. The park has its own massive parking lot, but you can also utilize different forms of Disney transportation, such as monorail, bus, or boat to get there.\\n\\nExtra\\nBe Our Guest Restaurant is a sight to behold and will fascinate any child or adult who loves Beauty & The Beast. However, the food is bad and the prices are high, even for Disney. I don't know if things are different during dinner, but I would not recommend it for lunch."},{"name":"Frank's Noodle House - Beaverton","address":"15950 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Best thick chewy noodles in town.

That is multitasking personified!! But I presume that working in such an environment requires one to be so.\\nThe food as always is amazing! Being a creature of habit, I usually get the milanese, which is perfectly breaded and seasoned, and the mussels, which is divine. The best thing about the mussels is that they are de-shelled, making them easy to enjoy. Also, the Salmon and the Bolognese are delicious!!\\nA few weeks ago, we also got to chat with the head chef who seems down-to-earth and was very responsive to the feedback we had to offer; this was especially nice as most executive chefs tend to stay away from interacting with their clientele, leaving it only to the managing staff to deal with.

Initially Queen of Sheba got my hopes up, as the menu lists some unusual options for vegans: a dish with mushrooms, and another dish with flax seeds. I've been to a few dozen different Ethiopian places and have never seen mushrooms or flax seeds anywhere else.\\n\\nAs such, I thought this place would be special. It was not.\\n\\nDespite my misgivings, we ordered a veggie combo platter to share amongst four people ($23). I hate the veggie combo platter. It's a bad deal that every Ethiopian joint runs to charge you more money for less food. What's that, you say? You want to try every dish and the combo platter is the only way? Forget trying every dish. At the end of the day, it'll all be variations on lentils, split peas or potatoes, either in mild sauce or spicy berbere sauce. Some of the dishes won't even have sauce: they'll just be stewed collard greens and carrots. You're not missing out on anything.\\n\\nMy suggestion: NEVER order the combo platter. Order one mild dish (the split peas) and order one spicy dish (the lentils in berbere sauce or the potatoes in berbere sauce). You'll get much more food for less money. And you won't have to put up with the boring dishes that nobody wants to eat after they realize the ones with sauce are much tastier.\\n\\nAnyway, rant over. The food was really disappointing. I'm not sure what was wrong. None of the dishes felt fresh, and they were all lukewarm in temperature. Most of the veggie combo platter consisted of bland dishes and, as you could imagine, the spicy, relatively flavorful ones got lapped up right away.\\n\\nThe injera was heavy and overly sour. This was low-grade injera, to be sure.\\n\\nThe mushroom dish and flax seed dish that caught my attention online turned out to be complete duds.\\n\\nAlso, I'm not sure that Queen of Sheba understands the term \\"vegan\\" (though it uses the word on its menu freely), as I'm pretty certain one of the dishes was made with yogurt or buttermilk (ingredients not commonly used in Ethiopian food, but some regions of Ethiopia do incorporate some dairy into their dishes). It was a weird brown gloopy thing that everyone hated (and two of my group are not even vegetarian).\\n\\nAlso, the service was mixed at best. Our waitress was pretty surly (though also amusing at times) and not very attentive or fast. \\n\\nFor instance, we wanted an extra plate so that each half of the table could have easy access to the injera. Otherwise, one half of the table had to keep asking the other half to pass the injera. Our waitress initially rejected our request for an extra plate (note, we were just asking for a plate, not for more injera), claiming that's not Ethiopian custom. It's Ethiopian custom to make it difficult for people to eat, by forcing them to reach across tables for bread? Only after some persistence did she relent and give us the plate.\\n\\nAll told, Queen of Sheba was a massive disappointment."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"299 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Extremely Disturbing!\\n\\nI am a Principal Assistant in one of the BPS schools in the district and we had a meeting with the princpal and staff.

Food and drinks seemed a little too pricey for what they were, but were fine overall. My review has more to do with the service and management, which was not great.\\n\\nAt one point in the night, we noticed a man sitting alone, drinking and staring at us... One friend had to use the restroom, so she went down the stairs to where the bathrooms were. My other friend leaned over and said that the guy who was staring at us followed her downstairs and that maybe we should go check it out. So I went downstairs too, and opened the clearly marked women's bathroom door. Inside was the man, standing outside the stall my friend was using, in an otherwise totally empty bathroom with other open stalls.... So I said, excuse me.... And he got spooked and ran out upstairs. My friend came out and was totally shaken up. We told the restaurant management what happened, but in the meantime the guy went back downstairs. \\n\\nThe manager eventually asked him to leave (after a man sitting next to us spoke up to vouch for our story), and he disappeared into the night. We asked the management to call police, out of concern that this guy was just going to go somewhere else and do the same thing. \\n\\nIt turns out that the restaurant management we spoke to straight up lied to us about calling the police. The manager gave a whole story about how he reported the incident to the police, but he didn't know if they were going to show up, and anyways the guy already left. But my friend followed up with the non-emergency line later on that night, and the police said they haven't received any phone calls from or about that restaurant since November. \\n\\nNot cool.

My husband and I have been going to Papagayo at Assembly regularly since it first opened. The food is reliably good and the servers are nice and attentive. \\n\\nPapagayo is not a fine dining establishment. This is a place where at all times you can see at least seven flat screen tvs, so this should be fairly obvious, but from reading other reviews, it seems like people expect a lot more for a chain restaurant that is one step above Margarita's (but pretty much on par with Border Cafe) than I would. When the most expensive dinner item is $18 and there are plenty of $10 choices, you can't go in expecting the moon. Particularly not when they're busy, and this place gets slammed. (That said, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, expect a wait).\\n\\nIn the many times that we have gone to this Papagayo, we have had one server not bring the free chips/salsa. So, we asked for the chips/salsa. She was apologetic and promptly brought them out. This should also be obvious, but if you're at a restaurant and you didn't get something you want (or ordered), you should ask for it. If you don't ask for it, don't sit around waiting for the server to notice it's missing. \\n\\nThe chips are thicker (as several reviews have mentioned) but they're good and fresh. (Plus, the servers will happily refill your chip bowl, if you want.) The salsa is tasty, but pro tip: ask for the chef's salsa which is significantly spicier. The guacamole is good but it's huge. It's better to get when you have four diners instead of two. \\n\\nI tend to get the chicken tacos, as they're quite good (in the, \\"I occasionally crave these\\" way). My husband loves the fish and the vegetable street tacos. The fajitas are also good, but they have no peppers only onions. (I've ordered them a few times, so that's not a fluke.) The chili dusted fries are extremely tasty (but it's hard for me to justify getting them on top of the chips/salsa). We've also enjoyed the queso dip -- we've never had it be thin but it is a lot like the jarred stuff from the supermarket, which is tasty but not gourmet by any means.\\n\\nAs for the service being slow overall -- we've had mostly prompt service, but it's somewhat relaxed -- the servers want you to take your time, enjoy your meal, etc. Sometimes it's been a bit slow, but you can always call over a waiter or ask someone for help if things are taking a while or if you're in a hurry. We've never had a dining experience take an excrutiatingly long time at Papagayo. \\n\\nOh, I will echo others about the bathroom: so tiny. There are three stalls, but coming out of the third stall, you have to be careful to avoid being hit by the bathroom door (which for some reason swings in instead of out). The other two stalls are directly in front of the sinks, and it's this weird set-up where if you're exiting the stall, you're blocking someone from accessing the sinks AND there's only one hand dryer and it's all the way inside the bathroom, so if there are two people washing their hands, you have to wait for the person nearest the dryer to finish, dry hands, and leave. When there's a line, it's the craziest restroom on Earth. The thing is: it could easily have been done more efficiently, if they had just arranged things differently."},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"201 W 3rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Oh, what can I say but that this restaurant brought all that is good and wonderful about Mexican food to Austin, Texas.

If you've read any of my other reviews you know that i'm a vegetarian. So if you've ever been to Disney World you know that it's filled with all kinds of food, turkey legs, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken fingers, etc. you get the picture. \\nSo when I went to Disney this last time I did some research and found Boma. Boma has received some award in FL for best vegetarian food. So I figured what the heck, i'll give it a try.\\n\\nThe food was delicious!! It's buffet style, so there are all kinds of food to choose from. As for the vegetarian choices, there were different types of potatoes, rice, curries, hummus and flatbreads. There were also several mixed salads, soups, and fresh fruit.  OH! and the desserts! Delicious!!\\nThe best part of the food was that it changed each night. We were in Disney for a week and went back to eat there 3 times. \\n\\nWe had the Disney dining plan so we saved a lot of money. From what I saw of the prices it was a little on the pricey side. If I had to pay out of pocket for the meal we probably wouldn't have gone there so many times. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. We always went an hour or so before it closed because we never made reservations. Usually when you go to restaurants right when they're closing they try to rush you out. But they were very attentive. The server also helped point out all of the vegetarian options before we went up to the buffet. One of them also made it clear that if i didn't find anything that she'd help me talk to the chef so I could have a satisfying meal. \\n\\nMy biggest gripe with Boma is that it's located so far out of the way at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

The server was competent and responsive to questions but felt a little impatient with a large group.  With many large tables, a space equipped for group dining, and a menu which highlights small plates, a servers fluid adjustment to group sharing will be key.

Here is our take on our experience: \\n\\nThe service was slow (It was a friday evening so it was busy) and it took a while for us to get anything we ordered. The food itself was ok. While the menu offers alot of items you don't typically see in most of the Italian restaurants I've ever been to (such as alligator, kangaroo, frog legs, etc), the food just wasn't as good as it sounded.\\n\\nWe ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the fried calamari for appetizers. The mushrooms were ok, the crabmeat in the mushrooms tasted like the artificial crabmeat you buy at the supermarket for very cheap by the pound. The calamari were horrible. They were very over cooked and eating them was like chewing on rubber.\\n\\nFor entrees, my husband ordered the rack of lamb and he wasn't impressed. He said that the mustard really overpowerd the dish and he had that mustard after taste in his mouth the whole night. I got the pan roasted lobster (can't go wrong with lobster right?) and it wasn't what I expected. The sauce was kind of bland, it really didn't do much to the flavor of the lobster itself. But like I said, can't go wrong with lobster, and with sauce or not, the lobster was delicious.\\n\\nDessert was a tragedy. We got the cannolis and they were just bad. Nothing more I can say about them, just that they were really bad.\\n\\nWe did take our own bottle of wine and they didn't charge us to open it, so that was a good thing.\\n\\nAll in all, my husband and I wouldn't eat here again.

What they put in front of you is a melange of all kind of random shit floating in a thick salty soup base.  Someone actually came by to describe each random thing, probably to keep me from chewing on them (which is exactly what I was doing).  I did recognize the szechuan peppers, both by sight and by the spicy numbing deliciousness that infused every spoonful.  Get the spicy broth, people, do yourself a favor.\\n\\nThere's a plethora of stuff to dunk in your flavor bowl: Meat, fish, veggies, mushrooms, more meat.  We got fish balls, which are normally oversalted hunks of nondescript sea product, but these were really flavorful and absorbed the broth nicely.\\n\\nThe $50 check part still came, though.  The place isn't cheap, the broth runs $5 per person and I don't think there's a single dunk-able below $5.  For two people we ate really well for ~$25 per person, and we didn't really go for the higher-end items.  Definitely worth the price, but not an everyday excursion.\\n\\nSo try it out.

We went to an early dinner, arriving at 4 PM. It was moderately busy and as I work in this business I know it was a busy day. Somehow the steak was forgotten off of one combo Neil ordered and one of our other gas ordered a salad which came last to the table, at least 10 minutes after the rest of us were served. We had a total of seven gas so not too terribly large. Our server was not the friendliest and that's understandable considering how busy I'm sure her day was, the management was what was so disappointing. When she was overwhelmed bringing food to tables, he was nowhere to be seen although we had seen him earlier breezing through the dining room not really doing anything. Very very disappointing and will not ever return.

I mean... we're Chinese and have a pretty good sense of what Chinese food should and shouldn't be. That said, most Chinese restaurants we go to disappoint us and I'm pretty skeptical about going to Chinese restaurants in general. I've found that only a few Chinese establishments really amaze us. \\nPeaceful is one of those restaurants that really impressed us. In fact, I think it's the best authentic place outside Asia that comes to mind.\\n\\nThis small establishment had us seated right away and had the usual ice water and hot tea ready for us. We ordered 4 things in total. The XiaoLongBao Steamed Buns (XiaoLongBao), the Sichuan Beef Soup Noodles (HongShaoNiuRouMian), the Steamed Soft Pork Buns (GouBuLiBao), and the Peaceful Beef Rolls (NiuRouJuanBing). Our food came pretty quickly with good portion sizes. \\n\\nXiaoLongBao - Absolutely amazing. Came piping hot with juice bursting out of the shell once bitten. Dough not too thin, not to thick. Filling perfectly sized relative to the shell. Spectacular flavor. Picture perfect buns here.\\n\\nSichuan Beef Noodle Soup - I've had this dish many times at various restaurants. I've found that mediocre restaurants mess this dish up in two ways: either the meat is really dry or the soup (and therefore noodles and entire dish) is too bland or too salty. Peaceful nailed this dish. I thought the meat would be dry, but it absorbed the savory broth to my delight. Broth was perfectly seasoned and tasted wonderful. Greens, sprouts, garlic nicely complementing the meat and noodles. Overall really really good. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good authentic dish. If I had to give any critique, it would be to add an option to make it spicier for spice lovers out there. \\n\\nSteam Soft Pork Buns - We eat this type of bun for breakfast everyday when we are in China. Peaceful's Pork Buns tasted exactly the same as the ones we get in China. It's nothing out of the ordinary for my family since we've had it so many times...but that said, it really impressed us because of it's authenticity. I'm going to refrain from giving it a verdict regarding taste because of the above reasons. But what I will say is that if you do get this dish, know that you are getting a true taste of China. \\n\\nBeef Rolls - Alright. This dish had a lot going for it. The pastry and meat were not  dry (which is usually the biggest problem with this type of dish) and had really great texture. The pastry was really well done and not too greasy (another big aspect of this type of dish). All of that made the dish great. But there was one problem for me....the hoisin sauce was too sweet for me. It overpowered a lot of the other components which made this dish an overall miss for me. I see a lot of other reviews praising this dish and I can see how it could be an amazing dish to some. But not for me. It was too sweet. Biggest miss for me, but if you like hoisin sauce/sweet flavors this dish is for you. \\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to give Peaceful a 4. The 1 star docked because of the beef rolls being too sweet for my taste. But thinking about the restaurant as a whole, the things they did well, they did really well. Those small things they did right truly make Peaceful an exceptional place which let's me overlook the hoisin sauce and confidently give this place 5 stars. It's clean, comfortable interior along with its great service made enjoying the authentic flavors an experience we will repeat in the near future."},{"name":"La Choza","address":"4457 Broadway St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This place is the closest you'll get to true authentic Mexican food in boulder.

The lady then proceeded to explain that the white rice was an additional $3.  When one pays $13 for a broccoli and beef entree, rice is expected to come along with it, no?  And, the way she asked whether he wanted white or brown rice made it sound like it was included.  \\n\\nStill a little confused, we asked what the other $4.50 was for.  Once again, the lady tells us that for every take-out item, they charge $1.50.  $1.50????? For take out???  Who does that!!!  She charged my friend TWO take out fees (1 for broccoli+beef and 1 for the rice!)  Absolutely absurd and poor business practice.  Sure, you might make decent food but scamming customers with poor business ethics is just plain wrong.\\n\\nBy the way, the chicken in my fried rice tasted like it was a day old.

The view absolutely cannot be beat. The restaurant is located on Lake Eola and if you sit outside, you can look out onto the fountain and the swans swimming in the lake. Doesn't get much better than that! \\n\\nThat said, the food is not incredible. It seems like it will be when you're looking at the menu. I found about six things today that caught my eye! We started with some appetizers. I enjoyed the tuna tataki as well as the spicy edamame. Delicious and fresh. The mussels were awesome and the delicious broth they swam in was crying for bread to be dunked into it. Lemon, buttery, garlic goodness. Seriously, get yourself a roll to go with it. \\n\\nThe entree is where it went downhill for me. I ordered the Maytag Blue Salad, a spring greens salad with blue cheese crumbles, bacon, chicken, carrots, and a sweet paprika dressing. I am truly thankful that I decided to taste the dressing before I put it on my salad, because it was awful. I asked my parents to try it and both of them agreed it was almost a medicinal taste. I had to ask for blue cheese dressing instead. The chicken on the salad was very cold and a bit tough, which led me to realize that it was not freshly prepared for my salad. It was leftover chicken chopped into small pieces and added to my meal. Seriously, Spice, you could make me a fresh chicken breast. It would greatly improve the meal. \\n\\nThe service was fine and pretty helpful overall. They had a tendency to fill our drinks to the very brim, which caused some messes, but our server was attentive about the drinks. i am not in a huge rush to come here again, but I may be open to trying it in the future in the hope things will improve!"},{"name":"P&R Restaurant And Ice Cream Parlor","address":"208 Dudley St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Glad to see another P&R popping up around Boston.

(Drinks were ordered later.)  In the flurry of settling kids down to a meal and parking our belongings, I didn't even notice right away, but the kids were never given their drinks.  We were never prompted that drinks came with the kids meals when we ordered.  I had to ask after the meal arrived when my child pointed out that she never got water at all.  That's when we noticed that the youngest in our party (4 yrs old) had a tall glass full of water in his spot but the other kids didn't have anything.  One in our party ordered a pasta meal and the other 3 adults shared the mezzo metro (the largest pizza- at $41 for \\"3-5 people\\") and salad.  The pasta came out first but no salad and no meal/kids meal for the rest of us.  (She felt bad, so she shared.)  We waited...  We never got bread and oil- something I didn't notice until I was revived with food, because, you're at Disney, you expect good service, you're tired at the end if the day,  was I supposed to be reminding the staff to do their job? No water, no bread, and a less than good attitude from the server?  The food was good, tho on the salty side, but the lackluster service put a damper on the experience.

Let's get down to business with this review.  Be Our Guest is a great restaurant.  It's not a 5-star high-end restaurant (i.e. Victoria & Alberts) and it's not a 4-star restaurant (i.e. Flying Fish), it's a QUICK SERVICE restaurant inside a theme park.  In terms of quick service, it doesn't get any better than this and there is no other restaurant in Magic Kingdom that compares.\\n\\nThe ambiance is beautiful.  If you're a fan of the movie, you'll enjoy all the fine details that the creators of this restaurant meticulously spread throughout the restaurant.  You can't deny the fact that the restaurant is GORGEOUS.  The gorgeous chandeliers, the Beast sculptures, the armored guards (they speak and some even snore), the mosaic painting of the Belle and Beast, the \\"snow\\".  These are things that perhaps a child wouldn't appreciate, but those of us who are still kids at heart find these details very impressive.\\n\\nThe food is like no other in the park.  You won't find chicken nuggets and burgers here (thankfully!)  My mom and I ordered the French Onion Soup, which was quite devine.  Not the best I've ever had but pretty darn good.  We each also ordered the Croque Monsieur, which was a nice addition to my meal.  For dessert I ordered \\"The Master's Cupcake\\" which is a delicious spongy chocolate cupcake topped with the famous \\"Grey Stuff\\".  You might remember the scene where Lumiere sings \\"try the grey stuff, it's delicious.  Don't believe me, ask the dishes.\\" Well the famous Grey Stuff tastes like a fluffy mix between chocolate and vanilla.  I enjoyed this cupcake very very much.  My mom had the Lemon Meringue Cupcake.  She says it was really good.  I can't tell you if that's true because she devoured it before I had a chance to taste it.

This is some of the best 'cue you'll find in the entire metro region; it'd be a shame if they couldn't have made the transition from food cart and catering.\\n\\n\\nGotta be honest, I wasn't crazy about the choice of location for the B&M--- it's right across the street from where the food cart called home for over 7 years. But there is no way to see this place, coming from either direction on SE 82nd. Interestingly, the Bajito Taqueria that shares the same building has a big neon sign hanging on the wall in back, facing Home Depot, but Hog Wild Doesn't get to hang a sign out front, along side Bajito? So with no sign out front, you'll only see it if you are already in the parking lot of Home Depot, or heading West on Johnson Creek Rd. from 205 you MIGHT see it, if your vision is sharp. Put it this way: I knew coming in what to look for, and where, and I still had a tough time finding it. I do hope they are planning on putting a big sign out on 82nd...\\n\\n\\nThe ambiance of Hog Wild also wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for a place you'd feel comfortable pulling up chairs and watching a ball game w/some pals, enjoying that glorious bbq. They DO have some nice drafts on tap, I'm very happy to see, and it's a start. But as is, the seating seems a little stiff and informal.... almost like a cafeteria. Perhaps this is what they are going for, maybe too many patrons hanging around watching NFL or MMA is not the kind of crowd they wanna pull? I haven't a clue. Seems unlikely, but the verdict is still out as far as decor goes, I'm hoping it's a work in progress.\\n\\n\\nWonderful folks @ Hog Wild, please take these comments in the constructive spirit in which they were intended.

Though I cannot attest to the \\"authenticity\\" of the food, I can say this about the taste:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nWe had the chips and salsa to start. The chips were fresh and crisp while the salsa was made in front of us...by which I mean they had a base salsa and asked which type of dried spices we wanted to mix in.  We decided on the hot salsa which wasn't overpowering and still had a slight sweetness to it. \\n\\nEntrees:\\nI ordered the tacos, which to my surprise were quite seasoned. The taste was similar to a Taco Bell beef taco, if Taco Bell tasted like real meat. I was accompanied by 2 guys from El Paso at the restaurant who were both craving menudo. According to them, the menudo was lacking in oregano and hominy. They were also surprised that it was not served with bread. The servers accommodated us with tortillas, however.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nThe reason I include this category is simply to say I ordered the unsweetened tea. This is a risky choice as usually one ends up with bitter and watered down tasting tea. However, Casa Chapala had great tea that was flavorful even without the sugar.\\n\\nOverall this was a nice dining experience.

We decided on Via Napoli because pizza sounded better to us than a really heavy dish of pasta from Tutto Italia. We didn't have an ADR (Advanced Dining Reservation) so we had to wait in a stand-by line for dinner. We waited about 20-30 minutes before we were seated, but I'm not complaining because, hey, we were seated! Several people got turned away since it was so near to park closing. We sat at a small table near the window and were given menus and water. Our server came by and I ordered a pomegranate cosmopolitan, and we also ordered a caprese salad, as well as a large Margherita pizza. The cosmo was DELICIOUS. I love pomegranate drinks and this one will definitely be on my must-drink list next time I visit. The pomegranate flavor was very sweet, and they did not cheap out on the booze. I was feeling pretty tipsy after just the one, and it wasn't small either. Pretty good for a $9 cocktail. \\n\\n   The bread and salad arrived and both were delicious. The bread had a nice, buttery crust that was hard with a soft, chewy interior. I didn't even use olive oil on it. The caprese salad was different than what you would usually get at an Italian restaurant. It was just mozzarella slices layered with tomato slices on a plate drizzled with olive oil and garnished with a small sprig of basil. It was one of the best things I have eaten at Walt Disney World. The mozzarella was made in house and they serve you large, thick cuts of it. The tomato slices were equally as big and were so ripe and juicy. I loved having the olive oil on instead of balsamic because it complemented the natural flavors of the cheese/tomato, instead of just masking like balsamic usually does. I could have eaten just a huge caprese salad, but I was very excited to eat the pizza! \\n\\n   The pizza came promptly and was very hot. There was not a lot of basil on the pizza, but there was tons of cheese! The sauce was a very sweet, not too thick tomato sauce that I just loved. The crust was perfect, thin enough for Italian authenticity, but very chewy and flavorful. I might be a Chicago girl, but thin crust pizza is the only pizza for me!The slices were huge so we had tons left over. \\n\\n   We were both wearing birthday buttons, so the waitstaff surprised us with a dessert and birthday song! We both received a sweet little madeleine, topped with raspberry and chocolate sauce, as well as whipped cream. Wow! What a great little dessert. So perfectly sweet and the sauces complemented them wonderfully. In all, the meal was a complete success from start to finish. My one grievance was just that our server took a long time to get our check to us after we were finished because she was socializing with guests a few tables over. Didn't detract from the experience at all, just a nuisance since we wanted to watch \\"Illuminations.\\" I will definitely return if I want non-chain pizza at WDW again, since everywhere else is frozen pizza that tastes like cardboard.

Oddly enough though, when we had called to inquire about reservations earlier in the day, the host on the phone told us that there were no more reservations available for that evening. Upon walking in and putting down our name on the wait list, the wait was only about 20-30 minutes. The only thing that sucks is that you HAVE TO wait on the bridge otherwise the pager doesn't work. \\n\\nOnce inside and seated at the table, we looked over the menu and everything looked so good. The selection isn't too extensive so it doesnt take too long to decide on an entree. The decor inside makes you feel like you're actually inside the Beast's castle!

I wish they put on some kind of show during dinner though or had characters or the dishes from the movie dancing along the balcony above the dining room. THAT would've been the final touch to making this dining experience magical.\\n\\nI ordered the Braised Pork for dinner. Unfortunately with my food allergies, our waiter had to get the head chef to come out and talk to me. He made sure to modify the dish so that I wouldn't die but at the same time the dish wouldn't be super bland/dry either. He was such a sweetheart taking the time to go over everything and even coming back out to let me know he forgot one of the sauces had dairy in it and that he would switch it to a different sauce. I REALLY APPRECIATE when a waitstaff or chef does that. It shows REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! \\n\\nThe food itself was actually really good and full of flavor!

The salsa was really tasty as well. \\n\\nI ordered the Enchiladas Veracruz, which were stuffed with chicken, spinach and cheese, and topped with marinated vegetables. My boyfriend had the Enchilada de Espinaca, which were filled with cheese, spinach and mushrooms, and topped with a cream sauce.

We were able to quickly get a table given the late hour, but the establishment was still filled with quite a few patrons. I ordered the margherita pizza and the pork shank. The wife ordered pasta, presuming it came with a simple protein for the price. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. First was the pizza, which seemed like decent appetizer, though in all fairness we were famished. Then came the entrees. The wife found that here pasta was merely over-priced without any protein, and this might be attributable to a confusing menu. Nevertheless, I won't ding the restaurant over that, as we didn't confirm what the pasta included with our server. The lackluster, proteinless pasta led to the wife's immediate envy of my huge pork shank, which I gladly shared. Overall, the food was good, even with the over-priced pasta and the general high cost of the plates (Boston markup, for sure). The restaurant ambiance and service were equally agreeable. If I was downtown and wanted to eat at an upscale establishment, I'd definitely consider Teatro again. It's a good option among many disappointments on the Boston restaurant scene."},{"name":"Watch City Brewing Co","address":"256 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"A nice brew pub.

Seema's fit that bill to the T.  Though the food is average - a couple unimpressive dishes surrounded by a couple gems - the service brings it down from a 3-star to a 2.  The first sentence out of the owner's mouth (who happened to be serving us) was \\"are you ready to order?\\"   No attempt at a greeting, small-talk, niceties... nothing.  Food took about 45 mins to come out even though ours was one of the 3 tables that were occupied at the time.  Being a small biz owner myself, I hate to write a negative review, but Seema's service, as well as most ethnic restaurants in general, is absolutely deplorable and this epidemic needs to be brought to the forefront.  The greeting wasn't the only faux pas: first drink (including water) took 15 mins to reach the table, and that only after a reminder; we asked that food be brought out as it got ready since we were not only hungry but also in a rush, it all came to us at once 45 minutes after our arrival; water glasses only get filled when we pretty flailed our arms; music was way too loud; windows were dirty.  After the owner took our order, the waitress (literally first day on the job) couldnt have been nicer, but she needed to be trained properly but clearly wasn't going to get it from the owner.  At one point we saw the owner openly scolding her while they both stood on opposite sides of an occupied table - nice touch.\\n\\nFood is okay, a bit under-spiced for my taste but authentic, but unfortunately, so was the service."},{"name":"FINO Restaurant Patio & Bar","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Are you stuck in rush hour traffic on Lamar?

When we lived in Berkeley, we used to frequent an Indian place that offered freshly made naan wraps.  When we found out that we live near a place in Vancouver that offers the same thing, we just had to try it.\\n\\nWe ordered two combos which came with a naan wrap, vegetable samosa, and a drink.  In total, the cost was $25, which was really expensive!  In Berkeley, we paid half of that for the exact same thing.  What got me is that they don't have a tandoor oven.  They just reheat the naan in an oven, which is really disappointing.  It also took almost 10 minutes for them to make our wraps, even though the cashier said it would be only a few minutes and there was no one else there.  There was a guy standing around behind the counter texting on his cell phone, which annoyed me more than anything because he could have at least greeted us or helped out his coworker or done something!  We also asked for both of our wraps to be super spicy, and mine was really bland, almost sweet.  Sweet does not equal spicy, not even close.  I was full from the wrap, but the amount of disappointment I felt was mind-blowing.  \\n\\nI did enjoy the vegetable samosa.  It was really crispy and was really flavorful.  It didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce though.  I am giving Rasoee 2 stars instead of 1 star simply because I enjoyed the samosa.  \\n\\nYeah, I won't be going back anytime soon.

I get cravings for their 'savoury lamb soup' -- I have it with cut (aka knife-sliced) noodles which are essentially peeled using a knife from a ball of noodle dough and retain a beautiful mouthfeel because of their irregular shape (think al dente with a twist). This soup has a perfectly balanced broth with delicately sweet suichoi cabbage. The handmade dumplings are incredible - I've tried both the lamb and vegetarian (bokchoy, mushroom, tofu, carrot). The chive pockets are wonderful: baked (?) dumpling on the outside, naturally sweet and juicy chives on the inside. Even the mundane sounding items are fantastic (e.g. tomato and scrambled egg on rice). I like the cat ear stir fried noodles with pork/veg -- they describe it as \\"Chinese gnocchi\\" which I think is a good analogy. Cat Ear Stir-Fried Noodles.

My mom ordered a spicy sausage that was crisp on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside.  She also had a cup of the tripe soup, which was very flavorful and served with vinegar and garlic butter, which we were told was traditional.  My mother's boyfriend ordered the special -- today was macaroni and cheese with served with vegetables, french bread, and sausage.  The boyfriend is vegetarian, though, so instead, they gave, with no extra charge, a cup of lentil soup and an extra helping of macaroni and cheese in exchange for the sausages.  \\n\\nThe highlight for me was my mother's tripe soup, which was really flavorful, especially with the vinegar and garlic butter (if you're feeling daring).\\n\\nEveryone was delighted with their food.

The best Cajun cooks know how to balance the natural taste of a particular food with the seasonings that complement it and provide a great flavor.

Just like the rest of the reviewers, it isn't every day you hear about a restaurant that shares room with a car detail shop, but when we arrived it was a nice little cafe and once inside you quickly forget what's next door. \\n\\nIt is a family run business, and the staff were friendly enough.\\n\\nOne thing, the place is not air conditioned so just pretend you are actually in Lima or something as it feels about the same. \\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes, I have posted photos of each.\\n\\nThe first was the Huancaina, a boiled potato covered in the Aji sauce. It is a nice but very rich sauce that has a very very mild pepper flavour. Very tasty and very rich.\\n\\nThe second item we ordered was the Ceviche de Pescado. I'm a huuge ceviche fan and make my own quite often. This ceviche was delicious, The marinade they use has a very peppery and spicy flavour on top of the freshness of the lime. The fish was more on the raw side than I have had before as it was probably made that morning. It was perfect though, like a flavorful sashimi. I think it was tuna.  I highly recommend this dish as a shared appetizer with another person, but don't hesitate to be selfish either. \\n\\nFor the entrees My fiancee had the Arroz con Mariscos, it is basically fried rice with seafood mixed in with sauce and spices. It is one of the type of Peruvian dishes heavily Chinese influenced like many foods in the country. It was very good though and tasted thuroughly asian, but with a small South American edge. The seafood was cooked well but some parts of it, especially the shellfish was a little too firm and overcooked.\\n\\nI had the Chupe de Mariscos. It is kind of a stew/soup mix with a lot of broth and big chunks and varieties of seafood mixed in with a pile of rice inside. It was delicious, the broth was a creamy/peppery mix and tasted amazing. I ate the whole thing and still wanted more. \\n\\nI was originally planning to order the Aji de Gallina but they didn't have any but I'm glad I ended up getting this instead. \\n\\nThe restaurant does have a small menu, but that means they are able to focus on certain items.

When you factor in the food and service, that's where my rating seemed to take a nosedive.  We arrived about 20 minutes early for a 6:00 dinner reservation and were told to return in five minutes when it was within 15 minutes of our reservation.  No big deal, we walked around and came back and checked in.  We were seated promptly in the ballroom and were amazed, like most, at the attention to detail and how well themed it was.  Our server was slightly confused most of the night and kept mixing our table up with another and kept reminding us of the fact for the majority of the night.  The food was so-so.  I ordered the salmon, which I enjoyed.  Two others ordered the seafood in the puff pastry and it was mediocre.  Not a lot of flavor and nothing to write home about.  The fourth ordered the strip steak and it was not a choice cut of meat by any stretch.  I was wondering if some of the horsemeat in Europe had found it's way to this French eatery.  After our main course, we mentioned we were celebrating two birthdays and the waitress said she could put something together.  I guess this meant she would wheel the dessert cart over because there was nothing special to note.  After our TIW discount, the total for four with tip was $170.  For that price, there are better options that maybe don't quite have the theming, but a much improved quality of food.  It is 5 star atmosphere with 1-2 star food and service.  We had reservations when we return in July and just recently cancelled them.  We still have a reservation for August which we retained only because one child had not eaten there with us.

But then about 15 minutes later there was a sudden steady flow of people coming in - it's clearly a popular place.  We were in a group of 5 and grabbed a table.  It's quite a basic setting, order at the counter and food is served in paper plates if you're dining in - it's obviously not about the setting but the food.  We ordered the Chicken 65, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Seekh Kebob, Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer and off course biryani - Mutton, Chicken and Vege.\\n\\nAppetizers\\nChicken 65 ($6.69) - This is a typical dish you get with biryani, it was done well and very tasty.\\nChicken Seekh Kebob ($6.69) - Had good flavour but preferred the 65.\\nTandoori Chicken ($4.49) - Really good marination, this was probably the best of the appetizers. It's spicy but just the right amount, although it might be a bit extra for some.\\n\\nMains\\nChicken Tikka Masala ($6.99) - Decent but I've had better CTM.  Was a bit small quantity wise and hardly any chicken pieces - it's more of an appetizer size.\\nSaag Paneer ($6.49) - Was alright, the vegetarians at the table loved it.\\nBiryani ($7.49 Mutton & Chicken, $6.49 Vege) - The Mutton biryani was really good, we asked for double masala for both meat biryanis and I could taste it more in the mutton.  The meat is very tender and had soaked in the masala flavour.  The chicken was good too but enjoyed the mutton more.  I just had a spoon of the Vege and it was ok, more of a meat person - especially with biryani but I'm not sure if they asked for double masala for the vege.  There's slightly a bit more oil or ghee in the biryani, but that's normal for biryani not made at home.  This still doesn't beat a good home-made biryani, but has been the best I've tried outside here in ATL so far.\\n\\nQuantity - we ordered quite a bit so I was full, but the quantity sizes are a bit small - especially the curries.\\nAmbience - It's well-lit, food court style setting.  Decent amount of tables and chairs and food is served on a tray with plastic plates, I can see it getting crowded though on the weekend, so takeaway would be a better option.  The ordering style is a bit messy, and it can get pretty loud so you need to really concentrate.\\nService - It's self-service, so no need to tip!\\nSpice - Pretty good - say a 3.5/5, I think they can make it a bit more spicy but out of our control as it's pre-made.\\nTaste - Overall, it was good and we did try a few different things to get an overview of the place.  Biryani is the main thing you'd come here for as I've had better tasting curries from other places.  Tandoori chicken and chicken 65 were good too.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, there's always a slightly different taste with outside biryani, I haven't been able to find a place which doesn't have that yet.

The place itself is visually appealing.  The seating was a little too cozy for comfort; we were seated next to a couple celebrating a birthday, and while we don't mind PDA, we unwillingly overheard... too much. Next time we'll request a separate table, not a table up against the long booth.\\n\\nThe by-the-glass wine selection was smaller than expected.  We ordered the fried goat cheese to start.  It was interesting!  The breading is not what you'd expect (like Malaga's, or in Alamo's gc salad), and along with the table bread/crackers it was good.\\n\\nEntrees: he ordered the vegetarian ravioli and I the beef strip steak.  It is a huge piece of steak, with just a mushroom garnish.  I quietly wished I had ordered something with more diversity in flavor, with sides.  I had asked for medium-well, but the thing was bright red inside.  Luckily it was still yummy.  His dish was great, but we both agreed the food was overall more salty than it was seasoned.  Throughout, the waiter refilled my water/his iced tea once, though they were empty for some time. Hmm.\\n\\nThis is where things get messy: the coupon from restaurants.com was obviously not what the waiter wanted to see.  My usually-oblivious partner confirmed this.  When he brought out the check, he pointed out that he didn't include the usually mandatory 18% gratuity and was leaving it up to us.  Given his attitude, I didn't want to leave him anything (but my partner left a nice tip to show no hard feelings).  You'd think the staff would be aware of possible coupons and not act so annoyed by them.

The food is somewhere between bad and mediocre which is not surprising if it is turned out in a filthy environment.  Do I think it is gonna kill me?

It just happened that I had to go to a store down there and saw that this place wasn't busy and decided to drop in quickly. This place is absolutely amazing. The owner Spiros was such a gentleman. \\n\\nI ordered the soup and wrap for 8.99 including tax. What i got was enough for lunch AND dinner. He talked to me about how he makes his own hot sauce and hand picks the meats he uses from the butcher. Absolutely everything in this place was handmade. It is rare to find somewhere that the owner serves you and prepares the food with so much pride and care. The lettuce was crispy, the wrap was filled with goodness as if it was prepared for a Greek God. \\n\\nHe even takes the time to hand make his own pickled turnips he puts in the wrap. I honestly could not believe I have been working in this neighbourhood and not know he has been here for 8 months. This guy is truly a Greek. He has photos of his youth where he worked at restaurants in Greece. \\n\\nAfter commenting how amazing his food was he started telling me how i had to try his hummus. Free of charge he brought a bowl of home made hummus, absolutely the best I have ever tasted in my life along with fresh pita. After saying how amazing that was he told me I had to try his rice with home-made tzatziki sauce. By the time I left he was beaming with pride having offered me a sample of everything he had on the menu.

When I worked near the airport, our office would love to do a Johnny's lunch. \\n\\nUnfortunately, in the past year and a half or so, things have really gone down hill. Even before they changed the menu, the food was on a path to sub-par. Things that were supposed to be hot were cold...things that were supposed to be crispy were soggy, etc....\\n\\nTHEN they had to go and change the menu. Prices have gone up while quality and options have gone down. They've botched our orders up a few times in the past year and since we don't eat it till we get home, it's not worth it to go back out and ask for a new order. I can forgive a mistake here or there but it seems to be a trend now. Two that come to my mind are the horribly undercooked hotdog and the grilled cheese pannini I got tonight: the bread was hard and the cheese was equally hard and cold. I actually put it in my toaster before I ate it and don't plan on eating the other half. We don't call ahead: my husband orders at the counter when he gets there, so there's no reason for it to be cold...it never was a few years ago. \\n\\nSo for menu changes and prices: they removed all the cold subs. Maybe they weren't selling but I sure do miss the chicken salad sub. As I said, the prices have increased and they used to let you choose from a few different sides. The \\"standard\\" side was house-made chips with their awesome dip OR you could choose another side....so along with their price increases, you now have to pay extra for a side other than chips AND have to pay extra for the dip! Oh, and the chips tonight...thick slices of old cardboard. They used to be really thin and crispy, even good the next day...but I don't even want these right from the restaurant tonight. \\n\\nThe last nail in the coffin is the service. The past three times my husband has been there, he said he pretty much felt like he was a thorn in the cashier's side. He's not the type of guy to complain so if he says something like that, it's the real deal. \\n\\nSorry Johnny's, but we're done. Thanks for the memories. I'd probably give you just one star but that extra star is for good luck in hopes you'll change.

You have too many delicious things to choose from, or have to examine each item's price first so as not to overspend, or you must make sure not to copy what your date gets because you suspect he has better taste than you... Here, the $25 fixed-price menu gives you a choice of pate, soup, or salad, choice of two entrees, and choice of three desserts. This virtually eliminates all menu-related concerns since they're all guaranteed to be amazing.\\n\\nMy boyfriend's salmon pate was delicate, my chilled cucumber soup was excellent, but the star of the meal was definitely our main course of steak. When it first arrived, topped with herbed butter, I thought it was a surprisingly small portion. But the steak was so thick and perfectly-cooked that ended up being quite filling. The green beans on the side were the best I've ever had, and not dreadfully overcooked and squishy (as green beans tend to be). By the time we got to dessert - creme caramel and a chocolate mousse - I was stuffed and could barely finish half of mine, but it was still quite good.\\n\\nThe only downside - and I literally mean the only downside to this place - was that the restaurant was so small that the tables were pretty close together, and it got noisy.

Nice interior, we were sat right away. Didn't care for the trendy music, except for the one Toni Braxton song that came on. This place needs throaty, female singers and a little jazz/funk, not repetitive electronica. Anyway, it did end up getting REALLY loud in there, so you couldn't hear it anymore anyway. Now the food...we started with a Russian River Pinot Noir to drink, it was OK, probably a $10-$15 bottle at a package store, easy to drink, but nothing to rave about. We selected the fresh ricotta and figs for our app. These are small plates, only 1 slice of toasted bread served with the figs and cheese, so we used the table bread. The fig skins were a bit too smoky for my liking, so we scooped out the flesh. The cheese was great, but could have been heightened a bit with a dash of salt on top. We had the arugula salads, and they were tasty (Finz still has it on the arugula salad in my opinion though). For the entr√©e I had to garganelli. OMG fantastic! The duck meat was amazing, and the cherries...OMG the cherries! Pasta was just a touch too al dente for me, but overall, the comprised meal was great.

While the demi tea seems like a great alternative for the less hungry, be warned that Neverland has a pretty militant \\"NO SUBSTITUTIONS\\" policy for only the demi tea. I'm still scratching my head about this as one of my friends was allergic to some things on the demi menu and had no choice but to order the pricier full tea just so she could switch items for things she could eat. While it seems Neverland accommodates gluten/dairy free diets (her allergies are to nuts and other things), apparently, not all cream puffs are created equal. \\n\\nThe food was excellent overall - you can view the menu here: http://neverlandtea.com/pdf/neverland_high_tea.pdf. To me, the sandwiches were the standouts and the aforementioned cream puffs (no longer on the menu) were delicious. However, the rest of the desserts were just average and not very inspired; especially disappointing were the cookies with the stale jam \\"thumbprints\\". \\n\\nPortions were substantial and anything but dainty, but I'm a sucker for anything on a tiered china plate - it makes the gluttony seem more delicate and refined. That definitely helped compensate for how cramped it is.

Not sure if it's supposed to come like that but it was average.\\n\\nMain course:\\n-salmon au crabe- this was delicious! The salmon was cooked with a super crispy skin and the sauce was a great match! If I had to guess the sauce has a mayonnaise base. The crab meat was a refreshing touch to the whole meal. It also came with squash and red cabbage slices, hush puppies (kinda weird), and tomatoes.\\n-duck confit- the duck reminded me of Cantonese duck you get at Asian restaurants. The meat fell off the bone and the skin was also very crispy. It has a little bit too much fat, but it's unavoidable due to it being the legs. It also came with apricot chutney which was a sweet tangy twist to the overall meal. Did not care too much for the pair. The veggies were the same as the salmon but no tomatoes.\\n\\nDessert:\\n-meringue island- hmm not my favorite due to the texture. I've never had meringue before but for those of you not familiar what it is, it's egg white whipped very quickly to solidify.

I tried some of the rigatoni as well and that was also nicely done.  The chicken milanese and fish dishes came in generous portions with the former having exceptionally light breading and texture.  However, the flavor for both was a bit on the bland side so there's definitely still room for improvement.  The tiramisu was my favorite of the dishes - one of the best I've tried and served as a perfect finish to the meal.\\n\\nAs for the wine, I went with the waitress's recommendations and tried the 2007 Marrema Alta \\"Micante\\" Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon blend and the 2006 Vietti \\"Perbacco\\" Nebbiolo Langhe, both from Italy.  The former was medium-bodied, very smooth and brimming with berries.  The latter was more full-bodied with an earthy and mildly spicy finish.  They complimented my food well and it was nice being to taste some of both before ordering the glass.\\n\\nOverall, Teatro's a very good choice for Italian fare especially considering its proximity to school.

Nothing on my plate needed seasoning...which is interesting considering potatoes tend to be over or under seasoned. Bravo Chez Nous!\\nOn my husband's plate was a croque monsieur. It was cheesy, warm, and tasty. I make my own croque monsieur's at home and I should start charging nine dollars for my sandwiches.....Chez Nous does it and mine are just as tasty. :) The side salad was fresh...but nothing outstanding. \\nThe chocolate mousse was a hefty bowl of creamy yumminess.

It's a bit hidden, close to the rail tracks. We went in, and it was definitely something of a change as far as caf√©s go. It was a bit dark-ish and dingy, with original art all over the walls, and some very eclectic-types sitting around, lounging, on the internet or having conversation. It was quite a nice atmosphere.\\n\\nI just ordered a garlic bagel with cream cheese, since nothing on the menu moved me. One of the guys ordered a spinach empanada with a chipotle sauce and a spicy corn soup. The other one ordered a ham sandwich and a hot chocolate. We all enjoyed our food.

That's not to say that I didn't eat the whole thing and that I didn't have some enjoyment from the whole experience.  I just think that with significantly less salt, the burger would have shined just fine.  A high point of the burger was the bun.

Unfortunately from the moment I ordered to the time I received the food there were red flags.  Firstly, we placed a take out order on Friday evening of Labor Day weekend.  While ordering I was put on hold 4 separate times.  After placing my order for 1 vegetarian dish + soda + tea, the person on the line asked me what I wanted ~ I suppose he forgot or didn't write it down after I told him? Anyway, I re-ordered and was told it would arrive in 15-20 minutes (the restaurant is less than 2 miles away) ~ this was fine with  me.  I confirmed the address and paid via credit card.  30 min. later I called to confirm the driver didn't get lost and was told he was on his way and knew exactly where I lived.  15 minutes later I get a call from the driver confused about our address.  I  told him again where it was and opened the door so he could see me waiting outside.  We received our food, except one of the drinks was missing.  After paying over $25 for 1 meal, I was a little peeved.  I called and asked them about my missing drink and they said they were busy.  No apology, just that they were busy.  ??? After all of this, we hoped the food tasted good ~ naan was cold, matar paneer tasted off, and the soda was warm.  The dal makhani was good (not great, but definitely more edible than the rest). Poor service, sub-par food, and lengthy delivery service means this is the first and last time I will ever order from here.

I was charmed already by the name (Ah-Ma means grandmother in Chinese/Taiwanese). I can say definitively that Ah Ma's did not disappoint!\\n\\nI'm half Taiwanese so I know first hand how amazing a good ole Taiwanese meal can be..Probably the most said thing to me once people find out I haven't been to Taiwan (yet!) is how amazing the food is there, so to reiterate the standards I had for Ah-Ma were high.\\n\\nIf you've ever been to the space's previous tenant - Rice Box - the transformation is even more impressive; the decor is sleek and modern with Chinese influence. It is still quite small, so the wait for a table can be a little long if they're busy. The staff is great however, and are quite proactive about seating people, which helped a great deal with our wait time. \\n\\nWe ordered quite a few dishes, as pretty much everything sounded well, amaze balls (there's really no other way to put it). Here's a quick rundown of everything we had:\\n\\n-Stuffed Chicken Wings: Now you might ask, how the heck do you stuff a chicken wing?! I have no idea, but it was delicious; without a doubt one of my favorite dishes. Taiwanese Fried Chicken is one of my favorite dishes in general and Ah-Ma's certainly does a pretty good version, and biting into the chicken there's rice, hot and steaming flavored rice! YUM. So so so good. Highly recommend.\\n\\n-Egg Drop Soup: This is a little different from the versions that are served in \\"traditional\\" Chinese restaurants, I found it a bit on the bland side.\\n\\n-Wonton Soup: I enjoyed this much more, they don't skimp on the dumplings either, it's an ideal starter!\\n\\n-Lu Rou Fan: This is one of their rice bowls, they're probably the most singularly filling items on the menu - if you're looking for an entree, the rice bowls will be your best bet. I chose the lu rou fan, as I'm quite a fan of my mom's version of it, while Ah Ma's isn't quite as good as mom's - I'll admit it's pretty tasty. Lu Rou is tender, slightly fatty pork, and again it's one of my favorite dishes! The pork was tender, very well cooked and full flavored.\\n\\n-Baos: We tried two baos, the pork belly and the dirty bird - they're both really good. Really good. The bao the perfect texture and again the proteins are perfectly cooked. Both the pork belly and dirty bird are different enough in flavor, so don't feel guilty going for both, but if you've already ordered one of the fried chicken apps, I'd skip out on the dirty bird and try the other two (the other bao offered is a veggie one). \\n\\nOverall, Ah-Ma is a wonderful addition to the Chinese/Taiwanese scene in Atlanta,  consider yourself lucky, Midtown!"},{"name":"Zaika Indian Bistro","address":"442 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Not too often I am so disappointed with the food.

The brisket was nice and tender and fell off the bone, the macaroni and cheese in my dish was decent, the corncake was flavorful, firm, and not greasy. Furthermore, the additional ingredients in my order were firm and crisp with tasty sauce drizzled over the top. I tried some of my wifes' dish and the meatball was nice and flavorful. Maybe it is the area and clientele in Grandview that they are catering to with the yoga, juice bars, and spinning classes sprouting up in the neighborhood but the portions were like fist sized portions that would make Richard Simmons, Shawn T, and Jillian Michael's proud. I believe this is what dietitians recommend portion sizes should be if trying to lose weight.

The Lu Ro Fan and the Pork Belly Bao were both very tasty.  The Salt & Pepper Chicken could have been a bit crispier, but I attribute some of the sogginess to being stuck in a take-out box on my drive back to work.  Generally speaking, the prices are fair; however, I think the handmade baos are a little overpriced ($4.5) for just one bao.  I personally don't mind paying $4.5, but would rather see these come out in kind of a slider-style serving.\\n\\nA tip here is that if you are planning on coming with a group, definitely call ahead of time to make sure they can handle your group.

The dining rooms, all 3 of them, are fabulously themed as the Beast's castle.  The dining room to the left upon entrance is a dark ominously decorated room, the dining room to the right is a bit more serene and quiet, and had a twirling Beauty and Beast in the center.  The middle masterpiece of a dining room resembles the large ballroom from the movie, complete with the beautiful oval inset ceiling and giant chandeliers, and the windows feature gorgeous falling snow.\\n\\nThe line is VERY long for lunch (we waited over an hour at peak lunch time) when you cannot make a reservation, and it's in direct sunlight.  Be prepared to switch off if you are in a group, and send someone to the front to grab a shading umbrella and to go buy cold water...You are also given menus in line so decide what you want to order (and helpful to use as a fan to cool off).  Once you get inside, you line up to go past some snoring knights of armor, and order at computer screens for your entire party.  It was a little stressful to order for all 8 people at the beginning, but since we stood in line so long, we were ready...there was a cashier keying in our order so it all went smoothly.  You are given a plastic rose GPS device that you place on the table that you choose yourself, and servers find you and bring your order to your table on a cart.  Fountain drinks and silverware are all self service at stations around the dining rooms.  \\n\\nThe food is surprising good for a theme park...I had braised pork which was a sizable portion and very tender, with tasty sides of green beans and mashed potatoes. Again, very surprised at how yummy it was...i was expecting that i would be stuck with chicken fingers and fries at Disney, so i was happy.  The kids menus are varied, which was good since we have a untypically healthy kid in our party that prefers veggies and fish over fries like another kid in the group.  Soup (du jour- french onion w/ cheese) and sandwiches (croque Monsieur) are also on the menu, since they are featured in the Be Our Guest song in the movie.  And hey, it's Disney...of course, it's more of an attraction than gourmet food, at inflated prices...but look at the menu...$2.50 for bottled Dasani water is the same as everywhere else in the park, and I've paid more at airports most of the time.

We didn't even need the dipping sauces...though I did try them just to see. Both the garlic and sesame sauces were good.

Four of us decided to give this place a try and walked in only to be ignored for 5 minutes.  When someone finally walked over to greet us, he told us it would be a 45 minute wait as they were completely busy.  This was a rather odd comment to us as we could easily see 5-6 open tables with only 7 tables occupied max.  Regardless, we weren't in any rush, so we asked if we could sit at the bar instead and were told we could.  We walked over to the bar and immediately the four cooks in the kitchen began staring at us.  When I say staring, I mean staring.  They all crowded around the small porthole window in the door to the kitchen (which just happened to be right behind the bar) and started glaring at us and even shaking their heads at us.  At first we thought maybe they were looking at someone else, or were even kidding, but as the glares persisted, it became clear we were not welcome.  It took about 10 minutes of being glared at by these cooks along with no one stopping by to even see if we wanted drinks for us to just give up.  During this time, another couple walked in to try to get a table and were promptly turned away as the angry cooks stared them down as well.  It was just incredibly odd.  When we asked to sit at the bar and were told yes, we figured it wasn't a problem, but obviously it was.  I would rather that the maitre d' would have just explained that unfortunately they couldn't help us tonight instead of letting us sit down only to be glared out of the place.  Obviously I can't speak to the food or the service since no one came to help us at all and we weren't even given a chance to order, but from what we did experience, I would not recommend Vista Bistro."},{"name":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Aww!

I'm thinking score! So I go in on a Tuesday night which its $15 a person. I'm seated only after another patron let's a staff member know there is myself and my fianc√© and 2 other people behind us waiting to be seated. (This should have been my red flag since it wasn't busy at all; but i didn't think anything of it).  We order our drinks then go grab some food.\\n\\n I tried a little of the chicken skewers, some baked salmon, some baked spinach and some honey shrimp. I enjoyed my small trial plate of food. My fianc√© tried the general Tao's chicken, fried rice, and a few other tasty morsels. The food wasn't half bad. A little on the bland side, but the baked salmon pared with the spinach tasted great to me. After both of us got a second small plate of food. We noticed a table of older gentlemen, in which one got up to go get more food (already eaten on plate in hand and used fork on his plate like he was going back to his own kitchen for seconds). He proceeded to dish up several different things onto his plate, having the buffet utensils touch his plate and used fork, then stick the utensil back into the buffet tray. I said something about this quite loudly to my fianc√© and mentioned my concern to the waitress. And yet not more than a minute after the first gentleman sat down another from the same table got up with his plate the same way and started over to the buffet to do the same thing. The waitress stopped and stared but never mentioned that this is not allowed to the second man.\\n\\n So we got up and left in disgust. My fianc√© mentioned this issue with the situation to the manager only to have the response of \\"Ok... Will keep and eye out\\"...  Wait, what? No \\"thank you for letting us know\\", \\"sorry, we will look into it.\\" No, he didn't care at all! FYI- I believe this is a health violation for a buffet and they need to keep on top of this. But also we saw another health code violation before leaving which was several buckets and strong cleaning supplies bring kept under the heating tables.

Factoring that out, the food is decent but less than amazing, IMO a bit overpriced for the quality.\\n\\nI decided to try out Sugidama because I love Japanese food, and found it nice that it serves soba as its main category. I guess I was hoping it'd be like an across-the-river version of Shiki.\\n\\nFirst, I tried the hamachi and tamago sushi -- which weren't bad, but not the best for the price. Not a snob but I could notice that the rice wasn't pressed enough.\\n\\nTo get a glimpse of the noodles and home-made dipping sauce, I tried the zaru soba. It was okay -- I guess you can't really go wrong with this. On the other hand, it wasn't too different from what I cook at home with the store-bought concentrate. Not the depth of flavor that I expected for the price. My other half got with his soba the ebi kakiage, which had been too drenched in oil. Again, not bad, but not great. \\n\\nIf you grew up eating soba and know how to prep it at home, don't bother trying the zaru soba. But if you've never had soba, go ahead for the experience! \\n\\nOverall, Sugidama offers a neat Japanese food experience for those who'd like to learn more. Not so sure for those who've been to a lot of Japanese restaurants in their lifetime. I felt like it wavers between being a chic restaurant and a joint at Lesley/Porter Square. Perhaps (and I hope) somewhere in between is where it aims to be, but it felt awkward at first impression.\\n\\nP.S. Just my two cents (minor, really) about the atmosphere. The interior has a clean and simple feel, as is the presentation of dishes. It seems to have many of the right features -- of the near-minimalistic, Muji-inspired kind one would find at Japanese stores -- and achieves it only so closely. At a glance it's almost there, certainly the only one of its kind in Davis.

Aside from that it was again flavorless, mostly large chunks of tomatoes with a couple chunks of beef. It was just greasy watery tomato soup with some beef.

Nice tender, cooked in a mountain of grease and mixed with some herbs. Not too shabby for cabbage.\\n\\nBacon wrapped dates, I LOVE bacon wrapped dates. But not theirs. Cold and low quality ingredients have ruined this amazing paleo snack. \\n\\nLast thing I ordered was the Chicken strips.

I enjoyed the experience though it's not without it's faults. The ambiance and chance to enter the park early is worth the price of admission to me but may not be to others. \\n\\nBreakfast is not cheap - you should expect to pay 20-25 per adult, and 10 or so per child for your meal, which includes a drink, entree and a shared platter of pastries. Breakfast is quick serve, so you order at a kiosk, sit down, and your meal magically appears about 10 minutes later. There are 10 or so options and not really a way to customize anything so be prepared for that. I tried the open faced baguette sandwich, my husband had the croque madame, and my kids had the french toast and the crepe. My sandwich was good. The eggs could have been a bit more well done (in fact, if it was a regular place, I would have sent them back but I just ate them because, well, we didn't have the luxury of time or anyone to ask!). Overall it was a tasty and filling meal. My husband's was better though - that bechamel is great! One son loved the (pretty standard looking) french toast. The other hated the crepes. Again, didn't really do anything about that, he just thought the yogurt was too sour. So I wouldn't recommend that meal. The pastries are just OK but no one had a problem eating them. It is nice that you get your own drinks and it's really not policed so you could easily have a coffee and then switch to a Coke later on. Just saying.\\n\\nOverall, it was a good experience to eat in the castle, get in the park early and wasn't THAT much more than other breakfast options could have been in the park.

The place is in the Traders Joe plaza and is tuck in a corner. Interior wise, it is pretty small, but decorated nicely. You have the long wrap around bench on one side (next to the window) and then you have chairs (black & red) on the rest for sitting. What we ordered::\\n\\n- Veggies Bao: one of the fave we tried. It has tofu in it along with other veggies such as cilantro, mushroom, shredded pickled carrots & daikon and was cooked well. Personally, it the sauce was a bit too much hence made it a bit too salty, but otherwise it is fine. Will definitely get this again.\\n\\n- Dirty Bird Bao: another fave. It has chicken as the meat along with other veggies including the shredded pickled carrots & daikons. The pickled carrots & daikons made it a bit too sour for our taste, but again, it sill tasted good. Would definitely get this again. Wonder why it's call dirty bird.\\n\\n- Beef Noodle Soup: It tasted at most okay. It's decent for a meal. The noodles were a bit chewy and the beef was a bit too dried when we chewing it. I like the veggies inside of it. The broth was good, but a bit oily for me.\\n\\n- Fried Chicken Wings stuff two ways: You get 2 chicken pieces (1 wing & 1 drum) The wing get stuff with sticky rice & some other stuff in there. The drum doesn't get any stuffing, so it was just normal drum. This dish was okay at most. Our chicken were a little burnt as it was extra extra crunchy (and a bit hard).\\n\\n- Ice Cream Bao (w/ no peanuts): We got this with the coffee ice cream (didn't got to choose our flavors :( ) We thought that it would be like fried ice cream (where the dough is wrap around the ice cream and get fried for a bit for that fried texture dough on the outside), but it wasn't the case. The bao dough (same dough/bao as the other baos) are fried and then fold in half to allow the ice cream to sit in it. It is almost like an ice cream sandwich. The flavor of the coffee ice cream was really strong in coffee thus it over power the bao. Our bao came out hard unfortunately so we couldn't bite into it. Personally, I would not do coffee ice cream with this, just because the combination does not go well together. If they were to have it with coffee ice cream, I would recommend to add chocolate drizzle or something to counteract that strong coffee taste. We would probably order this again, but not with coffee ice cream.\\n\\nPrice wise, it's pretty cheap to eat as it's priced around the same as other taiwanese places in the OPT/IPT area.

The food is solidly a five. And for many years the service was also a five. But the last few years, the service has been spotty at best. The service is more like a 2 or 3.  The food is still delicious and fresh and full of flavor, but the experience the last three or four times I've been there has been soured somewhat to downright ruined by the service.  The hosts and hostesses are always friendly and smiling, and even though we have reservations, we have to wait a few minutes for the table; the hosts and hostesses make it very pleasant. I'm not sure what happens once we sit down at the table, but each server seems to be overextended at best, or down right negligent at worst. \\n\\nThere is little time for pleasantries or banter, which I'll admit I do prefer a bit of; not too much, but some conversation is nice. I served for many years, and I always appreciated the customers that actually cared enough to engage me a little. It's sad because I've also had the best service I've ever had at Jiko. Our server years ago, Mustafa was practically prescient. He could anticipate our needs before we even knew them, but wasn't obtrusive either. I mean, that particular time was something like ten years ago and I can still remember it vividly.  \\n\\nBut their dishes are still some of the most artful in all of Disney.  Most of the menu is seasonal, so it changes often, but a few dishes anchor the menu like the Inguday Tibs in Brik, which are roasted mushrooms, spinach and cheese in a delicate filo pastry with a curry vinaigrette and apple salad. It's a delicate, yet savory appetizer has earned its venerated place on the menu.  Order one of the rotating flavor flatbreads from the eponymous cooking place and you'll be treated to an interesting interplay of flavors and textures. \\n\\nAnother enduring dish is the Oak-Grilled Filet with red wine sauce. The side dishes for this seem to rotate though, but if it's offered with the macaroni and cheese, do yourself a favor an order it. There is something about the melange of grilled filet dripping mixing with the red wine sauce and the mac and cheese that just sort of dances on the tongue.  The Botswana Seswaa-style shortrib is also a marriage of savory flavors. Though the West African Koki Corn, which is something like a tamale, is an imaginative alternative for vegetarians or even part-time vegetarians like myself. \\n\\nThe desserts are my favorite part of dinner at Jiko, because their composed dishes are well-thought out and harmonious in flavor. If the Chocolate Cremeaux is in rotation; don't miss it. It's like indulging in a bowl of the creamiest, richest chocolate velvet.  Though all their desserts are artistically inspired. \\n\\nJiko is a wonderfully romantic restaurant, with whimsical decor like what looks like origami pterodactyls flying across the tall, vaulted ceilings, and the food certainly lives up to and even outshines the ambience. I just hope the service gets back to its former glory."},{"name":"The Depot","address":"904 Memorial Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Six meals ordered, two were acceptable, two were poor and two were downright bad.\\n\\nThe plus:\\n\\nThe turkey burger was good - a little charred but OK.\\nThe kids got a coloring page and crayons on arrival.\\nIt was not too hot, not too cold.\\n\\nThe minus:\\n\\nKids chicken fingers were greasy and tasteless\\nKids grilled cheese sandwich was barely grilled and over-cheesy\\nChicken sandwich was overcooked, greasy, tough and charred\\nAsian scallop salad was basically a fresh-pac garden salad with soy sauce and sesame oil.

The verdict: Close, but still not 'it.'\\n\\nLiked:\\nSteak in the burrito had good flavor, texture\\nFree (small) chips & salsa is how it should be for a taqueria\\nPapusa (revueltas) wonderfully salty and greasy\\n\\nDisliked:\\nNot enough cheese, wasn't melted\\nToo many ingredients made some bite combinations poorly distributed\\n\\nTaco Loco has a lot going for it. Unremarkable building in a fine but not great part of town, check. Wait staff who aren't 100% fluent in English, check. Completely unpretentious, CHECK! So I had fairly high expectations for the place. \\n\\nAnd the good news is that Taco Loco is pretty good. That bad news, their ($6.25) large burrito isn't 'great.' The burrito starts well by being a large, dry, flour tortilla, which was filled with Steak (my choice), rice, guacamole, onions, hot sauce, shredded cheese, black beans, crema, cilantro, and pico de gallo (which I ordered without).  That's a lot of ingredients, with only a few standouts. The cilantro wasn't overpowering and complemented the beef well, the guac and crema added great depth, and the rice had good overall flavor and melded well inside the burrito. On the other side, the beans were absent in too many bites, there was basically no cheese or hot sauce, and the onions were completely extraneous. And while the steak was good, the portion/ratio of it seemed a little light for a burrito over $6.00. \\n\\nSo while I did enjoy Taco Loco's burrito, it still suffers from the same fatal flaw that 95% of other 'Mexican' restaurants in Boston suffer from; it's run by Salvadorians. And while that makes for an awesome pupasa, finding that elusive authentic Californian-caliber burrito in Boston still eludes me."},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Chief among the many appeals of Vietnamese food are its fresh, clean flavors.

I was a barista at George Howell's Coffee Connection--a job and product I loved--when \\"*$\\" (get it?) bought out the entire small chain. They immediately set to ruining it completely and obliterating the brand. I quit the day I had to say \\"grande,\\" and I haven't set foot in a *$ since. I make it a point to only visit local places everywhere I go.\\n\\nThis new Harvard Square cafe has already lured me through its doors three times. The main hook is that they brew George Howell's coffee, Terroir. Hurrah! (Seriously, if you do coffee at all, you must taste this stuff.)\\n\\nCrema delivers on several fronts: The coffee is well-prepared and everything you'd expect it to be. It's a pleasing space, slick *and* cozy. The staff is super-friendly. The sandwich menu has some unexpected elements. And, hey, they seem to bake their own goodies and even have fresh-squeezed blood-orange juice!\\n\\nBUT, you should also note that: Ounce-for-ounce, all the drinks are pricey. The sandwiches are teeny-tiny. The food takes forever to come out. Plus, a personal pet peeve: the staff asks for a name with each order, which means having my unusual name butchered with each visit. (I know I should pick a fake name just for this purpose but am afraid I won't answer to it.)\\n\\nAll in all, Crema is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I'll definitely go back--probably within the week--but think its drawbacks will probably prevent it from becoming my regular morning stop.\\n\\nUpdate: I've upped my review by a star. The waiting time for an order seems a little lengthy still, but their coffee is just that good and their staff is just that nice. Also, they really haven't messed up my name since the first couple of times. I have not revisited the sandwich issue. \\n\\nUpdate 2: People, Crema is serious about customer service.

The waitstaff that services the upstairs certainly do not need gym memberships, they really get the workout!\\n\\nWith a genuflection to clean living, for at least one night, we skipped drinks and went to the gourmand phase.  \\n\\nWe began with the lamb appetizer, which is shaped like a biscotti.   It is breaded with a tender distinctly lamb-flavored meat inside.  The mayo-based dipping sauce was very mild.  This appetizer would have been good - and looking at my previous reviews of late I'm sounding like a broken record - but it was too dang salty.\\n\\nIs it just us, or are you coming across more highly-salty dishes of late?  Like cilantro and rosemary were the rage, now it's salt?  In any case, when the waitress asked us how it was, we told her.  She comped us for the lamb even though we told her not to, because it wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nFor a starter we had salad greens.  The lettuce was fresh and flavorable, but the vinaigrette that was drizzled on the salad wedge was very sparse, so it was really just eating lettuce plain.\\n\\nOur entrees were the roasted half chicken and the trout.\\n\\nThe way the chicken is served is so cute, with one claw pointing high to the sky as it is brought to the table, as if it were waving goodbye.  Well, it was, in a manner of speaking.  The chicken was very good, even the crunchy chicken toes.  I really liked the grated asparagus and mushrooms that accompany the chicken.\\n\\nThe trout was decent.  It had a mild quiet stuffing of couscous and bits of fruit that did provide little bursts of flavor.  The trout meat was nice and tender, but we thought the skin should have been more crispy.\\n\\nOh , the pages from a cookbook that grace the restaurant walls.  By our table, there were like six different recipes for catsup.  We thought, this is a cool cookbook, until further down on one page we saw a recipe calling for canned lobster.

I understand they want to warm the pizza as quickly as possible to keep customers moving, but they should really turn down the oven a bit. \\n\\nThe sicilian slice was marginally better, at least the sauce/cheese came to the edge of the slice (I had an edge slice, so there was supposed to be crust) but it was still a very measly amount of cheese/sauce.

I was expecting to eat run-of-the-mill Italian food and have a meeting. I had wrongly prejudged this restaurant because of its location. The meeting turned into a fine dining experience where we talked more about each bite of food than work. \\n\\nOur waiter was great and appropriately attentive realizing we were having a meeting. We ordered the daily specials but I can say without doubt that the thoughtful combination of flavors and the delicate touch of our meals must carry through to all of the dishes. I had the daily special appetizer, Eggplant Agrodolce (\\"agro\\" means sour, and \\"dolce\\" is sweet) with fresh mozzarella as my main course. Did I say \\"fresh\\"? Chef Tony Bettencourt has water buffalo milk shipped in once a week from Campania, Italy. This was the real-deal; the texture, firmness and flavor were perfect. The sweet and sour played out with the eggplant saut√©ed in balsamic vinegar with currants, pine nuts, capers and a hint of mint. Each bite made me pause and savor the combination of flavors. My dinner companion had the daily special of lamb and homemade pasta, and it too was amazing. The lamb was braised with white wine, just the right amount of tomatoes, fresh rosemary and carrots. It was a great twist on a Bolognese sauce. \\n\\nSince we couldn't decide on which one dessert to split, our waiter suggested that we might want to try two of them. He didn't have to twist our arms. We couldn't turn down the signature Warm Toffee Pudding. It was slightly cakey and moist, warm and sumptuous but not too sweet. I can't ever turn down panna cotta. This was the special dessert for the evening served with the right amount of blueberries, cinnamon and brown sugar. I have had many a panna cotta: from the North End of Boston to Italy and honestly this one was the best. There was a wonderful texture and a full but delicate flavor that I just couldn't figure out. I needed to know, so I pressed for more information and got the inside scoop that it is a combination of half-and-half cream and Greek yogurt that creates the magic. \\n\\nMy hat is off to Chef Bettencourt who clearly understands cheese and the nuance of crafting buffalo mozzarella and panna cotta - the best I have ever had. \\n\\nThe plating presentations were beautiful and not overdone. The d√©cor was very warm and contemporary. The ambiance was relaxed. The wine list matched the experience. \\n\\nSalem has a lot of wonderful areas to explore as well as a deep history.

YUM. \\n\\nSundays are Jazz Nights - though I've never been, I'm sure its worth checking out. \\n\\nOne of the great things about the Mission is that it's not quite a college bar, but its not quite an older set either. There's a nice mix of students, professionals, and med students from the close-by hospital district.

We attempted to go to a nearby restaurant, but the wait was half an hour and we wanted food NOW. So we took our bikes another few blocks, as Mary W. assured me she hadn't had to wait at Cuchillo before (it was also a Tuesday). Upon arrival I immediately loved the space. It's... upscale-casual, if that makes sense? I felt comfortable in my sun dress but if I wore jeans (never, they are the devil) or a cocktail dress I would have felt just as at home. They have a bunch of lucha libre wrestling posters at the entrance and a friendly host who directed us straight away to a cosy little table by the exposed brick wall.\\n\\nWe cuddled in and ordered a couple of cocktails - mine was smooth and balanced, and all too easy drinking, and Mary's was smoky and delicious! We followed those up with a Mojito, and I grabbed one the same drink she got. While we enjoyed our drinks we ordered some appies - on the server's recommendation we got the chipotle salt dusted fry bread, the white bean parmesan fundido, and the blistered padron peppers. She suggested this combo because you can make PIZZA with it. She is a smart woman. I was totally crazy about everything I ate, and wolfed down so much delicious Mexi-pizza. It was quite salty, naturally - I would suggest salting the tortilla chips a little less as the queso fundido provides enough salt on its own. However, this did mean we drank a bunch of water, so that's good!\\n\\nWe then ordered the octopus salad, and pulled pork tacos with mango papaya salsa - tell me you don't want to eat those things?? The octopus was a good combo of tender and chewy, and the potatoes and pea shoots really rounded it out. By the time the tacos arrived we were about to explode, so I need to try these again sometime! That said, I ate all of my taco and hot damn was it tender, well sauced, and tasty!

Not bad!\\n\\nI told him the most popular item on the menu is the Reggie...so he ordered that...deluxe style (with an egg on top)...which is a biscuit with chicken, bacon, cheese, gravy, and an egg. Amazing. He loved it. I ordered the Chatfield...my favorite...which is a biscuit, fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and apple butter smothering the chicken. Truly a gift from God!

Needless to say, I'm so glad I made that reservation. \\n\\nFirst off, I must mention that the Animal Kingdom Lodge itself is so beautiful. Just standing in the lobby I was in awe - who knows what the rest of the hotel looks like. I made my way to Jiko and was greeted by two friendly hostesses, one of which took me to my seat and talked about how much she loved the food here. \\n\\nMy waiter Nasser greeted me with a smile and such a positive attitude, I knew I was in for a great night. Nasser was one of the waiters on my trip that really went every inch of that extra mile to make my experience extra magical. He was so knowledgeable about the menu and was very attentive to my needs but didn't overdo it at all. \\n\\nNote: The bread basket here is definitely out of the normal bread basket flavor profile. It wasn't my favorite bread basket ever but I really love that they didn't stick to tradition and are offering a more adventurous and culturally authentic approach. \\n\\nFor my appetizer I got what was like an African Spanakopita. There were 3 on the plate and it was DELICIOUS. They were little triangles of phyllo dough filled with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and deep-fried. There was a little Apple curry slaw on the side that perfectly balanced everything together. \\n\\nListen. My entree...I don't have the words. It took a while to get it but it was worth every minute of waiting. I wasn't sure if there was an issue with my order and honestly it wasn't a big deal. I just mentioned to Nasser that it had been a little over 30 minutes that I had been waiting for my entree and I just wanted to know what happened. He sincerely apologized and brought it out with a swiftness. I wasn't even mad, I just wanted to know why it took so long. When it got to me, it didn't even matter because it was one of the best entrees I've ever had in my life. I got the Peri Peri Green Circle Chicken with Corn Wissleslag (puree), Peas, Corn, Chicken Reduction and Shishito Peppers. I can still taste it as I'm typing this. The moment I put my knife into the chicken, juice squirted onto my glasses and that's one of my favorite moments at a restaurant - knowing they can properly cook chicken. Every bite was so decadent, meaty, tender, creamy, velvety, rich, and luxurious. I would've waited another 30 minutes just FYI. \\n\\nAt this point, Nasser brought me a phone and said Goofy wanted to talk to me. It was a recording of Goofy singing Happy Birthday to me which was such a cute touch. Nasser offered to buy my dessert and he said he was gonna bring me the best dessert on the menu. \\n\\nI had about two sips left in my martini when I accidentally bumped it over and it spilled over the table. Nasser came back and saw me cleaning it and said \\"I will get you a new one right away.\\" and came back with a brand new glass, free of charge. If this man isn't a manager by next time I come back, I'm rioting. \\n\\nThe dessert was simply divine. It was called Malva Pudding. It had mini cakes that were soaked in Amaretto Liqueur with Melktart Ice Cream nestled into a Kataifi nest and a shortbread bird, all on top of a Cabernet Gel√©e. Visually pleasing to the eyes and of course to the palette. \\n\\nTo top it ALL off, with the check, Nasser brought me a Birthday Card from the Lodge which was signed by a few of the employees in the restaurant with birthday wishes. I can not praise this man and his customer service skills. It was all genuine, too. \\n\\nNasser and Jiko - thank you for a FLAWLESS dinner."},{"name":"Verde","address":"640 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"Disappointed.

I'm giving it two stars and not the four (yes four, because the food has been a solid for me) I was going to give due to my experience during lunch today.  \\n\\nFirst, you must realize that Chin Chin is not in any way, shape or form gourmet food but it is always a solid bet as far as I'm concerned.  I have never had a complaint about any of the food I've ordered from them.  However, their customer service is lacking.  Today, I ordered the spicy tuna maki for $8.50.  It did not come with anything.  No soup, nothing.  After I placed my order I remembered seeing a lunch special for five pieces of nigiri and a California roll so I was wondering about it and called my server over to inquire about the nigiri.  Admittedly I am not a sushi connoisseur so I really don't know that much about it and thought it best to ask just exactly what nigiri is, but my server had other plans.  When I asked he said it was a special where you can get either five or seven pieces plus the California roll.  Ok.  I have that part of it but what is nigiri?  \\"Fish\\" was the response.  OK.  I have that part of it, too, but what IS nigiri?  Is it a different kind of fish?  Raw fish?  Half cooked fish?  I give up at this point because I guess all I'm going to get is \\"Fish\\" for the answer which isn't completely incorrect so maybe there was something lost in translation.  *shrug*.  So I asked if I could change my original order from the spicy tuna maki to the nigiri lunch special and he said, \\"too late.\\"  Ummm ok?  I would have paid for the food I already ordered but to not inquire further was lacking on his part.  So I ate my $8.50 spicy tuna maki roll and drank my $1.50 sweet tea and left.  What a blah experience for my first day back to work after a long holiday weekend.  Blah, Chin Chin, just blah.\\n\\nAs others have pointed out, their pricing can be a bit high."},{"name":"Java Noodles","address":"2400 E Oltorf St, Ste 14","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My FAVORITE Pad Thai ever.

I am not a fan of shopping, especially when it involves being exposed to the bumper-to-bumper predictability of chain retailers. However, having just moved into a house earlier in the week, a run to Target, World Market and Best Buy were necessary stops for us to get things cleaned and settled. \\n\\nIt was around 11:30 when we left World Market with some curtains and a rod :) My wife said she was hungry and my 2 year old daughter anxiously whined for apple juice and a snack. We were disappointed to find that our prime choice, locally owned Marcella's, was not open until noon. As the whining escalated to craziness, I frantically noticed a non-descript restaurant just a few parking lots to the north. Decorated with a few green awnings and little else, I wondered, \\"Could it be Applebees? Chilis? Red Robin? Smokey Bones? TGIFridays? Red Lobster? OIive Garden? Max and Ermas?\\" I knew that it wasn't Bob Evans, because Bob Evans has red awnings. Anyway, trying to figure out what this place was didn't matter. White panic was quickly setting in and sustenance was crucial for our survival.\\n\\nAfter painstakingly freeing my tired, hungry daughter from her car seat, I turned towards the restaurant's central, green awning above it's main entrance... O'Charleys. \\"Well,\\" my inner self told me, \\"there's no turning back now.\\"\\n\\nWhat then followed was very consistent with the typical \\"not-quite-fast-food\\" chain restaurant experience:\\n\\n* We were welcomed by a rosy greeter, menus already in hand, before we had the main entrance door fully open.\\n* We passed a shiny, prefabricated bar advertising signature drinks with names like \\"Cotton Candy Cosmo\\".\\n* We were presented with a booth that was adequate, but (as is often the case) the walk prompted my inner self to wonder, \\"When a restaurant isn't busy, what makes an attendant pick a particular booth amongst a sea of otherwise empty booths?\\" The answer to this riddle involves waiter/server assignments, but in this case we passed 5 or 6 perfectly good booths before being asked, \\"Is this OK?\\" It was OK.\\n* We were overwhelmed by a menu that was more like an expansive book. I ask the following, \\"Chain restaurants like O'Charleys... what's our niche???? What are you trying to accomplish???? Do you throw pasta dishes into the mix because you don't want me to slam the menu together and flee over to Olive Garden across the street???? Is \\"Chapter 3: Seafood\\" offered because Red Lobster is a viable threat????\\"\\n* We were still in the act of sitting down when the greeter handed off the baton to our waiter who asked, \\"Can I get you something to drink? Perhaps freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade, or a Bloody Mary?\\" I wondered, \\"What. No Cotton Candy Cosmo?\\" Iced tea worked.\\n\\nWe audibly placed our orders as music blared mainstream country artists covering classic rock hits, and before long we were presented with a basket full of sweet, buttery rolls. These were actually pretty tasty and served as a nice hold over for our meals:\\n\\n* My wife got a Classic Burger with cheese and fries.\\n* My daughter got some Mini Corn Dogs, fries and whole milk.\\n* I order a 2-side Lunch Combo that consisted of a Loaded Baked Potato and a Caesar Salad.\\n\\nMy Loaded Baked Potato came with a large creamy swab of butter, creamy sour cream, creamy melted cheddar cheese, and creamy bacon bits. As I took off the creamy swab of butter and picked out my creamy bacon bits to put back on the potato (because I like bacon), the place suddenly began to fill up with old people. I found this interesting because there was nothing in the place that communicated to me that O'Charley's wants to target that demographic, but hey... everyone's gotta eat. \\n\\nWait a minute, O'Charleys.... there's you niche! Old people! \\n\\nMy daughter, normally a picky eater, seemed to enjoy her Mini Corn Dogs, and at one point noticed my discarded swab of butter slowly melting on a side plate. \\"Daddy, what's that?\\", \\"Butter.\\", \\"What color is it?\\", \\"White\\", \\"No it's not. It's black!\\" Currently, every color is \\"black\\" in my little girl's eyes, but ultimately she may have been referring to the stranded bacon bits oozing down the swab's slope. To be honest, I was relieved that she didn't ask to eat the butter or dip her last Mini Corn Dog in it.\\n\\nWe drove home tired and sweaty. There was no crankiness, no cries of hunger... just a few burps that came from the back seat. Would I eat at O'Charley's again?

No, I know it wasnt fresh.  I expect to get reasonable food for their reasonable price to say the least. But this was just an overall bad .. bad experience.

At first glance, the dark, upscale atmosphere tells me that this is a place that knows what it's doing and that I'm in for a great night. However, the feedback I've heard so far tells me that there's a bit of inconsistency night in and night out. I'm keeping my mind open and hoping for something great.\\n\\nThe outdoor seating overlooking Lake Eola was gorgeous, but was unfortunately full. I was seated inside, which was unexpectedly devoid of customers for prime dinner hours.\\n\\nThe service was great during this visit and was likely helped by the fact that I was one of maybe three tables being served in the entire restaurant at the time. Good service is good service, though.\\n\\nStarted out with some perfectly salted and steamed edamame ($5)followed by their baked brie ($10). The brie wasn't served quite as hot as I had hoped which made me eat it a little faster than I had wanted to. Didn't really get a chance to enjoy it.  \\n\\nDeciding to splurge a little bit, I ordered their 10 oz bleu cheese stuffed filet mignon as the main course ($38). I was absolutely impressed by the quality of the dish and the temperature (med-rare) served. Having said that, I still think it was a bit overpriced for a filet. \\n\\nSpice would be fun for a date night and has an amazing atmosphere for it. A little inconsistency in the kitchen holds it back. I'd like to come back sometime and get a better idea on some of their other dishes.

Again, Thank you!! I ordered some kind of frozen drink that the waiter suggested to me and the margarita pizza. I also asked about a side salad. There was a salad on the menu that could be added to a pizza order but said that it could only be ordered for a minimum of 2 people. Waiter was nice enough to check if I was able to order it even though I was on my own. I was! Thank you #3! Food was fast getting to me and I was checked on plenty of times; water refilled. The waiter (Ericco??) was fabulous and even took time to chat with me. What a great place! It was definitely higher in price. I paid $18 just for a 10\\" margarita pizza. Bill altogether was almost $50 for drink, salad and pizza. Then again, it's DW so...shrug! The servers all appeared to actually be from Italy which I felt was very important and a nice touch.

If you see this deal on living social or group on i suggest you buy it and QUICK.  We have been there before, and the place can be on the expensive side, but def well worth the $.  So, if you have an upcoming birthday or just feel like treating yourself to a good meal .. so to 62 Restaurant.  oh, my g/f got the Arugula Salad and her entree was the baked cod.

Their food is bold, spicy, rich and packed with flavor. Do I think it is oily, yes, I guess I do not mind the oil as much. some items that I love is Aachar Gosht, Chicken65,Tandoori Chicken. Some people mentioned the food it not authentic. I am not Indian, but my husband and I went there last night, the place is PACKED we are the only non-Indian people there. Seems very authentic to me. If you like Spicy food. You have to try this place."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The design of Be Our Guest is breathtaking on approach & the inside.  Be sure you specify the room you want like the main room or rose room otherwise the 3rd room is so plain.  The decor outside & in has great detail-all the stone look carving, castle, gargoyles, than inside a grand entry with a mosaic Beauty & Beast wall by the bathroom, windows with snow falling and painted celing, rose room's wilting rose, scratched pic, fireplace, than you pass a room where you can take pictures with the Beast and the library room.  All beautiful grand details.  \\n\\nNow why only 3 stars was the service was ok; better service at CA Grill & Tuskers.  I think it just depends who you get as a waiter.  Food was ok.  Reminded me a lot of Chefs de France's menu.  But service was better there.  French onion soup was the same,  seasonal trio salad ok, garden salad better, & mussels were good.  The best entree for us was the steak  fillet.  Salmon and lamb were ok.  Desserts were ok.  The best was The Grey Stuff. \\n\\nReservations were tough as the best advanced reservation I  could get was 8:20 PM and I got online 180 days in advance to make the reservation. Host/Hostesses are hot & cold as you get one who acts like she hates her job than you get another guy who is just so lively so this can effect the beginning.  This happened because we requested the grand ball room instead of the west wing.  West wing just had no character compared to other rooms.  The request extended our wait 20 mins.  To wait for Rose Room would have been even longer.  The Hostess who didn't like her job kinda scolded us for wanting a different room but my husband who checked us in didn't know and we didn't know that west wing was so plain compared the main room & rose room even the library was decorated better and no one is eating in there.  Going through what we did for the reservation and what you're paying, we wanted a better experience as the west wing you feel excluded from everything.  \\n\\nFor example, the Beast has to switch out.  You'll hear the grand entrance and really can only hear in the west wing and not see.  He 1st enters out from the Rose Room than into the grand ball room.  He'll visit in the west wing but again you miss the \\"show\\".  \\n\\nThe Rose Room did look more intimate and the grand ball room you can just observe to your heart's content.  \\n\\nMaybe this place is still on its learning curve as some of the staff was energetic as others weren't.  After we'd had so many wonderful servers and experiences dining, we just expected better from this spot because it was just so all that.  You can see all the excitement of the visitors coming that its a shame service isn't consistent as you get a gloomy staff person and it just effects the experience; but get an energetic staffperson and the experience  is like Christmas morning.  \\n\\nWe were on the deluxe dining plan so it took 1 credit, not 2 like CRT or CA Grill, but again this place is so heralded you expected an experience like CRT.  CRT was better on their game.    \\n\\nI'm glad we tried it because we had an advanced reservation but if you had to wait a really long time with this lucky of the draw situation, you may be disappointed.  I'd try it but just make sure you get someone great so you can have that Disney Experience."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I've been trying to find decent Indian food in the Atlanta area for nearly a year.

A few minutes later, my name was called and I was carting two trays filled with stryofoam plates and bowls over to our table.

Their cream cakes are so airy and packed with flavor, and the cream melts in your mouth like a fluffy cloud.

My favorites are the green tea chiffon and strawberry cream cakes, but all of them are outstanding.  \\n\\nI often buy birthday treats for my friends here and they are always a hit. Paris Baguette will wrap your cake in a cute blue box for no extra charge. They sell whole cakes for $20-30 and they are stunning. My friend bought me the Cappuccino cake for my birthday, and I finished it all in one sitting. The coffee sponge cake and coffee buttercream were so addicting, and it was adorned with delicate pieces of dark chocolate and a couple of pirouette cookies which added depth and texture.\\nBesides the cakes, the cronuts are a must-try, as well as the huge macarons. I've had the bubble tea as well which unfortunately was a disappointment.

There's also a Five Guys in the same building and Starbucks is across Peachtree St.\\n\\nI've eaten at this location a handful of times, mostly when meeting friends or occasionally doing business in the area. It's also a handy place to get a quick meal when coming to Dick Blick for art supplies. I've also eaten at the Sandy Springs location and both are very consistent with good service, considering that this is a \\"fast casual\\" restaurant. If you're new to that term, it usually means order-at-the-counter, better quality foods, nicer interior and higher prices. It translates into a place where you can gauge how long you'll be there by the line at the counter vs what you order (the latter factors into how long it takes you to eat). Service is generally better because you aren't relying on someone messing up your order at the table - instead the person at the counter can mess it up for you - kidding aside, you pay for the convenience of not having someone wait on you, which speeds things up considerably. When you pay for your order you get a stand for an oval number - make sure you grab it or there could be considerable confusion in the delivery of your order.\\n\\nThe interior of this location is very loft-like and industrial with modernist accents - I didn't think to take photos of the insides or exterior. Lighting is great and you can do some people watching through the windows if your so inclined - not much to see other than a bunch of cars and people coming in-and-out of Starbucks.

Upon entry I was very excited. The place is lovely and rustic meats industrial like Jojo Gaines has waived a wand over the place. \\n\\nWe were quickly seated and not so quickly started an evening of waiting. The waitress was painfully slow almost 10 minutes to take our drink order in an almost empty restaurant. We ordered appetizers with our drinks and 10 minutes later water arrived but no beer or alcohol or appetizers. 10 more minutes we have all of our drinks and a water spilled on the table, accidentally of course. 5 minutes later and finally appetizers, well one. Waitress argued with my sister in law that she didn't order smoked wings. In fact the waitress had made a point to tell her ordering celery and carrots and blue cheese would be a dollar more. \\n\\nSo we start on the first appetizer...disco brisket fries. Very good, ended up being the best dish of the night. Not enough ranch drizzle as promised but very good. The brisket with fries, a perfect vehicle to deliver each bite. \\n\\nSmoked wings arrive next and no blue cheese. They are dropped on the table with no comments or questions, grrr. They were small but good. Celery was very rubbery and old. \\n\\nPulled pork sandwich arrived. Impressive bun, white, thick, slightly grilled and lovely. Large pickle chips standard and not crunchy. Pulled pork very dark, almost greasy and wet. Salty, salt lick salty. Fries were ok. \\n\\nBathrooms are huge and plenty of stalls. Very clean. \\n\\nOverall great atmosphere just not great service or food.

The milky white broth is flavorful enough that you don't actually need any dipping sauce, but if you want sauce be sure to ask for the sesame paste sauce (I don't think it's on the menu but it's the kind of sauce they have at real Mongolian hot pot restaurants in China and it's fantastic -- made from black sesame paste, fermented tofu and some other stuff).  As if that's not enough reason to go, the service is also terrific.  Our waiter was Eric who we had met a year earlier at a noodle place in Brighton.

Nevertheless, it gave us a chance to grab a drink.  I had the pomegranite mojito and my husband had the mango mojito, both very tasty and well made. \\n\\nOnce seated we were greeted by a friendly server who was a little caught up in his \\"spiel\\" as he offered drink recommendations and then noticed we already had drinks.  He then caught himself and turned his attention to the menu where he gave a few recommendations.  Now here is the reason why this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars from me; we were there for restaurant week but they did not put a restaurant week menu on the table.  This was not an oversight, they purposely did not offer the menu, you had to know about it and ask for it.  In my opinion that is shady and it makes the customer feel like they're are being cheap or something (believe me, it's still not cheap!! And our bill was more with the restaurant week menu than if we ordered straight off the menu).  That being said, once we did get the restaurant week menu we were very happy with our food (and service).  Per recommendation of the server we tried the crab cake (not on RW menu) which was nice and moist and tasty.  It had a terrific sauce that made me want to lick the plate.  I had the chart house salad (a little close to a taco salad with no shell).

My main gripes were the dry meat and that they give so little rice with your food.  A small cup with a cute little heart shaped and marinated piece of carrot on top.

One of my friends got there early and placed his name in for a table. The hostess told him it would be about a 15 minute wait. We were encouraged to wait at the bar and that they would call us. About 20 minutes later, we weren't called and there were multiple tables that had opened up so we went to the hostess and asked how much longer it would be. She said she had a table ready and sat us. \\n\\nThe waiter took our drink order quickly and brought them 10-15 minutes later. The drinks were decent but overpriced. We placed our order which consisted of shrimp cocktail, the hummus trio, lobster bisque, and a 16 oz prime rib. The food came out nearly 35 minutes later which was quite a long wait but we had good conversation keeping us occupied. So well over an hour after walking in to the establishment, we were eating.\\n\\nThe prime rib was ordered medium well but 50% of it looked rare. It didn't really matter because we were so hungry that we didn't want the chef to cook the steak any longer. The hummus trio was ok but nothing very exciting. Unfortunately, the shrimp cocktail I had tasted strange. It was very heavy tasting and the texture was like rubber. I thought maybe it was me because I was at Chart House and the seafood here should be very fresh. After eating half of the shrimp in 30 minutes, I started feeling queasy. I quickly excused myself in to the bathroom as my body did not want that shrimp. One of my friends had mentioned her brother-in-law went had lobster from Chart House less than a year ago and got very ill from it so she wanted to speak to the manager about it to make them aware that this is the second time she knew of people getting sick in their restaurant in a year. The manager said that she had sold over 20 orders of shrimp cocktail during dinner and that this is the first she is hearing of anyone getting sick today. She went to the kitchen and spoke to the chef then came out and spoke to me asking if I had any allergies to shellfish. I don't. I explain the strangely heavy taste and the odd texture of the shrimp and that I have eaten many shrimp cocktail in the past but this tasted different. The manager said that if it were truly the shrimp that I would have gotten sick 5-7 hours later. I know that's not always true and I understand that they are defending their food but I felt as if they became more defensive versus apologetic. I would have loved to hear \\"I'm sorry you got sick. I'll check with the kitchen staff to see if there is anything out of the ordinary or if we are using any new vendors.\\" Unfortunately, I got a it's not us, it's you answer. \\n\\nAt the end of the night, they took the shrimp off the bill which I thought was nice of them and an appropriate thing to do.

You know the kind: looks nice enough from the outside, always has a decent crowd, menu seems interesting enough. But when you actually pay a visit, the execution on the promise falls flat. Such is my assessment of The Depot - a train-station-turned-restaurant on Memorial Drive. My friend Kali and I stopped there one weekend afternoon after we'd worked up an appetite window-shopping in nearby East Atlanta Village.\\n\\nAfter arriving and being seated, we waited an inordinate amount of time for almost everything - drinks, silverware, appetizer. Even before I'd had a single bite of food from the kitchen, I already had a sour taste in my mouth from this place. When our appetizer - the fried green tomatoes - arrived, it looked pretty good. Coated in a crispy batter and topped with a slice of gouda(?) and some smoky peach salsa, it had all the makings of a tasty intro to a more substantial meal. After sampling it, all I could say was that it was an intro - a deep-fried augur of things to come. Pretty on the plate yes, but the only flavor came from the salsa.\\n\\nNext to arrive were our entrees - we both opted for burgers. Mine was the turkey burger which came with grilled onions, and an olive tapenade along with a hefty serving of hand-cut fries. Much like the appetizer, I struggled to find any distinctive or memorable flavor in either the burger (even after adding all the tapenade to the sandwich) or the fries. To underscore the point, I - a notorious french-fry fiend - even left most of them on the plate, untouched.\\n\\nTo round out our less-than-stellar experience, we opted to sit outside on the patio since it was a sunny day. Let's just say, the scenery on this (or any) stretch of Memorial Drive isn't exactly the best, and we were treated to: a homeless guy walking by, wrist-deep in a bag of Funyuns; a guy and girl who looked like they were conducting a low-budget photo shoot on the steps of the loft building across the street; and the post-war, rubble-y look of the in-construction building next door to the Depot itself. Nice.\\n\\nAfter trying it firsthand, the best thing this restaurant has to offer me is the occasional juvenile chuckle that I get when I drive past, and some of the lights in the sign have gone out, making it read: 'The Pot'.\\n\\nHey, don't act like you don't think that's funny too.\\n\\nwww.bonvivantonline.com"},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"EAT HERE\\n\\nThis place is most excellent.

Also, the time I came in with the party, there was some kind of issue with the register that kept orders from showing up and caused much delay while money processing. Hope this has been fixed since then.\\n\\nGames: A wide, wide selection! Love it! A little overwhelming though. Perhaps a typed up guide binder on the side on the little shelf would help, with at least a list of games for each genre. \\n\\nDecor: Beautiful! Chandeliers, paneled booths, a lovely looking bar... very nice. Could use more space; it's very difficult to squish by... though that's a sign of a packed location. \\n\\nNoise: It would be nice if they expanded the store one day; it gets very noisy during game play, and it's hard to hear the other end of your table while other table is shouting obscenities about murder and mayhem. Still trying to figure out the best way to maximize socializing in a big group here. Also, it becomes a more prominent problem when one table is playing one of the more inappropriate games and the other table is full of mothers and children. \\n\\nFood: Good, but nothing special. Would be nice to see some flashy, drool-worthy pictures somewhere in the restaurant, just because sometimes one gets so hungry that seeing something easy to order seals the deal. Tried the pulled pork pizza: pork could use a little more flavour. (Perhaps red wine? Barbacue...? something exotic..? Maybe that's too much to ask... ) Love the crust though.\\nCould really use more beer selections. Not even Granville Isle beer.\\nLimonata is good. The house iced tea is also delicious, with one free refill.\\n\\nConclusion: Average food, great game selection, amenable staff, rowdy atmosphere, lovely location."},{"name":"Habibi Restaurant","address":"1012 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Found this place on yelp and it lived up to my every expectation!

Travel, international food, funky spaces and inventive dining experiences are all in my wheelhouse. This place exceeded my expectations and the whole experience blew me away. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I visited for some cocktails and small bites on date night. First of all, the service was spot on the whole night. Jonathan our waiter offered to validate our parking right away (bonus points). He explained the concept, described dishes and gave excellent recommendations. He was attentive while allowing us the privacy to enjoy our meal. The other staff were also excellent. The decor is beautiful, unique, and classy with no detail overlooked. Amazing artwork and artifacts. They have an Andy Warhol! The bathrooms are worth checking out for the decor alone. I look forward to returning to sit in a cushy booth with friends as it would likely feel like a completely different experience. \\n\\nWe love well crafted cocktails and everything we tried hit the mark. Go for El Navegador, the Spanish inspired Gin and Tonic. It was so good and the most beautiful cocktail I've ever had. I felt very fancy drinking it. I also like that they support other local businesses by using 1821 bitters. \\n\\nNow, usually I'm pretty anti-tapas. Often times they are a way to charge more money for less food under the guise of \\"tapas style\\" which is what I was expecting with this place. The drinks and decor would have made up for it even if that were the case, but the food was amazing! We shared 3 dishes, the Havana egg roll, curry coxinhas and burger. They were pretty sizeable portions, just enough to taste but also to feel satisfied with each experience. We enjoyed the fusion concepts but each dish stood well on its own and was memorable by itself.

It's exactly what they're known for, what they advertise, and what you should order.  My group and I thought that the sausage pizza was excellent.  We even took some of it home, and it tasted pretty darned good reheated.  Plus, the portion size for a pizza that feeds 2-3 people was pretty generous.\\n\\nHowever, the non-pizza entrees were ghastly.  We got the pasta with meatballs and chicken parm about four minutes after we ordered - major red flag.  The pasta and meatballs were not very flavorful at all - they were very much a \\"side\\" rather than something that would be worthy of serving as the centerpiece of a meal.  And the chicken parm was pretty poor for $26.  Limp, bland, and without much spice, it tasted like it was either re-heated or sat under a heat lamp for a while.\\n\\nDrinks and service were fine.  They do have a pretty nice wine selection - to be expected for a restaurant in Epcot's Italy.

He probably was more surprised, but my french ended there.  \\n\\nI decided on ordering that fancy ham and swiss entree and the soup dujour (Cream of Tomato and fennel).  It was served at the perfect temperature and it tasted far better than any place else that claims to make it from scratch.  Perfect amount of sourness, and saltiness.  The best part was when I got to the bottom of the soup bowl.  It was so creamy that there were little sand bars of tomato cream.  Rather than scooping it all up I felt compelled to leave it at that as if I created a piece of art at the bottom of my white bowl.\\n\\nThe main course came out and it was like looking at a french post card with a sunny side egg on top.  I cut into it and the cheese was perfectly melted so that it stretched from the plate to my chin on the way into my mouth.  It was so rich in taste I felt a bit overwhelmed.  I truly enjoyed the whole meal.  Total cost was about $15 which I felt was fair for just the experience alone, but the food was great so it was a bonus.  Definitely not a daily lunch affair, but when you feel like there's a need for a change and willing to try something different feel free to visit that little french cafe Chez Nous."},{"name":"Java Noodles","address":"2400 E Oltorf St, Ste 14","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We get delivery from Java Noodles 3-4 times/month and have never been disappointed.

From the moment we stepped in the door, the waitstaff were warm and welcoming, and checked on us throughout our meal.  The food descriptions on the daily chalkboard sounded interesting so we mainly ordered from that.  We ordered two appetizers and two main courses.  Our waiter advised us to order an extra vegetable dish and, when we received our order, we then understood why.  Many restaurants are going to this model where there are no accompaniments.  Therefore, the $30 halibut dish was a sole piece of fish (5, possibly 6 oz.?) on a small plate, as was the scallop dish where there were 4 (possible 5?) scallops on a plate.  The Brussel sprouts that we ordered were around $12 - $13 for an order that would satisfy 2 people as a side dish.

The butter knife was insufficient to saw through the meat. They powered through it though, until someone, finally, came around toward the end of the meal to ask us how our food was. After explaining the meat was very tough, a manager was fetched and it was discovered the meat was improperly trimmed and prepared. The silverskin was not removed and the lamb was overcooked. The manager offered to replace the meals with another selection, but by then my parents were pretty far into their meal and declined. They were pretty dissapointed with their experience.\\n\\nWe had the Grey Stuff for desert. It was delicious!  ;)  A light, cookies-and-cream mousse/whipped panna cotta piped on top of a chocolate cookie/biscuit."},{"name":"Chez Nous","address":"510 Neches St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hubby & I chose Chez Nous to celebrate our 24th Anniversary.

It is what it is so do not expect high quality, genuine Italian food.  Before the meal, I did like the rolls but felt the salad was non descript although the dressing was very good.  I hesitated to get the chicken parm when the server told me is was made with chicken tenders.  I did so and found the dish very tasty and to my satisfaction not deeply fried and greasy.  The pasta was just okay, did not have a home made taste and was luke warm. My server was friendly and did check in to see how I was enjoying the meal."},{"name":"Handi Cuisine of India","address":"1579 Bellevue Avenue","city":"West Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Excellent.

I use to go almost every week but, unfortunately because of my work hours I haven't been in months. Everything is flavorful and plentiful. The prices are also very reasonable. What I like the most about them is that everything is made from scratch and fresh. It is definitely a great alternative to chain restaurants. \\nThe location is a dive in an awful neighborhood but, don't let that turn you off because it is safe during their business hours and I never had any issues. It is clean and the staff is personable and attentive. I feel sorry for them because they have a lot of low income customers who complain a lot and try to get something for nothing. This is the type of restaurant that you just happen to stubble upon and don't expect anything from. However, after eating here you will go out of your way in the future to eat here."},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Just WOW.

(This antipasti combo might be better for a group of at least 4 if you want to leave room for any of the great looking and wonderful smelling food that we saw the surrounding diners enjoying.)
