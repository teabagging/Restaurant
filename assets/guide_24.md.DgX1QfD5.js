I had yet to come here for brunch, and let me tell you, I won't be coming again for brunch, and frankly I don't know if I want to come again for anything else either. This bums me out because this is  where my boyfriend and I first met, so of course I have a soft spot for this place. I've been here several times over the years, and not too long ago in fact for snacks and drinks. The service has never been outstanding, but not terrible, same goes for their food. It's Ok. I come here because often it's convenient for myself and whomever I'm meeting, and they have a patio.\\n\\nAnyway, for brunch I order my usual basic breakfast when I haven't been to that restaurant for breakfast before  (2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast, side of Hollandaise). Generally, it's pretty hard to screw that up, other than the Hollandaise, which is why I get it on the side and don't order a Benny so that said potentially bad sauce is not all over my food. Don't recall what my boyfriend and our friend had  but the general consensus was it was passable, but not great.\\n\\nSo, I get my breakfast and EVERYTHING was either room temperature or just flat out cold. Toast, room temperature as were the eggs. Hash browns, cold, the bacon was COLD. WTF? I actually put against my boyfriend's hand and said \\"Is it just me or is that bacon actually cold?!\\" Sure enough, it wasn't just me. And yes, you guessed it the Hollandaise was COLD. Not look warm, but actually COLD. \\n\\nThe waitress comes back dancing a little jig in place to the shitty music they had playing (Bare Naked Ladies, REALLY?!) and asking how our food was. I said \\"not good actually\\". She looked puzzled and asked why not. I told her why, and she said she'd go talk to the kitchen about it. Now, here's the doozie of a response - she tells me that the Hollandaise is cold, and that the eggs warm it up., and did I want something else instead?  Sorry but WTF?! I told her that no, that is not true, the eggs are not supposed to warm up the sauce, (and by the way, how could they when they  too were only  luke warn?), and no I did not want anything else. I ate a half piece of toast, and a bite of the hash browns, and the eggs, but it was really not good, so I barely touched it.\\n\\nBill time comes and our server says she took 10% off everyone's food. Really? Why? They ate theirs, I did NOT eat mine because it was not good, and she knew that. I was really shocked. I should have refused to pay, but we didn't have time for a fuss as our friend needed to get going,  Yes, I could have ordered something else, but hey, I probably would have been charged for that too, and why eat more mediocre food? They couldn't even get standard bacon and eggs right. The reason I ordered that is because that's what I wanted. If I had wanted something else, I would have ordered it the first time round. \\n\\nUsually when a customer lets you know their food is not good for whatever reason, it gets taken off the bill, particularly when they have barely touched it because it isn't good. Not here..they knock off 10%. Gee thanks. Enjoy that money I gave you for the sub-standard food, 'cause it's probably the last of my money you will get. My suggestion to the Whip is to step it up several notches. There's a lot of competition out there."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"In Portland for business and wanted to check out the donuts.

Salmon chips are fantastic and i don't even like salmon. Definitely expensive but this is cool."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The Union Oyster House is not the best seafood restaurant in the world, but it is the oldest restaurant in the US and that's worth something. It does its job solidly. Make no mistake, this is old school New England seafood. It's probably a little heavier than many modern tastes prefer but that's what they do here. You can always go to Legal and get a piece of grilled sea bass if you can't handle butter, breading, grease, and fairly rich takes on seafood. Even so, the fried foods are nowhere near as greasy and heavy as Southern-fried seafood. You're in a tourist district so be touristy--get a lobstah. By far, the best experience is sitting at the oyster bar. It oozes atmosphere and dusty charm and they usually have a decent selection of oysters which, as long as you keep them fresh (they do) are pretty difficult to screw up. Second best place to sit is in the room just above the oyster bar. It is old, dark and cozy. Not the most comfortable but charming nonetheless. Avoid the big room upstairs if you can. It's okay but the charm factor drops way off in there. Try the chowder. It's thick and with a hit of pepper and/or Tabasco, it hits the spot. Everyone in New England has a different take on what makes good chowder so you have to take almost anyone's review on that in perspective. Some like it almost like broth; others, thick as mud. This is on the thick side which I like just fine. As for the entree, you can avoid the issue of rich and breading if you go with the lobster, better broiled than boiled. Again, tough to screw up and it avoids the whole rich, breaded issue. Sides are middle-of-the-road but not bad. Every now and then the cole slaw even comes out excellent. Be aware that if you order a clambake you better be hungry. Yes, it's overpriced and, yes, the service is usually straightforward and can, at times, be a little slow. But I've ever had it be downright poor here. In short, stay to the right--downstairs or upstairs--order the basics, sip a beer, bask in the history of the country's oldest restaurant and you'll have a nice little taste of Olde New England. And then you can say you've been."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went here because I was told by my native friends that it was a necessary part of visiting Atlanta and I'm inclined to believe them.\\n\\nWhile nothing here exactly blew my mind, everything was delicious and (as far as I know) quintessentially southern.  Free potlikker led to fried green tomatoes (oh, remember when I said nothing blew my mind?  I was lying.  These did.), led to fried chicken with biscuits, collard greens and macaroni & cheese.  The chicken was really very good, but it came with too much to eat in one sitting and I probably could have gone with the smaller order.  The macaroni & cheese was not my favorite kind.  It had something like mayonnaise in it or something and it wasn't a very uniform consistency.  It kind of leeched grease and sat in a pool of it after being on my plate a little while.  I left most of it there.

The baked cheese polenta and potato gnocchi were both solid and definitely recommended.

She ordered the Danish Pancakes (of course) with lingonberry jam and their housemade lemon curd. Dad ordered the Smoked Trout Pytt I Panna, and I ordered the Baked Scramble with applewood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, and gouda.  We had to wait for a good 20 minutes before our food arrived, but I guess it was ok because I was mesmerized watching the sole chef pull together multiple orders manning the grill making potato pancakes, filling mini cast iron skillets with diced goodies and eggs, and plating food in colorful  dishware.  I took my sip of my sister's Spanska.  It was a bit too strong for my empty stomach, but my sis thoroughly enjoyed it. I stuck with the mocha, which was acceptable.  The Danish pancakes were cute and resembled mini muffins and tasted like light fluffy larger versions of eggettes.  I preferred the lemon curd over the lingonberry jam.  I snuck some to smother my mini slices of walnut toast .  I loved the potato pancake.  The baked scramble was tasty as well, but became a tad rich for my taste buds after eating half of it.   The diced potatoes in the Pytt I Panna was a bit too char for my father's taste, but the smoked trout was excellent.  The slivers of pickled beets on it was also very tasty and served as a nice complement to the baked eggs and smoked trout.

We have been excited to try the pizza...heard great things, but we didn't get to eat. We showed up at 6:15 or 6:30 on a Friday, so obviously quite early/before the big dinner rush. We showed up dressed casually, which is not important to me, but is important for this review. I feel that we were treated poorly because we were not all dressed up. We sat at the bar to order a drink while we waited for our table to be ready. My mom and I ordered a bottle of bubbly and my husband got a big beer. We really should have just eaten at the bar in retrospect, but we wanted a table so we could share a few things. We ran into some friends and chatted with them at the bar, then the owner/host came over to show us to our table. It was in the middle of the street between the restaurant and Hannibals. First of all, it had been a hot day, but was now super windy and chilly so we were freezing and my mom wasn't pleased we were sitting in the street to begin with. I am still unclear as to why we were sat here in the first place as there were open tables inside. Anyway, my mom is in town from Sarasota (she also worked all day and then drove two hours to see us) and we were trying to take her out for a nice dinner and show her around Winter Park. We ordered some pumpkin ball appetizer thing. By the time that came out the whole evening at this restaurant was ruined. The wind picked up and our menus flew all around, knocking both full glasses of champagne over (and all over my husband's pants). I went to ask if we could move to a table inside, thinking of course we would be accommodated due to the circumstances, and we were told we could move to a table four feet to the right...no longer in the street, but still not inside or even under the overhang, essentially on the curb. What's the difference? The host scoffed at our request as if we had asked the impossible. Look...I get it's Friday night, but under the circumstances wouldn't you think something could be done? He had the worst arrogant attitude and acted like there was no way to do anything better than another table right next to the street. Literally, using the word correctly, the street. Normally, a host at a restaurant is kind and accommodating, but he could not have been farther from it.\\nI told him that simply did not work for us and we'll take the check, certainly assuming that since two entire glasses of champagne spilled all over my husband that they would not charge us for the (four pumpkin balls for $8.95) and they did!! They actually brought us a bill for $8.95 after all of this (we paid for the drinks at the bar). It was a joke. I honestly found this particularly insulting. The two glasses of champagne my husband was wearing totaled more than the half eaten appetizer. We expressed this to our (super nice, funny, dedicated, knowledgeable) server and he completely understood. He missed the scene with the host/owner and wasn't aware how unhappy we were until we told him. The thing is, we live in Winter Park and we are major foodies. We frequent Luma and Prato and we thought this could be a new regular place for us. I wouldn't go back if you paid me. I wore leggings and a little dress and Toms shoes, so I wasn't exactly dressed up, but we weren't going to Victoria and Albert's. I felt like we were treated so poorly because we weren't dressed up and we didn't have a reservation (it was 6:30, and we were more than happy to wait at the bar with a drink for a table, we are not unreasonable people). My husband is a corporate chef for a major company and he could have brought a lot of business dinners here, but we will be telling anyone who will listen to dine elsewhere. The host/owner is an inept and abrasive unprofessional, the likes of which I have never seen dining all over New York City at Le Bernardin, Marea, wd-50, Blue Hill, Jean Georges, etc. I'm used to being treated with respect and was treated so poorly; I was beyond pissed. We left the restaurant so frustrated and still quite hungry. In all my years as a foodie (my whole life) and all my years in Winter Park (ten) I have never been so upset with a restaurant experience. The host/owner is so arrogant and acted as if he was heading the front of house at the finest of restaurants, except I have eaten at the finest of restaurants and have always been treated with respect and like an absolute lady. He needs a crash course in tact, kindness, and humility. We also saw him barking at the servers and treating them poorly. I can't wait to never eat here and to let everyone know to spend your money elsewhere. Too bad too...we were excited to try the pizza.

Also during this happiest of happy hours, the large board of cheeses goes from $14 down to $9. Served with various fresh breads and fruit slices, the board makes filling finger food for two or more people, especially over wine or a beer.\\n\\nDinner wins, too. Evenings, Dahlia often has live music--I've seen jazz & Spanish guitar players perform here. The music is not deafening either, just enhances the rustic and romantic French ambience. On nice nights, ask for a seat on the lovely back patio, which is neither cramped nor smelly like some others in town.\\n\\nVegetarians: the vegetarian lasagna (best I've ever had, hands down) and the mushroom crepe are the best dishes on the menu.

It was no later than 5pm. We walked to the entrance of Palmers from the theatre lobby. I have been to Palmers in the past, but only for brunch, which was excellent. We stood for about 5 minutes before one of the concession workers came from about 100 feet away to tell us that the hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant. On my prior visits, I have always been seated from the theatre entrance as the parking is in back. Perhaps some signage for those entering at the movie theatre would be helpful. \\n\\nThe restaurant was packed at the bar, but had more than 10 tables empty. We went to the hostess who rather snobbishly asked if we had a reservation. Since we attended the movie as a last minute thing, we did not. We were told, \\"Sorry, we're all booked.\\". Ok, we said and proceeded to walk to the exit. The hostess followed us (for no reason) and said that if we wanted we could sit at the tables next to the bar. These tables are so small that we could barely fit our cocktails, let alone 3 full dinners. A hostess who portrays herself to be of exemplary quality should certainly know better. We politely declined and left.\\n\\nThe issue at this restaurant and with that pretentious haughty hostess is that these people consider Palmers to be a truly FINE dining establishment. They are nice, but by no means a fine dining restaurant. They are attached to a movie theatre and their website boasts about their paint night and chicken wing specials. Palmers is not in the league of the Oak Room in Boston and other like restaurants, although they believe they are on par.\\n\\nMy advice to moviegoers, if you are going out for a movie and want a nice dinner afterwards, skip Palmers and walk around the block to 5 Corners Kitchen.

With 3000+ reviews, I might as well be pissing into the wind (to borrow a rather unsanitary analogy). Voodoo IS the quintessential Portland experience: if you're visiting, you HAVE to come here. Word is, they're drafting that requirement into law. (OK, not really. But they should). Know a few things first, though:\\n\\n1. These aren't the best doughnuts in town. They are the most original, without a doubt. But for better tasting ones, head to Tonalli's on Alberta. Their buttermilk bar is a slice of heaven. \\n\\n2. Prepare to wait in line. Possibly for a long time. There will always be people ahead of you, whether it's 10 AM on a Saturday or 11 PM on a Tuesday. This is inevitable. I've waited for as little as ten minutes and for as long as an hour...but I've always waited. \\n\\n3. The doughnuts are pricey (and cash only). You're paying for the experience (which is likely to include a revolving menagerie of colorful characters, many of them sketchy but harmless). The KEEP PORTLAND WEIRD mural directly across the street is apparently revered as gospel by many around here. \\n\\nThe doughnuts are good, don't get me wrong. The Bacon Maple Bar lives up to its hype, and the Voodoo Doll - complete with raspberry \\"blood\\" and a pretzel stake through the heart - is chewy, tasty, and photo-worthy. I'm partial to the Maple Blazer Blunt and the Orangatang. The Portland Cream is decent but hardly extraordinary, and the one time I tried the Captain My Captain, the Cap'n Crunch cereal on top was stale and lifeless. \\n\\nHere's where this review could have gone bad: we got married last week, and wanted a quirky/casual vibe to our wedding, so we placed a special order with Voodoo for an assortment of customized doughnuts in lieu of a cake, including blue and orange for our favorite football team (go, Broncos!) and red, heart-shaped ones. On our way to the Oregon coast, we waited in line for nearly 30 minutes before arriving at the counter...only to find they had no record of our order. In a near panic, with my wife-to-be close to tears, the manager turned the situation around by customizing a bunch of doughnuts on the spot for us, and then only charging us for 2 Voodoo Dolls ($3) even though we left with over a dozen doughnuts total. Hey, mistakes happen, and their willingness to make things right, realizing how special an occasion this was for us, meant a lot.

This is in fact right across from the CDC on Clifton Rd.  \\n\\n1641 Clifton Rd NE will get you to the right spot.\\n\\n\\nLets clear this up early, I like to separate burgers similar to pizza...  there are a few different \\"styles\\", you wouldn't try to compare a great Chicago deep dish to a NY thin crust to a brick oven Neapolitan.  Likewise, you wouldn't compare a burger like this to say...  a big 2/3lb from Ted's Montana grill or Fuddruckers.  \\n\\n\\nIn this case, there should be plenty of familiarity with the style you find at burgerfi.  Five guys, yeah! burger, ground house, just the ones I know of in Atlanta anyway.  Multiple patty burgers, no need to specify medium rare or medium well.  \\n\\n If you've eaten at any of these places, you're not going to get any surprises, which is good.  \\n\\nCompletely avoiding the whole thick vs thin patty preference, I'm only going to rate this with similar competition. \\n\\nThe burger was excellent.  I went with the triple, because you're always most hungry when ordering.  I got the cheese, the bacon, went all out for my first time.   I included a picture, the cheese was everywhere, simple yellow American (though swiss and blue were options).  Tasted like *real* American, not kraft slices.  bacon was perfect, bun was great, ended up melted into the burger by the end, just the way I like it.  veggie toppings were all fresh and crisp.  Im told the beef is all free range organic ect, with everything going on, Id be lying if I said I could taste a difference, but I guess its nice to know anyway, serve me the same burger with grocery store beef, and Im betting Im still happy.\\n\\nfries, clearly fresh, right amount of salt.  I might have liked them slightly more cooked, but it was really close... there is a \\"well done\\" option that I might opt for next time, but I didn't have a baseline for that yet.  \\n\\nOnion rings, 3 huge rings, check the photo.  clearly freshly battered and fried.  \\n\\nShake, This is my only beef, the shake was excellent, required a spoon is all I can say,  but for the price, I thought it was a little small...  no leftovers in a metal canister.  \\n\\nIll get to price now, burger was very reasonable, I think a double cheese was like 6.50.  cant argue with that at all.  the fries and rings were another 5, and I cant remember about the shake.  Maybe 4ish.  its a lot of food for 15 bucks... but something about the cost ratio...  When the \\"sides\\" end up as more than the \\"main course\\", I start to get antsy, like something has lost focus.  Your mileage may vary.  \\n\\nI don't like to rate too much on price, because we all value money differently, and you don't need me to tell you what a good burger and fries is worth. (even though I just did :p )\\n\\n\\nThere were small fry options for 2 or $3, not sure how small they were, didn't see them.   This is no 5 guys extra scoop in the bag.\\n\\nOne things for sure, if you have restraint and go in just for the burger, its a great deal.\\n\\nrestaurant was very nice, staff was very friendly.  tip, the menu indicates that the preplanned burgers come with 2 free toppings, of which ketchup is on the list.

We started out with the sweet potato fries, which was presented in a neat stack like jenga. It came with a honey dipping sauce which complimented it very nice since the fries itself was a bit on the harder side like it was not cooked all the way so it didn't bring out the full sweetness. I went with the spicy creamy vegan ramen adding an egg and bamboo shoot. I will say that I was not disappointed at all and left a very happy customer. The soup itself wasn't very spicy but it was very flavorful. The noodles that came with the ramen was thick and cooked to perfection. It was soft but also still had a bite to it.

Other \\"german\\" restaurants frequently only have what is clearly mass-produced Mott's or something similar.  This was considerably better.\\n\\nIn our number, we had two celiac gluten free eaters (myself and my dad.  You see, we're related...)  They were very helpful and many dishes were gluten free or could be easily made so (although the frites are done in the same oil as the wienerschnitzel, so be aware - also the knackwurst is poached in beer.  In both cases, I know this because our server alerted me to it). I ordered the schwienshaxen, which normally comes with spatzel - I got potato pancakes as a substitute.  My father ordered the jagerschnizel with german potato salad instead.  \\n\\nThe biggest downside is the volume - some we mentioned to our server who said that they're working on it, but it'd require a minor remodel of the dining space.

I ordered a Tropical Splash cocktail with an Espresso Creme Brulee, just hitting the minimum. Their selection of drinks--wines from all decades, exotic cocktails, fancy bottles you've probably never heard of--is, by far, one of the most impressive ones I've seen; the drink menu spans through a book of numerous pages.Needles to say, there's a lot of hard liquor on the menu and with their minimum charge policy, it is easily a place you won't walk a straight line out of.\\n\\nThe Tropical Splash was very, very strong. There was a huge presence of the Bacardi, and the drink was good, but too much for me to handle. The creme brulee was also great and surprisingly, medium-sized.

Why are Burnt Fork's so good? First the pork! Burnt Fork uses Eden Farms Pork, the best humane raised pork out there (all of which are better than nonhumane raised pork). Second, and here's the rub, it's the rub. Secret recipe, but stellar. Last, slow smoking. Add to this the four great housemade sauses (Memphis, KC, N Carolina's vinegar sauce, and S Carolina's mustard-based sauce) and one has great ribs. The pulled pork and brisket are great too, but I am a rib fan and any time I can eat quarter rack of ribs and feel satisfied, but not loaded down with fat, I'm happy. I must mention the white bread that comes with the rib sandwich. You know it, white, thin, and tasteless. Not here. Burnt fork bakes its own breads and their white bread might make me start eating WB again.  It is good and a real complement to the ribs.\\nI have only had 5 sides: baked beans, kale, Collards, and Mac and cheese. Of these the kale and the Mac and cheese are worth the trip. The others are good, but these two are outstanding.  The Mac and cheese uses two cheeses including gruyere. Don't get this if Velveeta is your ideal for Mac and cheese, but if you like some taste and a bit of complexity, this is it. The kale, well it changed my idea of what kale can be, an intriguing texture and wonderful flavor. By far the best vegetable side.  Can't say the same for the Collards,which though they jade nice mouthiness were too sweet, as if they should be sweet at all. The beans were ok, but not up to the standard of the others. Kudos for enough chunks of Bacon, but little snap and no memorable taste.\\nLast is the BBQ tofu. Now I am a limited fan of tofu and couldn't imagine it a vegetarian alternative to REAL BBQ, but it is. I actually limed this and of was a unique taste.\\nThis place clearly reflects the owner's dreams and they have succeeded in making those dreams come true. The Burnt Fork deserves a much bigger following than it has yet garnered. \\n\\nSo how do I know all this?

We both got the grilled chorizo omelette with the Cajun home friends. How can an omelette with chorizo and guac be bad?

The Cajun home fries were too thickly cut causing a starchy consistency when they were deep fried. They also weren't seasoned adding insult to injury.

My 4 1/2 yr-old loved it  as we involuntarily yelped with excitement as pizza dough as huge as flying saucers was thrown in the air only a feet away from us, even the salad maker showed pizazz as he made 2 salads at a time, simultaneously swirling & flipping each in a metal bowl!  It was quite a show and an impressive display of team work.  As for the food, the Roquefort and pear salad, was large and possibly one of the best I've ever had.  Perfect amount of dressing, generous amounts of cheese, nuts and pear.  Easily large enough for 2 to share.  After all the fun, it didn't really matter if we got pizza or not.

There is nothing too imaginative here. Non-descript tables and chairs and nothing that catches the eye for wall decoration. \\n\\nService: I think my waitress talked to me on two occasions during my entire visit and had no idea about anything when it came to wine. She came over to introduce herself about 10 minutes after I was seated and took my order and I didn't even see her until my food came. Once she delivered my food, she came back for the check and that was about it. Not impressed with that...  \\n\\nFood: The wine selection is not extensive and what they have, from my experience, is not of high quality. The food however, is excellent. The pizzas are larger than most and the ingredients taste fresh. \\n\\nOverall, Pasquale's is a good little \\"almost hole in the wall\\" restaurant with pretty good food.

The few times I swung by the restaurant during my stay this week there were few guests, which is a little worrisome on one hand but very welcome on the other hand if one is in a hurry.\\n\\nI decided to get an early lunch at Cafe Matisse on a Friday. I was seated promptly and presented with a menu I believe I had seen before upon my hotel arrival a couple nights previously--the room service menu. Needing gluten-free fare to avoid general abdominal cramping, I had hoped the spinach salad would be safe, as it came with grilled chicken, strawberries, and a strawberry vinaigrette. I was disappointed to find the strawberry vinaigrette to be more like a strawberry syrup, and the chicken was grilled, but also seasoned with some sort of glutenous herb mix. The taste took me (way) back in time to childhood when my mother prepared chicken with Shake n' Bake.  Do they still make Shake n' Bake? I digress....\\n\\nAnyhow, after an unhappy stomach earlier in the week, I was sure to ask the server about gluten-free options. She didn't know, so she consulted with the chef. The chef came out to my table, and when he said one of the salads would work, I jumped on the option. He told me he would freshly grill the chicken without seasoning, which made me super happy. The salad arrived at my table - mixed lettuce, huge chunks of apple, chicken cooked perfectly, and a gluten-free balsamic on the side, all packaged into a very generous portion. I don't like hijacking the kitchen staff to answer questions, but it was worth it to avoid a gut bomb.\\n\\nIf you're in a hurry and aren't as picky or high-maintenance as I am, I think Cafe Matisse is a fine option.

It is part of the vast McMenamins empire, and probably the jewel of the chain besides the Edgefield Brewery. With multiple bars (Detention, Honors, Cypress), a soaking pool, restaurant and a movie theater all contained within the corridors of a former elementary school, it is unlike anything else you will find. All the bars are lively without being so loud you can't hear yourself talk over the din, which is exactly what I look for in a bar.\\n\\nPrices for alcohol are affordable, with a decent selection of frou-frou cocktails at about $7-8 a drink. There was a large selection of coffee-based tipples that piqued my interest, but ultimately we settled on a pitcher of the Ruby raspberry ale for about $12-13 (prices varied between the bar and restaurant, strangely enough). Food was a little more, but my friends and I didn't have anything to eat besides a hummus platter as McMenamins food is notoriously variable in quality. Service as at any other McMenamins establishment was slow, but friendly.\\n\\nAll in all, I wish we had taken the time to sit and watch a movie as well (at $3 a ticket, why not?), but it was enough to grab a couple drinks and wander the hallways.

When i say vast, I mean vast...  Super overwhelmed and confused as what to pick. Everything looks so darn good... \\n\\nI ended up picking two, I opted for a classic glazed donut and a Cap'n Crunch donut... Really Really Good Stuff. I'm no donut expert, but it was by far the best glazed donut i've ever had. It was soft, sweet... almost a donut/cake like texture.  My attempt at a description will do the donut a disservice. It was just GOOD, go get your hands sticky and grab one if you really want to know. The Cap'n Crunch donut was reflective of the glazed but with Cap'n crunch and Crunch Berries stuck to the top. Again, also really really good stuff... Straight sugar overload. \\n\\nThe place is partly tourist attraction and local hotspot. You can't miss the paisley pink building with the long line of customers outside. You'll see tourist in the parking lot taking selfies with the building in the background and locals walking out with pink boxes of their favorite donuts. \\n\\nIf you're from outta town you definitely have to stop here, and if you're from Portland and haven't been here... well then, you probably don't like donuts. \\nVoodoo Doughnuts.

My face is not unknown, but they don't know if I have a regular order or not. I can tell you this is one of the last remaining authentically Austin coffee houses or establishments in town. It seems we are being taken over by yuppies, bit not here at Bouldin. no way, no sir. This is hippie corner. You can even occasionally run into Leslie Cochran here. The selections of beers, coffees, lemonades and teas are superb. They are an all vegetarian, all natural food establishment - and very affordable. I typically order the reliable tacos. I love The Basic (egg and cheese), The Neal (Sauteed mushrooms, spinach, egg & cheese), and The Goyo (Organic red and black beans, cheese, tomatoes and sprouts). They are absolutely delicious and at $1.75 to $2.50 each you can't go wrong nor can you empty the bank account. The Slackers Banquet (organic red and black beans with house seasonings over organic brown rice with the option for toppings of cheese, peppers, tomato and onion) is also incredibly good. My favorite drinks here are the Lavender mate Sour (Mate tea and lemonade with a splash of lavender) and the Raspberry Sour (Raspberry hibiscus tea and lemonade). They are so very refreshing and tasty. I can't drink coffee, but I have several friends that will tell you the coffee is worth the visit.\\nNow, the biggest downside of Bouldin is two-fold. 1) there is only one ordering counter and there is only one person taking orders so the line gets rather lengthy because of its popularity. 2) during the summer this is a rather hot place to be as most of it is outside and the inside is not well air conditioned. I would stay away during the hot Summer months. I have almost come to a point with Bouldin that I want to boycott it for the time it takes to actually order a single drink.

The ceviche was delicious. It was cold and refreshing with just enough heat to appreciate the temperature. My only complaint was that the prawns were cooked. Not what I expected from ceviche.\\n\\nThe dinner menu produced similar results, very good food with some hints of being a touch off. The entrees included a few seafood options but with halibut and other meats that don't seem natural with south american food. Perhaps that is the point. I had the scallops. They were delicious. The plate was a little over done with a green apple reduction and another sauce. Probably didn't need both. In fact, I would ditch the green apple and stick with the other.

This place is expensive; don't try to pretend it's not going to be.  I think that not paying attention to those things (dress, cost, reservations, even weather) in advance may negatively affect your experience from the get-go.  \\n\\nMy last visit was yesterday. There were three of us, kicking off a friend's bachelorette festivities. We were about 15 minutes late for our reservation, but they seated us with no problem. We even got a corner table with a spectacular view on a sunny Saturday afternoon.  Our waiter was attentive and experienced. There were no issues regarding things like bread (which is excellent), refilling water glasses, or timing of service. Our cocktails were great; I had a lemon ginger martini, which was perfectly balanced and exceptionally pretty. My friends had a dirty martini and a lemon drop martini, which they also liked. The waiter and busboy were very clear about whose cocktail shaker was whose and fussed over us to make sure that we wouldn't accidentally pour the wrong remaining drink into the wrong glass. Again, very attentive. \\n\\nFor lunch, our order consisted of a pear salad, a spinach salad with shrimp, and a turkey club. The turkey club was actually kind of spectacular, especially for such a traditional sandwich. It was on buttered/toasted multigrain bread and there was a small bit of cranberry within the layers of turkey, tomato, lettuce and bacon. I wouldn't allow myself to finish it, because we were going out to dinner later but I will say, I very was disappointed to have to leave any of it behind!

The garlic naan was amazing and would be the one reason I would go back (or honestly not to sit and eat, but just grab an order of naan and run). I also ordered the mixed naan, meh, would not order this one again. Dipping sauces for naan were great too. The waitress kept pushing us to order appetizers for our wait (so we eventually broke down and asked for the naan to come out first and a couple of friends order soup and chapati as pre eats). Well, we got half the naan. Had to flag down waiters to bring the rest. Had to flag down another waiter eventually when my friends soup didn't show. And again had to flag down yet another waiter to get the chapati. So, they really try to push you to order an appetizer I guess because the food can take a bit, but you ultimately have to keep track and keep asking them for what you ordered. I had the chicken tikka masala, it was good, not great, but good. After 45 mins into the meal, I finally got the limes I had ordered with my water when I first sat down.

This is my fourth time here. The first time was really good. Ordered the chicken and waffles, gumbo and catfish as our meals.  Drinks were also good. Service was great at the table. However, the service at the bar was subpar. We were told the drink menu at the table was not the same as the drink menu at the bar. Therefore, whatever drink I requested that was served to me at my table, I couldn't get at the bar. Side note: the place only has one bar so who made the drink the first time???  An invisible bar or a secret bar in the back?? I don't know and I'm being very sarcastic. Second time, service was good. Ordered the buffalo oysters, catfish and lobster Thermidor. Food was really good. Third time, the service was the absolute worst. Ordered from the lunch menu during this visit, which is limited. I asked to add shrimp to my pasta dish and a side of collard greens. My partner asked for chicken and waffles with a regular waffle. He agreed to our order. The pasta dish came out with no shrimp. The collard greens were never brought to the table. And the waiter brought out the sweet potato waffle instead of the regular one. When asked about why the order was messed up, he said that he forgot to write down the shrimp to add to my pasta. He didn't think I was \\"serious\\" about wanting the greens. And he didn't know which waffle he gave us. Fourth time, we tried dinner again since that seemed to work out better the first couple of times. This time was even worse. Service was decent at best. However, the lemonade and pink lemonade were watered down. When inquiring about why the drinks don't taste right, the waitress blamed the morning shift. I switched my drink to water. This time I ordered the buffalo oysters, catfish and grits and the chicken and waffles. The buffalo oysters were soggy. The food came out looking pretty edible. However, the catfish and chicken was bland. While finishing up the waffle, my partner thought she saw a bug crawling on her food but couldn't find it. As I was dipping a piece of her waffle in the syrup, she noticed the bug crawling on her chicken bones. We alerted the waitress. The waitress apologized and told the general manager.  I guess he approved the waitress to take off that one meal. She gave us the bill and let us know that the manager was not going to come over to our table to address the issue. So, I adamantly requested that the manager come over to speak to us. I saw him walking past near the bar and called him over.  He came over and apologized. But, then said that the restaurant had been exceptionally busy today and that's why the service and food had problems. I looked around the restaurant and there were about 50 people total. He said that they had a total of 650 people walk through the doors that day. I find that hard to believe when the restaurant was maybe 30% occupied while we were there. Overall, I recommend saving your money and go to a restaurant with better service, better food, and management who actually care.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will not be returning.

The fries are different than I remember. No Parmesan or actual truffle to be found despite the fact I ordered and payed for such. I distinctly remember crispy fries inspired by Brussels and coated heavily with shaved Parmesan and truffle oil. Nada. Then, the burger was so overdone it was like leather. Grass fed beef needs to be handled with care and cooked medium rare at the most. Rare is even better. Perhaps the health department has gotten to them. If that's the case, I am saddened.

We each picked two items from the 2nd course menu -deviled eggs, cured beef, melt-in-your-mouth cheese tart and meatballs that I can't get my mind off of. I felt like I was eating gold. The main course was just as tasty and unique - venison and duck - each with an interesting twist on a lingonberry accompaniment. The food was so good we called the chef out of the open kitchen to say thanks so much - did I mention we had several Nordic beers? The meal closed with a lovely cream and lignonberry dessert served with gingersnap cookies - a new and delicious flavor combination for me and a oil chocolate cake that was dense and earthy without being heavy or overly sweet.  Our waiter provided us with a shot of some type of liqueur to settle our stomachs.  The presentation was fun and reminiscent of sushi - with well paced dishes arriving on small white platters set on wooden boards.  The service was fun and professional.

When I say small, I mean really small, which ads its own charm. They specialize in fish dishes and homemade pasta. I got the lobster ravioli, which turned out to be pretty good. It was only $13, but it was more pasta, less lobster, so it was priced about right. We also got an order of Calamari... which was honestly disappointing. \\n\\nThe prices were reasonable for a nice place (10-20$ for an entre, which does not come with any sides), but just high enough for me not to give them five stars. Otherwise, quick, attentive service and great food (minus the calamari).\\n\\nOne thing to know, if you're going here to sit down and eat, the dining room has a separate entrance just down the street from the main entrance (just follow the signs).

The crust was about 16 inches in diameter, and the very sparse toppings were about 10 inches in diameter!

The manager who I now know as Ashe came over to serve me. He knows what I order and I did not even have to tell him how I liked it cooked. I complimented him on his service. He then came back to me after placing the order and said that he wanted to explain a few things to me about the previous occasion. He fully accepted that I had nothing to do with the \\"incident\\" in question but said that he was annoyed with some of our other friends who came in and stood at our table while we were finishing our drinks. He further explained that his license does not allow standing at the bar having a drink which they did, as we were all getting taxi's on leaving the premises. I fully accepted his explanation and informed him that we were not aware of this regulation as in our country it is the norm to stand at the bar and have a drink. Incidentally on the night in question we had been sitting at a table. Ashe accepted my explanation and then put his hand across the counter and I shook hands with him. Because of his honesty and forthright explanation /apology I sat and had a few glasses of wine and we had several conversations during the evening. \\nThe next evening, Saturday I again went for dinner with two work colleagues. On sitting at my usual place we were approached by a black haired little vixen, in short denims, best described as not knowing whether she was walking towards you or walking away depending on which way here toes were pointing. She immediately addressed us as \\"good evening guys, I hope you are going to be on your best behavior this evening\\". I was somewhat taken aback by this unfriendly welcome but decided to ignore her rudeness. We had a nice meal and then paid the bill at the end. As soon as she had taken our money she asked in a really sarcastic voice which one of us had posted the \\"shitty\\" review on yelp. My two friends were astounded by her rudeness and aggression and were speechless. I asked her why she was asking and she replied that it had to be one of us and then looking at me she said \\"and because of the way you asked I now know it was you\\"\\". My two friends got up and left in disgust but I gave her the courtesy of listening while she was talking or should I say \\"ranting\\". She then said that we were no longer welcome in the premises and \\"don't come back\\". She said that there had been nothing but \\" incidents\\" every night that we had been in and made further completely scurrilous allegations which I will not post here. She was in such an aggressive and downright unmannerly state that I knew it was pointless engaging in a conversation with this little \\"madam\\" so I got up to go. As I did she spat out \\"oh I knew ye were bother when ye came in and drank milk with your meal but boy, when ye got alcohol yous showed yourselves. I then left the premises. I can honestly say that her behavior made me realize that Ash was a real gentleman in comparison. I'm at a loss to understand what the aggression in this premises is about other than it being anti Irish or something. I will miss a lot of nice things about Vancouver when I leave, but I can assure anyone that the whip won't be one. \\nIncidentally i was employed by the Justice Department in Ireland for 30 years and experienced behavior similar to this little madam many times in some of the rougher areas of Ireland and had to show them the \\"error\\" of their ways. It's a pity I'm retired. \\nGood bye Vancouver.

As I was writing down my order Margaret (think thats who is was) the ex owner came up to me and gave me a back rub! I was little scared at first because i wasnt sure if this was something normal or if she was just a crazy old lady! We exchanged a few words and she was off to the next table.

This soup was really good and i could have had a big bowl of this. HAHA. \\nI ordered Country Fried Steak with mac and cheese and Green beans. I think my waitress forgot about me because my food took a while to come out of the kitchen and i could tell it was sitting for a few minutes because it wasnt SUPER hot and the gravy was starting to get a skin on it (you know what im talking about!). I was ok with that and was excited to eat. The country fried steak had good flavor to it and the gravy was the make or break and that gravy was BOMB. I should have order and glass on the side and just drank it. HAHA. Green beans were a good side and they werent covered it butter which i thought was going to happen. NOW the mac and cheese on the other hand was something i was really looking forward too... BUT NOOOO it was not what i thought it was going to be at all. I take my first bit of them and they were just so bland and flavorless. At first i was thinking it was just that first bit but... it wasnt. I had a few more bites and that was it for me i couldnt eat it anymore =(. This was a big disappointment for me because i am a HUGE mac and cheese lover.

Also, for whatever reason I just find Buckhead generally annoying compared to Midtown or Decatur.\\n\\nThe staff dress code appears to be faux-Williamsburg. Lots of beards, plaid, etc. Everyone we dealt with was knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu, and gracious. Overall, the decor is interesting and engaging, and the acoustics allow one to carry a conversation without strain in a full restaurant.\\n\\nThe complimentary \\"bread\\" course was a Yorkshire pudding with cheddar, offered with (superfluous) butter. I don't have much basis for comparison, but it was tasty.\\n\\nWe ordered three starters. The octopus salad starter was tender but otherwise just OK. Other Atlanta restaurants - notably 4th and Swift, Serpas, and the Optimist - have K+D handily beat here. (This dish hooked us on 4th & Swift.) The candied lamb belly was pretty good, but fairly expensive for what looked and tasted like three open-faced doener-kepab sliders. The bone marrow was very good, with a fun presentation, too. It was my favorite of the three starters.\\n\\nAs for the entrees, the scallops are very pricey for just three scallops, but they were well prepared. The rabbit, by contrast, was both delicious and copiously portioned. It's basically a sampler with four different preparations, with some pearl couscous. If you order starters, expect to take much of it home. Fortunately, it doesn't lose much when you reheat it the next day.\\n\\nOne thing of note: we ordered the baked mousse dessert, and it came in a thin, relatively tall glass that had a chunk fall out while we were sharing it. Close inspection after the break revealed a web of cracks in the glass, but it would've been very hard to spot unless one very carefully scrutinized the glass. I didn't penalize them for the mishap in my rating, because both the server and the manager handled the issue promptly, professionally, and gracefully. However, if someone from K+D is reading these reviews I'd recommend using a wider dish for this dessert, and perhaps smaller (espresso-sized) spoons, as one exerts pressure on the glass in the normal course of eating the dessert.\\n\\nHowever, I did ding them a star for the parking situation. It turns out if you want to park your own car in the building's deck, they don't validate, but there's no clear sign on the deck that they don't validate.

I have lived in Portland for 7 years and I *always* looked forward to eating here.  Even hosted my 40th birthday party at Andina for 15 people a few years back.  Yet over the last 3 visits (this past year), the experience has never been above a 2 star.  \\n\\nThe last visit was on a Thursday, July 21st to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We had reservations for 8:30p.  Ordered two Sacsayhuaman and one was really sour (in comparison).  When we asked, the server said he wasn't sure why the difference.  He offered to comp the drink, but left it on the bill.  \\n\\nTruly enjoyed the Cebiche de Pescado.  So fresh with the citrus juice!\\nThe Conchas Parrilla, Anticucho de Pulpo and Chicharron Prawns were also delicious!\\n\\nAsked for the Empanadas without the powdered sugar, but they forgot and delivered them as such.  I find the sugar is too much with the slightly oily dough and I suggest it w/o the sugar\\n\\nDessert was delivered but took a good 15 minutes.  they also forgot to bring the port I ordered at the same time.  the delay is acceptable if the restaurant is busy, but in this case they were cleaning up which leads me to the heart of the two stars.\\n\\nWe ordered almost everything on the server's first visit to the table since it was late and we know the menu.

The place was mostly empty and we were greated by a very competent and friendly hostess (a startling contrast to our previous visit) and seated immediately. The wait staff was also very pleasant and competent.\\n\\nMy wife and I commented to each other about what a positive change this was compared to our prior experience there. Then I joked to her that since we are the first people to be seated for dinner that we'd be getting the leftovers from the prior shift.\\n\\nI shouldn't have joked.\\n\\nThe brisket, beef ribs, and memphis ribs were so dried out as to be almost inedible. It was as if they had been left in a warming oven since the previous shift! We felt as if we'd been served leftovers.\\n\\nThe beans were an interesting combination of 3 different colors as if three different batches of different ages had been mixed together.\\n\\nAs noted elsewhere the fried pickles are ok but the corn meal batter does not adhere to them. They'd be better off with a flour based batter.\\n\\nThe coleslaw was ok although it was a mayonnaise based recipe. I'd prefer it with a vinegar dressing and with more celery seed.\\n\\nThe fries, both regular and sweet potato, were fine but nothing exceptional.\\n\\nSummary: The entrees were bad. The sides were iffy.\\n\\n\\n\\n============\\nFirst Visit\\n\\nFrankly, I can't actually comment on Midtown Smokehouse's food because we were never served. In fact, we were never seated. Nor was our name put on the waiting list.\\n\\nThe hostess (who may also have been the manager, it was hard to tell) was so busy doing everything except for seating customers that we saw at least 7 people walking out the door before my wife and I decided that the 30 minutes spent standing at the welcome station was a total waste of time and we left.\\n\\nDuring the time we were waiting for the hostess to actually acknowledge that there were customers there were always at least 2 or 3 empty tables that she didn't fill.\\n\\nShe didn't even bother to give menus to one of the few parties that she did seat. They eventually came back to the front and got menus themselves.\\n\\nThe phone was constantly ringing and was either left unanswered or the callers were turned away because she was too busy to write down their takeout orders.\\n\\nInstead of having a list of parties waiting to be seated there was a pad of paper with names all over it with no apparent rhyme or reason.\\n\\nWhen the hostess eventually asked me for my name she got so distracted by crossing out things all over the pad that she never actually wrote my name down.\\n\\nThen she'd disappear and be waiting tables, talking with the kitchen crew, handing out leftover boxes, filling cups with sauce, and all manner of things instead of actually being a hostess and bringing in customers.\\n\\nI can't imagine how much business they lost that night because of one person's apparent lack of experience. She didn't delegate tasks to her wait staff. She didn't spend more than 20 seconds at a time at the welcome desk. Instead of taking names and telling people, \\"I'm sorry, it looks like it'll be a 45 minute wait,\\" she just ignored the people at the door.\\n\\nMost of the discussion amongst the people in line had to do with where they were going to go to actually get served.\\n\\nMy wife and I headed down the street to Acapulco's where we were welcomed at the door, we were given a page, we were seated within 5 minutes, and the staff was professional, welcoming, and courteous. Oh, the food was great, too.\\n\\nWe'll try the Smokehouse again, I just hope they find a hostess/manager with some actual restaurant experience."},{"name":"Seaport Elite Private Yachts","address":"200 Seaport Blvd, Commonwealth Pier","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Friend: So my company is having our office party on a yacht this summer.\\nMe: That's soooo cool.\\nFriend: Yah I know.

The burger smelled just like one from Wendy's and the size of the burger wasn't much larger than one either!

I've only heard about it in passing.  My family is visiting so I've been taking them to some food spots to go home bragging about. After leaving Ross on Caroline yesterday I decided to Yelp nearby restaurants. Five was so close with overall great reviews so I decided to \\"bite\\". Plus, I'd always wanted to try it. When ordering,  the young lady was kind enough to let us know that two fries would feed the four of us, saving me a couple bucks. The fries were good and the burgers were great. Suddenly, my mom gets a strange look on her face while chewing her delicious burger. She begins pulling out a long black hair like one of those clowns at a kids birthday party. The whole table was like \\"Ewww!\\" We began to laugh as we are a goofy bunch. The staff appeared to be expecting our return to the counter as we were an earshot from the counter and another young lady sassily approached and pat her hand on the counter like she was ready for us. Mom showed her the hair, along with the chewed burger it was in (gross). The lady stated that they wear hair nets and just looked at Mom. I then said we do not have black hair since she wasn't offering any solution and she replied that she didn't say we did.  Alrighty. So she was then offered a new burger which is fine because they were good. I began to wrap mine for later. I just had to let the picure in my head subside. We were brought the replacement burger by a  nice lady  and she  apologized. I would have given 4 stars even after the hair if they would have offered a solution at the onset of the complaint given  with evidence. Or if the person was as welcoming as the order taker and the lady who brought the replacement. We could see the cooks wear hair nets, but we clearly didn't have jet black course hair. We shouldn't have had to defend that point before a solution was offered.  2 of the 3 peolple we made contact with were gracious. I will return in the future.

The best of the three was the margherita, but none of them were especially outstanding. The crust of the pizza is thin and very tasty, cooked perfectly every time.

It's nothing revolutionary, just a well done pizza.\\n\\nNote: Make reservations or you may have to wait for hours (on a weekend). The reason I went to More Home Slice is because there was a 2 hour wait for Home Slice. \\"More Home Slice\\" makes the exact same pizzas with a more limited menu and follow a strict \\"A pizza every 20 minutes\\" schedule. \\n***You can order full pizza or just slices of pizzas. \\n*** Home Slice does not deliver. \\n***Prices are good for how big of a demand there is ($10-$18 depending on size and type) \\n\\nConclusion: If you are in SOCO, there are plenty of places to eat.

I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen without kikurage and the bean sprouts. Lo and behold, I received my order with everything I asked them not to put in. The ramen was decent, but the broth got thicker and thicker as I ate. Perhaps they didn't rinse the ramen noodles of the starch as well as they should have. Their crispy chicken pieces was gigantic. Like, they should learn to cut them into more manageable pieces. Also, the chicken was incredibly salty. I was dying of thirst on the way home and felt like SpongeBob when he went to go visit Sandy without his helmet. We also ordered the Hiyashi Chuka with the sesame sauce and it was just off. Their salad dressing is pretty weird too. Definitely not something I would advise anyone to get. I do like their beer selection although none of their beer is available on draft. \\n\\nAlthough chicken chashu should be replaced with thinly sliced chicken breast. Their pork chashu is pretty good but I just wanted to point that out. The ramen portions are pretty small for how much they are charging. \\n\\nIf you are looking for authentic Japanese ramen, this is not the place. This place is more Americanized. Also, there were about 4-5 servers working and yet, service was still lacking. The manager was pretty much doing everything by himself.

Just looking at the menu had me drooling over the possibilities and everything we ordered lived up to our expectations. Not one complaint at the table.  For appetizers, we all ordered something different so we could each get a taste of everything. With six people at the table we got a good bit of coverage on the appetizer menu: coconut shrimp,  beef satay, dumplings, crab cake, ceviche and the appetizer special for the night, the meatballs. Every single thing was well seasoned, balanced and tasty. I think the meatballs were my favorite. The portion sizes were just right for an appetizer. Enough us to feel like we got a taste, but not overly full. We had a bit less variety with dinner. Two people ordered the fried chicken, two of us ordered the crispy beef, one ordered the shrimp and scallop stir fry and I think the other ordered either the grouper or red snapper + an extra side of the macaroni and cheese. Again, everyone was happy. Smiling faces and clean plates all around from a group who tends towards picky. We desperately would have loved to have dessert, but we all were full to the top so we'll be back for that amazing sounding apple dessert. \\n\\nIf you're a cocktail person, the poor calvin fusion is amazing. Dangerously tasty. I could have easily had many of them without meaning to. \\n\\nSome things to know: the area near the restaurant is a wee bit sketchy, make sure you're in their lot and/or using their valet,especially at night. You do not want to wander the area aimlessly after dinner. Also, the restaurant is small. Make reservations when you can, or expect some time spent waiting (So worth it!).

I have always had a great experience there in the past, so I thought it would be a great place to have a pre-Christmas dinner with my boyfriend's senior citizen mother.  Unfortunately, this did not occur.  When entering the restaurant we were asked by the very nice hostess if we had a reservation. We let her know that we did not have one.  She was kind enough to tell us know that the bar was first come first serve and that if a table would come available before the bar she would let us know.  The hostess also told us that a couple of people were leaving the bar soon and the wait should not be that long. When a couple did leave the bar my boyfriend's mother and I sat in the seats after the area was cleared.  After placing our items on the seats and sitting down, we were approached by a gentleman. The guy told us that those were his seats.... We let him know that we were told that the seats were first come first serve and there were not any people waiting by the seats.  At that time, the \\"manager\\" James came by and told us we couldn't sit there because he had promised those seats to another group.  I asked how could seats be promised to someone in an area that was first come first serve.  He then stated that the people that those seats belonged to were there supposedly there before us (which they were not) and we needed to get up.  When I attempted to say something else to understand his reasoning, he proceeded to say you aren't going to cut me off, I'm kicking you out.  I was completely dumbfounded and disgusted by the complete disrespect and lack of customer service. The nice bartender tried to give us water and James told him in a nasty condescending voice, don't you serve them I'm kicking them out.  Not once did I raise my voice, use profanity, or act unprofessional.  We were kicked out of a restaurant because we were the first people to sit in seats that were first come first serve... James was completely unreasonable, rude, and obviously has no sense of customer service or respect for this establishment.  We were both returning customers and were treated like trash for absolutely no reason.  You could tell that the employees were even embarrassed and annoyed with his antics.  As someone that has worked in the customer service industry for years, I have never seen such poor management and people skills.  I also have never in my entire life been kicked out of an establishment.  I will not be returning to Poor Calvin's and will tell people about the experience that I have had at this restaurant.  Managers like James are the reason why businesses go down hill very fast.... And by the looks of some of the reviews that I am seeing on yelp today, he seems to be creating a poor experience for several other patrons.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nTo confirm what occurred during my visit at Poor Calvins, at no time did anyone ever tell us that there was a wait for the bar. We were told that it was first come first serve by the hostess.  James was the only person who said we couldn't sit at the bar because he had promised them to someone...  The manager James wrote in a comment that this was the case, but unfortunately that information is not true. It doesn't surprise me that this man would make up a lie to make himself look better.  It again goes to show that he has a complete lack of managerial and leadership skills. He has no right to make up a lie on one of his employees...

I just checked out yesterday. This is an excellent, intriguing place. I would give it 5 stars easily except for one huge bait-and-switch. When my girlfriend and I (first-timers) viewed the web site, we saw the emphasis on hotel rooms that were converted from classrooms, and we believed we were booking one of those rooms. But when we arrived we discovered that we had a room in the \\"English Wing\\" a recently constructed, separate building that wasn't part of the original school at all. The rooms in the English wing are well-built, but with a rather cramped layout - the king bed leaves little room for other furnishings. No TV, no coffee-maker (you put on some clothes and walk to the end of the hallway for the communal coffee pot), few available wall plugs. It's just a generic hotel building, albeit with a higher level of construction and decor than most Comfort Inns.\\n\\nWe were staying two nights, and tried the next morning to switch to one of the original school rooms, but were told they were all booked. We got a momentary look at one that had been vacated and cleaned, and it had TONS more atmosphere and space than the room we were in. I feel very, very disappointed. I wanted a unique experience and I got a generic experience. \\n\\nIf you're smart enough or insistent enough to get one of the original rooms, you'll greatly enjoy staying there and being able to roam through the various bars, or the entire school, with drink in hand, and plop into a couch or an armchair in the movie theater.

Throughout dinner multiple waiters and hosts checked on me to see how my meal was  - I'm not sure if it was because I was dining alone or because I had ordered a whole table of food, but needless to say everyone was incredibly attentive, kind, and helpful. I finished my meal with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and a cup of the salted caramel ice cream and thoroughly enjoyed sitting back and watching while the restaurant filled up and the kitchen got busier.

Have I ever eaten there before tonight? No. What's Italian for \\"big mistake\\"?\\n\\nAfter making my rounds at the bars the night before, and nursing what I'm hoping are the last vestiges of a broken heart, my mom said she would help cheer me up and treat me to a meal of Italian comfort food. What's supremely odd is that I'd been only mentioning wanting to go to sushi restaurants lately, and never even hinted at craving Italian in months. I asked her how she knew that's exactly what I wanted without me saying a word. \\"A mother knows\\", she replied. How Italian of her. \\n\\nWe chose Reale's because it was close and as of late, I only want to support local, family-owned businesses if at all possible. Reale's fit the bill to a \\"T\\". \\n\\nWalking in, we were greeted by who I believed may have been one of the actual Reales. To my left was a small bar, to my right, the dining room, and judging by the decor, I suspected Caroline Manzo from the Real Housewives of New Jersey to jump out at any time and start threatening us if we \\"messed with her family\\". This is actually a compliment, if I can envision those Jersey types sitting around a restaurant in Northwest Austin, TX. \\n\\nOur waiter, Corey, was friendly and welcoming and was a wonderful waiter from start to finish. He sat us down in the booth I was eying, which was nice. The ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a family-owned Italian restaurant: some wine bottles in casks, lights, and faux foliage circling the walls; low, comfortable lighting; the quiet murmur of conversation from other tables. The space was also very clean, and filled up fast. On a Thursday night, each and every table was full for the entire time we were there. \\n\\nThe meat lasagna had my name written all over it, since as I've said before, Mom stopped aggressively cooking years ago, and her delicious lasagna was one of the casualties. I briefly thought about the veal because I could get a side of fettuccine alfredo, but Corey said he could talk to the chef about getting me a half-order of some on the side (I acknowledged lasagna wouldn't usually come with one, but I really wanted to taste it). \\n\\nOriginally I ordered a Caesar salad, but changed my mind and thought I'd begin with the caprese mozzarella and tomato salad instead, since the photo on the menu looked delicious and I wanted to compare it to the versions I order in chain restaurants. The caprese was a surprise dark horse appetizer that I won't soon forget. Artfully presented, ample slices of both tomato and fresh mozzarella were drizzled generously in a light balsamic. Compared to that pitiful excuse for caprese at that awful Macaroni Grill or other chains, you realize some of the benefits of dining at a mom and pop. It was easily the best caprese I've had to date.\\n\\nThe lasagna didn't disappoint, either; it was obviously homemade, hearty, and heaped with plenty of meat and ricotta cheese. It hit the spot like no other meal could have at that point. The fettuccine alfredo was rich without being over-sauced. \\n\\nMidway between dinner, a man set up shop outside the kitchen and started playing \\"That's Amore\\" on what I thought may have been a ukulele. I thought it was cute. And it fit the ambiance perfectly. \\n\\nI noticed some other people's orders as they emerged from the kitchen, and the pizza looked amazingly good. Actually, a friend of mine commented on my Yelp check in and said Reale's had \\"the best pizza in the galaxy\\". I'd have to try it sometime. I'd also love to try one of the several veal dishes offered, especially the veal picatta (Veal cutlet saut√©ed in lemon, garlic, butter and white wine with mushrooms and capers). That dish was running a close second to the lasagna.             \\n\\nAll in all, I left 1.) Full; and 2.) Wondering why I had not been in sooner. It was the perfect casual, Italian-American dinner spot. Even as a local, family owned business, I'd put it up against any big Italian chain out there and I bet it'd win; I like to think of it as sort of a David and Goliath thing, except instead of a stone, Reale's could take down the giant Philistine like The Olive Garden with their caprese salad and lasagna alone. \\n\\n5 Stars, for my new Italian food standard bearer."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"334 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Burger was really good, build your own option is always nice.

We all know that in this kind of restaurants the work that they have to do is offer for each customers if they want to try any single piece of meat that they have for and like I said, in our case, he did in out table just two times.

Even though we are on the younger side, and look even younger than our age we were treated with great respect and i felt like a millionaire dining here.  My waiter was dressed almost as nice as me (hard to accomplish).  He seemed like a classy butler out of some movie or tv show.  The service was slow, on purpose, as it was meant to be a nice long romantic dinner.  Make sure you have a conversation when you dine here, cause you will be sitting for a very long time, especially between each course you order!

After parking in the Prudential Public Parking garage, we went up two escalators and followed the signs into a Lobby where a greeter was stationed. We were then politely directed to the elevators and made our way up to the 52nd floor, this elevator ride will make your ears pop.

They informed me they got my message and that a table was ready for us. I noted that a window seat would be preferred and they kindly told us it would be a few minutes which my date and I were pleased with. We popped a squat at the bar for a Jack & Coke and Jameson & Ginger, both were delicious. When you sit at the bar looking straight, the view of the city is slightly obstructed by the shelves the bottles are on, however there is still a beautiful view at the bar. After a few sips into our drinks, we were politely greeted by a waitress and informed that our window seat was ready for us. I then closed out at the bar and we made our way to our window seats that offered breath taking views of the greatest city in America. We were greeted near immediately by the most efficient waiter I have ever been served by and two menus were placed on each of our plates, one wine menu and one food menu. After scanning the menu, my date and I were set on our orders and continued enjoying our drinks as we looked out of the window. As soon as we closed our menus, a bread boy came over and offered us some bread which was satisfying. Coming from a middle class guy contently living your average dunkin donuts coffee every morning lifestyle, dinner and drinks at the Top of the Hub will make you feel like Tony Soprano holding a royal flush on poker night. Our food came out quickly and was presented to perfection. I got the NY Strip medium rare accompanied by some sliced potatoes in some sauce, some green vegetable and of course, my strip. My strip was not a hockey puck and was not like taking a bite out of the cow, it was a great steak. My date got the 10oz Filet Mignon served on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side which she enjoyed. Our waiter did a fantastic job in all aspects and my highest regards are sent to this gentleman. When I saw him in passing and my date had used the restroom, I requested a Happy Birthday dessert and he caught my drift immediately.

If you go early (they open at 11 for lunch on weekdays - I've only been once for dinner), you'll have a great selection.  Go during/after the lunch rush, and it will be a bit more slim pickings.  \\n\\nBut I agree with other reviewers: the service is usually pretty slow, but they seem to under-staff the place, so its hard to blame the individual waitresses. We sometimes don't get a refill, and often have to flag somebody down for the check. Everybody there is really friendly though, so kudos there.

You know, you are a little nervous, but you end up having fun and learning a lot. What a metaphor... It was actually too sick, so many good dressing options. You could even sample dressings, like salt and straw but instead of ice cream you get salad haha. I got green goddess mixed with the nettle pesto, yummy.

If you live near this place it's worth a visit but don't go out of your way.\\n\\nThe long version:\\nI was very optimistic about this place having eaten at a Jinya Ramen Bar in New York.  \\n\\nI order the 'Jinya' Bun which is really just a pork bun with mayo. They charge $4 for one which is outrageous and I would definitely not recommend. It wasn't bad but not worth that money. \\n\\nFor my main I got the Spicy Chicken Ramen at the suggestion of the waiter. It came very fast and was hot. I like food spicy and thought the level was a little low but probably good for others. It had a nice heat. The noodles were thin which is never satisfying for me but what really threw me off was the chicken. The texture was odd and really detracted from the dish. The broth was easily the star and the best ramen broth I've had in Atlanta so far but not mind blowing. Just a solid broth.\\n\\nThe service is the reason to really avoid this place. The waiter was very pushy and asked us to order within minutes of sitting down. When I asked for a bit more time he gave me a funny look like I had said something ridiculous. Someone came and grabbed a chair from our table and asking us beforehand was an afterthought really. The waiter also dropped the check off while we were still eating and without us asking.\\n\\nI'd come back here only because of the limited options for ramen in Atlanta and because I work nearby here.

I have never been to the restroom at this location until tonight. Its in an inconvenient location for the ladies for not only the guests but as well as the servers and staff due to the fact you basically walk right through the server station to get to the restroom. I was with two other people tonight. My friend ordered the calamari which was awesome. For her entree she ordered blackened shrimp with broccoli which were cooked perfectly she said. My boyfriend ordered pot stickers which i did not try but he says were very good and his entree he ordered the philly cheese steak which he said was good. I ordered the seven oz steak rare with broccoli and a baked potato. My broccoli was raw and completely uncooked and my steak was cooked to a medium rare and charred on the top. The baked potato was over cooked but since i already was sending back my steak and broccoli i decided to tough it out and eat the potato while waiting on the recook of my food. The second time it came back half the broccoli was cooked, the other half was raw. The steak was rare however the top was charred again. I ate half the steak and the broccoli that was cooked because i didnt want to bother with sending it back again and waiting. We all three ordered alcoholic beverages and we were never carded (and we all look very young). When my food came back recooked a manager never came to my table to see if everything was satisfactory,  or for any reason at all. Im very disappointed in my experience tonight due to my expectations from my previous visit.

Back when it opened, it was a delightful and long-overdue addition to the West End's middling restaurant scene. I recommended it to everyone. I remember the room, food and especially the service being fantastic. Now, unfortunately, it seems to have slid down to the level of other offerings in the neighbourhood.\\n\\nThe room is still charming, but the food and the service have really lost their way. I'm not sure why this has happened. The dishes that I've sampled recently with friends have, to put it simply, lost their subtlety and flavour. Portions are huge (my dining companion ordered the roast chicken not expecting a HALF CHICKEN to show up in front of her), but quality trumps quantity any day. We both made it through our meals without anything standing out.\\n\\nBut what's really dismaying is the quality of the service. I remember shortly after opening having very fun/friendly conversations with the knowledgeable serving staff, making us feel welcomed and special. They've now been replaced with servers who seem either woefully inexperienced or teetering on the verge of rudeness. \\n\\nOur male server (likely the same guy mentioned in other reviews) was abrupt, dismissive and unfriendly. It was a Tuesday night, so the room wasn't especially busy, but he still made it seem like he was doing us a favour by serving us.

We walked, so while we didn't have to park, I have no safety concerns whatsoever for that area.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately and given water and menus.  Our waitress came over about 5 minutes later, and apologized for our wait. We didn't mind at all.  I ordered a glass of wine and the fish special: flounder. My husband ordered a Cesar salad and eggplant parm.  While we waited, we enjoyed their bread and pesto/olive oil sauce. The bread had a great crust and a delicious chewy texture - it took a lot of will power to only have one piece! The pesto could have been a little more flavorful, but was good.  The house pinot noir was typical, but nice.\\n\\nMy dinner was a pan roasted flounder with roasted yellow potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, the asparagus was grilled the perfect amount and the fish was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. I tried a bite of the sauce on my husband's eggplant parm.  It was very fresh tasting (I should have tasted the eggplant itself, but he wasn't sharing!).  (He did comment that the croutons on his Cesar salad were some of the best he'd ever had!)\\n\\nOverall, we had a great dinner. The pace of the waitstaff was perfect.

My life one-ups every time I consume those. And I've yet to find any place around Atlanta that comes even slightly close.\\n\\nOK, back to Folk Art and these hash browns with caramelized onions and pimento cheese. They are in the arena of \\"coming close\\". I love that you can customize your hash browns with various toppings.

There was a bar which I was seated at with my friend while we waited for the rest of her birthday party to join. We ordered a couple of drinks and the Salmon Chips to share, which were omg good. I could only eat two before they got too heavy, so good thing it didn't come with too many. It was a little salty, but bearable when I washed it down with my cocktail. The chips came out within 5 minutes of ordering, which I was very shocked and impressed with. Another friend joined after we finished the chips and ordered the mushroom toast, which came on strips of toast for us to share. Those were also the bomb, and reminded me of a previous meal I had earlier in the week at Bocado. The appetizer is simple but definitely a win. Finally, we had to get the calamari, which is usually a group favorite. Once again, our order appeared in about 5 minutes.

That, and I want to remember having eaten here. \\n\\nI dined here solo this Saturday evening, as I'm in the A for the weekend for work and wanted some authentic Southern food. Some friends of mine recommended this, and boy did they ever steer me right. Roast pork with cornbread stuffing and pork gravy ($11.50) is everything one would expect out of hearty southern fare; fork-tender pork loin roast cooked to perfection, served over impossibly soft cornbread dressing, and topped in rich gravy that, while by no means necessary to moisten the rest of the dish, is a very welcome and indulgent accompaniment. Entrees all come with two sides; I went with fried green tomatoes and hoppin' John. The fried green tomatoes breaded in cornmeal and buttermilk, and deep fried to perfection, and the classic black-eyed peas and rice combination goes great with the vinegary pepper sauce that sits on the table. Yeast rolls are buttery and delectable, as are the cornbread muffins and cinammon rolls (all of which, by the way, are included with entree). Pecan pie ($4.95) is the perfect cap to any meal here; the crust is perfectly flaky, the filling is not too sweet, and the pecans on top are far from stingy. \\n\\nService is reminiscent of legendary Southern hospitality, which adds to the charm. All in all, I'm somewhat happy that I don't live down here in Dixie, because I'd probably weigh 400 pounds if I ate like this with any degree of regularity.

We were seated on the front patio and our amazing food experience began.\\n\\nOur server was so nice and pleasant. She told us we could either order small plates to share or individual entrees- apparently people do it both ways. We wanted to try lots of things, so we ordered multiple dishes. We had the brussell sprouts (amazing), the hanger steak (perfectly cooked), the balsamic onions (good...but nothing too special...I would have preferred the cheesy cauliflower au gratin, but that's ok) and the  soft egg toast (to die for). To top it off we had a birthday cake ice cream sandwich...cake batter ice cream sandwiched with cookie dough sheets.

I supposed it was because it was often thought of as a tourist trap, but on a recent girls' weekend with some Boston newbies, I thought it would be the perfect spot for lunch.  \\n\\nThe old school wooden cabin contained an endless number of rooms, including a raw bar and souvenir shop downstairs, as well as various casual dining sections on the second floor.\\n\\nOur meal started with a large chunk of perfect corn bread that was neither too cake-y nor too dry.  Though it lacked the appearance of corn kernels, it still tasted natural and earthy.\\n\\nOne of the girls started with a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder, which was packed with clam meat and the perfect amount of cream.\\n\\nMy lunch portion of Grilled Salmon was topped with a thin layer of herbed breading, which was a disappointing surprise that was not referenced on the menu.  The fish was served over mixed greens, grilled asparagus, and cooked plum tomatoes, which had been sauteed in an seasoned oil.  The salmon was tasty, though I would have preferred it simply grilled.  The raw salad and roasted vegetables were all fresh compliments that created a substantial lunch-sized portion.  \\n\\nMy friends both ordered the house salad topped with a handful of crab cakes.  The small morsels were very basic and bread-heavy, but well-seasoned.  Unfortunately, they were not what you would expect from a seafood house.\\n\\nAll in all, the Union Oyster House provided more like a 3.5 star experience.

We were seated at a table just next to the hallway leading to the bathrooms, which I wasn't thrilled about, but given the size of the place, it's kinda hard to avoid.\\n\\nOur server wasn't very friendly, and I don't believe I saw her smile once.  She did a fine job presenting us with the specials and taking our orders, but she seemed bored and disinterested.\\n\\nOur bread arrived shortly with some tasty olive oil, olives, and eggplant, which we chowed down on until our caprese salad arrived.  The tomatoes were plump and flavorful, and the buffalo mozzarella creamy.  My dad had never tried buff. mozz. and was definitely pleased.  It could have used a little more salt and olive oil, but it was really tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nMy dad ordered the Chicken Marsala, which came with three mushroom dumplings.  The chicken was out-of-this-world moist.  I did a double-take, in fact.  I expected it to be a little stringy and dry from the looks of it, but it was completely the opposite.  Kudos to the chef for achieving a nice exterior while maintaining a succulent interior.\\n\\nMy GF's Gnocchi Sorrentino (which the server mispronounced), came in a small earthenware bowl piping hot and with more buffalo mozzarella oozing on the top.

I don't know what the hell these people are doing in that truck, but this is The Most Exquisite Thing I've Ever Put in My Mouth. \\n\\nDetroit-style pizza is ostensibly baked in an auto parts tray, transmitting additional heat capacity (can you tell I don't actually know what I'm talking about?) into the dough. Whatever the process, the result is that the crust is buttery and savory and unmatched. Even with great pizza like Home Slice, you're bummed out by the time you get to the crust. With Via 313 pizza squares, you're not left with a little baby arm of crust ... but you wish you were!!! That's how good it is. \\n\\nThis stuff is so spectacular that, when I wrote an email to my novelist friend, singing its praises, he was so amused that he had his latest protagonist introduce herself by waxing rhapsodic about the pie. She speaks of it like she would a hot new suitor, and there's a reason. Then he went and TRIED the stuff, and the laughter came to an abrupt halt as he moaned and gushed over The World's Greatest Pizza: By Far. \\n\\nThe cheese is the highest quality mix in pizza history, period. The tiny dime-sized pepperonis curl into delicate cups, lightly toasted on the edges. But I think the real star of the show is the marinara, which they ingeniously drizzle atop the rest, instead of stowing it beneath the cheese. This ain't no Phantom of the Opera! Why, other pizza places, do you hide your sauce away like a hideous freak?? I can only assume it's deeply saddened by its own mediocrity. \\n\\nIn closing, Via 313 pizza is GodSexLoveFood.

The location right in SoCo makes parking unreliable, but we got lucky and found something on the street nearby.\\n\\nSo, first off, it is probably one of the most beautiful and iconic trailers in Austin with the neon yellow CHICKEN sign.  People walking by are often stopping to take photos.  We ordered the 8 piece bucket with a little bit of everything else, like the truffle mac and cheese, cole slaw, and corn on the cob.  The 8 piece was $16, which seemed high, but whatever, it was worth it.  \\n\\nIt came out with a couple sweet roles and whole pickled jalapenos.  Chicken was hot!  Very crispy outside crust (which I like), just a tinge of pepper powder in the batter, but not spicy at all.  It was all legs and wing/shoulder parts, so no breasts/white meat, which was OK for me, but some people might want that.  Not sure if you can ask for it or not, but none were in our 8 piece.  Cole slaw was delicious, had a really light blue cheese dressing.  The corn on the cob was great, tons of butter, with lime that cuts the richness, spices/pepper sprinkled on top.  Very good.  The kids devoured the truffle mac and cheese so I didn't get to really try it.  One of my boys said that it was the best food he has ever had.  Pretty good endorsement from a five year old anyway!  He really like the rolls, which were sweet and dense.\\n\\nAll in all, a good meal, but it is right on Congress so the ambiance leaves much to be desired, but it is a trailer after all.  It just makes me wish it were a brick and mortar place, like a Lucy's Fried Chicken or something like that.  Not sure if it is BYOB, but certainly made me want to have a cold beer with my chicken.

It's worth acknowledging that my boo and I are in our early twenties, and that most folks at Alana's are noticeably older.  That's never been an issue until our last date there, about three weeks ago.  \\n\\nAs a Christmas present, my boyfriend treated us to the tasting menu, which runs $65 each for six courses and wine pairings.  We don't typically spend this much on meals but were more than willing to spend for the experience and the great food.  And yes, the food was wonderful.  The menu (or at least the website; I can't remember) clearly states that there is a kitchen fee of $5 or $10 each.  That was fine; it was acknowledged prior to the meal and it seemed straightforward.  However, our server acted as if coffee was included with the dessert menu - it ended up being $5 a cup.  Additionally, when she brought out the check she had added a 20% automatic tip and acted as if she was doing us a favor.  We found this to be incredibly insulting.  As folks who have worked in food service, we pride ourselves on being generous tippers - 20% is our typical minimum; 15% would be in response to mind-boggling terrible service.  And it's worth noting that service was decent, but the automatic 20% felt like a slap in the face, as if we wouldn't tip on the $150+ meal.  This has never happened previously, and I noticed that the other table in the room - a seven-top - didn't have this added to their final bill.  I couldn't help but assume that she'd done this since we're young.  While we have been loyal diners at Alana's, I can't help but feel unwelcome now.  We certainly won't be coming back anytime soon."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My and my roomie went there for Sunday brunch, amazing!

Heard such rave reviews so suggested Andina as the place to go for an early dinner after a matinee musical at the Keller.\\n\\nThe food was ok, not great so I can't understand the hype.  The house-made bread with 3 dipping sauces (peanut, passion fruit, and jalape√±o was pretty good).  The best part of dinner were the appetizers.  We had the empanadas and the crab-stuffed avocado with prawn.  They were delicious.  However I did not enjoy my entree which was the stewed lamb shank. It had way too strong of a cilantro flavor for me.  My girlfriends scallops on the other hand were very good.  So 1 out of 2 for dinner.\\n\\nFor dessert I chose the 3 pot of creme br√ªl√©e because I felt it was the less risky of all of them for not being awful.  My girlfriend got the cannoli --- it was served with 2 cannoli but she didn't enjoy it so only ate one.  She said the outside shell was too hard and just not good.  Again 1 out of 2 for dessert.\\n\\nI say 4 stars for food...and that is generous considering that 1 out of 2 entrees were not good as well as 1 out of 2 desserts getting a \\"fail\\"\\n\\nWhat brings the 4 stars down to 2 is our server.  He was very condescending and not pleasant at all.  For example, he was going through the special of the night and arrogantly was showing off his wonderful spanish pronunciation of the dish.  But hey...I don't know Spanish and since it wasn't on the menu I couldn't very well read it's description .  I tried to pronounce it and he corrected me and then I asked him what that was which is when he condescendingly said \\"I was about to explain it to you\\". People can say that pleasantly or deliver it in a way to be a jerk and he seemed to be a jerk.\\n\\nAlso, when we were trying to decide on appetizers, we asked him for his input as to the most popular or favorite dishes and he was a bit sarcastic when he said that they have quite a long list and many of them are popular.  I almost thought he didn't want to provide us with suggestions!  He did.  But, again...delivery is everything.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, service can really make it or break it for me and this time, it broke it. The restaurant is not cheap. In fact, it is on the pricier side, so I would expect a bit better service.\\n\\nFood just ok and service was very bad.  Could have been an off night for them.

The most horrible thing is that the female owner actually yelled at us when she saw we gave 10% tips. She asked 15% and We refused to give more. Then she shouted \\" get out\\" like crazy.

However, I usually only go here and the Pour House because I'm not a breakfast person.\\n\\nI love their blueberry pancakes.  The fresh blueberries give the pancakes a bitter kick so they aren't so sweet.  I hate sweets in the morning and this makes me actually like them.

I won't lie; the first few times I was there I was worried if I would be able to get a table after I ordered.  But it really does work.  There always ends up being a table to sit at when you are done.  No matter how crowded!  It's actually surprsing to me that this place is so popular for brunch on the weekends because it's not a place you linger around for hours. It's super packed and you feel kind of guilty sitting there for any more time than it takes you to eat.

The sweet & sour chicken had been packaged with the chicken and sauce separately which I appreciated to cut down on the soggy factor.

My disdain has nothing to do with the food, atmosphere, or the customer service--it is the WAIT.  Months ago, it would have been nothing for me to grab lunch at Chipotle multiple times per week.  But the long lines have gotten consistently worse.  As bad as it sounds, I wish the customers would turn away to encourage the owners to improve their wait time.  The Galleria Parkway (within a stone's throw) is one of Georgia's busiest work complexes.

It's my favorite breakfast food, I've tried french toast at almost every venue that offers french toast in Austin, even including the cake-dipped-in-egg-and-shouldn't-be-called-\\"toast\\" versions like they serve at Chez Zee and South Congress Cafe. ;)  So I was really excited to try my first drunken toast with drunken blueberry topping.\\n\\nIt was good.  \\n\\nI was a little disappointed when it came out pretty cool (in temperature) and didn't have that crisp outside, fluffy inside that I like so much.  It was a little limp and soggy.\\n\\nIt's alright though, because it was limp and soggy with maker's mark, and despite the lack of fluffy it tasted DELIGHTFUL.  \\n\\nThe boyfriend joined me in my brunch connoisseuring and got the Frank-tastic Four and seemed really pleased with his selections.  \\n\\nBonus Points: One of the only places in Austin that serves Intelligentsia coffee.  \\n\\nWe'll be back, I'm sure.

Choice of rice, fries or couscous.) $12.50 from the Dinner Plates section.  The nice lady behind the counter let us know that if we ordered two items off the Dinner Plates section that we'd get a nutella banana crepe free (deal not available on weekends).  But we decided to stick with what we had ordered plus one of the strawberries and nutella sweet crepes $6.35 for dessert.  All that plus a bottle of water came up to just over $29, but they also had water station available for those who were fine with good ole Boston water.\\n\\nThe crepes were both good and well filled.  The dinner plate was generous and prettily plated with carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, and a scoop of hummus topping the salad half.  The lamb kabob plate could have potentially filled the appetite of a hungry individual, while the savory crepe the tummy of a lighter weight.  But together, along with the sweet crepe, it quite satisfied the three of us, including our sweettooths.\\n\\nAfter we were done, we busted our own tables and made use of their rather chilly facilities that is available for customers only.\\n\\nBring some cash in case you don't hit their $7 minimum credit card charge.\\n\\nI'd like to come back sometime to try their Tuscany (pesto-scented chicken, roma tomato, spinach, sundried tomato and buffalo mozzarella) Signature Crepe $6.95 or fruity french toast ($6.25 or $5.25)."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great for their small plates.

Without question, the strongest item on the menu is the cannoli. The breadsticks are hot and very tasty, although they do occasionally go overboard on the garlic salt. The alfredo sauce is, well, alfredo sauce - parmesan cheese and cream. It doesn't get any better than that, really. The pizza's great. Duh. The calzones are even better.

The portions are not very consistant for the price as my boyfriend and I each got the chowder and mine was an obvious inch lower than his in a tiny bowl. The Fra Diavlo was excellent though."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So bear in mind that I was predisposed to like this place simply from reading all the deliciousness with bacon on the menu. Additionally, I got a Google coupon ($10 for $20) and usually when I'm getting a price break it makes me like something even more (you know....how free or really cheap food generally tastes better and the more expensive it is the higher your standards?). What I really use as a yardstick to determine how good a place is, is whether I want to go back. Unfortunately, I will probably never eat at Frank again. \\n\\nFirst of all, there is the fact that before you even get inside the door, you have probably had to pay for parking (for us that was $10). I took my 12 yr old son and for the 2 of us we had only one tea (my son had water), 1 small appetizer (bite sized corn-dogs made with little smokies), 2 hot dogs (\\"porked\\" chili cheese dog for him and a \\"porked\\" nacho dog for me), 1 side each (small waffle fries for him and corn cup for me) and then we shared 1 piece of chocolate bacon and 1 chocolate chip bacon cookie. The tab before tip was $31 before deducting my Google coupon. When you add tip and the parking to that, it seems pretty expensive, at least to me. \\n\\nFor the place itself, we found that it had a charming older feel and they had a neat lounge area where sadly no one was congregating (maybe because it was only 6ish). Since there was just 2 of us, they sat us on what looks to be a stage where they squeezed several tables for two. My son pointed out how dangerous it was because many of the diners' chairs were just inches away from a drop off, with no lip or anything to keep from scooting backward off the elevated area. A little later on he scoped out the 2nd floor area and agreed that if we ever came back we would sit up there since it seemed a bit more fun and cozy.  \\n\\nNow about the food, I thought everything tasted good but not so good that it blew me away. Not sure if it is a positive or negative, but I was amazed by how unmessy the dogs were. The buns were toasted or something so that they didn't fall apart which is a good thing but then the toppings weren't all ooey-gooey which to me had an impact on the taste. The chili had the consistency of Spackle and didn't have much chili flavor. My nacho dog had some delicious refried beans (I think they might make them from their \\"ranch\\" beans because they tasted a bit like what I would imagine Ranch-Style beans would taste like all mashed up). The Nacho dog was supposed to come with beans, cheese, sour cream, pico and jalapenos. I asked to leave the pico off (I don't like tomatoes much) and have some raw onion. That was a 25 cent extra charge and I realized when paying the bill that the dog didn't have onions, sour cream or jalapenos. I didn't say anything at that point since it seemed silly to debate over 25 cents and I wasn't planning on going there again even if they offered me a free dog at a later date.\\n\\nMy son and I both got our hot dogs \\"porked\\" because it sounded too good to pass up (it is where they stuff it with white american, wrap it in bacon, and then fry it). While good in theory, the execution wasn't that good. We couldn't see any actual cheese and have to assume it ran out into the oil when it got hot. I think I expected all these wonderful flavors to really knock me over, and that is why it was a bit underwhelming. I had the corn cup and that was probably the most delicious item I had. My son had the waffle fries and agreed they were good, but certainly no different than the waffle fries at Pluckers or even Chick-Fil-A. The chocolate covered bacon was good but the chocolate was more thick than I imagined and it was cold (wasn't exactly what I was expecting). On the cookie, bear in mind that although the menu implies that the cookie has chocolate chips and bacon in it., in actuality it is pretty good chocolate chip cookie with bacon crumbled over it and dusted with powdered sugar. It tasted good in a sweet and salty way, but wasn't what I would think of as a \\"bacon\\" cookie if you know what I mean.\\n\\nLastly, I feel I should touch on the service. Not sure if our waiter assumed he would get a lousy tip because we were using the coupon and it was just me and my son, but the service was not that good (so self-fulfilling prophecy he only got a $5 tip). We heard him assure a lady sitting near us that all the fries were fried in a separate fryer since she had to be gluten free and wanted to make sure there was no cross contamination, and my son said he was lying since our corn-dogs came with a fry stuck to them which would lead us to believe they were fried in the same oil. \\n\\nSo in conclusion, the food was okay but certainly not worth the trouble and expense of going there. I thought the drinks looked good and can only assume that when you have been drinking and you're ravenously hungry the food tastes much better. Either way, feel free to try it yourself; you can have our seats since we won't be seeing you there :)."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We ordered a dozen random doughnuts and by that I mean we let a staff member choose 12 doughnuts and surprise us.

I have been coming to this location for about 6-7 months now and I have only grown more and more frustrated over that period of time, to the point now where I refuse to return here. Tonight I placed an online order about an hour and ten minutes before picking up. When you place an online order a phone number is required with their reasoning being \\"we will contact you if there are any questions/inquiries regarding your order.\\" It is now 2 minutes before my scheduled pickup time, I am standing at the unmanned register while witnessing one of the employees shout out the following to the ~10 or so people standing in line: \\"we are out of chicken, lettuce, guacamole, corn salsa, and guacamole.\\" I will elaborate on this stocking issue in a moment. Everyone in line the proceeded to turn around and walk out of the restaurant. Keep in mind that this is 30 minutes before closing. How they expect to serve people for the remainder of their shift is beyond me. So here I am, finally being acknowledged at the register with a, \\"can I help you?\\" while at the same time my phone starts ringing. One of the employees in back was calling me to inform me that they couldn't fulfill my order. Really? It had been well over an hour since I placed my order. They decide to wait until I have already driven to their location and am standing at the register, after I have already learned of their shortcoming, to call me and give me the heads up that they can't fulfill my order. Had I received this notification early enough I could have picked up food somewhere else, no big deal. However at this point the only other options I'd consider for a quick fix meal late at night are closed. \\n\\nThis is not the first time this has happened, but rather it is a reoccurring issue. I never encountered the problem of this location running out of several key ingredients until about two months ago, and since then my girlfriend and I joke about it every time I place an online order or talk about picking something up. \\"Make sure you have a backup plan.\\" Well it strikes again. How can a store that consistently has a 20+ minute line wait seemingly so often be unprepared to complete a shift fully stocked on ingredients? This has happened at least four times in the year 2015 already, and it has come to the point where I only try this location once every two weeks anyways (so who knows how often it is happening otherwise!). \\n\\nLong lines, inconsistent portions (be careful who is prepping your bowl that day when you decide to spend $1.80 on guacamole, chances are you'll get shorted), inability to maintain stock levels (only can confirm this being an issue for final hour of operation but is a routine problem), lack of consideration/attentiveness with online orders in calling me promptly regarding their inability to complete my order, I am done with this location. I love the brand and will continue to be a customer at other locations but never again on Cobb Parkway. I have given them far too many chances.\\n\\n**Quick edit: I gave this location 2 stars simply because they have given me many a great service in the past. That, however, all seemed to end right around the time the calendar turned to 2015.

To go all meta-Yelp, I'll just say it: \\"I really wanted to like this place...\\" but, lo, it wasn't quite there. First, the positive:\\n\\nThe design was masculine but stylish. I believe the two comparisons I made while there were \\"like eating in a Restoration Hardware showroom\\" and \\"what I imagine the inside of Cary Grant's colon to look like.\\" As a guy who appreciates dark woods and leather-bound books, I liked the look. The details were even played out in the drink menus, all bound in hard covered works of literature any high school senior might recognize. (Ours was \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" natch.) And for a total sensory experience, take a deep sniff of the leather case when you get your check. Old leather, indeed, Hai Karate it's not.\\n\\nThe service was pleasant. Sure, the drinks took their time to arrive, but seeing the crowd about, I didn't mind. When we sat, we were regaled with a brief history of King+Duke. \\"Most dishes are cooked over an open hearth!\\" \\"We have an extensive wine list!\\" \\"King+Duke gets their name from two characters from Huckleberry Finn!\\"\\n\\n\\"Ah,\\" I thought. \\"I guess better two of literature's most famous con men than, say, a certain gentleman who could also be just called 'Jim.'\\"\\n\\nYou might think K+D's affectations overly precious, but I didn't mind. I sound like I do, but, really, I didn't.\\n\\nThe crowd was...Buckhead, almost stereotypically so. Based on some of the bleached teeth and over-tans I saw, it's not just the drink menus bound in leather. A quick minority check (as we brown people tend to do when confronted with such a situation) yielded....well, that one guy. That dude over there. And me. Don't get me wrong. I won't and don't hold any of this against King+Duke. I just talk about the crowd as a way of setting the scene. The three stars were about the food.\\n\\nThe food started off well enough. The complimentary popovers were, as Mark Twain himself might have put it, friggin' DOPE. I know. I had more than my allotted share thanks to a gluten-free wife and friends who feel that carbs should be met with a skepticism. We ordered more food. That's when my excitement dwindled.\\n\\nThe deviled eggs were, overall, not the best I've had in this city. They tasted, well, like your standard run of the mill deviled eggs. Oh, did I mention only three come per order? The \\"bar steak\\" was pretty good. Again, good is good, mind you, but good ain't GREAT. Also, I'm fairly sure it didn't come medium rare as designated, but I can't be too sure since a sauce covered the meat, making a color check of the meat's interior all but impossible. Again, a \\"good\\" sauce, but also, again, I'm pretty sure the steak was served at a strong medium. The pork loin? Again, \\"fine\\" was the operative word, but when it came to the skin--the chicharrone and traditionally best part--that operative word turned to \\"shoe leather.\\" Also, for being cooked over an open flame, I would've thought that the smoke would've been more pronounced in our dishes. That might be by design, but if so, I feel that's a mistake.\\n\\nFinally, about my companions' \\"Duke\\" Burger(s)--I believe they opined, \\"It was good, but not really worth $16.\\" Which brings me to my conflict. K+D met most objective metrics. Good service, great space, an attention to detail I appreciated. But the food didn't measure up to the price which, in all honesty, isn't THAT expensive, but it's not that cheap either. Do I factor in our cocktails? My wife liked hers (enough that I never had a chance to try it.) My root beer flip tasted a like a white russian had kids with an A&W. That's not a bad thing, but not exactly refreshing on a hot summer day. But ordering that is my fault.\\n\\nSo I don't know. Three stars? Four? Three and a half? Dammit.

It was mixed with onions, a cream sauce and some peppers and presented an interesting assortment of flavors. The dish included some home-fired potatoes. Of course, it was topped with a pair of poached eggs. There were four of us at the table, Our friend split a benedict order--they are regulars there. The orders were taken soon after we settled in and delivered quickly and accurately.

I have never been more disgusted with the way I was treated at an establishment in my life! I am appalled at the way my boyfriend and I were spoken to by one of the employees last night. \\n\\nWe came in to order food. I ordered a burrito bowl. The gentleman preparing the tortillas and serving the rice, beans, and meat was very polite. The girl that was then serving the remaining ingredients was extremely rude. It was obvious that she didn't want to be there. She was sloppily throwing ingredients into my bowl (guac in the corner, sour cream in the other corner, soupy tomato salsa that she couldn't care to drain) she was trying to rush so fast (no line when we arrived) that she wasn't even listening to what I was asking for... That was just the beginning. \\n\\nMy boyfriend, Who was right behind me, ordered a quesarito. Again, the same girl who was being sloppy with my food (and his because she had to scoop off ingredients since she decided she wasn't going to listen to his order either) began to wrap his quesarito. while she is doing this all of the contents of the quesarito fell out and she was unable to close it. This was no longer a burrito of any kind. She then tried to cover it up by putting the side that was open on the bottom and covering it up with aluminum foil. (We are aware that sometimes this is something that happens. In most cases, the chipotle employee will a) ask if you would like it remade, or b) automatically grab a new tortilla and transfer the contents to the new one without the customer having to ask. Once we realized she was trying to cover it up, my boyfriend asked her if she could remake it. Her immediate snappy response was \\"I CANT HELP IT IF IT RIPS!\\" We both said we know that but clearly it needs to be remade. It wasn't even a burrito anymore. The two women who were in line behind us agreed saying they would not have accepted that either. The associate then goes \\"well do you want me to put it in a bowl?!... Do you want  new aluminum foil?!\\" To which my boyfriend replied \\"no I would like a quesarito\\" ..... because this is what he asked for in the beginning. She spent more time going back and forth with us over not remaking the food than it would have actually taken to prepare another quesadilla for the quesarito. (Let me just say that my boyfriend orders this every time we go to chipotle... It is always wrapped properly. We have never had a problem before. She just clearly didn't want to do it) \\n\\nSo then I suggested to her that it should be prepared again but this time, they could probably go a little lighter on the rice and beans because there was a lot. Her next smart response (WITH EXTREME ATTITUDE) was \\"Oh so you want less food?\\" ... At that point I decided I was done speaking with her. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to leave. The only reason we stayed was because he really wanted the food that we came in there for..... The girl then just storms off and says something Like \\"you deal with them\\" to another associate who then comes to continue our order (at this point there is a line. The two ladies who were in agreement with me that were behind us had both completed their orders and checked out by this point) the associate who took over our order (not sure if she was a manager or not.) then says \\"do you want me to put this in a bowl\\" smh.... AGAIN, NO we would just like a quesarito.... FINALLY, They prepared a new one and this time it was prepared correctly and we were finally able to leave. A 3rd girl rang us up and she was very polite. At no point did we ever receive an apology for the way we were treated. It was ridiculous.

The front, street-facing part of it is actually a take-out counter, but also has three small tables for diners. The dining room is actually in the BACK of the restaurant and you have to leave the front of the restaurant and walk a few feet outside to get to the dining room.

I had the steak tips (delicious!), and the other people I was with had the seafood risotto (totally savory) and the salmon (again, delicious, and non-fishy-tasting). The only low point of the evening for me was the tiramisu I had for dessert. It was okay, but considering it was an italian restaurant, I expected better. It almost tasted SOUR. Ewe.

First of all, my pizza took quite a while, which is fine because it was a busy Thursday night, but is just something to be aware of as this is a very popular place. If I'm being honest, it definitely wasn't the greatest (American) pizza of my life. I LOVE artichoke, but there were hardly any on the pizza and the sparsely scattered few had hardly any flavor. \\n\\nAll in all, my pizza was a huge disappointment. I have to take medication to be able to eat gluten, and so eating something like pizza is a big deal for me - a real splurge, so this felt like a waste of my medication. That being said, the main reason I am giving this pizzeria such a low rating was the price. Somehow, a single large margherita pizza with one added topping cost just under $35, which is absolutely ridiculous when a large costs $22 without the artichoke, and of course, I did not receive an itemized receipt to verify the price of anything. I believe I was overcharged (this isn't Italy where you pay to simply have a seat) and I would have said something at the time, but I was on a first date and that is not the time/place, so I'm saying it now. Incredibly disappointed in the quality and the cost of the pizza, but at least I had a great time talking with my date, who was high quality and priceless. \\n\\nIf you do decide to come here, make sure you ask for an itemized receipt so they don't overcharge you like they did for me.

I had a serious crush on the place, from the tofu bacon to the Tom Waits shrine over the bar, and would not let out-of-town friends leave Austin without a visit there.  I was filled with dread when I heard that their 10-year lease was coming to an end and they would likely have to move, but Leslie, the owner, told me she was trying to expand into the old tire store 2 blocks south, so I took heart, and waited.  And hoped.\\n\\nAnd I wasn't disappointed.  I think the new location is great.  It's easily twice the size of the old one, with 4 times the parking, and they've expanded the menu.  The food is consistently great, and it's up there with the best vegetarian cafes I've ever been to.  It's a true Austin gem.\\n\\nI'm a bit taken aback by the reviewers who claim the atmosphere is gone; the only thing I see missing are the people who would take up a 4-top table by themselves with their laptop, books, papers and one cup of coffee for HOURS, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the place was invariably packed.  I don't miss those people.\\n\\nIf you feel like something has been lost in the move, console yourself with the thought that the likely other option was not to stay put in the old location, but to close up shop.  Would that have been preferable?  Better yet, if you miss the old place so badly, why not open your own coffee shop there?  The building's been vacant for almost 6 months now; doesn't seem to be much of a bidding war to snatch it up...\\n\\nAs for me, Tom Waits still presides over the bar, the tofu bacon still kicks ass, the Neal taco still cures what ails you, and Bouldin Creek remains one of my favorite things about Austin.

It wasn't until five or six years ago that I met some people that moved from Oregon and told me about Voodoo Doughnuts. They did not need to explain it very long. Instantly I wanted to go there.\\nSteven and I went on a train ride to Portland the other day. A 24 hour whirlwind tour of downtown Portland. We decided to keep our list of destinations small and simple so we could see our priority sites without getting in a wild race to get back to the train on time the next day. We both agreed that Voodoo Doughnuts was one of those priority sites that we had to go to.\\nWe were overjoyed to see that the place was open 24 hours a day so we did not need to hurry. Even at 9 o'clock at night there was a line going outside the door but we figured that we were not getting the full brunt of the line since it was not during the day or the morning. \\nInstantly Voodoo Doughnuts exhibited it's wild charms. Approaching the building and getting in line we could see their space that they occupied on the outside was painted in gold glitter on the bricks. Wonderful!\\nVoodoo Doughnuts only accepts cash so it is a good idea to bring some before getting in line. I think they have a ATM you can use on the inside of the store but don't quote me on that. \\nOnce we were inside, oh the choices! So much to pick from! I had to get a black Voodoo Doughnuts T-shirt in purple and green design and lettering. Steve said he would buy it for me. Happy Birthday! The cashier that got our doughnuts was bubbly and friendly. It seemed like she actually enjoyed working there despite the throngs of people constantly there. She advised me when I said I wanted a Large t-shirt that the sizes run small and that their shirts shrink some as well. So we went with an XL. Very nice to know! \\nNow onto the dougnuts! I got the Mexican Hot Chocolate Doughnut under their Devil's Food category and the vanilla and coconut doughnut. Steve got the same vanilla doughnut and the Gay Bar which had Fruit Loops on it and filled with cream. All of doughnuts we ordered were great but I settled on the Mexican Hot Chocolate Doughnut as my favorite.

The cheese inside was not nearly melted and the pepperoni was still cold. I showed the waitress and she left the calzone on the table and talked to the cook; both of whom are the owners. She came back to tell me that he used a biotherm thermometer and that it should be perfect. \\nI asked her to look at the calzone to just see that it wasn't cooked and I got eye rolling and no interest in what we were saying. At that point, I decided that I wasn't okay with the penne and I wanted the fettucine. I pointed out to her that my dish was supposed to come with fettucine and she explained to me that the only way to put the order into the computer was to put in penne. I asked if they had fettucine and she said yes, so I said then it must be possible to make the dish as indicated on the menu.\\n\\nI asked for the food to go, as I didn't want to deal with it anymore. The owner/chef then came to our table to see why we weren't satisfied with the food. I explained both the calzone and the penne/fettucine issues. He insisted that the calzone was cooked. I again asked him to look at it and his only response was to say, \\"Well I guess I need a new thermometer.\\" with attitude. I politely asked him to take the calzone off the bill and we'd be leaving. The waitress/owner took the calzone away and both of them were quite rude to us throughout the conversation. \\n\\nI decided that we were done with this interaction and just wanted to leave. I told him that I didn't want to take any of the food, nor pay the bill and we would be leaving. He told me that I shouldn't have eaten any of the penne if I didn't want it. I explained to him that I didn't bring it up right away because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt and only brought it up after the response to the uncooked calzone was so poorly handled. He then criticized me for wanting to return something that I had eaten 3-4 forkfuls of. Mind you the plate was heaping with penne, chicken, spinach, tomatoes, and sauce. I quickly explained that if he wanted to charge me a pro-rated amount for the bites I had taken divided into the entire dish, I would. I was being sarcastic, but he was being absurd.\\n\\nBy the time the interaction was over, the chef had lost his cool. I tried to explain to him that what just happened didn't need to go the way that it did.

We found this hidden place of awesomeness while trying to avoid holiday traffic from the nearby mall, and fell in love.  When you see it from the outside, it's meh at best.  The signage describing the cuisine inside is what brought us in, and, to paraphrase another's assessment, it's as if you're transported to a cosy little Thai diner the moment you walk through that front door.  The decor is very \\"South Pacific\\", in style and feel and very reminiscent of the movie itself.  We are always greeted very quickly by a friendly staff member and asked where we would like to sit.  Seriously?!  Where would we LIKE to sit?  How many establishments can you name who ask that?  \\nI judge all Asian restaurants offering the dish on their preparation of Cashew Chicken, an old obsession of mine.  Throw in the Thai Tea I remember and expect to be perfect, not a glass packed with ice and a drip or two of tea, and you've got yourself a loyal customer.   I have a chef friend who's from Thailand and makes the best I've ever had, but his place is too far to drive just for a glass of tea.  Sorry Chai!  \\nI'm certain you can tell what I ordered, but my Gorgeous always gets something different, and we have both branched out since.  Nothing here has ever disappointed either of us.  The food is fantastic.  The service is always perfect.  The bill is never too crazy considering what we get.  We've only limited our returns there in an effort to give other places a chance.  \\n\\nChef Brain:\\n\\nThe cashew chicken dish served here is not lacking in the two main ingredients.  The industry standard in most small places is to fill the plate with vegetables and rice and then TOP the dish with a stingy garnish of a slice of chicken and a few nuts.  This is not the case here.  There are certainly other ingredients on the plate, some bell peppers and onions, but there is a balance to it that works beautifully.  \\n\\nThe Sweet and Sour Pork or Chicken is a long standing favorite of my Gorgeous, though I am not entirely fond of it.  The dish itself is actually very good, packed with flavor, and not at all lacking in the main ingredient chosen.  My issue with it is that I do not personally like that the meat is battered and fried.  While growing up in CA, I was exposed to Asian food in nearly every city, including LA's Chinatown.  Perhaps it was just a luck of the draw kind of thing, but I never experienced the battered and fried chunks of meat variant of this dish until moving to the south.  The onions, bell peppers, and pineapple chunks bathed in the sweet and sour sauce are, thankfully, fully cooked before being plated.  I've never asked that they not batter the meat for the dish, but I'm sure they would be happy to oblige.  \\n\\nThe Garlic and Black Pepper Beef is served on a bed of steamed shredded cabbage and sliced carrots and sprinkled with roasted Garlic flakes is a huge success.  It can be a bit heavy on the back pepper at times, but during cold season that is totally fine by me.  The beef is my favorite option of meat, and it is never over cooked.  I love the crispy garlic flakes on top, but think they should make butter browned garlic in house for this.  That is my only change I would make.  \\n\\nOur all time favorite dessert here is an odd one for most Americans not accustomed to this style of food.  It is only available if they can get the fruit fresh, and I love that they care about the quality.  The Sticky Rice with Mango slices is something that you just have to try.  Sweet Sticky Rice steamed with coconut cream and Pandan fragrance, topped with Coconut Cream Sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and topped with slices of Fresh Mango.  We were a bit wary of this one at first glance, but I wanted to try it and we devoured the hell out of this dessert.  It's very similar to a Mexican style rice pudding, adding coconut and pandan, and topping it with mango slices.  Be sure to eat it quickly, as the rice loses its jelly-like texture as it cools to a more solid form.  The flavors are unchanged, but the texture of soft warm sweet rice is just amazing."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Down right, just GOOD ole pizza !!!

The menu goes beyond simple pizza/calzone/wings - the Mediterranean items were particularly interesting.  In hind sight, perhaps we should have ordered the Med. sampler (hummus tabouleh and all that good stuff), and then split a calzone.  Instead, we had a split: half white pizza for my son, and the Ray's special for me, with a pitcher of Stella.  I'd say the pizza price is somewhat on the high side.  Most places, you can get a large or what some call extra large for $18.  But at $13, the Stella was a bargain. I don't think this was the 64 oz. pitcher (at least I HOPE it wasn't 64, which means I'll have to get back onto the elliptical...), but even at 48 oz., it's a steal for a premium import.  My just-turned-21 son did not live up to his end of the bargain on the beer (THANK GOODNESS!); tempted to do otherwise, we left with Stella still in the pitcher.  \\n\\nThe pizza looked small upon arrival (I'd say 14\\", not 16\\"), but as it turned out, it was quite enough for me.

The rellena - I could have done without.

Lamb shank, a must do! Simply delicious and quite tender. Great flavor all around. The Pestado... well, it turned on us. The fish was very decadent and cooked perfectly; however, it's in a pork sauce (almost like a soup). While we did read that on the menu, we didn't think it'd be a deterrent. It was however.

I had a bit of an appetite so I ordered the Large Beef Flank with Noodles (9.95). Holy...I didn't realize that the 1.50 difference between the small and the large was so massive! You get a much larger portion of beef, noodles and their pickled vegetables in the large...you can almost split it with 2 people. The beef was very tender, plentiful, and cut in large pieces. The noodles were also well done as they were very chewy, and again, it seemed bottomless lol. The broth had a rich flavouring to it that reminded me of beef stew. \\n\\nAlso got an extra side order of the Sour Mustard vegetable. It's good for cleaning your palate, like pickles after eating a hamburger.

I'm not looking for ranch or blue cheese or something similar at a bistro type place but a homemade vinagrette would have been welcome. Nothing worse than a naked salad. Blah.

A little too much onion though, which apparently was the case in most of the first courses that night.

Apparently  that six dollar burger will cost you close to six dollars now, and in a small combo? Seven bux plus.\\n\\nI rolled into our brand new neighborhood Carl's Jr., today, to fortify myself for a road trip I am leaving on shortly (yes, many burgers will be consumed!).  This  gleaming structure opened a couple months ago, replacing a KFC (which we miss, actually).\\n\\nThe counter girl mumbled something about \\"Would you like to try our XXXXX six dollar burger?\\"  And I replied, \\"why yes, I think I would.\\"\\n\\nI glanced at the menu board and ordered the Original Six Dollar Burger combo (about $7.50), which is described on the Carl's website at charbroiled 100% Angus beef patty, two slices of melted American cheese, two slices of tomatoes, mayo, mustard, pickles, ketchup and red onions on a toasted sesame seed bun.\\n\\nI was the only dining room customer.  The counter lady gave me my number and I waited - about 8 minutes.  No sweat.   Now, the difference between what I ordered and what I received?  I received the big beef patty, between toasted sourdough bread, a couple kinds of cheese, and bacon.   I know they used to offer something like that in the six dollar line, but I don't see it on the current menu.  Whatever.\\n\\nIt's pretty tasty.  Unlike the \\"big 3\\", this patty actually tastes like beef.  It's a shitload of calories and carbs, for sure.\\n\\nCarl's also features \\"natural cut fries\\" now (I have never figured out what \\"unnatural cut\\" would mean), and they were pretty OK.  Better than Wendy's product of the same ilk.  They still taste similar to an extruded product to me.\\n\\nWould I have it again? I think so.  But maintaining my girlish figure would require me to skip the bread and fries.   With a fork, the six dollar burger would be quite nice.  I'd like to pay less, of course.\\n\\nAnd by the way?  100% Angus beef?  Yawn. 80% of the beef cattle in the US are Angus.

We took our daughter the other night and all 3 pizzas were burnt and bitter. ALL the pizzas coming out of the oven looked burnt and they had no problem serving them. The salads, arugula and asparagus, were drowning in dressing. I would have much preferred more greens and less dressing, it was overpowering. We were there early, at 5:30 so busy was not an excuse. For the price and portions at Pizzeria Locale, I expect more. Very disappointed. \\n\\nOriginal Review\\nOne of my favorite quick lunch places. I get a clean, fresh arugula salad, limoncello and Salsiccia peperoni pizza every time. I've yet to leave unhappy from the food. One thing I particularly like about Pizzeria Locale is their menu layout. The pizza is divided between red and white sauce options. \\nTheir gluten free crust is delicious, though I prefer the traditional. It's best to get your own pizza too, unless you're sharing equally, but beware, someone is going to get robbed, there are no pizza rollers to be seen in this establishment. \\nThe interior is industrial-chic-vintage-subway tile bathroom-esc.

A group of us walked in about 10:00 pm, with trivia going on full blast.  A couple of us ordered first and when the rest of us went to order after the cashier/order-taker disappeared for about 10 minutes, we were informed that the \\"kitchen is closed, and you will need to go down to the end of the bar to order drinks\\".  Well, that was highly disappointing, but, it looked like we were going to get to try one of the signature cocktails, boozy milkshakes, or decent selection of drafts.  We stood in front of the 3 bartenders for another 10 minutes, before finally being told that the bar was closed. We did not notice a sign with the hours on it, but admittedly, we didn't look as there was music, trivia, and people filling the tables when we walked up.\\n\\nI will say that the Grindhouse staff was more interested in leaving than serving its guests.  Since we came in together, I would have thought that we should have all been able to order, but that wasn't the case.  It would have been nice to be informed that ALL services had stopped, not just the kitchen, saving me more unnecessary waiting around for the staff to finish whatever they were doing (cleaning, closing, and playing trivia, it appeared).  In defense of the bartenders, when they noticed I was visibly angry for being treated like this, they did offer to allow me to order a drink, which I refused so that I could ensure that they could get home on time.\\n\\nI don't want to tell anybody how to run their business, but it would seem to me that if there is an active event going on and customers are walking through your door, serving them would be a priority.  Maybe this restaurant has too many customers and has the luxury of turning them away.  Maybe this is one of those hip rude-restaurant sort of establishments.  Maybe I just caught them on an off night.  But, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  I am usually willing to give everyone a second chance, and probably will with these guys too at some point.

We were asked twice, so we thought they'd bring out a little dessert for him or something... you know.. since they asked twice and all......  LOL... but they didn't.

While at the restaurant we couldn't really place our orders when we wanted to... Our server had us wait and place apps and dinner together....

Tried the Mango Jalape√±o off the drink menu. The bartender double checked to make sure I like spicy. Very polite and a nice touch making sure I would like it. It was smooth with just the right amount of heat. On to the appetizer - I tried the coconut shrimp, they were good but they came out so fast, I am not sure they weren't being held in the kitchen. They were hot and the sauce added flavor. Otherwise, they were just ok. For my entree, I opted for the Siam Black Tiger Shrimp and Scallop Stir Fried. It was tasty and even better with a little chili oil added for some heat. The sauce was sweet and savory served with rice and veggies. I asked for dessert options and was directed to the Suspen Cake. It was absolutely delightful. Red velvet cake with a layer of mascarpone cheese in the middle with little balls that burst of mango flavor when bitten in to. On the outside was chocolate icing almost like ganache (I could be totally wrong) & topped with a bing cherry. \\nThis seems to be the kind of place that would be a neighborhood hangout where it appears the staff have a lot of regulars that come in.

Neither tasted like real sesame or kung pao at a real Asian food place, but again, it's not supposed to be authentic.

We came in around 4, yet there was no way that food was sitting there in a warming pan since lunch ~ well, maybe the rice, but it kinda' has to be.  The breading on the shrimp was VERY crispy and so were the snap peas and carrots in the beef.  Yum!  And it was all HOT, fresh from the stovetop.\\n\\nThe only reason they didn't get five stars was because the rice just a little dry, there wasn't quite enough sauce on the entrees, and the chili sauce was more like that Spanish red chili-pepper sauce ~ not a lot of oil and mushy peppers (I like the oily kind with the firm peppers).  If they keep their rice in a steamer maybe (or moisten it a bit somehow), add just a few more tablespoons of sauce to the entrees, and switch to the other kind of chili sauce, they'll get five stars from me.  \\n\\nIf you're expecting authentic Asian food and to not have to wait on yourself, then go to an authentic Asian restaurant and pay thirty bucks plus tip instead of the twenty total we paid.

My initial experience trying to make a reservation should have been enough to make us go elsewhere but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

I've never had a restaurant that encourages reservations act like it's an inconvenience to talk to a future customer.

She said \\"I can't guarantee it has shellfish but also can't guarantee it doesn't\\". Such a bizarre response to a genuine concern about a food allergy just about ruined my husband's overall impression but we decided to stay and ordered the tasting menu. At $75 per person it was expensive, but the food and wine pairings were overall very good. We were sitting outside (our choice) and were the only ones out there as it got later and cooled down. We didn't see our server much except for when she brought out each course. We were unpleasantly shocked to see an automatic 20% gratuity added to our bill. Remember, we were a party of 2. The tasting menu did have a pre-disclosed $5 per person \\"kitchen surcharge\\" which seemed unnecessary (can't you just charge more for the tasting menu?) but the tipping was not disclosed anywhere that I noticed.

So, when you walk in and see that, amidst a dozen or so virtually empty shops, the entire occupancy of the building appears to be crammed into and overflowing out from this one tiny restaurant, you know something interesting is going on. Be prepared for a wait, but they will text you so you can track your place in line.\\n\\nI'm no expert on ramen per se, but \\"soup\\" has always been my favorite food, and encountering this one led me to spend several days thinking about nothing but ramen, coming back multiple times as well as going to other restaurants for comparison. My first taste of the Tan Tan ramen was almost a religious experience as the combination of sesame-based broth and chili oil was such a beautiful flavor that I had nothing to compare it to.\\n\\nWhen I looked up the story of this place, it began to make sense. It's not a chain. Chef Ken Iwaoka is personally responsible for creating this unique location in 2015, exclusively specializing in Sapporo-style ramen. Sapporo-style appears to refer to cooking all the ingredients and broth together in a wok (in contrast to, say, placing all the ingredients in the bowl and then pouring hot broth over it). The noodles and many of the ingredients are sourced directly from Japan and they offer a very limited menu in order to provide a consistently excellent experience.\\n\\nMy experience with the dishes so far, as a new ramen convert, is as follows. For those as uninitiated as I was until recently, my perception is that the primary difference is which flavor of broth you choose, and then some variations in the toppings (in a similar fashion to how you would choose flavors and toppings to construct an ice cream sundae). You can add as many additional toppings as you like, but I chose to try the default versions until I better understood what I was ordering.\\n\\nTan Tan Ramen - The uniqueness of this broth is the sesame base, which is extremely rich in flavor, and is accentuated by the addition of spicy garlic oil (the beautifully decorative dark streak across the broth in the photos). Possibly because the broth is so forward, the default version of this dish does not include the egg or cha-shu (sliced pork) that are common to most of the other dishes. On my second visit, I chose to add them to the base. Since tasting this dish, I have not been able to get it off my mind for several days!\\n\\nGankara Miso Ramen - While they also offer a regular Miso ramen which I have not yet tried, this version is amped up to be quite spicy. It reminded me of a kimchi-like soup flavor, which I quite enjoyed. The flavor was so full that I had a hard time tasting the Tan Tan broth after a few bites of this. Apparently, the cucumber appetizer may be useful as a palate cleanser if you are tasting one broth after the other.\\n\\nGantetsu Shoyu Ramen - The term shoyu refers to the soy sauce base, which was definitely a simpler flavor compared to the two above, though still nice and meaty. Personally, I prefer the levels of complexity with sweetness and spiciness as in the previous two broths, though if I could prepare this one myself, I would certainly be proud of it. Compared to the \\"regular\\" Shoyu ramen, the Gantetsu Shoyu menu option seems to have a couple more default toppings (the sliced cha-shu pork, sauteed bean sprouts, and crunchy garlic) and skips others (diced onions, Iwa-nori).\\n\\nI have yet to taste the regular Miso or the Shio ramen. My best guess is that the Shio (\\"sea-salt\\") flavor may be the most subtle. I can theoretically imagine being in the mood for that, but I can't stop thinking about the Tan Tan. It seems I am doomed to only taste the others when I am with someone else to order a second bowl!"},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Kitchen","address":"425 Lynnway","city":"Lynn","stars":"3","text":"Everything we've tried was a hit.

The yellowfin crudo was lovely, but the fluke crudo was a table favorite. Who doesn't love sesame? Yummmmmm. As for the yellowfin, if you found the blood orange and soy sauce to be unpleasant, that's because you were eating grapefruit and black garlic... just had to point that out...\\n\\nThe roasted almond caesar was good. Looooooooooove bouquerones. I could eat those all day, and I liked the almond crunch in there.  The charred baby octopus was tender and delicious. I found the portion size surprisingly large; I feel like I had about a third of an octopus on my plate. No complaints there; I was in the middle of a food tour of Boston, so I may not have seriously brought my appetite to this place. \\n\\nThe service was great. Friendly and attentive, built some nice rapport. We recognized the GM from Menton, and she just seems to genuinely enjoy what she does and made sure our dining experience was wonderful. \\n\\nMy only real complaint was that I really had to sort of cobble together a pescetarian meal.

We did the Margherita (fresh mozzarella, diced Roma tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, garlic & basil), which was very tasty.  The perfect amount of sauce so that it wasn't overwhelming.

It's true, or at least I've convinced myself it's true because if I didn't, I'd be devouring doughnuts with alarming frequency. But even I knew I had to try Voodoo Doughnut because the buzz had been deafening me for years. Even the late, great Anthony Bourdain took notice of them on his previous travel show, 'No Reservations'. So when Jamie W. and I were walking west from the waterfront, we saw young people scurrying about with their signature pink boxes and knew we were close by.\\n\\nSure enough there were people at their outdoor tables wolfing down doughnuts, and as luck would have it, the permanent line to get them had an unusual break which we seized. I already told Jamie what we would order since I had been schooled on the must-haves by Voodoo aficionados back home. First up was the $3 Voodoo Doll, a raised yeast doughnut filled with raspberry jelly and covered liberally with a sweet chocolate frosting. It looked like the progeny of Mr. Bill's evil twin and Patrick the Starfish, Spongebob's best bud. We both took one bite each. Definitely softer than I expected. Next was the $3.50 Maple Bacon Bar.\\n\\nIt was another raised yeast doughnut but slathered with a maple frosting and topped with crisped bacon strips. Concept was somewhat better than the execution, but who turns down bacon? Again one bite each. Next was The Loop for $1.95, yet another raised yeast doughnut but this one dipped heavily in a thick vanilla frosting and topped with what appeared to be a bowlful of Fruit Loops. Even though it was Portland Pride weekend and they offered a Gay Bar, the multiple colors raised our freak flag most suitably. This one was actually better than it looked probably because that was my favorite cereal as a child. Nice and sweetly crunchy.\\n\\nBefore you ask, yes, they do offer a Capt'n Crunch version as well. Despite our praise, we stuck to our guns and stayed with one bite each. Last one was a concession to Jamie, the $1.15 Blueberry Cake doughnut which came with a thin glaze. It was clearly the most nondescript of the quartet we ordered, but since it was the only cake of the bunch, it was ironically the most satisfying. But no matter, it was one bite each. Here they are in the box (photo: http://bit.ly/2lAJt77). After taking our somewhat disciplined approach, I asked Jamie rather facetiously, \\"That was enough, right?\\". He nodded his head, and we left the remains in the box on top of the trash bin. It can be done.\\n\\nDOUGHNUTS - 4 stars...good quality overall though some were better than others...the less accessories on them, the better\\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...forcibly kitschy, tries a bit too hard, seating limited\\nSERVICE - 4 stars...better than expected considering the necessary assembly line approach\\nTOTAL - 4 stars....if you really need a doughnut fix, this is it...unless you're closer to The Doughnut Plant!"},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I wanted a quick bite to eat  on a late Tuesday night that we wouldn't feel guilty about.

The only downside that I would say this place has is that it's not the most price friendly for some individuals, however, neither is Nordstrom itself.  If you're a big burger fan, I would stay away from their burger but their flatbreads are really yummy.

A lot of folks were already waiting in the lobby area because they had parties of 10 or more.  So we were seated at a round table against the wall. Our server greeted us quickly and took our drink orders. After that he was the slowest! Another waiter came over and told us our server had an emergency and he would be taking over. He was absolutely great but the food was very blah. I got the baked chicken with dressing, sweet potato souffl√© and greens. My dad got the catfish, which they gave him 2 huge pieces, buttered peas, and macaroni and cheese. He said the catfish was great but the sides were not seasoned well.

On the recommendation of other Yelpers, hubs and I made it to this little hole in the wall around 6pm today (Sunday).  The door was locked, even though they were supposedly open till 8.  Then we noticed another glass door next to it, and inside there were some people who appeared to be eating.  So we went in there.  Six tables, and these four guys at one table, who looked like they might be related to the owners, had just been served something that looked delicious.  There was no one else in there.  We stood there for a bit, not sure what to do.  (Turned out the locked door was for the next room, which wasn't being used.)  Finally I asked one of the diners, \\"Um, do you know if they're still serving dinner?\\"  He said, \\"I think he'll be coming out again soon.\\"\\n\\nWell, so we waited another couple minutes, and sure enough, a fellow came out and said, \\"Can I help you?\\"  I said, \\"Are you still serving dinner?\\"  He looked unsure and then said apologetically, in very broken English, \\"We today have only goat, chicken, and spaghetti.\\"\\n\\nSo I pointed at the other table and said, \\"What they have looks good!\\"\\n\\nHe nodded, showed us a table, and went into the kitchen.  Before I could blink, he was back with a small, very fresh salad and a whole banana for each of us.  I asked for water and he gave us bottled water.  Within -- I kid not -- three minutes, he was back with two huge steaming plates of chicken over rice.  It was fantastic.\\n\\nWhen it came time to ask for the bill, he didn't seem to understand at first, but then I made a writing motion with my hand, and he said, \\"OK.  Twenty dollars.\\"  That was it.  Ten bucks a plate, and they didn't charge for the water, the salad, or the banana.  Unbelievably, they do take credit cards, and I did actually sign a regular-looking credit slip.\\n\\nAfter we left we stood outside for a bit looking at the pictures of the food they had posted.  There really were only three or four pictures.  The guy came out and told us that we should come back to try the goat because it really was the best thing they make, and also apologized that he wasn't able to give us the sambuka which is a fried thing that looks like a samosa, and asked us to come back to try it.\\n\\nBottom line: even though I never saw a menu or a bill, and it took a couple tries to get in the door, it was great, friendly, lightning-fast service and even better food, and incredibly cheap.

Not overwhelming, knowledgable. \\nDrinks - 4/5. Craft cocktails, great wine. \\nFood - 2/5. Let me explain...\\n\\nThe rolls were outstanding. Salty and buttery and served super hot. The sides were 50/50. The French fries may have been the best I ever had. They looked like McDonalds fries, perfectly salted and hints of Rosemary. Instead of popcorn at movies, from now on, I want a giant bag of these fries. The truffle asparagus was tasteless. The asparagus was cooked perfectly but there was no taste of truffle. The fianc√© said she could taste a slight hint, so I let her have my share as to me, they were tasteless. \\n\\nFor the steak I ordered a 28 day aged rib eye, medium rare. It was cold. Not just \\"not hot\\", or even room temperature - cold. I never send food back but I made an exception here. Though they did bring out my second steak quickly, which was hot, it was fairly chewy. I make rib eyes at home often, and the fat content of this cut typically allows it to melt in your mouth. Not here. Maybe this is because it was aged? To help relate it, order a medium steak at Applebee's and that's what this $44 steak reminded me of. However, the flavor was good. \\n\\nThe caramel creme br√ªl√©e was good, and the cappuccinos were great. Also, the wine prices were fair for this type of establishment. \\n\\nThough they did comp our dessert and bring us a complimentary dessert cocktail, I give Bancroft 3/5 stars. Really, it should be 2/5 as the most disappointing part of my meal were both of my steaks. However, great cocktails, phenomenal french fries, and great service made it 3/5. \\n\\nI'll likely continue to visit capital grille when I need a steak house fix.

By then ill probably hate technology anyway, IT'S THE DEVIL!\\n\\nRight then, on with my review....\\n\\nTop notch. My friend and I decided to try this place even after I protested many many times. You see, I'm a big fan of the good old American pile of deep-fried-everything-dripping-with-oh-so-delicious-gravy. So when I look for a breakfast place, I certainly don't usually stray from the norm on that one. However I have this inherent need to stay somewhat cultured--who knows why, I guess so I can be cool or whatever. Wait, it's so my wife will love me for being more than a self-loathing, steak hungry beast of a man. NAILED IT! \\nAnyways, my buddy and I set off walking. 23 blocks later we arrived. With feet numb from the cold, noses red and dripping, and relatively soaked from the rain, we arrived. We walk inside and are immediately greeted with a big smile and a cozy table. After doing some reading I realize we were lucky to have gotten a table so quickly.\\nThe server/manager that helped us was unbelievable. Coffee? Done. Smiles? Done. High fives? Done. This guy was ridiculous. He gathered that this was our first time here and brought us a tray of abelskivers on the house!  I ordered the Swedish meatballs with a potato pancake side. My friend, the apple fritters. \\nWhat happened next could only be described as a ballet of tiny little flavor pixies kissing each and every one of my taste buds at the same time.\\nYou know what else is great? This was just the right amount of food. Admittedly, when I eat \\"the American breakfast\\" I'm left with a stomach so full it hurts, and a body that needs to shut down in order to process it all. But this was juuuuuust right.\\nNo matter what you do, you simply MUST go to Broder. It will be ridiculously worthwhile for you. Take the lady on a date or something ya bum."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm clearly in the minority but I was far from impressed. Admittedly we arrived late-ish on a Sunday (10am) and waited for just under three hours for a fifteen minute meal. It's nice that they open up the bar next door, but for a party of two you just end up irritated. We waited one hour and at that point decided we might as well continue waiting. And then we waited another hour... I mean at that point, you've waited that long, right? We waited another 45 and were finally seated. They have nine 2-person tables and one larger 6-person table if I recall. We gave our order, which the waiter took to memory: daily scramble, salmon scramble, and the danish pancakes. The waiter came back five minutes later and asked again which sauces we wanted with the pancakes, to which my gf joked to me \\"if you can't remember it write it down.\\" Well, he should have because we never did get the pancakes. The gf loved her salmon scramble. I thought the blue cheese and sausage scramble was good, but nothing I'd ever wait more than 15 minutes for. I liked that it wasn't greasy and the blue cheese had good flavor, but the scramble overall was nothing you wouldn't expect at any quality breakfast spot."},{"name":"NaraDeva Thai Restaurant","address":"4696 Millenia Plz Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Food was ok. I wouldn't race back. Pick another Thai place if you wanna be wowed. Inside decor is definitely cool. Staff is friendly and helpful."},{"name":"Gobi Mongolian Grill","address":"14387 SE Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I really don't understand the appeal of this place.  I like the atmosphere and the place was clean and comfortable but the food was mediocre.  The website said there were make-your-own items plus hot ready made items.  The ready made items consisted of fried rice, orange chicken and spring rolls and that was it.  The orange chicken was lukewarm and was mostly breading.  Never having been in before, we were not sure how the preparation process worked but figured it out eventually no thanks to the waitress who gave a couple of rudimentary instructions and pointed to recipe cards at the end of the counter.  Meat and veggie selections were limited.  I suppose with practice one could figure out the sauce and spice combinations and end up with a delicious meal but I guess I just prefer the recipes to be figured out by someone who knows what they are doing rather than do it myself by trial and error. Personal preference."},{"name":"Rheinlander German Restaurant","address":"5035 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Selling to developers? Please don't!  \\nI have eaten at The Rheinlander with family and friends many times, most recently in January, 2016.  We have never failed to enjoy ourselves there.  It is a Portland landmark, and a true source of \\"comfort food\\" for those of us who love this restaurant. Based on what I've observed, the Rheinlander enjoys a plentiful and loyal clientele. \\nSome reviewers have complained about limited parking. It is true we rarely find a spot in the little parking lot along side Gustaf's; but come on, people, a second lot is available less than a block away.  Maybe if we all show our support, we can avoid losing this wonderful gem!"},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I normally not a yelp poster BUT today this placed changed my mind.  We flew in this afternoon and after check-in used the Yelp app for dinner assistance. My fellow Yelpers were on the money!  Great service,  amazing churrascaria aka rodizio.  I eat a lot of rodizio,  but this place by far takes the Newark NJ Ironbound sector for a run for its money.  Very few \\"fillers\\" for the beef eating enthusiast.  Reasonably priced for quality beef,  wine selection is rather small BUT well selected for the palates.  Enjoy!"},{"name":"Blitz Pearl","address":"110 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"geez, these reviews are all over the map!  I'm glad I went here BEFORE I read the reviews, cuz I'm glad we tried Blitz.   We had a couple hours to kill on a chilly Sunday afternoon before heading back to Seattle, so parked in Pearl District & walked around.  \\n\\nWe chose Blitz for a quick bite based upon the menu posted in the window, & the \\"pub\\" feel.  We sat & ordered upstairs before we figured out that downstairs was much more lively with pool players & beer drinkers enjoying a sunny chilly NW day. \\n\\nRose (?) our server was super-friendly & helpful with the menu; the turkey & avocado sandwich on 10-grain bread was delicious, the Tater Fries delivered the yummy goodness we expected.  The mac-n-cheese triangles were really tasty, yet I'd recommend to management to omit the mozzarella sticks that come with them & just gimme more mac-n-cheese bites! \\n\\nNext time beer & adult beverages (when I don't have a 3 hour drive ahead of me)."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Closest pizza to that in NYC.

We got in early today and decided to go becuase friends love it. No one was realy there so i dont know what it is like at busy hours.

From the moment I sat down, I could not help but look at all of the plates that were being delivered to the other tables. Everything looked so appealing and fresh. I started my meal with a tomato gazpacho that was refreshing and well balanced. My ricotta, fig, black pepper and agave tartine on whole wheat bread was one of the best things I have tasted in a long time. Served open-face and with a generous amount of ricotta, this tartine had a combination of flavors and textures like no other. It was creamy, sweet, savory, warm, and cool all at once. I could not stop eating it even when I realized I was full. The tartines are surprisingly big for their price tag. This particular one tasted as amazing as it was unique. \\n\\nThe prices are great, the portions are big, and the place itself is very cozy and appealing. The only reason why I did not give it a perfect five stars is because the hostess, who also appeared to be in charged of the place, was not very friendly. She appeared bothered by small things (i.e. a single person wanted to sit outside but could not because the table was a three-top; a lady came in with a car-sit that took up too much space in a corner of a the restaurant where nobody walks through, etc...). Aside from that, I truly enjoyed my first visit at the bistro. The delicious food, good prices, and lovely patio will keep you coming back regardless of the not-so-friendly service."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],R={key:0},j={key:1};function G(s,e,n,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",R,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const L=c(N,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-ff3cb6f3"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/24.md","filePath":"guide/24.md"}'),F={name:"guide/24.md"},Y=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{q as __pageData,Y as default};
