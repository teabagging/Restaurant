The cheese is Provel and if it isn't, then they mastered a replacement recipe. \\n\\n\\nFor the folks from ATX. The pies are personal sized, 10 inches in diameter. This style of pizza comes on a cracker like crust, not quite pizza chain thin crust but similar. The cheese is extra gooey which works with the cracker crust to make something greater than it's parts. This pizza is great bar food (the location is right next to a bar with a nice outdoor space) and can easily be shared with people because it is cut into the traditional square pieces. This isn't mozzarella on the pizza it's stretchier and gooeier with a hint of smoked provolone in it.

I had to circle the lot 2x to get parking and then I saw a line outside to get in and almost backed out the lot and left but I read somewhere that it goes fast. I'm thankful that I stayed. Kayla was the host outside. She gave us a menu and reviewed it with the first timers. The menu consisted of 2 sides. 1 side was the specialty menu and the other was the daily menu. She was very animated & knowledgeable. We stood in line for 10-15mins and then it was another short line at the order counter once we entered (5min wait). \\n\\n  It was \\"FAN FAVORITE WEEKEND\\" which is when they offer the most popular items on the specialty menu. I ordered the CRABBY BENEDICT (Biscuit Benedict stacked with lump crab cake, over medium egg( but I had mine cooked hard I don't like running eggs), roasted parmesan tomato, topped with hollandaise &cheddar chive grits on the side), a 7 platter(2 eggs, grits, garlic biscuit, & choice of a meat), &  & Peach Sangaria. \\n\\n  After ordering you have to find somewhere to sit in the cafe style dining area.

I typically enjoy southern-inspired food, but have had more misses than hits in Portland.  I think the thing that sets the Screen Door apart is that they are a southern-ish restaurant that still stays true to the Portland aesthetic and dedication to fresh, local ingredients.  \\n\\nWhen we first walked in, we had a bit of a wait (on a Tuesday night at 8??) and ordered some drinks.  The wine list was pretty uninspired, but there were decent beer selections (double mountain vaporizer!!) and a great special on a bottle of Abacela Albarino for $24.  Which was not only a great deal for that bottle(about 19. retail) but also was a great pairing for almost anything on their menu.  Once we were seated we were given some of the best service I've had in a while in Portland.  Our server was attentive and professional, but still fun and easygoing.  She was on top of our orders and requests, but never hovered.  In a town where seemingly half the population makes its living waiting tables, the service around these parts is never notable.  \\n\\nThe small sheet that accompanied our menu detailed a list of seasonal vegetable offerings that all sounded great.  My friend and I both decided to get the sides sampler and my husband and other friend got the fried chicken entree.  I chose a fried pork chop, mac and cheese, and peach & strawberry with goat cheese salad.  My friend also chose the salad, mac and cheese and some lovely gratineed summer squash.  \\n\\nWhen we received our food, I naturally dove into my mac and cheese (after lactaiding-it-up of course) and was blown away at how delicious it was.  It was well-seasoned, super cheesy and had a perfect crust brown cheese topping.  Probably the best home style mac I've had at a restaurant.  The pork chop was also well seasoned, light, crispy and not at all heavy.  The salad, though, was delightful.  The strawberries and peaches were so ripe they were candy.  When paired with the creamy goat cheese, peppery greens and acidity of the vinaigrette, it was summer on a plate.  The fried chicken was also very good.  Crispy, with a nice crust, it was great texturally, but could have have used a hare more seasoning.  The mashed potatoes on the plate were good, but boring, and the greens were tasty, but not as good as the ones at the Country Cat (amazing).  The bacon gravy was a great accompaniment.  \\nAll in all, I had a great experience there and would definitely go back.

From the CRAZY milkshakes to the quirky menu items, we really had a great time.  It's not the kind of place you'd go on a weekly basis, but for a special occasion, it's definitely worth it. \\n\\nThe Yelp check-in brought us a complimentary appetizer of the Mac and Cheese Balls, let me tell you. . .these were LEGIT.

Well, my luck changed when I saw this place, it had a sign that said something to the effect of, \\"Peruvian,... on the go,\\" or something like that right over the front door.  Surely some Latino food would be a good idea, no?\\n\\nSo I walk in, I didn't care for a loud, boisterous place, just wanted to eat my food in peace.  So I was lucky that there were only a few customers in at the time.  It was around 12:30 on Thursday, perhaps there should have been more customers because it was prime-time for lunch, but that point didn't fall upon me at the time.  Any rate, the place is set-up like a Chipotle-styled format, you get a bowl-style dish with various proteins, vegetables, salsas, etc.. However many of the ingredients are not what you get at Chipotle. \\n\\nWhile Pancheros and Chipotle brings to mind cuisine that is more like Mexican (burritos, tacos, etc..), those restaurants definitely retain a place in my stomach. But experiencing new things is a desire any food critic wants, right? (Even though I'm still waiting for my big break on Food Network...) But regardless, the serving format is merely one aspect of the restaurant and I was lucky to not have to deal with the downfalls of such a format (I have grilled those other places horribly because of their inability to adjust when the lines and situations become complex).  The primary difference was because it was NOT the same-ol' Chipotle cuisine, that is probably its best angle.  As far as a delicious meal is concerned, the place truly delivered.  \\n\\nI request a quinoa bowl with chicken, lentils, cucumbers, and their most spicy-est salsa (which was not 'salsa verde' or 'haba√±ero-whatever', I think huancaina?).  Without knowing what to expect from this mixture, I was well impressed!  The tastes were those that I have not experienced before (leading me to buy in to the authenticity of the Peruvian cuisine).  The ingredients were fresh, the tastes were very flavorful, and it was a much different culinary preparation.  The texture of the quinoa was different, but went well with everything.  The cucumbers were not just plain cucumbers, they were sliced and skinned and somehow prepared in a light oil, or vinaigrette solution (I am guessing).   The salsa on top had a somewhat, creamy taste to it, but it was spicy.  I don't think the Peruvians are known for spicy food like Central American Latino cuisines are.\\n\\nFor the rest of the restaurant, the tables and general areas were clean and organized, the serving areas with the food and behind the counter were also clean and organized.  The atmosphere and surroundings (as I mentioned) was cozy, not too busy or disorganized, but with a cozy and friendly style.  Decor was nice, but not fancy.  The music was also good, I think I recall them playing classical guitar or flamenco?? I was thinking that perhaps they would have been something more traditional, like Huayno or Criolla (as the restaurant)?  Any rate, the men's bathroom was clean and modeled well. (Good job! Many formal restaurants miss this one by a mile. UGH!) The serving staff was friendly, but I thought the price was a little high, I paid $10 for the entree.  The portion size was at least adequate to fill my appetite, despite being very hungry.\\n\\nSo I would definitely come back (if I'm in Columbus) and I would advise others who want a different taste to give this place a try.

Inside, they have several tables that can probably fit about 25-30 max.

The location is much smaller and while we were the only ones in line, it was kind of a weird set up. The area where you would stand to order is cramped and , if it was packed, it would back up into the dining area.  \\n\\nWe ordered the usual hummus trio for a starter. I ordered the veggie kabobs which came with a salad, pita bread and white beans. My husband had the grilled chicken pita with pasta salad. Normally we love the hummus trio but found that the red pepper hummus was rather thin and soupy and not it's usual thicker consistency. My husband took a bite of his chicken pita and a whole piece of chicken came out. He commented that whomever prepared didn't bother to take the time to slice the chicken into strips (like the SODO location) which is why a giant piece fell out. Not a big deal but those small details are noticeable for some as quality of menu items should be consistent from one location to another.   \\n\\nOverall, not a bad visit but the SODO location has an edge for us.

I can see how this place attracts large families. It's a reasonable deal too.\\n\\nI actually prefer Pieology over MOD. I think it's the dough for me. I thought the dough at MOD was really soggy. A few pros is that MOD has a ton more sauces and ingredient choices than Pieology however, Pieology was way better in the taste department, in my opinion. I love the whole idea of build your own pizza, choose ANY ingredient and as many as you want for no extra charge. They really have that aspect going for them.\\n\\nI'd come back.

Have fantasized ever since seeing Aaron's appearance in the movie Chef.Finally living in Austin, I had to try. I couldn't sleep the night before, tossed and turned awaiting the moment to wake up to get there silly early to be first, which I was. Arriving at 5:55 I took my spot and powered the kindle for a long morning. 6:25 the first couple came, a great couple visiting from San Francisco. Hour past hour, we compared foods tried, countries visited, our heritages. I honestly think Franklin's is more about the experience than exclusively the food in a vacuum. I got 1lb brisket (half fatty/ half flat with burnt tips), 1lb beef ribs, 1/2 lb Turkey and a link. The link, perfect pop when biting into, highly fatty so beware when you bite in or you will spray your neighbors. The Turkey, was good but is a uniformly pedestrian protein best left to November. The ribs were done perfectly enough to pick up the rib and the meat nearly slides off the bone. Now the brisket. Walking up to order station upon opening, first in the line they cut off the burnt ends presented a tray and instructed to enjoy and share to those behind who have waited the longest. Knee buckle good. Yes, that good. Never a fan of fatty end of brisket but getting because.....Franklin's. Still not hugely a fan as its simply fatty, without much bite. Lean end...perfectly seasoned, amazing smoke ring, cut uniformly 1/4 inch and surviving the pull test. Now for the caveat. Has Aaron Franklin taken the uniformly tough piece of protein and given it the respect to prepare it as perfectly as is possible? Absolutely. Without question. Team members working there, the best, most friendly in Austin without question. Absolutely perfect to be modeled elsewhere in Austin. Food for the price drive though, absolutely. The food for the price in a closet, maybe. The culture that has grown around the tailgating culture of a 3,4,5 hour wait, meeting new friends, enjoying beers and the anticipation similar to kickoff of a ticket holder experiencing Super Bowl, absolutely worth it. Without question. When friends come in to town would I suggest Franklins for the experience/food? Without question.

I've had outstandingly delicious and decent-but-not-standout, but never half-bad. It balances out for me to \\"they're always good, sometimes great, and the prices make the gamble worth it.\\"\\n\\nMy favorite so far has been the Hot Bollywood, the only premium dog that comes with a veggie option. I also loved the Tater Tot-chos (deluxe style) I got with a plain veggie brat (The Glenn Beck) once. The bratwurst and Polish sausage options are well worth trying in place of the ordinary dog, whether you're opting for meat or veg. They seem a bit more -- how to put it? -- substantial to me. And Frank's gives so many dog (eight choices: five meat and three veggie), bun (three choices, if you include the lettuce wrap), and preparation (three choices) options that you could experiment all day with different combos.\\n\\nNot sure whether it was me or the food or the day I ordered it on, but the Chicago dog wowed me less. I'd say the same of the Boston Baked Beans. I was ordering the beans vegan, though, which meant the only topping was onions (no cheese), and I took most of those off (not a raw onion fan). A cheesovore might find the beans a bit more... more.\\n\\nThe Fried Leeks are cool in theory but needed salt and sriracha in practice. As far as I'm concerned, if the needed supplements are within reach, this isn't necessarily a failing.\\n\\nService is usually friendly, sometimes to the point of bubbly. Whether she meant me to or not, the waitress who calls everyone \\"Behbeh\\" (seriously, not \\"baby\\" but \\"behbeh\\") had me giggling whenever she walked away. One busy Saturday night when I sat at the bar, the bartender spared moments to chat with me and the couple next to me -- and to get us talking to each other, which is an even smoother move.\\n\\nAnd goodness, the prices. I order one dog and one side when I go and have always either struggled to finish it or taken a bunch home, and still the only time I've had a bill over $10 is when I've ordered alcohol with my meal.

Food came out surging 2 minutes of ordering, that was my first scare. Like even chick fil a takes longer. Well it tasted like it came out in two minutes. It clearly was prepared hours before & warmed up in microwave. Very disgusting. I just can't understand how they have such great reviews. Perhaps I had the 1 off horrible experience. \\nWe ordered \\n- Steak, Chicken, Shrimp fajitas for 2 I think it's like $40\\n- guacamole appetizer -disgusting tasted like it was going bad. \\n- margarita with 1899 silver / very watery \\n- queso cheese dip- only ok thing\\n- calamari again not fresh, I didn't even bother eating it \\n- corn \\n- Nachos w/ steak - nothing worth mentioning \\n- quesadilla chicken- I didn't try after everything else was disappointment. \\n- salsa that's served is bland not good \\n- desert tres leches- Yuck, overly sweet, some weird gross taste. Eclipse de Luna & Whole Foods have way better tres lech \\n  So as far as the owner's response. I went on Friday May 3rd, it wasn't cinco de Mayo. And the restaurant was NOT full.

The line is always out the door and the food is great. I took a vacay day on a Friday and decided to (finally) come in here after so many had recommended it to me. FYI, the people waiting up front can be a-holes if you're in their way, and there aren't many places to stand unless you wait outside.\\n\\nCame by myself before 9am and was able to get a seat at the bar right away. I already knew what I wanted--chicken and waffles. One of the male bartenders took my order, but after waiting for over 20 mins, I had a feeling something was up. Especially considering how fast I saw them constantly bringing out chicken and waffles to others. I also saw the biscuits and gravy of the person next to me, and thought dipping the chicken in that gravy would be tasty, so I asked the bartender to add a side of gravy to my order.\\n\\nAbout 10 mins later, an order of biscuits and gravy was brought to me by a female server. Huh? I explained that I had just wanted a side of gravy with my chicken and asked about the status of my main chicken and waffles order. She looked confused, apologized and went over to the bartender to let him know he screwed up. Apparently, the bartender never submitted my order. She comped the biscuits and gravy to make up for the delay and error, which was nice, but the bartender never acknowledged the error or apologized. Thumbs up to the server, thumbs down to the bartender.\\n\\nFinally got my food about 30 mins later.

Tunes in the place are provided by Pandora unless somebody uses the digital jukebox on the wall, at which point it kicks those on, and according to the bartender shows you where your tunes are in the queue. No pool tables here tho, fyi. Not really space for it.\\n\\nI think the Kung Fu is a great idea and deserves 5 stars. I really should not knock it down a star just because during their peak times on weekends, much like Victor and Mark said in their reviews, the place is filled with way more unsavory folks than you'd wish were in there. In fact I almost but not quite wanna say there should be a dude at the door with a velvet rope, keeping out the kinds of people that ordinarily get whisked right into hoppin' places, and instEAD - letting in the other joes who probably know how badass the 8bit Bruce Lee on the outside of the joint is, and may also know, via emulators or age, how great it is to play your choice of 20 classic arcade games on the tabletop units where you can place your drink.

I love Roscoe and Sarah even more for waiting in line for 30-45 minutes while we were getting ready and getting lost on the way here. Our group of 6 came to the Screen Door around 12:30pm on Sunday and thanks to our lovely friends of friend who patiently waited in line much earlier, we were seated in less than 15 minutes! The place was loud... it's one big hall with tables squeezed together, leaving just enough room for the frenzied servers to navigate ever so skillfully through the maze of tables. \\n\\nOur server was funny, thoughtful and semi-attentive (he was super busy, I'll give him that). You can't really go wrong here, but if you're trying to decide between sweet or savory (one of the biggest decisions in life), I'd strongly recommend going with savory. I wanted to order the chicken and waffle, but I'm not a huge fan of waffle and THREE chicken breast seemed a little excessive (does that mean three chicken died for my meal?!). Instead, I opted for the chicken strips and the brioche vanilla bean french toast. Oh, I also forced James to split a side of bacon with me. \\n\\nFor $2.50, you get bottomless Stumptown coffee. This was actually not as good a deal as I thought, partly because they were so busy that they only swung by once to refill my coffee (and my water sat empty *pouts*... okay, I'm done whining, I swear!). The chicken strips ($6) came with a honey dipping sauce. No, not honey mustard, it's literally a small cup of honey, and that flavor combo actually worked! The chicken strips were AMAZING. Peppery, flavorful, juicy, crunchy, piping hot, all-white meat chicken, with just enough breading. The brioche vanilla bean french toast was a-OK. The presentation was great, but the french toast didn't really taste like vanilla and it was too doughy, not all the way done. The screen door bacon was thick and crispy, just the way I like it, but a bit over the top. I ended up scraping the pecan off of the last bacon strip because I firmly believe in leaving no bacon behind, but that praline pecan coating was overwhelmingly sweet and heavy toward the end of the meal. \\n\\nRoughly an hour or so later, we all waddled happily out of the Screen Door. It had been a while since I last overate this bad and all this pigging out only cost me $20 before tips.

The best drink I had here, by far, was the Avocado Margarita (which I wouldn't have picked if not for all the Yelpers who recommended it - thanks all!).  You have to try it at least once.  Probably the smoothest Margarita I've ever had.  The chips and salsa here are also pretty good; they will get those for you if you grab a table.  Only drawback to this place is that it is on the smaller side and as a result you may end up having to wait a while to get a table or may have to wait in line to get drinks.

It's like getting a poke bowl- light, refreshing and a little fatty from the fish. It's served with wonton chips and I think the combination is really good. We always run out of chips before dip though. \\nThe first time, my husband and I shared the Dion's OMG roll and the Firecracker roll, I thought I would like the OMG roll better because the sweet and savory combination, but it actually leans a bit toward the sweet side more. So I probably won't get that roll again, but the Firecracker roll was yummo! From my memory, it was a little spicy, but not too much. \\nThe second time we went there I opted to try a burger, and I wish that I had just stuck to sushi. I got the Black Truffle Cheese Burger and while everything sounded amazing on the burger I think it was just a little too heavy for me, on top of the black truffle cheese on the already greasy burger there is also a roasted garlic aioli, so it was just a bit greasy. It tasted good, but I think I just felt better after a meal of sushi rather than this burger.\\nI think the food here overall is pretty good, albeit a little overpriced, but what else would you expect being a theme park restaurant. \\n\\nThe atmosphere:\\nI love the interior of the restaurant, there are lots of cool little drawings all over the place accompanied by lots of bright and fun colors.

I debated the rest since everything on the menu looked so tasty! Our server recommended the Turkey Melt, but when he said that and I wasn't swayed, I went with the 1/4lb Reuben with corned beef, the Corndogula with pepper batter, and 1 order of tots for the table to share.   \\n\\nThe service was exceptionally friendly, taking the time to explain everything, including how the pepper batter is made when asked how spicy it is (not very, since the chili sauce that is mixed in is subdued by the frying).  \\n\\nThe milkshake was tasty and overflowing.  I loved that it was served in a Bell's Brewery Pint glass, adds to the aura of it not being your standard chocolate shake.  Mine was even overflowing.  I didn't stir mine, but should have, since I got most of the Mexican flavor (cumin, chili) in the bottom third.  Good shake.  Next time I'll try one of the shaketails (King Cake was featured for Mardi Gras).\\n\\nThe food came all together.  The corndog was great - crispy outer layer, soft inner layer, slightly spicy batter, 100% beef tasty dog, and one jalapeno on the end closest to your hand.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Pallookaville Mustard on top of most bites, loving the grainy real mustard texture.  The Reuben was good, too.

I will say that serving cheesey tots on paper isn't the best idea, as the cheese was very sticky and resulted in the tots falling apart since the cheese stuck to the paper and everything else.

I have been to this location before and have had excellent service but Denise has completely ruined any expectation that I have for your restaurant, and quite possibly any chance of myself or my friends going back there any time soon.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at your restaurant we sat down and waited approximately 10 to 15 minutes before our server came over to great us. When she did she took our drink order and disappeared for another 10 minutes. By the time she had come back we decided that we wanted an appetizer before our meal, we placed that and I asked if we could have breadsticks as well. Denise informed me that she \\"Could not\\" bring out breadsticks until I placed my entree order. Not knowing what I wanted yet, but knowing that I was definitely going to get something I again asked if it was any way that we could get some breadsticks. Denise said \\"No.\\" that she wasn't allowed to do that and walked away. I thought that was pretty rude. Five minutes later Denise comes back with some breadsticks for the table and says \\"I didn't want you to cry like a little school girl so I got your breadsticks.\\" Excuse me?! What gives you the right to say that, at this point I figure there goes any chance of a tip for her. We place our orders for entrees at this time and still no appetizers.\\n\\nAfter waiting 10 more minutes or so our appetizers finally come out and then 5 minutes later our meals come out as well, completely ruining the point of our appetizers and making all of us feel rushed. We also wanted to place a to go order for someone that wasn't with us. We told Denise and she said that she would be right back to take that order, disappeared and never came back. I noticed that the table beside us had the same type of horrible service as well.\\n\\nAfter being fed up with the lack of service, I excused myself and went up to the hostess stand and asked to speak with the manager. I just wanted him to know that the service was off that night and that it wasn't the best visit I have had. When I arrived back at my table I noticed that the other tables guest were complain to Denise about the service level and she said, clear as day \\"I know, I know... he already complained to the management.\\" and pointed directly at me. So now she has not only embarrassed me in front of my own table, but another table and anyone that was with in an earshot of her as well. At this point I just asked to get the check, excused myself again and went to the manager and stated that Denise was quite rude and that I would not be returning to your establishment until they can treat there customers with respect.\\n\\nDenise saw me speaking with the manager and continued to refuse to pick up the check from the other members of my party.

I couldn't believe how rude they were to not give us a break and let us order dinner. (My bad, I guess we WERE 4 whole minutes late.) We ordered our small plates/tapas and ate quickly while they basically cleaned and closed the place around us and the 15 other people eating/drinking in the bar area. One server even came and cleared away the candles next to us on the bar AS we were eating. I felt completely embarrassed to have brought my guest to Masa tonight....especially seeing as I live in the neighborhood and eat there almost once/week! I guess business must be booming at Masa, because clearly they didn't need or want our business tonight.

My brother's egg yolk was a rich vibrant yellow and complemented the texture/ flavors of the Andouille sausage biscuit perfectly. I do think our 3rd friend made the best choice tho - that Okra and the black-eyed beans mash smelt and tasted heavenly.

Sitting up on the corner of Killingsworth and Beast, this unassuming, airy little space is packing a pretty large punch. From the apertifs to the cocktails to the small plates and all the way through to dessert, the execution is solid, reaching to sublime. \\n\\nThe menu starts off at Happy Hour with some small plates and a nice menu of vermouths and other similar apertifs like Cocchi, Dolin, Lillet and similar ($5). From there the cocktail menu is divided into thirds - before, during, and after - with flavor profiles to meet each segment of your dining experience. The flavors range from bright, bitter drinks that pop (before) to more balanced, nuanced cocktails that pair well with food (Martinez, sidecar, etc) to strong, palate-clearing boozy after dinner libations. Everything is mixed with a careful hand and strong attention to detail. These drinks are thoroughly enjoyable. \\n\\nFor comestibles, the menu ranges from small to large plates, with a few teetering at 'medium' size. On my first visit, I noted that even the large plates seemed to trend toward medium (at least in size) but on my last visit I was reassured by the portion size of the 'large' plates - plenty of food going on here. This is one of those menus that makes you want to order everything on it to share with the table. \\n\\nThe small plates start with items such as bread with compound butter (ours was a tomato ni√ßoise), steamed artichoke hearts with cured lemon and a sort of remoulade, strawberry and cheese salad with almond brittle, succulent lamb short ribs with a bean and onion salad, pate, pork belly with egg... the list goes on. Had I stolen a menu I'd be able to report more. Everything we had (the strawberry salad, the lamb, the bread, the artichokes) were fantastic. \\n\\nFor mains, they offer a short but sweet selection of items, with the signature dish being the poulet en cocotten ($25). Everything else on the large plate side of the menu was around $15-$18, but I'm not sure how much the specials like salmon run. Other large plates are the pork tenderloin with grits and cherries, truffled potatoes with an egg, market vegetable fricas√©e and a couple more. We sampled the 3 listed in the last sentence as well as the namesake poulet. All were fantastic, with the two standouts being the poulet and the potatoes. \\n\\nMy dish was the poulet, so I feel like I made the right choice. Served in a tureen, this milk-fed chicken was one of the most tender and flavorful I have ever consumed. Seriously. Usually chicken is a garbage dish at most restaurants - on the menu because it needs to be. Not here. This dish could easily be shared by two people, especially if you got a starter dish. The size is huge, the meat is cooked to a succulent perfection, and the flavors are light, but contain much complexity and depth. This is an absolutely fabulous dish. And most at the table agreed. \\n\\nFor dessert, we went with a special - the peanut butter cheesecake semifreddo with caramel and whipped cream - along with a lemon cake with blueberry compote. The peanut butter dish was decadent... insanely rich with a delicious caramel on top. It was worthy of numerous eye-rolls. The lemon cake didn't disappoint, and provided a light but delicious alternative to the heavy cheesecake. While I didn't partake of a post-prandial libation, the menu of digestifs is intriguing and alluring. \\n\\nOur meal took 3 hours - by our own design. We could have been out quickly had we wanted, but the point was to eat and enjoy - dinner was the destination. We ordered at a leisurely pace and enjoyed the bright, open front section of the space, which has a wall of doors that open up in the hot weather to create a nice, open-air sidewalk setting. A great casual place to dine. With good company, you can make a great meal last as long as it should. \\n\\nAt $50 (before tip) per person we enjoyed 4 apps, 4 entrees, a bottle of white, 3 cocktails, 4 glasses of bubbly and 2 desserts. That, my friends, is not bad for the quality of meal. \\n\\nI will definitely be back to Cocotte, especially with anyone I can find who wants to split half of a divine milk-fed chicken with me."},{"name":"Art Bar","address":"40 Edwin H Land Blvd","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I feel like this place is underrated.\\n\\nFantastic views of the water and city line.

Small spot with outside seating. I had a full slab of pork ribs. Meat was tender and moist and that perfect bite off the bone not overly cooked. The sauce had the right tanginess and complimented the meat. Way better than Phil's BBQ back home. We had the collard greens, potato salad and beans which were all very tasty also. Satisfied!

We arrived around 7AM and there was already quite a long line that had formed. At first, it smelled like dumpster where we were waiting, so that was a bit unpleasant but later this wasn't as bad when we got closer to the building. They say to treat the line like a tailgate which is some good advice because it is a long wait. Bring portable chargers, drinks, sunblock.  One nice thing is that they have chairs and umbrellas avaibable for use, but there may not be enough if you're far back in the line. Once they open, they allow people in to use the restroom and grab water, so don't worry too much about that. The people in front of us in line were nice to talk to, but the people behind us was a large family with lots of screaming children, which began to get annoying after a few hours. We finally got our food around 1:30PM which is actually what they had predicted for us based on where we were in line. It was alright, but I wouldn't necessarily say it was spectacular. The fatty part of the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth, but in my opinion the seasoning was way too strong and salty on the outside. The barbecue sauces they had to choose from were alright: they had a traditional sweet Texas sauce, a carolina vinegar sauce, and their special espresso sauce made with real coffee, which to me had an almost Asian flavor. The rest of the meats were good, but I wouldn't say they were the best I've ever had and probably not worth a 6.5 hour wait. The potato salad was way to vinegar tasting for me, and the bread was just plain wonderbread so nothing spectacular. The sweet tea was probably my favorite part of the meal. After we ate, we asked to take a tour of the smoke room, and the people who usually give tours were busy but the hostess was very nice and gave us one which was really interesting.

When a place like Screen Door commands locals and visitor's attention alike, you know you are in for a treat. \\n\\nThe menu here encapsulates what makes Portland an Eating Destination: Take a bunch of classic favorites (fried chicken, gumbo, mac n cheese), do clever iterations of that cuisine (fried pork belly with seared scallops on a bed of grits? YES PLEASE!) and add a quality helping of up to the minute locally sourced veggie dishes on the fresh sheet (beet salad, apple slaw, etc). All for plates under $20. Need I say more? \\n\\nWell, you have to know the caveats: it's busy. Some people find the service lacking (I've never had a bad server).

However for $6.25/designer burger, this place easily surpasses the typical fast food burger you'd get for the same price. I'd previously only been here with my gf for drunk munches, but this time we stopped by nursing some serious hangovers (alcohol did not relieve the pain of a Titans beat down in the divisional playoffs) so a review finally seemed appropriate.\\n\\nMy gf ordered the mama cheeseburger (fried pickles and onions, jalape√±os, and bbq sauce), while I settled on the bbq onion cheeseburger with an add-on egg. We both agreed that the fried onions (and pickles in her case) were so salty that it burned the roofs of our mouths, and honestly kind of ruined the burgers for both of us. My gf typically gets the big tasty burger (standard cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and onion), which doesn't leave you feeling the same level of discomfort so I'll just recommend avoiding the fried toppings. Otherwise our burgers were solid, just know that the \\"saut√©ed onions\\" on the bbq onion burger are about on par with straining a can of French onion soup.

It was awsome, I don't need to use the knife, the Kurobota pork separate almost by itself and melt perfectly in my mouth and cost a very reasonable $21.  Given this level of performance and establishment, they can easily charge the same dish at $29 or $32.   I am going to have to find time to come back again on my next trip.

The serving is small-ish, but wow, the taste packs a surprising punch. Not oily, a savoury aioli, and the winning ingredient: pickled shallots.

I noticed brussel sprouts as an accompaniment to the short rib entree, so I requested that as a side, which they were happy to provide.\\nThe burger is CRAZY good. I was starving, which helped, but I loved everything about it. I had mine without alfalfa, but the bun was soft and dense, and the burger was bursting with flavour.

Some of the wait staff were friendly, I'll give them that; but other staff had a snobbish vibe.

Next time an establishment wants to sell a store-bought pizza and reheat it maybe you should just not order it and put it on your menu. The crust was the worst I have ever had. They threw cheese in the center of the pizza that just melted in a glob. We ended up sliding the topping off of all the slices just to have something to eat before we got on the plane.

As you look for the place, look for a house and you'll find a fairly large parking lot in the back. Yes, the restaurant overtakes a house, which is a nice way to establish that homey southern setting. Really nicely decorated on the inside with seating provided on the upper level of the restaurant as well as outside on the patio. There isn't a prominent waiting area so it was a little awkward standing on the side as we were waiting to get seated. \\n\\nWe started off with some cocktails: \\nCountry Thyme Lemonade which came with Absolut Citron, thyme-infused syrup, and fresh lemon juice. A very refreshing good cocktail. Definitely a good summer drink.\\n\\nSalty Dogwood which came with O4W Vodka, Orpheus Atalanta tart plum saison, grapefruit, and pink peppercorn. If you're not a huge fan of grapefruit, I would advise you not to get it. It was a little too much for my liking but still refreshing. \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night but food was slightly a little disappointing. We started off with George Bank's Scallops as our appetizer. This was probably the most disappointing thing to grace our table. I'm all for fine dining, but wow... This dish came with 3 tiny scallops garnished with celery root, shaved fennel, and grapefruit-tarragon vinaigrette. So size isn't everything and I was hoping it would at least taste good... but unfortunately no. Very dissatisfied. \\n\\nFor entrees we got the Buttermilk Fried Springer Mountain Farms Chicken and the market fish: \\nFor the Fried Chicken, it came with garlic collards, smashed red bliss potatoes, and honey-thyme jus. If you're not familiar with Springer Mountain Farm, it's a family owned business that produces 100% natural chicken. I've had Springer Mountain Chicken before and it did not disappoint this time around either. The chicken was cooked really well - tender and juicy on the insider with the fried battered crunch on the outside. \\n\\nI can't quite recall what the market fish was... but I know it wasn't my favorite dish. The fish didn't has as much flavor as I would have liked. The grilled lemon on the side did help bring out more to the flavors when I squeezed the juice on it and added more salt and pepper. It came with saut√©ed asparagus, fennel, butterbean, and they used a lemon sauce instead of the saffron-tomato broth due to my allergies. \\n\\nOverall, service was good. Our server did a great job accommodating us and my allergies. Food was average and appetizer was a disappointment. There wasn't a hugeee wow factor that would merit this place for a quick return - although the vibe and scene of the place was really pleasant.

No pocketless, dry, crumbling, burrito-style sandwiches here: this is the real deal. I've heard they get them shipped from somewhere else but I don't really care. I miss Israeli style pitas so much sometimes (and by \\"sometimes\\" I mean every time I eat a falafel sandwich in one of their competitors' pitas), these can really make my day.\\n\\nThe texture of the falafels is perfect, although I will admit that there's a subtle flavor difference between these and what I'm used to. Still, considering everything else, it's hardly reason to deduct a star. The vegetables are super fresh, the hummus is good, and everyone's happy. A note about the delicious green spicy stuff, aka skhug: unless you handle heat very well, I would ask for it on the side. Yes, it will make your sandwich all that much better, but if you're like me, only in moderation.  \\n\\nIf you go during the lunch rush, it gets super crowded and there isn't really any room to sit. And yes, it is expensive, but I think a lot of the folks complaining about the prices don't realize just how much money it costs to operate a Glatt Kosher restaurant in Boston. \\n\\nIf you manage to go during off-peak hours, the staff is very nice and the atmosphere is fun and happy.

My kids loved it and in keeping with the theme pretended it was the sickbed.\\n\\nWe rolled in at dusk on a Friday night and the scene was beyond surreal - the halls were bustling with activity, the lights dim while undertaking the maze to the front desk, people carrying microbrew around with old-school (literally) water fountains around. So surreal - I'd say dreamlike but I wasn't only in my underwear thank goodness.

The Yelp waitlist feature is great as the wait on Sunday is well over an hour for a table of 4.\\nWhen I was seated I was impressed by their menu selection, there were just so many things I wanted to try. This is where things started going downhill. My friend ordered a breakfast poutine and the server condescendingly asked whether she knew what a poutine was as \\"her last 3 tables didn't know\\". When I ordered my dish, I asked for my eggs soft poached and the server triple checked with me that I knew what that meant. Not only that but the server did not ask if we wanted water which is pretty much a default these days as soon as diners are seated.\\n \\nIn total we ordered 4 different entrees: Get Shorty Rib Poutine, Croque Madame, Duck Leg & Waffle, and The Notorious B.I.T. (Loved the naming of these dishes by the way, very Bob's Burgers.). The entrees were OK for the most part, especially given the fact that they were all $20 or less. Nothing really stood out as amazing and the Duck Leg & Waffle was very awkwardly presented off to one side and confusingly doused with caramel drizzle over a brown plate. Nothing we ordered really smashed it out of the park and the naming is far more creative than the actual execution of any of these dishes. Perhaps that's why no one came to check on how we were liking our dishes.\\n\\nI can easily name 10 places in Vancouver's brunch scene that do a far better job in food quality and probably 100 better ones in terms of service. I think the staff here might be jaded by all the tourists they deal with that are unfamiliar with the cuisine and likely poor tippers, so the service was just a thorough letdown.

Despite this, we were able to get seated immediately which was awesome. We weren't seated in the best location since the carts didn't quite push into our area, so we had a bit of difficulty getting food. It ended up being us having to walk around to fetch our own food which wasn't a huge deal. My friend dines here a lot more often then I do and he said that this was pretty atypical and we just got unlucky.\\n\\nWe got all the classic dim sum dishes, although I thought it was interesting how they seemed to do all the traditional dishes just a little differently. For example, their shrimp dumplings had little pieces of bamboo in it which I wasn't a huge fan of. Their pai gu, or short ribs were really good though, although interestingly, they were put on a bed of rolled rice noodles which was a combo that I haven't seen before. Their shu mai were on point though, as were their xia chang feng which I loved. I think we got the above dishes plus some pork buns--total came out to be $20 which was pretty respectable for two people.\\n\\nAll the food was super delicious, and despite how many people were in the restaurants, I was impressed at how efficient and on-top-of-their-game the waiters were in terms of clearing plates, helping us get food, and getting our final check sorted out.\\n\\ntldr; Hei La Moon very much has the dim sum game down. With yummy food and cheap prices, how could one not like this place? My only qualm was that I wish the carts were a bit more efficient so you could actually get your food--I think our experience would have been really difficult for anyone who didn't already know what they wanted to order--it was good that we've both had dim sum before since we didn't need to see our options."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you haven't been here, then you haven't lived.\\nA bold (yet true) well-deserved statement about Screen Door.

A \\"must do\\" on our list during a recent trip to Austin, my friends and I ventured here on our first full day. Because it was a rainy Friday morning and figuring most people would either be at work or not stand in the rain to wait for barbeque, we thought we would be safe to show up and get in line at 9:30am. Boy, were we wrong! Even in the rain, having to hold umbrellas in the gravel parking lot, the line of people was wrapped around the street. We were lucky enough to snag the last parking spot in the lot and our journey began from there. There are several great things about Franklin and his staff. They promote a very friendly atmosphere, even as you wait. There's folding chairs to sit on while you wait outside, staff members walked around handing out umbrellas several times, and a gentleman walked around asking for our orders to make sure they had enough food to meet demand. The other thing to note about this place is they have their wait down to a science--and they will likely be right, regardless of your optimistic hopes.\\n\\nAfter standing in line for about 1.5 hours, a staffer assured us the line would move drastically after the doors opened, and it did! He then told us what our individual wait times would be based on where we were standing in line, and it was accurate and with an obvious precision of someone who does this every day.\\n\\nA fun five hours later, and we were finally at the counter. The beauty of Franklin and their methodical system allows them to time their service to a tee: they ask that you not reserve a table until you receive your food, and they only serve one order at a time, similar to an assembly line. Combined, these practices allow for seats to be empty as patrons are ready to sit down, and takes away from a potential bottleneck once impatient patrons reach the counter. Every order is prepared individually to ensure proper service and to also make sure you receive exactly what you ordered.\\n\\nMy friends and I spared no chances; we decided to try most everything:\\n\\n* Fatty brisket\\n* Lean brisket\\n* Turkey\\n* Sausage\\n* Ribs\\n* Coleslaw\\n* Potato salad\\n\\nMy absolute favorite were the ribs--simply phenomenal. The brisket, both fatty and lean, were a close second and also very heavenly. I loved the turkey as well, but I could do without the sausage or sides. All of the meat we ordered was so tender and seasoned so deliciously that half our table decided to skip the sauce and eat the meat itself.

No problem, since mistakes always happen. But instead of just taking back the dish, he accused my friend of saying odentang instead of boodae jungol even though they sound nothing alike, and she had even pointed to the boodae jungol on the menu when she ordered. He wanted us to keep the dish and then reorder the army stew. After debating and arguing with the server for quite some time, which I've never experienced before in any dining experience, he took back the odentang to the kitchen. I mean, I feel bad that the the dish was probably docked from his paycheck, but none of us wanted to eat the odentang and pay for something we clearly did not order after he already put a damper on our night. Lesson learned by both sides to double check orders...\\n\\nAlso, on a visit after that, a server told us that each person had to order a minimum of $20 worth of food per person to stay at our table, which is kind of ridiculous.

It's known for the chicken and waffles, but I'm not much of a waffle person so I ordered the fried oyster benedict. Fried oysters were amazing! Very fresh and flavorful. The eggs were covered in hollandaise, which was good at first bite but became a bit too much after the second. Grits were good though! Very rich. For those that want to follow the hype and get chicken and waffles, do it. I tried some of my friend's fried chicken and was surprised at how good it was. Crispy outside but tender and juicy inside.

Hardly dressy casual on the outside but definitely not trashy or looking like a bum. Nevertheless I was met at the door by an older man who walked up very close (as in, inside your private space bubble close), with arms crossed and a voice tone that challenged me to be in his restaurant. WTF? Fortunately I was part of a reservation.\\nNever have I felt this sort of turn-you-away-at-the-door \\"welcome\\" before anywhere, even in Vancouver, though I've seen it happen to my very casually dressed friend at Jules Bistro in Gastown.\\n\\nMy friend convinced me to try their Burgundy Beef Fondue claiming that the amount of meat was way more than pictured online. It is $36 online but $38 in the restaurant and you must have a minimum 2-person order.\\nI haven't felt so ripped off on meat since Wildebeest's tiny meat portion on their supposed 32-oz ribeye for $93. The portion of meat in the picture online (and in my pictures) is for TWO PERSONS. Yes, that small bowl of meat is $76.\\n\\nThey give you a lot of mayo in five flavours, which you could spend on the potatoes and bread. If you insist on throwing your money away at this restaurant, keep asking for bread and potatoes to fill you up and use up the mayo. We weren't charged for extra potatoes and bread but we had to ask. Make sure you stop before they actually charge you money for cheap carb filler on top of your $78.\\nTIP: Go to the Keg and get your meat there instead.\\n\\nAs for beef in a wine fondue -- Waste of time. It comes out of the fondue pot more or less tasting like beef. Also the small chunks of beef cook pretty fast, so don't leave your beef in there forever or it'll be pretty tough when it comes out.\\n\\nFor dessert we tried two smallish slices of their pies ($9 each) -- pear and almond; and lemon. Both were decent, but not at $9. Sorry. Maybe $8 if you are in Yaletown. Which you are not. More like $6 at the most given the size.\\n\\nThey also have Crepe Suzette ($10) swimming in sauce and melted ice cream but no fire at the table.

It was freezing cold and I should have brought my full winter attire much less a blanket, but I'm an idiot.  At least other people around me were cold too.  I decided to tough it out and grabbed a chair.\\n\\nThe staff was present in the morning, taking an approximate count of what we were going to order and selling drinks to the people who wanted it.  They were really friendly and were grateful that we were waiting in line.  Speaking of the line, no one else joined me until 9am.  From 9am to 10am, more people started coming in.  The line was long and extended through the parking lot at about 10am on this weekday.  I would say it's safe to come between 9-10am.  People in the line were pretty friendly and open to conversation.  Those were the smart ones, unlike the people freezing.  Restrooms were located in the parking lot and inside.  The warmth of the venue was a great excuse to use the bathroom before plunging back into the frozen tundra.\\n\\nDoors finally opened at 11am.  The ordering went pretty quickly.  I ordered 1/2 lb of fatty brisket and 1/4 lean brisket, 1 lb ribs, 1 sausage, side of beans, a side of coleslaw, and a banana bourbon pie.  The meat were was not as soft as other BBQ venues, but it was still tasty.  It was a little more dry than I was use to.  The brisket was good, but not great as I may have gotten bad end pieces.  The sausage was alright and the pork ribs were good, not as soft, but still tasty.  The sides were good and the meat went well with the white bread.  I took the leftover ribs and the banana bourbon pie home.  I ate the banana bourbon pie later and it was delicious.  You could taste banana and bourbon at the same time.\\n\\nI wouldn't mind eating at Franklin's again, but I wouldn't wait that long again and in the cold.  Like the veterans, I would come 1-2 hours before on a weekday and still get good food minus the wait.

The crab meat was fresh and not dry and tasted amazing with ghe mushrooms.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was a bit meh because it had too much bacon chips inside. The bacon overpowered the flavor and you barely got any clams. I had more potato and bacon than clam chowder.\\n\\nThe crab cakes were actually very juicy and not too dry. However they were very brittle because they kept breaking up. The breading though did need some sort of seasoning on them because once the tar tar sauce ran out it was a bit too bready.\\n\\nThe crab shrimp stuffed halibut with blue cheese was amazing. I enjoyed the mixture of flavors and the creamyness of the melted stuffing. The fish was not overcooked and cooked to perfection and every bite came with a burst of flavor. I ended up mixing the mashed potatoes into the mix just to use up any leftover creamy filling that was on my plate.\\n\\nThe chocolate bag was a bit too much. Some of the berries were very sour while others were a bit too bitter. I am guessing it was because of the season. The chcolate bag is made out of dark chocolate but it would have been better to fill it with ice cream rather than cream. The cream was too much and we ended up just eating the berries and breaking off the chocolate bits. The bottom of the bag is basically a large chocolate bar because of how thick it is.

The wings were OK but not terrible. After our meal, the server (Antonio or Anthony I believe)sat with us for a bit and talked to us about the desserts offered. When he talked about the bread pudding, we knew we had to order it. The dessert came out and the server was nice enough to top it with a candle and sang to me. When we bit into the bread pudding, it had a bourbon type of sauce that was amazingggg and just honestly delicious.

It was exactly what I wanted for a Father's Day dinner for my father in law, who loved the menu. \\nUpon arrival, we were seated in a booth, which was comfortable yet uncomfortable at the same time. It definitely felt more like a 'lounge with a drink' type of booth, rather than 'enjoy a three course meal where you have to reach across the table while sinking in.' Nonetheless, it didn't bother me too much, but worth noting in case you are short like me. \\nWe ordered the wild game fettine trio to start, and while all delicious, the buck fettine was by far my favorite. \\nFor the first course, as a table we ordered by the piece, and our server was so incredibly kind to accommodate the one person with food allergies at our table. We ordered the rabbit-rattlesnake sausage, hamachi tostadas, hot quail legs, and the snapper ceviche. All of it was great, but the rabbit-rattlesnake sausage was the clear winner. \\nMy husband ordered the bowl of Texas Red as a second course, which he really enjoyed. It was a very hearty flavor. If you order this, eat it with the cheddar jalapeno cornbread. That stuff was tasty. \\nFor the main course, I ordered the antelope short rib, a few others ordered some steak, and my husband and father in law ordered the rabbit ravioli. While my father in law loved the ravioli, my husband did not enjoy it. \\nOne other member of our table thought their steak was too dry, and my entree was rather subpar compared to some of the other flavors we had earlier in the meal. \\nI also want to note, there is a side dish called 'LD mac and cheese' -- it is not mac and cheese. It is an cheesy orzo pasta. While it tasted good, I was a little disappointed there was no \\"mac\\" in the mac and cheese. \\nThroughout the meal we ordered a few cocktails from the menu. The bluebonnet was fantastic, as well as their classic 'The Willie' which is served to you smoking. Great presentation! \\nOverall, the experience Lonesome Dove provides is a fun one. I enjoyed quality time with my family in a fun and new atmosphere. However, the food was lacking. The dishes, while fresh and innovative, did not impress me as far as flavor goes. It seemed that it was hit or miss depending on what dish you ordered. \\nI'd be more than happy to return to Lonesome Dove and enjoy more cocktails, wild game fettine, and maybe a few more first course plates, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to do a full dinner. \\nIf you visit, come with an open mind, it's a really fun place!

I only had a chance to try the vegetable spring rolls appetizer but they were pretty great and good sized (the appetizer comes with 3 hefty sized spring rolls with delicious Vietnamese dipping sauce), as well as the calamari. \\n- Good drinks. I had quite a few and honestly I don't remember the names, one was the Christini though- that was delicious. Another was white grape juice & vodka, and another was pineapple infused vodka. All were made really well \\n- Fairly good waiter. He was nice and attentive and made us feel welcome \\n\\n\\n\\nThat all sounds great, right? Why oh why would I give this place only 2 stars? Because of the attitude, that's why. Namely the attitude of the hostess. Considering she was the first person I spoke to when walking in, it put a damper on the rest of the atmosphere of the place. I walked in, the dining room had plenty of space open and I told the hostess I'd like a table for 3- as we were celebrating my friend's birthday and she and my other friend were still on their way. Her response?: \\n\\n\\"Well if they're not here yet, just have a seat and I can seat you when they get here\\". Great. You can't seat me now so I can sip on some water and perhaps order a drink in the meantime? (Granted, there was a bar too but seriously- wtf?) So I sat on the couch and waited. My friend the birthday girl showed up soon thereafter and we walked up to the hostess again asking to be seated. She told us to go downstairs to check out the wineroom as we'd \\"Probably like it better\\" (in a very condescending way, like we're not good enough to be upstairs??) we obliged and alas the wine room, though cozy looking, was full of people and so we walked right back upstairs. \\n\\nShe completely ignored us! We eventually found another hostess (who, by the way she was dressed, was probably actually one of the chefs), who was similarly rude to us and seemed to be put off that we wanted to be seated. \\n\\nUgh seriously this place is not that great to have such a snobby attitude.

I would come back just for the wings.  The plates were served with 2 sides, we chose the pinto beans and sweet potato fries. The brisket was the second best menu option. It is a fatty brisket cut, which just melts in your mouth, and full of great flavor.  The BBQ sauce falls flat next to the meat, and is almost better without it.  The sauce to me was nothing special.  The sweet potato fries were OK, and the pinto beans were full of smoky flavor, and I actually liked them, which says a lot.

I was surprised to see maybe 50-75 people in front of me.  Reading other reviews and from talking to other people, I was expecting a lot worse.  It was an overcast and potential rainy day coupled with being mid week and I suspect that played a big role in the smaller crowd.  Most of the people in front of me were sitting in lawn chairs.

While we were waiting, a Franklin employee walked down the line to find out what we were ordering. He wasn't taking orders, he was just getting an idea of what people were ordering and he let us know that everything we wanted to order would still be available.  Right before 11 am, it started to sprinkle. Fortunately I had an umbrella but I did observe a Franklin employee walking down the line and handing out umbrellas to anyone that didn't have one.  Although there weren't enough to provide for everyone in line, I thought it was considerate that they even had chairs and umbrellas for their customers.  I think many establishments wouldn't have this due to fear of things getting stolen  Especially since some of the umbrellas had the Franklin branding on them which would make them a big target to be someone's souvenir.  \\n\\nOnce the place opened, it took me until 12:30 to get up to the counter.  It wasn't a bad wait.  It seems like everyone around me was from all over the country or world and it made for great conversation.  Once I got to the counter I ordered a little bit of everything.  Brisket, pulled pork, sausage, pork rib, turkey and potato salad were all ordered.  \\n\\nThe seating outside was small but it seemed like tables were getting churned over quickly.  I quickly sat down and started to sample everything.  I started off with the turkey because that's my least favorite protein that I ordered.  I actually wasn't impressed.  I thought it was dry and I feared this place was not going to live up to the hype.  After this I tried the brisket and I absolutely loved it.   I had both lean and moist.  I'm a big moist brisket fan and it was really marbled and had so much flavor. I usually stay away from lean but tried it and it was really flavorful.  I may have actually liked the lean more than the moist side.  The pork rib and pulled pork were also really good.  At the counter they drizzled some type of bbq sauce on the pulled pork that really gave it an incredible flavor.  For my final protein I tried their homemade sausage and it was good but not great.  I would eat it again but it wasn't anything to rave about.  In addition, I sampled their potato salad and I didn't like it. It had way too much of a mustard type taste for my liking.  \\n\\nBased on the brisket, pulled pork and pork rib, I would give this place 5 stars.  These were the proteins I specifically came to try and they didn't disappoint.  Is this place head and shoulders above a la BBQ or Terry Blacks that don't have these incredible lines?   Maybe, maybe not, but I do think the whole experience of getting in line early and talking to everyone around you is a big part of what makes this place special. I'd also like to try their turkey again.   I'm hoping it was just an off day. You have such little room for error on smoking proteins and it's hard to be spot on every day.  \\n\\nA couple FYI. \\n\\nIf you stick around they'll ask if you want to have a pit tour.  It was a fun experience to see their actual pits and get questions answered by their pit master.  I was surprised to learn that they don't temp their meat when they wrap in butcher paper around the time they would stall.  They also don't temp the brisket when they pull it off when it's done.  I personally can't imagine not temping my brisket around 190-200 to see when it's done. I guess they is why they're the expert.  \\n\\nIf you want to bypass the lines you can preorder online and there is an area on the backside where you can go pick it up.  You must order a minimum of 5 pounds and there is a 7 day turn around time.  You can't order same day and pick it up. Even if you preorder, try to get there a little early.  From what someone told me, they won't slice up your order until you get there.\\n\\nThey only serve beef ribs on Saturday.  At least that's what I was told. \\n\\nFinally, I don't know if he's there all the time but I did see Aaron Franklin while I was leaving. He was measuring some space in the back by the preorder section.  It's great to see well known people still actually actively involved in their establishments.  That's probably a big reason why this place is so successful."},{"name":"Wink & Nod","address":"3 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wink & Nod's got that cool speakeasy vibe that I love.

My kids were tired of standing around and waiting. You are mainly there to spend money on souvenirs and to drink. The line for souvenirs was annoying in itself, they had multiple people working on register. I stood in one line for 10 mins to be told that wasn't a line, I moved to another line only for them to serve the person that was behind me on the first line.  There was mention of appetizers online but only saw one person Bring out a tray of mozzarella sticks that were pretty much devoured by the first group of people on the ramp where he entered. Once you are inside and seated they start with dinner. You start off with a salad, then your main entree and then dessert that's a brownie. I ordered the chicken meal which was ok. My husband ordered the pork with shrimp and my kids got the chicken nuggets with Mac and cheese. My husband didn't like his food and couldn't finish it. The show its self felt like it was too long by the time we left the theatre it was already 10pm. Thats 4 hours being there in total. By the end we were all tired and just ready to go. The show itself felt like they just added things to keep it longer. We were supposed to be shown pictures to purchase and didn't. I did get the tickets at a discount of $19 per person.

This place was pretty bad. I can't even sugarcoat how displeasing this place was.\\n\\nAt first when I walked in, I had high hopes despite not having checked Yelp because it was a last minute choice\\n\\nWhen I walked in, I liked the interior decor, the booth was actually really uncomfortable. Rare times, I would rather sit on a regular dining chair.\\n\\nI thought we were eating sushi but the servers were dressed in some Chinese uniforms, we open the menus and it's mostly Chinese cuisine plus a beat-down picture book of over-sizes pictures of sushi rolls.. that did not look appetizing at all.\\n\\nMost of the rolls were made with imitation crab meat and smothered in sauces.\\n\\nSo I was debating on getting a Chirashi bowl (which I am very picky of ordering if I do not know how the sushi is at a place) or go with the Super Deluxe Sushi set (9pcs plus a california roll).\\n\\nWell, I decided smaller amounts of a variety of fish may be the safer choice to see what I may like.

I always go for the Korean rice cakes (ddok bokghi), which come in a delish spicy sauce, and you can order them with different toppings like seafood, veggies, and fishcakes. It's a big portion for $12, and I split it with another person. The steamed pork dumplings were $8 for 6, and they lacked flavor - pass. The service was a bit disorganized for our large group.

Even though we were seated by the plates and utensils, and had a continuing traffic of waiters coming by to grab things, we still managed to feel neglected.\\n\\nLet's start. Our waiter failed to ask the manfriend if he wanted another diet coke. When flagged down by said manfriend for another, we also found out they don't do refills here. Ooookay, that's weird, but fine. Our waiter never checked in with us at any part of the appetizers or our entrees. We both needed salt shakers, drinks, and napkins.\\n\\nTuna tartar was presented well, but small and needed at least two dashes of salt. The taro chips were a creative take and definitely the star of the show. The popcorn that everyone seemed to rave about...was a total miss. It tasted like poppycock/cvs bagged caramel popcorn was 4-5 bits of burnt bacon. It wasn't even warm! The steak tacos were completely bland and so oily. We didn't get extra napkins even as our waiter noticed the mess from the oil dripping from the tacos onto the table. Mac and cheese was interesting--I actually really enjoyed the spinach they put on top.

One caveat: I ate it at home, so it was no longer warm. \\n\\nHow was it?  Well, if I didn't know better, I would have sworn that these \\"meatballs\\" were made from some sort of meat!\\n\\nWhich is not to say they were particuarly good meatballs.\\n\\nThey definitely had a meaty texture, with small chewy chunks, mixed in with a finer grain paste, perhaps reminiscent of a typical meatball recipe containing a breadcrumb binder.  A bit dense, and not as tender as a great meatball should be.\\n\\nThe flavor was meaty, but unfortunately tasted a bit more of liver than beef or pork, and lacked any noticeable fat or juices.  Not as succulent as a great meatball should be.\\n\\nAs far as the rest of the sandwich, the tomato sauce was pleasant, a dusting of pecorino added flavor, but I would have preferred a more interesting bread than pita.\\n\\nOn one level, this sandwich was amazing when you consider that it contained zero meat. But unfortunatley, your Italian grandmother would laugh at these meatballs!  More akin to something you might get in a school cafeteria.  Or what would happen if falafel had sex with a meatball.\\n\\nFrom Clover's website: \\"Our meatball has Impossible Meat, made from 4 main ingredients: wheat, coconut, potato, and heme, a molecule made by fermenting the root part of a soybean plant. We fold in fresh garlic, parsley, pita soaked in milk, egg, then bake the meatballs in the oven. The meatballs get drenched in Martina's red sauce and topped with Pecorino.\\"  So they are not really representative of an unadulterated Impossible Meat burger, which I would like to try sometime. Perhaps that will be a better facimilie.\\n\\nFinally, out of curiosity, I did a little digging on Impossible Meat's website to understand how it is made.  As a scientist with expertise in this area, I was interested to find out that the heme-containing soy root leghemoglobin protein that is apparently the key to the meat-like flavor of Impossible Meat is produced using recombinant DNA techniques in yeast, a technology I'm very familiar with from the biotech industry.\\n\\nIn other words, Impossible Meat is a GMO-containing food!\\n\\nPersonally, like most scientists, this doesn't concern me at all.  GMOs pose no risk to human health, no matter what you've seen on some inflammatory documentary.  However, it is interesting to note that this fact is not clear in a lot of the press coverage of Impossible Meat (the links I provide above being exceptions).  Whether this is media bias or a lack of understanding, I don't know.\\n\\nHowever, I bet a fair number of Clover's customers would be surprised and disappointed to learn that Impossible Meat is a GMO food.\\n\\nIn the end, it was fun to try, but this wasn't a particularly good \\"meatball\\" sandwich, and I wouldn't order it again.  Although I'm sure it is a healthy alternative to meat.  But, sorry, I'm going to have to stick to REAL meatballs for now!\\n\\nNOTE: This is a only a review of Clover's Impossible Meatball Sandwich.  To be fair, I'm giving them a middle-of-the-road 3 stars since I haven't tried anything else on the menu.

Franklin is on top of the list for a lot of people and judging by the wait times, it must be for good reason. \\n\\nI only ordered brisket because I feel like it's a good meal to compare across different restaurants. As a group of 11 people, we ordered 6 lbs of brisket, 3 lbs pork spare ribs, 0.5 lbs of pulled pork, 3 sausage links, and a pint each of slaw and potato salad. We completely overestimated and had to give away a good amount of food. \\n\\nBrisket had some solid fatty pieces (I prefer fatty over lean). Good smokey flavor and it tasted better with BBQ sauce. I just wish I liked it without adding any sauces...I think that's a good indicator of top quality BBQ. I didn't try the ribs but my friends felt like they were too salty and that's without adding BBQ sauce. \\n\\nThe Pecan Tart was definitely the best part of the meal. It wasn't overly sweet and everything that was supposed to be crunchy was crunchy. Sometimes I get Pecan tarts and the crust and pecans on top are soft and mushy.

I'm pretty sure the chicken is done to order because it's always amazingly fresh and hot **but expect a wait because of that**. The Wait Is Worth It. I'm not too much a fan of the spice they put on when you request it to be spicy, it masks the great umami flavors that are on the chicken when it's not spicy. So my recommendation is popcorn chicken no spice. I also appreciate that they leave the box open on the popcorn chicken so it doesn't steam itself soft (some other places close up the box on crispy items and even if I unbox it immediately it's already too late. Plus points for preserving that delicious fried crisp). Docking a star because they sprinkled some cabbage/salad garnish on the pork rice but it was so old the edges of it was starting to mold.

Starting first with the carbs and moving next to the protein I began my tasting of Screen Door's cuisine with the biscuit and although good I found the texture to be a bit dense compared to those at Tin Shed, Pine State, or Woodsman Tavern but moving on to the cornbread things quickly improved as the dense bread had clearly been cooked with bacon fat, a smoky heartiness with great tooth and a loose crumb that paired marvelously with the honey but even better with the crunchy and slightly spicy fried chicken.\\n\\nMoving next to the dish I knew I'd be ordering well before I even walked up to Screen Door, the Bananas Foster French Toast would prove to be every bit worth the hour plus wait as two thick slices of golden brioche with a rich vanilla custard interior arrived bathed in boozy maple syrup tinged with cinnamon and topped with caramelized bananas and dollops of thick whipped cream.  Intensely sweet but laced with rum and every bit as good as the signature dish in New Orleans the only thing missing from the experience was the fireside flames - probably a good thing considering the close quarters.\\n\\nAt this point quite stuffed with both food and fluids my server/bartender asked if I'd be interested in dessert and as much as I knew I should defer I simply couldn't overlook the pending holiday and my fortune to be in a place serving King Cake - in this case a King Cake with Pecan Praline and Cream Cheese Filling, Sugar Sprinkles, plus Chicory coffee Anglaise that I took with me to go and indulged on at Heart Roasters after a showing of \\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\\" at the Laurelhurst Theatre.  Nicely crafted with the sweet yeast dough housing rich praline filling and deftly balanced by the slightly-bitter Anglaise I can't say this King Cake was quite as good as those in NOLA, but offered by the slice and nearly 2,500 miles separated from the praline version at Haydel's it was not too far off...and much like Screen Door I am retrospectively more than happy to have waited over an hour for that cake."},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"132 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Growing up in San Diego I am very particular about my Mexican food but Condado didn't disappoint.

The first time I tried it I wasn't thrilled but I decided to give it another try since the ambience is so cool. Starting off the place is literally always packed. That should be a good sign right? We were seated near the door and the first thing I noticed when walking in was there was no AC on. It was a pretty hot day so this was concerning, especially with a fully packed dining room. \\nThe service the first time was strange and I thought it was a fluke but the same thing happened the second time. They are friendly but it almost feels rushed in a way. We had about 3 different people ask us if we were ready to order in a span of 30 minutes. I don't think they were keeping track of who helped us.\\nNow for the important stuff, the food. It is below average at best. We ordered wings, mini dumplings, mini crab pancakes and bibimbop. The wings were underseasoned and tasted old, the dumplings were ok, the pancakes were probably the best part of the meal and they weren't great. The bibimbop was flavorless as well, literally just cubes of unseasoned chicken and rice and veggies. Really disappointing. The place itself is fun but loud, they blast hip hop on huge screens and it's really cool which is why I gave them two stars. I personally would not return."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"20445 Ih 35","city":"Kyle","stars":"1.5","text":"Two potato egg and cheese, two potato and bean, and an orange juice.\\nSimple order, right?

That being said, I tend to be particularly critical in this food category.\\n\\nNo Mas Cantina completely exceeded my expectations.  The space is exquisitely done with no detail left untouched.  Fortunate for me, my company was equally impressed with the space and didn't mind the fact that my eyes were on everything else except him.  Including the food!  \\n\\nWhich leads me into the best part... we were greeted at our table with warm, extra salty chips and homemade roasted tomato salsa which was smoky and delicious.  We ordered a side of guac - which was the only disappointment of the day because it was a tad too creamy and bland for my taste.  We shared the steak and shrimp fajita entree which consisted of ginormous grilled shrimp and beautifully prepared flank steak.  The house margaritas were perfect and fresh and the service was excellent as well.  \\n\\nHonestly, the only thing missing from No Mas is the beach.

They have definitely got the REAL taste of China going on here. These people use fabulously combined spices to bring out the most in their dishes!\\n\\nI was surprised to find a spice-flavor I usually identify with authentic Indian food. I really like it- cooked-in, but not left in the dish. When you bite into this seed-like\\n spice it gives off a strong sour/biting flavor that attacks the sides of your tongues' palette. It's overpowering when directly chewed. On the other hand, when cooked into a dish, it adds another delightful dimension to the flavor...enhancing and lifting it to bring out the spiciness and still keep things in balance. \\n\\nIf you want my recommendations, definitely get the dry friend green beans, the Hunan tofu, and the braised-slow-cooked beef or the house special beef. Wow! \\n\\nThe chicken- as ever with any Chinese restaurant- is annoying to deal with because of the bones, so it isn't a \\"date\\" food. However, if your date knows you pretty well- get in there! It's juicy and flavorful! \\n\\nSeveral dishes rely on a delicate balance between salty and sweet- but they really do a great job of preparing a mouth-watering dish that speaks volumes to the palette. The spicy stuff is right up my alley because of how it doesn't set my mouth on fire- just SECTIONS of my tongue. \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is very stylish, not so much trendy, and is likely to be filled with family, friends, and couples. But they also have a lovely bar set up with stools to accommodate the random individual that just wants a cold one with their quiet meal. \\n\\nGive them a shot- they've got my vote!"},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Watched a bartender pick out a ice cube of my expresso martini.

We were attended too right away and our food came out quicker than I expected being how busy it was. We ordered the crab ragoon and it was sooo delicious. They make it different and put the crab as a dip instead. This created an even distribution of crunch in every bite, versus the typical ragoon where the crunch is only in the sides and a bit soggy in the middle. I also ordered the \\"prime time\\", which was a sushi roll with lobster and fillet... so yummy. The prices were a bit on the higher side but you pay for what you get... a fab meal! This place just isn't a restaurant that would be your first choice when you're on a budget. The roll was actually in the hamburger roll section.

I've never been to Freshii before but immediately liked the looks of the Fiesta salad (field greens, black beans, avocado, aged cheddar, corn, pico de gallo, cilantro lime vinaigrette). When I ordered, the guy asked me if I wanted 'protein' in the form of tofu, chicken, steak or turkey. I asked if the chicken was 'real chicken' or was it the pressed processed chicken you see at places like these. He assured me it was 'real chicken breast'. \\n\\nSo despite there only being 2 people ahead of me and 5-6 employees behind the counter, I waited a good 10 minutes for my salad. There only seemed to be one girl making the orders while everyone else kind of wandered around. When they finally handed it to me, I thought for a minute I got the wrong order. Everything in the bowl was the same light green/beige color, and everything looked mushy and wet. I also noticed there wasn't any chicken in it. I let them know and they proceeded to reach into a bin and take a handful of something and toss it onto my salad. \\n\\nJust as I had suspected previously, the chicken was in fact not real chicken, but wet, mushy, processed 'mystery meat'. Not the freshly cooked 'real chicken breast' I had been promised. By this time I just wanted to eat something so I removed the 'chicken' and  picked through the rest of the salad. It tasted 'okay', but everything was mushy, wet, and tasted liked a bagged salad that had been sitting around for too long, not the freshly made salad they imply from the pictures and descriptions on their menu. Not worth the $12 in my opinion. \\n\\nAlso after I left the mall I realized they never gave me my bottle of water that I paid for.

It was tasty, freshly made and not to heavy or greasy even though it was fried. The only downside to food trucks in general that I've eaten at is price.

We ordered drinks and a salad and that was fine.  Then our meals came out and my filet had lobster sauce on it (which I had ordered without).  Ok, fine. The waitress said they were fixing it and the owner was even working on it.  A few minutes later, she brought out a new steak (no sauce this time), but It was not every very warm AND when I cut in to it, it was NOT medium well (like I ordered).  Because I dont get steak that often, and it is fairly pricy, I didn't want to eat steak other than how I had ordered it.  The waitress did not come back for like 15 minutes, of course my husband had finished his meal by now and I got to sit and watch him eat.  When she did come back, I told her the steak was not cooked medium well as I ordered it and since my husband had already eaten, just to take it off the bill.  To my surprise, she was like...ok!  Then she asked if I wanted to order cheese cake!!!???  Seriously, I didn't eat....so maybe I want desert?  I politely, said no and she went and got us the bill.  Meanwhile, I had no Diet Coke in my glass...no offer for a refill.   No apology, just pay up and be on your way.  I was really surprised that the we were told the owner was in the kitchen and never bothered to come out and at least say they were sorry.

Now, I'm not sure why they only give 1 slice of bread, but I didn't end up needing two. I suggest putting the bread on top of the meat because ultimately it was super soggy underneath the meat so I just ate it with a fork. The brisket was really fatty.

However, once you manage to go inside, you'll be greeted by very friendly staff who are excited to provide you with amazing ice cream. \\n\\nNow what makes this ice cream place different than most, aside from its super cute decor of green leaf walls and upside ice cream cone lamps, is the unique flavor offerings. Flavors like Black Ash Coconut, Ube, and Pandan with Ube keep you intrigued and wanting to come back to try more. If that wasn't enough, they have a black waffle cone for your ice cream, which is perfect for those picture moments (and they have more than enough perfect spots to take it at). \\n\\nOverall, the ice cream here is super rich, delicious and most of all creamy! Let's also not forget that all the ice cream is homemade so it has that extra touch of love that makes it taste even better.

You can get as creative as you want with your order, but the classic bibimbap is always a winner. If you want to control the spice/sauce level, just ask for sauce on the side. They are always happy to accommodate as well as explain their dishes! \\n\\nProTips: \\nThe spicy chicken and spicy pork pairs really well with the creamy garlic(gf!) dressing. \\n\\nTheir sesame peanut dressing is also really good, and for some reason, i find it works really well with their noodle dishes. \\n\\nThe bulgogi chicken and bulgogi pork are sweet and savory. So i like to get the gochujang(spicy) sauce with that. Or the house vinegarette  to add some tang. \\n\\nThe rice bowls always come with a soy drizzle, unless specified otherwise. So just ask for a specific dressing when you order if you dont want soy sauce. (Ive also asked for a sauce after ive received my order, and they were more than happy to provide it)\\n\\nThe meat is always pretty well seasoned (probably can stand on its own) so i usually like to get the dressings on the side, but then I kinda feel bad about creating more unnecessary landfill :-/.. lol..\\n\\nALSO their beverages are all soooooo goood. You wouldnt expect that, but trust me! Try one and thank me later. \\n\\nThis truck just has that classic Korean warmth. Not just in their food, but also in their staff.

Fellow Yelper, Michelle V. wanted to visit this place for her birthday and a group of her friends and I went. \\n\\nWe arrived there around 11am and Juan and I were a bit concerned with a line we saw that went all the way to the parking lot. There's was this sweet lady greeting everybody and explaining that the line moves fast (and fast it did move) and she provided a menu with their original menu and weekend specials. She explained that we have to take a look at the menu and decide what we want so as soon as we get in, we order and have a seat. \\n\\nTheir weekend special, \\"The Breakfast Club\\" immediately caught my eye! \\"A three thick-sliced brioche french toast, layered with 2 over-medium eggs and 4 slices of applewood smoked bacon\\" for $13.75. Oh yeah, I knew what I wanted.  I don't eat bacon so I asked the hostess about substitutions which she pointed out that the policy is \\"substitutions are politely declined\\". No biggie, that made Juan's day since he always wants me to ask for bacon on the side so he can eat it. Nevertheless, Hostess suggested I would get, as a side, their friend green tomatoes (not on menu) and that I did!! I had never tried fried green tomatoes so this was a welcomed suggestion. \\n\\nI ordered my french toast and regular house coffee on the side, while Juan got their \\"cheezy-q farmer's breakfast sandwich\\" which is \\"ciabatta topped with BBQ pulled pork, 5 cheese mac & cheese, crispy fried onions & 2 over-medium eggs\\" for $12.75, also with a cup of coffee (around $3.00, give or take).\\n\\nSat down, took a look at the decor (very creative decor with baking utensils on the walls) and waited for our food. Wait time was about 15 minutes (give or take), our food arrived and we were amazed!  Food was warm, delicious and like Michelle V. said, \\"bursting with flavor\\".  Couldn't finish my french toast, even though I wanted too, since the portions are hefty and worth their cost.  Digested our food while we talked, and later checked out the pastries, which I decided to take a few for home and some for a fellow Yelper that soon moves out of Florida and wanted to check Se7en Bites, but couldn't.

(Starts are based on MY food and the overall experience at the restaurant)\\n\\nLets get into it! \\n\\nTHE PLACE: House of Blues is conveniently located in Disney Springs, which is in the middle of \\"touristy\\" Orlando area. Disney Springs is a must see if your visiting.Since it is Disney Spring, parking isn't any issue but please be advised that some distance walking will take part in your journey to deliciousness. House of Blue has a very laid-back and appealing bar/entertainment area outside, which seems great, however, with Florida heat and humidity, the restaurant inside was much more appealing. Inside, the restaurant is clean and spacious and well decorated. In fact, between the live musician and the attention-grabbing decor, the food wait time was short and entertaining. Please be advised that this restaurant is a bit leveled, so heels,drunks or wheelchair -accessibility may be tricky.   \\n\\nTHE FOOD: On my first visit here, I went with my boyfriend and with another couple. Everyone had their own, and different opinion on their selected dish, but KNOW that my dish was absolutely the best and I cannot wait to return for more! \\nBoyfriends dish: Juicy Lucy Burger: In fact, it was juicy. This burger packs a punch of flavor with the patty having bacon already IN it. The bun was sweet and fluffy. The fries always remained crispy and retained heat well. \\nGood choice. \\n\\nFriend 1 dish: Country Friend steak: Portion is great (even had left overs), however, he was rater disappointed, as he found the chicken to be on the dry side. He accompanied this dish with mac and cheese, which looked cheesier than what it really was and the street corn which was amazing. Overall, dish was good.\\n\\nFriend 2 dish: Shrimp po' boy: Again, overall ok, but not worth ordering. The mayo was not on the bun, rather served on the side (not sure why?) and the FRIED shrimp with the sandwich, just made the sandwich dry. Lacked flavor and was nothing to rave about. \\n\\nMY dish: THE BRISKET TACOS! ahhhh! where to start with these tacos from heaven!!! The portion was enough to fulfill, so no, it isn't \\"sample\\" size as I like to say. The tacos tasted fresh, the brisket was flavorful and juicy(so juice that it would drip!). The coleslaw within the taco were undetectable (I hate coleslaw by the way) as the flavor of the brisket surpassed them. With my tacos, I ordered (side dish) street corn, which was spectacular as well. This is a MUST HAVE!  \\n\\nMy friends ordered alcoholic drinks, which were strong (good job) and tasty. \\n\\nTHE SERVICE: Our waiter was happy,attentive,honest, energetic and a great listener.  Everyone else in the restaurant seemed knowledgeable as well, we didnt have any issues. \\n \\nCons? The water had a terrible taste. It tasted like a hint of lemon with a splash or clorox.

When i ordered I mentioned adding the bone marrow which was replied with a -\\" yes ofcourse\\". When I went in to pick up I wanted to confirm ( because yes they have missed it many times before) and was faced with a confused server. He went in to speak to the chef ( who btw looked pissed at his question)  and came back to tell me that the bone marrow comes with doordash orders only. OK- that's a little confusing! You will advertise food in a certain way and then change your standards to your convenience? Kinda need to figure out what you will do there. Please make up your mind and have system which is not bias and/or sounds extremely unprofessional! Either have it as an option of \\"add on\\" which will make your pho pricier than what it is right now ( already on a high range) or scarp the idea altogether ( btw that bone marrow is the only reason I would have pho from you guys) . Also have your service personal trained properly with the information \\n\\nNumber 2- on Friday I ordered a quick lunch. You can judge yourself how the bahn mis arrived at my door. Half open LOL! Sure I will pay a delivery company money and also pay you top dollars for Vietnamese food and get my delivery like this- travelling in god knows how clean of a car and currier!

One can order a half or full order of either meat, or choose the ¬º bird and ¬º slab option. I ordered a half slab of ribs and three sides.\\n\\n*Half Slab: I'm glad I didn't order the full slab, because this is an incredible hunk of meat. And about it, like what many other reviewers have written, the meat falls right off the bone (like how it should). The BBQ sauce is a nice blend of savory and sweet, and it pairs well.  \\n\\nHowever, these are the type of ribs that NEED the sauce. I come from the tribe that favors ribs that don't need a dipping sauce, but still can appreciate a good one when tasted.\\n\\n**Potato Salad: Very mayonnaise-y, which is not my jam, but still pretty solid and hearty.\\n\\n**Collard Greens: Super savory! This turned out to be my favorite side.\\n\\n**Mac & Cheese: Not so great. Pretty plain, but might satisfy someone's M&C craving.\\n\\nSide note: I recommend getting only one or two sides. Ordering three sides was definitely a mistake. \\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nThe staff there are incredibly sweet, and there's a young woman who oversees the eating area that helps out with refills and provides napkins and cleaning wipes. \\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nImagine old-school Atlanta meets blues. This also entails famous people and their respective signatures hang on the wall, a small stage for a band, and both outdoor and indoor seating. Bathrooms are sanitary, too. So, this is my kind of place.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nTotally reasonable. $12.50 for a half slab. $1.60 for the potato salad. $2.50 for both the collard greens and mac & cheese.

I ordered a dry Cappuccino, there is only one way it's done, it's been made the exact same way since it's conception and for this little coffee shop in Oregon to be so arrogant as to redefine it is utterly absurd.  This is why the Hipster revolution in Portland has ruined our city and now our historical espresso drinks.  Guilder need to research...

I received a message in my email from the business owner shortly to shame me about my review, including the following message:\\n\\n\\"We spoke to the server to learn the situation and she told me that you were complaining about the kanikama but now you wrote to us about the fish. You have a plate of 18 pieces of sushi, you have a few pieces left and making excuses to get discount, this is not tolerable.  We usually treat our regulars to extra food or discount anyways, but not because there's anything wrong with our food.  We strive our best to serve and treat our customer the way they deserve to be treated, but this kind of behavior is not welcome. \\"\\n\\nTo be clear I actually never asked for any discount at the restaurant even with the fish that tasted rotten. What the server or owner chooses to do as a reaction to my pointing out the issue with a portion of the meal is their choice. I've consistently tipped over 20-25% so I've never had an issue with the payment. To suggest any intention on my part of wanting a discount where I had not asked for any is not only insulting but not a way to treat a paying customer. My review is purely based on the food that made me concerned about getting sick, and the follow up treatment of the matter. To be honest I did not expect to receive any message back on a review. \\n\\nAfter I informed them they may want to check on the fish, I said thank you, paid the full bill with tip, and left. For the owner to tell me writing an honest review about how I felt treated at a restaurant is a \\"behavior that's not welcome\\", seems to defeat the purpose of a review platform. I had a not so great experience on my last dine-in, usually with follow up dining experience I would update my reviews. \\n\\nWhen the owner insults me in a response to my review, it makes me feel personally threatened and unwelcome as a customer.

My favourite was Bao Chicka Bao Bao - perfectly fried chicken with some light acidity in the sauce. In Two Worlds Collide, I found the pork belly too fatty and the hoisin sauce too sweet and thick. The ratio of bun to filler seem off as well - too much bun, not enough filling. As for the kimchi fries, there was a big piece of crispy pork skin within which I found didn't quite fit in in terms of flavours or texture. I would have liked more acidity in the fries (maybe more kimchi) than more fat since the fries are already fried. \\n\\nRestaurant is small and smelled a little damp.

It almost falls into that category of 'doing too much'. We visited on Friday around 8pm and it was fairly innocuous. Walking through a generously sized alfresco dining area (which happens to occupy most of the outdoor space in front of the theater) led to the hostess. The interior is reminiscent of an updated European bistro, it's inviting and relaxing. \\n\\nThe dinner menu is limited and yet somehow it was hard to decide on an entree. Nothing really stood out to 'wow' me; completely subjective I realize but true nonetheless.\\n\\nThe drink menu, however, is expansive and lends credence to the ever-growing vibe that this place is more of a trendy drinkery than a quality eatery. \\n\\nWe noticed one middle-aged couple (if they lived to be 100) with their small grandson grow increasingly uncomfortable as the lights began to gradually turn down and the music (techno/EDM) became quite juxtaposed to the maturity of the interior. \\n\\nThe food was mediocre and perhaps slightly overpriced. The trout was served skin on, though it was well cooked; albeit in a rather uninspired lemon/butter sauce. The vegetables were remarkably fresh and crisp. Also worth noting that the food took an unusually long time in the kitchen for its rather insipid nature and mundane plating. \\n\\nService was actually typical of European bistros, which if you're unfamiliar, largely sucks (by Western standards anyway). \\n\\nWe wrapped up around 9:30pm and the vibe had completely shifted.

This is very typical of a tapas style restaurant.\\n\\nThe beef is supplied by Creekstone Farms (as a Texan I absolutely love it and have had it for AMAZING BBQ). With that said the meat for the burgers and the steak are Halal.  The lamb is also Halal. Let your waiter/waitress know so that they can omit the pork ingredients of the dish or substitute with something else. \\n\\nDinner experience:\\nWe were walk-ins on a Friday early evening and were seated right away. Our waitress (Amber) was super attentive and gave great suggestions. Never did we feel like we were lacking in service. The burger was absolutely amazing! We had one made as is from the menu and one with a pork free cheese substitute-both cooked medium rare and both tasted amazing!\\n\\nBrunch experience:\\nWe made a reservation ahead of time. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside. They have drip coffe and their lemonade is freshly squeezed at the restaurant. The smoked lamb hash has a wonderful flavor and the buttermilk biscuit sandwich was great (loved the bacon on it as well as the biscuit itself). Service was one again great even though we were outside.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this place!

I could speak for days about how much I enjoyed the staff: cashiers, cooks and management alike. Fianc√© and I were there for food 1-2x/week and I was in there 3-4x/week just to grab coffee. At least once a month I'd come in and order a bag of breakfast bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches for my family (or twice as much of out of towners were visiting) -- we're from NYC and it's as close as we've gotten to the on-the-go, true to city life, bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches we've found in Orlando (Pickles in Altamonte also his the spot in this category, but they're a different story).\\n\\nWe've done breakfast, lunch and dinner there -- just wine and apps, too. Love the sandwiches and salads on the menu. Keep an eye out for their homemade soups -- so good! \\n\\nI think that it's mostly locals that hang out there. The patio is mostly shaded by umbrellas, with tables for two and others for larger groups. Pups are welcome! But if you need to go inside, they stay outside. As long as your pup has adequate social skills and is well behaved, it shouldn't be an issue. Most of the pups that spend time there are very well behaved, no matter their size! \\n\\nThe parking on property is limited but you can easily find a spot across the street by the lake. Make yourself a regular there! They still know me by name even though we moved away months ago.

And this is coming from a bunch of breakfast haters. Of all the places we ate in Portland, this was our favorite by far. We came here in the morning as we were about to leave for a hike as we figured we needed all the fuel we could get. They had just opened and we were warmly greeted and seated. We ordered the:\\n\\nChicken and waffles - we had a choice of 1-3 pieces of chicken. Our waiter told us that a piece consists of a 6 oz chicken breast and that if we were ordering anything else (which we intended on doing) that 1 piece was plenty. He was right. The chicken breast was a huge piece of juicy tender well seasoned, well breaded, crispy piece of heaven. Omg. The waffles were made with sweet potatoes. The perfect combination of crispy and soft. Honestly you can't go wrong with ordering this.\\n\\nFried chicken and biscuit - for anyone who likes a savory and hearty breakfast this is perfect! The biscuits were soft yet flakey. The gravy was delicious and honestly I don't know how they get chicken breast to be so moist and not dry. This was my boyfriends favorite. Came with a side of cheesy grits. We don't eat grits so I can't say I'm thrilled by the texture but it wasn't bad!\\n\\nPraline bacon - $7.50 for 3 pieces of bacon but I had to try. It seemed so intriguing. If you're a fan of salty and sweet this is perfect. But it was too sweet for the two of us. We ended scrapping off the praline and adding it to our sweet potato waffle and problem solved. Delicious.\\n\\nFood was AMAZING. And service was top notch! Shout out to the guy from NYC and the guy with a ponytail. Favorite place to eat in Portland and one of the cheaper spots.

The bartender was nice and the portion size of the hummus plate was generous for something on the happy hour menu. The spread of the different types of hummus was delicious. The bartenders were young and probably should have cut off a very drunk patron that seemed to be a friend or know one or more of the bartenders. The patron claimed to be of age and was a sloppy drunk spilling his drink while slurring his words to us during conversation. It was a slower quiet evening so perhaps they needed the business?

This was my first time here and I have to say that there was a mix of good and not so good which justifies my 3 star rating.\\n\\nLet's start with the good....\\nThe restaurant is conveniently located in Harvard Sq, but on Brattle Street so it is not in the midst of the craziness that can be Harvard Sq.  Between garage parking, free street parking and the T (Red Line) we all met up in this convenient location.\\n\\nOnce inside I was impressed with the size including a long bar.  We gathered there and enjoyed some wine until all arrived and then we were brought to our table.  We had a reservation and they were on time in seating us.  I have reported here before that many restaurants have lost the art of a reservation by just treating you as a guaranteed guest for the night, but not seating you at your desired time.  Alden & Harlow were timely and that is appreciated so that we could get to our after dinner activities.\\n\\nLighting was good and we also enjoyed playing name that tune with a mixture of 80s and 90s and even some 2000s music playing overhead without making the restaurant too loud that you have to shout or are unable to hear those in your party across the table or at the other end.\\n\\nNow for the not so good....\\nI will start with the menu.  Most here will say how great the menu is., and it is if you are prepared for what the offerings are.  Well I am going to point out a couple of flaws that could easily be remedied for future diners.  \\n\\nFirst, make sure the menu on line is current.  Several of the dishes were not on the menu handed to us by the host (e.g., grilled bluefin).  This makes sense given the changing seasonal and monthly menu offerings, but it is the year 2016 so just take 10 seconds and upload the new one as a PDF!!\\n\\nSecond, where does it say that this is a tapas like restaurant on the menu?  It doesn't.  It wan't until we were seated and talking about what we would order when our waiter stopped over and asked if we ever ate here before.  Then he explained that they are small dishes made for sharing and that each person would normally order 2.  I guess that makes sense why most dishes were $13-$17 but we should figure double that per person when the check comes.  And what are with the random boxes?  We spent time looking for the legend telling us what a few items were segregated by boxes for our waiting to just tell us that is a meaningless design.  Oh....\\n\\nWe ordered a lot of dishes and most were good, but why don't they bring extra utensils to serve them with when sharing?  One word....tongs.  Grilled & smoked carrots were very good and surprisingly spicy which we liked.  The fingerling sweet potato and roasted sun-choke and charred broccoli were also very good.  The fried chicken thighs with waffle were also good, but we wish we ordered a second order to share with more in our party.  The same goes with the corn pancakes, very good but too small and we needed a second order.  Maybe we should have asked the waiter more questions, or maybe he should have given more insight into portion sizes.  The one thing I din't much care for were the egg yoke ravioli which were rather bland and only luke warm.  As I said we had many items on the table, but there wasn't much color other than the green of the broccoli.  The dessert menu was lackluster and I was disappointed they don't have an espresso machine, but only regular coffee for after dinner.  \\n\\nAll in all, if you are into small plates and lots of vegetarian offerings and can be a little adventurous in your dining, I recommend Alden & Harlow.  But, if you are more reserved like some of my party and looking for the \\"special burger\\" or more meat offerings, then keep searching Yelp for that match."},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"++ pizza fresh and good ingredients \\n+ caprese salad is delicious \\n+ all the italian fixins at a little bar\\n\\n- overpriced: for the quantity, not the quality.\\n- portions: wish they had individual portions\\n- drinks: only bottled drinks are available, and they are quite expensive. wish they had a cheaper option, such as a self serve soda fountain, maybe even with special italian sodas!\\n\\ni still go here often, but feel it in my budget when i do. usually spend $45 for just me (pizza + salad). have learned to order the bigger sizes for a better deal, take to go, get drinks elsewhere, and then eat the leftover pizza for a couple days."},{"name":"SuperPlay","address":"9300 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was a lot of fun!

The bowling spaces were claustrophobic and crammed together. The wait staff carried beers threw the bowling parties and spilled beer along the wooden floors which is very bad for bowling and bowling shoes. When I asked for a napkin, to wipe up the spilled beer, I was greeted by a strange look from the bartender who spilt it. If it could possibly get worse, on top of all of that, families bring children there and let them run wild throughout the lanes and no one says anything. The lack of attention to the children all over the place was ludicrous and it's gonna take me some time to get over it. If you bring your children to a bowling alley, please do not allow them to do snow angels in the open lanes.

Unfortunately, once you're in the area, the options are very limited. After searching online for anything except tacos, Gary's Grill came up in the search results. Having little information or pictures about it, I decided to give it a try. It sneaks up on you when driving down Mesa, so watch out for it. It looks like it used to be a small office and it's very small inside. No air conditioning, and only a couple fans blowing in the dining area.\\n\\nThere was only one other party in the restaurant, so the service was quick and friendly. There was absolutely no chicken anywhere on the menu. Since I didn't want tacos (otherwise I wouldn't have ended up here), the other options were a chicken fried steak sandwich, burgers, or a pizza. Being someone who almost never eats beef, this was quite disappointing. I mentally struggled and went with a cheeseburger and fries.\\n\\nAs I pull out my credit card...I look over and see the sign that says \\"NO CREDIT CARDS - Cash and Check only\\". I can't remember the last time I was in a restaurant (or any business, for that matter) that didn't accept credit/debit. I let the very nice lady know I didn't have cash, and she still started my order and said the convenience store down the road had an ATM. Once I returned, the food was perfectly timed to be ready after I paid.\\n\\nThe food itself was nothing to write home about. The burger had no seasoning on it, so it was probably just a frozen meat patty. The cheese wasn't melted all the way around, so the outer edges were still cold and the inner portions were melted. The bun looks as if it was put on the grill because it was a bit burnt in places. The fries, like the burger, had no seasoning on it...so some ketchup and pepper took care of that.\\n\\nIn summary, this is a small, quiet, and clean restaurant with a friendly staff. They do not accept credit or debit cards. There are no chicken options on the menu, and no seasoning on the burgers or fries leads to a bland taste.

They definitely overestimated the wait time, which is better than underestimating for sure.\\n\\nAfter we got to our table, which was actually a set of three very nice couches around a coffee table, everything got much better. The crowd seemed to clear out by 11PM and half of my group stayed until 1AM, leaving us as one of the last parties still in the restaurant.\\n\\nThe drinks were good, but nothing mindblowing. I thought the menu was cute, but the first cocktail I ordered felt weak (don't remember what I ordered, something with fruit vodka). Because the cocktail felt weak, I decided to ditch the specials and order my regular drink: the whiskey sour. After two of those, I still wasn't feeling much of anything. Ended the night with some tequila-based cocktail, which wasn't the smartest on my part, but that definitely got me there (finally, after four drinks. As a small Asian girl with rather average tolerance, I don't normally need to drop $60+ to get buzzed). My boyfriend was pretty much in the same boat, until he ordered the Bootlegger.\\n\\nWink & Nod is definitely a place I can, and did, spend hours with friends in the right environment. The couches are such a plus, and if I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. The beginning of the night was just too loud and too crowded for my liking, and I could not imagine spending my entire night standing near the bar."},{"name":"ARI Celebration","address":"671 Front St, Ste 100","city":"Celebration","stars":"3.5","text":"The only sushi you can find in the area!

Whereas I found our service to be lacking in attention during my previous visit, I found it not to be the case this time around. Special shout out to our waitress in particular (I'm so sorry I forgot her name!) who we found to be super friendly and personable--& not just to my friend and I but to all the guests she was serving! I'm really glad Sonsie proved my last review wrong and showed me that they do take good service seriously. Whether this is the case all the time and with other customers, I will never know... but Sonise is forgiven in my book!\\n\\nFor brunch I got their eggs benedict, which I found to be pretty average. There was nothing wrong with it in terms of taste or presentation, but I can't help but feel like I could find this same dish at other brunch places around the area. My friend got the BLT sandwich grilled chicken and found it to be satisfactory. I tried the chips that it comes with and it was super crispy and perfectly seasoned!\\n\\nHowever, the highlight of our dining experience has got to be the Moscow mules, which is honestly SUPER GOOD. However a word of caution: their Moscow mule pitcher for 2-4 people is not for the faint at heart--let's just say my friend and I got very tipsy at brunch trying to finish everything ha ha ha... The cauldron that the Moscow mule comes in is deceivingly very deep, and we found ourselves pouring and pouring and pouring some the delicious drink into our cups all throughout our meal! It might be a bit too much for 2 people, but probably more suitable for 3-4 drinkers (unless my friend and I are just lightweights lol).\\n\\nOverall, Sonsie has redeemed itself as a solid brunch place. The food itself is good (though average), but there's no denying that what makes this place stand out is its beautiful location along Newbury, the classy causal vibes, and its reputation as a boston brunch staple!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So good!

We were seated at a high top next to the bar. We ordered several drinks (5) and 3 appetizers. When another girlfriend came late and tried to sit with us that is when the maitre d' , waitress, and bartender became nasty. We couldn't take a chair from another high top in the bar area. Even though we sat with numerous bar chairs butting up next to our table. When we attempted to turn a chair that became open at the bar which was abutting our table we got the wrath of the bartender. He told us in a nasty torn that we couldn't turn a vacant seat around even though the drinks we were purchasing came from his bar and the turning of the chair did not block the bar in any manner that was not already blocked by our table. As patrons that work on that street daily and purchased drinks and food I felt that we were mistreated. Our friend had to stand at the side of the table and have a drink. \\nBecause of the way we were treated, I will never go back!!!!t\\nAdditionally,  the drinks are pricey for the size.

I read the reviews, good and bad, but couldn't get over the idea of sushi and burgers at the same place. Mister loves a juicy burger and I love a unique specialty sushi roll. Unfortunately the food was just okay. Universal food spots are notoriously overpriced and underwhelming. I'm always hoping to find something that changes my mind but have yet to find it here. Downtown Disney/ Disney Springs has great food so Universal needs to step it up.\\n\\nUpon recommendation from our server we had crab rangoon dip which was so so. Tasted nothing like crab rangoon but rather had a mushy tuna salad dip consistency that lacked flavor. Mister had the truffle cheese burger. Patty was thick and ugly, lacking in flavor. The truffle cheese helped but nothing worth coming back for when a place considers itself 50% burger focused. I had some sushi rolls that again were recommended but aren't worth mentioning given any sushi here will be meh. Lacking in distinct flavor and quality ingredients. Both rolls were pricey but filled with imitation crab and fried shrimp. Fish on top of the roll did not taste too fresh. \\n\\nThe best thing we had here was the smore milkshake. I would come back again for a milkshake and only a milkshake. It was that good with toasted mallow on top and a chocolate graham cracker rim. $6 and only the size of a pint glass, it was a tad overpriced too.\\n\\nLeaving here we felt pretty blah even though neither of us finished our meals. We stopped by the restrooms (on the top floor...) before leaving to wander City Walk. This was probably the weirdest/ worst thing about the entire ambiance. There is some strange voice over type recording that plays over the speakers in the bathroom. Not music or even jokes. I thought it was a mistake until I asked a server what the heck was going on. She said something about it being proper english, hill billy and something else but who cares because it still does not make sense. Stupid idea that just kinda freaked me out as I was trying to use the restroom. It got me out of there quick so maybe that was the goal. A weird end to a lame meal. \\n\\nI'll take my milkshake to go, thanks."},{"name":"No Mas!

I walked into a large building that said \\"Mas!\\" but I didn't realize I was walking into \\"Poco Mas\\" which is part of the restaurant technically, but on the other side, and serving up only drinks and tapas. It was all a bit confusing, but luckily I had a very sweet bartender who allowed me to order food and eat it there - it was a slow evening. The restaurant is also beautiful and they have a cute shop next door where you can buy some neat trinkets. \\n\\nSo anyway, I ordered up the fish tacos, and they arrived very quickly. The first thing I noticed was that they were on flour, which the menu had states. The second thing I noticed was that the fish was fried, which was not stated on the menu. I prefer grilled fish, so I was a little put off. That feeling didn't last past my first bite though, it was pretty good! The sauce and the jicama coleslaw was the best part for me. The dish also came with rice and beans, which weren't anything special. I overheard the bartender talking about a $5 margarita, so I ordered one without looking at the menu... it ended up being $12, so that was kind of a bummer. It was strong and tasty though. \\n\\nOverall, not the best fish tacos I've ever had, but it was a good meal and I left feeling full."},{"name":"Moon Indian Cuisine","address":"2144 Johnson Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is authentic and full of flavor.

Our problem with the food is that it took 50 min from the time we ordered to arrival to our table.

As an LA resident, I have very high expectations for Vietnamese cuisine. \\n\\nFirst, the pho had the best presentation I've ever seen. I typically don't pay much attention to food aesthetics, but having the bean sprouts and basil plated on a Vietnamese pagoda was pretty dope. The broth has a great  flavor and the craziest thing no MSG (gives me headaches)! The beef filet was tender and juicy, and I was especially surprised about the meat ball as I haven't tasted another Bo Vien as good. Most importantly, they include BONE MARROW. This may or may not be important  to you, but as an avid pho consumer it's something I always want but never get until today! For a pho Tai Bo Vien it was definitely top 2, but not 2.\\n\\nThe banh mi tit Nuong was different from what I'm accustomed to. For one, I learned the bread is their own recipe and something that they make fresh on a daily basis. It has a perfect amount of crunch balanced with fluff.

My favorite was the chicken apricot sausage - very unusual and with a great balance of flavors between the meat and the fruit accents.  My husband loved the ribs and partook a few times. I can understand why many do not want to fill their tummies with anything other than meat, but I really appreciated the side offerings of rice, black beans and potatoes to give a bit of palate cleansing to all the meaty offerings.  The rice and beans were outstanding and greatly complimented the meat.  We had all been rather excited about the lamb, which our waiter helped keep an eye out for.  Sadly, for me, it was a little disappointing when it arrived.  It was very rare (perhaps because they were rushing it) but also quite strong.  \\n\\nThe dining experience was really fun, with servers with meat on swords wandering about offering you a bit of this or a bit of that.  We were all provided with small tongs for catching the meat as it was carved off the larger hunk.  Our table did end up a little messy, but I thought the servers did an incredible job of juggling sharp objects and heavy skewers of meat and circling around the tables to each diner.  Overall, a really lovely night and some place I can see us coming back to celebrate a special event."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm glad my first ramen experience was with Tatsu-Ya! It was so good the first time I went again in one weekend. \\n\\nIt's a small place so to be safe try to get around right during opening. On Friday for dinner, the BF and I arrived 10 minutes prior to opening with just only another group waiting. But Sunday dinner around 7:30 was a good 35 minute wait. It's not bad if you're in a group of friends. I prefer waiting in a designated line than waiting on a beeper to vibrate at another restaurant. \\n\\nOn our visit I tried the #1 ramen with brussel sprouts, corn, garlic, and spicy bomb. I regret adding the spicy bomb because the broth did not need it. It was surprising for me because I usually like spicy ramen. The broth was on the verge a tad bit too salty. I couldn't finish my broth. But the portion was perfect for me. The chashsu pork should be a little fatty because it is pork belly after all. The BF ordered the mi-so-spicy ramen which was a little too hot for him. But he really enjoyed it and even had to order extra noodles. \\n\\nOn our second visit we took his little brother. I ordered the same #1 without the garlic or spicy bomb. The broth was much better that day. Not really salty at all and I finished my bowl! Little bro ordered the mi-so-spicy and was pleased. BF ordered the mi-so-not and definitely prefer this version. We tried the katsu slider and it was delicious! Not sure what the patty was made out of it but it didn't taste like the meat. It reminded me of almost like a falafel but softer. The potato salad was really refreshing and not heavy with mayo. \\n\\nUPDATE: I recently tried them for lunch and had the ol' skool ramen which features a lighter chicken broth. Though delicious, I was bummed that they only offer 2 different ramens and limited toppings for lunch. If it's your first time, go during dinner for the best selection!\\n\\nCan't wait for the colder days to have some ramen!

Known as the go-to spot for southern food, specializing in fried chicken, there are plenty of other restaurants where you can get food just as good, but at lower prices and with friendlier service.\\n\\nI visited on a Saturday morning for brunch as a group of 10. We made reservations (which requires a $35/person hold in case of no-show) and they had a table ready for us upstairs. It was rainy and, despite being summer, quite cool inside, the AC was blasting and the vent was actually dripping condensation onto our table. When we told our server, he basically said to deal with the dripping, but at least they turned the AC off.\\n\\nWe started with some pitchers of mimosa, and the server gave us a very strong attitude for not ordering appetizers. Most of us had checked out reviews or the menu and knew their dishes are heavy, we really just wanted mains.\\n\\nOnto the food review portions, most mains around around $20, our table had a selection or chicken and waffles, King biscuit, smoked brisket benedict,and shrimp and grits. The portion size is good, the dishes are tasty. However, at Joy cafe or some of the other popular brunch restaurants in the area, the mains are less expensive and more tasty. SCK dishes are quite heavy due to the amount of oil. Because it was a friend's birthday, they brought her a dessert (but then charged $8 for it).\\n\\nWe told our server in advance we would need 6 checks (4 couples and 2 solo), but it took probably 20 minutes to get our checks completed. They took the dessert off after asking. As is normal, they charged gratuity for a large group (20%), so our server earned $100+, I guess he knew that gratuity was guaranteed and the motivation was low. The server was passive aggressive the entire time and honestly made us feel a bit uncomfortable, he judged some of our food orders, very aggressively kept insisting on more drink and food orders, etc. our average food and drink order per person was almost $50. I noticed a manger walk over at one point, looked at the AC vent drip and quickly walked away without saying anything."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The 4 stars is only because of the wait!

Getting there early is definitely reccomend to get your choice of meats. As for the food itself, the brisket is as amazing as everyone says that it is. It is the perfect level of tenderness, and the bark from the rub is excellent. The ribs are melt in your mouth tender and easily bite right off the bones. The pulled pork is succulent and is made even better with Franklin's Espresso barbecue sauce. The turkey is moist, but compared to the other meats, it's just ok. As for the sides and desserts, the cole slaw is a perfect cold creamy balance to all of the rich barbecue meats. The beans are spicy, but perfectly cooked and are made even better by the burnt brisket ends that are part of the recipe. The potato salad is too much dill pickel flavor for my personal tastes, but I'm sure most people would enjoy it. As for the pies, the Bourbon Banana is delicious and definitely represents both flavors very well. My pie had at lest a half dozen slices of fresh banana in the filling.

We ordered calamari and crab ragoons as an appetizer and both were very bland. There was no seasoning on the calamari (AT ALL) and it seemed like they were just hoping the dipping sauces would save the dish. It didn't. My family and I really enjoy sushi and have it at least 3-4 times a month. We could tell right away it is nothing compared to the other restaurants we've had in the past. The pickled ginger tasted like it was expired, the rice was soggy, and it took us about 2 minutes to chew a roll because it was SO chewy. The sashimi was NOT fresh AT ALL and the consistency of the wasabi was soft and watery. When we tried to explain our experience to the waitress, she kept walking away and laughing as we spoke to her. When we received the bill, there was a gratuity charge when we only had 4 people. Mind you; we were still going to pay the bill and include gratuity.

I was getting a mediocre pizza buffet at a dated location.  So I didn't come in with particularly high or strong expectations.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was standard Mr. Gatti's.  Great if your taste buds stopped maturing in the fourth grade. But otherwise, there are better (and quite honestly, cheaper) frozen pizza options out there.  The pasta? A watery runny mess.  Again, there are better frozen food options for spaghetti and meat sauce. (Heck, the Marie Callender's frozen dinner is better AND comes with a serviceable piece of garlic toast.) The one moderately appetizing thing was the apple pie pizza.  But it's impossible to get $10.80 (buffet, drink, and tax) worth of apple pie pizza without being placed on an IV drip of insulin.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself needs a joint visit from Mr. Gatti's management and the health department.  I managed to find the only table that was clean.  And by clean, I mean that didn't have piles of plates with leftover food on it. And since Yelp is a family friendly website and makes it through most filtering software at work, I won't go into details about the men's room.  Just suffice it to say that we might've found out where several Middle East dictatorships were storing their weapons of mass destruction.  In other words, truck stop bathrooms are cleaner and more fragrant.  On the note of nastiness, the fountain drink area looked nasty with piles of ice filling the grating below the ice dispenser.\\n\\nAnd now let's discuss the buffet experience itself.  The lady who was managing the buffet was very nice and promised pizzas would be \\"out shortly.\\"  And she was right about that.  Several pizzas came out in batches. But the crowds of work crews there circled the buffet and it was like a feeding frenzy on Shark Week.  The fountain drinks were also broken, necessitating them serving drinks from 2 liter bottles left by the silverware.\\n\\nI'm not expecting a five-star experience when I go to a pizza buffet.  I do expect a clean facility with a decent variety of pizza available during the lunch rush.

I only had my little point and shoot when I visited Oakwood but boy was I excited after looking it up online. A gastropub to visit on my Vancouver trip? AWESOME. My friends and I happened to get there earlier than our reservatioin (and you DO need reservations from the sound of their voice when we said we were there early) and got seated after a little bit. Dark and focused on wood, the inside had a more upscale feel than I was expecting based on experience from American gastropubs but nothing to worry about. The food all looked great, and I started off my evening with a pint of Hoyne Dark Matter beer.\\n\\nAt the table we pretty much tried to share everything, so two appetizers came out first. They were the Fried Octopus ($10 - bacon aioli, pickled shallots, komatsuna) and All Canadian Poutine ($10 - brisket, fries, curds, gravy). After all, I have to have poutine if I'm in Canada right? The octopus was actually a bit on the overcooked side which the fried-ness seemed to try and hide. I really enjoyed what it was coated in but it was hard to think of these as anything but thick, stale octopus strips. However, the poutine was fabulous (albeit close to erring on the too salty side) with thick curds and thick fries.\\n\\nAgain, like I said, my pictures really don't do the food justice. Entrees were the Duck Cannelloni ($24 - sweet cranberry puree, shaved foie gras, fried sprouts, bechamel) and Seared Gnocchi ($18 - truffle gratine, wild mushrooms, tomato basil sauce). Frankly, my picture of the cannelloni makes it look utterly disgusting but it was quite the opposite. The foie gras was shaved so finely that it melted in my mouth (foie \\"snow,\\" anyone?) and the duck deliciously tender. The gamey-ness that people often dislike about duck was not to be found in this great plate. I could have done without the heaps of bechamel though just because the rest was already good. What I actually thought was the best dish of the night was not what I even ordered but someone else did - the seared gnocchi was a pleasant surprise. I had not even thought of searing gnocchi before but something about adding a little char to that potato flour gave it a speckled look but enormous flavor. Wild mushrooms with truffle gratine sealed the deal and had me wanting to order a whole cast iron pan for myself.

There were four couples in the restaurant including us.  They brought us to the table without menus and had to go back to get them.  Water was ok.  We looked over the menu, no biggie.  Put our menus down and waited and waited.  Mind you it was not really busy.  We ordered Saag with goat, and Kolambu was not Mutton, it was goat and both were pretty spicy.  I like hot, that was not the problem.  The menu did not indicate spiciness.   Another couple complained they were missing part of their order and they had been there an hour.  If we had heard that before we ordered, we would have left like the couple that sat down 20 minutes after us.  Food had good flavor, just obviously reheated.  Will not go back.  Not even if you paid.  I told them twice we needed containers.  BTW pay up front, they won't bring ticket and won't tell you to pay up front.   But they will bring you plenty of water.

He followed it up with a grey hound that was mostly vodka but she turned it into two drinks at the dinner table. So I was expecting this place to ya e amazing good but I can honestly say out of the thousands of restaurants I have been to the rigatoni with the crumbled sausage was hands down the best thing I have ever eaten.

A little random. Also penne, gnocchi or fettuccini with marinara or Alfredo are included. I ate spinach and blue cheese bc I didn't care for the rest of the options.

What in the world is a pallookaville? I googled it and the first thing that came up was this definition. \\"N. a place characterized by stupidity or dullness\\" Well, after having been to lunch at the place on this fine, sunny afternoon, I can tell you one fact. it is anything but!\\n\\nFOOD\\nThe corndog is the star of the show here.  Although the size makes it a little unwieldy (I wouldn't order it if I was on a date, not exactly the most attractive thing to try to eat.), it was quite spectacular! Very odd for a corn dog to be a restaurant's signature dish, but it really works. You get to choose your meat (beef frank, keilbasa, italian sausage, all 3 [yikes!]). Then you choose your cornbread coating (original, pepper, or cheese). Wanting to try something different, I ordered the kielbasa with pepper. It was cooked to perfection and the coating was crisp. Really, the perfect corn dog. Then I ordered the poutine tots (tater tots smothered in gravy plus cheese curds). I had never had poutine before, so I was excited to try it. And it was also good, although the dish needed some salt and pepper.  Overall, a little on the heavy side, but the perfect lunch. Left feeling full, which you always want in a restaurant.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE + SERVICE\\nWhen you enter Pallookaville, you are greeted with the most charmingly bizarre decor. Think 50's nostalgia meets carnival. It's not a big dining area so it is very lively and busy from the minute you enter. Eating alone, I walked up to the bar and sat up there. Had to wait a little while and I was a little lost for a few moments, but then the bartender introduced himself and the other two bartenders, which I thought was a very nice gesture.The whole time I couldn't stop staring at all the decorations. They have two full cases on a far wall of antiques and the walls are covered with whimsical humor. For example, the shake machine, seemingly right out of a 50's drug store, had a sign that said \\"Science at work. This is a splatter zone. Bringing all the boys to the yard.\\" I had a good laugh and then I ordered, feeling good about the meal.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come back here again. It was very tasty and they have a seemingly endless amount of options and variety to their menu. Also, pretty reasonable prices. I think it was great for lunch, but I've heard it gets crowded so I would advise not going at a peak time.

The service was fantastic! I had the ribs and the jalapeno sausage. My boss had the ribs, regular sausage and the brisket. My sausage was good. Ut the ribs were missing something. The meat fell of the  bone. Some of you will wonder what's wrong with that. Let me tell you what's wrong: being from a BBQ city, when meat is smoked, the meat is on the bone in a good way. This wasn't that. It was also a fatty. The fires okra was nice though. I'm not a fan of the sauce. Way too sweet for me. I have seen the Stubbs sauce in the store and never realized that it was a restaurant. I can say that I have had Texas BBQ and well, maybe I will try someplace else before we leave.

The butter was made by the restaurant and it was a great addition to the salad.\\nThe third course was my favorite. It was some sort of shrimp curry with deep fried rice. This course had a little kick to it which made it perfectly balance with the cilantro lime sauce. I won't lie by the time we got to the fourth meal I was very full.

About 5min later a man grabs 2 menus and approaches us - \\"Hi we have reservations for 7:30\\" ... man puts down menus tells us \\"Ok it will be 10 min\\". Wait... what...?? the restaurant was half empty. He was about to seat us. But because we had reservations we had to wait... who does that?? Ok so we wait. Walk ins come in and are seated ahead of us. At 7:30pm the 'host' just kinda stands there... A bunch more people arrive. They get seated. We are sitting in a plain view of the host in a half empty restaurant on a Friday night... We get up and head for the door - this has been weird and everything had a strange vibe. The \\"host\\" yells \\"Have a nice day!\\" wtf? He's happy we are leaving? I don't know what the deal was.

I asked her if the order was missed or if it's a long wait. She tried to deflect the question. I threatened to leave without paying as the food is now 30 minutes late. She finally confessed that they missed the order and she went to look for a manager. The manager got our order bumped to the top and the sashimi came only for it to again be a portion of the order and missing toro sashimi. We asked the waitress and she said: \\"they just ran out\\". We put in a total order of 20 pieces of Toro across 2 orders and got 3 pieces for the evening. The dinner was much longer than needed and we had to leave. As I was looking to get the bill, there was no wait staff available, a few even waved but never came.

The platter was served with a thick slice of bread, as well. The meats were the stars of the meal with the smoked turkey being really tasty and the chopped beef served in a rich, BBQ sauce. The mashed potatoes were nothing better than something you would get out of an instant packet and the cole slaw was runny and lacked any real flavor.

The fried green tomatoes were fabulous and the she-crab soup was possibly the best I have ever had. I also highly recommend the \\"South City Cosmo\\" which is actually a pomegranate martini and did not disappoint. My boyfriend had the fried chicken and was satisfied with it (man with few words...), but the lobster mac and cheese was not as exciting as it sounded (possibly b/c it was mixed with the mashed potatoes on the plate underneath the fried chicken?).

That dude was a genius because doing it that way kicked the whole meal up a couple of notches for me. Their country Gravy is cracktastic and those cheesy grits were so good.

I went through the third party vendor they use for online ordering and while the third party vendor provided a discount off of any future order with their partnered restaurants they reported back to me that the shop advised they would not be discounting the order or offering any apology for the poor order, as they \\"always prepare everything the same way\\" except, they don't, because sometimes it's great and some times, it feels like a real waste of money. Kind of a shame too, I would likely order more often with them if they weren't so hit and miss.

Don't get me wrong, I lurrrve living in Hawthorne/Sunnyside (see purchase of the purple Craftsman albatross in a down market) but as I watch the brutal hand of Darwinian evolution at work where new & old businesses alike prosper & flounder like flotsam bobbing in the waves I can't help but think, \\"Why?\\"  Walking by some of the new additions to the neighborhood two thoughts come to mind, \\"Would the culinary version of the Emperor's New Clothes be dubbed the Emperor's New Spice Rack?\\" & \\"Prohibition is now, erm, trendy?\\"  I suspect some of the popularity results from proximity, being in the heart of the business strip on Belmont, as well as the fact that PDXers will tolerate almost anything if booze is involved, even $14 martinis outside of the Pearl district cuz vodka & vermouth are more expensive when accompanied by exposed brick, no?  \\n\\nWhich brings me to my conundrum, why is it that a friendly, reasonably priced place that serves delicious rustic Italian food is emptier than Paris Hilton's r√©sum√©?  After walking by this brightly lit & empty eatery repeatedly while on pooch patrol we finally stopped in after perusing the menu & having a random guy walk & by tell us that they have great sandwiches.  Well, he's right, the sammiches are magnifico.

All that & crispety matchstick fries for $9 resulting in 2 delectable meals for me & my microstomach (translation: a generous meal for a dainty girl & a nice mealet for you growing boys out there).  Capt Hook satisfied his calzone craving with the Milano: savory housemade Italian sausage, fresh mozarella & grilled onions floating in a delicate marinara sauce wrapped in a flaky crust for $8.  Yum.  Did I mention that it's also a bakery?  They make their own bread for sammies as well as finger licking desserts with a lot of gratuitous moaning thrown in for good measure.  The bittersweet chocolate hazelnut shortbread cookies are enough to incite spontaneous outbreaks of song or at least a sonnet or two & easily worth the $1/buttery cookie or $2.50 for 3 cookies (hey, there's gluttony & then there's sheer hedonism, ya know?).\\n\\nAs for the ambiance?  It's so clean & bright inside this small 8ish table space that you could perform appendectomies in the blink of an eye.  A bit on the stark side given how super nice the staff (who are also your cooks) are & homey the food is but I suspect that's more related to the relative newness of the space & a simplified approach rather than any surgical aspirations.  Our sammies were made to order & crisped in the oven & were so scrumptious that mine even tasted finger sucking good the next day cold & straight out of the refrigerator (yes, I'm a philistine & no, I'm not still stuck in the iron age).  My next plan of attack besides snarfling as many cookies & cannolis as possible involves a stromboli (how can you say no to the Romano: chicken, roasted garlic, caramelized onions, provolone & pecorino for $8?), maybe a pasta (hello Baked Ziti, my name is Cam & I like French pop & snowshoeing) & a Twister¬Æ mat (don't ask & I won't tell).  For those of you who are card carrying members of the PDX brunch cult, they serve brunch from 9-4 on the weekends & it must be pretty darn good since that's the only time I've seen them busy.  So for those of you who think that blood orange & anise are a match made in heaven [shudder.], the Emperor's New Spice Rack further west down Belmont will be right up your alley.  Me?  I'll be rooting around the pastry case & inhaling anything laced with marinara like a crazed truffle pig."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"5 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I had my lunch at the location inside Hardvard University Campus.

Ramen Tatsuya is always this first place  that people say when asking about ramen in the Austin area, and with good reason.  \\n\\nThe place:\\nThere are two locations in Austin. They are each located in the north and south so you wont have to drive across the entire city to get to one. The style of the place is really vibrant and loud both in decor and ambiance. And if you get there during one of their rushes, which are common,  you will have ample time to take in the scenery.  Seating follows the design of traditional ramen houses so there are few tables for groups and limited seating over all. \\n\\nThe service:\\nTatsuya is well known as being the go to spot for ramen so that creates a big demand that translates into long lines for the rush hour times up to 1hr long. Becuse of this the servers are quick and efficient but very chill and polite. Your only real interaction with them is while your ordering your food at the counter and when they deliver it to your assigned seat. \\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nTonkatsu Original.\\nI've ordered the tonkatsu ramen every time I go and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The broth is very creamy with a beautiful pork taste although for haters of salt it may be a tad bit salty. The noodles are thin and dense with a good texture rather than soft noodles you typically get. The chashu pork is very tender and tasty which is why I commonly get extra. The Egg is boiled just to set and the yolk soaks up all that flavor. The mushrooms and other toppings then combine to balance out the while flavor profile. It is a large bowl. I will always finish every drop but you will end up full with one bowl.  \\n\\nSliders.\\nWe got the sliders one time to share and they were very delicious. The sauce pairs really well with the sweet roll and the beef. If you want a different bite from a ramen place get an order if these \\n\\nBayzilla .\\nThis is their in house cocktail which is thai basil seed lemonade with sake. It's a really refreshing drink and if you enjoy the taste of sake this cocktail will definitely satisfy you.  \\n\\n\\nFinal thoughts: \\nUnless you have a grand to spend on a ticket to Japan you will not find a better and more hip place to enjoy a hot bowl of ramen in the ATX.

With the Groupon we got one starter, a mixed greens salad, two entrees, and a dessert.\\n\\nFor our starter we decided to go with the lamb meatballs. Though the meatballs were not as tender as some that I have had in the past, the flavor of the lamb was very prevalent and paired well with the mint, spicy jam, and lingonberry.\\n\\nThe mixed greens salad was good--nothing special and a bit small for the price, but very fresh.\\n\\nFor the entrees we both ordered the Miso-sake glazed haddock. We both really enjoyed this dish as the chutney the was served over the haddock was absolutely delicious. In addition, the crunch of the snap peas and the tempura really made for a tasty bite. That being said though the snap peas were good, they did not have much additional flavor to them.\\n\\nFor dessert, we decided to split an order of the blueberry jamboree at the suggestion of our waiter. This dish was actually a lot better than I was expecting. While relatively simple, the ingredients really came together well and it ended up being the perfect ending to the meal.\\n\\nOverall, this place serves up some good food and has some interesting fusion ideas. I was surprised that this place wasn't a little more full when we arrived around 7pm, as we were able to enjoy our dinner on the outside patio--which was perfect on a warm night. Luckily for us, we came here with a Groupon, so the value was pretty good, but I think that there are a couple of items that are a bit overpriced, especially the haddock ($28). In addition, I couldn't help but notice that our waiter seemed to be super friendly to other tables, while barely making any eye contact with either me or my friend. Not sure if this was the \\"Groupon treatment\\" or whatnot, but it was pretty apparent. Nevertheless, there was also a friendly waitress who filled our waters and checked in on us several times to see how our meal was going, which was a very nice touch."},{"name":"Adesso Pizzeria","address":"385 Crossing Dr, Ste 105","city":"Lafayette","stars":"4","text":"Ordered on delivery from GrubHub.

I have been to Stubb's for an outdoor concert, two indoor concerts, and for their famous Gospel brunch. I saw Andrew Bird in concert here and learned that the outdoor space is a lot bigger than it appears-- there's plenty of space for a grand performance (standing only), complete with concessions and vendors. The two indoor concerts that I saw were: Ben Cina and Charlie Belle (check them both out!!). On the lower level there's standing room and a few bar tables-- very loud as you're closer to the speakers downstairs, but the sound quality in the building is good overall. The second floor is the larger seating area with a separate sectioned off dining area, and also a balcony overlooking the stage. There is limited seating near the balcony, but you can hear the band from anywhere upstairs. The gospel brunch was quite a treat! They have a large spread of various brunch buffet options, including a carving station of sausage, brisket and chicken; and all of the food is pretty good. Check out the gospel brunch at least once-- the downstairs seating arrangement is very tight, but sitting close to the band is very entertaining. The cover band that we saw on that Mother's Day (Sunday) was called Kings of Harmony Plus One. One of the downsides of this place is that they only have one restroom and it's downstairs; so if you're dining upstairs, that can be a bit of an inconvenience. However, they do have a changing table in the lady's restroom, mamas; so there's that."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My family visited Universal this past weekend and ate lunch at the Cowfish.

A definite recommendation.\\n\\nChowder: Jake's really does their seafood well; this chowder was wonderful! Nice and thick -- not watery like a lot of places. Great tasting clams without reminding you of the ocean floor.\\n\\nBlackened Chicken Sandwich: This has a bite of spice to it but we all love some zing. Very good.\\n\\nService is hit or miss. We started at the bar since we had a larger party and all the tables were taken. Our server was so friendly and awesome, we loved her. We then moved when a table cleared and the new server was angry, not polite and not attentive. This hit or miss service is what knocked down my rating. Aside from that it's a great experience for dining and HH. All in all, I love the vibe (esp this time of the year, very Christmasy with a lot of old fashioned wood tones). \\n\\nLet me also add that their Brunch is pretty awesome! $3 Mimosas and a fantastic selection, wonderfully prepared.

Zabu chicken's ratings were average so I was hesitant on trying it but it did not disappoint. \\n\\nWe got there at 5PM on a Saturday and got the last table available. Be prepared to wait or sit on the terrace outside if you arrive past that time. We were sat however at the table closest to the entrance, and since the waiters had to serve the tables on the terrasse, the door was kept open and we were freezing the whole time.\\n\\nI'm usually pretty lenient on the service but I can see why other reviewers were pretty pissed off at it. They were obviously understaffed, and all the waitresses were running around and multi-tasking like crazy. You won't get your water refilled unless you ask for it. But at least you get what you ask for. \\n\\nWhat makes up for all this though is the chickeeen! O-M-G that chicken. Done right from every aspect. Every piece was full of chicken and just the right amount of fat and breading. Every piece was evenly cooked, crispy and tender. All the chicken wing pieces are the middle segment which is universally considered the best portion. My favorite flavours are the soy and spicy ones. The soy one is not too salty and has a hint of sweet that makes it so much tastier. The spicy one's not just spicy, but also flavourful, which is hard to achieve with spicy chicken. On top of that, the portions are huge! One whole chicken is definitely enough to fill two people. \\n\\nOverall, sure, there are aspects that could be improved in this experience, but the chicken makes up for them completely and I would definitely return."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Service: 0 Stars.

I can assure you that you probably won't be the first or only ones in line. However, this will save you at least 30-60 minutes of waiting if you miss the first wave of seating.\\n\\nThe food is southern style comfort food, and the portions are very generous. They're best known for their fried chicken and waffles and the praline bacon, so those 2 items are a must order.\\n\\nThe fried chicken was pretty good. It had a bit of a cajun seasoning and kick to it, and the meat was moist and tender. However, the batter wasn't very crispy and it struggled to remain adhered to the chicken. The waffle is a sweet potato variety and is very soft and fluffy. It's not soggy and does a great job serving as a base for the extremely large pieces of chicken placed on top.\\n\\nThe praline bacon is smoked bacon caramelized with crusted toasted pecans, brown sugar & a hint of cayenne seasoning. The pecans and brown sugar add sweetness to the bacon without making it inedible, but overpower the cayenne. The bacon itself is long strips and not crispy, which is probably required for the pecans to stick to it.\\n\\nThe buttermilk biscuits and gravy with country sausage gravy was amazing. The gravy is thick, rich, creamy and meaty. The biscuits are good in their own right, but the gravy is definitely the star of the show. It's fantastic that the kitchen completely drenches the biscuits with the gravy, and we ended up asking for even more on the side.\\n\\nThe blueberry & lemon curd buttermilk pancakes were a bit of a disappointment. I guess they weren't able to source fresh blueberries yet and were still relying on the dried variety. These were shriveled and not bursting with flavor. The pancakes themselves were a bit on the denser side."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I wasn't terribly happy with my food.

My sister got the crab soup and crab cake (yes I said cake not cakes) which came to about 20 dollars also. The crab cake alone was 15 dollars, when we inquired about the size of the cake we were told it would be large. It was roughly the size of my hand and I don't have big hands. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very stylish and our waitress was a complete professional. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the extremely small bathroom.

Magical miracle meat...yeah, that's what this BBQ should be called. I'm going to have to write  Aaron Franklin to thank him for getting my kid to eat something besides Mac n cheese. Now, I'm serious about BBQ....real serious. I mean get up at 4 am and get in line for 6-7 am, wait for 4 hours...serious. This is exactly what I did. I was at the head of the line but was not the first one (there were about 10 people ahead of me)so clearly I'm not the only one this serious (or crazy...depending on how you look at it..ha) about BBQ. Was it worth it...uh, yeah. Would I do it again...maybe. The experience was great. It was nice just talking to people and enjoying each other's company. The time actually went by faster than I thought. One of the guys that I was talking to had gone through this 3 times and said he'd gladly do it again. This isn't for the faint at heart but if you're up for it, it's something that you should try at least once. Oh yeah, let me not forget the staff...some of the nicest people. They are so patient, kind and helpful. They definitely make the experience that much better!! Overall, this is some great Q. Mr. Aaron Franklin is definitely worthy of every accolade that he has gotten. Thank you Franklin BBQ for GREAT FOOD, fellowship and fun."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you wanna come here for brunch, you better come when it opens or you'll be waiting for over an hour!

The fried chicken was fantastic! The flavor and crunch on that skin had me falling in love all over again. The chicken itself was super juicy and tender. Even though it was breast meat, it was still moist, so I was really impressed. As for the waffle, I was indifferent. It was fluffy and what you expect from a waffle, but I guess I'm not a huge waffle person. The french toast, however, was AMAZING! Bananas were caramelized perfectly. The flavored whipped cream was a really nice touch. The caramel sauce that the french toast was laying on really took it home. The toast was fluffy and moist. Everything about it was awesome!

These people are not fools, nay, they are individuals on the road to enlightenment of what protein can be in all its smokey goodness.\\n\\nThe brisket is legend and is keystone of this establishment but DO NOT discount the smoked turkey, sausage, or any other delicious confections. Although the sauce is good, the meat does not need it. Enjoy the savory bark, the heavily peppered rub, the lovely smoke ring, the fat that literally melts in you mouth. Just appreciate the fact the meat can be clarified and taken to this level of divinity. \\n\\nTo prove this point further, try this: Order a few ribs. Pick a rib up by the bone and hold it vertically so the rib dangles down towards you plate. Now shake the rib lightly and watch the meat literally fall off the bone onto your plate. Now that's tender. No tricks, no games, no smoke and mirr-- okay well a lot of smoke actually. \\n\\nTo be frank (see what I did there?) this place does not need my review. It's reputation as a pillar of Austin and Texas food culture is well grounded and won't be dipping below five stars in this lifetime.

When the prime rib came out to the table it was not medium rare but medium to medium well. When this was brought to the servers attention she handled it appropriately and went to the chef and management. We were told by management that we were not able to get it cooked differently because they refused to cut into a different roast. If we were told that we could not get the roast cooked medium rare from the beginning when the kitchen would have received that order and then knowing they were not able to meet their customers request, they should have informed us and we would have gotten a different meal. My father in law ended up eating only the small amount of shrimp that came with the order and ended up leaving hungry. The manger proceeded to tell him that she will not be charging him for the roast, well Id sure hope not!

I've tried to come back a few times since the first time I went here and the wait is over an hour long at times. And when you have Newbury St next store you could take phone numbers down for reservations and let people at least walk around and call when you are ready. I watched myself and quite a few other small parties walk out because of this inconvenience. To stand around the small venue and wait for an hour is just a lot.

Since the restaurant is so giant, you actually may not have issue with reservations but I made them for me and 4 friends on Sun around 12.

I loved it!\\n\\nEden Burger is a very simple restaurant in Columbus, OH located on High Street just a few blocks from THE Ohio State University (GO BUCKS!).  The menu is small with various vegan burgers, as well as vegan sides and drinks.\\n\\nI chose their \\"Special\\" which was \\"The Takeout\\" but in a wrap.  It was a tempeh burger tossed in general tso sauce with lettuce, broccoli-carrot slaw and wasabi aioli.  It was delicious and very filling.  I also ordered their vegan mozzarella sticks which were bangin' (that means good), as well as their mango lemonade which I could have drunk all day!\\n\\nAs mentioned, the establishment is very small with a few chairs and tables but there's a large patio on the side for warm evenings.  The noise level was high because there's a bar next door with an attached window for orders but hey, it's High Street and OSU, so noise should be expected.\\n\\nParking was a challenge.  There's a small parking lot alongside of the building but you must navigate down alleys in order to reach it - it can't be accessed from High Street.  Also there's quite a bit of construction going on in that area.  The staff was friendly and all items were explained thoroughly.

You order at the line as soon as you come in the door and sit at long benches (which you share), with the exception of a few cut off tables. \\n\\nWhen ordering, there's only a few options for breakfast that all seem to consist of some sort of biscuit dish. After being greeted by the cashier, i was also greeted by a signed picture of Guy Fieri, who visited for an episode of his show--so I guess that was cool. I ordered the Se7vn Benedict based on suggestion (basically an egg cooked medium, tomato, bacon, in between a biscuit topped with butter/garlic mix? Read the menu.)\\n\\nOverall, the establishment was very nice and welcoming. The employees were attentive and asked a few times if they could get us anything else. As for the food, it was a little much for me. I like a good breakfast biscuit sandwich, but this one was just a little overboard with the excess garlic topping. I try to eat healthier, so maybe that's why I was getting the feeling I get when I eat fast food (kind of greasy). Nevertheless, I finished my food. My friends seemed to enjoy it much more than I did.\\n\\nWe came at brunch so I saw some of the lunch menu and I would probably come back to try that.

I have worked in the food industry and have visited most of the most popular restaurants in the Portland area. One thing I understand about the restaurant business, is you are never going to be able to please all people with your menu, everyone has different tastes and opinions. The one thing restaurant owners can control is the service and value of what you serve! I have been to relish many times, over the years they have been open, I love the outdoor seating and I have had some food from the menu, I would rate as good to very good, however the one place, in my opinion? they are missing the boat! is in their service  and value you of what they serve. I find their staff, not overly friendly, for a neighborhood restaurant, lacking in food and drink knowledge and inconsistent in food, wine and drink portions. If you go to a restaurant and receive friendly and attentive service and your food is not up to par, your patrons are more likely to come back, giving you the benefit of the doubt, good service will trump good food. It's nice when both are great, your clients are more  likely to come back, however, bad or unfriendly service, will usually make good food, not so good. Consistency of the Hostess, your first contact with the customer will set the tone for the meal, friendly encounter puts patrons at ease. I know it's hard to find good staff, don't expect to find knowledgeable and friendly staff, they need to be trained and in formed. The Ringside Restaurant in Portland, is one of the most expensive restaurants in Portland area, a bill for two people can  exceed $200 with no drink or wine, they also have service and knowledge, over the top, many times two to three servers waiting on you, many times steaks are not as ordered, however, how they handle these issues, \\"the customer is always right\\" what can we do to make their evening a success. Great service, trying to do their best with management that supports what they do. I will be back to Relish, I want them to succeed, hopefully they will !"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Very cool interior with delicious ramen.

The outer rim of the plate was lined with full thinly sliced prosciutto, roasted eggplant and zucchini, marinated mushrooms and red peppers, fresh mozzarella, black and green olives with balsamic drizzle.   A little salty for my taste but all fairly good.\\n\\nIt didn't seem like they were in a rush to have us leave as it took some time before our waiter came over to take our dinner orders. She reviewed the available ingredients and we chose:  veal Marsala over homemade fusilli pasta (me), veal and chicken pesto over linguine (hubby) and swordfish and shrimp diavolo with a side of mixed grilled vegetables (friend).  Spinach was not available and that would have been her first choice.\\n\\nAbout 20-minutes passed between finishing our appetizers before our entrees arrived and the 5 pm dinner crowd began flowing in (mostly parties of 6 or more).   Each time the door opened, a rush of cold air came in so we were thankful to have been sitting at the opposite end of the door but it was still noticeable when the door opened.\\n\\nThe chicken and veal in the pesto dish was VERY tender and the hubby thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great pesto taste per him (I'm not a big fan of pesto).  The veal in the Marsala dish was thin so some pieces were very tender and others were fair.  Light Marsala sauce but the taste of the wine was still present, fair portion of fusilli and fresh mushroom slices.  Our friend was very satisfied with the swordfish and shrimp portion as well as the mixed vegetables. Pieces of the swordfish were very tender and some tasted a little overcooked.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, red peppers) were cooked perfectly but in a lot of oil.  She had enough for a doggie bag.\\n\\nBecause there's no menu, you have no idea the cost of your meal ...which was a curiosity of our friend throughout the meal.  We skipped dessert as we were very full so when the tab arrived, we were pleased with the prices of our entrees - $26.95 for seafood, $21.95 each for the Marsala and pesto but the appetizers were rather high - $2.50 per meatball and $7.95 per person for the antipasto ...so almost $32 for appetizers.  \\n\\nQuality of appetizers:  3.  Price:  1\\nQuality of entrees:  4 - 4.5.   Price:   3\\nService:  3.  \\nAmbience:  3\\nLocation:  4.

Maybe it's because I didn't like their Apple Old Fashioned (what was I thinking, apple and old fashioned just don't sound right together!).

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I feel a bit schizophrenic about No Mas, or maybe more like the nursery rhyme about the girl with curl-- \\"when she was good, she was very good, but when she was bad, she was horrid.\\" There are some things about this place that I really like, then some things... not so much. It's actually even hard to give it a star rating as I feel polarizingly different about the service (crappy!) and the decor (cool), as well as the food (tasty) and the drinks (lacking).\\n\\nThe pros:\\nThe decor and atmosphere of the restaurant are actually quite bright and colorful. The restaurant itself is huge, with lots of multi-sized tables... mind you, I've been here as a party of two and most recently, with 16 people, and have always been comfortable.  Additionally, they have an ice cream/coffeeshop and an art gallery/shop on the property, and stylish. the food has always been pretty good, though definitely not the best Mexican food I've ever had. However, the service has always been a bit questionable.\\n\\nThe cons:\\nOh, the service. Last time I was there as part of a celebratory work party, planned at the last minute. Unsure of how many people would be attending, we told the host we probably needed room for at least ten. It was way early and the restaurant was practically empty but the host said he \\"wouldn't seat us until the whole party was there.\\" As we didn't know how many and when the rest of our party would arrive, we decided that we'd just have to take our business elsewhere. And then magically, there was room for 12 and another 4 top that we could grow into if needed. So weird. And the drinks are just as awkward... they've obviously invested in the presentation of their pricey margaritas (as they're served in these beautiful tall carafes), but not their contents. They taste like tequila mixed with kool-aid and cheap sour mix. Ick.\\n\\nAs much as I love my after work drink and value good service, I'm not sure the \\"good\\" things are enough to outweigh the \\"horrid.\\""},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to Texas de Brazil last time, and we are kicking ourselves for wasting time and money on this place.

We were a party of 2 and waited about 45 minutes, pretty much exactly what the hostess promised, and there was ample (albeit cramped) seating in the front area of the restaurant. Overall, it's a tightly-knit space with a long bar along the left and tables (mostly for 2-4 people, so don't come with a massive group) along the right.\\n\\nOnce seated, we ordered the gruyere mac and cheese, the minted snap peas, and the large dark (two thighs, two legs, a biscuit, and two sauces). The mac and cheese was heavenly, creamy and rich and just a little spicy, fairly reminiscent of the mac and cheese at Buttermilk and Bourbon in downtown Boston. The minted snap peas were fresh and crisp, very high quality produce for the end of the season, and a great counterpoint for the comparatively heavier food we ordered. The fried chicken was good -- the breading was tasty although just a smidge soggy in places and the meat inside was generally pretty moist and flavorful, although parts of it were a little dry. The biscuit was solid as well -- the honey butter was a solid accompaniment, although not quite as good as the biscuits and honey butter found at Sweet Cheeks. Overall, weirdly, my favorite thing was the gochujang ketchup, which was tomato-y and sweet and spicy, just a great sauce to go with the chicken.\\n\\nOur bill ended up being $41 after tax and tip for 2. Service was fast and friendly, and the drink list did look interesting although we abstained. They're still early days, so their dessert menu was a bit light -- just s'mores and ice cream -- but hopefully that will expand in the coming weeks.\\n\\nOverall, worth a visit. Not the best fried chicken I've had in the greater Boston area, and if you're not up for the 30-minute drive plus wait from Boston proper, you could probably get similarly awesome food at Sweet Cheeks or Coast Cafe, but still -- quite a fun place with a great vibe!"},{"name":"Sweet Tomatoes Pizza","address":"320 Chestnut St","city":"Needham","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a firm believer in customer service.

They recommend a 1/2 pound of brisket per person- which we got & it was definitely the best meat we had! We also did a 1/4 lb of pulled pork, sausage (1 link), and 1/2 pound of ribs (so we each could have 1 rib). We also got a side of coleslaw and potato salad.  The sides were good, but an afterthought compared to the meat.  As soon as we got to the front of line, they had a sample of the brisket on the counter. OMG.  After 2 hours waiting on an empty stomach, that first bite was heavenly.  We did also ask for part of our brisket to be burnt ends and we fortunate to be at the end of brisket- they were by far the best part!

On that particular day, we woke up at 6:45, looked outside, and spotted pouring rain and 31 degree weather.... yep we agreed to abandon ship. This morning I woke up at 6:30, scoped the weather channel, looked outside, and decided that unless it dipped below 40 degrees today, Franklin's was happening.\\n\\nWell it appeared that the wet, chilly weather had deterred most of the other people who would normally be waiting early in line because when we drove up at 8:30AM we claimed a spot in the official lot and were 4th/5th ish in line. WHOO HOOO!!!! We then waited 2.5 hours for them to open. It wasn't a bad experience, we got to meet and chat with some veterans who had done multiple Franklin line waits and they gave us tips on what to try. \\n\\nRegardless, once the store opened we had our food in about 25 minutes. Here's my only gripe about Franklin's. I was fully aware of the 3 hour wait before the store opened but since we were so far ahead in line, I didn't anticipate the additional 25 minute wait. The issue was that there was one person cutting ALL the orders, large and small. We had two people in front of us who placed large orders (one person had around 25 lbs of meat). What I didn't understand was that if you had such a large order why not just call it in? I just feel like if there was a smaller cutting station that handled obscenely large orders, such as that one, the line for actually ordering food would move along much more smoothly. Anyway, gripe aside, at least the awesome staff at Franklin's let me try the meat cuts while I was waiting so I could further cement my decision.\\n\\nI got the moist brisket plate and OMG WAS IT AMAZING!!! It is definitely the best brisket I've had thus far (I haven't tried Snow's yet.... that's in the works). I personally have no issues waiting in long lines as long as the food at the end of the wait lives up to the hype. Franklin's totally did that. My brisket was moist, tender, juicy, and fell apart with light flaking of my fork. So delicious. With that said, the sides were mediocre; nothing to write home about. My friend got the rib and brisket platter and I had a chance to try some of the ribs. They were definitely \\"fall off the bone\\" tender. Our other friend got a pound of brisket but at the end of the meal we all agreed that the plates were slightly better deals than buying straight pounds of meat if you're dining for one. \\n\\nI will admit, I've given Rudy's 5 stars too. Why? Because when I wrote the review Rudy's was the best BBQ I had ever had. However I don't think I'd change my review. For what it is (virtually no wait time and convenient quick eating) Rudy's brisket is pretty decent. I would probably stagger them as 5 stars for convenience/wait time and 3.5-4 stars for brisket. However Franklin's staggers exactly opposite: 5 stars for food, 3.5-4 stars for the wait (mostly that weird holdup at the cutting board). So in my personal opinion they're both worth 5 stars because I believe in rounding up. \\n\\nSo, was the line long? Yes. Was it worth it? HECK YEAH! Here's the thing. At least with the 3 hour wait to get in the door of Franklin's you kind of know what you're getting into because everyone mentions it. At the end of the day, that line will lead you to some of the best brisket in the United States, so stop your bellyaching people. Go to Franklin's, wait in line, and eat the delicious brisket!"},{"name":"House of Blues Restaurant & Bar","address":"1490 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We came to this place with a group of 20.

Every time. We always get extra salad dressing and extra corn salsa that already comes mixed in the salad. Never any problems with that order--quick, simple, easy. Tonight as we were seated, we were given salsa and no chips. The chips took 17 minutes to arrive at our table after waving down a different waiter. Our waitress and the manager were standing off to the side chatting away, post seeing this interaction with the waiter, the waitress brings us the chips. \\n\\nBefore waving down the waiter we put in our order with our waitress. I asked for the same thing I always get, with the extras. She was unsure if that was something she could do which already raised a red flag, she asked her manager Michael Mitchell who instructed her, they do not give extras. We asked to speak with the manager given the shock effect of this information. Michael tells me \\" we don't give extras because I need to make sure I have enough for the night\\", it is 10:30 at night--kitchen won't be open past another hour or so anyways! Either way he dismissed it said sorry and walked away. \\n\\nWhat followed after that, was my friend receiving the wrong order and I didn't receive my appetizer before my meal--because it was never put in!

In fact, I was told that next time I wanted to order to go I should call in instead of ordering online. \\n\\nIt is 2019, we can all place an online order with a dozen other restaurants that will get it right (and care if it is wrong), so why would anyone bother with Jerry's considering they care so little about customer satisfaction that they can't even remake a simple pizza correctly; or offer a free appetizer or Cannoli on another visit to encourage me to come back and give them another try?

This kind of small personal touch shows a level of attention to detail I can definitely get down with. Everything we ate was amazing and I would definitely order it again. The major letdown was our server, when asked, said that people usually ordered 2-3 items. The menu was broken down and appeared to be a la carte. So, my friend and I each ordered 3 items each. Boy did we not need to as the portion sizes were huge! We could have easily done with ordering half the items we did and then split those which we did order. I realize some people may find this distasteful but throwing out food we don't eat seems wasteful to me. I suppose it's a matter of perspective. Also, this would definitely be considered a fine dining experience as the price tag at the end of the meal was quite expensive. I would have much rather gone here to celebrate something special than just regular dinner date. I know the critics out there will tear me apart for wanting to share my meal and complaining about the price but as a consumer I say its my money to do with as I choose.

The only food that appeared to be hot were the fries. The fish was cold, clams were cold, scallops were cold. You name it and it was cold - but not the fries.

Impossible for it to have become freezing cold in two blocks. \\n\\nIn reference to the food, not only was it cold but not was also not very good. But cold food never really is.

In fact, the 5 servers I talked to just said \\"ok\\" without even giving a glimpse at me or our table. When one other person from the party, who paid for all of us that night, gently told the manager that the wait was longer than usual and she was hoping that other customers won't have the same kind of experience, the manager responded in a pretty negligent attitude and said the kitchen is busy, so the food can come out later. \\n\\nAlso, while we were at the front to pay for our food, one of the servers, who had taken our order and was standing in front of us while the payment process was happening, spoke in Cantonese about us in a very noticeably annoyed tone to the manager. No, I don't speak Cantonese and only know a few phrases in mandarin, but as someone who has basic human sense, it felt very odd and upsetting that the server would speak in her native tongue to (very noticeably) badly talk about the customers in front of her and to defend herself in front of the manager. \\nAnother odd thing was that the same server suddenly said one \\"sorry\\" as she handed the check to us, but she never even had tried to apologize before we talked to the manager. \\n\\nWell, it could be that we just had an unlucky night, waiting for our food while 3 different parties next to us who came at different times finished their food and left and the staff forgot about our existence and food order. \\nOr it could be that the general personality of the servers and the manager is blunt. But I do know the difference between bluntness and rudeness. \\nI also wonder if our party's experience has to do with sexism and/or racism, because three of us were women of color and I was surprised to see a table of white customers being served 10 minutes after they got seated, by a server with a mildly friendly attitude (from another server who also was ignoring our table). \\nSo from now on, when I'm craving some dim sum or Chinese food, I'll look for a different place to avoid another unpleasant experience."},{"name":"Pleasantdale Chinese Restaurant","address":"3990 Pleasantdale Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I've been here several times and each time I went was always a good experience.

This place is only a block or two away from the new Atlanta Falcons Mercedes Benz stadium, the Georgia Dome and the Atlanta University Center downtown.  I popped in around lunch time on a Thursday and it was busy but not packed.  There's a lower and upper level seating area but I was flying solo today for lunch so i sat at the bar that has seating for about 25 people. On the day i had lunch, Summer was bartending.  She was cool, quick, attentive and efficient and a bit later I also found out that Summer is also the manager. I ordered quesadilla de la casa that costs $7.49.  You can have it with grilled chicken for an extra $1.50.  Summer offered the Cantinas' complimentary basket of chips and salsa while I waited for my lunch. The chips were lightly salted and crisp and the salsa was just the right amount of spicy.  If you're wanting to hydrate with something other than water,  try the classic No Mas margarita.  This ain't no premixed watered down imitation margarita. It'll cost you about $12 but you might only need just the one.  \\n\\nNo Mas Cantina is very well thought out and decorated.   There's an outside porch where customers can dine that leads to the inside host station.  They offer a variety of  food and drink choices so everyone should be satisfied, including kids.  No Mas is the American version of a authentic southwestern Mexican experience .  There are interesting pieces of art and artifacts to figure out and discuss while you dine.  There are stairs to walk up to the second level and there's also an elevator for anyone who needs it.  The food had good flavors and was also a decent size portion.   I attacked it before I photographed it soooo that should tell you something about what I think about this place. \\n\\nThe last thing I'm going to tell you is that you have to see the bar.  It looks like they reclaimed the wood and design from the 18th century and imported it here.  Dare I say...impressive.  Maybe I'm just missing London.  There are several flat screen televisions  above the bar to keep you entertained.  If you don't bring your own, you can do what I did and get off your damn phone and talk to the other losers who also couldn't get a lunch date.
