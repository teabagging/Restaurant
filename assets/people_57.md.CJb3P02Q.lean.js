The entire experience was awful and the staff were a big part of this. Long wait, water on floor, friend fell due to water on floor, management awful, cold food, no attempt to make anything right. Grisel needs major management training. Long story below but want to ensure you understand that this isn't an attempt to be mean but to provide all the details necessary.There were 5 of us who arrived about 7:00pm for dinner. We were told there was a 30 minute wait for inside and an hour wait for outside. This was a Friday night and so we expected a wait. We hadn't eaten there before and wanted to give it a try and knew other establishments would have a wait...so again, not worried about the wait. We requested a table inside since the wait was shorter.45 minutes later we went back inside to ask how much longer we would have to wait.We were told 5-10 minutes. 20 minutes AFTER that we went back in to request an ETA. I understand wait time can be considerable on a Friday but be TRUTHFUL. We could have gone to another location if we knew we would wait an hour and a half. So they finally take us to a very crowded area in the back and start pushing together 2 small tables that normally hold 2 chairs each. It was very tight. We asked if we could sit at a booth in the corner and we would add a chair to the end. The hostess said okay. We move to the booth and then she hurries over flustered and says we can't sit there it's a fire hazard. So we get up to move back to the other tables and then a waiter comes up and tells her that we need to move to another table (a group of larger tables that we had passed that were open...why didn't we sit there first?) Then as we are walking to that area my friend slips on water and falls on her hands and knees. The hostess doesn't know what to do. We have to rush to our friend to help her up. the hostess just stared. My friend shows the hostess and another waitress the water on the floor. And they start walking away. We plan events and work with risk and crisis management. So we stand there and tell the hostess someone needs to stand in the area until it's clean so nobody else will fall. So the hostess and a waitress stand there.So then we head back to our table. The waiter comes and we ask to speak to the manager. The manager was not very apologetic and didn't seem to feel like it was a big issue. We asked to complete an incident report. She brings the report and, then leaves to bring a copy after my friend completed it, and then says that she didn't see any water in the spot. What?! You have a customer fall and you show up after we SHOW your hostess and waitress and then tell us there isn't any water in the area? So then I see the hostess we spoke to and I ask the manager, Grisel, what the women's name is. She looks at me and says she can't remember, that her mind when blank. Seriously?! And again, just looks at me. So I call the hostess over and ask her name, Lauren. I then tell Grisel we showed Lauren the water and she must have cleaned it up in between her coming over, then leaving to get the incident report, then bringing it and sitting with my friend while she completed it, then she left, then she came back with a copy and told us there wasn't any water when she just looked. I'm sorry, I would expect that you would want the water cleaned up IMMEDIATELY. I called her on it and she immediately backed tracked and said she didn't mean to imply she didn't slip on water. Then it took forever for our food, and then it was cold. WE TRIED TO BE UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENT BUT THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON.

The chicken you get with the meal option is served over white bread, which is great to counteract the spice. Upon first glance, I thought the prices were a little high: $10-12 for a meal and $13 for a sandwich. But the portions are pretty big (confession: I had ZERO leftovers) and you get unlimited sweet tea with the meal.

It's a bounty of fish my husband and I love to share but the price has crept up from $40 a few years back to closer to $50.  The price jump means that sometimes it's worth a few extra bucks to go to Fugakyu instead since the fish there is even better with bigger portions.However, I like the casual atmosphere at Ginza.  My husband and I were there last year during the World Series and everyone was pretending to be interested in their fish, but when J.D. Drew hit a grand slam, the whole room erupted in cheers.

However, I went with second favorite pecan. It was just a regular one since they were also out of the Bourbon Chocolate as well that day (maybe people were all on a pie diet??)

Second time, after my friend and I gorged on burgers and beverages at RF O'Sullivans  (which just happens to be across the street) decided we needed a pie for our second round of gluttony.

We ate it without reheating and it was still good.Third time I surprised the boyfriend with a bourbon chocolate pecan pie it was good, but definitely not what I expected. It was a fudgy chocolate filling, topped with lots of pecans. Good, but very rich and more chocolate pie than pecan, but once again the boy loved it. The friend and I also shared a snickerdoodle cookie.

I started by ordering the Thai tea and if you know anything about Thai tea, it's that if it comes out already orange, it's not going to be delicious bc they used a powder to mix it. Pho With Us has Thai tea where they brewed the tea and poured in the cream so it's creamy on top and you mix it before you drink. It was the best thai tea! We also did the salt and pepper lobster, pricey but delicious. My husband got the pho with us pho which was byyyyy far! The best pho we've had in Austin, hands down. The broth was savory and there was a huge bone in his soup. Only thing I would change is the meat served on the side, I wished it was in slices and not chopped. But other than that, amazing!

The very-reliable Justin V. wrote a rather scathing review of this place's \\"BBQ\\" and I find it inescapable to say that, for the most part, I have to agree.\\nIf we can just wiggle out of needing to evaluate this place on the merits of its BBQ.... the Yelp review calls this place \\"Tennessee Red's BBQ Co\\".....whereas on the marquee outside and on the menus inside the building proper, it simply says, \\"Tennessee Red's Restaurant and Lounge.\\" This is a lot of fussing over semantics, I realize, but as you can probably tell, I'm inclined to give these nice folks the benefit of the doubt.  \\nThe thing is, as a neighborhood bar, this place is just fine. I found it it welcoming with plenty of friendliness and enthusiasm. Several Tables were devoted to a Texas Hold 'Em tourney to be held later the evening I passed through there. I found the man and wife manager duo to be highly personable.\\nAs for the victuals, well, everything about them at first blush said \\"BBQ\\"--- in fact they fairly screamed \\"BBQ\\"... when I see menus featuring meat sampler plates featuring your choice of linx, brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, chicken (breast or thigh meat), and catfish, pardon me for immediately thinking \\"BBQ! I can't wait to try it out!\\" \\nBut only a bite or two from this sampler platter revealed that this was definitely NOT BBQ--- there wasn't a trace of charcoal or wood chips or smokey, fumey heavenliness. A BBQ CSI crime tech could pinpoint what was going on here, and my gut instinct said this meat (excepting the catfish, which was decidedly UNDER- cooked in a deep fryer, and was tender but quite soggy) was all cooked in a conventional oven---and some of it possibly in a crock pot. All of the meat was supremely juicy and tender---but it was also surprisingly bland, for all that.  Were it not for the conspicuously sweet mustard and hot bbq sauces, these meats would not have much flavor to them, at all. It's times like this that I wonder w/trepidation if all those years of abusing my GI tract w/all so much habanero and Ghost pepper sauce have finally taken their toll on my ability to taste anything, anymore. Blackened stumps where my taste buds used to be isn't a bad sign, is it???\\nA special word about Tennessee Red's brisket: There must be a million or more grannies every week in this fabulous land of ours, armed w/their trusty crock-pots, that whip up shredded beef just like what you'll find @ TR's. As noted above, the beef was decidedly moist....but it was so shredded, there was no way to verify it was, in fact, brisket flesh. I'm ok w/eating bowlful after bowlful of granny's crockpot brisket, but with this there is no pretense of being something that it is NOT--to wit, BBQ. A quick word about the sides---the corn bread were so moist as to be nearly sodden; the collard greens were very good, but a definite notch or two below either Tasty and Sons or Eat. The mac and cheese was ok (definitely liked the pungent garlic bouquet). The beans were savory and rich, but you couldn't call them spicy/zesty. Overall, the sides easily out-performed the meats when judged as true bbq cuisine.\\nB/c it's not clear to me that Tennessee Reds is currently pitching themselves as a BBQ joint, I remain reluctant to penalize them for creating a perception of their wares that may NOT have been of their conscious doing. If we're talking about TR's as a general neighborhood pub w/ \\"BBQ-like substance\\", it's good---3 stars, maybe with a little change, for the nifty service. If we insist on judging this place as a BBQ competitor--- uh uh, honey, noooooo. You're not making ME do the dirty work, of throwing them under the bus. They were nice to me! Their BBQ-like substance, however it was actually cooked, was far more tender than a good many standard BBQ competitors I have tried even in the past 6 months. So 3 stars it is and hey--- until something drastic changes, let' s consider removing the \\"BBQ Co.\\" from the Yelp Review site, shall we?

Plus it came with a side of fries, but the star was definitely the crab cake.Mother's \\"macaroni & cheese\\" du jour: OMG best thing. Mac and Cheese is the epitome of comfort food, but wow. This was amazing. I can't remember what cheese were used the day we went, but the combination was great and not too heavy.

The place was pretty good. I got the eggplant torta and the sandwich was really filling (I took half home). It was an interesting take on the real tortas but one I actually enjoyed. They had a sauce which which was pretty good and went really well with the Torta. To share we got a charred avocado - I didn't really know what to expect but it's pretty much an avocado sliced in half and just charred with some sauce to garnish it. This one was a bit disappointing - i didn't get much other taste than avocado which is great but not at that price. The place is pretty large and really nice. I think it gets pretty full though around peek lunch times and we came in already with a reservation so we didn't have to wait at all. I would recommend making one if you're planning on coming in with a larger group during those peak times.

The place is really cute with wooden tables,chairs, booths, and they have the classic fish tank next to the sushi bar. Our waiter was polite but seemed rushed and annoyed that I was asking questions some food items, he also didn't ask or bring the complementary tea in til I asked him too. Since he was so impatient (it wasn't busy by the way) I ended up with an extra roll of sushi that I specifically told him I didn't want. We had 2 crazy makis and on veggie roll, veggie roll was horrible horrible horrible carrots were dry avocado was hard and the mushroom had a weird fridge taste to it....but the makis were delicious and the spicy mayo is a must! In the end we got a 30$ bill for a couple of pieces of sushi. I say 2 stars, I think their prices should be less for the food they are serving, but hey maybe some people like it that way.\\nP.S. - this place is not the best for young children,  they have high chairs but the place is small and quiet so one scream and you have the whole restaurant looking at you!"},{"name":"Lomonico's","address":"1506 Stonecreek Dr S","city":"Pickerington","stars":"4","text":"My favorite place in Pickerington for brunch and dinner!!!

I've been here for breakfast and several times for lunch so I'm not sure how dinner is, but I would give this place 5 stars if the portions were consistent on the menu according to price.Many items on the menu are delicious, but insanely overpriced for what you get. You never know how big your meal is going to be. Every time I go here my friends and I aren't exactly wow'd by the portion size. It's always the first comment. I almost always feel hungry after sharing a \\"starter\\" and having an \\"entree\\", if you could even call it that. My favorite thing is the chicken sandwich, but you can get some great similar sandwiches elsewhere in Cambridge (Roxy's, Smoke Shop), and way more satisfying and cheaper.The Little Donkey could be amazing, they just need to fix their menu and pricing to be competitive with the rest of Cambridge. There are so many great options around, and there's not much that pulls me in here. Can I at least get a filling meal under $50 please? That would be great.Edit (1 year later, 2018): my friends went here recently and they said they will never go back. I can see from their description that nothing has changed. Small portions, insanely high prices, what is usually expected is not delivered, every person in their party was starving after and had to go somewhere else, and they paid $25 per person. What???? You lost me LD. I'm amazed that the same crap is on the menu, the same mistakes made over and over again.

Mom and I had tempura and it didn't come with grated daikon, which is traditionally served with tempura in Japan, but they had it available upon request. Bonus!! The tempura wasn't greasy so the oil was fresh and nothing tasted over cooked. The only real negative (but for us, it's a biggie) was they were sweeping and cleaning the restaurant while customers were still eating. In a way that felt like they were in a hurry for us to leave. That's a bit of a double-edged sword I know because you don't want the restaurant dirty and you want to keep the staff busy as things slow down but it didn't feel right for several waiters to be sweeping around us while we were still eating and there's at least 2 hours before the restaurant closed.

They didn't open until 4pm so I was good.  I wondered about the parking since I did not know the area.  There is street parking and some lots that are close, but no parking at the restaurant itself.  We lucked out and got the last spot in a little lot right at the end of Elm street and the restuarant was just a few steps away. Which was great since it was very cold that night.   We arrived around 4:30 so we got to pick our seats.  The staff was great.  We had great service. Very friendly.  My husband's mother was from Somerville so he said he had wanted to try some of the restaurants in the area.  He had also wanted to try the beer from their brewery - Slumbrew.  It was an IPA and he really liked it. I had a glass of Pinot Noir it was also very nice.  We had the PEI mussels for an app with the white wine sauce.  Very good - sweet and delicious. We both wanted seafood.  He ordered the baked scallops - they were very good he had 8-10 and a side of pasta.  I ordered the Pan roasted Sesame Salmon which came with some carmelized onions, mushrooms and red peppers with roasted sweet potatoes. It was all excellent and our waiter was very attentive.  While we were there the restaurant started filling up and our waiter still made sure we were taken care of.  Great food, great service.  The only reason for the 4 stars is the parking.  I am writing this Sunday night so no issues with any of the food.\\nEnjoy!!"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"641 S State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"3","text":"Not a bad location.

But when you're walking down the streets of Little Italy in the North End of Boston and practically every person that walks by you is carrying a Mike's Pastry box wrapped in the black and white colored strings; how can you not be tempted to test out what the \\"Home of the Cannoli\\" brand logo is all about?TIP: Modern Pastry is one side of the street while Mike's Pastry is located a few steps down on the opposite side of the street. So as we approach this place, the line is out the door and past the next storefront. It's actually quite a sight to see at how many people are actually lining up to get into the store to further stand in more lines to try to reach the front counter in order to place their order for their cannoli. Along with their cannoli, Mike's actually does sell other baked goods such as cookies and rolls, as well as gelato. The only thing is that no one even really looks at those except the cannoli which are being ordered by a couple to a couple boxes.The whole process itself took us a good 15 minutes before we walked out with our order of 3 cannoli to do a taste test to compare against the cannoli from Modern Pastry.We ordered:\\n1) Amoretto: filled with an almond (soy milk filtered out taste) filling topped off with almond pieces at the ends - this actually seemed really sweet to me as I continued taking a few more bites. The filling definitely overpowered the taste of the shell and I felt like i was eating a mouth of sweet creamy almonds. \\n2) Hazelnut: filled with hazelnut filling and topped off with hazelnut crumbs at the ends - i would describe this similar to eating a Nutella filled cannoli (nix the chocolate mixed in); however, this was actually my favorite even though I don't normally gravitate towards Nutella or chocolate. The filling was just sweet enough to provide a good flavor to the overall cannoli.\\n3) Oreo: filled with creamy vanilla and bits of chocolate filling (think like cookies and cream ice cream) and topped off with Oreo crumbled bits on the ends - this was actually a pretty good cannoli and each ingredient complimented well with each other. the filling was not too sweet as well which was nice.Texture of the filling in all 3: Definitely a little thicker compared to Modern Pastry's filling in their cannoli's (which is more creamy custardy - flavor kind of reminds me of an Chinese egg tart custard almost).Overall, I do think there is a difference in the way Mike's cannoli's and Modern's cannoli's has in not just the taste, but also in terms of flavor, texture, and shape of the cannoli (Mike's being more of a tube shell and Modern's being more of a trapezoid shaped shell). But you'll only know if you do your own Cannoli Taste Test Challenge!"},{"name":"BrickTop's","address":"3280 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste 100","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We made a reservation for 630 on a saturday thinking there will be a long wait time if we don't.

For a restaurant in the heart of Buckhead and the price of the food, I was expecting better. The food was mediocre at best.  After dinner, my friend got sick while walking out of the restaurant. She went back into the restaurant to throw up several times before she was able to feel well enough to leave. She told the hostess at the front about what happened. She wasn't looking to get a refund or anything, she just wanted to let them know in case other customers might have the same experience. The hostess just told her that food poisoning doesn't happen until 3 hours later. My friend is a nurse. I think she would know if she was having food poisoning or not. They didn't even offer her water or anything to help her feel better. Instead, all 6 of us waited for our friend going in and out of the bathroom to throw up. We were there for at least 30 minutes.

I opted for the Blue Ridge wedge which comes w/ fresh stalks of romaine instead of iceberg which I loved! The flat iron was cooked perfect and very tender and the fries reminded me of poutine since they were covered in the rosemary bordelaise and seasoned just right. This Steak and Frites did not disappoint and hopefully it stays on the menu long enough for me to try again soon. I also tried the new bold bites on the menu and the sweet corn fritters served w/ red chili ranch is a must try for only $4.49.

So we paid the same as if I had added the tofu. Boo.Husband got the Pineapple fried rice extra hot, which was a touch too spicy for him. We are used to \\"spicy\\" not actually being spicy so this was a treat for me. I didn't try his extra spicy because he got egg, so I'm not sure if it would have been too spicy for me. I had ordered spicy and it was perfect. They also had extra extra spicy and thai lao spicy. Yay!My father-in-law ordered the appetizer sampler as his meal to go with ours and it came out as an appetizer. Boo.The next morning I woke up with a not very happy belly. I'm pretty sure it was from dinner because the rest of my meals were from home and usual faire. Could have been the spice? But I eat a lot of spicy food. So perhaps the curry was not actually vegan, who knows. Meh.The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. I probably will not go back. The place was pretty empty at 6pm."},{"name":"Old Santa Fe Mexican Grill","address":"994 Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"So bad in service , no one showed up even after 15 min .

The decor is quite lovely, but the service depends on whom you have as a server. We were regulars (but not any more). We enjoyed the server from Bay Moorings, and also a French server we had one evening. The woman we have endured four times for brunch now has put us off completely. That, and the attitude of the owner/manager... This place offers one kind of bread for all egg dishes, toast, evening meal accompaniment, etc. Sourdough. Two servers have mentioned our concerns (and that of our three friends) to management. We suggested that having some brown bread as a choice is not expensive and would be a vast improvement over the thin, rock-hard toasted sourdough. However, management is not interested. As a result, five of us will no longer be patronizing this restaurant. My husband and I were visiting three times a week. Do the math! I should have offered to bring my own bread and ask them to toast it. Very poor attitude and a lot of shrugging.

Crisp, refreshing, with a kind of citrus depth and richness that paired so well with what came next.Salt and pepper beef ribs. Melt in your mouth meatiness with cilantro, lime, and tiny fried jalapenos gave it heat and a fun summer flavor. The conversation stopped while we dug in. Uni roasted bone marrow.

They serve it with a spicy sauce that has sesame seeds in it, which is pretty tasty.  But if you don't use the sauce, the calamari itself is really bland and sometimes has been rubbery.Something that I've always thought was silly is that you can only get the happy hour prices if you sit in the bar or on the patio.

The actual food was pretty ok- I'm from Colorado and while I'm American born I was raised with many Traditional Chinese Food Recipes and found the Boston Dim Sum lacking in some flavors- The Steamy Pork Buns were almost bland in comparison to others I've tried.The service... Was sub par. It took forever for the actual cart we wanted to get to us. Multiple times we made it a note to tell the servers we'd been waiting on a specific dish to get to our table and still we waited. The push cart ladies didn't seem too happy to be there in the first place let alone appease the customers cravings. I think next time I'm craving Dim Sum I'll try another place in Chinatown before resorting to coming back to China Pearl."},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"for $8.00 lunch buffet on a Saturday , this place rocked.  lots of options, fresh nan and very helpful wait staff.  wonderful lunch."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"yay mama. and yay esp to all those parties of three and up who had to wait for a table. suckas. the husband and i walked right in and grabbed seats at the bar which is called the velvet lounge. it was kinda of edgy victorian with crystal chandeliers and black and white wallpaper. exposed brick walls were covered with mirrors in funky gold frames and there's a huge window at the front that lets in lots of natural light so you don't feel like you're eating in a dark bar.  the husband had the biscuits and gravy--which was pure decadence. biscuits were heavenly--buttery and soft , and the sausage gravy was ridiculous, sooo creamy and rich. his scrambled eggs were a little overcooked, but it kinda didn't matter cause the gravy brought them back to life. \\n \\ni ordered mike's special scramble, which was equally outstanding. my eggs were perfect actually and scrambled with prosciutto ham, provolone, basil, fresh tomato and roasted garlic. i need to make this at home. also my potatoes were roasted perfectly. everything is generous--from the food portions to the big pours of champagne in the mimosas with just a splash of OJ. very nice. the wait staff was cool--you don't get a ton of attention at the bar, but everyone was friendly despite being super busy. there is so much great food in portland so i don't know if we'll go back, but i would def say you gotta here once."},{"name":"Thai Basil","address":"1215 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Thai Basil was my favourite thai restaurant in VancouverIt was authentic, had a great location, and was inexpensiveI was a regular off and on for several yearsHowever, sad to say that the quality has gone downhill..Pad Krapow is hit or miss, must be depending on the chefFish cakes are usually a good bet, but last time they were really greasy, and seemed to have shrunk in sizeOh well, it is what it is..my visits have become less frequent, and now pretty much seldomThai Iced Tea is good, though"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"It's a bit poor for service here lol\\nThe employees seem lazy.

Victor and Rosa have devoted their lives to the people of Somerville and Medford and are the hardest working, friendliest, most appreciative restaurant operators I have ever met.  Their daughter Nancy and her husband Jason now carry on the family tradition combining fresh ideas with the same commitment to exceptional service and memorable italian entrees including eggplant parm, chicken marsala, lasagna, calzones, sicilian pizza, stuffed crust pizza, and so many others.  Communities are defined in large part by certain businesses whose character and passion set them apart from other operations and Victor's has added so much to Somerville's identity while setting the standard for italian food.  Keep it up guys."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I agree with what a lot of people say: The food is decent at best, but the view is TERRIFIC. Actually, I just like the general atmosphere of the place. It's like casual upscale, if that makes any sense. The location is pretty nice, and the views really are that nice. If you can get there in time for the sunset, then it's pretty cool. In fact a lot of people, especially those who've been drinking, will applaud at the sunset, which is amusing. The food I didn't think was really *that* bad. Apparently it used to be a lot worse years ago, but then they switched the cooks and when I was there last I didn't have any real complaints. It is a little overpriced for the quality of what you're getting, but it ain't horrible. I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was like their most expensive thing only because I don't go there often at all. It was like 25 bucks and it had some steak, shrimp, fish and shrimp; I thought it was decent enough.I haven't been here in like a year and a half, but last I went they were doing a ton of construction, like expanding the restaurant (which already sits like 1,000 people altogether or something ridiculous), putting in parking garages and adding in this art gallery or something. I'm sure they're done with most of it, and someone who knows can elaborate on that, but I believe they're trying to make it into this big artsy area where people can sell their artwork or something. In short, the food is decent and kind of expensive, but it is a great place to have drinks with friends, enjoy the view and chill. If only they really would just improve the food, then this would be a truly excellent place."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went again after some time away, and had the half sandwich, pho lunch combo.

Beatles cover on Fridays, rocks on Saturdays, Latin on Sundays. Great for kids too, especially on Friday nights when the music is more family-oriented. I love seeing my 4-yr old son dancing with the little kids to Beatles music.Here are the major cons:\\n- Food is not worth the cost\\n- Too crowded, especially on the weekend\\n- Parking is almost impossibleThe Oasis is 5 min from my house and I used to go there every weekend. I tried almost everything on the menu to justify having dinner there but have long given up. I cannot find anything that's worth having there for the cost. So we ended up eating dinner somewhere else and going there for drinks only (which are pretty decent).However, ever since they turned the whole Oasis area into a mini shopping mall, parking (which was pretty bad before) has become impossible. They built a 4-floor garage which still barely holds the popular traffic there. The last couple of times we tried to go to the Oasis on a weekend, we could not find parking anywhere so we ended up going somewhere else. I am sad. I wish I can go back there more often 'cuz it's still one of my favorite hang out spots.

Unfortunately, there was sour cream on my migas even though I'd asked for without. The waitress was very sweet and apologetic...and had a new one (sans sour cream) in front of me within minutes. The migas were so delish that I ate every last bite.  My colleague also cleaned her plate of eggs and sausage. My biscuits and gravy colleague wasn't able to put much of a dent in her meal.

When our server finally came over to our table (never filled water, or asked if we would like more drinks) and I questioned the delay, his response was \\"well at least the food is good\\". WRONG, there are many restaurants in Atlanta with great food and great service. I realize Ray's has been here for a long time but competition is stiff with all the new Chefs opening restaurants in this market.

I don't believe there are any other vegan Thai restaurants in town (at least that I'm aware of) and I'm especially positive that there are none where the food is cooked and served almost entirely by African Americans who know their stuff when it comes to Thai food. We ordered a wide assortment of dishes and everything hit the spot. My favorites included the appetizer assortment (the spring rolls and corn fritters were scrumptious) and the larb chicken salad, which came on a bed of arugula (not very Thai, but worked perfectly). The Pad Thai was fine, not particularly memorable, but the vegan shrimp it came with, were better than those served in most vegetarian Chinese restaurants. This place serves schnazzy Thai food, as opposed to authentic, no greasy noodles or exceptionally spicy anything here. However, I can't avoid mentioning that the seating in this tiny space is mostly uncomfortable. I don't see how people seated in the arty communal table in the middle can even fit a plate and drink in the tiny space afforded them. As for the six or so mini wooden booths, they are comfortable for only one person, crowded for two and nearly impossible for three or more. The restaurant is limited in what they can do with this space, but it would be worthwhile to entirely transform the seating, so that at least a few groups of four people can sit comfortably without plates falling on the floor. As it is now, I wouldn't go to this restaurant with a party of four.

Might as well get a dozen because it gets exponentially more worth it the more you get. Plus, theres 6 flavors so then you can get two of each to try them all. Since these donuts are small, they're crispy on the outside and more oily than usual. The cinnamon sugar is just like a churro, just more fluffy. Honey, Nutella, and bacon are on the savory side because they're all fairly salty. I prefer sweet donuts, but these are still worth a try. The dirty wu was a mix of all their sweet toppings so it was perfect for me. The seasonal flavor was lavender which came out as a jam in the center of the donut. Again great sizing because every bite you get some donut and filling whereas with regular donuts some bites are just donut and some have too much filling. Also got a large hot chocolate since I'm not a fan of chai. Super rich and had one of those cool Latte designs on top.

Pretty damn ridiculous and the guy was a complete dick about it, but every time I've been back I haven't seen him so maybe he got fired.This story aside, this is one of my go to bars on the close in east side. The music is always great, the decor is divey which is my prefered decor, and the food is passable. The beer selection is always good, they have a good happy hour as well with cheap beers and the food which is not bad not great though. There are several seating options outside which are usually taken, but the inside is where you want to be anyway.Gotta mention the velvet painting on the wall, many of which I have dreamt of stealing including the few creepy clown pictures on the wall towards the bathroom.

As for the chicken bulgogi, it was good as well, nothing too earth shattering though. But still overall I would say the food here is above average and great. They have such a big and extensive menu that I would definitely come back to try something different. Who doesn't love having a wide range of choices to choose from?Our waiter was nice too and made sure to get our orders in before happy hour ended. We came in during a time when they weren't too busy, so our food came out pretty quickly as well.

Downstairs is the Chinese food and hibatchi (which was not staffed when I went) and upstairs they had the sushi part of the restaurant which I did not go to. Ambiance-wise, it was clean and inviting except for the huge dining table that they decided the wait staff should be eating and cleaning vegetables at -- which I don't really mind and even expect for a tiny Asian restaurant in the middle of nowhere. I ordered the crispy duck and sauteed bok choy with rice. The portions were large but the prices were a little bit on the pricey-side, which I guess is reflecting the place's remoteness. You only ever get the combination of cheap and good food in areas of large ethnic communities, so the price made sense to me. While food and price-wise I was satisfied with, it just left me to mentally deal with the strange edifice that was this Chinese/Japanese restaurant. They must feel as self-conflicted as all the Korean sushi places in America that force themselves to greet their customers with an \\"irrashai\\" yet sneak kimchi into their appetizers. Back at Asian Gourmet, it all kinda made sense with the smooth jazz, just barely audible ranchero music emanating from the kitchen, and soft mandarin chatter mixing together. At least they're open late."},{"name":"El Brasero Mexican Cart","address":"12TH Ave Se Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"So it was a weird day yesterday all the way around... but this, this is unbelievable, even for Portland. \\nI was running late and skipped breakfast, a big no no. So I decided to get a burrito at the food carts on 11th & Hawthorne. They are generally ok, nothing to write home about, but ya know, a burrito would certainly keep me full through the entire day. \\nSo, I go up to the little window and I order a Classic Vegetarian from a guy on a phone. Since it has no guacamole or anything, I ask for fresh avocado. He says $8... um, oookkkaaayyy, that is a bit much for a food cart vege burrito, but hey, maybe it's awesome. I'm alright with that. This is almost twice as much as it was a year ago mind you it's only a vege after all, ya know with like 75 cents of actual cost. He takes my money, hands me $2, and before I could even tell him how I wanted it he turns around and starts doing stuff... I am trying to get his attention.. \\"excuse me\\", \\"pardon me sir\\" and the like. I am completely ignored. I also have a stamp card for this cart and I have it on the counter and I want him to stamp it so I can put it away and put my gloves back on - it's freezing outside. I continue to be ignored while he has a very loud conversation, in Spanish, on the phone. I finally say, \\"maybe if you weren't on the phone you could do your job a little better?\\" Again, he does not hear me (I do know he didn't hear me) and I refuse to scream in to a cart. After what seemed like forever he turns around hand hands me a burrito. It is very very light for an $8 burrito, very. I have to practically jump up and down to get his attention again and ask him to stamp my card, I even say please as I am over the previous shit - I have my food, I just want to go. He looks at me and just says \\"NO\\", very rude and loud. Nothing else. I say, but it is for this cart, I have previous stamps from here. He again says \\"NO\\". Um, huh? I say \\"excuse me?\\" He says something like \\"we don't have those\\" I say \\"but you do and here it is\\", I turn the card so he can clearly see the logo. If they in fact discontinued the stamp cards, that would be one thing and he could easily have said so. I finally can't take any more - this has been one the absolute rudest experiences I have had in as long as I can remember. I say to him, \\"sir, you have been very rude to me\\" (when I get mad I get very polite)... before I can say anything else, and while he is still on the damned phone mind you, he turns the radio up full blast in my face. Um, really? So I walk away. As I am walking through the lot I say to the guy that had greeted me upon entry at another cart, what a rude experience that was. Then I decide I do not even want his burrito. I can't take it any more and I turn around and throw the burrito at the cart. I was intending to get it into the window, but a pitcher I am not. It hits the cart and explodes all over the little stairs. AHHHHHHH, much better. Normally throwing a burrito that cost $8 would never be an option for me, I am usually a bit better behaved. However, in this case I feel like I was not only in the right, I almost had a duty for myself and anyone else that has endured such horrible service. And it turns out, the burrito was almost all rice. make that 35 cents worth of ingredients. The name of the place is El Brasero and I intend to Yelp and Google Review this story and I hope if he is not the owner, that it reaches them. Especially considering I was the only customer at that cart (hmm, wonder why) and it was lunch time. I went and got a bowl of Pho (at Pho Gia, which is awesome) and felt much better, even with the horrible Christmas music."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Enjoyed the oasis at lunch Monday.

The atmosphere is upscale, modern and beautiful. While it definitely is the kind of place for a special event kind of meal, you don't have to be dressed up to go there. In other words, it's great food and great atmosphere, without a snobby attitude.My favorite roll, hands-down, is the Torchimaki. It's a roll that includes crawfish, asparagus, whitefish and spicy mayo, but what makes it different is that the top of the roll is torched so it has a grilled flavor. Hard to describe, but incredibly delicious. A server recommended it, and I will be forever grateful to her. I would also recommend the kobe beef and tuna carpaccio appetizers. The kobe isn't always on the menu, but they've always had it when we requested it.Cocktails aren't cheap but they're strong. The service is mostly good, and like another Yelper pointed out, it seems like the busier it is, the better the service. I've also eaten at the Winter Park Village location, and while the food was good, the atmosphere there isn't nearly as nice as Baldwin Park. My other complaint about that location is that they have been known to clean while there are diners present, and nobody wants to smell ammonia and cleaning products while eating.Baldwin Park Seito Sushi is some of the best sushi in Orlando, and definitely one with a great atmosphere."},{"name":"Bento Hut","address":"349 Decatur St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I tried this restaurant with the family and this place and food is amazing.

A nondescript Peruvian hole in the wall nestled tight, almost hidden,  inside of a strip mall.  Their claim to fame is roasted chicken but they should stop waving their chicken flag and replace it with a ceviche one immediately! Big juicy shrimp cured with lime, celery,  red onion and a perfect amount of salty tang on a soft yam patty.  Not fishy, not too jam packed with veggies, just a ton of mouth puckering WIN.  I was not a fan of the roasted corn on the side. Nor of our waiter who was a Peruvian version of Napoleon Dynamite.  He was so earnest,  but just all nervous and unsure. I considered faking like I was choking at one point,  just to get him to pay attention to me. The restaurant is tiny, paper menus,  with a ton of interesting options.

Visiting PDX for a few days and went here for NYE/birthday dinner. The menu is a nice range of homey food with upscale quality with more esoteric additions by the Mother of the month. For instance, this month was lamb curry and a vegetarian thali platter. My St Germain and sparkling wine cocktail was very nice. Grilled portobello mushroom appetizer was well charred and nicely chewy and nice flavor. My husband had fried ravioli that were good, though not stellar. My son had the special Mac and cheese, which was a fresh egg fettuccine with a cream/reggiano sauce. Yummy! I had a split entre√© (such a great option!): chicken and dumplings + meat loaf. Both were full of flavor and sides spot on as well. The meatloaf is made with high-quality Angus beef and a rich, flavorful gravy. Portions are full size and you will not go hungry. Given the holiday, we decided on a trio of desserts: pear & blackberry sorbets; creme br√ªl√©e; and devil's food cake. Again, full size portions. The waiter understood without being told that were splitting/sharing and brought us a good-sized knife to cut the cake with. Good thing as the slice was about ten feet high and super-deliciously dense--a stand-out dessert. All the staff were very friendly and helpful (this is Portland after all). The only nit-pick is that our waiter only addressed the list of specials to the two adults at the table, skipping right past our 11-yr-old son between us. Since our son had already declined the kid's menu (he has a pretty sophisticated palate I'm proud to say), so he was also interested in hearing the specials and should have been included.

The menu offered a very good selection of apps, sandwiches, entrees, and specials. There was a modest wine list but a huge choice of micro-brews. Many items on the menu are quite reasonable - for example burgers are only $6-9. For us the service was highly efficient- just short of feeling rushed before taking our order but the ongoing follow-up and checking-in continued after the meal was delivered- so A+ for that. On a Friday night the place was hopping- busy and loud which was fun.Here's the rest- Maybe just a coincidence but our table (to the left side of the bar as you enter) was seemingly on the kids side- almost every table had young children- many of them running around. It's very kid-friendly if you have young children. For others looking for a bit more of an adult dining experience- it wasn't to be. When I went to the rest room, I noticed the seating on the other side of the bar had no children. A coincidence? Maybe. But IF you have a seating plan for a kids side and non-kids side let us know in case we have a preference. Given the chaos of the place- the kids didn't really make any difference. \\nFood- Average and uninspiring. My steak tips (at the top of the pricing on the menu) were tough without much flavor. I like chewy tips. These were tough. They came with green beans (an offered swap for broccoli) and fries. I didn't care for the presentation. The green beans were on the plate which was piled very high with fries and the tips were on top of the fries. This made getting to the green beans a chore. The grilled meatloaf was a bit dry and the huge over-sized onion rings (almost the size of a doughnut)- while impressive to look at weren't to my liking.

I live in the Lake Travis area, and I have a similar view to The Oasis every evening, so I'm not impressed by it.  That said, it is a pleasant enough looking place, somewhat of a monstrous building perched atop a west-facing hill.  It tends to be noisy and touristy-crowded on the weekends.I visited with a couple of friends and shared out orders of Chipotle Baby Back Ribs, the 'Big Ol' Burger', and the 'Texas Red Fish'. The Baby Backs were so-so; I could get similar flavors from warming up a slab of pre-cooked ribs from H-E-B. The burger was 'meh' and certainly no bargain compared to Whataburger. The fish was the real kicker. 'Redfish' implies that you're getting some variant of Red Snapper, or Red Drum.  However, a careful read of the menu shows that it's Texas 'Red' Fish.When I asked about this, I was informed that this referred to the recipe, which made the whitefish used 'reddish'. After tasting the result, I'm thinking that one of the two restaurant-trade staples of cheap basa or tilapia were used.  I could live with that.  But the flavor...yeah, something was definitely 'off'.  No one got sick, but the consensus was that this was a fillet that had been stuck at the back of the freezer, got freezer-burned, and was brought out at the last minute.  Truly awful.If you must come, come for the view and after-dinner drinks.This place gets only 1 star on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good.

Not a big deal, but the table we wanted didn't get filled for another 15-20 minutes. 2) from my seat I could see where the staff smoke. Specifically, I witnessed the male cook (with the accent) smoke and immediately return to the kitchen. There is no way he could have washed his hands in that amount of time. As a Registered Nurse, I know how important hand hygiene is. 3) we were waiting for quite a long time for our food. We started to see tables, who ordered after us, get served breakfast. We questioned the waitress, who apologized who forgetting to enter our order. 4) the side of pancakes that came with one of our meals looked great. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy them. A fly had landed on them and was walking around. There were many flies in the restaurant. We told our waitress about the issue, she apologized and took the plate away. She did not offer to replace or refund the food. 5) I visited the restroom in the restaurant. They are in the kitchen. I'm not sure how sanitary that situation is. What's more disturbing is that not one person handling food was wearing gloves. A gentleman was chopping raw food right next to the bathroom and the cook was at the grill. Personally, I prefer restaurant cooks to wear gloves. Especially if they're not washing their hands after cigarette breaks. 6) the food was mediocre, at best. I had the western omelette. It was runny in the center and the potatoes were tasteless. The food quality and staff service down the street at Jimmy's is far superior.

I am always excited to try new sushi places on the outskirts of Columbus as I am constantly looking for hidden gems to frequent. Though Moshi is good, it was not worth the extra drive to Bexley for what it was. I would have given them another star as I did enjoy their drink menu, but was simply disappointed at the lack of diversity in some of their rolls. If I lived down the street I am certain I would probably return every couple months out of convenience alone. I do give them credit for knowing their audience as the menu certainly would suit the general customers of the area, but true sushi connoisseurs would ask for more.

Chocolate, and lots of it, seemed like a great idea. The exterior of the restaurant definitely had a Willy Wonka/Steampunk vibe. Inside was cool too, but not quite as out there as the exterior. I did love the continuously running video walls showing a whimsical CG chocolate factory, complete with flying robots.But we were really there for the food, and weren't disappointed. Lots of chocolate on the menu, of course, including an app of Warm Chocolate Almond Bread. To stay in spirit, I ordered a bottle of Young's Double Chocolate Stout. I loved it! My wife had the Forest Mushroom flatbread (mushrooms, goat cheese, caramelized onions, arugula, white truffle oil) and the Super Foods salad (spinach, arugula, avocado, quinoa, asparagus, sundried roasted tomatoes, red onion, pine nuts, feta cheese, citrus vinaigrette). Both were excellent.I had some of the salad, and the Brisket and Wild Mushroom Meatloaf (roasted corn, crispy fried onions, Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, bordelaise sauce). It was exactly what I was craving, between the richly flavored sauce and mashed potatoes, and the added crunch from the fried onions.We didn't finish all our food to save room for one of the many chocolate desserts. I gotta tell you, it was overwhelming (in a good way). Lots of crazy great milkshakes, and more normal desserts. We chose the Brookies, Cookies, and Cream Sundae (brookie -- a crunchy brownie?, chocolate chip cookie, oreo cookies and cream ice cream, fresh whipped cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate shavings).We couldn't finish our meal, so we took some of it to go, to enjoy the next day.Service was adequate, though our waiter seemed to be a bit distracted. He'd go off for a while to bring us something, and wouldn't show up for 10 minutes.

So we each picked the chocolate mousse cake. The fruit tart was HEAVENLY. I'm pretty picky about my crust...it was the right amount of soft flakiness (if that's even a word) without falling apart before you can eat it, or too hard that you have to cut it with chainsaw.  The fruit was super fresh and the custard wasn't too sweet. Maybe it was the fact that we were both about to burst or that we were so satisfied with our tarts that nothing could compare after, but the chocolate mousse was only Ok.

Our takeout from Mandarin Cove tasted as though it was pre-cooked, and had been sitting around for awhile, before it was ladled out into our takeout containers. The dry sauteed string beans is one of my favorite Chinese food veggie side dishes, but Mandarin Cove's version was just icky...soggy beans and of course...super greasy.For the horrible quality of the food, I thought the prices were a little high.

This might be the best restaurant I've been to since I moved here. (Arizona's in Stone Mountain gives it a run for its money though; that's the only reason I say \\"might be.\\")  Had no idea that it had such ambiance (white table cloths, water features, valet, etc.)  For some reason, I thought this was a family-style place -- not!!!  Went in during the day so I was cool but think I would have felt a little under-dressed in flats and summer casual at night.  Okay, now for the important stuff -- the food.  Some of the best I've ever had anywhere (NY, LA, etc.)  -- I mean, audible \\"oohs and ahhs\\" to the point where it was getting embarrassing. Barbecue shrimp appetizer is so much better than it sounds and reads on the menu (not sweet and gooey at all) -- can't even describe this New Orleans style sauce they use and won't begin to try to figure out ingredients. (I should add that it is almost impossible to stump me.)  The shrimp was served on a  perfectly prepared polenta cake  (but better than usual polenta you get every where which can be dry and boring -- this was more like real down home grits and  subtly aged cheese.)  Crabcake was fresh and prepared in a manner that I can only describe as \\"clean\\" not floury. Tossed green salad was perfectly dressed.  Glass of something white (can't remember) from Monterrey just put me over the top.  Only went in there to postpone getting on 285 during rush hour and wanted a break from the usually Whole Foods salad.  I can't wait to go back and have more.   Wait staff was impeccable -- knowledgeable and attentive but not obnoxious (know what I mean?) -- just relaxed and friendly while providing white glove service. Only room for improvement?  The hostess/reception person seemed a little less than thrilled to be there and/or seat us (maybe both)  -- definitely didn't fit in with 5-star treatment from valet and wait staff, but hey, on another day, maybe they have other greeters.Oh yeah the view -- soothing to look at the Chattahoochee and they have a place outside to eat -- that was actually the main reason that I wanted to go there in the first place.  I'm telling you, the food is so good, after 5 mins., I didn't even notice the view. Great for dates, business lunches/dinners, adult family outings (it's too nice for kids -- sorry, that's just telling like it is).Pricey? Eh -- not cheap by any means but not ridiculous either and worth every penny in my book. You'd pay the same at a lesser restaurant in the area unless you're talking about a big chain."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Authentic and overall scrumptious cannoli.

It allows the servers to abuse the system by receiving tips despite extremely poor service. We were a party of 5 at ginza on sat night. Contrary to what you may think, it was a rather slow that night. There was more than adequate  waitresses for the 6 tables that were there. We ordered some apps, entrees and rolls. The entrees came out 25 mins before the 4 rolls, which itself took an hour to come out. Furthermore, we repeatedly had to request additional tea from the waitresses. The food itself was decent but we felt the service was horrible. Then we get our check and to our surprise, 18% tip was surcharged onto the bill. There was no stipulation on the menu nor relayed to us prior to ordering that a tip would be added. I consider myself an average tipper and generally remain in the 15-20% rate, dependent on service as I believe tips should be conmensurate with service. To this point, I asked the manager what they did to warrant such a tip and his response was that it is policy to surcharge the tip for parties of 5 or more. I then ask where on the menu or anywhere is this policy stated and he was not able to answer me. Granted he did adjust my bill because I complained but honestly, this auto gratuity is becoming ridiculous. It shouldn't allow the service to seemingly be non existent because a tip is guaranteed.

I like how they have the one table attached, pretty neat for a truck, but I've only eaten my food on the street.So far I've tried the fish schwarma and the seafood poutine. The schwarma was a nice pita pocket that figuratively exploded in my hands it was packed with so much fish. Very tasty. The poutine was also very good, I never thought I would enjoy a seafood poutine but their version of the cheese fries and gravy are very well done.Next time I'll have to give the straight up fish and chips a go."},{"name":"De Dutch","address":"7310 120th St, Ste 110","city":"Surrey","stars":"3.5","text":"We always come here and it's always an amazing experience.

I was really excited to try this raved about restaurant, but I don't think it lived up to the hype.I paid $170 total for my meal, which included the Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup, the Porterhouse Steak for Two, and a 20%+ tip for awesome service. The food was overpriced for what it was, but it is Disney so dining at a \\"classier\\" place there I suppose it's to be expected. Our waiter was awesome and gave recommendations for food and also what else to see for the parks we were going to over the next few days.The soup was good, but I actually prefer Panera's Broccoli Cheddar Soup to what we had. The soup had a weird texture to me and wasn't smooth... almost pasty?The steak was also good, but my boyfriend says I make better steak when we buy it from Wegman's and cook at home. Whether true or he was just trying to sweet talk, the steak definitely wasn't worth $119. It comes out sliced already, which seems great, but it was cold when it got to our table. We asked them to warm it up again which they did, and it tasted okay, but again not worth $119. You could probably go to a local chain steakhouse and get the same quality.The crispy onions on top of the steak were really good though. The other sides (mashed potatoes and lobster foyot) were nothing worth writing home about.Overall kind of disappointed with this place considering how well-reviewed and pricey is, but the service was beyond what I expected."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I took my friend here for the first time today and it didn't let us down.

Mike's has cannolis with different fillings and different shells which makes it hard to choose just one.  The tiramisu is heavenly sinful.  I've never tasted tiramisu that was so smooth and so rich in flavor.  Like the cannolis, Mike's tiramisu is the best I've had so far in my life.  Forget about paying $5 for a small mediocre piece of Tiramisu at Finale's.  Go to Mike's for the real deal...and only pay $3 \\n \\nService(7/10)=Service is good for the most part.  Can't ask for too much considering it's a bakery that is constantly packed with customers.\\n \\nAmbiance(7/10)=Not much to look at here either.  There's a couple of tables set up at the front of the store.  Considering how crowded it is, you won't be able to see ALL the pastries Mike's has to offer until you are right at the front and placing your order.  That said, unless it's your first time at Mike's Pastry, you pretty much have to know what you want going there because you will be rushed.\\n \\nOverall Opinion=BEWARE! Like other Yelpers have said, this place is a TOURIST TRAP.  The line is always long, and it gets fairly chaotic once you get inside.  Supposedly there are two lines, one for the baked goods, and one for the gelato/coffee. However, this distinction may not be clear just because of how PACKED it is inside.  If you are planning to go to Mike's for the first time, make sure you bring some cash since this place doesn't take credit cards.  I'm giving this place four Yelp stars and not five because I've only been here twice, and have only tried the cannolis and tiramisu.  If I try the other pastries in the future and they are also heavenly sinful, then I'll upgrade this place to five Yelp stars."},{"name":"Crush","address":"1400 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"After a late night happy hour meal, my buddies and I were still \\"thirsty\\" and so we headed to the closest bar.

It was quite a challenge for us to consume our martinis, so we ended up only finishing about half the glass. But the food was great! Good-looking and memorable dishes. I had the Salmon Rockefeller with Chef's potatoes - delish! My cousin had the Chicken Dixie which was very good as well. I also tried some dirty rice and that was outstanding! I definitely will get that next time I return. The ambiance is dark and romantic, but doesn't necessarily have to be for dates only, as they do have large tables to accommodate for families or a large group.

I loved it so much that before I left I knew I had to get my hands on another one. I was so ecstatic that there was a location at the airport. From terminal T, I took the airtrain to terminal B just to look for this place. And there it was in all its glory beaming at me. It was a dual establishment- bookstore/cafe. I loved everything about it appearance wise. It was just as classy and handsome. We were seated by the host and of course I put in my order for the cheesecake. Our server came back and advised that they ran out. I was absolutely disappointed. He then advised for me to go to the front to check out what they had because they were out of a lot of cheesecakes. Of course, they were out of my second selection as well. Our server advised me once more that they were out of quite a few cheesecakes. I mean allegedly, this is one of the busiest airports in the US and you're running out of cheesecakes like that. Wouldn't you think to keep them stock since they're known for their coffees and desserts?! My brother ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. It was delicious but came with 4 thin toast. He requested for some more toast but there was an additional charged for 4 more thin pieces. So if we didn't order more toast, what did they expect us to finish the dip with our fingers?! So you purposely don't give us enough toasts, so that we can order more, to up charge us without even telling us?!? That's just absurd to me and a poor reflection of the brand.

Voda used to offer coffee from inside their shop, but then expanded their coffee business to include light pastries and sandwiches.This itty bitty coffee shop has some serious potential. The front window and tables (you could sit about 6 people in the shop comfortably) are just about pinch-your-cheek adorable. And the lady behind the counter deserves 5 stars on customer service. She asked if I was from the neighborhood (I'm not) and noted that she hadn't seen my face before. We chatted briefly about Olde Towne East as she served me coffee.Here's where I give my two cents on Portico's room for improvement. As it stands right now, they only serve drip coffee (and perhaps tea). I had my choice between a dark roast and a medium roast - both of which were explained to me. The medium roast comes from women roasters and helps out women who are victims of violence. Yay for helpful coffee! It's my assumption that the selection of coffee will rotate out to make room for different roasts. The coffee was good, you can tell they  keep up on their brew times (coffee shop nerd speaking) - it didn't have that \\"I've been sitting here for 5 hours\\" taste.Portico has a small selection of sandwiches that they make in store. To be honest, I wasn't interested in trying any because of the presentation. They sat inside of a drink cooler wrapped tightly in plastic. How you display your edibles goes a long way! Also available for consumption is a small sampling of baked goods, wrapped in the same manner as the sandwiches. Some were baked in-store while others came from other vendors. It would be nice to see some local bakeries or sweets displayed - since Voda carries such an emphasis on local goods.3 stars for now. With some rearranging of the space at the counter, some work on presentation and selection of the edibles, I could see Portico rising to 4 stars. Add some other coffee selections and 5 stars isn't out of reach!"},{"name":"Sushi Garden","address":"4269 Lougheed Highway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Pretty standard sushi.

I hate to admit my experience at the Easton Northstar left me disappointed and huffy. The service was abysmal.

I don't understand Northstar's excuse.First of all, my friends and I sat at a dirty table for at least seven minutes, and not one runner/server bothered to pick up the trash. We eventually moved it to another table. My buddha bowl came out with chicken instead of tofu, so I sent that back. Then, we had to ask twice for the beer we ordered, and twice for salt. C'mon, Northstar, you're better than this!But there is a reason for giving this location three stars instead of two, and that is, of course, because of the food. Simply put, divine. Concocted by the hands of angels from local food of the earth. Northstar is home of all culinary masterpieces.  I swear by the Buddha Bowl, a perfectly balanced combination of brown rice, vegetables, and tofu in a peanut butter based sauce (I have yet to discover how to recreate the Northstar tofu). Skip the organic cane sugar diet coke, it's just not worth it.

I am a huge cannoli and eclair fan, and everywhere else that I've traveled, I will always try their versions...but NOTHING ever compares.A few weeks ago, fellow Yelper Billy P was headed to Boston, and asked for suggestions on Boston eats. I mentioned this joint. Little did I know that he would come back to Houston with a box of half a dozen chocolate eclairs, hand-carried, just for little old me!!!I swear to God, a tear almost fell when I realized I was about to taste those tasty treats again!!! And when I first took a bite of that succulent outer crust with the cream filling, I just about fainted. I felt like my life flashed before my eyes! I shared the treats with my family, who were also very impressed at the flavor.

I lived out in San Francisco and The Golden Flower was a regular stop, but I think Lees broth just topped it. The calamari and shrimp were cooked perfectly. Usually they are over cooked and tough. These were fresh and the calamari was soft with that nice crunch when you bite into it. The fish cake was by far the best I've ever tried. It was salted beautifully. My pork sandwich was on Lees fresh bread and the meat was so tasty. This place is a must for great food and really inexpensive prices.

Because the ricotta filling is not too sweet and still resembles the ricotta that is needed to make it (a little grainy and on the lighter side, not super smooth and not dense).  The cannolis are giant and come in a variety of flavors - my favorites being the amaretto, ricotta (plain), and chocolate chip.  Even though the line runs down the street it goes pretty fast.  I wish I could buy one of everything in that pastry shop.  I have yet to try their other desserts.  Cash only and know what you want before you get to the counter!  The staff at the counter are very nice.  The last time I went I only ordered 3 items and slowly uttered \\"that's it\\" as my eyes wandered to all the other sweets...and the guy behind the counter could probably sense my hesitation and asked \\"are you sure?\\"  I will be back!"},{"name":"Antonis Restaurant Diner","address":"10765 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"The taste of food and portion size are good, but the menu needs to have more options.

The sushi is on par with your grocery store sushi. (Translate: Skip!) Desserts tend to be hit or miss. I've usually made a beeline for the pineapple stuffed lychees over at the fruit bar.The restaurant interior design and decor are quite impressive; the lighting certainly adds an aesthetic component.

Black pepper popover: this was delicious. Comes with 3 popovers that you spread Wagyu tartar on. Good flavor and decent size.Halibut biryani: this was okay. Not my favorite. The flavors were really strong and the halibut tasted dry.Morel mushroom: another highlight dish. It is a nocchi dish with mushrooms. Great flavor although the nocchi were very mushy. Not my type of pasta. A bit expensive for such a small portion.Matzo ball ramen: love ramen but hate matzo balls.

So, don't go when you're watching your hips.  Third, be patient. There is always a wait. Always.  The bar is first come first serve and my husband and I sit there to avoid the wait and the crowd.

The standard rooms are ok, but they didn't look as good as the upgraded ones (particularly the bathroom) I loved my wedding (wedding was at a different venue) and thought the hotel was totally fine. The room on the wedding night was decent. We didn't mind because we are saving our super extravagant hotels for the honeymoon. The staff was very sweet. I just wished it had been a better deal.

We were seated in the sun, but that's ok, at that time of day, the sun shifts quickly, so I knew we would be in the shadows soon.We were in the shadows by the time the server bothered to come see us. I believe her name was Kenyanna? Anyway, we had enough time to choose our drinks and entrees before she even came by to say she would \\"be right back.\\" Well thank God that she was kind enough to come back 5 minutes after that with some water. Then she promptly took our drink orders and left, we had to stop her to order an appetizer (you have got to be kidding me) ... Anyway, the appetizer came soon enough, but she let us all go dry in our drinks and our waters. Way to go, I have a 2 year old, and its SO easy to deal with a thirsty two year old. Our appetizer was gone before she bothered to take our entree order. The food came, and since this is the Oasis, and they don't have to focus on food quality or service for customers, it tasted mediocre at best. The chicken enchiladas are tasteless, and the beef fajitas probably barely get any attention.Anyway we didn't see her again until she delivered the check. We had to stop other people to get water refills (no way we were going to run up the tab on drinks like we planned to at this point). Wouldn't you know it, at group of 7 is big enough for auto-gratuity. Lovely, now when I was a server, when we had a table that was large enough for automatic gratuity, we made DAMN SURE we took care of them. What can you do with piss poor service when your tip is non negotiable. We were there from 5pm-7:10pm.

When we arrived, around 11am (I heard Dim Sum is only served till 3pm, so check with them if you're going after the noon rush), the restaurant was already pretty crowded, but we were seated promptly. \\nWe were given hot jasmine tea right away, as well as a small dish with hot dipping sauce for our food. Decor is nice- Chinese decoration, with red lanterns and string lights.All the ladies bringing their food carts around were friendly. The food was delicious and very filling: we ordered various things (not sure of all the names)- BBQ pork buns, custard buns, sticky rice that was blended with veggies and meat and topped with cilantro and french friend onions, crispy rolls filled with shrimp and celery, sesame balls with sweet red bean filling, Shrimp and cilantro filled dumplings (similar to Ha Gao, but topped with a pea). Everything was very tasty! We had to ask for soy sauce but received it promptly. We also asked for ice water- it took a few minutes, but we also received that and a server came over to refill our glasses a little later. It's always such a cool experience there (as if you are in another country!), and our bill was also reasonable ($60 with tip for 3 very, very full people).

The avocado puree was tasty though. For dessert, we split a chocolate souffl√©, which was more like a lava cake than a souffl√©, but it was delicious anyway.

Sometimes it's tempting to just cross the street to any of the other pastry places with smaller lines. \\nI've actually done that in the past, and discovered Modern Pastry which has just as many options and wonderful goodness in pastries and desserts.Back to Mike's though- I've tried the pistachio, plain, and chocolate chip cannolis, all of which were packed with ricotta cheese, encased in a crunchy dough shell. I usually order a handful to bring back, because it was quite a trek from Chestnut Hill. Plus they're great for sharing with friends! Mike's is often listed as a \\"must\\" when visiting/living in Boston. I've only been a couple times, and I'm not particularly dying to go back.

Panic ensued as I didn't have the address of the Crawfish Shack. So with a almost dead battery on the phone, we quickly activated the GPS to find it. It wasn't too far away but would the battery last until we found it. Found it just as the battery died.It's tucked away in a little strip mall. Typically seafood inexpensive d√©cor, but I did enjoy the hanging big Lobster.  The only alcohol they serve is beer. After ordering our beers, the waitress told us they re a dollar off for happy hour. It's definitely a neighbor favorite, with lots of locals coming in and being greeted as family. Most were partaking in the Hot Pots, which is on our list to try next time. My yearning was for a PoBoy with shrimp. BF ordered the Crawfish Etouffe and a side of Hush puppies.The service was fast until the locals started to fill the place. Hush Puppies was crispy and hot even BF was enjoying them. Before we knew it the entrees arrived. With one look at the size of the Poboy, my BF told the waitress, you better bring a to-go box.  It was 10 inches long, and you know how women like 10 inchers.There were a dozen coated shrimp inside, with lots of lettuce and tomatoes. It was well worth the price. I have to admit I like my BF Etouffe better. It was a big bowl with lots of crawfish and a kick. My usual one taste turned into 6 spoonfuls before I could stop.  So I did get a To-Go box for a third of my Poboy and 2 Hush puppies. Just as good the next day!We will definitely be coming back for more.

The cream puffs are pastey.  If I had to get one other thing that I had eaten before, it would have to be the gelatto.  My latest attempt to like something else at Mike's was a piece of Turtle Cheesecake.  Meh.  It was shared between myself and another person and we did not even finish it when we were excited to eat it to begin with.  First of off, there is a thick layer of whipped cream on top that taste like opening your mouth while riding a mo-ped. All air.  Then, the  filling is about 4 inches thick with a 1/16 inch piece of crust.  There is no way to get a tasty bite of crust in each fork full.  I can make better at home as the cheesecake tasted like nothing.  Not worth the calories was the comment from the person I was sharing with.If you are in the North End and want a cannoli everyone and their brother makes and sells them and the places with short lines make them just as good as Mikes.It is hard to argue with the success of Mikes and I certainly respect the hard work that goes into their business.

My most recent visit (10/17) would rate this place a 3 over my 5 star experiences I used to have. When I used to frequent the place, I would always order the Israeli cous cous salad. I remember it being so good but for some reason the dressing was ALWAYS oily, like they just couldn't get the dressing to emulsify so what I would end up getting would just be oil with a hint of acid in it. I always had to ask the servers to mix the dressing before serving, pretty please.This past visit, I ordered the Reuben and subbed coleslaw for sauerkraut. Honestly, the Reuben was just not good at all. Firstly, the corn beef was dry AF and had little to no flavor. They also forgot the Russian Dressing on both me and my friend's sandwiches which was a huge disappointment because we asked for it on the side later and it DEFINITELY made the sandwich more palatable. I don't understand why they would leave off the dressing, that's like the best part?! Maybe they put a little on the bread and it melted?? Either way there just wasn't enough of it to taste it at all. The coleslaw in the sandwich did not agree with my tastebuds. I only got one note from it, which was sweet. The end. We also ordered the latkes which were super doughy. I'm not sure how they're usually supposed to be served, but the ones I've had in the past were hella crispy and good. These were not. The brisket chili that I used to love didn't taste as good as it used to. It was definitely salty but I was confused because there was chicken in it and I couldn't find the brisket... The best part of our meal were the bagel chips. I asked for more and our server happily said sure, whisked away the plate and it was never to be seen again.

The lines can be long, but all good brunch places in the city (see Paramount on Charles St for a prime example) have similar if not worse delays.The stuffed french toast, although a little too mashed and sweet for me, is excellent.

We had the papas for an app, the cheese and pepper sauce over the simple sliced potatoes, amazing. Then we all had variations on their signature chicken.

The plantains, well, I could eat them all night long, and the passionfruit/pepper dipping sauce, just finishes them wonderfully. Also can't forget the great sauces: red pepper sauce (spicy w/some vinegar), green (cilantro, peppers), and my favorite the yellow pepper sauce (it's like mayo, mustards and spicy peppers all in one, incredible).

I have never been to even a chain restaurant that served ice cold red wine... this was bizarre and annoying.

This also took an enormous amount of time and she was the only server. I don't believe she was the chef which some reviews have indicated...who knows.

We beat the rush, thank goodness, but as I saw Joe fraternizing with the customers waiting in like I kind of wished I had been there. I really liked the new area and feel like it is a fine use of the space. The communal tables are fun and are good to force actual human interaction. For the 20 minutes or so it takes you to eat your chicken, just put your cell phone down and socialize with someone! The workers were all very upbeat, especially Joe who was fluttering about between the line and tables and kitchen playing benevolent overlord.I don't really care for the tea, as I am an unsweet tea drinker. I'll skip over that. The ice water was cold and.. existed. Yay for that. You'll need it. The chicken, of course, is wonderful. I order the \\"Holy\\" and I am told most people think it is pretty hot. I found it to be flavorful with the right amount of kick, although I am considering asking for extra holy next time. Call me crazy. The bread underneath is a neat touch and helps soak up some of the flavor as well as keeping you from stabbing your styrofoam to death. The cool house ranch is a great accompaniment to the spicy chicken and really makes the dish sing. As for the sides, well I am that guy who likes vinegar coleslaw over creamy so needless to say, I find the the coleslaw to be amazing. Ma's Mac... eh I can take it or leave it.

The brisket was tender, slightly smokey, and riddled with melty fat pockets. The pork was about the same but with larger fattier patches especially near the bark. The bark was good but a tad saltier than I prefer. While all the sauces were good, I found the vinegar sauce most adept at taking the edge off of the fat and salt, truth be told I ate most of my portion without sauce as I never like using sauce on BBQ unless I have too. The jerk chicken sandwich was near perfect, nice and smokey, not to spicy, great toppings, maybe a tiny bit on the dry side but still delicious sans sauce. The sides didn't really do it for me, the cheesy potatoes were good, but left me craving some real funeral potatoes(with crunchy cornflakes baked on top), the mac and cheese was ok but I like it creamier, the greens were not to my liking.

We checked in and explained that we didn't mind waiting. We were offered a sample of the charcuterie which was DELICIOUS. Seriously, trust me. We started off by each getting a flight of ice wine ($20 each) which included three small glasses (basically shots) of different types of ice wine. For our appetizers, I decided to go with the Canadian Cheddar Cheese soup (tastes totally different sober and not 120 degrees outside during the Food and Wine Festival, $11) and my husband went with the French Onion Poutine ($10). The soup was delicious and the poutine was on point. I had never tried poutine, but this rendition had fries, Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and a French onion gravy. YUM.For our entr√©es, my husband and I both ordered the Le Cellier Filet Mignon ($49 each) which I could have literally cut with my fork. I'll be dreaming of that mushroom risotto and truffle butter for MONTHS!The only concern I had was when I ordered a glass of one of the ice wines that I really enjoyed. Our server explained that the glasses are $12 and the bottles are $39. I didn't realize that the glass was the same size as it came in from the wine flight. I assumed that it would come in a normal wine glass and it would be a normal portion. Regardless, it was still delicious and I would totally do it again.All in all, we spent a little over $200 for the two of us and, in my opinion, it was worth it.

I've NEVER been so disappointed w the service anywhere.  To be told I'm intoxicated after two drinks?  Ha, that's funny because you're a bar right?  It's not named star-playland or star-junglegym?  Well, whatever star\\"bar\\", you can discriminate all you want, the plan was to spend money at your bar, instead slowbar and Morrison hotel got our business (and tips).  Stay classy, and remember, it is a business, you personally don't decide who to serve because they don't look like your crew.  You keep people coming back by actually serving them.

I love it so much I've driven from SA to Austin and back more than once just for dinner.They used to have a lamb ragu pappardelle with minted ricotta that was out of this world, but their menu changes. The first time post-lamb ragu, I took the waiter's suggestion of a chicken dish that I thought sounded a little boring. I was very wrong. The chicken was beautifully cooked and sitting in a flavorful wine sauce. I ate every bite, which is no small feat with their large portions. Most recently I had  a pork chop with risotto because the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu next to the monstrous veal for two (which looked amazing). It was very good but I doubt it was the best thing on the menu. It was the first time I wasn't blown away with my entree, but it was still a top notch dish. My friend with Celiacs swears by their gluten free spaghetti. All of their food is handmade with care.We had the fresh mozzarella as a starter and it was very fresh. The waiter was very helpful with wine selections.They also have awesome coffee and desserts.The service here is truly impeccable. You will never feel neglected or mistreated in this restaurant. There was a screw up on our end regarding a gift certificate and THEY went out of their way to apologize ... for OUR mistake.  You can expect a decent wait during dinner, but there are a lot of cool resale shops in the area to browse. This is a $25+ entree restaurant but you definitely get what you pay for."},{"name":"Gourmeto's Pizza","address":"8216 World Center Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Went to pickup a pizza, watched the gentleman in front of me pay with a credit card.

My dinner partner had the pulled pork sandwich which had great flavor and a little more meat which was in line with the price.So if you go, do not order the 1, 2 or 3 meat plate, unless of course you just want tiny pieces of BBQ meat.Perhaps more generous portions at dinner?

I was a little confused over the listing because the name of the hot pot place in Lansdowne mall with the same suite number is now called Mongolian Hot pot.  The logo still has a little sheep though :)  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I fully expected bad service and that was correct.  It was hard to get the waiters attention for water, chopsticks, napkins.  One time we asked for more water, they brought more empty glasses...I'm not sure if it was the case.  I mean this service is expected if the food was cheap or it was all you can eat...but thats what frustrates me about this place.The food was pretty pricey!  Between the 3 of us the bill came out to be $100!  Really??  So, ok the food quality was really good. I mean the broth (we got the half spicy half not) was deeelicious and loaded with chili and garlic.  I thought I could handle hot food but I must admit defeat here - it was so hot.  The garlic beef was also amazing quality.  The yam noodles were like nothing I've ever tasted - chewy, fresh, delicious.  We also got the assorted meat balls, veggies, tripe, and dumplings but it didn't stand out as anything special.Maybe I'd check this place out for the lunch special but this was definitely out of what I expect to pay for hotpot...especially for the crappy service."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Good quantity.

I don't want to wait behind you in line or have everything run out by noon. But, there's no denying it, this place is the best.The Boston Creme doughnut is the best I've ever had. The frosting is rich and fudgy, the custard is eggy and smooth, the shell is perfectly fried.The half-moons? That's the reason to come here. Unfortunately, after you've had a Lyndell's half-moon, you will never ever be satisfied with a \\"regular\\" half-moon with it's thin smear of waxy irrelevant frosting. A Lyndell's half-moon is like a mini-cake. There's a good 1/2\\" layer of frosting. The chocolate is fudgy and rich. The white frosting actually has flavor. The cake is light and fluffy. I go for the traditional but they now make them in every configuration of frosting and cake flavors.Other standouts:\\n-- Cupcakes. No, not gourmet-ified cupcakes. An honest, regular cupcake. No attempts at fanciness, 100% dedication to tastiness. The strawberry-frosted cupcakes have real strawberries in it. And they don't cost $3 a piece.-- At $12, the Jimmy Bar is one of the best deals in town. A mini chocolate-chocolate layer cake perfect for 2 people who want to \\"have a whole lotta cake right now.\\"-- The molasses and thumbprint jam-filled cookies.-- Seasonally, they have something called a \\"french pastry\\" which is a raspberry-filled, flaky delicious delight. I have no idea what it's real name is but if you see it, get one-- Bismarks. OMG. YUM.-- The lobster tails and cream puffs are just as good as the North End bakeries without all the hassle of the North End.-- The Boston Creme Pie cakes (they come in regular and personal size)Service is friendly and helpful.

I love doughnuts, and frankly, I have no clue why it took me so long to check this place out.It looks like the usual coffee joint I'd frequent when going to school, but the mini doughnuts here set Pip's apart from the rest. The doughnuts are made to order and there are three options available.The Honey & Sea Salt recently won the Portland Tribune's 2013 best doughnut award. Raw honey is used. A simple salty-sweet combo, neither overpowering the other. Cinnamon & Sugar is my personal favorite because I'm just completely biased toward cinnamon anything. Nutella is the one to get if you really want something sinful. Sticky, gooey Nutella on a warm doughnut.While \\"Honey & Sea Salt\\" and \\"Cinnamon & Sugar\\" can be found all the time, the Nutella doughnuts make an appearance on Sundays and after 4 p.m. on other days during summer. Wanting the entire doughnut experience, I ordered a dozen, getting four of each doughnut.I'll just come right out and say it: These are some of the best doughnuts I've ever had. It's all made to order, so your doughnuts will arrive warm and fresh. You're basically biting into a softest pillowy doughnut possible. I don't think there's any way to get the doughnut softer without losing its shape.My gluttonous side wanted me to eat 100 of them. If that order only sets me back about $45, that might not be a bad idea. A dozen minis will only cost about $5; they charge a little more if you're getting some Nutella ones.Instead, my curious evil panda side came out and wondered what each doughnut would taste like with ghost pepper powder. (NOTE: No one told me to do this. I'm just a crazy nutcase.) (Video is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QblENj2i0c)As a note, there's also a cool gluten-free option: Squirrel Bars! No squirrel in here, but a bunch of nuts.The doughnuts blew me away and get my elite stamp of approval.

The ingredients were all as fresh as could be and, as he later told us, mostly bought at the market right down the street.A couple months later, now officially open for business, things have only gotten BETTER. They use good, quality meat, fresh veggies and some seriously brutal jalapeno salsa, and their prices are pretty reasonable. Their breakfast tacos are $2.00 and significantly better than the taco cabana's i had been getting down the street for the same price.

And do yourself a favor and save room for desert. The key lime pie squares may be the best key lime I've ever tasted, and I'm VERY picky about my key lime pie. The pecan squares were good and the snicker squares when combined with the brownie squares were good. I avoided the carrot cake as recommended by previous reviewers. The restaurant is a little dated looking, but it's quaint. The wait staff was extremely friendly and quick on the plate removal. You have to request certain things like the lobster bisque, and it was brought regularly. There were definitely a few things I wouldn't eat. The smoked salmon had a weird taste. The half shelled oysters were tiny, gritty, and salty. The Rockefeller oysters were just nasty. The peel-n-eat shrimp was OK. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. The crab legs were not horrible, but about half were over cooked and hard to crack. All in all, it's a great place to go once. I won't be a regular, but I'm glad I did it once. Go before 6 for sure.

This is the first time I ever got to go to a Chinese restaurant with people from...well, not China, but they were so excited to have us try some dishes that are common where they are from.I am American, so the food prep to me was \\"normal\\" but others talked about how greasy some of the items were, some items were even too salty for them, so it seems, Chinese food isn't as greasy or salty as we Americans think it really is!Anyways, the food was great. Everything we had was yummy, especially the coconut shrimp, peking duck and the dried fish fried rice. The wait staff was a little rude, but they did accommodate us as  best as possible so I will give them that. We initially had come for dim sum but were just a tad too late, no prob, they suggested dim sum like items.Would I come here again?

We did not have a reservation, and was told by the man at the front that it would only be a 20 minute wait. I shrugged, 20 minutes wasn't bad I thought. So I went outside and waited. And waited. And waited. 30 minutes went by, no big deal. I went in to check on my name - to see if we were coming up. He said, you're next! I said great. We sat down inside and another 45 minutes went by without my name being called. Went up there one more time and he ushered us in. I think he forgot my name all together, which was annoying since we had been starving since the 30 minute mark. Being unfamiliar with the city, I didn't know where else to go for a \\"good brunch experience\\" so we stuck out the long wait. Our waitress was very kind and attentive. She provided great service and the food was decent, but it wasn't enough to make up for the crappy wait time. I recomend the hot chocolate. If the wait is long, I'd recomend checking out another place. The food is good, but not so good that I would wait an hour and five minutes for it.

One plus is they offer both brown and white rice.  Another is that the buffet is reasonably priced at $9 per person.  \\nHowever, for me the food quality on the buffet was just not good.  I should mention that I have been to several Nepalese/Indian restaurants in the area lately and thus far Yak & Yeti and Sherpa's Ascent are my clear favorites.  Tibet's food in comparison was very bland and lacking in variety.  The naan was very puffy, more like pita bread than naan.  Most disappointing was the tandoori chicken.  I took a piece but noticed an off smell to it, similar to formaldehyde.  Not good.  Their Saag (spinach) tasted like it was straight from a can.  \\nAnother gripe of mine was that when I went to get Rice Pudding for dessert they were out of bowls.  I waited a bit, and actually saw a server put more rice pudding in the serving bowl, but no one ever put clean bowls out so I just gave up, paid the bill and left.\\nAgain, I'm hoping that this was only the buffet and that ordering from the menu is a far better experience, but I would prefer to just pay more at Yak & Yeti for a much better lunch buffet."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Simplicity at its finest.

Save yourselves! Granted, we went at 3pm, so kind of an odd time of day. But I've had better California rolls from the takeout cooler at Publix. I ordered the Dynamite Roll, which was okay. Not terrible, just completely forgettable, wrapped in a thick pillow of rice that was probably done strategically to mask not-so-fresh fish. Their Dragon Roll, basically a California roll topped with slices of avocado and sashimi, was disgusting. I couldn't bring myself to eat more than a couple of bites. The avocado on top was mushy and brown, the eel on top was overcooked, and the rolls themselves were rock-hard. I couldn't bring myself to try the rubbery, congealed tuna. The piece of salmon that I tried was okay.I don't care what the server told me, there's no way those California rolls were made fresh to order. The cucumber in the rolls was glassy and wobbly, the crab was krab, and the rice was thick, starchy, glutenized and cold, rather than fluffy and light. They tasted and looked exactly as if they'd been sitting in a refrigerator for a day. Like I said, I've had day-old $6 rolls from Publix that were more appealing than these. Even with the Scoutmob deal (the reason we chose to try Strip instead of more known sushi options), it wasn't worth it. I couldn't bring myself to eat even half the dragon roll. I'm surprised I forced down as much as I did, but I just kept trying to give it another chance, hoping the next bite would be better. Not so much. Those rolls looked like garbage, which is where they ended up.My husband got a club sandwich with fries and he liked it fine. It wasn't horrible, just forgettable & on par with Applebee's. (If you want a *real* club sandwich with fries, head to Noni's on Edgewood. Wait, why am I telling you my secrets?)Service--okay. Pleasant, competent, got our order right. But our food (two rolls and a club sandwich) took over half an hour to arrive.Ambiance--the restaurant was loud and dirty. Crumbs on the floor, smudged windows, the general feeling of griminess that I've come to associate with so many places in Atlantic Station. Not really what you want when you're trying to enjoy a meal of raw fish.So, kind of a harsh review. But if you were planning to head to this place for sushi, hopefully now you'll know better.

At our company, if any of the departments has any leftovers from catering or what have you, the leftovers are usually brought to the lunch room to share with other employees on a first-come, first-served basis, which of course means that most items last only a few seconds.  My timing was perfect however, and I was even more delighted when I saw such descriptions as \\"vegan\\" and \\"dairy free\\" written on the boxes as currently, I am unable to eat dairy. This is because I am nursing my daughter, and she can't tolerate cow's milk.So, I packed up a slice of lemon coconut cake for myself and a slice of chocolate for hubby.The lemon coconut cake was unbelievable.  A combination of light lemony goodness with coconut.  It was my dream cake.  Two things I love are lemony goodness and coconut and combined, it was absolute heaven. Hubby thoroughly enjoyed his slice of chocolate cake, which I think was their \\"Chocolate Espresso Ganache\\" cake..a combination of layers of chocolate cake with espresso butter cream frosting, and topped with dripping ganache.Upon further inspection of the website/menu today, I realized that both cakes were not from their vegan menu, and in fact, the lemon cake contained cream cheese frosting, which explains why my poor baby had tummy troubles this weekend. A big oops on my part for not checking before devouring the entire slice in about 90 seconds on Friday evening. But, the cakes were so incredibly wonderful that I am quite sure we will head down to Sellwood soon to sample their vegan selections.  That is, until I am able to have dairy again (in about two years...sigh)."},{"name":"Tropical Cuisine","address":"4899 Old National Hwy","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Great little find in the back of the plaza off the beaten track just a bit.

I returned it to the counter and I was told they'd make a new one.  After a few minutes, I found out they had not even started on remaking a burger. I asked for a refund and we got ready to leave. Then the manager, Daniel Lopez, came over with a replacement burger.  He also handed me a business card explaining that Whataburger does not allow open carry of firearms.  My firearm remained concealed underneath my jacket and he said it was seen when I placed my wallet in my back pocket. I explained that the business card he gave me was not in compliance with Texas law and he said that they were a private business and didn't have to post a sign. While this is technically correct, it's unlike any other business I've seen.  To me, it's much as if they're trying to both have and eat their cake.

Only when we got there we realized this must be a very popular place for both visitors and locals, as the estimated wait time for a table for 4 was roughly 45 min to 1 hr, and people were waiting both inside and outside. We though that since it is in such a high demand, it must be worth the wait, and signed up for a table. A very nice feature this restaurant had that I haven't yet seen anywhere else was a text page when your table is ready. Most places give you a pager-like device, that would buzz when your table is ready, but these tend to have very limited range (50-100 m or so), whereas with text page we could wonder off and explore the Saturday market and waterfront, not worrying to miss our reservation.\\nOverall wait till we were seated totalled in about 1 hr 15 min, but then our order also took a while to cook due to kitchen being backed up. The food itself was great and tasty, as most other reviews state. I loved their pork apple sausage and Portabella scramble, and my wife enjoyed a Belgian waffle with strawberries.\\nOverall, very nice place to visit, delicious food and not expensive. If you are visiting Portland and want to put this on your to-visit list, try tricking the schedule and come in between peak times to avoid the wait. We got there around 9:45 am and this seemed to be the peak time. When we were leaving (around 12:15 or so) there was no wait time and some tables were empty, as the lunch rush hasn't started yet.

It goes a bit like this:Donny:  \\"Are these the Nazis, Walter?\\"Walter:  \\"No, Donny, these men are sushi snobs, there's nothing to be afraid of.\\"I'm sure many of you know of what I am speaking.   You see gentle reader, I am anything but a sushi snob.  For sometime I played in a band that also included a crazy Japanese from Nagoya, Japan.  Now to be clear, I am not trying to allude to any great wealth of Japanese cultural knowledge due to this experience, but you pick up a few things. One was his continual amusement at how Americans treated sushi (and I am incorrectly using this term as a catch all for rolls and sashimi as well for ease of narrative) as this mysterious ritual that was to be treated as much as a spiritual awakening as curing a hunger pang.   Although he was quick to say that there were very formal sushi situations, raw fish dishes were completely ubiquitous as fast food fare throughout the country.  An analogy would be treating every meal with beef, from McDonald's to The County Line to Austin Land and Cattle, as the same dining experience. Sushi, at its core, is a relatively simple dish.  It is, at its heart, just a raw hunk of fish, at least what is traditionally thought of when sushi being discussed.  If the fish isn't good, then no amount of vibe, creativity, wasabi, or soy sauce will make a difference.   I've been to Yanagi twice, and both times the fish has been fresh and tasty.   The great thing is that once that foundation is there, everything else is just the cherry on top.Is Yanagi the best sushi I have ever had?  Nope.  Is it a fine example of traditional sushi?  Not really.  Is it pretty damned good sushi in south Austin that seems to be consistent and is reasonably priced?  Yes!  So while that one sushi snob in your circle of friends (and we all seem to have one - and there is a good chance he or she is from the Pacific Northwest, hehe) will probably find plenty to nitpick over, the rest of you will have a good time, have some good food, and leave happy over all.  In particular, I like the Special with the Red Dragon Roll.   It features a large roll and eight pieces of sushi that the chef selects, though it rarely gets very crazy.  Miso soup is complimentary.  This place seems to be getting better with each visit.  I hope they have great success as it is great to have a good option down south.  They also seem truly interested to get feedback, which I think is always a great sign as it shows the business is truly interested in its customers.

If you asked me to rate this a few weeks ago I would give it 4.5 stars but today I have to give it 3 stars based off the quantity they give you now.Prior to sxsw they had veggie dishes for $8.99. I got the panner tikka and it was pretty good for a food truck. In addition, I ordered a naan and it was pretty large. The panner tikka came in a 16 oz plastic container and the rice came in a 12 oz container. For $9 that was an amazing value.Today, I decided to visit it again and I ordered the palak paneer. It was pretty tasty and that's why I am giving it three stars (ACTUALLY I would give it 4 stars for taste) but it wasn't spicy as I asked, doesn't matter it was still damn tasty. What annoyed me was they now charge $9.99 and give you the food in the same 12 oz container as they give you rice in! So not only did they raise their price but they also give you 4oz of less food!! For $4 more, I'm sure I can go to G'raj Mahal which is next door and get much better food and get a larger quantity. Also, they changed their naan, now you get a small naan which looks like the ones you buy from the Indian store in the frozen section."},{"name":"Amnesia Brewing","address":"832 N Beech St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Mmhmm...copacetic ipa'Nuff said.Seriously, the Copacetic IPA is probably my favorite beer in all of Portland.

The slider had plenty of pulled pork, crunchy style coleslaw on a potato roll. It was $3.95 from the happy hour menu, which I thought was very fair for the size and how tasty it was.

I much prefer mentaiko udon from sushi maro or rajio.Takoyaki is definetly a must order everytime like the Alaska roll. Their takoyaki is always fresh and crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside.  Absolutley LOVE this.I also like their spicy tuna sashimi.

We weren't seated near the window anyway and that was ok with me.We had 9pm RSVPs and were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  \\nWe had a pleasant waiter who had a refreshing amount of attentiveness (not TOO attentive/bothersome, but just right).  We had some drinks and bread at our table (always a bread fan, especially when I've waited until 9pm to eat dinner and I am getting pretty hangry).   I started with a wedge salad (good, but hard to mess up I think) and the bf had calamari (which I didn't try but he seemed to enjoy).   Then I ordered lamb chops, and I ordered them medium-well.  Our waiter gave me the \\"are you sure?\\" look, and I assured him I liked my lamb well done versus the more popular rare prep, and he said \\"ok just checking\\" and went on to explain that he liked his well done too.  When they arrived, THEY WERE FANTASTIC!  Perfectly cooked to my liking!  While not as big as the lamb chops at Chops restaurant, they tasted just as great.  I felt like a kid in a candy store.  Or just a girl in a seafood & steak joint who just got some superb chops!  The bf got a salmon dish that he enjoyed too, although I did not try it.  He seemed pretty happy though, and that's saying something as someone who is not all that motivated by food (unlike myself).  We shared a side of mac & cheese, which I gave two thumbs up to as well.\\nAlso, my meal came with two sides and one had run out, and didn't find out until after I ordered.  A manager-looking man came out, apologized, and asked what I wanted instead.  I ordered something, my bf said \\"hey get the lobster mashed potatoes instead\\", I said \\"no, those are extra\\" so I picked something else.  The man said ok, disappeared, then re-appeared a few seconds later and said, if you'd really like those lobster mashed potatoes, we can do that.  So, that's what I got instead.  And for the inconvenience of running out of something likely less tastey, I got them for free! And they were delish.\\nWe decided to order dessert.  We got the pralines dish as it looked like something different for a dessert menu and we loved it!  A sweet waffle cone-like shell filled with soft vanilla ice cream and nuts & berries.  My boyfriend mentioned later in the night how good it was (he's not really a sweets person)\\nWhen the tab came, it was $130.  That included a few liquor drinks, our appetizers, the chops and the salmon, size of mac & cheese, and dessert.  A steal if you ask me!  Ruths Chris in Buckhead, who got everything wrong and was just not that good, was like $180.  \\nI already want to go there again.  I would order exactly the same meal and sides.  I would even wait until 9pm again to have it all!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best Cannoli I have ever had!

First, when I was not ready with my drink order, our waiter took everybody elses and came back for mine. Fine, right, except we had only been there for one minute. Our drinks were on the extreme side of weak. I questioned if they had any alcohol present. When ready to order we were rushed once more. I can be indecisive at times, but in this case I had barely had time to get through the menu. My father had a steak and referred to his \\"medium well\\" as a burnt piece of meat. It was good, but dry and over cooked. My friend ordered a chicken caesar and was surprised when a side chicken less caesar appeared as an appetizer. The waiter replaced it with a complimentary soup since, let's face it, who would want double caesars for dinner. My mom and I both ordered the stuffed chicken. Hers came out fine. Mine on the other hand had nothing inside of it. Who forgets to stuff stuffed chicken??? My mashed potatoes were also extremely dry and had developed some sort of crust like they had been sitting out on my plate for hours.

This is especially true for all you almond croissant fans out there, you get the best part of a croissant (the filling) without having to dig through the layers of flake (I don't care if you are cronut fans, the filling is always the best). Runner-up is the espresso, simply due to the fact that there is coffee.My friends tend to go for pistachio and chocolate chocolate chip as well.

Since Farm Burger moved into the neighborhood, I go there for burgers, locally Georgia-farmed ingredients, including loca grass-fed beef, for HALF the price of a BrickTops burger.

The coffee is pretty good, as well. I'm not sure which coffee roaster, or shop, they purchase their beans from, but it's pretty good stuff.I'm not giving them \\"only 3 stars\\" because I think anything is bad necessarily, but I just don't think that Blue Star is really all that great. I'm typically not one to gripe about the price, but for nearly $4 per-donut, there has to be something that makes your donuts stand out. You're charging a premium, which is fine, but premium quality, flavor, something interesting about your donut(s) needs to be apparent. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.One could argue that the quality is good, and the glazes, and fillings, are unique. I'd argue that the actual donut, sans glaze/filling, isn't that much better than the grocery store. Sorry, in my humble opinion, it's just not. They're not served right out of the fryer at most locations, if any, so they're not warm and soft, and they don't have anything unique about them that separates them from, again, a grocery store.The flavors (icings) are unique, and offer some great flavors, and I will say they're doing a great job on that front, but again, icing is only part of the equation. Even then, I don't really feel like they're absolutely killing it in that regard. They're doing great, but not outstanding enough to warrant the price.I'm sorry.

I started with a plain cannoli with ricotta filling.  It wasn't as good as Modern's version - the texture of the filling wasn't quite right, the shell was too soft, and it didn't taste as fresh.   Next couple times I tried a sfogliatelle and a lobster tail.  Those of you who are familiar with these pastries know that the crust should be flaky with a little bit of a crunch, although not burnt.  Mike's just didn't make the grade - crust was not crispy at all and the fillings were sort of just \\"eh\\"....I've had much better.  But still I keep going back and trying different things hoping to find something that blows me away (mostly because the line moves much more quickly at Mike's than at Modern).   After trying almost everything they make (not all at once, but over time) my favorites are the Florentine cannolis with chocolate chips and their rum nut cakes.  Also the rainbow cookies are pretty good.  They used to be amazing when they made them with 5 layers; now they are just 3 layers.   I guess Mike's figures they don't need to make anything amazing and the customers will keep coming.   This is true only because the line at Modern is so darn long and moves sooo slowly.

She was handed me a chocolate chip cannoli wrapped in paper while she boxed up our other choices in cardboard paper box and wrapped it tightly with string.  The whole time, she seemed just delighted to help us.  My chocolate chip cannoli really did taste like heaven wrapped up in deliciousness. Sweet, decadent, savory heaven in wrapped in light, flakey, perfect deliciousness.  I have never had anything like it. Mike's is a must go for anyone within a 100 mile radius of Boston.

The main dining area was very busy, but we were lucky enough to be seated right away. This wasn't my first time to Mother's, and I love the ambiance of the chandeliers, but today some of that was lost by the noise. Tables were so close together that I literally felt like I was dining with each party. It was hard to keep lunch conversations private due to the proximity of other guests. I'd rather wait a bit and not be jammed into an over-crowded room. The food was good. However, it was not anything I would rave about. It was just a typical breakfast/lunch. The French toast was nice and crunchy and had a nice egg flavor. The Reuben sandwich was slightly dry and could stand for a little more of everything. It was more like a patty melt with a little meat. Increasing the pastrami, sour kraut and thousand island are needed if you want someone to rave about this sandwich. The potato salad that came with the Reuben was good. It was nice and creamy, but under-seasoned. Just an average meal while in downtown Portland. I'm disappointed because I expected better.Update 1/4/17: Stopped in for breakfast today. Had the Migas breakfast. It was filling and very, very good.

It was for a birthday dinner and since we are from Florida, I figured the views would be worth the trip to The Oasis for dinner anyway. We arrived around 6pm on Saturday May 12th, 2018 and were promptly placed on a 1.5 hour wait. We anticipated this so it wasn't an issue. We went to the brewery upstairs and enjoyed some pre dinner cocktails. My party was sat right around the hour and a half mark. We immediately ordered cocktails and appetizers. We were forewarned that the kitchen was slightly backed up but our apps and drinks arrived very quickly. I can't remember the name of the appetizer but it was bacon wrapped chicken smothered in some kind of bbq sauce and accompanied by a jalape√±o ranch. OMG, they were delicious. There were five people in our party and we all enjoyed our main meals. My husband got the chicken/steak fajita while I ordered the fish tacos with rice and black beans. All the food was flavorful, especially the beans. As a Puerto Rican, I enjoy a particularly good batch of beans and although it may be weird to comment on something so specific as beans, I must say they were my favorite! I could have eaten a bowl of the black beans by themselves HAHA. Anyway, I always believe in trying a place despite negative reviews and I'm so happy we did. I had a colleague from work visiting Austin the same weekend who bailed on The Oasis based on the reviews. After I sent her pictures and my approval of the food, she was upset of her decision. She is making plans to go back soon and will add this to her list. I say give this place a try and worst case scenario, you'll enjoy some great cocktails with an amazing view."},{"name":"Bento Hut","address":"349 Decatur St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Staff is young and friendly. \\nTheir portions are pretty big!Good place to hang out with friends or family."},{"name":"New Ginza","address":"63-65 Galen St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"I have lived within walking distance to this place for about three years now, and I have not been as many times as I wish.

It looks like they also have special flavors on the weekends. They are small, but you can get an order of 4 or 6 and be set pretty easily. They are like the donuts at tasty and sons basically, but tastier.The coffee, and almost every ingredient in the donuts is sourced locally. Hyper-locally in some cases; the honey is actually made just blocks from the shop.The service was great, and the owner talked to me about everything that was going on and the ingredients. He's a great guy.I love Annies, but I think this place has them beat on donut taste. Variety, no. This place is just two blocks walking from my house though, so they win.

My girlfriend and I were seated quickly since not even half of the tables were filled and our drink order was taken. Everything went downhill from there. My girlfriend ordered the dungeness crab cakes and a side of mashed potatoes and I ordered a bowl of soup and Carlton Farms Pulled Pork. Firstly, every single dish we received was lukewarm or outright cold. My mushroom soup was good and did have good flavor, it was the one and only redeeming dish of the night. Then we received the entrees. My girlfriend took no more than a couple bites of crab cake and pulled quite a few shells out of her mouth before even finishing half of one crab cake. It took forever to get a server to come over and send it back, our actual server never came to check how our food was and we had to flag down a random waiter. The crab cakes not only had shells but were bland and were cooked poorly (somehow they were charred but lukewarm). She started to eat her mashed potatoes only to find 2-3 dark clumps of something in them. Once again, we flagged down a waiter and had him look at the mashed potatoes. He could not tell what they were in the dim light so he took them to the kitchen to get a better look. He came back and said they were dirt clods!! I don't even know how that's possible but it happened. As I moved from my pulled pork to the mashed potatoes it came with, I fished around in the mashed potatoes and sure enough it had hard, round chunks of dirt as well. The waiter only took my girlfriend's mashed potatoes and crab cakes of the bill and despite there being only five other filled tables it took our waiter 15 minutes to bring my card back!

The flavour was wonderful that it was not as strong and salty as the Burgoo and eggs. The Burgoo and eggs was like a stew with lots of lima peas, lamb, beef, smoked ham, tomatoes, corn, okra, molasses, scrambled eggs, lots of cheese and a warm biscuit. Indeed I felt quite thirty after eating the Burgoo and eggs. It was quite salty. The small biscuit was not big enough to go with Burgoo and eggs. I packed the leftover home to eat with rice. I could eat it with some baguette or bread. Burgoo offers a great variety of sandwiches, salad and soup. It is better than Subway, Quiznos, or the burgers from other fast food restaurants.

If I could leave zero star's I would.

Valet is available; although, many people were opting to park their own cars. The parking lot is not really big, so parking can get a little tight.Once our whole party arrived, we were seated. It's pretty dark on the inside, which I guess sets the mood if you're on a romantic date. As for the rest of us, it was just annoying. Our waiter... hmm, what was that kid's name? Can't remember. He was helpful and explained the menu and all their specials. It took him forever & a day to return to the table, though, for anything. Granted, it was Saturday, so it was quite busy.I ordered the shrimp & grits after going back and forth between it and the seafood sampler plate. We waited a good hour until our food arrived. In my mouth, I knew what it was SUPPOSED to taste like, but once I actually took a bite, I was like, \\"Ohhh... ok. Well, I guess it's alright.\\" It was just \\"alright\\". The grits were too grainy, and I didn't realize I'd have to eat with my hands, being that the shrimp still had the shell on it! :/ It was a small portion of food for $25. Ehhh...  The river view was ok during the last hour or so of daylight. At dusk, restaurant patrons went out to stroll alongside it and had to use their cellphones to light the walkway. They should consider adding lights along the river, maybe? I'll probably visit again for their lunch special. 3 stars, the overall experience was underwhelming."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place fills up fast but if you're around on a Friday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon you may luck out!

I am not a fan of pancakes or waffles. However, this waffle was crispy on the outside and super moist and soft on the inside. The fresh strawberries and cream added that amazing sweetness to the dish. It was the best waffle I've ever had!3. Breakfast Nachos- My cousin Vicky loved this dish the most. I am not a huge fan of potatoes, but loved this. So creative! It's roasted red potatoes saut√©ed with bacon, caramelized onions with sour cream, cheese and green onions. The small chunks of bacon was so good and added a nice crunch. The potatoes were nice and savory and it definitely was a perfect option for brunch!Portion sizes are great!

Came here with the GF and her fam to celebrate her brother's bday. So we had a group of about 10 for lunch. The service here was pretty good, and the venue is unique. That's one of the few positives about Lamberts...The GF and I each ordered their \\"white sangria\\". Quotation marks bc it tasted more like a mojito with a splash of wine. Pretty sorry. and for $10 a piece (it is so annoying when places don't list drink prices...) you get about 4 ounces of sangria in a skinny glass full of ice. I get there is a higher mark up since Lamberts is located DT, but at least give us a good drink if you wanna make them $10 a piece...We ordered the Boar Ribs ($15) and the Broiled Oysters ($16) as starters to share. The boar ribs had great flavor; by far the best thing we tasted. But man, what kind of boars were these ribs from? Are there such thing anorexic boars? There was BARELY any meat on these ribs. Like 1-2 bites each rib. Such a tease... The oysters weren't very good. 6 meh oysters for $16? Pass.For my entree, I ordered the \\"three meat\\" plate with 2 sides ($19). I chose brisket, sausage and ribs. Or so I thought. when you order ribs, you actually only get 1 small ish rib. and you get 2 SMALL slices of brisket. and 1 sausage. Pretty ridiculous/skimpy. The sausage was good, while the brisket and ribs were subpar and both extremely sweet. And did I mention you only get 1 rib and 2 small ass slices of brisket? WTF is that.

I ordered the two bbq meat with chicken and brisket and handmade herbed waffle fries as a side. The beef brisket was moist and delicious but the chicken was dry and the portion was very tiny, about the size of a quail. The chicken also had bones in rather than already pulled.

We had a reservation of course, so they should have been prepared from a staffing stand point.  Alas, our group was grossly understaffed and as such our service was extremely slow.  This was no fault of our single waiter (who had intermittent and unorganized help from some others) who was still covering smaller tables besides our large group.  He was really hustling and doing the best he could.  I do hope his other tables weren't short changed because he was also taking care of our large group.  So, drinks and bread took a half hour to get.  They then took our appetizer orders but did not take our entree orders until after we received our apps.  When food was brought out, it was basically auctioned off where they would call out the name of the dish trying to find it's owner.  Really?  Does the software system not require seat numbers be assigned when entering each dish?  Entrees came out equally as slow, and quite honestly several were lukewarm to cold.  Also, half the group was done eating while others were just receiving their food.  Most everyone did compliment the flavors of the food.  Some were not quite what they had expected and/or ordered, but they said what they had was good.  The wine our table shared was excellent.  I strongly recommend the three mozzarella cheese appetizer, it was excellent.  I can't tell you what exactly was on it however as it was placed on the table without explanation from staff of what the different cheeses were made from, etc.This restaurant has (most) everything it needs to be much better than it demonstrated this evening.  They do have good wait staff, they just need some extra training (how to serve properly, explaining to the customer what is being served, etc.) and the staffing necessary to handle a large group appropriately.  The food is flavorful but I dare say inconsistent with its preparation and timing.  The menu is extensive, if it was pared down I'm sure much of the inconsistency and poor timing in preparation would resolve.  We were there for 2.5 hours and we did not have a manager come by our table to check on us at all.  This was a big fail and their absence really is symptomatic of the root of Parma's problems.I would most likely give them a second try if I were to come in with four or fewer people.

From what I heard about everyone's meal, it was ok. I got the lemon chicken which was good and bad.

My friend who ordered fish and chips said it was ok, nothing special and another ordered mac + cheese which again was ok, nothing too spectacular.

I had a craving for Italian and I'd heard so much about this place, so when I called and they said we could be seated right away, I jumped at the opportunity.Vespaio was a solid performer.  The atmosphere is nice and very convivial, but like Enoteca Vespaio next door, it can be rather loud.  I was feeling gluttonous, so I ordered a mixed grill they were preparing with hanger steak, merguez sausage, and marrow-on-toast.  The merguez was a little gamy for my taste, but if you're a big fan of lamb, the heat is almost right on (I would prefer a little more spice).  The hanger steak was very tasty, and left me wanting more; it was fortunate that my father's fiancee ordered it as her entree and couldn't finish hers.  But after eating a giant plate of meat, I couldn't finish hers, either.  So I took it home in a foil container with the asparagus that she substituted for the fries that normally accompany it, and two slices of bread.  Two days later, I decided to reheat the stuff.  I put the entire foil container in a hot oven for awhile, and when I took it out, the meat was still tender and delicious.  I mean seriously delicious.  If I were to go back to Vespaio, the hanger steak would be at the top of my list of things to order (though having already tried it, I might think about branching out a little).  In fact, I was so inspired by the meat that I went out and bought a slab for experimenting.

The Mac and cheese and the slaw was impeccable probably the best tasting slaw I had as well. Just overall super delicious and satisfying. As far as the establishment, loved the ambiance and the rustic feel. The service was awesome.

I was the only customer here at one point. Even with a staff-to-customer ratio of at least 5:1, I found the service somewhat slow. The Spicy Tuna Roll I ordered arrived in a couple minutes. But, it was at least another 12 minutes before my Oyakodon was ready. By then, I had finished my tea and sushi roll. The sushi here, while small, was extremely tightly made. If you look at the photos, the roll was well crafted. There was no sloppiness or irregularities. The Oyakodon was very generously portioned. At least the rice was. I would've appreciated less rice and a bit more toppings, especially onions and egg. There was so much rice, I couldn't finish it all.....which is a first. Sadly, the price of the sushi is quite high for what you get. That alone will probably mean I won't be back any time soon. But, no complaints about the taste.

The kimchi soup was good, the pork in it was delicious but the soup could be spicier to spice up the flavor a bit. The Bibimbob was also good, I've had better ones but I enjoyed Hae Rim's.Overall the food was great, I think it's pretty similar to Nakwon, but I prefer DJC slightly more."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I took my girlfriend to Little Donkey last night for her birthday and right off the bat I have to say that just like almost all of the other negative reviews, POOR SERVICE POOR SERVICE POOR SERVICE!!!The food at this restaurant was just simply amazing. The prices are slightly higher than expected but that's ok with me if the service was also on par. For start, our waitress \\"Joelle\\" who by the way failed to introduce herself but thanks to my receipt, I got her name, seemed to have an attitude. For start, neither me nor my girlfriend could understand a word of what she was saying at first because she simply talked too fast and was in a rush. After placing several orders, the burger, the lamb bacon wrap, the beriyani, hummus and roasted beets and lastly the fried chicken sandwich. For starters, we got our chicken sandwich within 10min of ordering but then sat for another 35 minutes to get the rest of our food. At this point you would think that the hummus would have arrived after finishing our other plates but no, Joelle forgot to place our order and then denied that we had even ordered it (who does that?) and on top of that gave us an attitude the rest of the night. By the time she got the order in, we were already done and didn't even finish the small plate. After we complained to her about it, she decided to simply ignore us most of the night. What's even MORE ANNOYING than anything is the fact that every bus boy and waitress just wants to clear your table without looking to see or even ask if you are done with your food. Please fix this issue. It's really annoying. We had to ask 5 different people to leave our plates because we simply eat slower and like to enjoy our food. Overall, I loved the ambiance, the food and everything else but the service. It FAILED big time and for the waitress to give us an attitude on a special night, it just ruined the night for both of us. It sucks because we really wanted to love this place. I sure hope the management will look into it."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"The service and wait were so quick and amazing.

I'd heard there was one in Surrey, and decided when I had time to go check out the main Kingsway location. It wasn't terribly busy when we got there but it sure was an interesting crowd. Seating and service was relatively quick.Not knowing what to order, we got one thing we wanted (a broccoli beef arrangement) and asked for a recommendation from the server. Can't remember exactly what it was, but she said it was their most popular item off of the 'chef's special' menu.Well, right from the get-go I was totally disappointed by the food. First, their wonton soup had little to no flavour to it -- but it did have some kind of unidentifiable heat / spice thing that I presume the restaurant is famous for. The wontons were a little spicy too but with no actual taste that I could discern. The consomme was similarly overwhelmed by whatever that spice was.Same problem with the food. There was heat there -- again, some kind of unidentifiable spice -- but zero, zip, zilch on the flavour front. The kicker for me was closing my eyes and trying to taste the vegetables in the chef's special dish... everything tasted the same. Like astronaut food. You know, the kind that looks like peas but doesn't really taste like them. Whatever sauce or flavour thing they put in their sauces totally kills any kind of taste from the ingredients.Honestly, if you want food that tastes different you will get that. Every dish though tasted exactly the same... flavourless, with that sense of spice / whatever in the background that totally destroyed the essence of whatever it came across. It's different, but even after trying I couldn't describe what I was eating nor could I identify any tastes whatsoever.Listen: Green Lettuce, I want my snow peas to taste like snow peas, not snot. My broccoli should TASTE like broccoli, not just some nameless kind of heat that nukes your tastebuds!"},{"name":"Rigoberto's Taco Shop","address":"15855 SE Mcloughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"THE BEST Mexican fast food I've had in Oregon.

I wasn't in love with the prices, but the drip coffee was pretty affordable. Another point of contention I have is that both times I went in their Wi-Fi wasn't working..I was entering the password correctly and everything and kept getting a prompt that their Internet was off and to check the router. So that was kind of disappointing. The staff was a lovely assortment of pretty and friendly people, and I have no complaints there.

The sushi was good, but nothing special. However, our scallion pancakes were entirely forgotten, which is a bit ridiculous considering we were the only patrons in the restaurant at the time and she wrote our order down on a pad and recited it back to us correctly. About halfway through our sushi we asked about the scallion pancakes and the server ran to the kitchen to get the order in. It came out very quickly and they were really hot, so I think they must have just thrown in a raw piece of dough into oil for 1 minute and brought it out to us, so they definitely completely forgot it. The pancakes were a disappointment, raw dough on the inside and GIANT chunks of uncooked scallions; only the outside was fried.

I protested to our server, who dutifully went to the kitchen to get an explanation.Our server explained that the pasta was actually tortelloni and the full serving was six.  I know I'm coming off sounding like a huge pain in the ear, but this bothered me because the pasta wasn't tortelloni or tortellini... It was ravioli!!  That aside, if the full portion is six, it seems a bit meager -- however, full disclosure I'm pregnant and have a larger than normal appetite.  Nothing to accent the pasta (no veggies etc.) just six lonely, warm-ish and overly salty raviolis.My companions did enjoy their meals very much.  SO once the kitchen got the dishes out, things were OK.  I will go back, because I feel that it was a bad night for the kitchen.

We got really snobby about pasta after coming back from Italy, finding that so few restaurants cooked it well. Parma does cook their pasta al dente, so we like this place despite the fact that it's randomly located in Superior, CO. You can make reservations through Yelp which are sometimes necessary because this place can get busy. I love their food, but my only issue is that if I order an appetizer, salad, and entree at the same time (despite my asking for them to be coursed out), they will inevitably come out at overlapping times, which I find irksome. They very efficiently prepare the food, which is good, but the servers are less good about timing the ordering, so I take that into my own hands anymore.We always get the burrata with accoutrements when we go. We've gotten burrata at other (supposedly more legit places) and have liked it less than here.

This is all you can eat lobster and seafood!Wow! What a large selection of seafood! They had peel-n-eat shrimp with cocktail sauce, raw oysters, oyster rockefeller, sushi, crab legs, and of course whole lobsters. They also had a selection of other foods, my favorites including lobster ravioli and braised beef. They give you a bib, bowl for shells, and a large stack of napkins. You are only allowed to get one lobster at a time, which is just fine with me. I went with a hungry stomach and an ambitious goal of eating just as many lobsters as my big boy fiancee. Sadly, I was sorely defeated at just 4 lobsters. But to be fair, I stuffed my face too early with lobster ravioli, crab legs, and their braised beef, which was suprisingly tasty. (Please skip their sushi-- it is totally dry and a waste of precious stomach space). The boy called it quits after 7 lobsters. The lobsters were slightly overcooked, as after they are done cooking, they are placed in a heated container to make sure they are warm when we eat them. Since we were one of the first ones at the restaurant when it opened for early bird, there wasn't enough lobster turnover for us to get the lobsters right when they had actually finished cooking. But it didn't bother me much for all you can eat lobster. Even though I was the fullest I had ever been in awhile, I had to seek out the dessert bar. They have a small dessert bar, but which actually had a large selection of simple desserts, including key lime pie, rice krispy treats, cheesecake, and a snickers-type bar, among others. On my way back to my table with my full plate of desserts, I spied from the corner of my eye a little girl eating ice cream. What. I didn't see no ice cream! After some creeping around the restaurant and some help from our nice waiter, I located the ice cream bar. It is hidden; from the main dining area, you must pass the restrooms, and the ice cream bar is located immediately to your right in the smaller dining area.

Why I decided to do that carrying four bags of clothes I don't know. Anyway the North End is basically Boston's version of Little Italy.

Originally I was going to go to Mike's Pastry but as I was walking I came across Modern Pastry which had a line out the door. So I said I'll try these guys instead.Now Modern Pastry is a REALLY cramped bakery. They literally have maybe 5 tables at the most so people usually get their treats and get out. This place is as authentic Italian as it gets. Old paintings and nothing but really good looking Italian treats. From FourSquare and Yelp everybody says to get the Ricotta Cannoli so I did and got some Almond Nougat too.The cannoli is the real deal. Very sweet and just the right amount of cheese mixed in. So delicious and much better than the cannoli I had at Patsy's. The nougat was really good too. Basically was like a snickers bar but with almonds. I'll be back for the cannolis.As of right now I would say that Modern Pastry is king of cannoli but Patsy's still has the best eclairs. If you're in the North End go here instead of Mike's Pastry.

There were no other choices, like salad or fruit or something light. My wife wanted a glass of red wine and the chef said she had one, although the drinks menu indicated several. All that bread is clogging my gut. The waitress told me the fatty lamb bits I hadn't eaten were the yummy bits. Animal fat is not only bad for your heart & arteries, it's also where any toxins the animal has in its system are stored. The waitress poured a lot of water. Most of it made it into our glasses.

There were also a few plantains served on the side.  I have never been a fan of the unripened fried specimen of the banana family so I didn't really eat those.We also ordered the Guajillo Corn Enchilladas -which were filled with cheese, shredded beef brisket and topped with Green Tomatillo sauce.  This was also served with rice and beans (pinto).  I thought this was really tasty.  The brisket was tender, and the tomatillo sauce was excellent.  I kind of wish I had ordered more of that sauce.  The rice and bean were....well rice and beans.  Nothing special about that. The wait staff seemed a little unconcered and came every once in a blue moon.  I really didn't have a problem with that in this case because we really didn't need much.

Our family of 4 received fast service, the restaurant itself is very clean, the staff friendly and the food was very good.  For this reason, we decided to return tonight.  My son and I are just finishing up a father/son week spent at Disney and Universal Studios.  I was growing tired of the overpriced meals at the theme parks, so,we cancelled our Disney restaurant reservations and sought out a place to order food for carry out on our way back to our resort.  Ribs sounded good to me, and they had a large selection on the kids menu for my son.  I placed an online order as we were getting ready to leave Disney.  When I arrived at the restaurant, I found out that there was some confusion with the online order.  The restaurant had been using the Chow Now site/app for online orders.  What I didn't realize is that they have three locations, and only one accepted online orders, and it wasn't the Irlo Bronson Hwy location.  It was really a calamity of events that really can't be blamed on anyone person or entity.  If anti, it was my fault for not knowing their area.  Regardless, I showed up at what ended up not being the location where my food was to be.  The manager and bartender were very understanding.  They took my order again, called the other location to sort it out, expedited our new order prep, and gave my son a Sprite while we waited.  In addition, the Manager stayed and talked to us the entire time until our food was ready.  That was above and beyond in my opinion.  All of the staff was extremely friendly.  The food was still a perfect temperature when we arrived back at our room in our resort, and the food was excellent in my opinion.

I came to Lee's once to try a bahn mi for the first time some point in my first two years in Atlanta, and only finally returned today. WHY??? My eyes were bigger than my stomach and/or I was making up for lost time when I ordered egg rolls along with the pho/half bahn mi combo. Doesn't matter, it was like $11.32 with tax and I got to take what I didn't eat home to go back into a second food coma at dinner.When I came here the first time I just took my food to go, so eating there was an interesting new experience. As it got closer to noon I kind of felt bad we were taking up a table because it was getting pretty busy. And they bring you your food so fast it's kind of easy to feel bad about sitting around for an hour in total. So I ordered the regular egg rolls, and they were okay. I saw when we were paying that they just sort of keep them there in a case. I didn't care for the fact they were room temperature, but they were decent. I ate those there, along with half the pho. It was decent, it's no [choose your predominantly pho joint here] but when a good sized bowl of it and half a bahn mi is just over $7.50, no complaints here. They give you the usual suspects to throw in, though I thought it was odd jalapeno was not one. That's okay, they have chili paste at the table and that is easier to handle anyway.The bahn mi though, even after keeping it for roughly 7 hours in the fridge, SO GOOD. And I can't believe what I just ate was a mere half. I took the cilantro off and did put the jalapeno on, and it wasn't too painfully hot since sometimes I can never tell how a jalapeno is going to be. I regret not taking my friend's, ha. The pho was great reheated too, dare I say even better then. I think I would definitely prefer to take my food to go here, it helps also that it makes it cheaper...which I find interesting because I would feel you'd charge more for the disposable containers. Either way whatever, everything is still so cheap. I didn't think the service was really unfriendly, in fact, I was kind of surprised how friendly they were. When I asked to take what was left to go, they took my bahn mi and wrapped it up all nicely. I do my laundry at a place on Buford Highway and that HAD been my intention if I hadn't decided to overdose on food. So now I need to come by again this week and make up for even more lost time with another couple of bahn mi."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When in Boston, don't miss it!

The spread was good, but the corn soup was incredible, balancing unexpected and delightful flavors (watermelon and peanuts!). The potato special was earthy and comforting, although not quite as memorable.From there we moved on to lamb and chicken entrees respectively. Rather than waste time explaining how enjoyable these dishes were, I'll simply tell you to try them. You don't know me, but you will thank me. Seriously, these were on par with (possibly exceeding) the best that Boston has to offer. We concluded the experience with after dinner drinks and a very fresh peach-rhubarb cobbler. The complimentary goat's milk fudge topped with sea salt sent us out the door smiling.Overall, the experience was wonderful and I seriously doubt that you'll find anything to surpass it for the price.

Non of us wanted to cook, so we decided this would be a fun option given the variety of food they offered.  We were also interested in the river views and general atmosphere.We arrived and there was quite a crowd!  The valet did a good job of keeping everyone moving.  We made our way to the hostess station and were seated after about five minutes.  We had a placeholder reservation on the books for 11:45.  An earlier reviewer complained that his \\"reservation\\" was not honored and that he had an hour-long wait.  It should be noted that these times were not reservations per se, but were instead placeholders that would allow the party to have priority in line at that point in time.  This may sound like a semantic difference, but it's important.  Since the meal was buffet-style, it would be difficult to have specific reservation times because people might stay for varying amounts of time.  The reservation wasn't for a specific time to be seated, but for a priority spot in line.  The email was clear on this point.Having said all that, it sounds like the crowds may have caused a back-log later in the afternoon.  I can't comment on that since we went earlier, but we didn't have any problems in the morning.  They should probably consider better crowd estimates late in the day next year.Okay, with all that out of the way, how was the dining experience?  Overall, everything was great.  There was an enormous variety of food, ranging from breakfasts and southern favorites to traditional Thanksgiving food and seafood. It was all pretty good, especially for a buffet-style meal.  There were tons of desserts and good drinks, including bottomless mimosas. I don't want to spend too much time going into detail on the food, since it's not the standard fare.  It was good for Thanksgiving, though.  Another highlight of the venue were the views of the river.

All the yes!  The meals come with a side of mac & cheese and cole slaw.  I am a mac & cheese snob.  Where I stand, my father makes the best mac & cheese in the world and I pretty much hate it anyone elses.  This one is comparable to my father's and I couldn't believe it when I took the first bite.  I don't even mind the colesalw because it's vinegar based with a little peppery kick.  The banana pudding is also good.  A little sweet for my liking, but good, nonetheless.  They have free water and sweet tea.  Not only is the food good, but the service is amazing.  I feel like I'm with family when I go there.  When the lines are long, they always have someone handing out menus and explaining the process to first timers.  They also donate the remaining food they have for the day to local Faith Mission shelters.  The only thing I wish were different were the hours.

As for the remaining 3, we took them home and ate them the next day.  They were a bit soggy, but still good.We also got the chocolate and walnut brownie.  Best brownie I've ever had.

Big booths, and a bar seating area, great set up of LCD TV's, and they are always playing the right games! However, you walk through the hallway, and it opens up to a huge seating area, and has the smell and remissness of an 80s night club. It is so outdated. I recommend sitting in the front bar, service is fast, and friendly. It seems once you walk through the hallway, it's a different world. The service is the worst service, I have ever encountered in a restaurant. The servers, are either friendly, but usually new, and they let you know that they haven't had a break, they are confused, unaware of the daily specials. \\nOR\\nThe servers have worked there so long, they are miserable. They treat the customers horrible. They are rude, and argumentative. Food? hmmmm, it's ok. It has gotten better over the last few months.I recommend the pulled pork pizza, and go on Sunday, they are 1/2 price. Burgers are not good, they lack flavour, and usually taste burnt.

What a fun place to go! As you probably have seen in other reviews, this restaurant is located ON PDK Airport. They have a lovely little balcony that lets you watch the planes take-off and land about as close as anyone can be. It's a great place for a date, especially on Friday night,  when it's adults only. The atmosphere is rather warn and casual, but it's a welcome change from the stuffy uppity restaurants of Brookhaven. The food at downwind is a mixed bag, but almost always positive. I have had some excellent food, specifically the Grouper Reuben, BLT, and their Cordon Bleu (it was a special).  Some things are less impressive, but still tasty - such as their burgers and spinach dip appetizer. Prices are really good for the area and a good value for the amount of food you get. Draught Beer selection is pretty weak. They used to have at least one solid IPA, but now has been reverted to the common light beers.  But overall, the experience is always delightful at the Downwind. If you are the type of person that doesn't need fancy or 'elevated' food, the Downwind is an excellent choice for unwinding after a hard week while providing a unique dining environment. Pros: \\nGreat location, Good-to-excellent food, Not fancy/uppity, good prices, Adults only 'date night' on Fridays.Cons: \\nFood quality can vary, Atmosphere is a bit old with semi-working A/C, weak draught beer selection."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went to Superica last Friday night around 7:30.  You can tell they're still working the kinks out since opening due to some general confusion around seating and service.  I went with a friend and  we waited about 2 - 2.5 hrs from walk in time to being seated at a table.  Once seated it took about 10 minutes for us to get water, but fortunately chips were brought immediately upon being seated as my friend was about to pass out from hunger.I suspect there was some issue around their reservation system as larger parties that seemed to come in after us were seated within 40 minutes while we languished right next to the hostess station with constant reassurances of being seated \\"shortly\\".  As we went during prime dinner time and this is their first week, your experience will vary most assuredly.  However, I'd be lying to say it didn't sour my experience. In the management's defense, they did realize this was not optimal and provided complementary menu items of our choice to us.I liked the decor quite a lot.  It had a rustic feel but while still feeling slightly upscale.  A large number of low wattage bulbs creates a soft glow in the dining area which created a nice relaxing atmosphere for me even with servers rushing around us with trays full of glasses and dishes.We ordered:\\nBob Armstrong queso: I found the queso it self to be a little thin and lacking in any flavor.  All the flavor of the dish came from the ground beef in the middle, which honestly tasted like standard taco ground beef flavor.  The dish also contains dollops of guacamole and sour cream sitting in the queso, but as I'm not a fan of either they didn't enhance the dish much for me. I'd suggest passing on this one.Ceviche De Camaron: This item was amazing! The shrimp tasted very fresh and the sour lime flavor made the dish taste very refreshing and light.  The tostada was crisp and crunchy, a perfect platform for the veggies and shrimp. Definitely a must try.Tampiquena: This was skirt steak, with 2 cheese enchiladas topped with an over easy egg.  The portion of steak was very generous and cooked exactly to order (medium).  I found the charred flavor noticeable and pleasant without being overpowering.  The steak was firm without being overly chewy which I've noticed can happen with other skirt steaks I've had.  Also of note, my friend said the steak was slightly salty, but I have a bit of a salt-tooth so I found it to be an excellent.. The enchiladas were firm and flavorful without being too heavy and the egg added to the flavor nicely. 3 Tacos (a la carte): Carnitas (pork belly), Chicken Carbon, and Barbacoa (brisket).  The Carnitas taco was head and shoulder above the other 2.  Juicy, savory, and flavorful.  The Chicken was wood fire grilled and was excellent where there was charring but about 1/2 of the chicken didn't seem to have a significant amount and was just okay as a result.  The Barbacoa was unremarkable, not bad, but I'd have rather had another Carnitas ... or 3 ... or a dozen (I should stop now).The meal comes with complimentary chips as well as 2 kinds of salsa.  A spicy guacamole based one and what appeared to be a more traditional tomato based one.  The guacamole one was alright, but I didn't like the consistency very much, but I'm not a big guacamole fan to begin with.family style Rice and beans were included with the main course as well.  The rice was soft but lacked any flavor.  The beans were much better and very creamy.I also must mention the pricing.  You will definitely be paying a premium for the trendy location in the Krog Street Market and dining room atmosphere.  Most of the items seem to be 50-100% more than you'd pay for similar dishes elsewhere.  And as with all other locations inside KSM, you'll be dealing with the dismal parking situation of the area (at least in my opinion).  All in all, I had a mixed experience which was saved by the attentiveness of the hostess and their willingness to make up for the ridiculous seating situation I experienced.  Its definitely a place you should give a try at least once, but you might want to wait a week or 2 first."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It was a donut filled weekend so why not add Pips to that list also.

And then another 10 or so for the donuts. You could tell there were a lot of tourists there - probably more than locals. Anyways we got a dozen donuts, two of each of their 6 flavors they had that day. And I got a small Emmylou chai tea. It was super chai-y. Haha, with a hint of lavender. I tried my friend's Ginger rogers and it was too ginger-y for me. As for the donuts, these are mini cake ones that you can eat in two bites. The donuts are all the same base but then they top it with honey or chocolate or cream or whatever. We had the cinnamon sugar, raw honey & sea salt, nutella & sea salt, dirty wu, candied bacon and maple and the meyer lemon pear butter. It's about $6 for the dozen too so 50 cents each isn't too horrible. I think my favorite was the meyer lemon followed by the cinnamon.

I came in was immediately greeted within a few steps of the door. She gave me several options on top of what I would like to order not to upsell me but to give me more options available to me. Without asking I was given a happy hour menu and also given recommendations on her favorites and asked questions to see what would entice my flavor palate. She followed up with me on a regular basis and was equally as friendly to other patrons at the establishment which shows she really knows her craft. For my happy hour options I chose the chicken strips with fries, the rib basket, and also an order of wings. Not that I was hungry but I wanted to be able to try a few things out in order to give an unbiased review. Chicken strips are handmade by the bar itself. Crunchy on the outside yet juicy and tender in the middle. The fries were not overly cooked and was very flavorful and came with ranch but she also gave me option on other sauces as well. The ribs were a little on the dry side but were still very tasty and worked well with my alcohol selection. As for the wings, the sauce definitely steals the show. a very nice buttery buffalo sauce in an ample size wing served with celery and dressing to cool the heat down.

Unfortunately, neither was true of this table.  The place was empty yet our waitress took forever to arrive and greet us.  My boyfriend order some clam chowder as an appetizer.  It arrived as a bowl full of cooked clams, potatoes, etc with the waitress carrying a pitcher full of cream.  She plopped the bowl of \\"stuff\\" on the table and then poured the cream over it.  Now, this was an interesting way to present the chowder in a town where every restaurant boasts \\"the best chowdah in Boston\\" but what Great Bay's chowder gained in presentation, it lacked in taste.  It tasted exactly how it was presented - a bowl full of cream with clams and potatoes floating around; not the rich creamy chowder we love.  The seafood was good without being spectacular.

I did try the chocolate glazed chicken wings, as tasty as that may sound to those seeking something new, it honestly wasn't as spectacular as it sounded. The chicken wings are glazed in their dark chocolate stout which takes an acquired taste, although they do offer free samples of the stout. If you really loved the stout, I'd recommend the wings then.Other than that the burgers and desserts are really great! I got the \\"may contain bacon burger\\" which spoilers does contain bacon. Mhmmm pork belly. There desserts take a while to come out but it is worth it! I ended up getting the chocolate mousse...mmm chocolaty smooth. The best part is that compared to most other places around city walk and for the service you get this is actually pretty affordable, not to mention to have a theming you may not see too often.

After that they start asking you if you want something from their cart - you can see the food + they explain it to you. For this reason it is quite easy to understand each dish. Once you pick something they write it down in a paper which will become the bill later. It is all in chinese so that is a negative aspect. Food is good, service is very fast so it is easy to go in and out quickly if needed.

My fiance ordered 2 rolls, and I ordered the sushi deluxe, which is nigiri and a roll. In about 7 minutes I received my salad and miso soup.20 minutes after placing our order our waiter told us it would be a wait, but that our food would come soon. We were both in a very good mood, and received the news patiently. We noticed that there was only one sushi chef, and that he was working very hard on to-go orders.40 minutes after placing our order a waitress approached our table and gave us free edamame. She told us that it would be a long wait. We were still in a good mood, and were friendly when she approached us. We noticed that the chef was still working on to-go orders, and that the 2-top right next to us had received 3 rolls that they had ordered after us.1 hour and 10 minutes after we placed our order, my fiance lost his patience. He noticed that the sushi chef was working on a boat, which meant that he wasn't even working on our order. He prompted me to ask if they had started our food. Our waiter asked the chef, who yelled at him. Then our waiter sheepishly told us no, they hadn't.I got up and said, \\"You've been nice, but it's been more than an hour, and we're leaving.\\" My fiance and I clinked our glasses, threw back our beers, and walked out.Country Bistro should 1) notify to-go and pick-up orderers that there will be a very long wait, and prioritize the orders of dining-room customers first, and 2) better manage its food production. There's no reason that after 20 minutes we couldn't have received 1 of our rolls, after another 20 minutes received the second, another 20 received the third, and another 20 received the nigiri.We came to this restaurant for date night, and after \\"dining\\" at this restaurant, we felt stood up."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Used to be a great stand by for yummy breakfast food in the hood.

They have a wide variety of flavors and the cannoli's are huge! I also ordered some rainbow cookies and they were just ok. They were large but the layers of cake were too dry for me. I've definitely had better rainbow cookies. The one thing I didn't like about this place was the service. I wanted to know how many pieces (estimate) are in 1lb of rainbow cookies and the server gave me an attitude. I then asked if I can get a 1/4lb (I just wanted a few pieces to try) and she was very rude in her reply saying that it equals to probably 2 pieces and I should just tell her how many I want instead of ordering by the pound (when it is sold by the pound). I don't understand how she was able to know there would only be 2 pieces in 1/4lb but didn't know how many are in a lb. I just wanted an estimate and I expected for someone who seemed like she's worked there for awhile to know. Anyway, she didn't have to be rude about it or had an attitude.

Lobster tails are amazing as well, light and sweet cream in the center with a light flakey crust on the outside.  However, outside of these items nothing else is really that great.

If you don't want to eat a cannoli go for the ricotta pie and anise cookie. I think the ricotta pie is the real star as far as desserts are concerned. Sweet, satisfying, and heavy without overfilling you. The ricotta pie also makes a great breakfast. As for the anise cookie, they sell them by the pound ($9/pound).

The only good thing about this place is the view, that is IF they want to give you a table with a view. The food was ok. I ordered a chicken salad on top of avocado and spinach. It said it had black beans, but I think it literally only had 4 black beans in it. Lol. I love black beans and I was a bit disappointed of how little it had. \\nCustomer Service needs a lot of work."},{"name":"China Pearl Restaurant","address":"9 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I have to admit, I wouldn't come here if i have the chance to, but for some reason... my aunt chose to come here that day.

The service is great, both Vinnie and Carlos were delightful and very helpful when it came to suggestions. I actually had breakfast the next morning here as well, so I'll split it up:Breakfast: The brown Sugar pancakes and the bacon was a perfect choice if you don't eat to go for the buffet. If I was hungrier and didn't have a meeting following breakfast I would have chosen the buffet, a great selection at a great price. Dinner: They bring out warm bread and butter once you are seated, great start. I started my meal with their award winning Clam Chowder, it was worth the award it received...seriously. I also ordered the Lobster Rolls, they had a strange taste to me and I didn't eat them, but the presentation was nice and the bread was soft and fresh. To top off my meal I ordered the Apple Cider Mimosas, so tasty!"},{"name":"Ray Ray's Hog Pit","address":"2619 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Coming from Memphis, I've had my share of BBQ. I'd say that this is the best hands down that I've had in the city. It spanks Hoggy's and City Barbecue, even if it is served out of a trailer in a parking lot. We tried the pulled pork and the brisket. As I watched him cut the brisket right in front of us, I almost changed the order to be two of those sandwiches. For sides, we ordered the classic mac-n-cheese and a banana pudding. I was quite disappointed to get home and see that we received 2 macs rather than the side of pudding. The mac-n-cheese was definitely not impressive--there was way too much sauce and it was overly creamy.

From the ownership, to the service, down to the ambience this place is nothing short of wonderful. A little bit west of Austin, Texas, this place makes for a wonderful day trip or evening away. They have plenty of land to accommodate for picnics, outdoor events, and kids sporting events. We started the afternoon with a tasting, led by the owner of Treaty Oak, Mrs. Alice. From the minute we got there she was incredibly helpful and guided us through the tasting. The tasting calls for three different types of alcohol, but we ended up able to sample almost everything they have. Drinks aside, Mrs. Alice knows her stuff in an out- any question you may have she could answer. The tasting experience blew us away and honestly left us kind of sad when it ended. I had never taken part of such an immersive tasting and I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in checking this place out. After the tasting we ended up at the Rickhouse, where they have picnic style seating and an assortment of drinks. Even there, the bartenders were great and helpful in picking drinks.In all, this place is a must go for Gin enthusiasts, and something I would encourage everyone in the Austin area to go to.

The decor is sort of Cape Cod meets something, i don't know what the something is, though.  Lots of weathered gray wood and paintings of the coast.  It looked like a decent list of stuff on draft, but none of us were in the mood.  The menu was on the spendy side for lunch (there isn't a lunch menu), but we were already committed.  i had spaghetti and meatballs, and was honestly pretty psyched.  i like spaghetti and meatballs.  Heck, i like Spaghetti-O's and frozen meatballs.  And basically that's what this tasted like.  Only more watery.  And it cost $10.

I don't usually get salads because they are one size fits all, and if you don't want something on it, you don't want a salad.However, the salad bar is in the back next to the bathrooms. Probably not something they thought about when they put it back there. I'm not too bothered by it, but I understand why some are.The pizza isn't glamorous, but that's not why you're coming here.

Next, there are less flavors so the chances of a dud flavor go down. Personally, I prefer the many flavors at Mike's and they are bigger. Nonetheless, you cannot go wrong with Modern Pastry.

That said, they have the biggest variety of options and interesting flavors although it's disappointing they don't fill all cannolis to order (though that's understandable considering the variety they have). \\nMost recently we tried the Boston cream pie, nutella cannoli, and the Florentine. The Boston cream pie was good, but nothing to write home about. Nutella cannoli is a great option for chocolate lovers and Nutella aficionados alike. The Florentine has a candied shell and was a bit too sweet for my taste, although it was still tasty. I would, however, go to Mike's over somewhere else if I wanted to give cannolis to someone else.

The grounds are very clean and parking is free which is a plus. I was not really looking to shop for souvenirs or at specialty shops, but my out of town friend was in his glory visiting the World of Disney and the Christmas Shoppe. I stopped by Dockside Margaritas for a break and I really enjoyed just relaxing next to the lake in the middle of DS. There are plenty of stores to visit and many restaurants for whatever your taste may be. I didn't get to ride an amphibious vehicle, but this is on my to-do list for next time. My best advice is to be ready to be ready to pay Disney prices for food, drinks and attractions around the Springs. But enjoy it. It's beautiful.

The paint had been updated and the buffet stuff that had sat there for years was gone.  All of the nice round tables w/ tablecloths were gone and now just cheap laminate covered tables like you'd find in a Burger-Tex remained.  All of the cool art on the walls had been removed, with nothing in it's stead.The major problem:  Upon entering the building we noticed an odor, like a backed up septic tank.

Pretty sure our turkey was the last of the day (and horribly dry). The prime rib was tasteless. The sides were few and far between, and were stone cold. This buffet wasn't worth $20, let alone the $50 they charged. I feel sorry for people with later reservations, I imagine they ate grocery store chocolate chip cookies, stale bread, and cold green bean casserole (or perhaps the waffles and French toast sitting out hours after their breakfast buffet ended). Wait staff told us this was the first time this particular chef and GM arranged a Thanksgiving buffet--and it should be their last. Too many reservations were made, the place was CRAWLING with guests, and the food wasn't fit for a Golden Coral. Waitstaff was surprisingly helpful and kind despite the chaos that undoubtedly was happening behind the scenes.

The biscuit was store bought not house made and on grilled for appearance and was both cold and cakey. Greek diner or not if you're in the south you should offer a good biscuit.

We got chips and salsa which were good.\\nYou get your drinks in souvenir cups which is cool.\\nI ordered nachos which were huge but taste was bland. Hubby ordered enchiladas which he enjoyed. Overall, I would not here again.\\nMaybe the one experience is fine if you really want to check it out, besides the view, there's not much else.\\nIf they could cut the wait time and actually seat people in the empty tables, it would be great.\\nDon't come hungry for sure lol"},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Upon arrival, the line was almost out the door. The decor inside is very picnic-like so seating can be a bit tricky but almost forces you to step out of your comfort zone by squeezing in between people for a seat. The place was clean and they ran it like a well oiled machine. I like that the menu is simple and to the point. I opted for the chicken breast (sandwich) and got \\"warm\\" as my heat level. Mac and cheese for sides and FREE sweet tea which I thought was pretty damn good. The chicken breast itself had great flavor but the mac and cheese was pretty cold once I started digging into it. I wish I would have gotten some banana bread pudding but I'll be sure to on our next visit. Overall, I liked this place. Wish they had some more options for sides but I can appreciate the simplicity of their menu. Only reason I'm knocking off a star is because I truly believe my boyfriends version of Nashville hot chicken is better."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've been to Lambert's several times on my trips to Austin.

We told them the food was mediocre but you only go there for the sunset. So we showed up 1 hour before sunset and we requested an outdoor seat to view the sunset and we were told it'd be a 30 - 40 min wait. We were fine with it and checked out the gift shop. 10 min later our buzzer goes off. Great! We'll sit early! So the girl takes us to the table and not only is it back by the window it was behind a pole... so we ask if we can sit at the clean, empty table not far from us. \\"Oh... that one's already taken, but you can be put back on the list.\\" So we go in to wait for a new table. My husband asks how long and the girl says 30 - 40 min - she put us back at the very end of the list instead of the top. So my husband says let's go, we won't get to see the sunset and that's the only reason we came here and started leaving. Then suddenly they had a table around the corner and the manager had the server show us the table. It was in a great spot so we stayed. However after the server got us our drinks, it took 20 min before he took our order that he still got at least 1 dish wrong and had to be correctedNeedless to say, this is a place you only go once or if you have visiting relatives.

Her parents said it was even better than the food they had in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago when they were visiting her sister who works in the restaurant industry. Way to go, Vespaio.Seriously though, it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time and I say this even though it was during my no cheese phase. A meal that's awesome without cheese is absolutely incredible.We started off with the complimentary bread basket that comes with Cannelini bean spread, blue cheese and pistachios from the Antipasto case, and the appetizer of the day which was freshly made mozzarella cheese with salami and focaccia. I couldn't have either of the cheese dishes, so I ate a large amount of bread, and let me just say that the wheat bread is delicious. I think it has some kind of nut in the dough and it is almost sweet, which pairs well with the mild white bean spread. As far as I could tell everyone else enjoyed the appetizers, though my girlfriend did mention that the mozzarella had little flavor (which I think is just how fresh mozzarella is and is also why it is so glorious). We ordered a bottle of wine as well, but I know absolutely nothing about wine, so I have nothing to say other than, as usual, I had a glass and a half and felt tipsy.For my entree I had the Big eye tuna grilled rare with spicy Sicilian salmoriglio with crispy organic white polenta & Kalamata olive, roasted tomato & arugula salad (yes, I just copied and pasted that off of the website), and seriously, it was SO delicious. The tuna had a mild flavor that went so well with the pepperiness of the argula and the saltiness of the olives. Also, those polenta sticks were INCREDIBLE. They were very creamy and the batter on them was very light, so I successfully consumed all three of mine. My girlfriend's dad (and this is how I refer to them in real life (not to their faces, obviously) because I am too nervous around them to call them by their names even though I'm 23.) ordered the hanger steak and LOVED it. He said he was going to dream about it that night. It came with French fries (though the menu likes to be pretentious and call them \\"patate fritte\\"), and they were some of the best fries I've ever had. They were very light (so you could eat a bunch), salty, and kind of sweet. My girlfriend's mom had the prosciutto-wrapped jumbo shrimp (the menu likes to call them \\"prawns\\", which makes me think of being on a British Airways flight. Like, the came out of the GULF. Have you been to Galveston? They're shrimp.) and declared them the best she's ever had. My girlfriend ordered the pasta with caramelized eggplant and liked, but wasn't gushing about it like the rest of us were.Though we were all reasonably full, we opted to order desert and shared the pistachio donuts and the sorbet of the day. The pistachio donuts are awesome. To me they tasted the way you always hope funnel cake will -- sugary, cinnamony, doughy, and a little cakey. The cherry compote was amazing. The flavor was very bright and intense and cut through the thickness of the donuts. The sorbet of the day was chocolate and it was superb (I'm running out of superlatives). The flavor was so concentrated and distinct -- kind of the way I would imagine very dark coffee beans to taste if they didn't taste like coffee (that makes no sense, but oh well). It was so good that my girlfriend's dad ordered another scoop to go.Our waiter was very helpful (he figured out a way to successfully transport the sorbet home), but never overbearing. The plates were clearly quickly and our water glasses were always full. It's not a restaurant I would go to for a really romantic date (though my girlfriend's mom has decided that she's going to send us back there for my girlfriend's birthday) because it's a little loud, but I had no problem hearing anyone at our table. The lighting is good (I hate it when places are really dark and you can't read the menu/when places are really bright and you feel like you're in an interrogation room on The Wire) and the atmosphere is pleasant (and I say this even though we sat by the kitchen).I'm sure there's usually a long wait, but we showed up at 6:15 on a Friday night and were seated immediately. It's a little pricey, but I think it was completely worth the quality of the food. Oh, and it's probably not the easiest place to find parking for, but my girlfriend lives right off of South Congress, so we walked. Winners! Anyway, I really can't wait to go back in April.

There were no real pieces of seafood in the dish; more like a sauce over rice with, if memory serves me right, pieces of okra.

However, if you are seeking quality, this may leave you disappointed. My husband and I both ordered plates of fish and chips. When we arrived, there was only one other table of customers and they were already eating. So, after ordering, and waiting a half hour, we were starting to wonder what might take so long to fry fish and fries for the only table at that time. We occupied ourselves by admiring the Dr. Who atmosphere. If we were familiar with Dr. Who, we may have appreciated the atmosphere as more than a run-down slum hole-in-the-wall. When our meals finally arrived nearly forty minutes later, I was eager to eat and was pleased that the fish was warm. Unfortunately, I found it to be oily and the chips were soggy. We both ate our meals (I only had the fish) and agreed that we would not be returning again. Decent fish, but the wait time was disappointing, along with the bland and unappealing food.

Well, were pleased until we actually tried to get delivery.  We called, placed our order, and waited.  And waited.  And...waited.  After an hour and a half, we called to find out what was going on.  No one seemed to know at first, but then it came out that the driver had gotten lost and had tried to call, but the cashier had taken our number down wrong (770 instead of 404).  When the driver called the wrong number, whoever answered told them that our address was wrong (because of course it was--for them!), so the driver turned around.  Okay, fine.  So we asked when the pizza would be coming.  Keep in mind--this is an hour and forty-five minutes into our wait.  The manager said that they were re-making the pizza.  By this time we were really hungry and annoyed and declined the re-make.  The manager got mad and said that it wasn't their fault because they tried to call.  But they tried to call the wrong number!  When my husband told him that that was unacceptable, and that we didn't want the pizza, the manager hung up right in his ear.  The pizza was okay, but not worth that kind of treatment.  It certainly was not our fault that someone got the phone number wrong, and we probably would have been okay if we had just gotten a sincere apology.  But hanging up on a customer?  Just because we had pointed out that it was their mistake and that we didn't want the pizza anymore?  They must have too many customers and are trying to get rid of a few."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"8274 Champions Gate Blvd","city":"Champions Gate","stars":"3","text":"An average Tijuana Flats experience.

However, my experience at Zaftig's has been mixed, and overall underwhelming. We ordered pick ups two nights in a row. The first night we had the matzo ball soup. I liked it a lot. The broth was rich, and the matzo balls where fluffy and tasty. The second night we ordered a full menu, including chicken liver pate, latkes, chicken kebab, mac and cheese, and brisket. I found the latkes pretty good. Maybe a bit too fried, but I like them that way, so I didn't mind. The chicken liver pate was also good. I didn't try the mac and cheese, but the kids devoured it, so I guess it was good. The chicken kebab was probably the best thing: moist and smokey at the same time. What was really horrible (almost inedible) was the brisket. It was so dry and so tasteless that it felt like I was eating a shoe sole. What a disappointment! You cannot have a subpar brisket in a Jewish deli! Another thing I didn't like was the way I was treated while I was waiting for the food. The waitress at the counter was nice, and she told me to take a seat at one of the tables in the front. Then, another waitress came over and told me I should wait standing because they needed to prepare those tables for the dine-in clients. She was very rude, especially because I was there with my 4-year old daughter, so I was expecting a little more empathy. It was 6:45 p.m., and the diner was half empty, so I didn't really see the need to vacate the table immediately. I had also order and paid food for $125, so I think I was entitled to seat while waiting. Bottom line, I will come back and dine in, but I will never take the brisket again. Perhaps I'll try the pastrami, although the experience with the brisket makes me a bit nervous... I still cannot wrap my mind around that epic failure of a brisket."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Enjoyed the experience.

They offer all of their sandwiches without the bread which is usually a bummer, but they give you this rice salad with almonds that is really good instead of the bread. One issue: They ran out of quite a few menu items by 1pm. Im sure with time, they will figure all that out as they are a brand new location.The staff had the typical cognizance of a new location with new staff. Seemingly tripping up and over each other at certain times, but I'm sure they will figure out all the little things along the way. Some people do not know that 99% of restaurants have this issue, its a learning curve.I love the fact that the kitchen is in plain view, you can actually stand two feet away from your food being prepared, but the staff preparing the food seemed a little unhappy, but it was busy and sometimes that throws people off. However, the kitchen seemed to be very sanitary. I saw people wiping the prep stations after pretty much every sandwich being made.The Layout: The layout is more closely related to an Apple store than a restaurant. Very minimal design and nice and bright inside, very inviting. There is a little ledge along the wall for people who like to stand and eat, as well as a communal table, a bar (where I sat) and some scattered tables and chairs.Overall: Great Lunch place with a nice atmosphere but I wouldn't go there for a meeting or to study as its really noisy."},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ordered thru Grub Hub.

I was in Austin visiting some friends and I had asked them to choose the restaurant.   When I saw that it was located in a strip mall area, I was a little concerned.  Walking inside, I noticed how bland the interior was.   Picnic tables occupy most of the room, which I guess is all you need when diving into lbs of crawfish.  There are multiple flat panel TVs, all airing something completely random (There was a movie with Ice Cube playing on mute).  The menu is full of seafood items including crawfish ($5.95/lb), oysters (fried and raw), soft shell crab (in a po-boy or alone), king crab legs, and different kinds of fish.  I felt bold and ordered 2lbs of crawfish of the \\"spicy\\" variation (mild and regular are also available).  Whoo! That is some spicy crawfish!  I lost the feeling in my lips after about half a pound.  The crawfish came with corn and potatoes, both of which were also seasoned and boiled in the spicy seasoning and they were both equally as spicy.  Overall, the crawfish was very good - although I wish they were a bit bigger.   My wife ordered the fried oyster platter, which included 10 juicy and battered oysters served with seasoned french fries and hush-puppies.  The oysters were pretty good, and even better once we dipped them in cocktail sauce mixed with some horseradish.  We also ordered sides of fried mushrooms (which were generic and nothing special), fried calamari (big and tender pieces), and some crab cakes (nothing great - pass on it).  Our friends ordered the raw oysters and they scarfed them down in no time - an indication of how good they were!The service was a bit disappointing, although I don't blame it entirely on the waitress.  It took forever to get our entrees and even after I got my crawfish, two of my friends didn't get theres until AFTER I finished eating mine!  The waitress apologized for the wait, but blamed the kitchen and said they had a bit too many orders.  Apparently, there kitchen staff isn't able to handle a full restaurant.  It's probably a good idea to go when business is slower. Overall, the crawfish was good, but some of the other foods were lacking in any kind of originality or didn't stand out at all in taste.  The service was OK, although the kitchen was slow.   The environment is very laid back and eating at picnic tables lends a certain feeling of fun.

The canh chua is certainly the tastiest I have ever tried and is loaded with flavor, herbs and veggies. They're more than happy to spice any dish to your preference. The rice platters and \\"meal-in-a-bowl\\" options are all filling and a great value. They have a phenomenal selection of lunch specials, all around $6-$7 and run prtty frequent specials of sort of \\"one-off\\" items that aren't regularly featured. The hu tieu do bien and bun cha gio are always a great choice as well, but anyone I've taken there for Vietnamese has found something wonderful, so I imagine you can pick anything and be pleased. Just a tip, a lot of the Vietnamese options are difficult, if not impossible, to cater to vegetarians, though it's pretty easy to swing pescatarian here. That being said, my highly carnivorous husband is always very pleased with this place. They also have all your favorite Americanized Chinese dishes here, including some pretty tasty tofu dishes. But for my money, the hot and sour canh chua rice platter is simply where it is at. The place is in a strip mall, not much to look at on the inside but it is an amazing place to go sit in for a quiet lunch. They offer take-out as well, which seems to be their bread and butter, as I generally see at least a half dozen people come in to pickup when I'm dining in.

I tend to over order because I like to pretend I'm a baller when hungry. So I started off with the popular bulgogi egg rolls which were really flavorful. It's a fusion of Korean fillings dipped in a mild cajun sauce. Yummm. There was this kobe beef appetizer where they bring out a scorching hot rock and you cook the thin slices of kobe on it. Pretty cool since it sears in seconds and comes with a delicious dipping sauce. I ordered a few sushi rolls where the one with thin slice of beef was banging good (I forgot the name but your waiter will know). The chicken noodle soup is comparable to chicken pho so I liked the texture. The best dish I had at Hero was their fish and potato special. I don't think I got the name of the fish but it was cooked to perfection- moist and flakey. The overall presentation of the dish was beautiful.

There's not a single chair with a back on it. It does not make me feel like hanging out. Even more puzzling is the very high quality loose leaf tea. They don't put it in a tea bag. They tell you it will be ready when the tea leaves sink. Um...it's been 10 minutes. There are still floaters and when I tried to drink it I was pulling tea leaves out of my teeth. I make loose leaf tea every day at home. So I know I can rebrew the leaves twice more, thanks. But how to drink it in the first place? Not the way of tea. Finally most of the sandwiches are fried, have cheese and or mayo. Um. Tasty but not so healthy. They do have nutrition information and if you are trying to avoid saturated fat or on a diet you are going to need it. 15 mins. Tea leaves still floating.

The calamari was great. The noodle dish came after our appetizer, nearly 30 minutes later. That was a HUGE gap between our two dishes. Once the noodles arrived, we tasted it and it was disgusting- the dish was literally drenched in so much white pepper and it had no flavor whatsoever, only tasted bland. We come here ALL THE TIME and have ordered these dishes COUNTLESS times before therefore we knew that it was not supposed to taste this way. We waved over the server and told her what was wrong. We told her we didn't want this dish anymore because of how saturated in white pepper and how it was burning our throats, and was with no flavor. The server looked at us looking completely dumbfounded and said, \\"um i don't know what white pepper is but we don't put that in this dish. Have you ever ordered this dish before?\\" Ok, first of all, who works in an asian restaurant and doesnt know what freakin' white pepper is? Second of all, we JUST told you that we've eaten this noodle dish before and it NEVER tasted like this. She continued to ask us stupid questions as if she didn't believe us. She then continued to say, \\"I'm not sure what you're describing but the dish isn't supposed to have white pepper.\\" Are you kidding me? You are going to stand here and tell us that this dish isnt what its supposed to taste like when WE are the ones who are eating the dish right now and you aren't?? Completely ridiculous how she didn't believe us. She then went to go grab the manager and we sat there waiting for 5 minutes with nobody coming to approach us. We saw the server and manager laughing back in the kitchen as if they were mocking us. I felt extremely disrespected by the management and the staff. Once the manager reached us he too acted the same way as if he didn't believe that we had this dish before. The manager then said that the dish contained white pepper indeed and wasnt supposed to be spicy, completely contradicting what the server had said earlier. Eventually he took the dish off our bill but i was completely pissed off about the service here. For having uneducated servers who don't even have knowledge about the dishes served at a restaurant that THEY WORK AT, and rude management. I am never coming back here EVER AGAIN. They need to fire that waitress for completely making herself look like a dumbo.

Eggs scrambled with corn tortillas, scallions, fresh tomatoes, and a chipotle sour cream. The depth of flavor was much more complex than you typically get at a breakfast joint. I normally drench my eggs in hot sauce but this was so flavorful on its own I didn't even want to take away from the flavors!  The other thing that caught me by surprise was the homemade jam. I'm not normally one who loves jelly or jam on toast, I tend to prefer the more savory items, but this was unlike any jam i've had before. It was gooey and spreadable in a way that perfectly coated each bite of toast. I was literally in shock eating it, wondering what on earth they do to make it taste so good.

My wife and I went in specifically to try the sushi.  It wasn't very busy, I guess lunch usually isn't busy at most places.  I noticed a sign on the door that said \\"proper attire required,\\" which apparently means jeans and t-shirt.  I've decided the reason for the sign is to keep people from coming directly after getting a workout at the LA Fitness across the street.  Whatever, doesn't matter.  We were greeted by several hostesses and were seated right away.  We had a server in training, and his trainer sat at the table with us.  A little wierd, but they were very friendly.  They had a decent selection of sushi rolls, not too extensive, though.  Most were the same price (I think it was $12.95) regardless of what was in it.  There was a couple cheaper rolls.  We ordered four rolls and edamame.  All of it was very good.  The wife had a glass of wine, which was also very good.

Ordered a chipotle chicken sandwich with onions, tomatoes, and lettuce. A big chicken salad sandwich and chips on the side for less than $8 but for only $1 more, you can substitue the chips for a choice of their homemade pasta salads or potato salad. The chipotle chicken salad had the perfect amount of flavor and a kick of heat! They make sure to stuff your sandwich with the chicken salad and the toppings gave the sandwich a good crunch. I also picked up a dinner-to-go. They change the menu weekly so be sure to check out their website to see the weekly menu!

Restaurant was relatively busy on a mid Sunday afternoon. Service was efficient and accommodating.Its nice to see the use of cardboard take out containers vs styrofoam. However when I opened my container there was no napkin included with my takeout order. The rolls were cut into 8 pieces, end pieces had lettuce poking out. Portion size was at market value.The use of cilantro and mint created a bold and slightly spicy taste. The balance of flavours between ingredients was well done as was the peanut sauce. Because of the more dominant flavours of the herbs in the roll, the peanut sauce became less apparent.When you cut the rolls into individual pieces it makes for more difficult eating as they fall apart. Plus when you add the extended lettuce to the end pieces it makes dipping into the sauce difficult.Overall enjoyed the effective use of herbs producing a unique spicy essence. Rating however suffered due to the extravagant $12.50 price.Would not recommend\\n2 out of 5 starsIngredients: Marinated Tofu, vermicelli, lettuce, fresh herbs"},{"name":"Se√±or Frog's","address":"8747 International Drive #103","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Service was very very slow.

For all the griping about Voodoo, the quality is not too different. The best of those I tasted was the creme brulee, which is a brulee'd outer donut layer and cream filling (very messy to eat). Also quite good was the peanut butter and jelly donut. The orange flavored donut was fine, but tasted like something you'd get at Starbucks. The Mexican chocolate was very unremarkable.There were also a few misses - the apple fritter donut and the lemon cream filled donut were recommended, but were not so great. But tastes differ, and you can't like them all I suppose. The location in the South Waterfront is perfect, far from the madness of real Portland, and easily accessible. Service was very good, however I don't understand the purpose of a tip jar at a donut shop. Unless you are filling a special order of 600 and gift wrapping each one, I'm not tipping someone for packing a box of donuts.Are these donuts worth dropping $3.95? No way, especially for some of the unremarkable flavors.

I understand that we are in Louisville here, and buffets are meant to please everyone - but couldn't we just have a few spicy dishes?  Or some serve-yourself spicy sauces?My favorite was definitely the momos, with liberally poured orange sauce, followed by the saag and any chicken dish.

Don't get cannoli unless you expect the filling to be opposite of rich, dense and creamy goodness normally seen in those scrumptious rolls. It was flat, unexciting, slightly sweet creamy substance resembling whipped cream. It would go unnoticed paired with anything! I wonder if that is the standard and that's how authentic cannol should taste or if it was an off day in the kitchen. Lobster tails on the other hand were delicious and very unique to me: rich and dense cream filling enclosed by a lobster puff pastry \\"shell\\". It is nice to eat tearing apart with your hands as the texture and hardness of the shell changes from softer to crunchier pieces depending on which part you get. Tip #1: Since the seating inside is scarce and there is no ambiance get your pastry to go and they will let you eat it when you order coffee at a cafe/restaurant couple of doors down. We first tried Cafe Paradiso that's about block away on the other side of the street but they refused us, although they were very slow.

The building is beautiful but the service is horrible and overpriced milkshakes are not worth the wait.   First it was a 2hr + wait so we went to eat elsewhere and figured we would come back for dessert because my friends really wanted to try it.  We came back after eating elsewhere and walking around City Walk a bit to get our table for dessert.  We ordered drinks and 3 milkshakes from our waitress McKenzie and waited and waited and waited.  Each time she walked by our table she smiled and said nothing.  After an hour we got another waitresses attention and asked someone to check on our 3 milkshakes that were ordered almost an hour and half ago.  Still no sign of McKenzie and no asking if we wanted another round of cocktails either.  After 10minutes the manager finally comes over and says \\"I have good news, your milkshakes are almost ready\\".  Really??   So I say how is that good news that they are almost ready.  How is it good for us that 3 milkshakes took 1.5hrs to make - when the manager says because I am taking the charge off the bill and walks away.  No apology nothing.  So finally McKenzie appears on surface again and walks over and says they took the 3 milkshakes off the bill, puts the bill down and scurried away.  No apology or hey, would anyone like another drink or anything before I do the bill.  That's OK McKenzie I walked over to the bar and got us another round well let's say I went to the bar and finally got another round after 15minutes of trying to get the bartenders attention who was drooling and couldn't stop trying to impress a group of young ladies.

The busicuits were very heavy and once drenched in gravy they became as dense as lead and I couldn't even finish them all. The flavor of the gravy was very savory and flavorful and I thought it was great. Others in my group had more eggy dishes and their general concensus was that he food was very good, but maybe not $12 a plate good. I'm knocking it down to 4/5 stars mostly because of being called in as if our table was ready but being left out in another waiting room for 5-10 more minutes, as well as being a touch more expensive than I would expect for basic dishes that I frequently make at home. Yummy food and nice atmosphere though.

We ordered Crispy Sweetbread ($10.95), Cassoulet ($18.95), their special of the day Foei Gras ($23) with a side of Sauteed Mushroom ($6). I was quite disappointed with the dishes actually. While they were tasty, with the exception of the sweetbread, the Cassoulet, the mushroom and the Foei Gras was too greasy. The mushroom was also too sour, we have to combine it with the sweet sauce of the Foei Grass to make it edible. The brioche and bread was nicely done and for the price, the food was really decent but the greasy aftertaste lasted for the whole day for me. The service was also nothing to rave about. While remaining polite, they were quite busy and not that attentive.

We thought that after 3 weeks of low carb that this place would have tasted better.  My wife and I visited Austin and rented a house in the area of this restaurant.  We decided to have Italian food, I searched on yelp and noticed the 4/5 stars with the awesome comments, so we decided to give it a shot.  We went in on a Saturday at 7:45pm and we're the ONLY customers in the restaurant.  The restaurant was unique inside and outside.  Kind of an uneasy feeling with the location off the highway.  We ordered, I had a pizza which was a 4/5 IMO and my wife had stuffed ravioli with WATERED down meat sauce.  They brought out two house salads with massive iceberg chunks that was only half eaten.  I also must have ordered a warm beer that was \\"aged\\" to perfection. The waitress was polite. So no issues there. I'm a little concerned with the amount of people coming in and out that we're not customers and headed to the back kitchen.  Could have been the owners but they went back there a few times from being outside or possibly the bar/dance place next door.

The sea bass from the Mediterranean was cooked well, but bland.

We chose this restaurant because we wanted a place to sit down, out of the noisy airport, with half decent vegetarian food, that wasn't just your typical chain while waiting for a connecting flight. Cafe Intermezzo looked like a local business, which in my experience can mean better quality than chains. They had a bookstand situated just inside the entrance with some intelligent titles including Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals displayed. This gave me the false impression that they might have better food options than the greasy TGIF next door. When we approached the hostess we could see lots of available seating in the back but also a few tables just to the right on this narrow cordoned-off 'patio' area that is basically in the pathway of the airport. We were given to a server who just happened to be waiting there and she briskly sat us next to the entrance on this faux patio without asking if we had any preference. Generally, I would protest but I just gotten off an international flight and was tired. If you look through the photos, it seems like they try to keep this patio area full even when the back of the restaurant is empty to give the illusion that they're a popular place. I really question who in their right mind would want to sit out in this area? It's an international airport, not a peaceful outdoor oasis. To carry a conversation you've got to speak over the noise of hundreds of people passing by to catch trains.Sometimes travelling as a vegetarian can be tricky and Atlanta is one of those airports that makes finding a decent tasting, healthy meal very difficult. When you dine at a place like Cafe intermezzo or any place that isn't exclusively vegan or vegetarian, you have to ask questions. Questions like, 'What kind of stock was used to make today's vegetable soup?' These aren't difficult questions and a quick trip to the kitchen by the server gets us the answer we need to so can be informed before ordering.When I tried to ask this question to our server at Intermezzo, she simply insisted the soup was vegetarian without batting an eye. The menu did not indicate that they make any of their soups in a vegetarian or vegan way, so when I asked again in a different, manner hinting that she should check with the kitchen, she got noticeably agitated and said, \\"What, you don't believe me? I said it's vegetarian.\\" Of course I didn't believe you! She didn't make the soup and the comfort of my bowels is on the line here. I don't know why I still ordered this soup even though I was given a less than trustworthy answer, chalk it up to deliriousness from travel, but it was very unenjoyable as a result.The pasta I had was mediocre at best. The sauce runny and the pasta itself was overcooked and mushy. The drink menu was full of so much puffery it was difficult to decipher what the drinks were. When I asked our server if she knew what some specific german words meant she replied \\"Of course I know what it means!\\"Instead of answering my question, she thought I was attempting to insult at her, awesome! At this point I regret not getting the manager to complain about this insane woman and her terrible attitude. I asked again and she told me it was iced coffee with whipped cream on top. I asked not to have the whipped cream, because dairy makes me ill. Naturally, when she brought the drink it was piled high with whipped cream and I had to shovel it off with a knife (my spoon at been taken).This would have been a 2 star food experience, maybe 2.5 if she had actually taken my requests and brought me what I asked for but instead she basically fought me over everything I opened my mouth to say, even though I was exceptionally polite to her (I'm Canadian for shit's sake!). I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, whether vegan, vegetarian or otherwise. Don't get suckered in by the books or the European cafe vibe. Just accept that the Atlanta airport is hell-on-earth for food and pack a sandwich."},{"name":"El Inka","address":"8560 SE DIVISiON St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Fire roasted chicken as moist, juicy, and well-seasoned Peruvian food at a cheap price.

They're perfect for sharing, which is exactly what I do when I want my coworkers to like me. :PTo top off the excellent food, the service is always above and beyond. For example, I came in right when they opened one day last week, my last five dollars cash in my hand to get an 8 piece for the office. I'm fourth in line (and there was quite a line), patiently waiting and deciding on the ratio. When I get to the counter and place my order, the iPad used to process payment spontaneously starts updating its software. Perfect timing, right? While I'm trying to throw my cash at the poor fellow behind the counter, he's apologizing and writing my order down on a sheet of paper then I'm told I don't have to wait and can pay when the order is up. So I wait amongst the throngs of customers and watch other orders come and go. When my name is called, I explain to the guy who put them up that I haven't paid yet because of the update and was told to pay then. He looks over at the register then back at me, gives a nod, and says, \\"just take 'em.\\" After a beat, trying to decide if I'd heard him correctly, I sheepishly thanked him and did as he said, walking out the door in disbelief. Needless to say, I told everyone at work the story and will be telling it for a while as an example of excellence in product and service. I will always be a champion of this business.

Our server was wonderful, offering any advice we needed but patiently allowing us to peruse the menu. I knew from Yelp that they also made their own mozzarella, so we started there. The cheese was soft and mild in flavor but could still be detected underneath the tasty marinated peppers served with it.My boyfriend tried the lasagna and especially appreciated that the sauce was not too acidic and yet not too sweet either, things he's extremely picky about. I had the lamb ragu and asked the server to choose a red wine for me. It was soft with a hint of buttery finish that was surprising but delicious. The lamb was flavorful without losing its characteristic taste, the lemon - mint ricotta added a bright surprise every few bites, and the fresh pasta.... just wonderful, nothing beats fresh pasta.Creme Brule is my favorite dessert so I forced myself to save some room for it. Thank God I did. It had a soft hint of almond and just enough of a smear of chocolate sauce to rub the raspberries in to make every bite absolutely delectable. Server paired it for me with a pear brandy that accented it perfectly. My boyfriend was concerned that he'd have to throw a glass of water on me by the time I was finished. He also tried the espresso martini and enjoyed it but said it might not be worth $10.Overall great experience, only downfalls would be that I found the table placement rather crowded, people and waitstaff were constantly brushing my shoulders to get by.
