When nobody there even had the shots except for the three of us. we were willing to pay for the three shots that we drank, but they would not let us leave, even though we paid in full our bill for the party of 14. They even had the audacity to call the cops on us, like we did something wrong. It was honestly that waiters fault, why would you add to our bill 80 dollars worth of shots, when only three of us from that table had actually drank it. The waiters also kept saying that the friends who wanted to buy us the drinks, told them to add it to our tab, which was NOT TRUE. Overall, the management and customer service is terrible, and they tried to hold us accountable for a mistake on their end. The friends we met ended up calling in and explaining the situation and they just added the 80 to their card afterwards. The cops even said why would they make us pay for 8 shots when we only had 3.

Main course service went pretty well and everything was good until we got to the dessert round. It was as if we had already left. We ordered coffee and dessert and our dessert arrived without the coffees and from a different server. After everyone was finished Andrew then brought us out coffee, without any cream or sugar. So we sat for another ten minutes or so until we flagged down another waiter to get us the cream and sugar we asked for, for our then lukewarm coffee. Then came time to pay the check. This process took about twenty five minutes. In fact the only reason we were able to pay was because another server noticed that nothing was happening at our table and contacted what appeared to be a manager to get us some help.

I would recommend that they have better ice cream (maybe a good vanilla bean vs plain vanilla) and that they put a smaller portion (I don't ask for smaller portions often, but for the warmth of the crisp - I would prefer it). Or... just put the ice cream on the side.\\n\\nIn any case, it was a good experience, but not great. I would come back for the chowder and to try something else off the menu like one of the pasta dishes with fra diavlo sauce or the lobster roll."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Can I just preface this by saying that I think I'm a little biased against Boston restaurants. It's not you; it's me ... and a little town called Los Angeles. \\n\\nI just spent $29 on a salad and a glass of sparkling wine (coral, brut from the Loire. I don't know the exact name. If anyone can tell me, I would pretty much adore you for at least 3 minutes b/c it was delicious). \\nUhm. $29 DOLLARS. \\n\\nActually I think this is mostly my fault. Why on earth did I order a salad in a restaurant called THE BUTCHER SHOP. I'm an idiot.  \\n\\nMy salad was just ... tiny. There is no other word for it. For $12, I should have gotten a salad that was at least overflowing on my medium-sized to small-sized plate, especially considering the other ingredients (cherries - in season, red onions - pennies, guanciale - fancy word for thick cut bacon, ok not really but pretty much just about). The ingredients were great, very fresh and tasty, but I just couldn't get over the size The vinaigrette a bit salty, but probably from the guanciale. It probably could've used some acid to make the flavors less one-dimensional. OH and a few more cherries because I got like 3 ... total. \\n\\nThe sparkling wine was just delicious. A really good wine, have I mentioned how I would love to find out the exact name? Anyway, $12 for a glass, but I don't feel particularly cheated. I did think however that their list of wines by the glass was rather short. \\n\\nThe thing that bothers me most is actually the service. Languid and unwelcoming is about how I would characterize it. I felt like I got sized up and then dismissed from the moment I walked in. I originally ordered take out and then waited at the bar - restaurant wasn't busy, this wasn't an issue. Pretty much just as my takeout was delivered, the waiter asked me if I'd like some wine. Sure, no problem, but by then I was essentially eating in the restaurant, and I said as much - \\"I'm sorry. I'll just eat here so can you please plate the salad. Sorry for the hassle.\\" \\n\\nMy quibble here is that I wasn't treated like an in-house customer afterwards, and since they essentially convinced me to become one, and I dropped the extra $$, I feel that they should have. So for example, it would've been considerate of them to drop some bread by, but that's just me. And just in general, the waiter's attitude did not make me feel welcome.\\n\\nSidenote: I wonder if the other complaints about service are simply due to the fact that they don't have enough waiters. One semi-waitress and one bartender/waiter doesn't really seem like enough for the amount of tables they have in there. My service wasn't particularly slow, but it wasn't particularly great either.\\n\\nIn summary, I think it's a perfectly adequate wine bar. Don't be stupid like me and order a salad. All the takeout meat products were mouthwatering. Dress wealthier or look older and white to get friendlier service. \\n\\nAND, when all this is said and done. I know a couple of places just off the top of my head in LA that have better service, equally as good if not better food, and better prices for the same kind of food/gimmick. BUT, they're in LA, so yes. Ignore me.  \\n\\nOne last thing, I thought the restaurant's soundtrack was hilarious because it was so much younger (read: hipper) than the restaurant's clientele."},{"name":"China Hut","address":"16721 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"Food is nasty and bland tasting!

Started with the chocolate doughnuts.  Very good. Very. Reminded me of an elephant ear. Next I tried the clam chowder. Sunday? Probably one of the best bowls of clam chowder. I'm guessing a cup of chunky broth on top of 2 biscuits.  Shocked at how much (or not) was in a giant bowl. But the flavor was delicious.  I'm just used to the typical serving of creamy and thick. Next was the biscuit with fried chicken, fried egg, and a thick slice of cheddar. I'd pass. The chicken is paper thin. The breading I tried on its own is very bland. Shocking bland actually. KFC is way better. The egg is well done. Personally I think a little yolk would be good. The biscuit is nothing special and when your done your left with a big crumbled dry mess. Really disappointed especially after people going on about it. My son did the cheesy eggs and steak. The steak was tender and perfectly cooked. The flavor though is horrible. Whatever rub their using I would discontinue.  The cornmeal cake on which the meals sits atop tastes interesting. And in my opinion (and son's) does not pair well with the steak. It's overcooked in the skillet and chewy sweet. Not good. My other son went with the reuben. Best out of the bunch but kraut is very bitter, super smoky, and the pastrami is so thin it looked like fried land O frost pastrami.  Good dressing.

When I dine here late at night I feel like I'm visiting family who will prepare me a delicious and filling meal.   It really tastes authentic and wonderful.  They know what they're doing.  This area is peppered with little taquerias and Mexican groceries.  I think I've been to all of them.  This one has the juiciest tacos out of all of them.  Not only that, but their sopes are outstanding, the tortas are huge and delicious, and the gorditas are real Mexican gorditas in that tasty little crispy shell.  The al pastor is probably the juicest I've had outside of Mexico.  They also have amazing sauces (especially their homemade salsa verde that they put in a squeeze bottle) and Mexican juices that I haven't had in a long time (I love the Jarritos Mandarin soda).  Don't worry about Modelos or Coronas, because their cooler is lined with them.  They also have chilaquiles and a bunch of entrees I haven't tried yet.  The sopes were stacked.  I got it with chicken and it came piled high with cheese, cream sauce, avocados, refried beans, and lettuce.  The restaurant itself is a hole in the wall.  Don't expect much of a cushy atmosphere.

The calamari was yummy, and brought out soon after we ordered it.  They were supposed to bring out some bread, but they didn't, so we ended up asking for it.\\n\\nOnto our main dishes, where the real disappointment occurred.  My husband ordered the Pizzocheri Coi Rapini (Buckwheat Tagliatelle tossed with saut√©ed rapini, roasted radicchio, browned garlic, shiitake mushrooms, and crushed red pepper), which the waiter recommended based off my husband being a vegetarian.  I ordered the Linguine with Pesto and vegetables.  After a while the dishes were brought out, and my husband, who usually likes and eats anything, did not like his food at all.  I tried it, and it was bad....really bad.  It was way over-seasoned and actually tasted like the cook may have dumped the pepper in by mistake.  My husband sent it back and they had no problem with that, and took it off the check.  My food was fine, but that's it...just fine.  Pretty plain Jane if you were to ask me...which the waiter didn't, because he only came back once the entire dinner, to take my husband's food back.\\n\\nWe ended up having to ask for the check, because clearly the waiter had checked out on us after we sent the Pasta back.\\n\\nReally disappointing.

I am a huge fan of small plates, and staggered timing, and sharing dishes as they come out. I really am. But the three of us ordered 3 dishes, clearly as entrees. So when the 2 dishes came out at 3 separate times, it meant that 2 of us were usually waiting.  Thankfully we're good sharers and all enjoyed bites of each others' food, but it would have been a slightly better experience if the two large plates, at the minimum, had come out at the same time.

In addition to their own beer, they've got excellent guest taps and an always-solid local cider selection too. \\n\\nThe indoor and outdoor bars as well as the take-home bottle payment systems are all linked, so once you open a tab you can use it at all the locations.\\n\\nIt's also on the same route as a couple of other distilleries (Revolution and Treaty Oak), a cidery (Argus), and brewery (Last Stand), so you can easily make this a full day trip. \\n\\nThey're pretty active on social media and sport a frequently updated website, so check those to see what's on tap or for special hours around the holidays."},{"name":"First Cup Coffeehouse","address":"4103 SE Woodstock Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I really want to like this place.  Nice set up, nice staff.  It's right around the corner from me.  But the service quality has been repeatedly disappointing.  It's beyond slow (typical Portland, fair enough), as the staff make mindless conversation with customers or friends as half a dozen people wait to order.  The two coffees on tap are at best mediocre.  And my real pet peeve is that they have gotten my simple food order of \\"a bagel with hummus\\" wrong more often than they have gotten it right.  What's the point of offering different spreads if you default to cream cheese and ignore the actual order?  I wouldn't be complaining here about this if it hadn't happened a half dozen times.  Oh, and you serve a town with plenty of lactose intolerant and vegans.  Spend the $10/day to put out some soy milk to go with the cream.

We also asked if he could switch the bar TV, five feet away, to watch a different channel; he stated he didn't have time for that.

So let me first say this - people who come up from New York City to visit me, call ahead and ask that I order at least 2 boxes of Island Hopper's Crab Rangoon - they are that good (or bad given the fried aspect of it).  And on their ride home, the smell on the Fung Wa bus with open boxes of Crab Rangoon is also a hoot.\\n\\nVirtually all the food we have ordered for take out has been very very good.  Of course we are sticklers for selecting the same things over and over again - avoiding those items that just don't do well in the take-out department.

Both my friend and I had been planning to come here for over a year.  We love the South End restaurants and this place had all the makings of being a great place.  But it just fell short... very short, for both of us!\\n\\nThe location is perfect on Tremont Street and the inside is cool and the music sets the mood for a fun night of wine and charcuterie.  We had a reservation at 8 and although our table was not quite ready, they have a waiting area towards the back where you can order wine and wait.  No big deal and the lady helping pick out the wine was very helpful!  Prices of wine range all over the place so make sure you know what you're getting!\\n\\nWhere this place fell short though was in the KEY areas of a restaurant.  The food, price and waiting service! \\n\\nThe charcuterie list was long and looked to have lots of great options.  However, each addition to a plate is $8 (including items like hummus and olives)!  So we went with a sopressata, one of the pattes, and a sheep's cheese from Belgium.  Everything was just OK and came in small portions for the price you pay.  \\n\\nFor dinner, we decided to get the NY Strip and the tagliatelle bolognese.  The Strip being the \\"standard order\\" and the bolognese being a bit of a curve ball, I know.  But in both cases the meals were mediocre.  The Strip was somehow both overly raw and hard to cut at the same time.  The bologense was mediocre and small.  \\n\\nIn terms of service, our waiter was clearly indifferent to our experience and did the bare minimum for us.  I kind of felt like I was in Europe.  I wouldn't mind this too much normally but what bugged me was how long our empty plates sat in front of us before they were attended to.  He also made no effort to explain the menu although we said it was our first time.\\n\\nFinally, what really drags the place down is the price.  When you pay top dollars in the South End you want things to be seamless.  And obviously based on the above they were far from it.  The food & service both didn't end up to our near $200 bill (including a $60 bottle of wine).\\n\\nUnfortunately, we won't be back. I would recommend another South End restaurant like Coppa or Barcelona if you want the same price point."},{"name":"Royal Roast Beef & Seafood","address":"752 Bennington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Chicken kabob salad and add the feta & onions !

He could have pointed to this place as a helpful example:  what is pomo if not the questioning of all identities?  Why can't men dress as women? Why can't a butcher shop also be a bar?  The Butcher Shop is exactly what the name belies, but it's also a clever and unique restaurant Concept.  What that Concept involves--eating blissfully vegetarian entrees in the refrigerator-glow of a meat locker--is not something I'd enjoy every day, but it does give a weird authenticity (read: pomo quality) to its restaurant status, especially since my carnivorous companions thought it was good enough to try to tempt me with a slice of pork.  \\n\\nBased on reports of being frozen along with the sausages inside this restaurant in the winter, which I don't doubt must happen in the small place, I think it must be better in the summer, when the breezy bar and seasonal entrees suit the mood perfectly.  We spoke Spanish to the waiters as we ordered plate after plate of the watermelon salad and sampled some delicious wines.  And despite differing opinions on Yelp about this, all I've heard about their wine list is that it is long, well-curated and actually relatively reasonable, with bottles for $40 that go for $60 at other wine-snob destinations like Umbria.  \\n\\nThat said, please see my review for the Franklin Cafe for what is unquestionably the best restaurant/bar in the BCA (Boston Center for the Arts) strip of the South End."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had a couple issues at Picnic House:\\n\\nFirst off, my husband ordered a Balvenie Doublewood scotch and the waiter did not know what that was, but neglected to speak up and ask or clarify.  Consequently, he received a Balvenie double (shot).  The only way we knew about it was when we got the bill and saw we were charged for a double.  If it was a double, it was a very under-poured double because neither him nor myself noticed it was a double so we could correct the mistake and get the Doublewood that was ordered.\\n\\nSecond, our appetizers arrived and we had no eating utensils.  We had to wait for the waiter to notice we needed something (nor he nor we noticed that we didn't have eating utensils until after he dropped off the appetizers and walked away) and then we had to wait again for him to bring eating utensils.\\n\\nThird, our appetizers plates were cleared (along with our eating utensils) I wanted to hang on to the utensils but I figured the waiter was smart enough to bring new ones.

It was kinda embarrassing.\\n\\nThird, the polenta bread-stuffed portobello mushroom was so over cooked, it was inedible.  \\n\\nFourth, instead of taking the portobello mushroom dish off the bill (I clearly did not eat it), they comped us a dessert.  \\n\\nLast, I wrote them a private note relating our experience (mostly service related problems) and received no response, not even an acknowledgement.

We arrived at 7:50 pm; we placed our order rather quickly, and were seated around 7:54 p.m. We ordered 3 BBQ Chicken Flats (one was apart of a combo), 2 mint drinks, and an extra fountain drink. Almost $50 for pizza. Several situations occurred, which led us to getting a refund. Some of which was totally beyond the staff's control. I'll start with the good things...\\n\\n-The staff , Ms. Brandi, was polite\\n-Ordering was quick\\n-The inside was nicely set up\\n\\nNow the bad\\n\\n-It took almost 35-40 minutes before we got any part of our food order, partly due to the oven going out. The other piece was they were in desperate need of an additional person working.-Also, it was slightly burnt.\\n\\n-They ran out of honey , which isn't a big deal...but she made one of our drinks and completely forgot about the other. She compensated with another drink, as when we reminded her of the second mint drink they ran out of other ingredients as well.\\n\\n\\n- When the second flat came, she mistakenly gave it to another customer. She tried to give me a pineapple and ham flat. Now this was a big deal, because due to religious reasons I don't eat pork at all. At that point 40-45 min. waiting on food, we asked for a refund...\\n\\n-She made us pay for our drinks, after waiting 40-45 min...and not being fed; I didn't want to debate that (Hubby did). I was more concerned about feeding the now fussing 3 yr old , and the increasingly bored 9 yr old. (KIDS ARE CRANKY WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY)\\n\\n\\nI honestly don't think they were prepared for the volume of customers they received tonight.

People are questioning my sanity. Not sweet on Salt and Straw? Nope.\\n\\nMy first S&S experience came at a fundraising event. I was excited to try their unusual, creative flavors. Our choices at the event were Honey Balsamic Strawberry with Cracked Pepper and Brown Ale with Bacon. I went for the strawberry, and my husband, Scooter, tried the brown ale. *Meh* from both of us. The idea of strawberry ice cream with balsamic vinegar and cracked black pepper sounds tremendous --- my scoop tasted like....strawberry ice cream. Scooter said he couldn't really the taste the bacon -- it was more like chewy, tasteless, greasy globs of stuff in a nothing-special brown ale base. \\n\\nI would just like to say that it hurts to be so harsh on ice cream, and on a new, local business that's obviously trying to think outside the scoop.\\n\\nBecause everyone deserves a second chance, and because a visit to the bricks-and-mortar shop would allow us to try more flavors, Scooter and I returned on a Saturday night after dinner. The 15+-person line outside the door reflects the buzz about this place. The counter was staffed well, and we were served very quickly by a smiling, accommodating guy who was happy to help me taste several flavors.\\n\\nThree Berry Barbeque: I totally get the sweet-meets-savory idea, but it was a little strong on the BBQ sauce for me. My taste spoon of Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbon had a huge ribbon of caramel in it... but that seemed to overpower any sea salt taste, if it was there at all. Scooter and I both went for the Chocolate with Gooey Brownies: one scoop in a homemade waffle cone. The brownie chunks were indeed gooey and delicious, the chocolate seemed just a little weak. The waffle cone was perfect -- Scooter says it was the best part of his scoop.\\n\\nOne thing I noticed while waiting in line: the size of the scoops were very inconsistent. If you're plunking down $3.75 for a single, and another $1 for a waffle cone, I think it's fair to expect a scoop that's about the size of a regulation tennis ball, if not a little larger. Some of the scoops I saw were a little bigger than a golf ball. Not cool.\\n\\nI love the promise of S&S's flavors. I may go back to try their lemon basil sorbet -- and I really, really, really want the balsamic strawberry to bowl (or cone) me over. I just feel that they're not following through on a great opportunity. If you're going out on a limb with creative, unusual flavors...get out there until that limb bends and freaks you out a little bit.

We understood the restaurant closes at 10:00 p.m., but at 10:30 there were still several patrons in the bar when a waiter came over to our table and basically gave us the bum's rush, telling us they were closing up.

Absolutely to die for.  One of my favorite ice cream flavors anywhere.  I've had cinnamon ice cream plenty of places and its ok, but this one doesn't just taste like cinnamon.  The ice cream itself actually tastes like a snickerdoodle cookie AND there are bits of snickerdoodles mixed in.  It's heavenly.  Highly, highly recommend if you like snickerdoodles.\\n--Sea salt caramel.  A strong second place, one of my favorite salty caramel ice creams I've had anywhere (and I've had a few).  Smooth, silky salty ice cream with a ribbon of rich caramel sauce.  \\n--Chocolate with gooey brownie.  Despite my love of all things chocolate I don't actually normally love chocolate ice creams, but this was a great one.  The brownie bits were very rich.\\n--Almond brittle with salted ganache.  A lot going on (vanilla ice cream, pieces of almond brittle, pieces of salty chocolate ganache), but it wasn't mixed as well and so there were bites that were just plain vanilla ice cream and bites that were just chocolate ganache.  It was by no means bad, it just didn't wow me as much as the other flavors.\\n\\nI also sampled the olive oil ice cream (it was weird...it tasted exactly like olive oil but with an ice cream texture) and honey lavender (also kind of weird) and my adventurous husband tried pear blue cheese.  Staff was super friendly and helpful, and as I said, samples were very generous.  The prices are on the high side, but the scoops are pretty generous and the tasting flight is not a bad deal if you have someone to share with.\\n\\nThis is the first place that has made me understand the artisan/gourmet ice cream trend.

Although the Insalata di Spinaci still appealed (Fresh spinach salad with apples, strawberries and toasted walnuts in a light blue cheese dressing), I wanted to try something different, so I went with the Insalata Tricolore (Arugula, Belgien endive and radicchio salad topped with crumbled goat cheese, tossed with a balsamic vinegar extra virgin olive oil dressing).\\n\\nMy salad definitely did NOT have any goat cheese and was just lettuce. It was light salad, which is perfect before a heavy entree, but my friend's Spinaci definitely looked tastier!\\n\\nWe couldn't decide between entrees and had it narrowed down to the Orecchiette alla Pugliese (Classic Southern Italian pasta dish with sauteed sausage meat and broccoli rabe, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and white wine) and the Pollo alla Parmigiana (Breaded chicken cutlet topped with mozzarella cheese, baked in a tomato sauce). We asked the waiter for his advice and he said 1) they are very different choices and 2) they are his 2 favorites!\\n\\nIn the end, we decided to try the Orecchiette, as I'd tried the chicken parm before and my friend ALWAYS gets chicken parm.\\n\\nWhen the bowl arrived, I did not think there was enough for us to share, but it was deceptively filling!

Eventually she did find it in her purse while Roman paced in front of us, wanting to go search in the lanes saying things like \\"You don't want to cooperate with me, I can't cooperate with you!\\"...and so on, until she found the ticket.\\n\\nI'm compelled to write about this because there are so many things that are hard to get right in the service industry but this is not one of them. \\n\\nTreat your customers well. We were being very reasonable and his behavior was aggressive and agitated, you would think it would be the other way around? \\n\\nMy best guess is he was somehow trying to impress his staff that were there or he just had a bad experience with a customer who was really giving him a hard time, because we were definitely not. We were actually pretty shocked and speechless by the whole display.\\n\\nAny manager who values customers would have simply said: \\"I hate to be the one to enforce this policy because I know it is really cold out and hate to see you leave without a coat but we've actually had problems in the past where...\\" Doesn't take much to explain and empathize while trying to figure out other possible solutions.

The ribs were completely falling off the bone which I know some people like but to me are a sign of improper cooking technique. There should be a little pull to them and the meat shouldn't be so soft that the only sensible option is to eat them with a knife and fork. More importantly they were just over glazed. The ribs tasted like a really sweet glaze with a lot of salt and nothing else. The cornbread was fine. The mac and cheese was also fine but pedestrian. It wan't super creamy or flavorful it was just run of the mill mac and cheese dusted with bread crumbs.\\n\\nMy wife had the bourbon chicken which was also salty and sweet.

Even restauranteurs in the North End would come here and the North End has how many Italian restaurants to choose from? Now I've been to Italy and had real deal Italian food, so if I had a nonna, I think she'd approve of Rino's. I truly found the food extremely delicious and authentic. All the food is cooked to order, the portions are insanely huge so expect to doggie bag lots of leftovers.\\n\\nMy biggest and only compliant which I had to dock a star for; the wait is miserable and they don't take reservations. My friend told me we needed to get there before it opens and she wasn't kidding. We got there on a Saturday at 330 pm and had to wait up to 2 hours to get a table. On the weekend they open at 3 pm, so can you imagine? However, if you come to Rino's you'll see because the food is \\"that\\" good, people would wait as long as needed in the cold or even in the heat for it. The food speaks for itself and tells you a lot about this hole in the wall. I agree and think Rino's is hands down the best Italian in town and nothing compares.

It's definitely a microbrewery.\\n\\nBut one look at the labels on the beer, and you'll get your first inclination that not all is as it seems.  Someone really cared about the art.

They are truly brewing the beer they want to drink, even if it's Commercial Suicide (that's actually the name of one of their beers).  That makes it sound like the beer isn't that great, but trust me, it really is. \\n\\nMy $10 got me parking, a tour, more than enough beer (these beers are strong!) to keep me from driving later, and a very cool souvenir glass. \\n\\nI also highly recommend trying their sour beers.  They're brewed differently and quite unlike anything you've had before.  When I went, they had the Sour Black Metal, which is a stout, but it had a distinctly different taste and a mouthfeel more like wine than dark beer.

I needed something quick and easy. Mexican food is often a good choice for us because most restaurants have a lot of gluten-free options without trying too hard - chips, salsa, guacamole, corn tortillas, tacos, etc... I tossed the kiddos into seats, ordered a margarita, some fresh guacamole, and looked over the menu. \\n\\nThe kids devoured the chips and salsa while I looked for some suitable menu items. My drink came... It was merely ok. I asked the waitress if she knew what items on the menu were gluten-free. Wait for it... \\n\\n\\"Nothing.\\" Whaaa? What do you mean, exactly, by nothing? Well... she went on to say that they are months away from getting a gluten-free menu and, for now, not even the rice is gluten free. \\n\\nOkey dokey. So I pressed on - what about the tacos? Are they made with corn tortillas? Bingo. My girls could eat crunchy tacos with chicken, cheese, and lettuce. Onward. I ordered tacos with a side of fruit for the kids, my husband ordered farmhouse enchiladas, and we enjoyed our guacamole while our dinner was prepared. The guacamole, for the record, was also ho-hum. My kids loved that they put queso fresco on top but I really thought it was under seasoned in spite of the fact that I had them put \\"everything\\" in when they were making it tableside. \\n\\nThe final nail in the coffin for this Mexican meal adventure came when they brought our dinners... I'd ordered sides of fruit for the little people and they brought out small plates with 3 large slices of orange. And, according to the kids, the oranges were really sour. Augh! Basically a disaster. Thank goodness for the chips and salsa at the beginning or we would have been in serious trouble. We won't be coming back."},{"name":"Olive Branch","address":"115 W 3rd Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"I've never been tempted to write a bad review but my lunch experience keep getting worse. I sent an email via the restaurants website and have yet to receive a reply. \\n\\nCute space, lovely greeting by the hostess and tasty food, however, the service was subpar especially after I read the previous (stellar) reviews. \\n\\nThe ordering process took a bit too long considering only 3 or 4 tables were seated and tons of staff members wondering about. While we waited for our order, I noticed a hand written sign outside describing the specials. I wish we knew about the specials before ordering.

We never received water refills, I had to request a refill from the gentleman who brought our lunch entrees.\\n\\nWe also had to request our checks which then lead to a huge mess and an extremely long wait when the staff either mis-keyed or didn't know how to split the check. Both my friend and I now have two pending bank transactions, only one correct, and are hoping the other falls off after being voided. I did notice the manager step in to assist our waitress with the check (and make a call to figure out how to fix the issue). It's odd that no one, at any time, thanked us for our patience or apologized for the error and delay. Come to think about it, no one thanked us at all for dining there.

I've eaten here twice so that's a good sign that it's not horrible and that it didn't kill me. These two visits allowed me to sample a couple items before really making a decision. After both of those meals I've decided that I'd give this cart about a 2.5 star rating (if only Yelp would let me), so instead I've opted to err on the side of generosity and award a 3 star. It's pretty standard fair as far as the meals go and the service is relatively fast. So now the breakdown:\\n\\nSpicy Chicken: It was mildly spicy but tender and well cooked. Served with the staple plain white sticky rice. To sum it up, a well sized portion of decent tasting and somewhat spicy chicken to fill you up. It did just that too so it fits the bill for a quick and predictable meal.\\n\\nCombo Bulkoki-Chicken: This is a combination meal (yep the name is that obvious) of teriyaki chicken and bulkoki served over white rice. Really the bulkoki wasn't that impressive and while it was plentiful it was fairly tasteless and bland. The teriyaki chicken was run of the mill so really can't say much here either. Not a bad lunch at all but really not something that had me clamoring for seconds either. \\n\\nMeals come with a little side salad (iceberg lettuce) that is covered with some kind of creamy dressing - it's ok but again, nothing spectacular. The noodles I wasn't into and they always send along a side of kimchi, which I give to the guy who sits next to me @work and he seems to enjoy the hell out of it. \\n\\nAll that said, the big question is \\"would I eat here again?\\" and the answer is \\"sure\\". Not a great big enthusiastic 'yes' but a medicore 'sure' as in, if it's really busy @ the carts and I need something fast and filling, then I'll probably drop in again for something in lieu of waiting longer for something better.

While their homemade sauce was good, I found myself wishing for more flavor and more food.\\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the Eastern North Carolina vinegar sauce. This kind of sauce can be hard to find, so I was eager to try it. Tangy and simple, it had a little chili spice to it, as well. The sauce was the best part of this sandwich, and I wished that there was more of it. The sesame seed bun was perfectly ordinary, kind of like a fast food joint's. Maybe a nicer bun is in order, or maybe some bread instead? I can think of several carts that have their buns in good order, so this wouldn't be difficult feat. The meat was plentiful and tender. It absorbed the sauce fairly well, though it could've used more of it. I found myself desiring more than a little bit of smoke in the flavor, as well. With either more smoke or more tang to the pork, I'd gladly give this cart another star. Likewise, if the sandwich had been bigger, I might've been a little more generous. It doesn't have to be a feast, but for $7, I don't want to leave hungry. \\n\\nWhile the sandwich came with cole slaw on it, I elected to have it on the side, instead.

When presented with a menu, it's like my mind instantly goes blank. I want one of everything! As soon as I decide on something, something else catches my eye. What if that thing is better? What if I regret my decision? What if I order incorrectly and everyone hates me? Worse, what if I hate my food, and therefore myself? WHAT IF MY LUNCH ORDER BRINGS ABOUT THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE?!\\n\\nSuch heady decisions are obviously hard on little old me. So The Picnic House's approach to lunch decisioning - letting me choose a little from Column A, B, and/or C (a smidge of sammich, a smidge of soup, AND a smidge of salad?! YES PLEASE) is the ultimate in responsibility absolution. When I dine here, I can rest assured in the knowledge that if the zombie apocalypse begins, it won't have been because I made the wrong lunch choice.\\n\\nOn my last visit, I chose the wild mushroom soup, an uber-tasty portobello sammy, and a crazy-yummy butter lettuce salad. Naturally, since it was lunchtime (WHAT? Sometimes my workday ends at lunch, OK?) I also ordered a Rose City cocktail, which was diviiine. 'Twas a little like an aviation without the creme de violette, and such a perfect light, summery accompaniment to my fall-themed lunch.\\n\\nThe service was GREAT, AND they take reservations, so I'm really pleased with this place. I don't have time to sit around waiting for a table at lunch time (or anytime, really, but especially not lunchtime), so reservations are key.

We ordered the boeuf bourguignon and it was so tender against the crispy bacon and gnocchi.

Good service and very clean inside. I've been on the hunt for a decent Mexican restaurant in Orlando for a long time now, once you eat Mexican in Texas its a wrap...you're officially a Mexican food SNOB. Unfortunately, this place doesn't compare to the flavors I've tasted in Texas but for Orlando, it's one of the best spots. \\n\\nThe portions are HUGE and the prices are so reasonable. If you are a vegetarian you will be very pleased with the number of options that cater to you. A breakdown of our order: \\n\\n-Shrimp Fajitas: So good! Shrimp was perfectly cooked and flavorful. \\n-Bean Burrito/Potato Enchilada/Mushroom&Cheese Quesadilla Combo: HUGE portion and so cheap, honestly you can split this with 2 people. \\n-Chile Relleno/Mushroom Quesadilla: Also a huge portion that is served with rice so you're officially in a food coma afterwards. \\n\\nThe only negative was that the Chile Relleno was just average, we were not blown away by its flavor so probably would not order that again.

When we show it, they say it can't be used on weekends. After pointing out that this isn't specified here, and that others I have purchased do specify it, they say they'll honor it.\\n\\nSecond, the wait we were told was 20 - 30 minutes. Because this is a small place located in a more residential area. She took our cell number for the wait list so that we could sit in the car since it was chilly that night. Twenty minutes pass, then thirty, forty...you get the picture. After like forty-five minutes, we were told just five more. Fifteen minutes later we were seated.\\n\\nSo at this point we're starving, and slightly annoyed. But she's been super nice the whole time we were waiting, so we're giving it the benefit of the doubt. The food I'm seeing on other people's plates looks amazing. This is also the type of place with a ton of regulars, which is usually a really good sign.\\n\\nWe look at the menu and I decide on eggplant parm (for me the true test of good Italian) and the bf goes for sausage with broccoli rabe and garlic. The pasta is fresh made and there's like seven kinds to choose from. The wine starts at five dollars a glass, and they don't skimp on filling it. Lift from the table with care or else it may spill. Yeah, like that full.\\n\\nWe learn from the owner that the restaurant has been there for twenty-two years, and that she and her husband took it over from his parents about twelve years ago. He does all the cooking, and she tells us he's an excellent chef and that we'll love the food.\\n\\nThe meals arrive and she wasn't lying. This is the best eggplant parm I've ever had. And the portion was probably the equivalent of four meals, but yet I ate half of it there and the other half the next day. \\n\\nThe waitress comes to get our food and boxes it up to go. She asks me if I want a little extra sauce put on top so that it will heat up better. Seriously? Such a simple gesture, but one that totally made me happy (and definitely made my leftovers better the next day).\\n\\nThe owner was standing behind me at one point, and I turned to her and let her know that the food was worth the wait. It's the type of place that I can't wait to go back to because I want to try more, yet at the same time the eggplant was so good that I have a hard time straying from it. Solution?

There was only a few but I could savor each sweet bite. I wish there were more for the price.  $7 for 8 peppers were pretty high for small grape sized peppers that I can stuff all in my mouth but then again I don't know the market value of peppadew peppers.\\n\\nCharbroiled Wings\\nThe honey ginger sauce was kind of hard to dip so I spooned it on each wing. I was worried that the ginger would be too strong and overpower the chicken but it didn't. The wings have a clean and fresh taste to it. It was great. \\n\\nPistachio and salted caramel gelato\\nMy problem with pistachio gelato is that I can't find it at most grocery stores. I pretty much always order pistachio gelato when I judge a gelato place. This is one of the best pistachio gelatos I've ever had; better than Paolos pistachio. It had the consistency I expected and pistachios in each bite. The caramel geltao was smooth and creamy. It wasn't super sweet which is what I prefer. Most salted cameral geltao I taste are way too sweet and not enough salt. \\n\\nI also like that their Parmesan cheese didn't taste like wood pulp. \\n\\nDECOR\\nModern and sleek.

How HARD is this people!?!  Do you not sample your own menu??  I really wanted the garlic one but he recommended the tomato basil.  Okay fine.  So I got the whole wheat penne with tomato basil.  The hubby got whole wheat penne with the garlic tomato sauce, chicken chunks and a salad.  That sounded good so I got a salad too.  I asked what dressings they had and she fumbled all over that one too.  I asked for French, like she said and he asked for Italian.  She asked me THREE TIMES what kind of dressing I wanted and every time I replied French.  I asked if the fresh mozzarella could be cut in half into 2 oz because I was trying to watch it that day and didn't need 400 calories worth of cheese.  She asked Daniel-san if he could do that...insert glazed over look again and conferencing.  \\n\\nAt this point, we were about to leave if very simple requests were being blown WAY out of proportion.

I was ready to hurl my garlic bread at them from above but I refrained.  The meal was decent.  Not anything out of this world, I make better.  The garlic tomato sauce by the way does NOT have chunks of tomato either so I could've gotten that.  Thanks.  The chicken was marinated and tasted really good but the hubby said there wasn't enough of it.  The butter is really good and probably the only reason I'm giving them a marginal 3 stars.  Honestly, we probably won't go back at least not if those two are working it."},{"name":"The Park Pub","address":"1755 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Goodbye Checkers, hello The Park.\\n\\nDo I like the new name?  Not so much.  But it's what inside that counts.  However, I appreciate the title of \\"Park Ranger\\" on the manager's name tag.  Cute.\\n\\nThe new open seating plan is a refreshing change.  It creates an atmosphere better suited to mingling and large groups.  There are still cozy booths along the walls, but the old inner seating with the booths made for an awkward space that felt like parts of the pub weren't connected.  The atmosphere is dark and trendy, but I like it.  It's very different from the old look, so I see the regulars being somewhat upset about this.  It has a very modern look now, and gone are the tacky booths and vinyl.  The low seating and tables near the front windows have taken advantage of the natural light and work much better than the old seating here.  So if you don't like the darker back corners, check out this nice area by the windows.  \\n\\nThe beer menu is quite impressive.  I'm liking this trend toward craft brews that is finally happening in Vancouver.  Most of the options are local/BC beers, which is great.  A few good Phillips options (raaaallg Chocolate Porter), Driftwood (swoon), Howe Sound, Russell (hello, Black Death!), Central City, etc.  You have the option of a sleeve or proper pint, too.  You're going to be paying premium prices for craft brews in a 20 oz. glass, though.  Be warned.\\n\\nFood.  I like food.  These guys have some.  Some is good, some is so-so.  \\n\\nThe good - Sliders.  Get 'em.  I don't eat a lot of beef, so when I do, it's because it's good.  These are good.  Nice and tender patties cooked right (medium rare, oh yeah) with a delightful horseradish mayo (I hate mayo, so this was done well), banana peppers and cheese.  Nice combo of flavours.  The bun could be of higher quality, but overall, these were the standout dish.  Also good - Spinach and artichoke dip.  Did not disappoint.  Nice and creamy thick with good cheesy stringage action (yeah, you know what I'm talking about).  \\n\\nThe decent - Bruschetta.  This was okay.  Didn't have a lot of wow factor.  But was tasty enough.  I ate it without really thinking about it, so it was good, but not something I would go out of my way to order or remember.\\n\\nThe so-so - Calf's liver.  If you don't like liver, don't order this.  Liver fans may enjoy it.  I'm on the fence with liver. I thought it was nice and tender, but the liver flavour is very strong with this appy.  Tread lightly.\\nThe mac and cheese.  Bland.  Sadly bland.  Needs a sharper cheese to jazz it up.  The little bacon bits were nice, but there needed to be more flavour overall.  Fresh basil, perhaps?\\n\\nI didn't try the seafood options.  The salmon wasn't wild.  The prawns were from Mexico.  It's Spot Prawn season.  Get on the bus!\\n\\nThe menu overall needs some design work as my friends and I found it hard to read.  The options were... typical.  If this place wants to stand out they need to offer something more exciting.  They have the interior going for them.  Nice staff, as well.  And some great beers.  Now they need the food to step up.  Perhaps they should try beer and food pairing options.  Like some dishes specifically created to pair with particular beers, if they really want to highlight their craft brew selection.  I think this would go over well.\\n\\nSo, in the end, I will be back for drinks.  Perhaps some snacks, like the dip and the sliders.  I like the new look, and the staff are as lovely as always.\\n\\nPS - look for the photo on the wall of the 6-way love hexagon.  Try deciphering who is doing who.  Hint - they are on a boat.

Without hesitation, the lady blurted, \\"Turner's down the road.  Best.\\"\\n\\nI took her advice.  In a tour I took later that evening, we were told this location doubles as Bridget Bishop's (the first \\"witch\\" to suffer death at the trials) old tavern.  Unconfirmed, but I also just got home and haven't researched.  \\n\\nThe building feels like home.  Not any home that I have ever owned, nor been in, yet it happily embraced us trendily dressed (a la Goodwill fashion) patrons without an upturned nose.  I will admit that business formal seemed to be the dress of desire, but alas I cannot comply with my meager wages.  \\n\\nThe ambiance of the decor was as classy and warm as the service.  Our server was generally knowledgeable, courteous, and thorough.  However, when we decided to eat here, the crowd was thin.  Dare I say we (respectfully) took a lot more of her time than she could have afforded in busier circumstances, but she obliged without any sort of hesitation.\\n\\nThe specials are plentiful.  We came at about 4:30 on a Thursday, and incidentally fell into their 4-4-$6 special (any four appetizer items for six dollars).  This special is currently going on, but for how long I cannot say.  I'd highly recommend taking advantage of it.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we selected their crab cakes and oysters Rockefella, and clam chowder.  For lunch, we chose Sesame Encrusted Ahi Tuna, Hake Marsala, Newfoundland Finnan Haddie, and Lobster Macaroni.  Below, a brief commentary regarding each.\\n\\nCrab Cakes: Delicately fried, ice cream scoop-shaped golden balls occupied their plate in perfect placement as though geometrically decided.  Delicate to the tongue, rich to the stomach, but a bit too intense with the spices.  Dill stood out in particular, especially to those of us who entertained their tartar sauce.  If you order this, do not use lemon or tartar.  Even without the condiments, the delicate presentation promising a delectable crab flavor lost out to the spices that were used almost as a cover-up for some deficiency.  Delicious, but not a star.  \\n\\nClam Chowder:  Very reasonably priced for what I came expecting (based off of my experience eating chowder on the Wharf in San Francisco).  Taste was similar.  To be blunt, the clam chowder here was like a perfected version of something you got canned.  Cream dominates the flavor, and the potato texture went to grit, choking the velvety finish of the soup otherwise.  Perfectly cooked, but not as impressive as I'd hoped.  The star of this dish is the exceptional texture to the clams, which violated every law of physics one would expect when eating a cooked clam.  Worth getting, but certainly not as impressive as other offerings.\\n\\nOysters Rockefella:  Delicious.  Worth every penny and bite.  Rich.  Only mad I couldn't order a hundred more.  The only downfall I had was with a bread stuffing-like texture I hit on the second oyster.  I also felt that--while absolutely delicious--the Parmesan might have been too intense.  The sharp cheese tended to own most every aspect of the flavor spectrum here.\\n\\nSesame Encrusted Ahi Tuna:  Expensive, but perfectly paired with the wasabi aioli.  It tasted fresh.  It looked fresh.  Texture was divine.  The external cooking process and saucing did not overcrowd the glory of the Ahi taste.  But Ahi gets a bit boring after several bites.  The only downside I had was the \\"Cool Asian Noodle Salad (peanuts)\\" which tasted nothing more than of peanut butter.  Not that the noodles were bad, but the peanut (butter?) flavor was so intense that it neither complemented the tuna nor enhanced the experience (for lack of being consumed) except in visual presentation spilling out of an overturned cliche Chinese to-go box.\\n\\nHake Marsala:  The winner of this trip is the Marsala.  It felt like Turner's had procured every single mushroom from harvest this year, leached out the delicious flavor, and infused it into a fish canvas.  I felt many questions gurgle up to my mind as I tried to imagine how they could ever get that much mushroom flavor into the dish.  So delicate to encourage overeating, yet so rich and flavorful to encourage savoring to the point of leaving leftovers.  Of the dinners ordered, this is the dish I'd recommend you get if you come as a tourist.\\n\\nNewfoundland Finnan Haddie:  Perfectly cooked, fresh-tasting haddock (caught locally we were told), dressed in an onion au gratin sauce.  On its own, or paired with unrelated appetizers, you'll not be let down.  Pair it with oysters Rockefella, and you'll feel like you're watching a play in two acts, only the second act is pretty much the same as the first, with a different cast.\\n\\nLobster Macaroni-  It's lobster and macaroni with a heavy familiarity to the oysters Rockefella.  Good, but only order if it's the only thing you can fathom on the menu.\\n\\nOverall: 4 stars.  Would visit again."},{"name":"Atasca","address":"50 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only been here once, but our dinner was excellent.\\n\\nWe had wonderful food in a fabulous setting.

I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday morning a little after 11AM and there was already a little bit of a wait. It only gets busier later, but we were so lucky to be seated about 5 minutes later. The trick is to be willing to share a table with another party or two. Winsor has about 6-8 big tables and only a few smaller tables. \\n\\nTo start off, I was really happy to see an extensive menu (twice the size of Great Taste, which I local), AND there are also pictures for almost every item menu. It's super helpful even for someone who knows Chinese and knows the English translations for dim sum fairly well. We ordered the steamed shrimp rice noodles, rice noodles with dried shrimp and cilantro, shrimp and chive dumplings, pork and peanut dumplings, and steamed pork ribs over rice noodle rolls. The food is AMAZING. It's steamed fresh to order and the tricky thing with so many rice flour-based items is that it can easily be too doughy. However, this was not the case here at all for all of the items ordered. Literally the dim sum was so rich in flavor without being overpowering. The only dim sum item I did not immediately love, but only found standard, is the steamed pork ribs over rice noodle rolls. It's still delicious, but the pork was too fatty and nothing special. \\n\\nOn a side note, I was so excited to see that Winsor offers the mini egg tarts that come in a set of 3.

We also had the fish and shrimp Moqueca which  was chockfull of seafood and was served in broth that had lots of tomatoes and cilantro. Yum!\\n\\nI got the silk stocking cocktail which I didn't like very much. But the capirinha was awesome.

Me and my friends were very impressed and we had gone in with high expectations having heard so many good things about it. We split the wild mushroom raviolis and the muscles and little necks for an appetizer. Solid. The raviolis were amazing and cook perfectly. The broth that the muscles and clams sat in was amazing. Dipping the bread into it really got things off to a great start. I had the chicken parm and the homemade raviolis to go with it. Wow. It was great, probably the best I've ever had. The portions were also great, especially given the price. It came with two huge raviolis and a massive piece of chicken cooked perfectly. One of my friends got the Calamari and pasta which was equally amazing. The Calamari was cooked very well. My other friend had the veal parm and that was on the same level as the chicken parm, which is to say amazing.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small as noted by almost everyone. You come in and leave your name and number which is nice. That way you can go sit in your car or head up to the small square near by to look around or have a drink.

Another reviewer said that he was standing outside and that several groups would come and sit right down. That was the same case for me, and the hostess told another couple that these people had done what I said. They came, put their names in and then mulled about elsewhere and returned once their table was ready.\\n\\nThe service was fine and everyone was friendly.

Too bad, since it was a better review.  A little more than a year later, my overall opinion after several more visits has somewhat soured on the place, mainly due to poor service.  I'd say the chance of getting a friendly waitperson is at least 50-50, which is too bad.  Maybe the very regular customers get a better reception--hard to tell.  My family and I have gone there at least 4 or 5 times over the past year, once on my birthday, and the food quality and value is consistently good.  No beefs there.  But I'm a little tired of the brusque, rushed, semi-exasperated reactions from the waitstaff, no matter whether it's when you walk in, having your order taken, or asking about a discrepancy on a bill.  Service is part of the deal, and Bacci's falls short too often.  In a very recent visit, my father asked if the caesar salad and garden salads were the same price--the waitress said yes, and he and my husband ordered the caesars.  They turned out to be twice the price.   When discovering that on the bill and asking if it could be adjusted our waitperson's answer was an exasperated \\"I'LL TRY!\\".   Hey, if it's their error, it shouldn't be a big deal.  It was corrected, but we were treated as though we had asked for a free meal or something.  Give me a break.\\nThe restaurant should also do something about the door from the backroom into the restroom/back exit hallway.  People are constantly coming and going, and it slams loudly every time and lets in a lot of cold air.   \\nCan't say we'll be back again soon.

We indulged in the pear and blue cheese the other night that was simply fantastic. My boyfriend had the brown ale and bacon and I really loved the chunks of bacon. $3.75 for a cone isn't cheap, but for the quality ingredients and flavor profiles, I don't mind paying it.

Our experience was both good and meh.  We arrived and were seated at a nice two person table in a back room.  So far so good.  We had come to Trulucks with the intention of eating crab because it is a favorite food for both of us.  We both ordered from the \\"Date Night\\" menu and got a plate full of Johah crab claws (with mashed potatoes and asparagus), a cesar salad, and a shared dessert.  \\n\\nThe cesar salad was AMAZING.  The crab, however, was simply okay.  The claws came pre-cracked for us, but it was difficult to get the meat away from the claw and I bit down on hard crab claw pieces more than a few times.  The mashed potatoes that came with our meal were delicious, and the asparagus were ok (I don't like thick asparagus very much, which these were).  \\n\\nA few problems:  We were never offered any bread with our meal while the tables around us were.  It made me sad because I really like fancy bread.  We were never offered hand towels after eating our crab.  This wouldn't be a problem, but the waiter told us he would bring them and they were desperately needed towards the end of the meal.  I also started to feel very nauseated after our meal.  It wasn't a great way to feel after a nice meal.\\n\\nBonus points for: Letting us take our dessert to go since I wasn't feeling well, giving us two slices of cake instead of one, and providing us with a little truffle box as well.  The staff was very friendly, and the service was good.  \\n\\nI also like a restaurant that will go out of its way to make the customers happy.  While we were waiting for a table, a middle-aged couple arrived, dressed to the nines, and obviously ready for a night out on the town (or at least a nice dinner).  They approached the hostess desk only to be told that the reservation they thought they had wasn't actually there.

After our meal, we were waiting behind another couple.  Ok, we are going to be serviced next.  The guy goes to get the car of the people who were in front of us and about 5 or 6 more groups come after.  Mind you, we were all standing in line.  When the valet guy comes back, he just grabs all of our tickets and heads to the garage.

No approval tasting, no pouring done whatsoever.  That's a first! \\n\\n- Cambodian style doesn't mean bringing out dishes 1 by 1 and expecting a family style meal to take place when portions are clearly individual and it's just not possible to share a single order of 4 fresh springs among 7 people - it just doesn't work.\\n\\n- My soon to be sister in law is Cambodian - so please don't disrespect her by telling her that this is traditional Cambodian style of service.  Just be honest - tell us that service is slower than optimal as you are still adjusting to having a larger restaurant with new wait staff.\\n\\n\\nFULL REVIEW: \\n\\nWhen our party of 7 arrived at 7pm on a Saturday evening, the restaurant was about half-full.  We were given 2 or 3 menus to start with as the restaurant was running short on menus.  That wasn't a problem as within a few minutes time, more menus freed up.  We placed our drinks order & food order and chatted away while enjoying the ambiance of the restaurant (which is quite clean, nicely lit and overall comfortable).\\n\\nThis is when things started to go downhill.  Drinks started arriving one-by-one spaced out quite unevenly and we had to remind our waitress that some of us were still missing drinks.  My brother's fianc√©e and I ordered a bottle of Kenwood Merlot to share - the bottle was placed on the table, already uncorked, accompanied by two wine glasses.  Our wine was not opened in front of us, we were not poured a taste nor were we even poured our wine.  It was just all put down in front of us.  First time that's ever happened to me in a restaurant.  Never mind the fact that the wine was not very good - it seemed watered down in taste, very light-bodied.  Not what I'm used to in a Merlot.\\n\\nNext, 1 of our 2 appetizers of Fresh Spring Rolls arrived.  A single order has 4 pieces, mind you we are a party of 7 so we were expecting the second order to come out simultaneously (or at least within close proximity).  After waiting for 5-10 minutes, we questioned our waitress on the status of our second plate of rolls and were told that this restaurant provides Cambodian Family Style service - so plates are meant to be shared and food is brought out one at a time as it is ready.  Seriously?  We are supposed to share 4 rolls between 7 of us then get another 4 rolls to share again?  How does this logic make any sense?\\n\\nEven the soups we ordered for appetizers came out at a staggered pace.  My friend finished his before mine was even brought to the table.  That said, the Shrimp Tom Yum soup and Chicken Lemon Soup were both quite tasty and well executed.\\n\\nFinally, our entr√©es - there was a good 30 minutes time difference between the arrival of our first and last entr√©e.  We also had to remind our waitress for the rice bowls that were supposed to accompany our dishes.  Given the size of the plates and the individual portions of rice doled out, I do not consider these really family style and my brother's fianc√©e, who is Cambodian, agreed.  Again, the food itself was delicious - we ordered Loc Lac, Cha Ugg (which resembled a plate of Alpo dog food but tasted much better than it looked thankfully), Cha Krung (tasty) and Chicken Fried Rice (for those less adventurous in our party).\\n\\nAlthough we wanted dessert, 2.5 hours had lapsed since we were first seated and the thought of waiting another hour for our dessert did not sit well with us.  I will commend the staff for allowing myself, my brother and his fianc√©e the opportunity to visit the kitchen and speak to the Chef.  As my soon to be sister-in-law mentioned to the Chef, the food is good and we understand that things are busy, but the suboptimal service is what we found inexcusable.\\n\\nI'd like to give Floating Rock another shot... after my trauma has subsided and after they've worked out their kinks."},{"name":"Haley House Bakery Caf√©","address":"12 Dade St","city":"Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the vegetarian slop for breakfast (grits, scrambled eggs, collards, caramelized onions in a bowl).

I was craving Mexican and the food smelled delicious. Unfortunately the poor service overshadowed the food completely. When we arrived we were given the menus and then forgotten. We watched two other parties come after us and get served their chips and water while we waited for about ten minutes. When our server did come she took our drink orders and still did not bring us chips or water. She never checked to see if our drinks were okay or to see if we needed anything. We had someone else come and they were sweet enough to bring us water and a refill on our drinks. When our food came our server continued to not check up on us (someone else brought us our food) and we had to wait for someone else to come fix it because we had asked for pico on the side because I have an onion allergy. The whole time I felt like we were just a huge nuisance to our waitress especially watching everyone else get served.

After looking at it I could tell that at least this location would be awful for brunch as the tables are small, the menu limited and the fact that it is more of a coffee shop vibe. I decided to get breakfast here anyway and they were out of the ingredients for two basic egg on bread items on the menu but could make something else with an egg baked into a roll with creme fraiche. I thought this dish was awful but at least it was a freshly baked roll and some poached eggs. Add a little jam and we got ourselves a breakfast once I scrape all the other crap off. Well they don't serve jam, but you are welcome to buy a pot of it... \\n\\nI also had a coffee which was about on par with Starbucks and got to perch at a tiny table jammed next to some other people who kept knocking their chair into me for what cost almost $20.

It left us thinking with a bit more effort it would be something. For our main course we had the tagliatelle Bolognese and tortellini stuffed with cheese with pesto and chicken. For the tagliatelle the sauce was underwhelming and also very runny. The pasta was ok but I think based on the thickness it was more fettechini sized. The cheese tortellini was so plain. There was no much taste to the pasta. The chicken was very plain and just placed in a light pesto that it tasted like plain chicken. Wasn't happy. \\n\\nOur dessert we had the chocolate cake and creme brulee. The cake looked great but was low on taste. The creme brulee didn't have the correct consistency.

We ordered a chocolate potato donut, a bacon date, breakfast board, and shashukla with merguez sausage. Service was consistent, friendly, helpful and quick. All of the staff pitched in with refilling water, coffee, presenting dishes, etc. We only had one major and notable gripe about the service.\\n\\nThe food was all tasty. The items we ordered were more than enough for two. I wish I would have realized before I came here that everything here is unlike anything I have experienced as a meal for breakfast and should anticipate this. It took me a minute to leaf through the brief menu selection and land on something interesting, but still familiar.\\n\\nThe breakfast board had a duck mousse, medium-boiled egg, yogurt cheese, pickled beets, bread, crostini, bacon, and jerky. Everything was tasty, but I had a hard time pairing any of the items and I tried many combinations. This may not be the intention, but it would have been nice if it could have been. I probably would not order the breakfast board again in the future and opt for another dish.\\n\\nThe shahukla was very delicious and piping hot. Remember that if you order it: piping hot. The entire bowl is served straight out of the oven and our waiter failed to give a head's up. This caused touching the bowl and a burn. The dish itself was very delicious. A medley of bell peppers in a tomato sauce, with spices, and sausage, topped of with an egg. I loved the flavor and sopping up the dish with the toasted bread. The staff apologized profusely for the burn and offered our meal gratis. We were appreciative, but again, wished that a head's up were provided. \\n\\nAnd my take on the donut and the date? which I ordered not knowing are \\"things\\" within the Yelposphere? Donut is love. Whatever love is, that donut is it in its purest form. It's crunchy on the outside, soft and chocolaty on the inside, and the white sweet sauce is wonderful. \\n\\nThe bacon wrapped date was tasty also. I think it's reached the status where the hype leads one to believe it'll be the food-version of solving world hunger and implementing world peace. It's just a date wrapped in bacon!!! Very simply dish. Take it for what it is! I think it was very good. Add a pinch of the sea salt for an additional salty kick.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is industrial and well designed. There is a front bar area for adults only, offering seating by the bar. Progressing to the back, there is an exposed kitchen, with bar seats around, and tables behind.\\n\\nCoffee is bottomless here, though I only got to cup 2 before I was done. Oh, and we loved the way salt and pepper is dispensed on the tables here. They are provided in tiny trays with a spoon.

Being that it was also right next to the airport, it was obviously busy. We had a party of 8 people and waited about 45 minutes for our table. At this point we were still relatively happy with the experience.\\n\\nAfter we were seated we waited almost 20 minutes to get drinks and have our order taken. In between getting seated and ordering our drinks, they sat a huge part of people next to us. It was around 30 people. They did not have enough room to seat them and about 6 people from their party were seated in chairs very close to our table and told by our waitress that we were \\"almost done\\" and that our table would be theirs very soon. I hate feeling rushed in a restaurant and that's how we felt. We waited over an hour for our food and it of course was delivered Luke warm. \\n\\nAfter getting most of the way through our meal, our waitress made her way over to inform us that they normally charge an 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more but because she did not inform us of this, she would \\"let it slide this time\\". I was very put off by this. A gratuity is for going above and beyond the call of duty in a job and she wasn't even close.\\n\\nA few minutes later she gave us our checks. She hovered like a hawk around our table to see what everyone was doing. She grabbed the cash right out of my girlfriend's hand before she was even done deciding what this woman's tip would be. I was also shocked to see what she did to a friend of mine at the table. At the time we received our checks, him and I were having a conversation. He signed the bottom of the check and had not yet finished writing the tip and final total. This waitress picked up his receipt, looked at in with a sense of disgust and entitlement and proceeded to look at my friend and say \\"oh, you obviously aren't done here\\" as to imply that he hadn't tipped her yet.\\n\\nTo top it off, this waitress had the balls to stand there next to our table and talk to her manager about how she was having such a bad night because we weren't going to \\"tip out\\". you NEVER insult your customers on the floor of your business...especially when they're right in front of you. \\n\\nI don't know anyone who would leave a tip after the kind of service we got that night.\\n\\nIf you've taken the time to read all this...i'm sorry it was so long.

There are some other foods to order but I then to stick with the basics. \\n\\nThings to remember - this place sometimes runs out of food. It happens. Get over it. Plenty of times I have swung in only to be told they sold out of the lamb or beef or even the chicken. Sucks, but it is what it is. His hours are 10-2:30. So if you roll in at 1:40 you may be shit outta luck. Or call and place your order! \\n\\nThere isn't really much seating - benches under cover or 2 picnic tables out front no cover over these. Parking can suck - it's NW duh.\\n\\nHe takes cash and credit cards now. It's really a 2 man show, the owner runs the BBQ and the register, his helper cooks, preps and fills the 100s of trays with rice. It's a great system and quick going.

Well unfortunately my home doesn't have young hipsters who interrupt you while your placing an order, or who takes the last sip of your cocktail, or who takes your only provided napkin, and almost the last few bites of my food. As a 29 year old I felt like my grandma having to almost slap the lady's hand away from my food. My partner and I came in a Friday around 9pm, and it was busy, but not overwhelming. This place is a 'Order at the bar\\" establishment, which is fine, if you are allowed to order at the bar. The bartender dressed as sailor moon took our order for two house margaritas, then went back to her conversation with two gentlemen at the bar. She placed the drinks down and then we had to ask her to order food, she then interrupted our order to ask if we wanted to keep our tab open and proceeded to go to the POS. We then told her we would like to add to our order, and she almost seemed annoyed to have to communicate with the kitchen staff about it. Our food was very good and came out quickly! A little more than half way through our meal my partner went up to order us another drink. While he was doing that another bartender came by to (what I thought) was to take an empty drink. She did, as well as our napkins, the last bit of my margarita, and almost our food, all while not speaking a word. I literally had to grab my napkin back from her fist. A simple, \\"are you folks all done here\\", would have avoided all of that.

There were maybe two other parties when I came in, but then I realized they had a downstairs room where other people came up from after finishing their meal.  I was quickly and politely shown a table for one.  The waiter gave me the daily specials, and the burrata (arugula, fresh mozzarella, figs, prosciutto, and balsamic) was huge and delicious.  After going back-and-forth through the menu, I finally decided on the black fettuccine with fresh and smoke salmon.  I opted for a glass of a red blend...yeah I usually pair a seafood dish with a white, but was really craving a red which actually went really well with the entr√©e.  The salmon was plentiful and delicious, but since I polished off the huge appetizer in the burrata...I could only eat about 1/3 of the pasta and didn't have any space for dessert (well almost no space).

For entrees, we shared the Fish with Mussels Muqueca and the Deep Fried Red Snapper. While presentation was great, I was a little let down by the muqueca, which tasted a bit under-seasoned to me. Maybe it was a fluke? Sigh, isn't this what people come here for? \\n\\nOh, high expectations -- darn you.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the red snapper was pretty good! Hey, I LOVE fried fish (especially when it's whole with bones and all), so maybe I'm a little biased. The plantains that came with the dish were awesome. Normally not a fan, but this time around I couldn't stop eating them; had to refrain from ordering an extra side! Wasn't too keen on sharing them either... (Sorry friend!)\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Muqueca was alright... I probably won't be back, but if you're curious about Brazilian cuisines, you should consider checking out Muqueca.

We finally ordered a round of mimosas which came out in a decent amount of time- but it took awhile for our waters and for us to even order.  \\n\\nThe menu is very seafood inspired- lots of shellfish dishes and sushi.  Unfortunately, I cannot eat shellfish, so I was very limited with what I could order.  Luckily, they had my \\"go-to\\" favorite- Eggs Benedict.

I love beer, and they make some interesting stuff. But for me, it was more about the experience of it as a party scene created around a highly specialized craft brewed product.

The brewery is located in an old metal farm building - very cool-and they even have a giant outdoor pizza oven (Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza). For truly, what is beer without pizza? \\n\\nThe atmosphere was fair or park-like - wide open space, lots of picnic tables everywhere, but spread out enough not to feel like it was crowded (though we figured there were a thousand people there throughout the day.) They've got a tasting room that had lines out the door all day, but if you don't mind being limited to just a few beers, they had another tent on the property with 5 small kegs of some of their most popular brews, and local (but not Jester King) brews were available at Stanley's. \\n\\nThere was a 3 piece band playing at the brewery and great music pumping out of speakers at Stanley's. This made for a very festive and fun atmosphere. They had their processes down to an art form to handle so many folks, such as, they text you when your pizza is ready. In the pizza area were lots of outdoor games like bean bag toss (no inside places anywhere on the the property except for a giant metal roof over some tables and a stage).

In fact, it is hard to find just dessert and tea or coffee around here.  I'm not quite sure what it is about the actual barbecued meat that is so forgettable. And to be fair, there is pretty awesome competition around these parts, even if you have to drive for it. It is ok, just not the kind of barbecue flavor you dream about.

I am the type of person that once I set my eyes on something on the menu I have to try it. No substitutes, have it just like the chef makes it. Now I knew prior to ordering that the duck is a game meat and cooking it to perfection is KEY. The waiter (Anthony) asked how I wanted it prepared and I replied exactly how the Chef would prefer.

They even have vegan cheese. The juices are freshly prepared in front of your eyes. Chicken and pasta salads are also available from time to time while supplies last. I recommend the wraps over the sandwiches because for a dollar more (about $5 and change), you get a lot more bang for your buck (compared to about $4 for sandwich). The sizes of the wraps are also run bigger and the attendant behind the counter will add ingredients as you wish and bill you accordingly. Well, at least he should. Read on...\\n\\n Apparently the guy in front of me ordering his food at the counter had gone too far- adding too many vegetables in heaping quantities and extra hummus when he perfectly knew that his wrap would be charged just the same if it had half the ingredients in it. So the attendant bounced back and told him enough is enough. I somehow got caught in the fiasco when the client started throwing a fit aloud that the attendant was out of line. It's rare to be caught in a verbal m√™l√©e, so in an attempt to diffuse the situation I politely reminded the client that it is, after all, only a sandwich. \\n\\nThe client didn't heed to any of my advice and started complaining to everyone and anyone who wanted to hear him. He even stopped Jordan, the assistant manager (who coincidently is the owner's son) and started complaining over his $5 grievance. I managed to pry myself out of the dramatic cross-fire and find a spot outside to sit and eat.\\n\\nAnd here's where it got real sweet- the client followed me out and apologized for bringing me into the situation. Moreover, the manager even came over a little bit later and offered me coupons towards my next purchase! He said that he didn't want that that situation ruin 'my experience at Hoover's'- something that I thought was a shining example of what lengths the proprietors here go to ensure customer satisfaction.\\n\\nIN A NUTSHELL: Crawl behind any whiny, dramatic, and vociferous client that may cause a scene so you may score a discount. Just kidding. Check this place out though for a healthy snack- the Sunflower Market has very modest selections so don't keep your hopes up for an extravagant meal. Be prepared to wait a little while (especially if the person in front of you has an elaborate saga of an order that comes straight out of telenovela) since things are mostly made-to-order. Smile and thank Dr. Hoover that he raised a good son like Jordan who is ensuring that the business is in good hands at least for another generation."},{"name":"Little Trouble","address":"1170 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went on a Friday night with some friends just to check it out.

Enough space indoors to seat a good number of people, and the patio outside provides some more quality seating. Took a seat in said bar stool. Okay, this is where it gets interesting... 4 staff members behind the bar, for a good 5-10 minutes we were 'ignored' .... Ummmmm HELLO! A couple who walked in behind us, took a seat across the restaurant, came over to the bar, and a bartender took their order literally over our shoulders.. I slightly giggled at this and shook my head in a bit of disbelief, and in that moment ALICIA (Alisha) not sure the spelling... With her figurative cape on rescued us from a tragically terrible experience. With grace and all smiles she swiftly came to our aid and quenched our thirst. The cocktails were great, the drink menu, unique. Love the fact they had fresh mint on the bar for Mojitos, they have some pretty interesting flavor profiles for old time favorites (margaritas, punch mix, etc) the over head music was pleasing, I would say it was a good mix of 60's 70's hits.. The place is brand new, probably opened a bit early, not entirely stocked and trouble shooting some other areas. Without Alicia (Alisha) the star rating would have been a 2, with her a 4.

Rino's was recently highlighted on the Food Network and while I am happy to see the restaurant get much deserved attention, it means long lines and waits.  There is not a waiting area inside the restaurant, so you will need to wait in your car - or your apartment for us locals. They will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready.

Now let me tell you about this Almond brittle with chocolate ganache, it had salty and sweet as well as crunch. It was oober-delicious and my fellow friends and I ended up choosing the same flavor! Apparently this is a popular flavor and if you really like it, you can get it in a pint for home ($8/pint)\\n\\nSECOND VISIT\\nA week later, I was in the neighborhood and wanted to bring a friend to show my new discovery. Only to find out that they had opened at 12. I looked at my phone and it was only 11:15.

I've always had a great meal there and I would highly recommend the small Italian restaurant.\\n\\nIt's located in a small, classic craftsman house in the heart of midtown Atlanta. The interior is cozy and warmly decorated - the front dining room adorned with dozens of classic Italian drawings. It doesn't get loud because there are only about 15 or 20 tables at the most. Each one offers an intimate setting.\\n\\nThe staff is almost always accommodating and the servers are personable and excel at service. On our last visit, we were taken care of by Hannah and she was honestly one of the nicest and most professional servers I've ever met.\\n\\nMy only complaint in regard to the staff is that there is sometimes confusion on table availability and location. It's not good to tell me there are no other tables available when I can see 6 open ones. Nevertheless, it's a minor bone to pick.\\n\\nThe food is exceptional and highly consistent. I fall prey to ordering the same thing almost every time because in my estimation, the tortelli di mele is as close to a perfect dish as one can get. It's all made from scratch from the ravioli pockets to sausage inside. The medley of flavors is indescribably good. Try it and you'll see what I'm talking about.\\n\\nThe bruschetta is also very good. The plate comes with 3 different kinds - tomato, olive, and a mixed piece. It's a very underrated appetizer - though obviously better when tomatoes are in season.\\n\\nFor a seasonal dish, their pumpkin ravioli is hard to beat. It's got an earthy flavor and is actually made with real pumpkin unlike so many fall items which are only flavored with allspice.\\n\\nThe wine selection is decent, though not extensive. What they do have is carefully chosen and matches the food very well.\\n\\nThis is one of those tough judgement calls because this feels more like a 4.5 star place than just 4 stars, but it's not quite a 5 star experience either. From ambiance to service to the exceptional food, it's never a disappointing experience."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"4400 Ashford-Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3005","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Not bad, considering it's a chain restaurant.

I apologize for not writing a more cliffnotes version.\\n\\nThis past Friday (4/22/11) four of us showed up without a reservation. We stood there for a couple minutes as they decide whether we could be seated. We're told to wait 15 mins. We go to the bar and wait only 5 minutes. Not bad. We grab our drinks and are seated at one of the many open tables seen throughout the dining room.\\n\\nOur waitress does not come for the next 20 minutes. Finally she shows up and tells us that the reason she didn't come by was because we had drinks on the table already. Had she done her job, she'd realize that we brought these from the bar.  This place was busy, but not packed. We have no idea what was keeping her from our table, I'm gonna blame one of my friends for smelling bad because she was essentially non-existent as a waitress. \\n\\nWe order our food (waitress did not know the menu) and some waters. The waters never come. 15 minutes go by and no waters, no waitress. She was spotted at times but didn't seem so keen on checking on her tables I guess. We flagged down another waiter to grab us waters and he was all too willing to take over our table. He gets us some waters and we wait probably a good 10-15 minutes before we see our waitress. She has the spring rolls we ordered, the only app we got and it was very middle of the road (not terrible, but not very good). She didn't know the menu, but she did know that an appetizer comes before the food because she told us that. Wonderful.\\n\\nSo we got our appetizer 25-30min after ordering and wait another 15 minutes before the waitress comes back to tell us that even though it's been 45mins since ordering, the kitchen has not started cooking our food. The place was, at max, 3/4 full. 45mins and they haven't started cooking our food. No thanks. We ask for the manager and without her even entering the kitchen she tells us that the kitchen has started cooking our food. No thanks, we get our app comped and left, went to a neighboring chinese restaurant, walked in and had waters, beers and our food all within 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe waited a long time for this place and was really disappointed. I think we'd be willing to retry it only if they got their s*** together, especially since it's a little bit expensive for the food you're getting. If you look at all the comments from 4/22, 4/23/11 you'll see that they got some work to do.

Pass on the soggy potato chips. \\n\\nOur waiter, a bespectacled, be-goateed man in his late 30s, was splendid. He confidently led us through the short but unusual menu.

Normally my honey has a photographic memory but for some reason was drawing a blank - so we ended up with kafta spice (great with meats) and kabseh spice (good in rice).  Tonight we went together to have a meal, and get some groceries, so I asked about the zataar.  They have three types in various sizes and they wanted to know how I was going to use it.  My answer:  \\"I don't know\\".  Well they proceeded to tell me how to mix it with olive oil to eat with bread.  Then they proceeded to slather some on a pita with veggies and then grilled it up for my honey and I to try.  So considerate and helpful.  And it made a great appetizer.\\nYay!  Zataar!!!\\n\\nWe ordered the ribeye dinner.  They butcher the meat right in front of you, slicing a lovely cut right off the larger piece from the butcher case.  It was a beautiful looking steak.  Served with rice, potatoes, and a greek salad.  I absolutely adore their potatoes and everything was juicy, tasty, and amazing.  I will probably be dreaming about that meal tonight.  \\n\\nFor dessert they served us a piece of baklava.  Best EVER.  My partner theorized that the key was in the honey used.  He said he had to find out what kind it was.  We complemented them on the excellence of the product he said it's his specialty - a secret.  I asked him what kind of honey he used and right away I could tell from his response that I'd hit on the secret to his magic.  I got  no reply from him other than 'he makes his own syrup\\".  So it remains a mystery.... but isn't that what magic is all about?  The air of mystery?\\n\\nSo the zataar infused sandwich, the meal, the dessert, the groceries (juices from Egypt, spice, pita and roasted nuts) and we left there with satisfied stomaches and happy minds  The owner insisted I give him my phone number so he can call me next time they make their roasted veggie salad - having discovered that we share a love of roasted eggplant.

I was expecting a disaster but pickup and payment was quickly done at the front desk and I was on my way. The mac and cheese was really good but I'm used to multiple cheeses from most places. The creamy cheese sauce was good but one-dimensional. The ribs were some of the best I've had. It was only a little bit smokey/charred, which is what I prefer. The meat was fall-off-the-bone, tender, and well-seasoned. Not too salty, and went well with the slightly sweet BBQ sauce.

Each time I was thwarted as the place seemed to keep the oddest hours.\\n\\nHad they been abducted by little green men? Did men in black spirit them away because they'd seen too much? Or maybe they WERE the extraterrestrials and finding the nature of mankind to be too-destructive, had decided we were no longer entitled to their delicious food?\\n\\nNope. The place was just in a transition to new ownership, with a different \\"pizza-only\\" menu, and I think they were just working the kinks out. Though, I guess any of the above conspiracy theories COULD be true...maybe the aliens are taking pity on us and serving up fantastic pizza as a sort of last meal before the utter annihilation of our species...\\n\\nWhatever the case may be, the fact remains that the pared down menu at UFO, while offering somewhat fewer choices than many competing pizza parlors,  still covers all the traditional sizes and toppings. This is not where you go for designer, haute pizza...this is where you go to get a quality, well cooked pie, with delicious simple ingredients, at a very good price.\\n\\nPizza comes in 12-/16-/18-inch pies, or by the slice, and has neat astrological names (Moon = cheese, Mars = Pepperoni, Zodiac = Pineapple and Ham, Galaxy = any 4 toppings). As I said, the available toppings (12 in all) are pared down to the core basics with just a few non-standard choices (feta, jalapenos, garlic) - and gyros and pasta are a thing of the past, but they do still offer salads.\\n\\nI called in an order for a large Mars ($15) and it was ready super fast! Their pies are thin, crisp, with the right balance and distribution of toppings, and (most importantly) totally grubbin! While I'll destroy pretty much any pizza put in front of me, my problem with most thin crusts is that they usually end up either (a) too floppy and bendy or (b) cracker crunchy.\\n\\nUFO Pizza's pie master is too skilled to let that happen - their pies are crisp enough that you can eat even a huge 9-inch slice one handed,  no knife/fork, plate, or pizza-origami skillz required! Nary a drop of grease speaks to the quality cheese and pep, and there were even visible ribbons of tasty, white mozzarella in the cheese blend. The sauce is zesty, and doesn't overflow or muck things up - though was ample enough to really add flavor. \\n\\nIf this is a \\"true NY-Style\\" pizza, then it's no wonder why New Yorkers are such defensive snobs about their pies! While the place is a bit small, the menu is a little limited, and they don't deliver, I'm definitely down with UFO and will be back frequently. Bonus points: they have a couple TVs and will gladly play whatever game you're interested in. Double Bonus points: they have a couple VERY reasonably priced beers, including the Midwest legend Old Style in a can!\\n\\nThe truth is out there...and it is that UFO Pizza is pretty out of this world [*groan*]\\n\\nOh, and in case it IS run by aliens ready to destroy the world...KLAATU BARADA NIKTO!\\n\\n[*Bob Lazar claims to have been a physicist at a \\"secret military installation\\" near Area 51 called \\"Sector-Four\\", at which he alleges the government investigated extraterrestrial flying saucers, commonly called UFOs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar)]"},{"name":"Buckhead Bottle Bar & Bistro","address":"268 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Super pretentious and douchy staff.

I wanted to eat at Poompui. But, i got distracted by a mexican food cart a little further down.i did not review that experience. and it was meh nothing to make me want to rush back for. Then 2 or 3 other times i'd been at Carts @ PSU at those times Poompui was always closed. Found out yesterday they close @ 6pm. Ok! I got their around 1.45pm and their were about 6 people waiting for food and another 2 in the queue to place orders. So its obvious this cart is popular with the local workers, puplis, and visitors. Frist thing that catches your eye is they have an extensive menu selection or at least it seems like that when you take your frist look at the menu board. After the lady in front of me placed her order, as i approached the till; i still wasent sure what i was going to order. That is unusual for me especially with Thai food. It may have been the fact that their were so many items to choose from or possibly i just didnt know what i was in the mood to eat. I believe it was a combination of the two. So as to not make the 2 ladies behind me wait to long i glanced to my right and scanned the menu board. I ordered the frist thing that i thought i might like; which was Pad eggplant(aubergine). I quickly got my food. And proceeded back to the vehicle. \\nNow i opened the cardboard box and at first glance i was dissapointed. As their werent hardly any vegetables. I had ordered no meat add temph, heat level hot. Now what was in the box was over cooked eggplant(aubergine) (but still tastey) onions and temph. And a whole bunch of white rice. The flavour of the sauce was fine. Although it was overly sweet. Not at all hot the way i had requested. I may have made a mistake ordering pad eggplant(aubergine) as their were absolutley no veggies.surprisingly the sauce didnt over power and saturate the rice. So you could still actually enjoy the rice.The temphe was a nice offering. Most chinese and thai restaurants only offer tofu. So thank you Poompui!  I'd say my first experience at Poompui was under whelming. Im definetly going to return. To try out several more things on the menu.

Che Cafe was doing breakfast that day, so they were open. Still, I inquired on whether the chef could prepare something off the lunch menu, and he had no problem doing so. Earned some brownie points right there, in my opinion. I went straight to the lunch menu and ordered their Sadie Black Bean Burger ($8): a homemade black bean burger topped with aioli served on a grilled onion bun. You get a choice of any or all toppings, including lettuce, tomato, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions (or fried onion strips), and choice of cheese. I asked for all the toppings, going with pepperjack cheese.\\n\\nThe burger came with a generous portion of fries (regular or cajun) and choice of sauce. I chose their cajun fries and went with their regular Mohawk sauce, an aioli of sriracha, ketchup, and mayonnaise.\\n\\nThe burger was delicious. The delicate black bean patty held its own among the sea of flavors here. Ryan knows how to cook, that's for sure. The onions were perfectly caramelized, the mushrooms wonderfully sauteed. Both beautifully coated the inside of the grilled onion bun. Many places opt for a sesame seed bun or a regular run of some sort. Not here. The onion bun assured each bite had awesome flavor, further pleasing the palate.\\n\\nThe fries were also very good, and the sweet/garlicky/spicy nature of the Mohawk fry sauce is a hit with me. The sauce is extremely mild for me, as a note, but maybe others will feel it more. I would have liked the fries in the fryer maybe a minute longer to crisp up more and get more golden brown. Just my personal preference, anyway. A great meal here in North Portland. Che Cafe is another place I definitely recommend!"},{"name":"Zippity Do Dog","address":"160 Speen St","city":"Framingham","stars":"4","text":"Excellent little hot dog stand right off of Rt 30 on speen street on the framingham/wayland line right near the business park.

I've also sampled the ribs, corn, and several tacos- all super tasty.\\n\\nEven though you order at the counter, I've always had great service from the Pig Floyd's staff.

Then I remember leaving after dinner being thrilled that we were moving to Cambridge soon, which would make coming back over and over again much easier. \\n\\nThis place is fantastic for dinner. Everything we've had during our multiple returns-- shrimp and grits, potato gnocchi, north african dip plate, roasted beet salad, cuban reuben, pulled pork sandwich, warm banana bread pudding, etc etc-- has been delicious. The drinks are also great. \\n\\nOnly downside is... it tends to be packed after 7, and if you go earlier in an attempt to beat the rush, it tends to be full of families with kids...who tend to be loud and irritating. So maybe that's two downsides. But I still love it enough to keep coming back and to tell everyone I know that it's well worth the effort of getting out there.\\n\\nHowever, brunch, which we've only done once, is a different story... There is live music, which is a nice touch, and good coffee which is a must. For cocktails, he had a Man's Ruin and I had a Fiona, both of which were tasty and strong. We ordered the beignets to start which were good but would have been better with some of that bourbon maple syrup... Then the fried green tomatoes which were excellent. We also had the dirty bird because it sounded like the wonderful treats at Pine State Biscuit in Portland, OR, but it wasn't quite up to par... Either a) more gravy or b) a runny yoke would have helped make it less dry. \\n\\nSo overall I would say... yes for drinks, yes for dinner, but brunch could use some improvement."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very disappointing experience today.

I know that it gets raving reviews from almost everyone, but my experience here was definitely a letdown.\\n\\nI came here on an afternoon during off-peak hours, so I was able to grab a seat pretty easily at the bar for appetizers and drinks, which is all my friend and I really wanted.  We walked in, were seated at the bar, and waited patiently for someone to acknowledge us...and waited...and waited.  After realizing that no bartender or server was going to give us a menu, I got up and went to the hostess to ask if I could see a menu.  She scowled at me, rolled her eyes, and said, \\"They have them at the bar!\\" and begrudgingly gave me a menu from a large stack.  I didn't realize I was inconveniencing her or depleting the abundance of menus!\\n\\nWe ordered a few beers after grabbing the bartender's attention (they have decent selection of beers on tap), and looked over the menu.  We ended up deciding on the 'Redneck Nachos,' which I asked for without the pulled pork because I'm a vegetarian.  While we were waiting for our order, we watched one of the bartenders attempt to make one of their cocktails, which required egg whites...and watched him accidentally drop the yolk into the shaker.  I get it, mistakes happen.  Get a new shaker and start over.  Nope.  He attempted for several minutes to fish the yolk out of the shaker, inevitably breaking the yolk and scooping out what he could.  \\n\\nAfter that appetizing experience, our food came.  The 'nachos' were a pile of pork rinds with a side of grits topped with black beans and corn salsa.  Let me repeat...PORK RINDS.  When I ordered the nachos, do you think one might ask if I ate PORK rinds?  I guess not.  Fail.  The bartender was apologetic, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).   \\n\\nLike I said, people rave about this place, so maybe I should give it another go, but I don't know if I can bring myself back to such rude staff and a poorly ran establishment.

Sure, the communal seating across two tables and the completely open kitchen may be a turn off to some, but I absolutely loved being able to see all of the dishes being made before me and enjoying them at the same time alongside my fellow diners - it was like a dinner party hosted in your best friend's kitchen (if said friend happens to be a James Beard award-winning, critically acclaimed TV star chef). When you look up between bites of perfectly seasoned, tender rack of lamb to catch a glimpse of cheese being carefully sliced off the wheel for your next course, the entire experience becomes deeply intimate, special, and personal, and the careful precision that goes into not only crafting each dish but also the single menu for the week becomes extra evident. \\n\\nAs for the food: there's not much to say, aside from that every dish was expertly executed and absolutely delicious. Dinner consists of soup + crostini, charcuterie plate consisting of 6 bites and 4 palette cleansers, meat entree, salad, cracker and cheese plate + accoutrements, and a dessert. I was terrified of the charcuterie and cheese plates as I'm generally opposed to the notion of eating pure saturated fat and lard, but the appropriately-sized portions felt light and not like artery-clogging, cholesterol disasters - some, including the totally unique foie gras bon bon and the champagne-poached apricot, offered the single best bite of food I've ever had, exhibiting fascinating blends of textures, temperatures, and flavors. Fresh, local, seasonal produce was featured prominently and to great effect throughout, with standouts being a little dollop of lightly dressed, carefully smashed English peas scattered atop a ricotta crostini, and a lusciously velvety puree of mushroom, garlic, and hazelnuts that could stand on its own, even if it weren't serving as an accoutrement to a perfectly roasted-to-medium-rare double rack of lamb. The lowlight of the dinner would have to be the dessert - a rather pedestrian vanilla custard topped with an excessive amount of whipped cream - but the goat milk caramel and supremely flavorful orange roasted rhubarb went a long way to elevate what I appreciated to be a light and not-too-sweet dish.\\n\\nMy advice - go here now before it becomes impossible to get a reservation following the inevitable endowment of a Michelin star(s).

In addition to pizza (available by slice or whole pie - medium/large), there are salads, calzones, subs, pasta, and a smattering of Italian apps available. \\n\\nTo start, we ordered the bruschetta, which for only $4, I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size - the perfect amount for two people. We also enjoyed them, the baguettes were crisp without being hard, and the tomatoes and mozzarella were fresh For our entree we went with a medium pie: The Chicken Alfredo ($15; grilled chicken, alfredo sauce, basil). Overall, we both enjoyed it - it is predominantly alfredo sauce, so if that's not a flavor you enjoy, don't order this one, but if you do it's quite good! It's rich and savory, the chicken is well-cooked - not dried out all, but unfortunately there was absolutely no hint of basil which I'll admit is disappointing. The crust also was much to tough - not crispy, hard,  and parts of it were burned and singed.  Thankfully, it was only the crust that was burned, so the integrity of the pizza remained in tact.\\n\\nThe service was good, the staff was friendly and attentive enough, and we received our appetizer, pizza, and bill in a timely and efficient manner.

We ordered a wide variety of dim sum to share between 4 people and the bill came about to about $12 per person and we were all stuffed and happy.  Beware, they do put tea on your table and will charge you an extra $2 for it. The tea is good though and unlimited refills so it's not half bad.

Now, moving back to Boston.  We are at a loss of where to go.  Everywhere seems a bit run down and grimy.  So we returned to our old hangout - Winsor Dim Sum Cafe.  \\n\\nThis time, with a baby in the stroller, it was tough getting up the stairs through narrow double doors that keep out the cold winds.  The lady at the counter was extremely sweet.  She asked if we minded sharing a table (of course we don't, as long as we get to eat!) and helped us take the folded stroller back behind the counter.  We were seated quickly (Saturday morning about 11:15am.  I know!!  How lucky!!)  \\n\\nEating with a baby is like playing \\"Perfection\\" - one has to be fast, precise, efficient.

J likes \\"northern style\\" dimsum which includes long sticks of fried dough and sweet soybean milk; whereas I go for the classics:  shrimp dumplings, shuimai (pork), sharkfin (not really sharkfin, just ruffled edged dumplings with hints of cilantro), tripe (yes, cow stomach that has textures similar to rubber bands), congee and a rice dish.  \\n\\nExcept for the shrimp dumplings which tasted a bit \\"shrimpy\\", the pork was delicious.  Of course, J loved the fried dough and the soybean milk.  The dumplings were excellent.  Congee was pipping hot, just the way it's supposed to be.  We were surprised the rice dish was some fried sweet rice topped with thin layer of fried egg.  \\n\\nThe total bill came to $27 dollars or so.  We hardly touched the rice dish and had to get some dumplings to go.  We finished rest of the dishes later that afternoon.  It was a great meal.\\n\\nHINT:  To see whether if the Chinese food is fresh or not, wait until it's cold.  If your Chinese food smell in your car on your way home, perhaps you should think twice before eating it.

We first tried a week ago on Friday and was told when we arrived at 8 pm that there would be a 1 hour wait.  So we returned yesterday with reservations.  We waited a little more than we would have liked to be greeted by our waitress and start asking questions about the menu.  In fact, after waiting about 5 minutes, she walked by, said \\"I will be right with you\\" and then took another 3-5 minutes to come back.  Here is what we ended up ordering:  two mixed drinks, $10 each.  They were ok.  I had the Swift Kick in the Tito and he had a Step in the Right Direction.  For me, $10 for a drink is pricey and I expect to have an interesting concoction.  Nothing terribly remarkable here.  Go to Holeman and Finch or No. 246 for some serious mixed drinks.  Next were the raw oysters, $2 each from Virginia.  They didn't feel completely fresh and seemed pre-shucked a while ago.  That nice briny stuff that you get in the oyster was gone.  Again, nothing remarkable here and if you are a serious oyster eater, check out Cakes and Ale for your money's worth.  Cheese plate, 3 selections for $12.  The cheeses were nothing remarkable.  Hit up Krog Bar or Floataway Cafe instead.  The scallop small plate was quite nice.  It was cooked well and had a nice potato or root vegetable puree underneath.  The beef carpaccio was pretty good but not amazing.  We finished it off with the trout large plate and it was cooked very well with delicious potatoes and root vegetables on the side.

What better way to do so than on a sunny, Sunday afternoon while exploring and walking around the South End?\\n\\nIronically enough, it wasn't the first choice that we had in mind for a late lunch but the Beehive was closed and this was conveniently located across the street... I saw it, and proceeded to convince (without much efforts) the girlfriend that this would be THE spot for our meal.\\n\\nWe proceeded to walk right in and immediately I had to smile upon noticing Lynch's take on a traditional butcher shop but per usual, with a twist. A clever one at that as it's a fully functional restaurant with a fully functional butcher shop in it's confines. The uniqueness of the place doesn't just apply to the retail experience as it also applies to the dining one. You won't be finding any regular tables there. Instead there's counter service or a few high tables (that's where we sat). This provides yet another twist and offers a fresh new take on dining. \\n\\nExcited, we promptly sat down and were immediately taken care of. As in all Lynch establishments service is pretty good although our waiter's breath was absolutely terrible. To the point where I almost lost my appetite and had to turn my head away in order to remain both conscious and hungry. The menu is diverse and offers everything from antipasti plates to local greens and steak tartare. There' also pasta of all sorts, something that Lynch is very well known for despite her Irish heritage and upbringing and hamburgers. Oh and there's also an interesting selection of desserts. Did I also mention the daily specials?\\n\\nBeing with the girlfriend, this made is more convenient to share and we settled, without much hesitation, for the antipasti della casa plate. At $19 a pop, it's a bit steep for an appetizer but the quantity of food on the plate, along with the quality of the cold cuts made up for it. We all all kinds of noshables on there: capicolla, parma ham, salami and hummus. There were also a few pickles veggies (carrots, broccoli) and some big chunks of parmesan cheese. The plate was massive and was devoured rather quickly. Along with it some complimentary bread was brought along with some soft butter and some honey from Vermont. Despite being complementary it was actually really good, something that most restaurants often overlook. But not here my friends, not here.\\n\\nNext came our entrees. The misses had a plate of delectable ricotta gnudi ($21) which came with some parmesan and a bolognese sauce. They were fluffy, they were light, they were delicious. As a matter of fact they were so good that we've since then tried to replicate them using Lynch's \\"Stir\\" recipe book at home... with success I might add.\\n\\nPersonally, being in a butcher shop, seeing a cooler of fresh meat in the back, I decided to try the steak tartare ($17). It came plated with some pickled onions and some toasted brioche and was made to order. The beef tasted fresh and it was pretty rich although not as good as tartare's I've had in France. It somehow missed the mark. Maybe it was the spices? The balancing of the ingredients? I'm not sure. It was good but not great. I wanted the girlfriend' gnudi instead... They were just so good.\\n\\nWe washed everything down with a couple of Titan IPAs and left rather happy. Personally, having been to other Lynch establishments, I found this one a bit overpriced, especially since Sportello is in a similar price range but offers much better food. The uniqueness and quirkiness of it is refreshing though and the butcher aspect of it is both interesting and useful. Throughout our meal there many people went in to buy some meat and various other things such as patees and pantry items of all sorts. The quality of them looked exceptional, especially the pieces of beef which had beautiful marbeling. \\n\\nAll in all, the lunch there was good, some dishes being better than others. Service was solid throughout but the actual value wasn't all that great, especially when compared to Sportello which I found cheaper and significantly better. But looking past the value, a visit there makes for a memorable experience in a unique setting. We both left happy."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"6607 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Wouldn't give me a mr.pibb soda 1 min after close, just what I need after a stressful day  #disappointed"},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Always a stop not only for me but for my friends.

(Side note: the waiter didn't know what arepas were either.  He had to ask someone.  This was his first day so I don't blame him, but HT might want to train their staff a bit.. maybe test them on their knowledge of Latin American cuisine?) In any case, they were also pretty tasty.  The chips and salsa were okay, but I didn't appreciate that they weren't complimentary, as they are in any standard taqueria.  And don't give me the excuse that it's some special Ecuadorian salsa, either, because I've had free Mexican salsa that's 5 times better!

When I asked if there was a problem--he told me I should have just ordered nachos.... I  left the food there after he said other rude things... \\n\\nThe larger problem comes with the fact that I called after to talk to him to speak to him directly. I was thinking that there was possibly a misunderstanding--I explained that I don't care for soggy nachos and would be eating them later because...teacher life...he basically told me that I was trying to steal 27.00 worth of food for 9.00 and that this situation has nothing to do with being a teacher.

Once you get to the counter you can try their flavors. Both times I went they were super patient and gave some recommendations as to which flavors pair well together. If you can't decide opt for the flight. It's 4 kids scoops served in glass cups on a wooden board. The only disadvantage of this is that the ice cream melts fairly quickly because the scoops are smaller and the glass is room temp. If the cups were just chilled it'd be the perfect option. Anyways, the HONEY LAVENDER was my favorite. The most smooth texture of all the flavors and very refreshing. Definitely try some of their seasonal offerings. They have a lot of interesting flavors that you won't find anywhere else. The SEA SALT w/ CARMEL RIBBON and ALMOND BRITTLE w/ SALTED GANACHE are super rich so if you like salted flavors go for those. Surprisingly, I really liked the OLIVE OIL. It had a subtle flavor compared to the others, but tasted exactly like EEVO.

I wish they were not as skimpy about their pickled ginger...when I want extra ginger-- I would like a bit more than one pinch!\\n\\nI did enjoy their ginger tea very much and our dinner party really did enjoy the diversity of dishes very much... We redeemed our yelp appetizer offer which was fried summer rolls and the manager was very nice and let us switch to edamame instead.

The dish was plated well. There were different textures involved from soft, creamy, crunchy and cold. I liked all those texture elements in my mouth. The radish and honey sauce was a good kick against the veggie garnishes. The sardines were basically invisible in terms of taste against the over powering sauce. I could tell that they were fresh just based on bite and texture but I tasted no distinguished flavor notes. They did make this on gluten free toast = plus points. \\n\\nSaffron Black Truffle Macaroni & Cheese gremolata, black truffle shavings, parmesan = $16 = One of the best mac and cheese dishes I've ever tasted. You get less than a cup of mac and cheese, however, it is a really rich dish. The cheese itself is flavorless and serves as a creamy texture vehicle. The real star of the dish was the truffle and saffron notes. They were unbalanced but it worked. \\n\\nDuck Leg Confit lentils du puy, sherry vinaigrette = $16 = Very moist and nicely salted. There were no real spices but just a buttery taste with salt. It balanced well with the basic lentil bed. \\n\\nPavlova = $7 = Large meringue dish topped with whip cream and fresh berries. The meringue itself was nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy like a cloud on the inside. It was a light dessert. Paired against the flavorless whip cream it balanced a bit the cavity assault.

This was our second good meal.  We escaped from the nearby Disney theme park that our friends wanted to attend and ubered to Uno's where we were greeted promptly and shown to our booth.  \\n\\nOur server, Bonnie, was exceptional -- very attentive, friendly and despite a small problem with the order -- she ordered a pepperoni pizza when we wanted a cheese pizza -- it was handled with a minimal of fuss.  \\n\\nI had a cobb salad that was fresh and flavorful.  My other half had a chicken sandwich which was also great tasting.  \\n\\nThere was a gal in the restaurant who made balloon hats and figures and that was interesting and entertaining.   We had a manager come to our table to check on things and we gave her the thumbs up -- for the food and for the service.  \\n\\nI believe that good service often makes up for lackluster food.  In this case, the food was great and the service was better.  Thanks for a great experience !!"},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I just moved close by and this bar has quickly become my go-to with the roommates. (And it's within stumbling distance to home!) The place is pretty much always packed, but it's ok, because we usually just grab a seat at the bar. The bartenders are pretty quick to get your order, and you don't even have to be a girl to get faster service! There's a lot of choices, but I usually grab one of the cocktails. My favorite so far is the Pearl White. It's not always consistent in regard to taste, but as long as the mint and lemon come through, we're good. Also, I'm not a fan of the house wine, so I would choose something else. Oh! And don't forget to specify house white or red, because they didn't ask me and gave me the white, when I assumed the red.\\n\\nWhat I've had:\\n- BUFFALO FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Consider your mind blown. You're welcome.\\n- Handmade Gnocchi with Short Rib Ragout... I enjoyed it because short rib is AWESOME, but the texture of the whole dish was a little mushier than I'd hoped. And not that I don't like a little fat on my meats, but it was a little too fatty.\\n- Spicy Jambalaya... Good amount of spice.\\n- Black Bean Veggie Burger... Good, but nothing memorable.\\n- RICOTTA and MOZZARELLA FRITTERS... Loves it. Cheeeeeeese...\\n\\nI also left my card there one drunken night and when I came back for it, they were very nice and didn't charge me tip. But, that just made me give them an even bigger tip the next time I was there. I love the entire vibe of the place, very cozy. Good food, good drinks. This place is great for a night out with friends or a date. Because it's packed, you have an excuse to get a little closer and invade your date's personal space without seeming sleazy.

It's that great balance of teamwork and comradery. The absolute hardest thing is deciding what NOT to eat. The staff always has great suggestions and will not steer you wrong.

Good service though."},{"name":"Cosi","address":"133 Federal St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I don't know, but am sure, that everyone has commented on the \\"insane\\" line by now.  I mean, the bread...everyone has mentioned the bread.  Unlike most places I review about, I didn't actual read anyone's review for this place, yet.  At any rate, that huge, monstrosity of a line is technically 2 lines if not 3; salad line, soup/sandwich line, and coffee line.  And while the line can be out of the place and outside, it moves very quickly.  First thing I saw when I walked in was a big over and two guys making freshly baked bread.  That bread looked good!  You could watch the guy cut it into the sections you get with salad and the ends he'd toss into 2 bowls on the counter for people to take a piece.  That bread is awesome! (When no one is looking, you can easily snag a second piece)\\n\\nMy coworker ordered the signature salad and I got the Shanghai chicken salad the very first time I went, so the Shanghai has become a go-to for me.  They make it all fresh in front of you and they do it in an assembly line, so orders go quickly.  They give you a decent looking portion in a nice little takeout container, and a slice of that awesome bread.  Seriously, I think it's the best bread I've ever eaten.  The salads are generally tasty though a little inconsistent with portion size depending whom you get.  I've tried the Adobo lime, tandoori chicken, and smartfit salads.  I've also tried their steak rice bowl.  Everything is pretty solid, but Shanghai is still my favorite. \\n\\nBack to the bread, by far the best part of lunch.  Even after 5 or so minutes, it was still HOT.  It was so fresh and warm and tasty.... ahh, it was the best.  Seriously, I frequently contemplate getting a loaf on the way home from work some weeknights.  It's that good.\\n\\nThe actual cafe/restaurant part is pretty nice.  I can't get a good idea for how large it is because it was packed with people all over the place.  It looks like it seats maybe 20-30 inside and they have a nice patio and outside seating for maybe another 20 more.  Everything looked clean and the staff were all friendly enough.  And when you go to pay, they bag your food and put in napkins and plasticware.  Good on them!\\n\\nAlso, about the bread - when they ask if you want bread, if you give puppy dog eyes and ask nicely for two pieces (holding up two fingers helps), they generally give you the second piece for free.\\n\\nAlso also, it's been a few years since I've had one, but I remember their breakfast sandwiches being very good.\\n\\n\\nMenu Selection: Good - very Good\\nPrice: Good\\nValue: Good\\nCleanliness: Very Good\\nParking: N/A\\nOverall: Yes, even if it's just for the bread.\\n\\n3 stars for the food, 6 stars for the bread (yes, it's that good)."},{"name":"Cafe Agora Midtown","address":"92 Peachtree Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"First time and the food was on point!

The food however was bland and most of the sushi signature rolls were tempura - too much fried food.  The Crown roll had a fried tortilla on top of each piece - tasty, but again too much fried food.  The Volcano roll was really greasy.  The Gang roll had curry sauce on it, making it unique and flavorful.  The ginger salad was the very \\"wet\\" liquid ginger dressing, which I am not a fan of.  The wonton soup was very good, hot and flavorful.  Dumplings and Thai iced tea were both good as well.  It's the sushi that was the fail.  If I'm there again, at someone else's request - I will try more of the Thai menu and pass on the sushi."},{"name":"Louisville Rex","address":"817 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3","text":"The Rex.... interesting.

We had the guacamole which was made right in front of us. It was perfect because I got extra cilantro which I love. I got the chicken tacos for my main entree, hubby got Tex Mex burger. I enjoyed my meal and hubby did too. The food tested fresh and had much flavor which I appreciate. The kids meal comes with a make your own Sunday which was nice. Our server was great! It wasn't busy at the time we went so I don't know how much of a difference that would have made but we will definitely visit again."},{"name":"Melton's App & Tap","address":"2500 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"About time I got back here - my previous few visits were all pre-renovation, years ago. Back then, my opinion was that Melton's is a surprisingly nice neighborhood bar with pretty decent food, if a bit heavy on the fried. Post-renovation, that opinion stands. I need to come here more often.\\n\\nThe menu is great - lots to chose from - but we were hankering for nachos. They have a few nacho choices, but none were what we really wanted - a Texas-style nacho plate: chips with lots of melted cheese and generous jalapenos. Maybe some black beans. However, we found if you order Melton's Chicken & Bean nachos and hold the chicken, we'd be happy. That said, the Irish nachos seem like a must-try. Another time.\\n\\nWe also were happy with the salmon salad. Maybe the salmon could have been kicked up a notch, but very nice overall.\\n\\nApple pie and ice cream is awesome.\\n\\nGood draft beer list here and I really like how they present the choices on their board. Easy to read even for these tired eyes. It's the details that make a difference sometimes.\\n\\nSuper friendly bar service and super quick and efficient food delivery.\\n\\nAlthough I like sitting at the bar while in a pub, my only criticism here is the design of the bartop itself. I don't like the swoopy, rounded, raised edge thing. It makes it harder to rest your elbows, as you should at the bar. \\n\\nEasy parking until it fills up. Not sure where you go then. But there's a lot of spaces.\\n\\nNot loud.\\n\\nThey don't have Wi-Fi and they need to.\\n\\nRecommended."},{"name":"Red House Restaurant","address":"24 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"The worst restaurant in the world.

Job took the call and when I explained I wanted to order cheesecake he disconnected the call. So I called back and who do I get again? Job. So I explained he hung up and with a very nasty attitude explained I wanted to order cheesecake. He was so sarcastic. With attitude he informed me that my cheesecake will be ready when I walked in. WTH. Excuse me for trying to order ahead and forgive me for not knowing that this location isn't busy. I'd rather deal with high crowds and better attitudes than with someone who speaks as if my money isn't welcomed.

It's completely renovated so you may not recognize it at first, which is a huge refreshing feeling. \\n\\nHeaded over and grabbed a two seat table top outside this week for lunch. I was there with a huge fan, Dana R, so I let her choose all of the dishes and she led me in the right direction! The service was a bit slow for lunch and they were not packed or anything, I am assuming it was because we were outside? I had to request a water refill a few times. The food came out pretty promptly though and everything was served with great presentation and temperature. \\n\\nUpon our arrival I checked in on Yelp and scored free springs rolls and they were a delight. Two rolls, served cut in two and they didn't appear to be your typical spring roll that is overdone and greasy, this was a true delight. So much so that when our main dishes came I waiting to dive in until I finished my spring rolls. The dipping sauce we delicious and a fabulous pair. \\n\\nThe crown roll was our sushi of choice and it was overly impressive, when it arrived I literally said \\"WOW!\\" really loud. I was so pumped to shove a piece in my mouth. Not sure of all the ingredients but it was mainly imitation crab, cream cheese in a tempura battered roll topped with a won ton cracker... are you kidding me? Yes, it was as epic as you are imagining in your head. The flavor and texture was perfect. There is no way I could have finished that roll by myself, it was HUGE. We didn't even finish it splitting it between two people. \\n\\nWe also split a main entree, their special which we were told will appear on their final menu: Avenue Chicken. It is served in a crispy wont ton bowl, with a side of white rice, broccoli, carrots and snap peas. The chicken is lightly breaded and tossed in a Thai sauce that is peppery to a flavorful perfection but not spicy hot which is exactly how I like it. It was basically popcorn chicken that I wanted to take everywhere with me, I could not stop eating it. The pepper flavor popped with each piece and I couldn't get enough. \\n\\nOverall it was a delightful experience and I can't wait to go back to try more rolls and dishes."},{"name":"Avenue Thai and Sushi","address":"525 S Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This is a place I would definitely go again.

We left over half of our salads on our plates and the server never asked a word.\\n\\n- On another visit in January, we were the only ones in the large dining room on a Thursday night.  The wait staff was terrible.  We could never get our water filled, they were slow, once again we had bland food and it took 5 minutes to get the salt as they were spending all of their time in the jazz bar.  I don't think it was the same salt shaker as previously mentioned, as it was also clogged, but we cleaned it with an extra fork.  I ordered the salmon medium rare which came well done.  It was another long wait for the waiter who did take the fish back.  It was funny (not really) when it came back, and the new piece was at least as well done as the first.

Seriously, she was fantastic. Last night, we decided to go again and take a friend with us, as we are all new to the area and still looking for good places to eat. The closing time said 10pm, we walked in at 9:14pm. Upon walking in, a shorter, slim, dark haired girl said \\"ohh no were closed\\" in a joking manner under her breath, but it was loud enough that I heard it. Hearing that, I looked to my husband who was about to be seated by Audrey and said I think they were closing. He asked Audrey, who told us that they closed at 930pm, but we were welcome to stay and eat. We opted to leave because we aren't the type of people to come in within minutes of closing. We understand everyone wants to go home at their scheduled time. However, the door and website clearly say 10pm and when my husband called to verify that, the manager said the dine in closed at 930, but they do deliveries and take out until 10. It would have been nice to have been told that, as opposed to hearing an exasperated quip upon walking in and feeling like our presence was a burden. We would have simply placed a to-go order. The manager also told us that she was not allowed to give out her superiors name. I wonder how the owner feels about not being able to hear customer feedback in order to improve their establishments business? I would love to be able to add stars to this rating, but as a consumer I cannot until given the proper outlets for complaint resolutions.\\n3/15/18: Round 2.

Just as rude as ever, and we are are eating the subpar food we picked up while waiting for the replacement pizza and the salad they forgot to be delivered. Pictures of the pizza attached.

My dad is crazy about the durian shakes, and my mom the traditional iced coffee.  They feel at home.  They were even approached by the owner to have our Cambodian reception for our wedding there.  Um, no thanks mom -- it seats like 13 people.  But it was still a sweet offer regardless. :)\\n\\nI'm anxiously awaiting the relaunch of Floating Rock in the Mass Ave restaurant.  According to Jenny, they're looking to expanding their menu to be reminiscent of Tangierino.  I'm a little sad about this because it's always been my go to for classic Khmer dishes.

Who would be happy to wait 1.5 hour for an appetizer? Plus we asked the server many times while we were waiting, he gave us different excuses to try to get rid of us! Well if your kitchen is too busy to make tempura, then do not keep us waiting! If your kitchen has no enough ppl to cook, do not keep your customers waiting!

The octopus was my second favorite with the spicy vinegar sauce that I thought really went well with the mild flavor of the octopus. The chicken butts and quail eggs tied on the bottom Not that they weren't good. I would have liked the quail eggs to be a tad more on the soft boiled side then hard, but they were still good. The chicken butts are scary in name only - they tasted like grilled thigh meat but the dipping sauce was good. \\n\\nI'll add I was there for lunch not dinner and the place was pretty much packed by 12 on Tuesday.

The cheese and charcuterie starter was delightfully savory with a nice pinot blanc. Salads, a lemon caesar and a berries with spring mix, came with soup shots. The mushroom soup was lovely. This course featured a subtle pinot gris, which we liked better than the sweet blanc. My wife had the salmon over quinoa and black rice, which she loved, especially paired with the pinot noir. I enjoyed the maple-brined pork chop entree. The brining made the chop unbelievably tender and moist. Just luscious. Competing for its attention, though, was a savory cheddar apple bread pudding. Baked to perfection, it was fantastically indulgent. A robust malbec was well-paired. Dinner closed with gewurtztraminer and a dessert trio, the standout of which was an espresso shot poured over a small scoop of hazelnut ice cream.\\n\\nAs good as our meals were, Picnic House's atmosphere, decor, and pace were equally enjoyable.

You make sure it's extra fancy too if it's culminating a landmark event in your life. Well my meal at Beast was extra special with my group of friends because it marked a new chapter in each of our lives.\\n\\nBEAST is a French-inspired, no substitutions, revolving 6-course prix fixe dinner ($75pp), which is offered Wednesday through Saturday at 6 & 8:45 PM. Reservations = highly recommended since each seating houses about 25 people. A four-course brunch is offered during Sundays at 10AM & 12PM ($35pp). This tiny restaurant embodies farm to table communal dining with Chef Pomeroy's flair. [**OPTIONAL** For $35 more you can have a wine-pairing with each 6-course meal; $20 for 4-course brunch.] \\n\\nSo what did the $75 buy me?\\n#1: ONION CONSOMME was very savory. A delicious broth made with dry vermouth, spring radish and curly cress. A very light dish to cleanse your palette for the following dishes.\\n\\n#2 CHARCUTERIE PLATE. Ah, yes the infamous charcuterie place offered 12 different types of items. My favorite: FOIE GRAS BON BON (very rich and delightful). Other admirable, savory and guilty small bites on the plate: chicken liver mousse, steak tartare, quail egg toast, pork liver terrine, rabbit rillettes and tete de cochon.\\n\\n#3 LAMB LOIN CHOP was cooked oh-so delicious. The lamb-syrah au jus was sensational! Lots of flavors were going on and delivered in every bite. This was complimented with a chard roll with mint and ricotta cheese. A side of artichokes completed this dish.\\n\\n#4 LEVAIN BREAD SALAD was very light, flavorful and a great way to start a fourth meal after a heavy 2nd and 3rd dish. This salad was made with arugula, asparagus, pea shoots, pickled red onions and rhubarb with sheep's cheese was drizzled with a nice vinaigrette. The bread served as a type of crouton - the texture was a bit different that your normal crouton. It was different, interesting and decent.\\n\\n#5 CHEESE PLATE offered three types of different cheeses which came with a poached plum, candied hazelnuts, honey and a peppercorn shortbread cookie. This was a lighter version of the charcuterie plate.\\n\\n#6 OLIVE OIL CAKE was quite divine. This dessert was very light, refreshing and very mouth-gasm worthy. The olive oil cake had a strawberry/apricot sauce and the white chocolate whipped mousse was delightful. \\n\\nI opted to not do the wine pairing since it was a bit too much to consume in a three hour meal. Instead I chose one glass of red wine since I was driving.\\n\\nService was sensational. Water glasses were filled 24/7. I enjoyed the detailed description of each plate from our servers.\\n\\nOregonian, Naomi Pomeroy - Food and Wine's Best New Chef (2009), Top Chef Masters Chef-testant (Season 3) and Cochon 555 - Portland winner (2012), serves up a scrumptious feast in her open kitchen.

She said \\"I am sitting you here to give you more time to eat\\". I said, okay?? It was 5p. She then moved us to the corner, we were thankful, but as she gave us our menus she said that we would need to leave before 7p because the table had a 7p reservation... it would only take us an hour if the service was prompt. There was no need to tell us we would have to leave. Regardless, service was prompt, we left around 6p. The next day I was checking my bank statement and noticed my bar tab was higher than what I paid (I kept the customer copy). Turns out the bartenders wanted more money than what I gave them ($1.50 tip on a $14.00 glass of wine). I don't think 1 pour of wine justifies the $3.00 they changed it to.

I've been here twice, and both times thought that the food was really good and the ambiance bright and tropical (very unlike the Cambridge/Boston area). \\n\\nThe stews that seemed to be the most memorable are the tripe/bean/bacon stew and another black bean/meat stew (the latter was over a year ago, so it's fuzzy in my head now). The tripe stew is really rich and warms you up. It was well seasoned and particularly appealing because of the pork fat (how can one say no to pork fat?!). \\n\\nTheir classic fish stew is surprisingly a bit lacking, especially compared to their meat stews. My lovely said that he felt that there was an aromatic or a spice lacking, as though they forgot to add garlic or something else to add another dimension? The fish itself was good, though, yet nothing to get too excited about.\\n\\nThe juices here are also worth mentioning. Last weekend I had the mango/blueberry/passion fruit juice, and it was so refreshing! The juices here are fresh squeezed, and you can definitely taste that they are fresh squeezed. A little pricey, but then again fresh-squeezed juice everywhere is, and the combinations here are a bit different than what you would normally expect.\\n\\nOne downside is that the place is a little on the small side, and the floors tend to be uneven (when the waitress would walk by my table to get through an aisle, I always felt like my chair was sinking just a little deeper into the ground).

There are so many Thai, Vietnamese and Korean places throughout all four corners of this town and surrounding areas that I'm sure just those foods alone would keep one busy for many, many years.\\n\\nNumber 1 Bento is within the city block of food carts down by SW Alder and Number 1 is right on the southwest corner adjacent to a German food cart. First off, over there I almost never know what to get. Was I getting Egyptian, Greek, Hawaiian, a bahn mi? I had it narrowed down to Korean and Egyptian and then I saw what I'd be getting and for only fifty cents more and I'd get sooooo much more food? No Brainer.\\n\\nAs with most Asian cuisines, you get a bang for your buck. Only $6.50 and I got bulgogi, rice, salad, kimchi and glass noodles. Plus a buck for a bottle of water. The two women working inside looked as if they'd been at this all their lives. The food was fairly quick to arrive and nice and hot (heat), I added my own hot to it with some sriracha.  The said was just some iceberg lettuce with a sweet cream dressing on it. Not sure what it was, but it was decent. I'm no expert on kimchi, so I can't say what's amazing kimchi as of yet, but this version was sour tasting with a little vinegar to it. I enjoyed it. The glass noodle were room temp and balanced out the heat from the steaming sticky rice and bulgogi. The bulgogi was so good. Sweet and spicy and they were not skimpy with it. I wouldn't be lying to say that the plastic clamshell was holding roughly three pounds of food, and I didn't leave any of it.\\n\\nThis Korean food at Number 1 Bento was well worth it, and I'm sure the other offerings are just as good and just as filling.

I appreciated it simplicity, cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and roe atop a fried slice of potato.  It allowed for the ingredients to shine though, without muddying the flavors.\\n\\nWe also had the grilled octopus, which in theory could have been great, but it was not properly executed.  The protein was not charred enough, the dish was under seasoned, and my biggest complaint was that the \\"hash browns\\" appear to have been left over from brunch.

I could not let my wife pay and we decided to split the bill.  Oh, by the way they say they take credit cards and they do; just not Discover so we used MasterCard and put the tip in that. (We usually tip cash.)   Also I would have expected them to comp me for the drink but they did not.  Very unprofessional.  The place is not run right. A lot of the other reviews say the same or similar.  May be the draw is the music but we did not stay for it and I would not want to be in the lounge once the horns started, I play guitar and the acoustics are horrible.  This place is over-priced, slow, spotty service, and the drinks come with their own apps IN them!

Here's the link to the menu: http://www.rinosplace.com/menu.html\\n\\nMy order and take on it:\\nCALAMARI - calamari battered & fried and finished in a spicy pepper ring sauce $12 (OMG, the best calamari I have ever had because the taste is sooo complete! There's is no marinara or any sort of sauce needed for this dish. I don't know what it is, but the spicy pepper ring brings this dish a whole level up. Don't be scared, it's not spicy at all!)\\n\\nVITELLO MARSALA - scallopini of veal sauteed with mushrooms and ham. Finished in a marsala wine sauce $12 (Veal is beaten down to a pulp with a layer of ham on top and another layer of cheese on top of that. It's so tender! Marsala sauce is perfect with this...if you don't want to carbo load, get any of the Marsala dishes depending what kind of meat you're craving for...yum!\\n\\nGNOCCHI - homemade potato dumplings sauteed in a fresh plum tomato sauce and topped with fresh mozzarella and baked $15 (OMG, I could make this dish into four meals...it's so filling, but so worth it! The dish is perfectly cheesy and bouncy!)\\n\\nLOBSTER RAVIOLI - Their star dish of Rino's and featured on FOOD network. It's absolutely the best lobster ravioli I have ever had and it's something you must get and share among your party. DO IT!\\n\\nFrutti Di Mare - Seafood overload beyond belief. They do not skimp on their portion on this dish and it's so fresh! You get to pick whatever type of pasta you desire to complement this dish and I went with the fusilli pasta, yum!\\n\\nTiramisu - Perfect end to the meal and it's so creamy and delicious! You might as well pair it off with a cup of cappuccino or coffee :)\\n\\nOverall, my dinner was a phenomenal experience at Rino's.

Tonight was the last straw for me. Just as was previously written, the service is really slow, disgustingly so! The food tonight was salty. My friends had some sort of shrimp and scallop/pasta dish (salty). It was expensive and worth nowhere near what it costs. I had the seared tuna. While it was good, it was nowhere near worth the $26 bucks they charged. If you want to spend the money, go to Seasons 52. The price is the same and the food, the restaurant and atmosphere is much, much better! Needless to say the service will delight you as well. Tonight, after we walked out, we found they had already charged us $33 dollars for gratuity for a party of FIVE on a $167 tab! That worked out to be about 20 percent, even without notifying us. Maybe it was written on the menus. I'm not sure. The total bill was 210.66 and we added another 20 percent on top of that! When we got to our car, we thought the bill was high and double-checked it. Needless to say, I went back inside to rectify this error. I'm sure the waiter would have been content to let us drive off without asking us if we intended to leave $66 dollars for him. A couple of years ago, I had a guy take our order and never return to serve us. The guy cleaning the tables went and got our drinks 25 minutes later, while the waiter had been sitting at a nearby table trying to chat up five women. According to a manager I spoke to the next night, this guy had  already made $310 bucks in tips that night and I guess he really didn't care if we got served or not!

Wow, as much as I tried to be OK with the servers that never come back after the food is served except to leave the check I still have a strong dislike for POOR service, cold food, long waits, and servers that think they are entitled to a big tip just because they brought your food to you even if they do NOT stay long enough to ask if you want anything else.  I am very particular and after having been disappointed so many times I DO NOT recommend this establishment for anything of quality or remarkable character.  Once they were in the Entertainment Book and the Manager Huey Na  always complained about my coupons and wanted to add a surcharge without any authority to do so.  They claim to have a happy hour when infact they only have one menu and the so called happy hour prices are always in effect ( who do they think they are fooling?)

Yep, pretty much ideal in my book.  Oh, and did I mention free valet and self parking?  And $1 oysters?

I had planned this event out weeks in advance - he was great when I visited him in person and over the phone - and although he did not have karaoke as I wanted (he said there is no more karaoke.. they just used to have it), we ended up having a live band there, which was nice (a little loud for our crowd to talk over but actually the music was on the mellow side and a nice touch).  \\n\\nWhen we got there, he tried to give us parking passes to his free lot, but my friends parked at the meter out front - nice to see he'd think of that.  As we sat down, he brought us over sombreros and cool glass guns filled with tequila to take pictures with.  He then came and brought us menus and told us we could order from the lunch or dinner menu - whatever we wanted!  Throughout the dinner we got essentially all the tasty chips, salsa, guacamole and pitchers of margaritas/sangrias we could want.  We had a fantastic dinner with great drinks - both the food and the drinks were made with authentic Mexican ingredients - the alcohol seemed of decent quality.  I personally had something with what I thought were a glorious combination of ingredients, including shrimp, avocado, corn cake, and refried beans.. mmm!  I have been to Mexico several times and felt like the stuff on their menu, like this was authentic - like the mole, etc. \\n\\nThe fun and excitement happened even more when he helped me fix up my macho man pinata that I made.  He helped rig it up and he was bouncing it around so it was funny to see the girls swinging at it.  It was really awesome of him to let us do that in the restaurant!  One of my games was a little more risque, so we ended up leaving that to do at the bridal shower, but being able to play that at least was fantastic.  \\n\\nI got really good vibes from Roberto - we talked with him at the bar toward the end of the party.  He had given us a good party discount of sorts and it ended up being really very reasonable.  I felt like he was very generous and happy to host a great party where we could all have fun and enjoy ourselves with a fabulous fiesta.  It doesn't get any better than that!  \\n\\nIt's funny.. this place has mixed reviews on yelp, so I wasn't sure about it at first when I was picking out a place for the bachelorette party.. but if you're hosting an event like this, you may find that this is the relaxed and fun environment that's perfect for you and your friends!"},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Just OK for me.

We strolled in, to discover how cutely decorated this restaurant is, how funny and witty our server is, and how amazing the food was! It was the best decision EVER to eat dinner number two here. This honestly was probably my favorite meal in Portland.\\n\\nFirst off, our server was absolutely hilarious and sarcastic -- I love it! He made dinner so entertaining :) He also gave great suggestions and checked on us constantly. As weird as it sounds, I secretly wished he could be my friend in real life...\\n\\nNow, onto the food... for the appetizers, I recommend the Moroccan cauliflower and the duck fat potatoes! The Cauliflower was so flavorful, with a great assortment of spices sprinkled on it! And, the duck fat potatoes... mmm... who doesn't love potatoes doused in fat? Hey, and don't feel bad. They did a study in France and noticed those who ate more duck fat were less likely to have cancer...\\n\\nAnd the main dish... get the pork chop. It was so divine! It was a bit on the dry side, but loved the flavors and the mixture of sweetness on it. \\n\\nFinally, the dessert. You must get the pavlova! It's a definitely a picture-worthy moment upon arrival, so get your camera ready. It's this ginormous dessert with whipped cream and berries that can feed 4 people. It's also reasonably priced. The last time I had it was in San Francisco for the same price and a size of my palm. I loved how they added their own twist with Granny Smith Apples to add a sour tang to the treat.\\n\\nPicnic House, I'm so glad we ate here.

Partly I'm spoiled, I spent 15 years living in LA living right next to \\"real\\" Japanese grocery stores like Mitsuwa, Marukai and Nijiya.  Uwajimaya, while it has a decent selection of Japanese beer and sake, in every other area, especially the fish department, it's not good.  They make a very sorry attempt at packaging up fish meant to be served as sushi, it always looks like it's been sitting out for days and days.  They never have anything remotely exotic like mirugai, if they had it, it wouldn't be fresh anyway so what would be the point.  :P  The mirugai they do have is live or maybe not, in some nasty fish tank. There doesn't seem to be any pride or effort put in here.   For the most part, the fish department is laid out in a manner consistent with the Korean grocery stores in K-town in LA.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but for sure Uwajimaya is not presenting in the Japanese way.  When it comes to their veggies, we are usually able to find some good organic daikon, but when it comes to care and attention and doing it the Japanese way they are missing the mark here as well.  Every time I check to see if they have fresh shiso, it looks like it's been sitting out for a week or more.  The wilted leaves we always see motivated us to just buy and plant our own shiso plants, since we cannot count on getting something fresh at Uwajimaya.  People seem to think that this place is really amazing, but I think this is only because they have zero competition.  I'm not saying don't go here, but in my opinion they are more of an \\"asian\\" grocery store with a Japanese name.  The one thing really want from them, good fish, isn't there to be found.  We do go there to pick up a few basics every other week or so.  My wife is Japanese, so she picks up her natt≈ç supply, and maybe I'll grab some hitachino while we are there, but on balance we've both been really disappointed.  Uwajimaya is not at the level of quality I've come to associate with Mitsuwa, Marukai and Nijiya in LA.  I'm really disappointed that there's no alternative in the Portland area.  Maybe if they had some competition they would up their game.  Alternatively, Uwajimaya  management could take a field trip to Nijiya's fish department in LA and take a lesson on how to do fish the right way.

With its incursion into candlepin country, Kings was a rarity - a bowling center opening during a time when hundreds of other centers nationwide were closing.  But Kings is more than just bowling - there's a full-service lounge, pool tables, and Big Buck Hunter, among other things.  I came here on my 21st birthday almost seven years ago, and I have been back many times since (mostly with an informal league).\\n\\nI've always found the facilities themselves to be pretty nice.  The lanes, ball returns, rental shoes, house balls, etc. are in very good shape.  The glow-in-the-dark lanes and the projection screens (perfect for watching the Sox game) are nice touches.  However, this place loses a star because of its pinsetters.  I worked in a bowling center off and on for five years.  One thing that I learned is that it doesn't matter how good your food is or how modern your decor is if the machines don't go up and down.  We've had several occasions where the machines have stopped while we were bowling.  Sometimes, it takes more than one trip to the front desk to get them to act upon the problem.  I certainly do not blame the tech working down back.  I know from experience that it's loud and chaotic and that one needs to work both quickly and safely.  I think that Kings would do well to invest in more preventive maintenance to reduce pinsetter downtimes.  Every time a machine goes down, it costs them money because they can't turn the lanes over more quickly, and I think that they should recognize that.\\n\\nKings has pretty good music if you like classic 80s and 90s music videos interspersed with today's hits.  However, it is way too loud.  A bowling center is loud enough, and I think that it's important to recognize that some customers may be put off by the music being so loud.  Turn the music down just a notch or two and people will be that much happier.\\n\\nOverall, I think Kings is a good bowling center right in the heart of the Back Bay.  Now, if only they would throw us a bone with four candlepin lanes..."},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Completely disappointed in the customer service today.

My cousin was able to reserve the brewery room to make the night extra special. It was a pretty great experience since I've always wanted to eat at that particular table. You can see it as you walk towards the bar, so it kind of makes you feel like you're in a cage with everyone looking at you. Once you enter the room, you can't really hear anything going on outside of it. Once we were sat our waiter told us that it was the last night that they were going to have people dine in that room. Reason being is they are looking to add a few more tanks to produce more beer. It was a bittersweet feeling because it was a unique experience that I would've loved to have enjoyed again. Since it can get pretty noisy at C&L it is a little difficult to speak with the people at your table. That's why the brewery room was a great experience for me. Now, on to the food! We were still a little full from the lunch we had earlier in the day so my wife and I wanted to order some apps and split an entree. We knew exactly which apps we wanted since we had been here before, but we also wanted to try some other apps. Fortunately, C&L has an option where you can get 4 apps for $25, so we went for the brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, hush puppies, and the fries. Now the brussel sprouts are a no brainer.(MUST HAVE!) They are cooked and seasoned perfectly, which is why it is my wife and I's favorites. The mac & cheese is delicious with a little bit of spice, but nothing too crazy. The C&L hush puppies were fried to perfection and came with this jalepeno remoulade that gave it a perfect kick. Our fourth app was the C&L fries that are seasoned with rosemary, garlic, and parmesan. We completely forgot about the ketchup because we immediately fell in love with the fries. Definitely gotta get that one too. Our group shared the Pimento Cheese which is another fan favorite. They initially don't provide enough toasted sliced bread for the spread but they will gladly offer you more if they see pimento cheese left. The spread itself is something to cheer for. They throw a little extra something in it that makes it stand out from the typical/simple pimento cheese spreads. I tried to figure out what it is that they do different with each taste...or maybe it's an excuse to go for seconds, thirds, fourths, etc. For the entree, my wife and I split the butcher burger (cooked medium well) since she can't eat medium, and it was the perfect amount to split. The bacon mushroom jam was without a doubt, the star of that burger. That jam is so good you can put it on almost anything. I would love to give this burger another go, but cooked medium instead. Of course for libations I order the public house old fashioned. I've recently become a fan of Old Forester bourbon, so I'll try any drink that uses this particular bourbon. It is now one of my personal favorites. They don't overdo it with the bitters and the smoked simple syrup adds an interesting flavor to this classic cocktail.

We also had chips and guacamole which was underwhelming and kind of tasted stale - no flavor at all. We also tried the deviled eggs which were meh - I make better. I had the veggie burger and have to say it was one of the worst I've ever had. Super thick and chalky black beans I took my burger apart and cut the patty I half. Fries were good, but overall an ok meal. My boyfriend had the catfish po'boy which he loved!

Granted, I don't do it very often but it so consistently disappoints that I shouldn't even bother.\\n\\nFirstly, the standard things they put on a sandwich are bland.  Shredded iceburg lettuce, Mayo and Swiss cheese or processed cheese food.  Actually the menu board says cheddar and Swiss but I consistently only taste and see Swiss on the cold subs.  Finish up with some chopped peperoncini and mustard.  It's not colorful or flavorful.\\n\\nSecondly, the amount of meat you get on a standard sandwich is VERY light.  If it is more than 2 ounces of sliced meat I am shocked.  The menu has two and four meat options and oddly, the 2 meat sandwich is exactly the same price as the single meat.  Does that mean I could get two of the same tiny servings of meat or that I get two even smaller half sized servings of meat?\\n\\nLastly, there isn't much good to compensate the bad. The airport location has a flat screen TV and DVD player but it is almost always looping on the DVD menu screen with some annoying DVD menu theme playing over and over and over.  The employees vary from serviceable to pretty clueless to disgruntled.  And they often don't know how to put the airport employee discount in.  Also, though this location is the one I go to most often, I've been to the location on Sandy and the one along the max line near 12th and Morrison too and they didn't fare much better.\\n\\nThe best thing I've had at BTH is the panini.

The employee then told me that they wouldn't be able to complete my order anyway because they weren't delivering anymore.  Baffled as to why PIZZA HUT- seriously- stopped delivering pizza on a Sunday evening, I asked to speak to the manager thinking this might be some hoax or epic mix up...\\nThe manager gets on the line, tells me that in fact they aren't delivering that they were so backed up from previous orders that it would be after midnight to just catch up.  I told her that this was ridiculous and I wanted a full refund, that I was contacting corporate- and she hung up on me.\\nI called back later since I hadn't received an email or anything else verifying I requested a full refund.  When I called, I got the manager, she knew who I was because she responded right away that it would show up as a refund in about 5 business days without asking any information from me.  I then confirmed that she was the manager and that she remembered me, then told her she hung up on me, and that was totally uncalled for. Granted no one wants to hear someone calling them out, but there wasn't any justifiable reason to hang up on me.  I wasn't cursing, verbally abusive, circling the drain on a rant, etc.  I then told her I was contacting corporate because of the whole situation and how it was handled.\\nI'm just dumbfounded that Pizza Hut could be such a mess, and completely run into the ground like that on a Sunday night.  The whole situation was mishandled.  I would be mortified if I had to call delivery orders and tell people they couldn't be completed and profusely apologetic.  I still can't believe how flippant they were about completely failing, and then adding insult to injury hanging up on me.  I understand things happen, but they didn't even care, offer anything sincere for an apology or explanation.  Ridiculous.\\nIf I were the owner, I would be livid at the hundreds of dollars lost tonight, and the horrible customer service.

It is clear that this place is trying hard to be hip, which is ok. However, it does have a very corporate, wannabe hipster vibe, which I generally find to be the worst kinda hip.

They had a couple open tables up front, but they were only set for two people. We asked if it was ok if the three of us sat at the table and they replied with surprising rudeness that seating three at a two person table was strictly forbidden. Not cool dude, but if that is their policy, so be it. So, instead we tried to find a nook or cranny where we could stand. While we were trying to find a spot, the same employee came up to us every 30 seconds or so (this seriously happened ~5 times) and told us we couldn't stand in an empty 6 foot-wide \\"fire lane\\" (where they going to drive a truck through or something?!). We had no intention of standing in their \\"fire lane\\" for long, but the \\"official standing room area\\" was totally packed--I mean these people were making me question the Kepler conjecture and rethink closest packing lattice regimes. I though it might be possible for us to squeeze in if a Japanese railway pusher showed up, but short of that we were SOL. So, after growing tired of the constant reminders that we had to move, couldn't sit, and had no place to stand, we had to abandon the Beat Hotel and seek out a less stuffy joint.

Yeah that's what I imagine this crappy \\"steak\\" quesadilla tastes like... why did I sit fourteen minutes (LITERALLY FOURTEEN MINUTES!) for a disgusting quesadilla that went straight in the trash? There was no one in line ahead of me. Not a single person. What took fourteen minutes?! It's definitely not the high quality meat. You couldn't pay me to try that again! Nor the crispness of the tortilla considering the cheese inside wasn't even melted. It was probably the window cashier talking to what must have been the one other person working since I certainly know he didn't come back to tell me \\"hey it's gonna be another five minutes\\" or even acknowledge that I had been there long enough to have gone to store, bought the ingredients, and made the food myself.

The dishes are small, so you can order several to try and share...they also are adventurous so if you are a chicken-fingers-only kind of person and not into trying different meats, veggies, sauces or spices, this is probably not the place for you.

I should have just ordered the BBQ meat and not tacos....  My husband got the cheese steak and it was very light on meat and severely heavy on VERY sweet onions and peppers.

I'm honestly a little sad that I have to write this review, because I have been to Little Trouble several times and had generally good experiences. However, during my last visit, the manager treated my friends and me with such disrespect and unprofessionalism that I will never return.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Maria (manager) chose to withhold 2 of my friends' real IDs because she \\"looked at a YouTube video that said Illinois IDs are easily faked.\\" We were forced to call the police when she said she would not return the IDs until the next day - both friends were visiting from Chicago and had flights to catch in the morning, which we tried to explain to her with no success. When we asked what specifically looked suspicious about the cards, she could not give an answer. She later told the police officers that she \\"got a vibe\\" from us that justified her actions (but when the police questioned her and assured her the IDs were real, she said she \\"would love to have pretty girls like [us] back for drinks because it's good for business.\\")\\n\\nThe funny thing is, this all happened before midnight on a Thursday night. We were sober and had literally just sat down at the bar; we had hardly said anything to her or each other when she confiscated the IDs to \\"check them in the back\\" (read: consult a YouTube video). She proceeded to tell us several times, very aggressively, that we can \\"go elsewhere to CONTINUE drinking\\" and called a security guard to escort us out. The security guard on duty was very reasonable and shared our frustration with the situation, agreeing that the manager's behavior was out of line. Even the other bartender working told us she could not believe what was happening. Maria just seemed very angry and intent on causing a scene for absolutely no reason; maybe we caught her on a bad night, but nobody in the customer service industry should act with such unwarranted aggression.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a very disappointing and frankly unbelievable experience. It is ridiculous that the police had to be involved for such a minor issue, but the manager's persistently aggressive behavior did not leave another choice. Had she calmly and professionally addressed the issue, there would not have been a problem. Our only consolation was the police officers' sympathy and shared frustration, but I wish something more could be done so this does not happen to other customers in the future. My advice - avoid Little Trouble if you are from out of town, look at all under 30, or give off any sort of \\"vibe\\"."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this restaurant.

It was busy, which we expected, and we waited about 30 min for a table. It was an ok experience, and I would go back for the atmosphere and the drinks, but not for the food or the service. \\n\\nPros: Her Highland Fling cocktail was delicious, and I appreciated the quality draft beer (Dogfish 60 min). \\nThe atmosphere is cool and relaxing, everyone seemed like they were having a good time. I like the shabby chic decor. \\n\\nCons: Constant upselling. As soon as we sat at the bar to wait for our table, we got our drinks and the bartender gave us a menu in case we wanted an appetizer while we waited. This is SOP for all restaurants. However, when another bartender asked us about 3 minutes later, followed by the original bartender again, it was a little much. They seemed disappointed that we didn't want to eat while we waited to eat. This theme continued throughout our meal. I realize that HK is a turn and burn style restaurant, but I felt rushed throughout. I had barely set my knife down when my entree plate was cleared and I was asked if I wanted to replace my half full beer with a fresh one. Perhaps the staff is simply trying to be super attentive to needs, but it comes off as rushing the diner and trying to boost avg. check. \\n\\nMy other gripe is the food. It was merely ok. The Pumpkin ravioli were as good as frozen pumpkin ravioli can be...which is to say not memorable. The Chile Relleno was VERY tasty but looked a mess on the plate. I had a venison stroganoff special, which was also tasty but did not have enough sauce. Also, the meat did not have enough of a braise on it and was pretty tough. All in all the dish was a missed opportunity, especially for 21.95, which is well above other entree prices. A little finesse would have gone a long way. \\n\\nFinally, it is LOUD and cramped. This was fine by us, but do not  go to HK expecting an intimate dinner. Like I said, I would go back for a drink, and I would probably try one of their delicious sounding sandwiches, but overall it was a miss for me."},{"name":"Pho Curry Ford","address":"3334 Curry Ford Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious food, clean, servers are fast and kind, I loved it.
