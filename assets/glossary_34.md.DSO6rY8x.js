Confronted with such wrecking disasters, the memories of OIW quickly slipped away.The second reason (more understandable, I believe) is the charismatic young man who sold me the said product. Now I was there on an important, if unoriginal, mission: to taste the best Portland has to offer, of course. However, I somehow got distracted by the cute face, the friendly smile, the lively chat, the smooth manners.

We made our way to the reception desk a little slowly as I am handicapped, stopping to ask a server what someone was eating ( a huge burger with fried bananas called the Cowfish has left the building) ; when we arrived the counter was surrounded by servers and I couldn't get in there...a waitress turned around stepping on my foot...rather hard cause I was wearing sandals...it was 12:02 by this time. I politely asked if we could be seated and the manager a goodie two shoes, Howdie Doodie type (that's much nicer than what I wrote the first time) cwho possibly remembered me from a previous visit where I had received a fairly large piece of plastic bag in the lobster salad of my\\"chef's sashimi special\\" on a previous visit and complained about it told us \\" we closed at mid-nite\\".  Now we are frequent customers albeit only when we are in town at Universal,but I have been sending people to this place for years now. I am a business owner and it happensto be a Sushi bar ( Cowfish is sushi and burgers if you are not aware ) so we share a customer base. If one of my employees slighted a customer like that and turned away business at the same time I would severely reprimand him on the spot. Now I have to chose between my pride, which was damaged by not providing the desired meal and pleasing my family who still want to go back. I lost my appetite for Cowfish last night.Epilogue: Well my wife and daughters still wanted to go back.....what can I say i am a soft touch when it comes to my family, so back we went; this time earlier needless to say. Here's how it went. We got a table fast due to preferred seating from Universal resorts so it was 20 minutes instead of 40 - 50.  When we got to our table someone else had already been seated  there,  no big deal..a few minutes later we were seated.  The waitress was pleasant, but everybody in the whole place seemed to be tuckered out. Probably they are already getting slammed with high season starting.

But in this case, it's absolutely, positivley warranted. We'd heard the stories, read the articles in Texas Monthly, and finally decided to clear our weekend so we could head to Austin for another annual BarBQuest. We got in line a few minutes after 9:00 a.m. on a misty, dreary Saturday morning, and were about 30-35 people back. That gave us plenty of time to figure our plan of attack. We did a little social networking, and just mentioning Franklin's made our phones blow up. And shortly thereafter, a young woman brought me out a chair - and then looked to the Big Guy and said, \\"I have one coming for you, too!\\" I have no idea why we were chosen - maybe some checking in? At any rate, we were thankful for the seats in a slightly drier space. At about 10:00, a young woman began taking estimates for how much food each party planned to order so they could begin estimating how many food they could order. We decided that we'd go with 2 lbs of brisket, 2 lbs of ribs (against my better judgment - if there's one meat that always lets me down, it's ribs), 1 lb of turkey, 1 lb of sausage and 1/4 lb pulled pork - you know, a pefectly reasonable amount of food for 2 people. We were also told that it'd be about 11:40 by the time the line had proceeded to when we could order.At 10:15, another young woman came through the line selling beverages - beer and soda - to help pass the time. By this point, we'd befriended the folks in front of us - it was their first time as well - and we discussed the merits of the many various bbq places in the Austin area. The Big Guy had to run in for a bio-break, and ended up talking to the legend himself - Aaron Franklin. The BG asked him how much brisket they go through in a week, and Aaron said about 5500 lbs - wow. The BG asked him why they were only open for just a couple of hours a day, and Aaron replied that they simply can't cook any more food. The BG told him how excited we were to try their food, and Aaron replied, \\"I really, really hope it lives up to your expectations.\\"Did it? Oh, hell yes.When we finally got our turn at the counter, Aaron had already been greeting guests, posing for pictures and slinging cue without skipping a beat - he was SO friendly. He continued his conversation with the Big Guy and gave us a little taste of the end of the brisket - no lie- I stopped still. It was equal parts deliciously rendered fat, meat, and seasoning. I even had a little tear form in my eye- my tongue had just experienced brisket nirvana. I'll never forget that moment. We went with the lean brisket, and then ordered everything else mentioned above. We found a couple of chairs at a larger table and just took a moment to just look at our delicious spread. And then we began - forks we of no use for us. I started with the brisket and it was amazing. It had a perfect ring of fat and smoke, and the outside of the brisket was simply divine. The entire slice was perfectly moist - better than ANY brisket I've ever had.... Snow's, Smitty's, Kreuz, City Market... They're all delicious, don't get me wrong, but this is simply amazing. And then I had the ribs. Remember how I've never been happy with ribs? Well, I'm SO glad I was overridden for 2 lbs. They were SO, SO, SO good. I can't even describe how delicious they were - the outside of the rib made me stop still. You know - that moment where your eyes roll back in your head and you don't want to chew another bite because you want that flavor to last forever? It was like that. The sausage and turkey were also stellar. The turkey was peppery, moist, and delicious. The sausage was also delicious. I'm not a fan of Lockhart sausage - it's too grainy for me - but this sausage isn't grainy at all. The skin pops when you bite into it, and has a full flavor. I'm not a pulled pork fan, but the Big Guy loved it.All told, we spent 2h 45 minutes in line and $97. Would we do it again? Absolutely. I'd do it tomorrow, and I'd bring a few friends, some chairs and a cooler full of beer. Yeah, it sucks to wait in line, but here, it's part of the experience. It was AWESOME."},{"name":"Pazzo Ristorante & Bar","address":"269 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This place is located in the heart of Boston, on one of the busiest streets, Newbury...

When i asked some questions on the wine list she couldn't answer me with a straight answer and left me in the dark for my selection. The sauce that the cod fish was served with was basically wine there was no taste to it except for warm wine. also the carbonara was too watery and tasted too much like over salted pancetta. i actually didnt even finish it all because of all the salt.

The place is fun and the art is humorous... but what stops me from giving it more than three stars is that getting a seat or even getting carry out is a total circus.  There is at most times a line to get one of a handful of tables, and if your ordering carry out it's hard to get some attention from a server or the bar.  We have two young kids so we normally just phone in an order and pick the stuff up to go (we do this at joints all over town), and it's just much more annoying that it should have to be... We don't have any trouble getting take out from Tip Top, etc. so I'd chalk most of this up to the place just being to darn small.  Also while this place could be ideal to bring kids too... it's just to packed in to make it easy enough to bring kids here who might not want to wait outside in the heat or cold to get a table.I know folks think it's fun to have a funny named hot dog place in town (and I really think Liz Lessner has done some great stuff for food in Columbus), and the food is good enough... but for me it's good it's just not amazing.... maybe I'm a bit more picky than most, maybe that comes from being from Chicago and eating at my fair share of Chicago hot dog establishments."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"7550 Highcross Blvd.","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I only get one thing when I come here, it's the petite fillet  with shrimp.

Returning to the restaurant as an alum this past weekend, I was shocked to have an exceptionally bad experience with their waitstaff.  Two friends and I came in this past Saturday afternoon (Harvard-Yale weekend) for chips, guac, and margaritas. After waiting patiently for half an hour to be seated, we were brought to a table.Ten minutes after we submitted our orders, the waitress returned to our table and explained that they felt \\"uncomfortable\\" serving us alcohol because one of my friend's \\"eyes were too red.\\"  She then accused us of smuggling alcohol into the restaurant in water bottles (we didn't), and suggested we order non-alcoholic drinks and food as an alternative. Mind you, we had been quietly waiting in the restaurant for more than half an hour before being seated, and we had already had our IDs checked and orders submitted to the kitchen. Look, we get that you have the right to refuse to serve alcohol to your customers, but if you were worried about our sobriety or well-being in any way, it would have been nice to tell us BEFORE WE WAITED for a table for half an hour.  To say that we were disruptive or unfit to be served in any capacity would have been a gross mistake, especially given that so many people around us were legitimately, rambunctiously drunk and still drinking margaritas.When it comes down to it, the restaurant is concerned about getting its liquor license revoked.

We were \\"greeted\\" by a hostess who, when we asked for a table for dinner, informed us that there was open seating in the bar.  We then asked if there was a wait for a table for 3, and she told us there was no wait, so we were seated immediately.  I was surprised that she directed us to the bar when we had asked for a table, but put it out of my mind when we were seated, though we found it rather rude to assume we'd prefer dining in the bar when we had come in for dinner.My partner presented his Jake's Club card and the waitress acknowledged it.  We ordered light fare (a salad, an appetizer, and an entree to share) and wine and it was brought in a timely manner.  We ordered a dessert as well. The food was good and plenty for the three of us, and we were presented with the check for $58.  We placed $65 cash and the club card in the payment folder, but when the waitress brought us back the receipt, there was only the receipt and club card in the folder, no change.  We were rather surprised that she would assume that the change was her tip, without giving us the opportunity to make that determination ourselves; it was a shallow tip - not even the 15% that we would have likely supplemented had we been given the chance, but we were frankly so shocked at this assumption in a fine dining establishment, particularly when dealing with a frequent diner, that we didn't leave any more.  The rudeness and snobbery of the hostess and waitress, perhaps judging us by some aberration of appearance (my partner has long hair? my daughter has tattoos?) or food choices (because we didn't order 3 entire entrees which would have been too much food for us?), left us with a foul taste in our mouths.  I doubt that I will feel welcome in this establishment again.  I'm quite disappointed as I have enjoyed Jake's food and atmosphere for many years.  I hope that Jake's will take this opportunity to educate their staff on common courtesy towards people regardless of the hosts' personal tastes, and wait-staff's expectations about gratuity, which should be earned, not assumed."},{"name":"Legends","address":"7005 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Taco Tuesday after 6pm $3 for unlimited hard shell tacos.

We read that the burger goes fast for dinner and the dinner menu explicitly states that it is subject to availability, but the brunch menu doesn't mention that. We ended up ordering the avocado toast and the pigs tails. I have definitely paid $20 for a too small portion before and been completely fine with it because of how amazing the food was.

Because they are really that good.  We couldn't stop exclaiming about the ribs, the brisket and the pulled pork.  The turkey was very moist and wonderful, but didn't thrill us the way the other meats did.  We also found that no one in our party of five was fighting to get the last piece of sausage.  We also consumed all of the potato salad and cole slaw that we ordered.  They were also very good, and in another setting I might have had more praise for them, but they were just the back-up singers to the star meats of the BBQ show.I started my wait in line about 7:10 am on a Sunday morning.  Another car pulled into the parking lot as I arrived, and we were the first ones in line that day.  My motivation for waiting 4 hours for BBQ were my friends from out of state who were excited to go to Rudy's.  I was thrilled when I found out that they had meetings on Sunday morning, so I wouldn't have to miss time with them while I waited in line to show them how much better than Rudy's BBQ could be.  I brought a chair with me, and plenty of things to read on a fully charged iphone. I found that I didn't get as much reading done as I thought I would due to all the time spent communicating and coordinating with friends who would join me just before the the doors opened at 11.  I also enjoyed conversation with my newly found line friends as we were all excited to be on the verge on having the best BBQ in the universe.  As much as I enjoyed my 4 hour wait in line, I've already placed my pre-order for 5 lbs of BBQ for the first weekend in October when we'll have more out-of-state visitors.  If you want to skip the line you'll need to go to the Franklin BBQ website, find the calendar and check to see whether or not they are sold out. on the day you want BBQ.  If they are not sold out - you can email in a minimum order quantity of 5 lbs of any combination of meet.  On the day you specified you pick up your pre-ordered BBQ between 10:15 and 10:35 am.  If you miss this window, you forfeit your pre-order.While it takes patience to get a taste of Aaron Franklin's masterwork BBQ, the time and effort spent to get just makes it taste better."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Not much to say besides this is some of my favorite Indian food.

It has great smoke flavor though. The smoked chicken here is consistently good. It is heavily seasoned with this delicious powder and smoked for good measure. Do not skip the skin! Even if you are a fu fu health person, the skin is still for you  (the majority of the fat may have been rendered off by the smoking process).The sides here are pretty decent. My favorite is the brunswick stew and the backed beans. And one last note, DO NOT SKIP DESSERT. The banana pudding here is ungodly delicious.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fox Bros is the consensus place for best BBQ in Atlanta. My most recent trip -- of many -- did nothing to dissuade that opinion.A couple of months ago, there was a heavy storm that took down a tree right by the restaurant. As a result, they had a tarp that folks used to eat under. After the renovation, the restaurant has a lot more light and ambiance outside. (The inside Olde Smith feel still exists by the bar.) But the outside area is much improved. That said, folks don't come to BBQ places for the ambiance or chairs, they come for the 'Cue. Fox Bros does it well. I normally get a half dark chicken or beef brisket sandwiches. The chicken is tender and moist with a sauce that's both sweet and appropriately acidic. The brisket, in my opinion, is the best in Atlanta. It's tender and flavorful.The servers are very knowledgeable and always friendly. The only downside, to the extent this place has one, is that the bar is not great. I have yet to find an appropriate alcoholic drink. (The margaritas are OK and not really BBQ accompaniments in my opinion.) Also, the lines can be extremely long whenever tourists are in town. (Hotel concierges send folks to Fox Bros. in droves.)

I've been a few times for quick lunch or dinner meetings and while I've never left feeling super disappointed, I've never been impressed; the food is pretty standard in terms of flavor and quality.

The large margaritas are good for sharing between 2-4 people.  If you can grab a table in the bar area (weeknights are less crowded), you can take advantage of their tapas menu - about 10 different tapas (empanadas, tuna ceviche, calimari, etc) for a buck each.  Great for a snack with their (strong) drinks or a smallish meal.Dining Room (3 of 5): The first few times for a meal were great, but my more recent visits have been merely ok - mainly due to inattentive service.  Southwestern sauces and flavors are right up my alley, so definitely check it out if you're into that sort of thing.  I think the menu is good, but no real surprises (e.g., the rare ahi tuna steak is well-executed, but not really a differentiator in the neighborhood).  Also a good place for weekend brunch.Overall, it is a good change of pace from the french and new american places that dominate the south end.

They're crumbly and sweet and didn't even need to cinnamon butter and pimento cheese that accompanied them though that was a nice addition. The menu is designed for sharing and they course the meal out which is great in theory but  after our first dish arrived we waited over 1/2 an hour before anything else came out and watched food was delivered to other tables. Then after about 45 minutes the rest all came at once which was a little annoying and our waiter never checked in with us and forgot the iced tea we ordered. Overall though it was excellent food and I'll be back but it'd be great if they worked out some of those kinks. A true unexpected highlight was the complimentary tarot card reading in the accompanying lounge. It was my first ever and the woman was excellent - I just wish I'd picked up her card!Highlights: honey glazed biscuits & sliders, chicken & waffles was good but not our favorite thing ordered.

Although so many were ahead of us, they didn't run out of anything by the time we ordered at 12:45pm. However, I noticed the line stopped forming by 9:00am. An employee comes and asked what we were ordering so she can tell people at the end of the line if they will still have food left. Although it is a long time to wait, it goes quickly. Bring chairs (some are available under the steps), a cooler, and an umbrella for shade. I brought a book, but had so much fun meeting new friends in line I never even opened it. Some groups were playing games. It is like a tailgate party with the beer drinking and all. The service is outstanding. It is very welcoming. The brisket is the best brisket hands down. It was moist and so flavorful. The turkey was amazing! The ribs were a wet/ dry mix. I thought they were a little fatty. Sausage was more like a spiced bologna.

I had the grilled salmon sandwich. The salmon was (surprise, surprise) overcooked, but the flavors tied with it were great. Thin sliced of cooked potatoes, spinach and dill yogurt. It all ties together pretty well.For those looking for a liquor based drink, there is no cocktail menu, though they have a full bar, and are willing to make you drinks on request.

I'd better weigh in so everyone has the benefit of my expert analysis!I've been one time. Or rather, picked up an order one time (I don't do lines). Here's the quick and dirty:Brisket: We must have gotten the lean brisket. No discernable smoke ring. Probably as good as any other brisket in town (though I haven't tried Macklemore or whatever it's called yet. Nor have I tried Stiles Switch). John Mueller's brisket may be superior, in fact. Kreuz Market and Smitty's down in Lockhart are superior. And Snow's over in Lexington is DEFINITELY superior. Sausage: I don't order this at barbecue places. Do you go to Ruth's Chris and get a Slim Jim?Turkey: Probably not even as good as Bill Miller. In fact, the leftovers were nearly inedible the next day. Tough and dry.Pork ribs: Fantastic. Lots of pepper.Pork shoulder: Easily the best pork I've had in Texas. Absolutely sublime. It's not on the menu, so maybe this is just something you can get with call-ahead orders. Espresso BBQ sauce: Possibly the greatest barbecue sauce I've ever had. I am going to be buying a LOT of this stuff and putting it on everything.Sides: Who the fuck has time for sides?All in all, a solid 3.5 stars. I can't wait to try the pulled pork (the gold standard of barbecue back in Memphis, where barbecue is a way of life and not a topic for hipster chest-thumping).

Once for dinner which was very good but very loud and very tightly packed. However the food was good enough that we wanted to try breakfast as well. At breakfast we were seated on the patio which is quieter and beautiful. \\nThe food is very New Orleans like  I had a ribeye for dinner that was cooked perfectly and had one of the best gravy's I've ever tasted with it.  My wife had there burger which is huge and fantastic although very messy. Get extra napkins. The dinner I would give 5 stars for the food and two for the ambiance. Breakfast was the sausage poor boy sandwich for me and the huevos rancheros for my wife.  The sandwich was very dry just hot links cheese eggs and fried onion strings on a very good roll. The grits that came on the side were flavored with cheese and while it tasted good it wasn't what I expect in my grits. My wife's was served in a bowl and tasted great although it had an unexpected sweet bbq taste to the brisket in it and was a bit strong on the spices.  We also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy which we both tried and both thought while good were over seasoned as well.

Probably the best veggie pizza I have ever had. Sun dried tomatoes, spinach, artichoke, mozzarella and feta cheese on a crust that had a garlic and olive oil base. This pizza was tasty and did not feel \\"heavy\\" at all. Just a great combination of flavors.My hubby had a small ceasar salad with chicken, not to much chicken but good dressing. I had a side salad with spicy ranch dressing. The dressing packed a punch, I was surprised at how spicy it was but it had a great flavor.We had Michelob Ultras, they were $4 a piece.The only downside was that the meal was expensive, worth every penny though. For a large Mighty Meaty, Small White Rabbit, 4 beers, 1 side salad and 1 small chicken caesar salad the bill was $60.00.

I liked the chopped parsley garnish on the fries, nice touch.  I got a mug of Sam Adams and my boyfriend got Bud - which they don't have on tap so he got a bottle, and we got a $4. side of onion rings, also good.Well, it turns out that the sign is misleading.  What it actually means is that for $6. you get a burger and if you BRING YOUR OWN 40 OZ MUG, they will fill it for the price of a 20 oz mug!!   HUH?????  That definitely needs to be cleared up as it is false advertising.  Our waitress, however, was excellent and gave us a credit on the bill to reflect the advertised price.

Yes, Indian food--in America, at least--utilizes a lot of pressed seeds, but the amount here seemed a little excessive.Maybe it was what I ordered. A buddy and I split the saag paneer--cheese and Indian creamed spinach, as I look to call it. With a lower temperature than I would have liked, the dish fell a little flat. As well, the naan bread yielded soggy texture. With both items erring on the lukewarm end I think the man in charge would do well to heat his food up a little better. I understand that many food trucks use microwaves, but not evening out the heat creates a presumption of lack of freshness.On the whole, not bad offerings for Indian food out of a mobile eatery.

We were all looking forward to our brunch because we love going out to eat and there were some great reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, our experience sucked so I don't think we'll be giving it another whirl. We made reservations and were promptly seated. As soon as we left the hostess area for our table (a high booth alongside the bar), we could feel the air getting uncomfortably warm and heavy. As the hostess was settling us in, I grabbed a menu to fan myself. I wasn't being a drama queen - it really was that warm. I asked the hostess if she could please turn the air conditioner up a notch. She said she would but nothing happened because it remained over 80¬∞. With three of us now using the menus as fans (yes, we did ask to keep them for that purpose), and my in-laws actually sweating, we told our waitress that we were really uncomfortable and needed the AC turned on/up. She acknowledged that the restaurant does indeed get warm but apparently left it at that because it never got any cooler.As for the food, it's pretentious and mediocre at best. They also use a lot of salt. We started off with the crumpets with jam and cream. 2 grilled (and salty) crumpets with a tiny bit of cream and jam. Good but nothing to write home about. We also had a side of cheesy smoked grits. It was the one bright spot in our shitty experience, so I happily recommend this side dish. For mains, my in-laws and I had the secret (and salty) burger which lists \\"your faith\\" as one of the \\"ingredients\\" so I asked what that was. The waitress said there were no secret ingredients in the burger. The secret was in how they chopped the beef and that was what \\"your faith\\" referred to (Oh please). The secret burger is nothing special at all - some shredded lettuce, one or two thin pickle slices, onion and some Russian-like dressing. The homemade potato chips it comes with were pretty good though. My husband had the biscuits and sausage gravy. He was expecting a more traditional sausage flavor and couldn't put his finger on the alternative flavor they'd concocted instead. The bill came to over $150 (with tip) for 2 sides, 3 burgers, the biscuits & gravy, 4 coffees, and two cocktails. This would have been fine if the food had been worth it and we hadn't been sweating our butts off the entire time.  There are many positive reviews of this restaurant on Yelp and elsewhere so perhaps my experience was out of the ordinary and they were just having an off day. I'll never know because I won't be going back. On a positive note, I like the d√©cor and the place has potential. My specific feedback for management would be to read through the negative reviews that are out there in cyberspace (there are some definite patterns!), regulate the temperature, chill out with the salt and taste the food before you send it out."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Items Selected:\\nGracenote Coffee Roasters Coffee\\nPickled Corn Pancakes - Strawberries, Buttermilk, Crema, Mint\\nCinnamon Roll with Maple Icing\\nBlack & Blueberry Buckle with Cr√®me Fraiche\\nCroissant Pain Perdu - Cherry Preserves, White Chocolate, Almond Butter\\nHickory Smoked Pigs' Tails - Maple Glazed, Soft Poached Egg, Cheese Crisps, GritsPresent on several Best New Restaurant lists both local and nationwide, Cambridge's Alden & Harlow was selected for Saturday brunch largely based on a menu that seems to fly in the face of conformity almost for the sake of proving that the \\"New American\\" movement need not be so stagnant, the concept at times hitting a homerun by way of experimentation while other compositions seem to be trying too hard to be creative.Located at 40 Brattle Street, an underground space that expands much further than one would guess from the exterior, Alden & Harlow opened in 2014 and under the toque of Chef Michael Scelfo has gained critical acclaim almost from the beginning by taking a modern approach to locally sourced ingredients while also featuring one of the most innovated Bar programs in the area by barrel aging several options while also offering a good mix of novelties as well as the classics.Best described as shabby chic in design, several odd references to Drugs perhaps lost on those unfamiliar with the area or space, it was just after the 10:30am opening that seats were offered at a far back banquet, the music overhead taking the now-trendy route of channeling classics from the 50s and 60s while the menu presented was anything but expected, the five items ordered all delivered almost simultaneously in a matter of moments.Locally sourcing as much as possible, Coffee from Gracenote refilled repeatedly by a server who was not particularly in-tune with the menu, though efficient and pleasant enough, dining at Alden & Harlow began with fluffy Cornmeal Pancakes lightly tinged in acid and Buttermilk atop a lightly sweetened Cream plus Strawberries, the follow-up Buckle taking a similar route in terms of flavor profile as bursting Berries densely pocketed piping-hot cast iron with a stiff dollop of Cr√®me Fraiche slowly melting down into a buttery Streusel top.Intentionally veering sweet, though savory selections also beckon, further tastes entailed a crisp yet flexible curl of Cinnamon Brioche sitting in a pool of caramelized Butter beneath a mountain of Maple Icing, the 'Pain Perdu' unfortunately falling short in the flavor department by eschewing any sort of sweetness in the custard while Hickory smoked Pigs' Tails actually proved to be the highlight of the morning with the shredded meat fully imbuing the grits with smoke and sweetness and a stick-to-the-ribs richness fortified by the poached Egg."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"There's a reason why they have so many reviews...and a reason why most of them are 4-5 stars.

Azteca restaurants.Here's the thing: The portions are huge, but the lunch menu is just right. I just had Steak Fajitas for $9.95 with rice and beans, guac, sour cream, pico, salsa, chips, tortillas, steak, grilled onions and peppers. That is an amazing deal!The staff are friendly and speak both English and Spanish fluently (at least most of them do).

I am as cheap as skates come, so I consciously ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, to which the waiter observed, \\"I guess if you're ONLY going to order one dish, the pork chops are the thing to order. It's a huge serving.\\" Whatever man. Your tip just dropped from 30% to 20%. Keep it up: let's see how low we can go!!They brought me two pork chops, and one of them was twice as thick as the other. I ate the thin one first, figuring that I'd save the epic one for last. The first one was cooked perfectly. And the second one was basically raw meat in the middle. I ate it anyway because I'm a pacifist, but the experience left me questioning whether or not I'll ever go back, and as fate would have it, my own personal rating system gives a place four stars if I would go back, and three or lower if I wouldn't.As it currently stands, I can't make up my mind about this place. The odds are good that I won't go back in real life because I don't like to spend a lot of money on food, but the question is: would I go back if I were in a simulation where only the value per dollar matters, and the number of dollars in my pocket wouldn't because it's all happening inside of a computer anyway? (Sorry, I've been watching too much Black Mirror recently.) I really don't know. If I were to come back, I would spend half of my meal day-dreaming about kicking the waiter in the shins, but that's normal, and I'm a big enough person that I'm not going to hold it against the place. But that second pork chop... is it a deal killer?Look, the bottom line is that this outcome is completely avoidable. And one would think that a western bistro would know how to cook meat without me explaining to them that cook time depends on the thickness of the cut. I want to like this place. I really do. It was recommended by a friend, and it made me feel like I have more money than I do, especially after I started eavesdropping on the conversation at the table next to me. But I think, on balance, the one pork chop is enough to seal your fate."},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Tonight I received great service from the wait staff Chloe but the chef's preparation of the pasta dish left me disappointed with my choice for dinner.

The belly dancer put on a great show and was the best part of the restaurant experience.  My husband asked for a beer menu and the waitress said the available beers always change so there is no written menu...needless to say she had to go back to the bar to see what was available.  It later appeared the same goes for dessert ....when we asked for the menu we were told there were only two options: baklava which is homemade and a chocolate mousse which they purchase ready made.  For an appetizer, we got the Meze platter for four was wonderfully plated and delicious...plenty of pita bread too.  The men got the lamb kabob...my husband said it was ok...nothing of note.  My friend's wife and I got the Sempoog (eggplant veggie dish) and the salmon and we split them.  The veggie dish was ok as a whole (the roasted eggplant was delicious)but the tomato sauce seemed raw tasting to me.  The side veggies that come with the entrees are stewed in a tomato sauce which I think tasted good however, it appeared that the 'raw' sauce was added on top of the veggies.  The salmon was ok too...moist and cooked through for the most part but I tasted one bite that was not fully cooked.  I couldn't spit it out so I crossed my fingers hoping I wouldn't get sick from it.  The side rice pilaf was too dry.For dessert, the waitress suggested a plate for the four of us with both options.  So we got four pieces of baklava and four pieces cake which were about the same size as the baklava (e.g. standard diamond shape pieces).  The baklava was only flaky at the top.... the bottom was dense and dry.  I asked for decaf coffee but was not sure if I got it since it appeared so black and strong in the coffee cup. I had a hard time getting the waitress back to ask so I didn't have any of it.We didn't discuss how our friends enjoyed the food since even after the belly dancing show was over, the band's volume remained unnecessarily high.  It was extremely difficult to have any conversation and actually very annoying.  When we left we had to have a little pow-wow at the front door to sort of \\"catch up\\" and re-group for the night.  We all agreed that next time we'll go to a place where we can have enjoyable conversation throughout the night!The waitstaff was friendly and varied....by that I mean we never had one consistent waitress...whomever happened to walk by took drink orders and food orders.

The dynamic duo burger was cooked exactly how we ordered it, everything paired well and the sweet potato fries were crispy but not over done. As for the spicy tuna roll, just your average roll nothing really stood out about it.For dessert we knew we wanted to share a milkshake but the choices made it hard to narrow it down to one.

To my disappointment, the majority of my meat had fat on it when it came out. I was in a bit of a hurry so I wasn't trying to send it back, but I did mention it to the server after I trimmed the fat off myself and ate what lean meat was left. I'm not sure if it was the owner or a manager,however he was VERY professional about the mistake and brought some brisket out with all the fat trimmed off after he heard about the mistake. This was the icing on top for me; the brisket was phenomenal and the service was impeccable.

The menu is enthralling... I found my mind swirling with each description, wondering to myself how I was going to make a coherent decision. Ultimately, I decided to reign in my desire to make the \\"one of everything, please\\" order, and went much smaller in scale than originally planned, in hopes to visit again soon to sample more.Before getting into specific reviews, one common theme emerged throughout the night. The menu is very, very ambitiously creative, but it seemed to fall just ever slightly short with every dish. While we completely enjoyed everything we tasted, there wasn't that clear \\"wow\\" moment that I always hope for. You know, that moment you look at your dining partner and roll your eyes in wonderment. First to arrive was our snack, the broiled Island Creek oysters. Good, but overall, fairly average in flavor. Nothing much more to say here.Second, was the carpaccio. I'm a freak for any carpaccio and order it from almost every menu in which I encounter it, so I like to think I know a good carpaccio. A&H's carpaccio was good, but had too much going on. It seemed to suffer from the same influences that are harming sushi in this country... Too many flavors further complicated and/or muted by globs of creamy sauces. Razor thin beef is a beautiful thing, and shouldn't need a pile of accoutrement to enhance it. Let those basic flavors shine and speak for themselves. It was a gorgeous dish, I just wish the flavors had matched.Third were the farm corn pancakes. Perfectly cooked, fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. Again, somewhat underwhelming in flavor, and seemed to be lacking texture. They were served alongside fried shishito peppers that could've benefitted from a bit more time in the fryer to produce more blistering instead of being mostly soggy. The popcorn sprinkled on top was a whimsical addition, but I failed to see how it added anything to the dish. It almost felt like a Chopped episode of random ingredients that were force together (in a good way, almost), and I found myself eating the popcorn after the fact. Besides, popcorn doesn't fork well. If the flavors and seasonings could be refined, and the insane creativity of the menu reigned in to make something a bit more unified and coherent, Alden & Harlow would easily be a top Boston area destination for years to come."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"5 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I wish this existed in San Francisco.

We came for the brisket and that is all we orderd, pounds of brisket.  It is the best I have ever eaten, excellent bark, simple salt and pepper flavors, great smoke ring, and perfectly tender.  It is rare you find a bbq place that can balance the tenderness of the flat and point of the brisket, and they nail it every time.  One comment about their model.  They started as a bbq trailer and expanded into a restaurant, and still run it like a trailer.  They have ONE man cutting the meat.  ONE man.  That is why you are waiting 3-4 hours.

Unfortunately.... I was there with a group of friends to eat. So the food for the most part was good. The service was very hit and miss. I liked the girl, but she just was never around. They brought out one bread basket for 6 people. We asked for an additional basket and she pointed out there there were two whole loaves of bread in the one she brought us. We were perfectly capable of seeing the bread in the basket. When we asked again, she said she would be right back with the bread. 10 minutes later I had to go ask someone else for the bread. Now, I ordered a Kobe Burger at a whopping $12.00. I ordered it med-rare. It came out well done. I had to wait for about 15 minutes (while everyone else ate) to get my order fixed. Needless to say, by the time they actually got me my dinner, it was in a to go box. No one seemed really over the top with the food. Not to say it was not good, meaning edible, but I don't think anyone will be returning just for the food and the service. Maybe the bar. So in my opinion, if you want to sit and chat with someone, don't want to be disturbed by those pesky waitstaff, don't need your food to be done right the first time and done mind watching the ice melt in your empty glass, this is the place to be.

When we got there (about 6 on a Saturday night), there was already a line outside of about 10 people. We took that as a very good sign. We probably waited about 30 minutes to be seated -- the process of getting people in and out was efficient and the staff very courteous.The place is small inside. The decor is minimalist, with mostly big long tables where you share space with others -- not a problem. Your order at the counter from a chalkboard menu. Any questions are answered knowledgeably. We ordered the tonkatsu ramen with the extra goodies of our choices. it took about 5 minutes for us to get our food. Oh myyyyy! The broth is like velvet in your mouth. A gentle wave of taste layers that wash over your tongue and make you feel as if you've either had a rapturous interlude, or you're back in the womb, all cozy and warm. The noodles were tender, the pork full of flavor, the egg enhancing, and, gosh darn it, everything else is just a delicious blur.Since our visit there, we traveled to New York City and ate in a Zagat-rated ramen restaurant in Hell's Kitchen.

Their dim sum is decent. This review is more on the bad experience I have with their communication skill. Before I write the experience though, I do want to mention that I am also native Mandarin speaker and English is my second languge.Last night, my friend and I had the urge of getting dim sum for dinner. For my exeprience, I know dim sum is usually servered during the day but I never try to go during the night. To be sure, I called the restaurant to confirm. The conversation went like this.Me: Do you serve dim sum in the night ? ( it was about 2PM when I called )\\nHLM: Yes, right now.\\n( Not sure if the person on the phone really know what I meant )\\nMe: No, I mean, later tonight. Do you serve dim sum in the night time ?\\nHLM: Yes.\\n( I sensed that she might still not knowing what I meant )\\nMe: So, I can get dim sum like in the afternoon around 6 PM ?\\nHLM: Yes.\\nMe : Thank you ( I hang up )After talking to my friend , he said its better to call and try to confirm it in Mandarin. I did and got the same answer. We decided it should be good enough confirmation that do server dim sum in the night time.We arrived in the restaurant and the host gave us two regular menu. I asked him \\"Do you have menu for dim sum?\\" He said \\"Yes\\" and came back with a menu with about 30 items on it. Limited selection but still better than nothing, we thought. Little do we know when the waiter came to take order. Most of the items on the menu are not available. \\"Only steamed one can order\\" He said to me. I managed to pick 8 items off the menu. It took about 10 mins to get our soup order and another 15 mins for the dim sum to get to the table. At the same time, the waiter just stands around chatting away. We asked for water at the beginning and we had to asked again around the end of the meal for him to bring out the water. If you want to visit this place, go during the day time. The experience is ok during day time, not worth the money in the night."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Christopher's reminds me of a Facebook friend from high school who gets in touch out of the blue. I go there about every two years, and am really psyched about it at first, then I suddenly remember why it's been a few years since we've been in touch.To set the scene, I loved going here when I was a kid. I was less picky and couldn't have a beer back then. In those days there was a Ground Round on Mass. Ave., which my parents inexplicably hated taking to me despite the fact that there was free popcorn, Ms. Pacman, lots of screaming kids running around, a drunken surly Binky the clown, and a constant projection reel of the Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy. Anyhow, Christopher's was like a grown up version of that, and my mother actually liked taking me there from time to time. It was a really big treat, but over the years the thrill has waned.On our last trip, the hostess showed up at the front podium four or five minutes after we arrived even though the place was half empty, led us to a table, then started cleaning the table right behind ours so we had to wait for her to finish before we sat. Wha?? She gave us too few menus and no specials/rotating taps list. I know it's not necessarily the job of a hostess to take an initial drink order, but given how slow the service continued to be, it would have been nice perk--and would have helped make the tip much closer to 20% than it ended up being.The menu was half brunch, which meant that our 2:00 lunch selections were fairly limited, so I got a burger. It was pretty good, though overcooked (not to order). The fries were tasty, but they continued to be tastED for several hours. Why is your cooking oil still too cold at 2:00 p.m.?I remember being impressed by the beer selection in the past too. But today, almost all of the rotating taps seemed really inappropriate for the season and the weather. I had the impression the breweries were giving them deals to use up the leftover winter stock. With a few exceptions, the list was full of porter, barleywine, a quadruple, a stout, imperial IPA... Chris, dude, it's hot and muggy out--I need some lighter, more poundable options today.Anyhow, I'm sure I'll be back in another two years, though I'm not hopeful about updating my review at that time."},{"name":"No Mas!

We were both craving BBQ and thought I'd give them a shot since we were in the area and there happened to be an open parking spot. Without a long story I'll say I wasn't particularly impressed. It was quiet inside and we had a friendly attentive waitress, but the food was a let down for reasons beyond taste. Out of all the BBQ places I've been to in Massachusetts this place has by far the smallest portion sizes I've seen. I found it amusing that a skinny guy like myself who doesn't eat too much ordered a \\"two selection\\" entree and an appetizer and was still quite hungry afterward. One little ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes, two little pieces of fish, and a piece of white bread with a small amount of (evenly spread) pulled chicken on top did not impress me.The food tasted fine, but is not what I would consider great BBQ. It wasn't bad or dry, but it wasn't very special and it lacked plavor. If the food isn't that great you had better not be stingy with it. On a side note: the beer selection was pretty boring and out of touch, but I won't penalize a BBQ place for that. Although, it would certainly add points to my opinion if they made an attempt. If an ultra casual tablecloth place like Redbones can offer decent beer the rest of you restaurants have no excuse.I've been to the Village Smokehouse, Redbones and Blue Ribbon and this place ranks well behind them. 3 stars for a nice waitress, and quick delivery of food, but I don't think I'll be back unless someone invites me.

While I agree that the bottom-linen is the achievement of tender, lean, smoked meat, I feel that the differences in technique and mastery found in varying barbecue establishments are what makes one place better than the other.*That being said the ribs were pleasantly tender and lean with just the right amount of sweet BBQ sauce.  Pulled pork was almost too sweet/salty in addition to the sauce, and the chicken was surprisingly tender.  Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had at a BBQ shack - extremely creamy and extra cheesy.  The sweet potato pie was excellent, but the pecan pie was too sweet with not enough nuts.  All this for a great price.Bare bones eatery with a small yet well-made menu. Seating both inside and outside, but no guarantee that the awning over the outdoor seating completely covers you.  Plenty of (un)sweetened tea available.  Staff was friendly and attentive - a busboy was nice enough to recommend a fried chicken place just down the street.

It had some flavor, but didn't come with enough is my impression. Other than that, the pork was amazing. It was soft, most and cooked perfectly. The brisket was good, my only complaint would be it was all ground up. It was almost like eating finely ground meat to where it was a little challenge to eat. The ribs were REALLY good. There was a nice amount of meat on them and was easy to tear off. The tots were crisp, mac + cheese creamy like mary mac's.

We normally get there maybe at 7:50 AM, and the wait is usually under 2 hours with 1.5 being the norm.

After reading reviews and seeing Thrillist's \\"Top 25\\" article I was excited to see what all the hype was about.  My excitement lasted about 5 minutes after walking in the door.  The decor is great and the atmosphere was nice.  The service on the other hand left much to be desired. Our waiter didn't appear to be too happy to be there and was short and snippy.  We were also not thanked or acknowledged on the way out the door.  I ordered the Darkest Night cocktail to begin.  One of the listed ingredients was vanilla and I believe it was an apt description for the entire drink.  Very boring.The corn pancakes were, by themselves, delicious.  I completely did not understand the peppers and they did nothing for the dish. In fact, they just tasted bad.  The popcorn was maybe creative in theory but simply didn't work.  I spent the majority of the time trying to avoid breaking my tooth on a kernel.  All this was after trying to figure out how to even get the popcorn from the plate to my mouth.  Have you ever eaten popcorn at home with a fork?  There's a reason for that.The crispy pork belly with grits was the best dish but still missed the mark.  The dish was fatty, naturally, given the nature of pork belly, but the dish lacked any real acid to break up the mouth full of fat.  The grits, however, were fantastic.  I would have been happy with nothing else besides a plate full of those southern gift to the world.The New York strip steak with bone marrow was executed poorly.  I appreciate the attempt to brown the meat while leaving the interior a nice medium rare.  Biting into this steak, however, was like getting your mouth washed out with a piece of charcoal. Maybe a few minutes less on the char. The dessert of bread pudding and sea salt ice cream would have been great if there would have been no bread pudding.  As one other reviewer noted, \\"gluey\\" is about the only adjective I can think of to describe it.  It was left uneaten on the table which is the first time I have ever been able to say that.

We redeemed it on Memorial Day and had a good experience.  I had a medium dark roast coffee; nothing too exciting but not bad either. My wife had a soy chai tea latte that she is still raving about. We both got sandwiches too, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Everyone was nice enough, service was quick.  I like the layout: exposed brick and wood paneling gives the place a little bit of charm. Plenty of room to sit and abundant Wi-Fi as well.They had two waste bins near their free water dispenser. One for recycle and one for trash.  But I think if they want people to respect the recycling bin, they need to label it at eye level or something, because it was full of trash and the sign was about 3-4 inches from the ground.  Not that this has any bearing on the business, but maybe someone on staff will read this and fix it.We live in Dorchester, which is a coffee shop desert; we only have Flat Black, which we love, but their hours leave a lot to be desired.

Boy were we glad we made the switch! The staff was very pleasant and we were seated immediately. Our server, Leslie, was fantastic as she attended to everything with a great attitude and a smile. She promptly took our orders and checked on us throughout dinner. She even took time to have some brief conversation with us as well.As for the meals, they were unbelievable! Each of our steaks were cooked to perfection and probably some of the best we have ever tasted. My daughter also got a lobster tail and half rack of ribs with her filet. The lobster was wonderful and the ribs were fall off the bone delicious. All of which was only about a $35 meal. My prime rib and my wifes ribeye were cooked exactly as we requested and were some of the most flavorful, tender cuts of meat we have ever had. The portions were huge and my wife and I had plenty to take with us as we were not able to finish. We did however, all order dessert to go and that was to die for as well! The chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice cream was fantastic. There was also another chocolate cake dessert for 2 that my wife and I shared and that is a must order for any chocolate lover because it was unbelievable!The prices were very reasonable, especially considering that this is a steakhouse. This was my wife and daughter's first time at Longhorn and they were so happy we went. The food and service are 1st rate and this is a definite place to eat if you're in the area!

We shared the ahi tuna appetizer and the crab rangoon dip- the crab rangoon dip in particular was really tasty. We were seated right away and our initial drink and appetizer order was taken pretty quickly which set a nice tone for the evening we thought. We received our drinks and our appetizers really soon after that, which was great- unfortunately the service went downhill a bit after this. After we finally placed our entree orders, we waited for at least a half hour for it to come out- I finally had to ask our server to bring my 3 year old daughter's kids meal out as soon as it was ready since she was starving and that seemed to remind him (or the kitchen?) that we needed our food, which resulted in all of our food coming out together shortly after that.\\nThat being said, I thoroughly enjoyed my black and bleu burger (substituted a housemade veggie patty which was really flavorful- YAY). This was a creative burger with blackberries, brie, honey and saki marinated pears. DELICIOUS. I think I may have ordered the best meal though. My father enjoyed his burger/sushi bbq pork roll but my brother did not enjoy his filet sushi/burger fusion roll. My sister in law and sister both ordered their bento boxes which gave you a lot of items (bang for your buck) but I think they both wish the slider had been more substantial or that they had just ordered a burger.\\nThe food here is pretty good, the prices are decent for the portions given the fact that it's on Universal's city walk, but the service definitely needed improvement- it wasn't THAT terribly busy and we never got refills on our drinks, or really even checked on, except at the very end when the waiter offered us to go drinks with our check.

You can add bacon too for $1.  Their fries are really good; they've got that extra crisp to them without being crunchy.  I think their fries come second to In-N-Out's fries, in terms of fast-food places.  Prices are really good, as your meal (without tip) usually ends up being just under $10.  The restaurant itself has a fun atmosphere to it.  The service is usually on the slower side.  They also have a pool table.

If i wanted lean meat, I wouldn't be ordering a nice, big, juicy steak. The tiramisu just melts in your mouth. I've had others that just felt like regular coffee-chocolate flavored cake.

Talk about prime real estate for Christopher's!  It was practically the first thing we saw!  Right off of a major intersection with high visibility, plenty of parking and right off the T.  No wonder this place has so many reviews!  If you can't find it, it's because your leader dog is lying to you about his reading abilities.Once we stepped inside we were greeted by a hostess who took us upstairs before we even had a chance to check the place out.  I got the sense that she was fed up with people requesting where they wanted to sit and was determined to put us where she wanted us to sit.  I gotta give the girl props for getting down to business. Upstairs was pretty quiet- a regular dining room with carpeted floors, wood accents, and small moveable wooden tables and chairs.  There were only two other tables with guests in the room, so there wasn't much competition for the server's attention.We opened the menu to find a fairly standard American menu with plenty of options for different tastes.  Within minutes our server was at the table with waters ready to take our drink order.  For a starter, I couldn't decide between starting with the Spinach Artichoke Dip or the Veggie Chili Nachos and the server suggested that if I wanted the appetizer to come out sooner rather than later, the Veggie Chili Nachos would be the quicker choice, as the Spin Art dip was going to take about 20 minutes.  20 minutes for dip?  Are they milking the cows and cutting the greens from the garden!?!  Obviously I couldn't wait that long so I went with the veggie chili nachos.    Bonus points to the server for mentioning the wait time and now my curiosity is piqued to go back and try this Spin Art dip that takes so long to prepare.After a few sips of my lemonade, I notice this isn't just any lemonade that gets pumped out of a soda gun, it's like fresh lemonade, with maybe even a touch of grapefruit or lime in it?  Whatever it was, it was some of the best damn lemonade I've had from a restaurant in a long time!The veggie chili nachos were great.  Don't let the name scare you- you won't be scarfing down tofu, just hearty vegetables in a rich chili sauce over homemade chips.  The chips were a little too done for my tastes, but it didn't stop me from devouring them to get every last bit of the tasty chili off the plate.When the burger section of the menu is labeled \\"Burgahs\\"- you know they aren't messin' around.  (Of course, this only makes sense if you know the deep Boston accent.)  The homemade veggie burger was highlighted on the menu as one of the best veggie burgers in Boston, so I decided to give it a try... to which my husband asked, \\"what's up with ordering vegetarian today?\\"  Can't a girl order something that's vegetarian friendly without actually BEING a vegetarian?!  *GOSH!*Our food arrived pretty quickly and after a few bites of my veggie burger, I kinda wish I hadn't trusted those reviewers.  I was expecting a veggie burgers that had the same juicy texture as a regular burger, just made with something other than meat... ala Bocca burgers.  What I got was a squashed ball of veggies and beans with no distinct flavor other than the pesto and roasted red pepper on top.  The patty itself kept falling apart and into my lap, making me feel like a three year old who can't keep a burger together, and the large french roll bun just added to the dry texture and lack of overall flavor.  I determined that no amount of ketchup was going to make up for the overall texture and lack of taste.  I looked over at my husband's Roquefort Burger which he was devouring like it was his last meal and kept my jealousy to myself to avoid the mocking I would have suffered for my vegetarian choice in \\"Burgah\\".  Perhaps a true vegetarian would have appreciated the culinary mastery of the items that were combined into this veggie filled patty, but Anne-the-Omnivore craved something more, well.. meat-like.  Shame on me.Overall, this is a great place.  Its large menu, full bar, and proximity to shopping and transportation make it a great destination for an afternoon lunch or evening out.  I wouldn't mind going back... and I really want to know what they put in the lemonade!"},{"name":"B√°nh M√¨ Tr√®s Bon","address":"1840-4720 McClelland Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Decided to try this new place last night.

That said, in Boston I will take what I can get, and when I'm homesick and queso-starved, Border Cafe is better than nothing.They always seem to be super crowded and to have a long wait, and honestly everything about it reminds me of Dallas-style Tex-Mex, which is to say bland, bland, and bland. The margarita was terrible- watery, bland, weak- and the salsa was only marginal after dumping in a substantial amount of hot sauce (of the Louisiana variety, resulting in an interesting but not altogether unpleasant flavor composition...). As people have mentioned, the chips are free, plentiful, and tasty.The service was fairly uneven, but the space is gigantic and crowded. If you aren't in the mood for eating amongst a din, I would recommend trying to sit downstairs were there are fewer tables and lower ceilings.If you've never actually had Tex-Mex or Cajun cuisines (and have taste buds that think ketchup is spicy), then you will probably like Border Cafe; if not, you should probably wait until you're really, REALLY desperate."},{"name":"Golden Garden","address":"63 Concord Ave","city":"Belmont","stars":"3.5","text":"Decided to order for dinner given the Yelp Rating and a friend's recommendation.

Franklin Barbecue is the lip smacking, euphoria inducing, absolute find of the moment that makes you so frikin' proud to be a meat eater.  Sorry vegetarians, you'll forever miss out on what it's like to eat something so perfect and delicious!  That's ok, less for you... more for me!  Franklin Barbecue is situated in a small lot off of I-35 & Concordia street.  It's not hard to miss, just do like Toucan Sam used to do and \\"follow your nose, it always knows!\\"  There's a beautiful constant puff of smoke emanating from the smoker that can be seen blocks away.  If that doesn't give it away, then the line of people waiting to order will surely point it out.  Speaking of line, count on waiting about 15 to 30 minutes... but it's sooooo worth it.   The food choices include pork ribs, brisket, sausage and chopped beef.  The sides are your barbecue standards like potato salad and beans.   As you approach the window, you'll be greeted as if you're family.  A little chit-chat about what's happening and a little taste of what ever you're getting.  I got very lucky and was treated to the edge piece of the brisket!  All you barbecue lovers know this to be the VERY best part of any brisket.  All the flavors are rolled up to the tip and give it an intensely flavorful taste.  Yes, that was my introduction to Franklin Barbecue, I couldn't think of a better way to meet my brand new addiction.  I ordered the 2 meat plate with pork ribs and brisket, then had them add a link of sausage so that I could try it.  As I sat down on one of the picnic benches, I noticed my friend was in a state of bliss.  I didn't want to bother him so I dove right in to my food.  I quickly found out why he was in such a state, because now I was a slobberin' fool too.  Where did this amazing flavor come from?  Who is this man that prepares such heavenly food?  When I die and go to heaven, will cherubs be feeding me this brisket on a daily basis?  Dear Lord, I sure hope so!  The brisket is perfectly moist and the \\"rub\\" tastes like nothing I've ever had before.  A little smoky, a little zesty, a little... oh man, there's no describing how good this is.  On to the pork ribs and again, I'm off to my world of bliss.  The meat falls off the bone, the taste requires no bbq sauce!  They do have 3 flavors of sauce (espresso, hot and sweet) and all three taste really good, but for my taste, the meat here doesn't need any.

The main courses were just as good as was the wine selection, but really the starters blew my mind. It is hard to leave such an irrevocable memory on my palette but Chef Mei did it.

To be completely honest, usually the line is quite long, as it seems understaffed during lunch hours. The food is quite expensive, considering what one might be ordering. For example, a kid's meal is $6.50 and includes either a grilled cheese sandwich, PB and J, hot dog or slice of pizza, plus a bag of chips and soda (bad choice) or milk. They have 1/4 burgers for $7.50 (add cheese for 50 cents), the appearance of these burgers is that of a perfectly pressed soy burger made from a lab.Recommendations: Personally, I believe their best sandwiches are their Reuben ($7.50) Tarragon Chicken Salad ($7.50), or Classic Club ($8). [ Seating ]For parents, they do have high chairs.

I sat at the bar by the kitchen and every dish that came out looked delicious. I read ahead time that Screen Door is known for the fried chicken. Accordingly, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was obsessed with fried chicken from Roy Rogers as a child growing up. However, the chain disappeared over the years and I outgrew fried chicken because fried food does not agree with my body well anymore. Even so, the fried chicken here is amazing. First, crispy skin is a requirement for any fried chicken and this dish certainly delivers from this perspective. Next, dry chicken is a pitfall in making fried chicken. However, the chicken at the Screen Door is tender and juicy throughout. Unlike most fried chicken, I felt completely fine after eating this dish and was full of energy for a day of hiking. The waffles are a solid complement to the fried chicken. It is not spectacular but definitely very good. I usually do not put syrup on my waffles. Nevertheless, I decided to dip pieces of my waffle in the Screen Door's syrup. It was excellent and I used it on the rest of my waffle. The Screen Door is very popular for brunch on the weekends. As a result, get there before it opens to get in line. I thought I had plenty of time to get there before it filled up 30 minutes after it opened at 9:30.

Was it the best ever - not on the day we were there, but it was still way near the top.  As a BBQ Judge I was in the middle of a BBQ Crawl (to compare Texas Q with that from the Midwest), with plans to sample as much Q as possible in 4 days (8 was the target).We went on a Tuesday, got there about 9:45 (they open the doors at 11), and waited with the 50 or so already in line.  By the time they started serving the line had grown to over a hundred.  I've been told this was a short line when compared to Saturday or Sunday.  Once the line started moving we got to the counter at noon.  As was our habit, we ordered (and split three ways) one slice of brisket, one pork rib, one slice of turkey, one sausage link and a dollop of pulled pork.Cutting straight to the bottom line, it was all VERY good.  We judged on three criteria, appearance, tenderness, and taste, and all meats scored over 8 (of 9) which certainly justifies their reputation.  The brisket was sliced a little to thick (I prefer mine about the thickness of a pencil), but that's not a negative for some people.  The rib was fall-off-the-bone tender which is a competitive no-no, but popular with many. The pulled pork had a strong smoked taste to it, leaving no doubt as to it's origins.Was it worth the experience - yes.

And, for the most part, it was.  Having just traveled to Israel this past summer, I have stayed away from hummus and falafel, fearing that I wouldn't find something comparable here in Boston.Here is my take on the food:Falafel- I have to say, I've had better.  It's not that it was bad... in fact, overall it was quite good.  Not dry, very flavorful.  But these had to be the tiniest falafel balls I've ever seen.  \\nHummus- Fresh and creamy.  Every day I think about the hummus I tried in Israel, which literally made me moan with pleasure.  This was up there and the next time I go here, I'm just going to get a big container of this with some pita.\\nSalad- The salad contained a lot of lettuce and cabbage and I found that it lacked flavor.  Could have used some more vinegar or something.  With that being said, it was a perfect companion to the hummus, which i spread across the top.\\nPita- This is real pita... unlike that wimpy stuff you find in the grocery store.

Great music and the characters are walking around mingling and it was great. We got some drinks and they passed out these delicious appetizer snacks to all the tables. Mac and cheese bites, mozzarella sticks, a perfect start. Knowing what I know now,  I would have filled up more on the pre-show snacks. The show was fun, entertaining, and with great audience participation it was a blast. The performers did an amazing job, my problem was with the dinner portion. Ughhhh omg not good. I cant complain about the unlimited beer but the food left sooo much to be desired. The mashed potatoes were passable, but the meat and veggies were so generic and low quality.The meat texture was the worst.

The flavor of the meat though along with your selected toppings just melts together in a way that it just great!The fries are typically more miss than hit. They will come out greasy and limp/undercooked or over cooked. There never seems to be enough seasoning added when you order the Cajun style seasoned fries. The regular portion size is more than enough for two people, you could share with three if you really wanted to. We ordered the little portion size this evening and it was enough for two to split and we hardly had any fries left after eating our burgers too. So as far as price and fry portion you get your monies worth.As for drinks I wish this place had the customizable \\"Coke freestyle\\" machine.

Both the music, and crowd although bustling, were not overly loud. Once we were seated however my experience went downhill faster than johnny knoxville in a rolled up carpet. It took over ten minutes for our waitress to make an appearence and when she did i wished she would just go away. Her attitude was curt, bordering on rude and certainly passive-aggressive in nature. Maybe she just got dumped or something, or maybe she doesn't like her job...i dont know, i don't care. Leave it at the door.  Anywho, other than a opening mojito served with more leaves than drink things seemed to get back on track with a nice, robust calamari appetizer. However that was quickly de-railed when my entree arrived. The dish came with a peice of meat the size of hockey puck, sided by three measley stems of asparagus and buried in a bunch of  green leaf that was obviously supposed to make the dish look more robust. I should not have to pay 20+ bucks for this should I? No. Now, this review is based on a single experience and i have heard from an elite Yelper that this place is actually very good sooo..they say you never have a second chance to make a first impression but having an open mind i will give them the benefit of another visit and prehaps revise my review.

When we arrived and attempted to put my name down, the wait time increased to 1 hour.. Since we were both starving, we discussed if we should wait or go somewhere else and decided to stay. I came back to put our name down and was now told it would be around 1.5 hours... I am not sure how accurate these times are since they seemed to increased exponentially for no apparent reason, yes there were a lot of people waiting, but the hostess seemed like she was making up the times. Instead of waiting for a table, we decided to do take out which they stated would only be 30 minutes. While waiting in line to place my order, I overheard the hostess say to her co worker \\"OMG, I can't believe these stupid people are still waiting for a table and I am telling them it's a two to three hour wait\\"... I was shocked to hear a comment like this. How on earth can you make the decision to lie to your customers to make your job easier; it was insane for her to say something like that.But on to the food. I got the everything plate: pulled pork, double ribs (extra $4), and smoked wings with a side of chili Mac and slaw. The ribs were amazing, fall of the both and very tender. There wasn't a need to add any additional sauce of any sort. The wings were also equally amazing and delicious. I am not a huge fan of pasta sides but the chili mac was great and the cole slaw was fresh and light. The everything plate was perfect for the two of us and we devoured everything besides the toast..SN: while waiting for our take out food, we noticed at least 3-4 four person tables, one large 6 person table and a couple 2 person tables that were unoccupied and clean for a good 15 mins if not longer.. that was probably the reason why the wait time was so long because they didn't fill the tables quickly enough.Also, the employee who barely stated my name when my order was ready only said it once and I thought he said my name so I had to go flag him down.. and when I did he had already put my order away and was working on something else...

There were no chairs, and we are standing around the table waiting for one of them to pull up chairs, even though the place had plenty of tables with 4 chairs. They dont bring out our silverware even after the appetizers come. He forgets that I ordered a beer and charged me for one but I never got it. I order lobster. The lobster arrives at my table with no lobstershell cracker thing. I pull off the tail and eat that part but its straight up impossible to eat the claws without a cracker.  So I ask for one and the guy is sulking and unapologetically sarcastic. \\nPositive note: The schezuan duck was quite fantastic. Also, you definitely have to order their bok choy.

Service was great, we had a reservation and were seated immediately. A few of us at the table were quite chilly, and our waitress kindly got the temperature turned up a little. So, great s twice and experience all around. On to the food, our table had:\\n- Bread - The complimentary cornbread and biscuits were amazing. That was some seriously good cornbread.\\n- Fried Green Tomatoes - These were incredible. They were melt in your mouth, and the goat cheese and tomato sauce worked perfectly. The tomatoes were crispy without too much breading. Seriously amazing, probably some of the best fried green tomatoes I've had.\\n- Fried Chicken - Crunchy, cooked well. Juicy and flavorful, and the mashed potatoes that came with it were great. The collard greens were just okay, needed a little salt. The amazingness of the chicken and potatoes made the greens pale in comparison. Overall a great dish.\\n- Trout - This fish was incredible. The fish was so tender and the skin was perfectly crispy, not soggy or chewy at all. The veggies were awesome, and the sauce was so delicious I could probably eat it with a spoon.\\n- Chocolate Cake - Decadent. If you love chocolate, this dessert is for you. Moist, rich cake, and that toasted marshmallow frosting is the perfect addition.\\n- Banana Pudding - This is a classic, and SCK does it right. It tastes fresh and delicious, perfectly made, and the shortbread cookie is a great touch.Overall, this restaurant is awesome, and I highly recommend it.

There was also a bar fight - hey, it happens - but this went on for several minutes and nobody from the staff did a single thing.  I found it pretty tacky that it was left up to fellow (and unrelated) patrons to pull the dudes apart.  Toward the end of our somewhat brief stay at Kung Fu's, the crowds did seem to die down.

I had about 90+ minutes for lunch on Thursday which I thought based on the reviews was enough time and early enough to get BBQ.   My review is going to have to hit Franklin's in its Achilles heel, THE LINE and the slow rate of service.   I have read some reviews on Yelp where customers have come 3-4 times and not even gotten to eat after waiting in line for almost an hour and finally getting food on their 5th visit.. The funny thing is they only reviewed on their successful 5th try.  But what about those first 4 unsuccessful visits?    Yes, I waited in line 30 minutes just to get to the door and quickly realized that I was in store for another 30 minutes just to get to the counter.   Yes, I'm sure the food is excellent if you are willing to wait an hour to get some.   The line moves at about 1 person every minute.It struck me that I will not be able to make it back to my office for a 1pm meeting, so I had to bail unfortunately.    Luckily there are other eateries in the general area..So note to proprietors of Franklin, I invested 40 minutes of my day to visit your establishment and hopefully eat there and I merely got to your door frame.In the past when I went to this location when it was Ben's Longbranch, the line would go out the door on Soul Food Wednesdays.  A line, Yes, but it was still moving at a reasonable rate.   Unless you have two full hours or more for lunch, I'd have to pass.   I know I'm not the only one who came, arrived, waited, waited, waited and left on an empty stomach...Maybe on my next visit, I'll have two hours or more for lunch, can arrive early and leave a better more favorable review.

A full-on fast food place is probably more sanitary than this! All bread products I consumed were stale. My salad came in a huge bowl with only one tiny tomato slice and half an olive. My waiter was pretty nice and did bring a few extra tomatoes when I asked for them. The stuffed mushrooms came suspended in some kind of oil-like fluid and most of the stuffing was smashed out in the oil rather than on top of the mushrooms. I ate at The Olive Garden once many years ago and I don't remember it being such poor quality.

Not only do they have several, delicious Vegetarian options, all of their tacos taste fresh and are prepared consistently every time. I know what to expect when I stop in and I get exactly what I ordered every single time. My favorite taco is the 'Heather' but I often grab the breakfast 'build your own' tacos because they are a little cheaper. Their Mexican mashed potatoes are out of this world (yes, it seems strange to get mashed potatoes on a taco, but try one with refried black beans and mashed potatoes on corn and you will be hooked!). Both the Queso and Guacamole are delicious and they give free refills on chips, which is great since many small Taco Joints charge for extra chips.The salsa bar is wonderful, I love being able to pick my own salsa and grab as much or as little as I would like. The Roja Salsa is so good you could drink it. The Dona salsa is arguably the most flavorful salsa in Austin, but for those with weak taste buds, it is a bit on the spicy side. You can also buy pints of Salsa to go, which I do frequently because it is so tasty!Stopping in around lunchtime at any location, you can expect a wait, but the cashiers move the line quickly and Taco D is on top of their game when it comes to getting orders out.

Empanadas are liked steamed dumplings pumped with human growth hormone and steroids... oh and Mexican seasoning. What's not to love?This place is often crowded, and the servers can't seem to attend to all their tables properly. The food is the trump card here though. They give enough tortilla chips (thin and crispy, yum) and salsa to make you forget you're not getting enough attention.

The whole place is extremely cozy and it offers a nice excuse to check out the newly developed waterfront, that I'm not sure many locals ever go to hang out in.A great set of options inside Cart Lab including Koi Fusion, Tight Tacos, PDX Sliders, Wasabi Sushi,  Fomo chicken, and top it off with Gelato Maestro, and all of them are delicious!

It's convenient, affordable and offers enough variety so that meat-eaters and vegetarians can all have something. The wait staff is usually very friendly. We've gotten to know some of them, which is good because I have some of the world's pickiest friends. THis one doesn't want ice, this one can't have milk, that one wants to basically rewrite the menu. We're hard to please.I really like the yuppie nachos with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes.Some items on the menu are quite good -- the burgers, particularly the veggie burger, are delicious and can be customized many ways. The salads and soups are also usually good.Problem is, there are some items to stay away from. The hummus platter. The non-Christopher's veggie burger. The black bean soup. The pasta dishes are hit or miss. It's hard to know what will be good and what will suck. I've heard rave reviews about the buffalo tofu but haven't ventured yet.We've had some probs with the management. The last escapade involved a pitcher of margarita that had almost no alcohol in it. It didn't taste right.  My friends sent it back, but were still charged. The manager put the server in the middle and was too cowardly to come over and deal. I didn't have the drink, so I scuttled out of there before the end, but apparently my friends had to fight to get the returned drink removed.So, conclusion. Hard to say.

I wanted to visit Franklin based on their Yelp rating, but really hadn't read the ratings in detail.  Therefore, when we drove by on a Friday afternoon at 12:15pm and saw the long line outside, I thought it would be a good idea to run a few errands and return after the lunch rush.  We returned around 1pm and there was still a line.  When we walked to the line, we were told by other customers that they had sold out.  My first thought was \\"if they're sold out, why are you still in line?\\"  Thinking they joking with us, we stayed there.  A few minutes later, a waitress came out and gave us the infamous \\"Last Man Standing\\" sign....whew!Immediately, we were impressed when the waitress took our drink order and delivered it to us while we were in line.  Although we were in line for over an hour, we enjoyed the wait.  We met the couple in front of us (also first timers) and they agreed not to take the last of the BBQ if it should come to that.  As soon as the line entered the building, I knew we were in for a treat... there were some very satisfied-looking people eating some great looking BBQ, including a tiny 20-something coed savoring what we later learned was the \\"Tipsy Texan\\", a ridiculously large BBQ sandwich.As it turns out, being the \\"Last Man Standing\\" comes with perks.  We split the last of the sausage and ribs with the couple in front of us.  Mr. Franklin also hooked us up with a combination of both lean and fatty brisket.  We ended up with about 2-3 lbs of meat for a great price...luckily our hotel had a kitchenette!When we sat down to eat, I first tried the lean brisket and thought it was the best brisket I've ever had.  Turns out, I was wrong.  The fatty brisket at Franklin BBQ is, in fact, the best brisket that has ever been created!!!  At that moment, I entered BBQ euphoria!  I can't even explain how good it was except to say that I usually like my brisket with some bread, cheese, and/or jalapenos.  Well, in this case all of that other stuff just gets in the way...the meat is perfect and can stand alone.   The ribs were also outstanding and since we only had two of them, my wife and I had to barter for who would get the last bite.  I wasn't crazy about the sausage, the sides, or the sauces, but who cares.  We did take a piece of Lemon Chess pie back the hotel, which we found out later was also amazing!Fast forward to this week during a business trip to San Antonio.  Well, I HAD to make sure I wasn't dreaming about my earlier trip to Franklin BBQ.  I flew into SA  Wednesday night and woke up early Thursday for the 70 mile trip to Austin....this time I made sure to arrive early.  As it turns out,  I wasn't dreaming about my last visit and Franklin was just as good as the first time (even better since I didn't have to share my ribs).  And if I do happen to be dreaming, please don't pinch me because I don't wanna wake up.I'm not sure when I'll make my next trip to the region but when I do, I guarantee you'll see me at Franklin BBQ.

We went here for their NYE 4 course menu, and was disappointed from beginning to end. One would think for $81, a whole shrimp would be served in the shrimp cocktail, but I guess not.The meal started off well as we had a few drinks at the bar prior, and I do recommend the Premium Margarita and Sangria Margarita as both were really good and strong. But things quickly went downhill from there. We sat down at our table when our reservation was ready, and started with the shrimp cocktail. No lie, we received a shot glass with a horseradish cocktail sauce, and 1 shrimp hanging off the side. Well, I thought it was one shrimp, but it was actually HALF A SHRIMP. They sliced each shrimp down the middle and that is what was considered \\"shrimp cocktail\\"...what a joke. It really was insulting that they would even serve something like that.We move on to course 2...The beet salad and lamb ravioli. The ravioli wasn't bad, but the beet salad had so much ginger in it that it was inedible. I took one bite and couldn't stomach a 2nd. As we stared at our plates for a good 20 minutes while 2 waitresses and the hostess noticed we were finished yet looked away, they were eventually cleared and dinner was served.Course 3 consisted of the rib eye steak (add $12 to the bill for beef...), and the pork chop entree. After roughly half of the pork chop, the spices were so overpowering, that the rest couldn't be eaten. I was able to get through 3/4 of the rib eye before the same happened to me. We are both very tolerable to heat, yet this was very unexpected. If I wanted Hell Night, I would go to ECG. Needless to say, the extra $12 for rib eye went uneaten as I just couldn't take anymore and my disgust quickly killed my appetite. Another 15 minutes of staring at \\"finished\\" plates before they are cleared, and dessert comes.The Mexican flan was another bright spot though, yet the banana rolls were like mushy banana filled egg rolls. Not crispy or crunchy in the least. All in all, we were totally disappointed with a place we had heard nothing but good things about.

Ordered two Flights to try out eight of the beers they had on tap.Quality\\nDead Lizard Brewing Company has created some very bold and brash beers, and even though not every one hit for me, I left quite impressed. I ordered two Flights, giving me a chance to try eight of the thirteen beers they had on tap. I tried Butterscotch Caramel Bliss Uncle Pudgy's Two Fisted Porter, Extra Hoppy Bits, Salted Caramel Dragon, Mutatiosaurus Pineapple New England IPA, Purple Skink IPA, Komodo \\"Koko\\" Dragon Chocolate Stout, and Key Lime Chameleon Cream-Sic-Ale. The fact that they place focus on porters, stouts, and IPAs, my personal preferences in beer, immediately put them in my good graces. But it was the delicious smells that emanate from the beers, that really draws you in. No beer did it better than the Salted Caramel Dragon, a delicious stout that took advantage of the caramel sweetness to develop its flavor. I also found myself favoring Extra Hoppy Bits, an American IPA that just hit the right notes. The only beer that did not really do it for me was the Mutatiosaurus Pineapple New England IPA, which did not find that middle-ground between citrusy and hoppy. However, when you are nitpicking the beers, it clearly means they are doing things right.Quantity\\nThe Flights came with four 5oz beers, which has become the standard, while drafts were either 10oz or 16oz.Value\\nFlights went for around $13, which is a little high in comparison to other breweries. I believe with the flights they actually charged based on the beer selected, so it may be higher or lower based on your choices. Meanwhile drafts ran from $5 to $8 depending on the beer.Ambiance\\nDead Lizard Brewing Company is located in the southwest Orlando area, relatively close to Universal Studios. Off the beaten trail within an industrial park, the brewery takes up a massive warehouse space. Outside they have a small grassy area arranged with chairs and large pieces of art. However, being that it was night and rainy, I spent my visit inside. Inside the space is relatively large and it feels even bigger because of the high ceilings. With a mixture of concrete and temporary walls, along with exposed ventilation, you will not forget you are in a warehouse. The space has a small bar along one wall and then a dozen or so tables set up around it. They have a few windows into the brewery area, so you can see where the magic happens. A small television sat in the corner playing episodes of Saved By The Bell and in the background a solid mix of indie rock music played.Crowd\\nBy the time I arrived at the brewery, it was already pretty late. Combine that with less than ideal weather and the fact that it was a weeknight, and you don't exactly have a recipe for a big crowd. What I did find were a few stragglers, all wearing UCF gear, who originally beat the rain, but were unwilling to head back out until it stopped. I would imagine a much bigger crowd on the weekend.Service\\nThe bartender was very knowledgable not only about the beers being served, but the overall beer community in central Florida. She was friendly and frank about what she recommended and what other spots I should check out while in the area.Parking\\nLocated in a large warehouse within an industrial park, there is a massive parking lot for guests of the brewery.Extra\\nWhile some beer purists are not going to love the more gimmicky flavors on Dead Lizard Brewing Company's menu, I found them funky and fun. I love how you can really smell the added salted caramel and butterscotch as soon as the beer is poured. And while the space is relatively simple, it gets the job done. A brewery worthy of a visit when looking for a break from the theme park action."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is a great spot in Midtown, right off the beaten path of Peachtree.

We started with a before picture.  Then had to take an after picture of perfectly clean white plates because EVERYTHING WAS GONE! So good!!! \\nFried chicken was juicy and perfectly golden brown.  The waffle was perfection as it was crispy on the outside and super light and fluffy on the inside.  \\nCrab hash - as other people have mentioned, layers and layers of incredible flavors.  Tomatoes added a great kick and the hollandaise was not your usual goopey fatty mess, but a light, elegant sauce that was a good addition the dish, without being overpowering.\\nService was also really good even though the house was packed.

However the one I go to most is a cart, at 1100 NW Glisan Street (between 11th and 12th)! The Whole Bowl features just one menu item, the, um, whole bowl. It comes in two sizes and is vegetarian, and can be vegan too if you leave out the cheese and sour cream. At first the dish seems too healthily simple, being just brown rice, red and black beans, fresh avocado, salsa, black olives, sour cream, Tillamook cheddar and cilantro, but it's the sauce that makes it. It's a super-delicious lemony-garlicky sauce that they say is, \\"referred to by many as \\"crack sauce,\\" and I'd agree. It's surprising that a meal so good for you can be that delightful and make you feel so good. Further, even though it's \\"just a cart\\" the woman who runs it is an absolute sweetheart who remembers customer names and preferences (and there are a helluva lot of customers) and who greets everyone with a smile and a a little chat (but is still super-fast on service).

The waiter seemed more concerned with their tip from the other two tables we could see, that and our drinks were only refilled once the entire time we were there for an hour and 1/2. The combo boxes had a lot of great flavors to them but the disappointment was in the \\"slider\\". This was more of a quarter sized patty (the pickle chip covered it entirely) on a oversized bun. I also couldn't substitute the sweet potato fries for anything without a $3.00 up charge to something else. It's better to. Come with a friend and just. Split a burger and a sushi roll between the two of you.Now the highlights. For appetizers, the fried pickles are a must. A huge bowl of pickle chips with two dipping sauces that will be more than enough for four people. Definitely a must. None were soggy and all had a great flavor to them. The calamari was a great and flavorful treat as well. They actually put the sweet chili sauce on the bottom of the plate so that every piece gets a bit of it. Again, no soggy pieces were found and all had a great flavor.For mains I highly suggest the tropical storm roll, high class hillbilly and the Boursin burger. The burger was big and cooked to perfection. Also the onion roll went so well with the grilled mushrooms and aioli. It had a great overall grilled taste and was very filling.The tropical storm roll has to be my perfect sushi roll. It has a little bit of everything. Salmon, tuna, yellowtail and then you get a bite of siracha and some sweet eel sauce. The roll is just amazing and the quality of fish is of a nice high quality.Then the high class hillbilly. Don't let this roll fool you, though it says high class, it's incredibly messy. But you won't care because the taste is amazing. Pulled pork that's been deep fried in potatoes with a sweet coleslaw, they got a winner with this roll. The potato \\"nest\\" strings on top were a great crunch to the messy BBQ part of the roll and were good to munch on when you finished it off. It may sound weird, but the taste and portion are on point.

This has happened to us quite a few times. While I would not classify this as a \\"dirty\\" restaurant, I think the little lights that are set up on the walls by the booths and the windowsills could use a good dusting.  I never sit up against them, but I'd imagine if I did, I wouldn't want the dust caked on them that close to my food. Regardless of its few flaws, if you want good service, tasty food, and something affordable in a less-than-stellar economy...this is the place to go!"},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"im not entirely convinced this is a great place to eat. honestly, the only reasons i come here is because the atmosphere and my friends want to try it.it's very Austin-y with the trailer thing and food served in cones. not easy to eat out of.everything is fried and served on cole slaw. so if you aren't into that, avoid this place.i usually get the chicken & avocado. its a half avocado and a small chicken breast thats been deep fried with sesame seeds wrapped in a tortilla and filled with cole slaw.they have chili dusted fries as well which is average.\\nso its nice to sit outside and eat out of a cone on congress but not the healthiest, not the best.try it once, bring your friends so you dont have to come back if you dont want."},{"name":"Quesabrosa","address":"3954 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Outside seating only, this little food truck is just what you need.

The chinese cabbage and pork dumplings were very good,  and tasted even better, with the vinegar, that came with the dinner. The leek dumpling, was also very rich, strong, with what seemed to be garlic. If you are an individual who is used to Americanized chinese food, like a pupu platter, this may not be the choice for you. The service was good, friendly, appreciative, all the good things, you hope to have, when you do business, with a eatery, but there was a slight language barrier. oh well. I will give it another try, and pick different items on the menu. There was a group of people, and a couple dining in, and they were both asian. That is always a good sign.

The owners are incredibly nice, they come out and check up on you frequently. There's also a coffee and taco place near by that you can grab breakfast while you wait. I highly recommend grabbing lawn chairs, coffee, games, and good friends to help through the wait time. As far as the food? Delicious, only in Texas can you get something of this caliber. Love the beef brisket with the soft white bread. Their bourbon pie is also really tasty. If you are flying any BBQ home, make sure to preorder them a head of time because they cannot really accommodate with hot/cold bags on the spot."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was friendly, price was ok for the amount of food, but the chicken was not good.

Our group of 4 was basically ignored and every round came late, but that I'll let pass because it was a busy Friday night and that happens sometimes. I'm giving 2 stars because the food was very average southern comfort food at an undeserving price point. There are numerous Southern comfort restaurants all over town that offer at least the same quality and atmosphere for less. I don't mind spending more (sometimes a lot more) if you're getting the level of quality food, service, and atmosphere that is commensurate with the price. In this case, you're paying top end pricing for small basic comfort food entree dishes that don't even include a side dish (which have to be ordered separately). I don't mind this at a fine steakhouse, but when you're charging me a premium for pork loin or a trout filet in an old house, please include a veggie or something. Hate to be harsh but we dropped quite a tab on drinks and dinner only to get poor/forgotten service, average food (in small portions), in a basic no frills venue."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I'm in a really generous mood.  I haven't seen my friend since last February and we were both hungry so this is where we ended up.  I enjoyed her company and catching up so much so that I overlooked a couple of things:1.  Waitress telling us the specials and at the same time quoting the price.  How tacky is that?  Wow!  I believe that was a first for me.  2.  Water in a plastic cup.  Not a glass, a cup.  And the cup said Hefeweizen or Samual Adams, couldn't remember but it was a beer company.  Did Tia's run out of real glasses and have these lying around?  3.  No refills on the water.  Not even a pour from a busbuy or the waitress.  Ok, so you've skimped on the silverware, the service, but the water?  How low can you go?  The only reason you get one star is because your clam chowder was pretty good and so were your fish and chips.  If you're walking by the waterfront, keep on walking.

They simply do not speak English well. That said, each server genuinely tried their best to explain what was contained in each dumpling.

Your stomach will thank you later."},{"name":"Appetito","address":"761 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"2","text":"I'd like to give this 2 and 1/2 stars but I can't so I'll be kind and round up.  We arrived at 6pm on a Monday and there was no one in the restaurant--literally, no one.  We found that a little odd.  We were told to sit wherever we wanted.  We came here because of a Groupon, and it was for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert.  My sister and I both opted for the steak topped with shrimp special.  It was decent--I've had steaks that were cooked better, and the shrimp were definitely overdone (and previously frozen?), but the seasoning was very good.  It made for good leftovers for lunch today.  My glass of merlot was tasty for the price.  The appetizer we got was a sashimi tuna and it just seemed odd to me.  It was served with a blob of seasoned mayo on the side of the plate--- very crude presentation.  I'm guessing this was supposed to be an aioli?  It had salad greens with chopped up mozzarella and roasted red peppers on the side.  It was okay, but just seemed like they were trying to do a Japanese/Italian fusion that didn't really work.  For dessert our waitress told us the creme brule was \\"2nd to none\\" so we ordered it.  In reality, it was cold in the middle (obviously pre-made and then re-heated), had a chunky consistency (creme brule should be creamy and smooth in the middle), with an overly heavy/burnt crust (you're supposed to use superfine sugar on the top of creme brule, and toast it with a torch---you can tell they used regular sugar and just stuck it under the broiler in the oven).  So I was unimpressed.  Also, our coffee didn't come out until we were almost done with dessert.  The restaurant now had 2 other tables of guests, so I kinda thought it should be easy between the 2 waitresses to bring us everything promptly, but I guess not.  In her defense the waitress was very sweet and did offer to give us a new dessert when she asked us how we thought it was and we said it was just \\"good.\\"  She said \\"JUST good??  Do you want something else?  I can get you a tiramisu instead!\\"  We said no thank you, we were full, and paid the bill.  I had no desire to have a mediocre tiramisu on top of a below-average creme brule.  At least the Groupon saved us a lot of money.  I would probably not go back unless I had another Groupon, but it was worth a one-time experience."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"Been to this particular Olive garden multiple times, I always leave full and happy.Love the Lasagna frita app and the tour of Italy is filling.

The cream cheese is definitely creamy and delicious. The carrot cake looked moist, but unfortunately was on the brittle side. It had all the right ingredients, including nuts and raisins, but it was still pretty bland. It seemed as if they might have left out a vital ingredient - such as the carrot itself! Or perhaps the cinnamon or sugar because it was lacking in sweetness. Hopefully we fare better with our next choice...can't go wrong with chocolate right?!(6/10) Double Dose\\nChocolate buttercream top, chocolate cake. This is a solid cupcake. We were pleased to find that the chocolate buttercream had a rich texture and chocolaty taste -  because buttercreams are usually a little lighter. Seriously...Hey Cupcake has got the icing part down! The cupcake was moist but a little spongy.  Even though it was solid, there was nothing that set it apart from cupcakes elsewhere. Next time we would try the Michael Jackson or the Sweetberry.Service (5/10)We came on a Friday afternoon and the place was empty. The girl behind the counter was nice and took our order promptly. Although it is more fun to eat cupcakes by stuffing your face, it would have been nice to have the option to use plasticware. We also wished they had a jug of water or a water fountain because one of the cupcakes was a bit dry. Our table had many crumbs and icing smears on it, so we made sure to use the napkins to clean and bus our table after we finished eating. The service was fine but Hey Cupcake can add small touches to make the experience better.Ambiance (6/10)This is the only location that is actually in a building, because all the other locations use an airstream trailer. However, this Allandale location does use a trailer inside as part of the decor.  The interior is very minimalist and mildly cute, with shirts for sale hanging on the walls. There were only three tables and six chairs, which was fine since it was empty. But if it were a busier day - that might pose an issue. For a bakery that specializes in cupcakes, we were hoping to find a larger selection and more unique flavors.

The seafood is very fresh and the prices are not offensive.  I gave this 3 stars based on my dish, a Seafood Fra Diavolo.  When you have a Fra Diavolo, you are expecting it to have some kick.  The seafood was very good, but sauce lacking ANY heat.  It was more like a marinara, than a fra diavolo.  I gave feedback to the kitchen, but based on the response, I think they are deliberately trying to be safe in their spicing (think like a cafeteria who goes light on salt and spiciness).  If you are going to do that, then you have to rename that dish.  I think I'll go back, but I'll be sure to tell the kitchen that I want heat and I'll send it back if they don't do it.

They do have chairs available for camping out underneath the deck but at this point, they were all taken. We went to the CVS around the corner to pick up some cheap chairs and more snacks. It was definitely an experience that I would highly recommend! The other ladies joined us in line with beer and mimosas towards the end of our wait. Once we were inside we ordered approximately 9 pounds of ribs, 5 pounds of brisket, and a taste of the pulled pork. The ribs and brisket are incredible. Literally the meat falls off the bone on the ribs, and pulled pork melts in your mouth. The sides were quite delicious as well -- we tried the potato salad, beans (spicy, my favorite!), and coleslaw. We also tried two of their pies -- the pecan, lemon, and banana cream -- all equally amazing. I would definitely recommend getting in line earlier than we did.

As usual, things didn't quite work out the way I had hoped. First off, my flight was delayed 3.5 hours. (I hate you, United) No worries, my friend was soothing the savage beast with promises of chicken in a cone straight from the airport. But when we walked up to the trailer I was devastated to see that they were closed. At 9:15pm on a Friday night. Now why in the world would you stop serving the perfect drunk food before people have the chance to get drunk and hungry. Ugh. So the next day we decide to hit the trailer for lunch. Two chicken cones, some spicy fries and a Dublin Dr. Pepper later and I'm a happy camper. The cones were as good as I remembered, the fries decent but nothing special. I was actually so overwhelmed by the fact that they were open that I didn't bother reading the menu until after I had ordered - the fried shrimp cone and pulled pork cone also sounded great. Service was fine, albeit a bit gruff. Sure, I had a shit eating grin on my face as I ordered since I was about to experience my first chicken cone in over a year but that's no reason to treat me like an idiot. And prices were just teetering on the high side - one cone isn't enough to fill me up, two is pure gluttony (so of course I had two) but when you factor in fries and a drink you're looking at $15+ for lunch served from a trailer, eaten at picnic tables.

The pizza is also just really bad and the salads are worse than those at a gas station so after trying a few times I am not going to eat here anymore anyways.On top of that, the staff is rude and makes fun of customers after they pay.

They wanted to capitalize on the college kid's healthy diet of pizza and beer. After 26 years they now have over 100 pizza shops in 15 states and continue to grow at a rapid pace.  Now honestly this was probably one of the last places we were going to review on our list in Austin, kind of writing it off as corporate college 'junk' pizza.  We were out early for lunch on this day, so we killed some time at a local coffee shop.  While sitting there sippin' on some coffee we asked a couple of patrons what pizzas they liked and a few said to try Mellow Mushroom.  We both agreed maybe we should give this a try; maybe it is good after all.We finished our coffees and drove to the University of Texas campus in downtown Austin.  We drove around the block a couple times but parking was kind of rough around there. The parking next to the MM is $8, which is insane for a quick lunch. We ended up parking down the street a bit and just hoofed it.  We get quickly sat by the waitress who was extremely friendly and helpful.  As always we try to keep it simple with the cheese and pepperoni pie.  The place is a wide open concept that looks like it was decorated by a college hippie. Clearly making sure they play off the hippie, burnout, relax vibe throughout the place.  When we get seated the place was slow, it got busier throughout the lunch.  After about 45 minutes of waiting on our pie I began to understand where they got the name \\"Mellow Mushroom\\".  No matter how busy it was the two pizza cooks in the back worked at the same \\"Mellow\\" pace.Once the pizza arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance and aroma of the pie. It took forever to get it...but we were in no rush.  Cooking on gas deck ovens at a high temperature gave the crust a nice crunch, nicely charred on the bottom. I liked that the dough was made from a honey-wheat flour instead of the normal white flour.  It gave the pizza more texture and flavor.  The pizza was topped with plenty of decent gooey mozzarella cheese and then a generous dusting of parmesan.  They also threw some buttered garlic parmesan on the crust for a nice touch.   It was a well flavored pizza that flowed nicely. The wait was stupid long, but the waitress and pizza helped with the time. Go there if you have a ton of time and are not in a rush.

My sister also ordered the s'more milkshake and it was AWESOME. Made me regret not ordering one. For main courses our group ordered\\nThe Miss Moffet Roll: Good, basic sushi roll\\nThe CBCLT burger: fantastic! The burgers are charred just a bit and the brioche bun was fresh and fluffy. \\nThe chinese chicken salad: HUGE and delicious. Wasn't sure about the peanut ranch vinaigrette, but it was really good\\nTaste Explosion Roll: interesting. basically a burger in sushi form (beef with cheese, wrapped in rice and sliced in to sushi rolls, topped with tomato). It really wasn't bad, but it was a little odd, like my mouth wasn't sure what was going on. \\nFusion Specialty Bento Box: Great way to try everything. The bento boxes come with sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, edamame, a slider and 4 peiced of a roll (I got the Boss roll). Loved all of it!Now for the issues. When the food came out, our waitress told us the salad and bento box were going to be another minute, which wasn't a problem, especially for my sister (she had the salad) since she was splitting the burger with my mom. The fries for the burger were not warm at all. We let the waitress know and she brought out a HUGE bowl of fresh fries. My bento box took so long that everyone else was pretty much done eating and my sister ended up cancelling her salad since the burger filled her up. When my box did arrive, the slider wasn't really warm, and my waitress immediatly took it back to the kitchen without me even asking. Then when it came back the sweet potato fries were cold, but I didn't really care at that point, but she insisted I get fresh ones and brought me a bowl of them. Then the kitchen manager came out with a chinese chicken salad and told us it was on him but he wanted us to at least get to try it. The floor manager also told us that they took my bento box off the bill, which I honestly didn't think was necessary since they had been so on the ball with correcting the issues with is.

The atmosphere was really cool and the staff was attentive and well mannered however the food lacked thrill and flavor.  Beer= good.We had a sampling of four of their 'small plates' with beer on the side. First we had their 'Dip' (spinach and artichoke dip) this was far to creamy and needed to have additional cheese added.  The bread provided for dipping was burnt on one side and was definitely cut way to far in advance for the service.  Next we tried the meatballs.  The red sauce and bread provided with the meatballs were fantastic however the meatballs themselves had only been seasoned on the outside.  They made no effort to season the actual meat making the meat bland when eating it.  Secondly the meatballs were tough and over-cooked. We then decided instead of having one of the restaurants main courses we would stick with the 'small plates' because everyone around us was getting huge portions on their main plate.  We went with The French Onion soup which was a little on the salty side but this may be because I don't like traditionally salty food and french onion has never been one of my favorites.  I do like that they used some alternative cheese for the soup topping (not sure what) but they didn't use the traditional Swiss Cheese.  Lastly we finished with a simple Cesar Salad.  To bad the greens were under dressed and the lettuce was all Romain hearts with little Romain tops (all yellow and white greens with no dark greens at all).   We took their Duck Wings home to eat as well.  These were the highlight of the meal as they were cooked perfectly and they had a sweet glaze covering every inch of the moist meat. Yes I am foodie and many of the complaints I brought up should not deter the average diner from trying Wild Horse Cafe however I do think the product served was not worth the price on the menu."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"2728 New Spring Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Found a place serving dinner @ 10:00pm and sat at the bar to eat & watch MNF.

The bartenders are knowledgeable and willing to pour out just about anything you can come up with... even when you're not exactly sure what you want, but have an idea of the liquor and taste you like!Two reasons I give this place 2 stars: the crowd that showed up later on while I was there with a chill group on a Saturday night and the bar stool incident.  I arrived with a group of friends around 9 or so.  I wasn't looking to go crazy, so I was relieved when I found the bar was fairly empty and pretty chill.  We bounced from game to game, and I was able to spend some quality time with my vodka and Ms. Pacman.  A few hours later, probably around 11, I looked up and the bar was filling up with hipsters... many of them in onesies... so that upped the douche-factor quite quickly.  Then one of the staff took my damn bar stool away!  (God knows why.)  I was just sitting at the bar, chatting with a friend and the bartender, and then this dude tells me he has to take my bar stool because he has to clear them all out of the bar.  I looked around and, sure enough, there were others now standing at the bar, looking awkward because they also had been de-stooled... as if moving the bar stools is really going to make more room for all the hipsters pouring into the bar at that point.

I don't know if they've always had the Vaquero, but this is my new favorite. Eggs scrambled with roasted peppers and corn. Add a little Dona sauce and I am in heaven. I love that they offer wheat tortillas and their eggs are cage-free (happy eggs!) I also tried the Otto and my old favorite the Popeye (2 different visits--don't judge). The bacon on the Otto was a bit overcooked, but I still loved it so much I didn't even ask for better bacon as I probably should have. I just couldn't part with that lovely combination of beans and avocado and smokey bacon. Popeye, of course, is just as it sounds, awesome cheesy spinach with eggs. Jess' Special is also a favorite from the northside, migas with avocado and mashed potatoes. Try it!My boyfriend and I both noticed that this location seems to be less skimpy than the one up north where we had gone before. Which actually made him okay with going again, being that he didn't feel ripped off. The staff is great here, as the one up north.

My date and I had a drink at the bar and waited.After we were seated, the service was very attentive.  We shared the Tempura Crisped Jumbo Prawn starter, and it was excellent.  Although the portion was perhaps small for sharing, they asked when we ordered if we were sharing and prepared it so the nice presentation was intact when split.  I got the Beef Short Ribs and my date got the Steak au Poivre and a glass of red wine.  My short ribs were very good, but not superb.  I tried his Steak au Poivre, and it was really excellent.  Next time I go to Aria, I may have to order that.  For dessert, we split the Valrhona Chocolate Cream Pie and it was awesome.Anyway, overall it was a great experience.

BBQ fans and foodies far and wide need to find a way to get to Franklin BBQ and experience this life changing culinary event. Here are some tips that made our experience both fun and special:\\n1. Get there early (we arrived at 8:30 and we were 15th in line.) Bring chairs, beers, and a book. 2. Order meat by the pound, and order more than you think you can eat. I say this for two reasons. The first being the food is so good that you probably will eat more than usual, secondly you're going to want to bring some home for later. 3. Eat a light breakfast, you're going to want the room. 4. Have fun and enjoy the experience. My wife though I was crazy when I told her I wanted to be there at 8:30, but when it was all said and done we had a pretty awesome time experiencing everything.

It's cozy, and it did get a little loud at times. The bar is in the center of the restaurant and it's surrounded by tables, exposed brick, and white tile that looks like it was stolen from Gaslight. We were seated and went about ordering.For our appetizer, we shared the beef carpaccio. Ward 8 has an interesting preparation here - covered in a pickled creme fraiche and fried oysters. While it was good and tasty, I think I'd prefer a more traditional carpaccio. For entrees, I ordered the steak frites - the steak was good, and the fries were a tad over-seasoned in some sort of herb mixture. The chef got the lamb bolognese and mentioned that the pasta was undercooked and the \\"foccacia crouton\\" was stale and inedible.Overall, service was good and attentive, but the food just didn't really stand out.

I would review the food if I could buy the food. I was at this business an hour after it opened and they had sold out of food. While I'm happy the business is doing well I don't know if it qualifies as a restaurant if you are only open for an hour.  Every other BBQ place in central Texas seems to manage being open for more than hour without selling out. This is a small business and a new business, I understand this. But come on. If you sell out in an hour, which has been going on for weeks, you may want to increase your supply. In the five minutes I was there about six other people were turned away. That's a few hundred dollars lost at least. If I hear they get it together enough to have food for more than hour I'll try them and update this review.Update: \\nSomeone got me some of their food. Apparently they leave the sold out sign on when they aren't. The brisket was good the sausage was just okay. All in all I didn't find anything good enough to warrant the hoopla.

Like other Brazilian spots, there is a salad bar/buffet and then a bunch of skewers with grilled meats. Once you load up your plate, you get it weighed and then pay $7/pound. Pretty good deal but keep in mind that a pound adds up pretty quick here.The salad bar/buffet- Not bad, didn't really focus on this since the price is per pound no matter what is on the plate- doesn't make sense to use your ounces on a bunch of rice and beans. That being said, there are a few interesting options here and the plantains and rice were good. The meat- All pretty good, but none of it especially great. All of the meats are very salty which isn't a complaint but a good thing to know heading in. There are about 10 different options to choose from but good luck trying to get a small slice if you are trying to fill your first plate to see what you want to focus on for plate 2.The staff/the vibe- This is one of those places were the staff is really friendly and personable which is cool. There is also a full bar and maybe there aren't a ton in Woburn because it seemed like the hot spot to get a drink or something. DIdn't drink, just ate meat.Overall, I'd say the reviews here are a bit overzealous- its good, and its a fine value, but its not a steal and its not especially awesome.

Hoping it would be a huge platter, turned out to be a small piece of various things. Barely could get a bite on. Most of the meat were dry, didn't have that moist juicy taste to any of the meat.

Their nigiri is definitely chinese influenced hence the warm and mushy rice but they give plenty of topping!

They're delicious?? Check. They have one of the best fried chicken dishes for the price? Check. Oh, well- I'll just add my two cents on my recent dining experience-Came here on a Thursday night around 6:30pm and it was packed. We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table of 3. The parking situation is a bit tricky, but I was able to find a spot after circling a few times. At least they have two rows of booth sitting for those waiting for a table. We ordered--Crispy Fried Buttermilk-Battered Chicken (w/ tasso ham gravy, mashed potatoes & collards) $15.75- WOW! The fried chicken was super crispy and moist, and the skin was really good with the seasoning it had on it. It went well with the mashed potatoes. This plate could have easily fed two people.\\n-Smoked & BBQ'd Beef Brisket (House smoked brisket topped w/ crispy fried onions w/ side of horseradish-bacon potato salad) $15.75- WOW! Also delicious- the brisket was tender, and you could cut through it with your fork. It had a good balance between the fatty and lean pieces, but personally, I wouldn't preferred a higher fat ratio. My other minor criticism is that the potato salad could've used more horseradish.\\n-Screen Door Plate (Choice of 3 house sides and/or local organics & slice of cornbread) $13.95 - We went with one of the specials that night, an arugula salad with walnuts, pears, and blue cheese, then the macaroni & cheese and also bacon & hock collard greens- The salad was good as was the mac & cheese, which was super cheesy and creamy. We accidentally ordered an additional collard greens (it came along w/ the fried chicken), and I don't like collard greens much so I avoided both servings. My friends enjoyed it, so I assume it was good. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the cornbread- disappointing!! It was dry and crumbly and didn't have a good corn taste. However, I just overlooked it and moved onto more yummy items.Overall, we had a TON of leftovers for three girls since each dish can really feed more than 1 person. For the price they charge, you really do get a large quantity of food, and quality food at that.

Great service. What more could you ask for. Oh Pizza!  The pizza was hand tossed and brick oven cooked. I ordered the Margarita Pizza. Visually it was prepared perfectly. The flavor of the crust was a little bland, however, after adding a little salt and garlic it was much better.  My preference was to eat outside. it was around 6pm but none of the outdoor tables were set up for outdoor diners. I had to carry all of the table fixes outside by myself. It was no problem because I really wanted to eat outside, however, I do feel that at least one or two tables should have been prepped outside, or someone from behind the counter could have offered a hand. It was not busy at all and there was no line and no wait. The reason I am giving La Vita 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because they had bottled Aquafina in their Coca Cola cooler. This is just a huge pet peeve of mine and disrespectfully in my opinion. May seem petty but they also have a Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine which likely means that they are getting regular service and support from Coca Cola. Therefore to have a Pepsi product in their Coca-Cola sponsored cooler is bad juju.  It appears that they just ran out of Dasani and found Aquafina to be comparable so they tossed it in the CC cooler. Poor excuse and I feel that this shows bad support of the Coca Cola brand. :( no offense to Pepsi at all.IF that peeve doesn't bother you, definitely go check this place out for real hand tossed, brick oven pizza.

She, being the discerning type, spoke of a Mediterranean establishment of strong Yelp stature, and with modest central Florida prices.  She had my undivided attention.  The GPS adventure to discover Maraya at Sabrina's began.  A difficult trip that involved two U-turns.  Upon arrival on that balmy Sunday night, the appearance was deceiving with only one other vehicle in place.  Dearest ventured in to ensure the establishment was open for service; it was indeed.  Upon entry we were greeted by a caring hostess, waitress, and potential owner.  We enjoyed delicious hummus and the best tabbouleh this culinary couple has ever introduced to our pallets.  Dearest ordered the Kefta Kabob and I enjoyed the lamb.  With a smile, our wonderful hostess introduced us to the delicious entrees, which we devoured between passionate kisses.  We finished with the Kenafa for desert, a delicious cheese dressed in local honey, atop a light custard.  Paired with their Lebanese coffee, it was a finish for royalty.  Certainly a treat for this smitten couple enjoying a Sunday eve.  To top off the fantastic evening, our lovely caretaker indulged us with a small piece of Baklava.  Absolutely decadent. We will certainly enjoy a return trip to enjoy our hostess, the delicious and well priced fare."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh, Sonsie!

Just the right combo of soda, sugar, lime and mint...but they were practically non-alcoholic. Everyone who knows me knows that 3 cocktails will get me pretty well drunk. I housed these things refugee style, and barely left tipsy. So sad.Other than that, things were great.. I loved our carpaccio inspired appetizer, and my sea bass was delicious. Portions are just the right size as well.  I like that the menu is focused and seasonal. If you havent gone for lunch - DO IT. I love the cubano sandwich, and its a great lunchtime value.I was a little puzzled that we were never served bread. Maybe you have to request it now, because of the recession?

I was greeted at the door, she showed me the menu, welcomed us with \\"family friendly\\" and offered a children's menu.  Service got better with Taylor.  It took her a spot of time to get to the table but once here, she was on top of everything!  She paid attention to the drinks that needed refilling and paid attention to my son (smart).  The meal:Started with chili and mac&cheese.  My husband said the chili was good and mac was 4 out of 5 stars.  We had burgers.  We both had the pork belly bacon added (thick and delicious). I loved having Havarti on my burger.   Beef was cooked perfectly (medium and extra well).  I am telling you, the best burger I have had.  I had the zucchini fries.  I wish they had more for the price.  I received about 5 pieces.  They were good but one zucchini is about $.50, so almost $3.00 for those 5 is too much.  My son had the chicken tenders.  Good amount and very tasty.  Taylor was sweet and even added some sprinkles to his end of meal ice cream.We ended with the brownie sundae.  There was nothing special about this.  You could save your $8.Good:The bathroom was very clean.  I know this sounds odd in a review but I have a 2.5 year old, so we visit the bathroom.  I was not weirded out about him using it.Atmosphere: Cool garage bar vibe.  Everyone was friendly.  Place was clean, TVs, etc.  Casual.  Overall, good for what it is.My only complaint:A bit overpriced.  My single burger with cheese and bacon (LTO) and zucchini fries was $18.00.  The bill for 2 adults, 1 child ($8) was almost $75 and that was with only one alcoholic drink ($5).So, if you go and want to watch the budget-skip appetizers, drinks and dessert.I can tell you---I would give this place 5 stars had the cost been a bit more reasonable.

I'm firmly in the former camp, having enjoyed nothing more than a delicious Border Cafe burrito since my high school days nearly 20 years ago. Border has a couple things going for it:1. Fun, casual atmosphere. This is a place where it's totally ok to be loud and have fun with your friends.2. Really inexpensive! Most menu items are under $10 including sides, and very generously sized. In the Boston area, this is a great deal.3. Tasty food. I agree with other reviewers that Border Cafe in no way serves authentic Tex-Mex or Creole food. But that doesn't mean it doesn't taste good! My favorites include the aforementioned burrito, enchilada, and quesadilla, as well as the lemon-pepper chicken. I have several friends who swear by the fish tacos. And if you want a delicious heart attack in a skillet, try the chorizo flambado appetizer. Plus, the hot tortilla chips and salsa served complimentary are usually pretty good too.4. Tasty drinks. Good margaritas, fairly good selection of Mexican beers. If you're not drinking alcohol, the soft drinks are ENORMOUS with free refills.5. The crowd. This location of Border (as opposed to the one on Rt. 1) caters more to the college and young professional crowd. While you do see kids at lunchtime, the evening crowd is primarily grown up. The Rt. 1 location caters to families and has helium balloons, coloring books, etc. I appreciate the more grown-up atmosphere here.6. Even waits are not usually ridiculous. They don't take reservations and so yes, I've had to wait to be seated, sometimes as long as 45 minutes if I'm with a bigger group. But you can always snag a delicious margarita at the bar, pop over to the Starbucks across the street for a pre-dinner coffee, or window shop at some of the stores on Church St. (not too far or your beeper will be out of range). I also find they usually seat you before the estimate provided.On the negative side, parking is tough (but that's why God invented the T!). Is this gourmet food?

It is a quasi shotgun style establishment, narrow but not really that long. There were asses and elbows flying along the bar. I need my sustained perimeter, but it was constantly breached.

If you're like me, this space isn't for you.Right, the food. My burger wasn't very good. The patty's diameter was probably approaching 2 inches larger than that of the bun. The taste was nothing special. The shoestring fries were absolutely micro. It just didn't work. The beers were very good and my bartender was nice.

Presentation and service was very good as well.My only suggestion to management would be to improve the beer selection. Since 'beer is in' these days - I'd get a few more good craft beers.

It was flawless in every way. Flawless.Our server and our service was impeccable. Period. Once drinks were served - and they pour a good drink here - versus the many places in Atlanta that skimp - we asked our server to pick appetizers for us. The crab cakes were the best I've had outside of Baltimore in 40 years. As a Baltimore boy, I know crab cakes. If I had been by myself, I'd have licked the plate when I was finished. Some pretension of having some couth was called for but next time all bets are off. We also had a chilled shrimp appetizer, one with pulled bbq pork and fried green tomatoes. Please see previous comments on plate licking. The portions were generous and the presentation and quality was exceptional.Some people then had a peach salad that was mostly inhaled rather than chewed. I had the she crab soup - please see previous comments on plate licking. Perfection. Entrees included quail, trout, pork chop, hanger steak, and again, without exception, everyone loved their meal. Good size portions, fresh quality ingredients, well-prepared and well-presented. You all know how I dislike trendiness and affectation. There was none here. Everything looked as good as it tasted and there was no foody pretension.These people understand hospitality and deliver it in the old-school way. You even get fresh clean flatware between courses rather than having used and dirty utensils placed back on the table or left on your bread plate. Kudos to management. This is the way a fine meal should be served. Service was attentive without being intrusive. It was all done right.It you have drinks, appetizer, soup or salad, and entree - we were all too full for dessert - plan on spending roughly $75-100/head. As cheap as I am, let me tell you it will be worth every damned dime.Whether for business or pleasure, holiday or special occasion, or you just want a really good meal that is delivered in a comfortable and attractive setting, with immaculate service and great value for price paid, do not miss South City Kitchen."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I've been going to this place for over two years that I have been studying nearby.

For example, when ordering enchilada I always order rice and beans, but can never predict just how spicy it is going to be. At one point it had no spice at all, but on my most recent visit I could barely eat it and had to ask for a replacement dish. The waiter was very nice and did replace the order without charging us for the price, so that's definitely a plus. Best advice: ask the waiter/waitress how spicy a particular dish on that particular day in advance."},{"name":"Jimoco Cafe & Pasta","address":"1046 Austin Avenue, Suite A","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"This is a nice local spot.

I like how the ingredients are matched, such as how the sweetness of the pancake was reduced by some bacon crumbs on top and a side of fruits with jam.\\nThe dishes are a little oily, but it is great for a lazy yet wanna get slightly fancier brunch morning. \\nI say I enjoy this more than the usual brunch menu like pancakes and omelettes.

I sat down at a table and waited 18 minutes for my food. At first glance the food looked delicious but after my first bite I'm sorry to say I was mistaken. The salad was old the mash potatoes  were cold and the fish was salty and overcooked. Sad to say the best thing on the plate was brown rice and even that was bland.

They're open from 11am - 1pm, so it's better to arrive well before the opening time.  A group of us arrived at 10am (this is a Thursday), and the line was already about 35+.  We were prepared and brought a cooler full of ice and sodas, so we grabbed a picnic table and chatted while we waited for the place to open up.  During that time, Hungry Todd came over with his camera crew to talk to us.  After learning that all five of us had never been to Franklin before, he told us all about the magical flavors that we were about to experience, and reminded us to not fill up on bread.Before we knew it, it was time to get up and stand in line.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after the doors opened before we were able to order.  We got 1.5 pounds of brisket (both lean and fatty), a pound of ribs, half a pound of pulled pork, and a pint of potato salad.  It all came out to 50 bucks, which is pretty good for a large meal for five.  Hungry Todd's plate looked about the same size as ours did, and he was eating it all himself.  God Bless America.  The brisket is delicious beyond words.  The fatty side is pure decadence and warm, gooey, tender meaty nirvana.  The lean side is not anywhere near as fun, but still pretty damn tasty.  The ribs are excellent...perfectly smoked, and fall-off-the-bone tender.  The pulled pork was great too, but it was certainly overshadowed by the brisket and ribs.  We didn't get to try the sausage this time, so maybe next time.The sauces are quite good too.  Barbecue isn't about the sauce, but it's nice to have some.  At least that's what Hungry Todd said, and I agree.  The smokey flavor of the meats were great all on their own, but the sauces did add a bit of extra flavor.  The espresso bean sauce was different and delicious.  The vinegar sauce was tangy and a perfect match for the pulled pork.  My favorite was the sweet sauce, and I poured it all over my ribs. so arrive at 10, wait and hour for opening, finally sit down and eat a 11:45.   Totally worth it.  If you love barbecue, you owe it to yourself to give Franklin a try.  Awesomely amazing.

The 3rd time, she told us we needed to decide quickly b/c the restaurant was going to get crowded (and yes, it did) and if we didn't order now, the food would come out slow. Too bad she couldn't tell us in a more courteous way - decided it was just cultural :)My friend & I were hesitant about the \\"basil squid\\" at first, only b/c Kit mentioned that the baby squids were whole. However, decided to forego that fear, after all, we're Korean and whole squids shouldn't be all that foreign to us. And glad we did! What a savory dish - loved it! But loved the \\"basil chicken\\" more (which I got during my 1st visit here). During our meal, the squid got way overcooked, dry, & even crispy due to the retained heat from the stone pot. The \\"Chinese okra with golden mushrooms\\" (which were really Enoki mushrooms) was comforting but disappointingly bland ... by itself. However, it complemented well with the strong & bold flavors of the basil squid.  Probably won't order this dish again though.Restaurant was packed tonight - and crowd was pretty diverse. Different from our first visit on Mother's Day when the crowd was all Chinese & Taiwanese. Definitely recommend coming early if you want your food to come out in a reasonable time.

The atmosphere is rustic and fun.This is one of my favorite spots to take my German family visiting, because it's about as big of a culture shock as one can muster in Atlanta and give them a feel for REAL BBQ.  The wait can be an issue.  Be prepared to wait.  Reservations would be awesome, but alas... you will be standing around having a beer or two while you wait to be seated.  The parking situation is also a mess. I don't even try anymore to park in the designated parking lot, but instead just park in the neighborhood streets.If you're one of those people who thinks BBQ = grilling.... please come here and get an education on real BBQ.

I used to frequent this location back in 2009 and 2010 when it was Seito Sushi.  I had not been since it made the transition to Ari, but a friend of mine suggested it so we decided to check it out last night.  \\nWe met at 6pm and the place was dead.  There was 1 table outside and maybe 2 inside.  We were seated promptly and given our choice of where to sit.  It was a really nice night so we chose a large table outside on the patio.  \\nOur server Eunice showed up right away and got us all waters.  We all ordered sake tails.  I ordered the Pom Pom which was pomegranate, sweet and sour, and sake.  It was fine, but not spectacular.  My girlfriend had one with sake, pineapple juice, and vanilla.  It was delicious.  I would get that one next time.  Her husband had a sake Long Island Iced Tea.  My man had plum wine.  The plum wine was not on the menu anywhere that we could find, but someone had posted a picture of it on Yelp, so we knew to ask for it.  The drinks were reasonably priced around $5-$6.  \\nSo, I don't eat fish, which leads you to ask, why come to a sushi place?  My fianc√© loves seafood.  My girlfriend is vegan and they have some options for her, and honestly I usually love Bento boxes.  I've never had a problem eating at a sushi restaurant between the edamame, gyoza, ginger salad, miso soup, kalbi, bulgogi, katsu, and teriyaki.  Sushi restaurants usually have great options for those of us who don't eat seafood.  Ari is no exception.  They had most if not all of the items I just mentioned.  Here's the thing though, I'm not totally sure what they had because it seems that they have things that are not on the menu.  For example, we could not find the plum wine on the menu anywhere, but they had it.  I saw people with edamame on their table and I saw pictures of it on Yelp, but I did not see it on the menu.  I really wanted some gyoza, which was on the lunch menu, but completely missing from the dinner menu.  \\nI ordered chicken teriyaki which came with rice, vegetables, and my choice of soup or salad.  I received a ginger salad which I loved.  Ginger dressing is one of my favorite dressings ever.  It was the dressing that convinced me to eat salad as a kid.  But, then my entr√©e came out.  First of all, the teriyaki was on the side.  No problem.  I usually like stuff on the side.  Here's the problem though, the chicken was so bland and completely lacking in any flavor at all.  It most definitely needed to be marinated in the teriyaki.  I kid you not, this was the worst chicken I ever ate in my life.  It was tough.  It was chewy.  It was almost rubber like, and again ZERO flavor.  I ate about 3 pieces hoping it would get better, or it was just the ends, but no.  It was absolutely awful.  I ate my sticky rice.  My fianc√© said he knew it was bad when they offered me a to go box and I said no.  The worst part is that chicken teriyaki was $17!  Even if it was good that would be a high price to pay for what I received.  \\nSo let's see, absolute worst chicken I ever had in my life.  Overpriced chicken, and missing menu items equals a one star experience for me.  I didn't even mentioned the bugs that bit everyone's ankles, but I guess that's our own fault for eating outside.  \\nHowever, I am giving this place 2 stars because I am the only one who had a negative experience and therefore it is possible I just ordered the absolute wrong thing.  My man loved his sashimi.  He was super pleased with his order and ate every bite.  My friend loved her veggies and her husband enjoyed his rolls.  The drinks were good and reasonable.  This raises it up to a 2 star review."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"What else is there to say?  Best BBQ in Atlanta.

We stopped by at 7 PM on a Tuesday for a drink or two, and it was just the right amount of patrons where we were able to grab seats at the bar but didn't feel like it was a ghost town (perfect for really enjoying this type of bar IMO). The atmosphere in general really appeals to me: there's a cool, vintagey, comfortable speakeasy vibe, with dark lighting and cozy armchairs, a place you could easily hang out for hours in and/or have a romantic tryst or two.Our bartender was excellent: attentive, friendly, obviously skilled with drink-crafting, and a big fan of W&N (he was raving about the food). The two drinks I had, the Susan and the Maude, were both excellent (and worth every $12 penny, unlike other places out there that charge $14+ for crappy drinks). The Susan in particular made my tastebuds sing: who knew strawberry and walnut went so well together? Total epiphany. The boy's drinks were also delicious.We decided to get some small bites to eat as well, particularly because the menu sounded really interesting and the bartender was singing the chefs' praises. The pork belly arancini were exactly what an arancini should be IMO: crisp and golden on the outside, creamy and flavorful on the inside, with some tasty 'sauce' (fiddlehead puree) for dipping. The 'potato skins' were basically plain thin potato wedges with an aioli dipping sauce, not what I had expected but still pretty tasty. As much as I love the whole gourmet/in season/local ingredient jazz and respect the chefs' reputation (Whisk pop-ups and all that), I did think the food prices were really on the high side ($11 for 3 small balls and $8 for like 2 potatoes worth of wedges), so I don't know that I'd be able to afford to come here specifically for dinner- it's fun to try one or two small plates alongside a delicious cocktail, but that's it. This place seems to have mixed reviews from the Yelp crowd, so I say try checking it out off-hours; you'll be able to cozy up to the bar, chat with the bartenders, and whittle away a night of delicious cocktails in a comfy seat without having to worry about crowds or slow service."},{"name":"Relish","address":"6637 SE Milwaukie Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Immediately felt at home.

Overall, food was ok, and I was a bit disappointed that this restaurant follows a new trend where the appetizers & desserts are better than the entrees. Ambiance & Service: Had a nice atmosphere and good service, although the lady who was helping our main server (who was very friendly) was not as polished. 3 starsAppetizers & Drinks: Nothing to rave about. We had crab cakes, vegetable succotash, and fried green tomatoes, the latter of which was pretty good. Not a very huge selection of non-alcoholic drinks, so I grabbed a cranberry juice. I think they have a few juices and sodas. 2 starsEntrees & Sides: Apparently the steak is from Creekstone Farms which is halal, so that was great. My husband tried the steak which was juicy, but the flavors could have been more on point. I had the Georgia trout which was awful. There was just no flavor. The beans and corn under the fish were good, but I pretty much left the fish as it was. The sides were ok. The best side was mac-n-cheese, but how can you go wrong with that? The garlic beans were ok. 2 starsDessert: If it was not for the dessert, I would have given this place two stars. The pecan pie with vanilla ice cream was on point. Others in our party had the honeysuckle gelato and the banana pudding and everyone loved their dessert!

We tried one of the republic mules and an apple old fashioned first and really enjoyed them both. They have some creative twists and common cocktails all across their menu, many of which looked worth trying but vary from $8-10 meaning the tab adds up fast. The tots were not what we were expecting, only about 6 of them, fried well with a tasty ranch sauce but ultimately we would have loved a basket of them. For dinner he got the Chicken friend beef cheeks since the server recommended it for chicken fried steak fans and she tried the ribs on account of them not always being on the menu. The beef cheeks had a nice fry on them and came with some tasty mashers. The twist was that it also came with some surprisingly spicy hot sauce that caught a couple of us off guard.The ribs were probably the better of the two with a fall off the bone texture and a yummy bbq sauce. For our sides, the fries were a food addition to any plate and the asparagus were fine though none of us cared for the egg that came on top. Overall we had a very enjoyable experience at Mettle even if the service was a little spotty and too relaxed (forgot one of our drinks entirely but ended up comping it at the end which was a nice make up move).We will likely go back for the outdoor patio which provides a quieter escape from the hectic downtown restaurants.

The restaurant was busy and had a great vibe. I was at first concerned that we wouldn't be able to speak to each over the sound of the other diners, but that turned out not to be the case.We spent a good 2-3 hours catching up, and enjoying a few cocktails and several dishes (which we shared). Everything was delicious, but the really \\"wow\\" plates were the fluke ceviche and the duck confit. And the cauliflower! My feeling is that you really can't go wrong ordering here. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helped us choose cocktails- all excellent.\\nAlso, I noticed that other reviewers commented on the price/size of dishes. I don't know if Tapestry has changed anything since those reviews were posted, but I spent much less than I expected. I think we ordered 4 cocktails each and around 7 sharing plates. It ended up being around $100 each.

The pralines do come off easy if you try to cut it with a knife. The chicken and waffles were one of the best traditional chicken and waffles Ive had. The chicken was crispy and moist, while the waffle was lightly crispy and had a great sweet potato flavor.  The banana foster french toast was one of the best Ive ever had. Ive had others that may have had more charisma in certain aspects, but pound for pound every aspect was on point. The texture is firm yet soft. The banana rum flavor is so delicious while not being overly sweet. The bananas were soft but not mushy. Every bite was delicious from beginning to end. I ended up using the banana foster syrup over my chicken and waffles at some point. At the end of the meal, I was blissfully comatose from all the bread, fat, and sugar I had.

And (ATTENTION OWNERS), if you are going to charge, please train your waitstaff to inform customers that it is not complimentary so they can make an informed decision about saying \\"yes\\" to the question: \\"Would you like some chips and salsa?\\" It's not the amount you charge, but the principal of it appearing unannounced on the bill. Also, please train your manager(s) to at least pretend they care when a customer informs them that they're unhappy with something. Even if they're blowing smoke up our ass, a simple \\"I'm so sorry to hear that.

The crowd here is varied from young couples to aging hipsters and members of the Women's League.  Everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves and downstairs it was a little noisy, but in a good busy Saturday kind of way.I enjoyed a tasty Bloody Mary made with Tito's Vodka and featuring not 1 but 3 olives.  I guess I looked hungry.  As I looked over the varied menu, I noticed several plates featuring such Southern vernaculars as cheese grits, shrimp & grits, and pimento and cheese.  There is also brisket Benedict and crab cakes.  Pretty much a wide enough menu to please both southerner and carpetbagger.After a moments hesitation, I chose the pimento and cheese plate with celery, house made benne crackers and bread and butter pickles.  The plate is presented with the pimento and cheese served in an open jelly jar, with a stack of pickles and crackers obscuring the celery.  Half of the celery promptly was expropriated for use in bloody Mary's.  The benne crisps are firm enough to stand up to the pimento and can hold enough to be crude, if one chooses.  The bread and butter pickles are house made, too.  If you are from the school of dull innocuous pimentos, this is not your dish.  It has a wonderful bouquet of sharp cheddar with undertones of Texas Pete's hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  It is spicy to taste but does not burn.My main dish was the chicken and waffles.  The waffle is a golden malt type of sweet lite waffle.  Slightly crisp but with a soft golden center.  The syrup is an almost thin lite syrup with hints of cane juice and a color that can be described as a golden tone.  The chicken is fried and per our server is brined in buttermilk.  It is sweetly flavorful.  The crispy batter on the chicken is slightly spicy and perfectly applied.  It has some sage, salt, pepper, onion powder and cayenne in it.  It's a great contrast to the syrup and waffle.The meal was not too cheap and I had a bit of chocolate cake for dessert.

I know what I like (veggie brats, veggie chili, tater tots and pretzels) and I've had every non-beef item on the menu.Their cheese sauce is the exact same kind you find in your elementary school cafeteria, and that is a good thing. Sriracha mustard? They did it first. Alcoholic slushies? Get out, DF's been doing that for years. Sweet local art on the walls?

The chips & salsa are the tits, and the food is really good and well priced overall. I've frequented the Harvard Square & Burlington locations quite often and will continue to go back frequently.I suppose when I think about packaging it altogether though, the service truly is sub-par for the most part.  Both locations are quite large, so it feel like the wait staff may be a bit on the short end in terms of service.  I'm pretty big on the service aspects of a place, but again, I love the food, so I'm going to let it slide.The biggest drawback has to be the weak margaritas. You get one of those giant, thick glasses and think it's going to be a fountain of joy, but just ends up being 1 splash of tequila mixed in with a high concentration of mix & ice.That said, I do truly love the enchiladas & fajitas.

To me, those places represented the best that bbq can offer.  Then I went to Franklin. I heard everyone talk about how great Franklin was and I was highly skeptical...at least in the sense that I couldn't see how this bbq was actually that much better than places like Louie Mueller, Black's, etc . After waiting for 1.5 hours, that skepticism immediately went away.Experience: I really enjoy the experience of going to Franklin.  I've been 4 times now and you get there early and wait in a line that snakes up the drive, to the stairs and back up and down a ramp to the front door.  It's always an eclectic group ranging from lawyers in suits, college kids, the whole bit.  Once you are up the ramp near the front door, the anticipation rises.  Then you get in and you realize you have another 30 minutes to wait.  I personally did not mind the entire waiting process but I know that some people would.  The inside table area is pretty small but they do a good job of policing things so that folks don't just come in and sit down at a table while their party waits.  Every time I have been, we have always sat at an inside table.  When I reached the counter, I found Aaron Franklin (owner and pit master) cutting the meats.  He could not have been nicer.  He cut off a small piece of brisket for me to sample and the rest is history.   Meats:  On all of my trips, I keep it simple with a 2 meat plate of brisket (fatty cut) and pork ribs.  The brisket was honestly on another level it was so amazing.  It's hard to describe really.  I also like that he makes thick cuts of the brisket.  Awesome stuff.  The pork ribs were also some of the best I have had.  Great flavor.  Sides: I always have potato salad and beans and they were good here.  Nothing spectacular but you don't come here for the sides.  Overall:  This is by far the best bbq that I have ever had.  Aaron Franklin is doing something special here.  The wait is well worth it.  Can't wait to go back.  On each trip when I am finished, I look across to whoever is with me and tell them, \\"let's get going, time to let another person experience Franklin\\"."},{"name":"Pollo Bravo","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave, Ste 10","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Days later and I am still thinking about the fragrant, crispy chicken.

Last thing is that I love how accommodating and friendly everyone at this place is.

The classic 50s looking diner has a bar that is exactly where the kitchen is. It's open and you can see everyone hustling and working their bottom off!This one is a bit small.

Their cocktails are solid and the concept is great.

When the guac comes out before your drinks, it's a clear sign that it either is store bought or made long before it is to be served. The hot sauce selection is good and the service is also solid. But they fall short where it matters most. It's not too late to save this place but they may need to reassess what they value. Guacamole is a staple of Mexican cuisine and if you're going to charge seven dollars, I expect that it at least be made to order. I also don't want to mix the tomato and onion in myself.

I am surprised that no one has mentioned the house sake here. at $3 a pop, u get a small pitcher full of freezing cold DELICIOUS sake. granted, the atmosphere is not encouraging you to sit and stay awhile, but I had no problem drinking the whole thing before I was done with my meal. it is LOUD as crap in this joint.

Balance was really only achieved on the charred broccoli (very good) and the crab (also good).  The rest didn't really hit the mark: The carrots were oversalted and greasy, the crudo was underwhelming in flavors, and the bluefish suffered from too much salt and a soggy, unrefreshing slaw.  The service was prompt: the waiter stopped by multiple times and our water cups were always full. They also offered pickled green beans which were excellent and refilled it upon request.

It was piled with lots of crab and shrimp, so it was suitable for a dinner portion.  Other fish looked pretty good too, and the accompanying sourdough was very good.  We skipped the apparently famous crawfish, however.  Prices are a bit high, so we didn't add on any extras, choosing instead to go for gelato for dessert.

Pushing my pondering of the eatery's name aside, my chopped beef brisket, placed atop a slice of white bread, blew my taste buds away with its juiciness, spiciness and tenderness. The mac-n-cheese (shells mixed with melted white cheese and a sufficient layer of solidified orange on top) quickly vanished, while I chose to more carefully savor my collard greens.

Even though the tablecloth looked like my friend took a caveman for lunch, I did clumsily try to use the chopsticks, but some of the pieces of dim sum were big and hard to maneuver.   The right thing would have been to leave my business card to pay for the ensuing cleaners' bill to clean the white tablecloth.  I mean no extra strength Tide will take care of the mess I made; that cloth is going to need to be dry cleaned.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food at Hei La Moon contrary to what one might think by looking at half of the food I left scattered on the tablecloth. The place works out well for a large group and also has some smaller tables but it's definitely not the type of place to have a romantic dinner with wine, flowers, and such as the noise level is quite high.  The service is great as you just tell the staff what you would like off the cart carrying multiple types of dim sum. My friend did the ordering, and all the dim sum was delicious and flavorful. I even had a chance to try chicken feet but that might have been the only choice that I was not a fan as it was simply too much work for so little nourishment.  For dessert, I had the small bean paste roll with coconut on the outside and mango center.  The coconut provided a nice texture and was not overpowering, so that you also could enjoy the taste of the mango inside.  The entire meal was only $28 dollars between the two of us.  I would highly recommend Hei La Moon for dim sum; just next time I might bring my own fork or newspaper to cover the table for extra food stain protection."},{"name":"Tacodeli","address":"4200 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite taco shops for sure.

It needs a serious overhaul.My friends from Cincinnati came to visit, and have all been to the original Dirty Frank's. Every one of us loves the downtown location, and every one of us was disappointed with the Westgate location.We went this past Saturday with a party of seven. I had to make a loop around the block, because I drove right past this place. The building it's in has a large sign for a martial arts class on the East side, so it's unclear that there might be a restaurant next door.Our party walked in, and the hostess told us to sit anywhere. Once she realized there were many of us, she changed her mind. \\"I guess I can get some tables together.\\" Wow. That didn't seem very professional. While we were waiting, I took a look around. The art is a similar style to the downtown location, but much more sparsely laid out. The walls feel a bit empty, even though they aren't. Is this still Dirty Frank's?It felt a bit loud inside, especially considering that the place wasn't that busy. The music was a bit overwhelming because our server had trouble hearing us, and vice versa.Also, the floor was very slick and seemed cheaply made. In a few spots it was buckling. Instead of our server bringing our food, the hostess brought it. This is fine, except she only recognized about half of the dogs, and asked us what certain plates were. You work here, not us! Maybe she didn't, actually, because she spent most of the night at the bar chatting.The food was a mixed bag. My Hot Bollywood was perfect,  and exactly the quality I'd expect. Things were looking better, until I tried the Westgate dog. Topped with soft pretzels that were very stale and chewy. Gross. However, the actual soft pretzels my wife and I ordered were awesome. Just like downtown. The tater tachos (deluxe) seemed normal, until we realized the cheese was underneath everything. Is that normal? All toppings on top, except cheese. That's weird.My friends didn't have a good time, and now I feel like a fool for not vetting this place before taking them.I will do due diligence and give it another shot sometime, but not until it's received a management shakeup.

My friends rave about this place, so perhaps  I hit it on a bad day, or wasn't in the right mood or something. I'm also pretty sure that the fact that I am pescatarian didn't help (they don't speak much english and everything seems to have pork in it.) The cart system didn't seem to be set up very well- they hardly ever came by and we kept getting the same ones. A glass of water would have been nice too- my drink was gone quickly and we never saw the drink cart again, leaving me extra thirsty with all the sodium rich food. We also had a really hard time getting soy sauce- had to ask about 6 people before it finally came.When all was said and done, all we ended up eating were a ton of dumplings and some bao. I would have liked to try other things, but like i said, the carts never seemed to come by, so we just kept ending up with the same dumplings and not much else.

Normally, it also includes cream cheese but you can opt out of that (which we did).When I read their menu, I got fixated on the Zimmer ($10.75) because it was served on marble rye... love marble rye!The Zimmer includes sliced avocado, sprouts, cheese sauce, and a soft poached egg (cue the runny yolk picture).

Since we were in Applebee's during the week we decided it had to be Panera or Olive Garden. While walking my wife said she wanted Olive Garden, i was thinking more in Panera but since she's the lady Olive Garden won. I was happy anyway, i like OG.We sat down and put the baby stroller instead of a chair between my wife and i, the waiter comes take the order and leave, after 5 minutes he comes with 3 drinks, we're two, puts the 3rd drink on the table and then he realize is not for anyone so he take it away, while he does that i ask him for some breadsticks and salad.When the food comes he brings everything together, entrees and appetizers, i'm not a genius but aren't the appetizers supposed to come first to start your dinners? anyway, i finish my drink and the guy pass 3 or 4 times and i have to ask someone else for a refill, 10 minutes into the dinner he comes and said i'll bring you some breadstick, hummm, really, breadsticks? now?When he comes with the breadsticks he go with the basket over my baby stroller to put it on the table, again, really? your passing food over a 3 months baby's head?Finally he see that we have finish with the entrees and appetizer (no need to say that some plates were empty for more than 10 minutes on the table) , my glass was empty but he never noticed that, he ask me if i would like the check... and then he think about it for a second and ask if we want some dessert, no thank you just the check.The check gets to the table i put my credit card and i have to call someone because apparently he forgot that he have to pick up the bill and see if we need change or maybe he needs to swipe the card.Guess what!! he comes with my card and the boucher WITHOUT A PEN!!!!!! For me the fastest way to get out of there was head to the lobby and ask for a pen, sign the dam thing and get out of there, leaving a note: IS HE NEW?. That was the only reason i could find to get that kind of service.Again, it's sad, the only other time we were in that particular Olive Garden the girl that serve us was really nice, full of joy and she loved my baby, talked to everyone on the table and was very aware of our needs.Maybe we'll go back one day but with Applebee's and Panera right next door we'll think twice before going in.By the way, we never got the salad."},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"A few things:\\n1.

With all that said, I can't eat decor and there's no amount of atmosphere that can make up for sub-par food.I ordered their \\"secret burger\\" which was labeled with the enticing phrase \\"limited availability\\" on their menu.  That means it has to be good, right?  Why would the availability of something bad be so limited?  That's what I and about half of my dinner companions thought.  Long story short, it was one of the saltiest burgers I've ever eaten.  I have this theory that the key difference between high-end food and low-end food is how well they hide fat, salt, and sugar.  Fast food chains tend to be really in-your-face about it,  their burger buns sickeningly soggy with grease.  Good restaurants find a way to squeeze in just as many calories and guilt-inducing ingredients, but they're more subtle about it.  There was nothing subtle about my meal at Alden & Harlow.I also tried my friend's order of chicken fried rabbit.

After waiting, we ordered food and I ordered a cappuccino. This is when things start getting awful. The other waitresses are obviously running food and drinks for everyone.

A different waitress asked about 4 tables if my cappuccino belonged to them before just taking it back to where the drinks are made. I did eventually get my cappuccino. \\nNext, our food was taken to 2 different tables and actually set down at the people right next to us.

For desert, I discovered banana pudding, something else I've forsaken in the south. It was okay, as deserts go. I've never had banana pudding before, so I have nothing to compare it to.

That crowd knows what they like!\\nIt's a simple concept, uncomplicated, but with superior quality - you get their basic, excellent bowl of Ramen with your choice of additives. Other than a few very interesting appetizers, these people offer only Ramen - but they do it very well! \\nWe enjoyed the Saut√©d Curry Brussels Sprouts appetizer very much. I thought I was very creative, but these people came up with what amounts to fried brussels sprouts - saut√©d without batter, by the way - with just the right amount of curry spice.

In my usual search for delicious hot 'n' spicy food, I had to get my Ramen with Fire in the Bowl, a concentrated paste that demands a warning from me - yes, me, can you believe it? Fire in the Bowl is not for the casual spicy food hobbyist - it is serious business, so you best be careful with it. Luckily, they serve it on the side in a little bowl, and you can control how much goes in your Ramen. Many of you will find there is enough there for everyone at your table to get spiced up with just the one serving. Of course, I went for the full effect, but left behind a small amount - just to be prudent on my first visit. Next time, I'm dumping the whole thing in there!\\nThe only caveat is the long line and shortage of tables, which, of course, are a kind of symbiotic relationship. Do a small number of tables cause the long line? Or, does the long line cause a shortage of tables? I must say \\"yes\\", but it's all because of the excellent, high quality food.

The signature dish for the food competition was a Pulled Pork Crostini with Grits- Braised pulled pork served with smokey cheddar southern grits and garnished with caramelized onions, fennel pickles, toasted sesame seeds, and a fried egg.It has taken me two days to put my thoughts in order to craft this review. I would just like to say that this was the most sophisticated flavor profile of the entire 40+ trailer/truck competition by a large factor. And if you've read my review of Celia's Cheesecake Experience you know that I have encountered some layered, ingenious, remarkably clever culinary creations during this festival. This was a dish of such subtlety and art that it almost had no right to be served in an adorable paper tray. I would serve this to a condemned man as his last meal with a conscience as clear as a spring day. I would serve this mean on the finest bone china imported from the master craftsmen of Asia and it would be done it's proper due. This was an experience that deserves the full attention of far greater culinary minds and educations than my own. A meal that should be brought before the city as an example of what can and should be possible for a township to become a great culinary name on the map of the world. I have only the highest regard for this dish and I regret that I do not posses a finer vocabulary and greater depth of education to be able to express to you what I was given here.Let me start by saying that braised pulled pork was, as it must be, tender, moist, flavorful, full of character, present and expressive. Throughout the meal it was the titan Atlas that carried on it's shoulders the world that was dishes other ingredients. The smoky cheddar southern grits were, transcending the low-born roots of the ingredient, a rich and magnificent ambassador passing through every aspect of the dish and supporting and introducing every flavor of the journey. And I, being from Chicago originally cannot call myself a Southern Man in that traditional sense that grits might be the food of my people. I have until this meal, largely discounted grits as an element of regional southern cuisine that, while integral to the tradition of the great food of Dixieland, was by no means a relevant element of the composition any more that white rice is other dishes. Here, I was shown my error. Truly the grits were as essential to the composition of this plate as the temperature,  and the pork. The entire plate was only complimented and indeed, bound by it's surprising and noteworthy flavor.The caramelized onions and fennel pickles, spread throughout the fork-fulls were always a pleasant and welcome burst of smooth, savory glory and rich, briny spicy seasoned high notes that enlivened and brought spirit to the dish wherever encountered. This dish would suffer without the onions such that no matter how averse to onions you might be, I urge you to reconsider their value and worth as a key and crucial element in a flawless overall design.There are two more absolutely imperative points that I must bring up regarding this meal. The first is that I am OVER this trend of putting a fried egg on every damn thing in god's creation. So many well-meaning, trend-conscious chefs will flop a questionably sous-chef cooked egg of varying degrees of quality and skill-at-pan onto your meal with a mind for this new practice, but it is so often that the egg is poorly executed and the addition only mars an otherwise well-composed plate in my opinion. NOT SO HERE! The egg that I was served was cooked to a breathtaking perfection. It was the kind of magnificence that reminds one of how food in television commercials always looks so impossibly idealized in its perfection. The egg's white was soft and gelid in a positive way, hot and ready to fall apart at the touch of the fork without a hint of toughness or that leatheriness that an overcooked egg is so quick to take on. And the yolk. The yolk was cooked perfectly though half of it's mass, bright yellow as a fresh lemon and the remaining half, smooth and creamy as it ran into the grits and pork and coated with a never-slimy, but solidly rich and amazing glaze. It was transcendence. It was all that the fried egg on top tradition ever promised to be and more. So perfectly matched was the yolk's rich flavor against the cheesy grits that I regretted my low opinion of the friend egg addition in the past. And the final word, The Roasted Sesame Seeds. If you found yourself asking, \\"what are those doing in there?\\" well so did I. And I have to express in full disclosure now that they were the masters touch. Seriously. They subtle, tiny bursts of that kind of burnt-smoky seed flavor they lent to this rich discourse were like minuscule gasps of illumination. Like moments of culinary clarity made manifest in the present sense-clouding nirvana of delirious flavorful joy."},{"name":"Maraya At Sabrina's Restaurant","address":"8100 Crystal Clear Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I became a Yelper just a few days ago and decided to give credit where credit has been long overdue.\\nI travel a lot and was lucky enough to discover Maraya at Sabrina's  restaurant in Orlando that I considered a well kept secret. \\nI've been on a moderate low crab diet for many years, but never felt comfortable eating red meat loaded with hormones and unhealthy chemicals.

Christopher's, however, disproves this point. They're one block from Porter and are one of the ass-kickingist bars/restaurants in Porter Square.There's plenty of seating at the bar and around the restaurant-- don't forget the upstairs. Service is friendly. The menu is pretty extensive, and most importantly, NOT expensive. You can do well for yourself for $15-20 here, which is not common for a sit-down restaurant in Cambridge. Culinary highlights include the Brussels sprouts with bacon and cheese, chicken panini, veggie burger (though I am not yet comfortable calling it the best veg burger in the area), and fries of all types. They've also got a great beer list with a sizeable list of rotating specials.Ultimately, in an era when limited-selection menus and small plates are the trend, Christopher's provides a welcome respite to those who prefer choice and bigger portions in an unpretentious, cozy space.

It saus on the menu that its \\"the best in Boston\\" boy, do I believe it! Hands down the best chicken amd waffles I have ever had. That waffle (though a bit small. Aparently you can order an extra if you want) was absolutely wicked. Purely insane! The texture, density, and flavor are nuts. It almost seemed like the waffle was lightly deep fried after it was cooked, to create the perfectly firm outer bits and deliciously moist soft insides. The chicken that comes with it must be the most tender chicken I have ever had, falling off the bone like you would not believe and perfectly crunchy batter crust. I asked for some hot sauce to go with it, as I always like that mix of sweet and spicy with chicken and waffles. I didn't use any, because it didnt need it, it was already perfect.Drinks and the bread putting for desert were also suitably delicious but nothing can top that chicken and waffles so I will just stop there.This place is now a must visit any time I am in Boston.Thanks again Peter and Asia! \\n-John"},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm from San Francisco, too, but can't pretend to know good dim sum from Mr. Chau's, having only been to The City's greatest on elementary school trips.What I can say is that I went here a few weeks ago with a best friend, and we over-ordered from the appetizer cart, and couldn't identify most of the things we ate, but loved it all, didn't feel especially pressured by the waitresses despite being part of a very small minority of non-Chinese speakers on a Saturday around noon (and they had everything left that we would have wanted).

I did enjoy it a lot, although I do wish I got the beef tongue tacos instead. Maybe the taco's deconstructed plating won me over but I got to taste the meat and was very pleased. In terms of my dish, while it was good, I do feel like they skimped out on the pork belly portion a bit and also that the pork belly wasn't thaaat crispy. They also didn't give me enough lettuce wraps so I had to get some from my friends. Not a big issue, so it's still a good dish.As for my other friends' dishes, miso aioli on the fries made fries worth getting. Cured salmon looked nice but was so small in portion you would probably still be starving afterwards (or at least I would).

I wore a jacket and was afraid it would fall into the plates of diners who were unfortunate enough to draw the door straw. My last gripe about the wait, they asked if we wanted to get started on our drinks as we milled around. I didn't come to SE to drink in a doorway. I do that at home.But for the stars that aren't lacking in this review; the ambiance was better once my partner and I sat down. The small focused menu was a boost of confidence in the kitchens ability to execute the dishes, and we weren't let down. We started with a fun and unique pickled herring. But this place is known for the mussels. The Korean flavored dish was honest and true to its origin, served with kimchi and subtle miso notes it was a tantalizing taste I'd recommend to all Asian food enthusiasts.  The mussels were cooked with care that definitely kept the integrity and quality well above par. We didn't get there early enough to get any Bread Pudding for dessert, but it thrilled me to know it was prepped and ready for a handful of 'first come first serve' and not massed produced with some left over to be served the next day or thrown away.The only thing we didn't get from our server, was her name. She was fantastic! On my hunt for Portland Pub Perfection, I found it in the service I received. I can't speak for the other waiters, but ours was five stars.

If anything, the waffle can be a bit sweeter (for contrast with the chicken) and cooked more crispy (so it gets less soggy sitting under the chicken).If you want the chicken and waffle, it's way better to eat it for brunch/lunch than dinner.

The ambience is charming, with a playlist that satisfied the musical tastes of five diners. Dinner: We tried the wood oven roasted meatballs,french onion soup, romaine salad, and caramelized onion & brussel sprout pizza. \\nWe had a family style dinner, sharing all the dishes we ordered (except for the french onion soup, I can't share that with anyone) and it was enough to leave us satisfied. I must commend the chefs on their attention to detail when it comes to the food. It's been a while since I could taste real flavors in every bite at a Boston restaurant. The crust on the pizza was also particularly tasty, thick enough to taste like a pizza but thin enough to accompany the cheese, brussel sprouts and onions. The romaine salad was a little too heavy on the dressing for my taste, but was still quite yummy. Brunch: I had the turkish tomato-baked eggs (menamen) and the almond-banana pancake. \\nBoth dishes were divine. I couldn't taste the eggs because they were perfectly blended with the tomatoes and cheese. The pancake was one of the best things i've ever tasted - so good that i'll probably be back next weekend to eat it again. It's not your average stack of buttermilk pancakes. It's a single, thick pancake with the maple bourbon butter soaked in it. It was big enough that I shared it with someone, and it's bursting with flavors. My only criticism are menu options.

I saw another review saying the person found a roach in her food. \\nThe food was very bland and for the size of the entree we ordered it was over-priced. Mango lassi had a neon orange color, the samosas were bland, the naan was just...dripping in grease yet no flavor, the rice was okay and the chicken bland and again, overpriced for the teeny size it was. The hostess was just sitting at the bar  eating, texting, not taking care of customers and giggling every time she misplaced a receipt...\\nThe only reason I feel bad writing this review is because our server (might be the only one there) was very nice. Kept checking in with us and asked me if anything was wrong (I didn't have the heart to tell him). Again, good service but then again we were the only ones in there. Food was gross we actually got sick as well (yet another review I read on this place) and we don't have any digestive ailments. I hear Bombay Cafe is better. I also like Chat Patti (more buffet style and awful service but great food):) and Bojanic is decent"},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite dim sum joints, located just outside of Chinatown proper, closer to the Leather District.

My jewish bubbe (grandmother) was spinning in her grave last year when I couldn't find kosher for passover matzah at the Hannaford in Norwell. The \\"ethnic\\" foods section had one sad ass can of matzah farfel and one pathetic looking, crushed container of matzah ball mix. And a whole mess of matzah that was clearly marked with NOT KOSHER FOR PASSOVER. While I appreciated that the management of the store in our very homogenous South Shore community was culturally aware enough to have passover items, I didn't end up keeping passover because I couldn't get anything but a box of matzah farfel. (For the uninitiated, matzah farfel is roughly equivalent to styrofoam peanuts. delish. Next on the menu, marinated bubble wrap.)Enter The Butcherie and its fantasia of kosher glory. I'm hardly religious, but I do wax nostalgic over the promise of a nice fat slab of brisket. My husband almost fell over when I brought home traditional foods for him to nosh (nibble in yiddish) on like knishes and potato latkes. This place has the mother lode of Israeli import items and carries a mind-boggling number of treats. I was able to find the elusive Israeli chocolate spread (similar to but better than Nutella)  and spied kishke and vernekes in the freezer cases. If you don't know what these are, don't fret. Go to the Butcherie, buy something with Hebrew writing on it (pretty much anything) and take a chance- if you close your eyes and bite into said vereneke's tender dough exterior and soft potato interior, you'll be instantaneously transported back to Poland in 1870.  Time travel by jewish dumpling. Note that this isn't the place to come before any major Jewish holiday- before passover, it was like the scene from the Ten Commandments depicting the slaves fleeing Egypt (apropos, but annoying). With the crushing mass of people pressing toward the cash registers it can feel claustrophobic and the line veritably snakes around the shop. Also, be aware that kosher meat and special imports can be pricey. A 2 lb. kosher brisket ran me $47.00, but it was a small price to pay to keep my mother-in-law quiet.  Also consider avoiding the herring case. Though they have a remarkable variety of herring, unless you're a 90 year old man with hair growing out of your ears, herring is sketch.Oy vey!

I get a much better deal at so many other places nearby. We always feel rushed here. And neglected. There's a detached and remote feeling when we come in. With one exception, we have always been given our bill before ordering dessert and coffee. The first time, you chalk it up to inexperience, but when it becomes a pattern, you wonder. Come on over to my friendly house next time instead of going to Christopher's. I will show you how it should be done.

The one good thing are the pancakes are probably the best I've had since moving to Boston, but it's just not worth it to pay for them.I've been three times and each time I've had to wait 10 minutes for a drink after ordering when it's slow. My final trip there, I had to wait over 20 minutes, just for a cappuccino. The bartender doesn't understand how to use the espresso machine, and didn't mention that when I ordered. So, I sat at the bar, watching him make drinks for everyone else, until I reminded him I ordered a drink and then he finally admitted he had no idea how to make one. He then took his time asking someone for help, and then that person waited another 10 minutes to make my cappuccino. Mind you, I worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years, I know not to be rude, condescending, etc. to staff when you can clearly see that it's busy or the server/bartender is busy prepping for the day/night etc..

They should just say sorry and we will fix it for you. It lets me know for sure that I needn't go there again. Maybe they need some retraining for the kerchief wearing waitresses and ladies at the counter, as to how to resolve issues without engaging the owner of the business to come to our table.  Also found their signs a bit offensive. Like this one, \\"be nice or leave\\"   REALLY, you won't have to tell me twice.  P.S. the food was not great.

The food was delicious.  Is it right to say BBQ is delicious, well it was.  We had to order the fried rib appetizer.  I have seen plenty of things fried but not ribs.  My husband was skeptical because it was only 3 or 4 ribs.  I guess he wanted a full slab of fried ribs.The fried ribs are to die for and guess what, the appetizer filled up my husband so, he couldn't eat much of his entre.  The ribs were fall off the bone and meaty.  The mac and cheese was great because it was real mac and cheese and not some boxed stuff with cheese added.  The fried okra with buttermilk batter was so good I ate most of it from my husbands plate and I don't even like okra fried or not.Overall I say get on over to Fox Bros.

We had two appetizers: crab artichoke dip and pan fried oysters. They both hit the spot, not sure what to choose if you only have one choice. For my entree I had the scallop saut√© with bacon, mushrooms and artichokes. It was good although the scallops did not have the browned goodness I usually enjoy. The mushrooms melted in my mouth. Should have asked what kind of mushrooms were used. Be prepared to spend your money here. I think all the entrees are over $20. However, it is nice there are many wine options starting around $7 and there are two size options. I am not a fan of restaurants where the most economical option is $ 12 for a sip of wine that costs no more than $ 8 a bottle. The service was outstanding. We had the sweetest waitress.

The place was practically empty, so we were quickly seated, each ordered a burger, got some water and chatted for a while.  The waitress brought over a bottle of ketchup and some mustard, and we waited some more.  There were two other parties in the place, and we watched them get their food, eat it, and pay.  We got hungrier and hungrier, and more and more worried, as our precious lunch break ticked away, with no sign of our burgers.Finally, after 40 minutes of staring down the increasingly nervous wait staff, who were continually wandering in and out of the bar and the kitchen but scrupulously avoiding our table, I called one of them over and asked if our food was coming out any time soon.  She went and chatted with our original waitress; the two of them went behind the bar, where we couldn't see them.  I looked at my watch for the fiftieth time; 1:15pm, and just about out of time.Finally our original waitress emerged from behind the bar and admitted that she had punched in our order, but didn't press \\"Send\\" on her order machine thingy.  Our food was not coming out, really sorry.  Would that be a problem for us????Yes, it is a problem.  Having no lunch after a 40 minute wait, with nothing but water - not even a goddam roll!?! - IS A PROBLEM.  We had no choice but to leave, hungry and empty-handed.  My husband ran to work on an empty stomach, while I went to the grocery store for some fig newtons, and returned to my work.  What I don't get is, our waitress was in and out of the kitchen throughout the entire 40 minutes that we waited.  There were only two other parties in the restaurant, and they had already gotten their food.  How could she have failed to notice that the cook wasn't making our burgers?Christopher's, your food may be good, but you really let us down today, and that's no way to treat your customers.  They handle dinner just fine, but the lunch wait staff are incompetent, and ruined what should have been a really nice, easy lunch.  Worst was the failure to even attempt to make amends.

So you have to arrive 3 to 5 hours before they open to be in the front of the line. This brisket is probably the priciest you've ever paid for. Is it worth it? Absolutely! You've never had brisket quite this good. No matter what your thoughts are on other briskets I'm telling you it's not been this good. It's just simply perfect!  Best barbecue, especially the brisket, I've ever had. The people are so friendly. Aaron came by our table and visited with us for 4 to 5 minutes. There are no secrets in how they do things. But it's nothing you can duplicate at home or anywhere else. We were able to go into the pit room and talk with Benji and Ben. Once the line starts moving you wait a bit longer to place your order as you approach ever closer to BBQ heaven in your mouth. At the counter it's quick moving but not rushed. And to help teach you what you are about to indulge yourself in, they cut off a rather large chunk - a taste if you will. Watching them slice your meat is a thing in itself.  Absolutely fantastic experience. Epic BBQ. There's no wonder why this is rated number one in America.  This is what everyone from backyard barbecuer to restauranteur is seeking in doing barbecue.

We went in and got a Lebanese chicken wrap, and my mom and I shared a plate with chicken, rice, hummus, and a salty tomato-cilantro combination on the side.It was so filling and I was pretty impressed.

The cornbread and biscuits that were provided at the beginning were very good.  I went with a starter of the 'Chicken Livers'.  They were pretty good but nothing great.  I then had the 'Grilled Salmon' with a side of 'Collard Greens'.  The collard greens as a side were probably the best part.  The collard green kimchi was a tad over powering in terms of the ginger flavor and the sweet red quinoa along with the salmon just didn't go.  The flavors did not harmonize at all.

Great \\"new American\\" food, great selection of cocktails and craft beers, excellent service, and a nice downtown NYC decor. We went for the first time this past saturday and it was packed. There are so many great options on the menu it was tough to choose. They were doing an excellent job handling the crowd too. Owner is a really nice hardworking guy too and wish them all of the success in the world. We will be coming back. We ordered: oysters ((3 for $7) x 2), the cucumber salad (~$12), the duck maple chili wings (~$10) and their mac and cheese (~$14). Our server was friendly, informative, and also really nice.  She \\"coursed\\" our order, which was really nice - meaning oysters, then came salad, then the wings and mac & cheese. It was nice to be able to enjoy the meal in stages as opposed to everything at once. Their daily oyster was from Duxbury, exceedingly fresh, and properly shucked.  The salad was good, everything fresh, nice dressing, but let's talk about these duck wings. Fall off the bone spicy and sticky sweet duck meat. Melt in your mouth good. The mac & cheese was solid, had bits of pancetta or bacon (or some pig product) and was really tasty.  It was not the best mac and cheese I've ever had, but it was solid.  We thought that all of food items were excellently prepared and fairly priced. Top marks.Drinks: we had their take on a mint julep, a nitro milk stout, and a racer 5 ipa.  Drinks were so good that we also got their bee sting (jalepeno honey tequila) and the moscow mule (vodka and ginger beer). Just like the food menu, the drink menu has plenty of great options. I think the prices were quite fair - especially on the beer. I think some of the cocktails could have been $1 less, but I'm really searching for criticism here. As a side note: I like that they turned the tv's in the bar area off after the bruins game, turned the lights down a bit, and turned the music on. I like that it's not sports bar, but they played the game on mute for those at the bar, and then didn't leave it on for all the post-game nonsense. The music: we heard a nice mix of like 90s and early 2000s east coast r&b and hip hop. Just the right volume, and nice selection of songs that brought that nostalgia for anyone in the 26-35 crowd I'm sure."},{"name":"Paul's Omelettery Restaurant","address":"2211 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I decided to take my husband here after reading rave Lonely Planet reviews.

We were strolling down Newbury St. and saw Sonsie and decided to eat there. Now, we go in and the restaurant is practically empty, so we ask the hostess if we can sit by the window. She looks us up and down and then says something about how those tables are reserved. It was fairly early and there were plenty of empty tables, but we obliged. A few minutes after sitting down we began chuckling because we realized the hostess must not have though we were \\"cool\\" enough or \\"fashionable\\" enough to sit near the stupid window. We were dressed casually, nothing too fancy (just jeans and decent tops), but I guess we weren't \\"cool\\" enough for her. It was hilarious. Hardly anyone sat in any of those tables that were apparently \\"reserved\\" the whole time we were there. We wanted to say, \\"Hey! We're from NYC! We've eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world!\\" but we declined, and merely laughed to ourselved.Afterwards, it became a huge joke that we ate at Sonsie (which we proceded to pronouce in a really snooty accent...Saaaaahhhnsie). They really should change their name to \\"Poncey\\"- in fact, we told people from Boston that we ate there and they also smirked because they know what a scene that place is.

I'd heard the chicken was pretty good, and as a connoisseur of all things chicken, I figured we would give it a shot. When we got there, valet was nice. The entire place is reminiscent of an old southern plantation, with a large front porch and beautiful flower arrangements smattered about. \\nEveryone at our table absolutely loved their drinks. I got the Penicillin and while I'm not usually a gin gentleman, I must say that it was delicious. The cornbread was equally delicious. I'm sad to report that the drinks and the cornbread were the best parts. Our waitress was really aloof, snobbish almost, and was hawkishly watching us as if we were burdening her by sitting at the table. Twice she tried to grab our plates when we were clearly only half way done eating and was condescending anytime someone asked her a question. She couldn't make eye contact and she was just really strange. Drinks took an absurd about of time to come from the not-very-busy bar. The chicken is overpriced and overrated. It wasn't awful, it was pretty good, but this is Atlanta. There is delicious fried chicken all over this town- and most of it is better than this and a fraction of the cost (see: Eats on Ponce). $14 for what looked and tasted like scraps from the bottom of a KFC bucket and then an additional $5-$7 a piece for lackluster appetizers. The chicken and dumplings were drowning in salt. Between the 4 of us, we spent $190 on what we could have paid $40-60 for anywhere else. I'm going to estimate a lifespan of 2 years on this concept- just not worth it.

The food is definitely higher quality than other cafes: I almost always get the turkey sandwich, which is a surprisingly flavorful version of such a dish, and comes with salad rather than fries.The service is usually quick, if somewhat silly: because they've been rated as having the best looking staff in midtown, the guys that work here are often dudes who overdress and would kill to be European. The guy who served me last week had stonewashed jeans with slits cut all down the legs and I couldn't help staring at them.

No air con and with the open kitchen it was super hot. \\nThey had a new summer cocktail list.  I tried the Paloma which has tequila and bf got the gin basil smash which was our fav!  Muddled cherry tomatoes with basil soda water and gin! Who woulda thought! \\nWe then ordered the appy sampler which came with the salsa, guac and both of their ceviche and a plate of chips. The portion of the four samples were very generous and I enjoyed it very much. However I really don't understand why restaurants never serve enough chips for the dips....we ordered extra chips for $1 which isn't bad at all...but i wish they would just come with enough chips with the initial order. \\nWe then ordered four of their tacos which was really tasty. Bf ordered beef tongue and pork and I got the fish and chicken. I wasn't a big fan of the chicken but the fish was delicious!!! \\nThen we ordered the chicken as the main dish. They only had one left so the waiter was kind enough to reserve that for us. (They mark on the chalk board what they have left for their 3 main course dishes - chicken, fish and lamp. The fish was sold out already when we got there.) \\nWe were both stuffed to the max. No room for dessert or another drink. My bf and I both loved this place! \\nWould I come back here again? Most definitely! Do I think it's a good date place? Totally!  Would it be a fun place for group dinners? Absolutely! \\nFinally I just want to mention how amazing the staffs were also!

Let's get down to business shall we?Ambiance:\\nThe ambiance of this location is not exactly 100% Japanese. I'd describe the vibe that it gives off is traditional Japanese accents with an american twist. From the wooden tables, the ropes hanging to the graffiti filled bathrooms, its a pretty low key place for some good ramen. Not beat down and not scaled up, casual. You have to check out the bathrooms if it's your first time here, definitely unique. Customer Service:\\nThe customer service is good, not the best but definitely tentative. The employees are always polite, even if the place gets crowded and busy. The staff is also willing to recommend some dishes if it is your first time. Food:\\nThe food here is delicious, some of the tastiest ramen I've had, and hands down the best in Austin, Texas. I believe what really sets them apart is the egg that they have in about every ramen dish unless you get the vegetarian one. The lunch time ramen is a chicken based broth, which gives you a lighter filling of fullness. NOTE that during the lunch hours, only two ramen options are available, so be aware of the ramen choices so you won't get let down if you want a certain ramen at the wrong time! Anyways during dinner time, the majority of the ramen are pork based, as in the broth. The Tonkatsu Sho-yu Ramen (#2) is a pork based broth is what I believe is the most popular picked ramen during dinner time. The broth is flavorful and the DELICIOUS EGG, makes the ramen a star. I have to repeat this again and give you a tip, make sure you don't get the egg drenched with the broth. Take a sip of the broth to really taste the broth then take a bite of the egg with the broth and taste that delicious egg yolk, it will give you that \\"WOW\\" effect, you wont regret it. Also the sides dishes as in the chasu bowl is alright, I consider all the side dishes as filler items to make you full. It's good but nothing excellent.Constructive Criticism:\\nSo I have some minor suggestions for this restaurant, but note that this should not deter you from trying this place, it would probably be really a 4.5star if I could give it a 4.5 star review1. Expand this location if possible to accommodate more people at once.\\n2. I understand the place is relatively small, so thus there is a long line and thus you have one cashier to slow down the pace of people to get seated, to allow time for other customers to finish their food, but maybe consider a second cashier?\\n3. Where are the asian workers? I know the owner is asian, but most of the people that work here look like \\"hipsters\\" and I have no personal complaint about this, I come here frequently and can account for them for being some of the nicest people! I just know some people judge a restaurant's \\"validity\\" by seeing the workers and if the workers or at least some of the workers of the ethnicity of the food you are dining at.The First Timer:\\nTonkatsu Sho-yu Ramen (#2) with an extra egg and brussel sprouts. (The spicy bomb is an excellent compliment for the spice enthusiast, not to spicy but a little extra kick)The Adventurer:\\nThe Mi So Not/ Mi So Hot, this dish is for the 2nd timer or 3rd timer, because I believe it is more unique for the prototypical ramen that most people expect. It's my personal favorite now!"},{"name":"Dark Horse","address":"2922 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I've always wondered about this place, and last week I was finally able to stop by for a couple of drinks. First of all, this is not the same as the Dark Horse Brewery in Michigan which now has it's own TV show, but it is still cool. Definitely make time to come check this place out if you are into local dive bars. Its pretty dark in the Dark Horse, if you are looking for a place to sit inside during the day and throw back some drinks this would definitely be an option. I personally like that kind of place though. It's very local, I was there for Happy Hour during the week, you'll likely find some good ol' boys sitting around the bar sharing drinks and stories when you stumble in here. There is tons of cool shit on the walls. You could pry walk around this joint for a couple of hours just to see all of the memorabilia. There are some arcade games in the back that seem to attract some younger crowd, which wasn't a bad thing while I was there. They have pool tables and darts in the same room with the video games, so there is plenty of stuff to keep a group of people busy. I haven't been for a football game, but I have friends that tell me this is the place to go for tailgating if you are going to go with bars instead of the tailgating field. Also they have some pretty good food. My lady friend had a chef salad, and I had a sandwich.

I ordered the large chef's choice sashimi sampler. It was OK. The fish was certainly fresh, but there were surprisingly many of what I consider \\"challenging\\" selections: Spanish mackerel, clam, and ama ebi (sweet shrimp), and not enough of the more mainstream selections I would expect at lunch. The mackerel was cut into large, flavorful chunks that were a bit overpowering to my palette: I usually have been served thin slivers that don't impart so much of the \\"fishy\\" taste one associates with mackerel.Overall, I would try Cowfish again, especially with a group, where you could share tastes."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"great bbq, but have a friend stand in line for you :)"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Staple of touristing Portland.

Anyhow since there was a 5 lb minimim we got a half pound of everything in the menu and 3 lbs of brisket. They gave us some free drinks as well which was a nice touch.  We took everything to a nearby park and settled in.  First offÔºåi wanted to try that brisket.  I had had smittys the day before and knew I much preferred my own brisket so I was nervous that Texas style brisket would not be the style for me.  I bit into it and it was just so flippen good.  So so so so good.  I can't really tell you what made it different from other brisket but I know it was just much better. Well the fatty. (it was supposed to be 50% fatty but it was more like 70...score for me!)  the lean was quite good and really tender for lean.  But it won't blow your mind.  I didn't use much of the provided sauceÔøΩ?but when I did I would use the medium sauce.  There was also a dark and light sauce.  The fatty brisket would be 5 stars.  I went to the French laundry this summer and my husband and I were talking (obviously JUST flavorwise)  the fatty was at that level of excellence.  I also thought the sausage was fairly goodÔøΩ?but smittys was much better.  The turkey was very overpowered by black pepper.  In Franklin's book he discusses using a very similar method for all of his meatsÔøΩ?and while it works so well for brisket I really did not care for the turkeyÔøΩ?or the pork ribs.  The pulled pork was alrightÔøΩ?but I prefer mine.  We have these away to some men who came and cleaned up the park.  5 lbs is a lot for 2 adults and 2 very small children.

The Salmon Farrell was decent so we ended up splitting it. When he asked how it was I said it was AWFUL!!!

I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the steak that they had on the menu. Two of the most expensive items. The fish smelled horrible, it was very close to a frozen packaged salmon you would get at stop and shop. There were also pieces of bacon but idk what that was. The smell was really close to dog treats.It was also extremely small, probably the size of a palm. The taste was awful, just cheap salmon. The steak was alright but it was covered with sauce, laid out on top of the French fries. Just super soggy. The steak wasn't what you'd normally expect; a nice laid out steak with basic ingredients on a clean plate. Not soaked up with sauce and French fries. We were more disappointed on the price with the quality it came with.

First of all, it's in a business park which was almost deserted on a Saturday. The gps warned us that the shoppe might be closed when we got there, but we decided to chance it. Boy, am I glad we did!I'm not sure if Shamane was the one who helped us, but she was so friendly and informative. We chose a blackberry galette, a pecan coffee cake muffin, a croissant and a jellied triangle with a french name that was loaded with zingy, sweet/sour flavor and sprinkled with sugar! What an unusual dessert experience. My friend enjoyed his muffin because coffee cake is his favorite. I saved the croissant for the next morning because I had a very early flight home, and the next morning it was still crispy on the outside and fluffy and buttery on the inside. But the highlight for me was the blackberry galette! The pastry was perfectly cooked with no soggy bottom and sweet/sour fruit and a sprinkling of sugar. I couldn't stop myself from eating the whole thing after offering my friend a bite and being thankful that he turned down my offer! The cherry on top was the Bhakti chai with its creamy, spicy goodness.I can't wait to get back to Boulder during the week to try the lunch because the bison pastie was kind of calling my name, but we had eaten lunch already so we made do with some of the best desserts I've ever eaten!"},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome brunch place!!

After fussing at the other gentleman helping him and asked him to stop the transaction the transaction was not stopped in time and it was processed. Ask we came up with a solution noticing they had a 16-ounce drink saying that we had simply paid for 32 ounces of liquid why could we just get two 16 ounce cups and call it even. He continue to argue with me and stated that it cost them money because they are third party company for every cup they have to purchase. So I'm figuring we are arguing over roughly a nickel at this point. He made a phone call and would rather refund the entire transaction and rering the entire transaction over the dollar difference of a drink instead of giving up a $0.05 styrofoam cup for us to enjoy 32 ounces of liquid. After some back-and-forth he finally decided and stated let's just make this easy for you guys and swiftly gave us two 16 ounce cups of Coke.

As impressive is the bacon.  Why?   Bacon is bacon and is all delicious, right?  This was so melty-in-your-mouth and distinctively flavored that it bordered on seeming like pork belly.  And unlike most sides where you grudgingly are given 3-4 slices, this was an actual mound.  A pile.  A savory, porky heap of goodness.

I usually get the lamb shawarma (delicious) and occasionally the falafel (also pretty good, I think, but I'm no falafel connoisseur), in either a sandwich or a dinner plate.The sandwich is perfect for a normal-sized appetite. I would advise against getting the dinner plate unless you have the stomach capacity of a minor god, or a very, very hungry person. I can put away quite a lot of food in one sitting and I still feel absolutely stuffed after finishing a plate, and my companions can rarely finish theirs. That being said, it's worth it. You get a giant pile of seasoned rice topped with your protein of choice and drizzled with tahini, along with some salad, hummus and hot sauce, fries, and pita. Yeah. I'm amazed they can even close the Styrofoam container they serve it in. If you are an average person you could probably make two or even three meals out of this.Be warned: the hot sauce is HOT. I'm pretty white, I admit, but I don't mind a little spice in my food. The hot sauce eaten on its own makes me grab for my water. If you're like me, be cautious about fishing out your fries that have fallen into the sauce (as some inevitably will) if you're almost out of your drink, lol. Right now they have a holiday special running where you can get a free soda can or bottle of water with your meal. Awesome!

The restaurant has a dimly lit interior which gives it a really nice, upscale kind of vibe. It was kind of loud on the inside, so it's a good place to grab a group and have a lively dinner. Interior is dressy but I would not say it was jacket required - it really reflected the after-work crowd from the financial district. It was busy but not completely full, and the many times I've walked past I would say you could probably fly without a reservation. The appetizers were really good - I especially liked the charred octopus dish, which had a really great texture and a light flavor. The lobster mac and cheese appetizer was also absolutely great. It was an interesting combo of sharp, homey tasting cheese with really well done, al dente noodles. Usually restaurants overdo the mac and cheese noodles and it ends up mushy, but they do it like an actual pasta. What it did not have was any flavor of lobster at all - in fact, looking back I didn't even know it was lobster at all. Good choice if you love mac and cheese but bad choice if you love lobster.I'm docking the stars because my entree was awful. I had the pasta in a truffle cream sauce (the tagoliolini al tartufo nero) and it literally tasted like they had dug up all the truffles in France and drowned it in butter. I like truffle cream over pasta, but this was seriously overdoing it. Other entrees around the table looked not bad, but would absolutely not recommend this particular dish.

We had an earlyish reservation (6:45) so they were ready for us - sat us as soon as we were all there. I won't belabor the details, but all of the food was fantastic. It was a $90 a person four course fixed-menu meal, but all eight of us were extremely satisfied; and this included a very picky eater, a pecsatarian, and someone with a gluten allergy (the first two had plenty of options, the third had a custom meal prepared for them). The only reason I give them a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star is something of a pet peeve of mine. When looking over the drink menu, I noticed that my favorite glass of Scotch (10 year Laphroaig) was $16. Assuming they pour a 2oz glass and there are 12.68 2oz shots in a 750ml bottle, they are making $202.88 off of a bottle of Scotch that you can get retail for under $50. That's more than 400% profit. I'm happy to pay markup on food when it's better than I can cook. But there is nothing about that glass of Scotch that makes it 4 times better than what could pour at home.But that aside, everything the food was great, that atmosphere was fine. (It was a little bit loud, but I didn't detect any music, so I'm not sure where the volume came from.) The only other nit-picky thing was that they had these metal (I think) beads separating the entry from the bar, and they were pretty annoying while we were waiting for our friends to show up for dinner.

The sausage gravy had actual chunks of flavorful sausage. For drinks I got the lemon mint slushie which was like the best mojito ever in slurpee form (minus the alcohol). He got the raspberry lime ricky, also very tasty and refreshing.This is my new favorite burger place in Boston."},{"name":"Kyoto Sushi & Grill","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 106","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"First thing to comment on is the pleasant staff.

It was everything I wanted it to be - down to the very last detail - and I could not be happier! It was the perfect place for me, because I was looking for something outside of the normal hotel ballroom, or currently trendy rustic barn setting. Originally we were planning a backyard wedding, but I wanted something that would require less hands-on, DIY work. Serafina is a beautiful location - it's obvious that the owners hired an experienced interior designer / decorator and detailed fine craftsman. From the light fixtures, to the furniture, to the mix of raw and finished woods and metals, the vibe is effortlessly cool and unique. I got a lot of compliments from my guests about my wedding overall, and specifically about the location (and the food - more on that later). Serafina's gorgeous d√©cor meant that I only needed to bring in a few florals. I added a couple of frames and some items from Home Goods, but it wasn't necessary. The real reason my wedding went so smoothly is Serafina's Director of Private Events, Liz Flink. I cannot speak more highly of Liz. From the beginning, Liz demonstrated her knowledge and innovative thinking - offering an array of options on setup, food, d√©cor, and more. She went above and beyond - both before the event with flexibility on beverage options, meetings and site visits - and on the day-of, providing a room to be used as a bridal suite stocked with apps and bubbly, seeking out my mother to make sure she was well taken care of, even bringing in a full length mirror from her home for that last look before I walked down the aisle. She basically served as my wedding planner, providing recommendations on a florist, acting as point person with my DJ and photographer, and cuing me when everyone was in their places and it was time for me to walk down the aisle (she even timed out the music beforehand so she would know when I should take my first steps). Liz even set up our d√©cor for us - staying late the night before after another private event, and coming in early on the morning of my wedding day to make sure all of the details were ironed out. Another thing to note is that I had three friends who needed a \\"nursing mother's room\\" at my wedding, and Liz made sure they had a private space. She also took care of our vegetarian friend... I'm pretty sure she threw in a few extras for me along the way! And even if she didn't, she made me FEEL that I was getting the royal treatment - isn't that what every bride deserves? The staff was also wonderful, quick, efficient, unobtrusive, kind, and were not stingy on the pours at the bar! As we all know, food is highly important at a wedding. Plus I'm a bit of a foodie, so I was never going to be one of those brides who doesn't eat at her own wedding. Well, the food at Serafina was fabulous! The steak was cooked to perfection! And even the pickiest of eaters were satisfied. There was more than enough food, and they even let me take home leftovers! I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend holding your wedding, or any private event, at Serafina. You will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Ridiculous.Like many have said, expect a wait....but then at the same time expect some of the best fried chicken you've ever had.

The place looked busy; we snagged the last table.  It must be a good sign that the place was full.  So I thought.  There was only one waitress, and service was super slow.  I felt bad for her.  She wasn't inefficient, there were just too many tables and take out orders for one person to handle.  The place looked better decent decor-wise.  Not high-end but at least there was some effort at creating an atmosphere.  The Japanese tableware looked nice too, and from where we were standing, looked well- presented. Then we got to the food.  My daughters were whining about being hungry.  We waited 10 minutes for water/tea, another 5-10 for her to take our order, then another 20 for the ramen to arrive.  The food was mediocre at best.  We ordered a miso ramen for the girls to share.  I'm not a ramen connoisseur so cannot comment on the quality.  I only took a bite, and left the rest for the girls.  I ordered the kimchi seawee salad, which sounded intriguing but it was way too salty.  I hadn't ever seen chicken karaage the way they made it; the batter was doughy, though my older daughter liked it.  I also ordered the cali maki combo.  The rice was too mushy and not adequately seasoned.  They were also poorly made; the tuna and salmon rolls were falling apart, and there was a huge piece of salmon sticking out of the roll (was it intentional?!?).  I had promised the girls dessert, unfortunately, so I had to go up to the counter to order it, as it was pointless to wait for her to come to us.  Lucky we only ordered the mochi ice-cream, as it was pre-made and came pretty quickly.  By the time we left, there were probably two parties hovering near our table, waiting to get in (we were seated by the door).  I don't understand the appeal.  I wouldn't come back."},{"name":"Da Bomb BBQ","address":"744 Broadway St","city":"Revere","stars":"4.5","text":"Decided to try this place on a last minute whim with my boyfriend on a Saturday night.

For some reason, the fishes were a bit warm...not sure if the chef had a hot hand or what.  All I kept thinking was I better not get food poisoning (btw, I did not).  Hot pot is just normal.  Nothing special nothing different but their portion are more than normal.   It could be due to grand opening.  The place does have a nice atmosphere and decoration. Our table was small.  With such a large place, it would've been nice if we had more room.  We had to stack a couple of bowls in order to make room for all the plates (there was 4 of us eating hot pot).  I can't say much about their service except for the manager that stood at the front with the hostest.  He seems to care more about chatting with the lady then in greeting any customers.

To my loyal fan, I apologize.  To those who have no clue what I'm talking about, I also apologize for not getting straight to the review.Nevertheless, here goes nothing: a review... of a restaurant... that I love.Dirty Franks is one of several restaurants owned by Liz Lessner in Columbus, OH. Each restaurant is kitschy, unique, and delicious. Dirty Franks is also extremely cheap. Most items on the menu are in the $3.00 range, including the tall boy PBR's.  I'm not kidding and that's not a typo... almost everything is $3.00.  If you're like me and don't live in Columbus (anymore), finding a place that sells beer that cheap is like finding a $20.00 bill in the jeans you wore last week.  It just feels good on the inside.They serve hot dogs, maybe something else, and maybe one other thing... but really you come here for the hot dogs and the scene.  It's not quite hipster, but it's definitely hip.  The dogs are delicious.  You can get a chili dog, maybe something with sriracha, maybe something with baked beans, maybe some slaw, or maybe anything you can just about imagine on a hot dog and it's all frickin good.   Below is a photo of the Amy's Big Boston Dog I just ate.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/osuhomebase/8628532043/in/photostreamUnfortunately the damn thing was so good I ate it before the camera was able to capture an image of the hot dog.. all that was left for the camera was the aftermath of some bacon and cheese fries that I later had dreams about.They have great themed nights like \\"I Love Cleveland\\" Tuesday's and I'm pretty sure they only play local music.  You can't go wrong... and if you really hate hot dogs or don't like local music you should check out one of Liz Lessner's other restaurants, conveniently called out at the bottom of the dirty franks website.

The service was poor and the food was worse. There is a clear lack of management across the board. Our party of 7 dined at Sugar Factory on January 3rd. The misadventure started after a lengthy wait for the waitress and then attempting to order an iced tea. No tea available. Ok, I'll just have water. Someone else at the table orders a goblet drink. It seems fun and colorful. Maybe the price is listed somewhere in the lengthy menu but I don't see a price so I am surprised to see the bill for $24 for a non-alcoholic sugar drink! Seriously?? While we wait another 10 minutes for the water, we review the menu which has a number of items that are \\"starred\\". We assume those are the specialty items so we concentrate on those items. No, turns out those are the items not available, wish someone had told me that before I wasted my time going through all the items that aren't available. Ok, no problem, I'll have one of the flatbreads. Nope, not available. \\"But they don't have a star by them\\" I say. Waitress says \\"well, we don't have it\\" Ok, I'll have the French onion soup and the chicken Caesar crepe with no Caesar dressing. We wait for 45 minutes for the food to arrive. Ridiculous. The soup was not served as the appetizer as requested and of course the crepe was served with the dressing. I send the crepe back and attempt to eat my soup. No spoon.  Two requests later, I am given a long tea spoon, for French onion soup! I wait for my entree while the rest of the party works their way through overlooked hamburgers and cold greasy French fries. Of all the entrees, only the club sandwich was passable. When the chicken Caesar finally arrived, it was honestly one of the worst entrees I have tried to eat at any restaurant. After a bite or two, the waitress comes by and says \\"was it ok\\"?  I respond, \\"No, it was awful, it was inedible\\". She makes no comment and walks away. No response from anyone.

I make it and sell it and think that chocolate dipped pretzels and rolled in M&M's are made with little to nothing and to charge some of the prices including the chocolates just is about profit not quality of product.I ended up getting a peanut butter cup- as I bit into it I heard a crunch- i thought perhaps it was a peanut but why a crisp sound? I then bit again and heard it and was concerned that perhaps it was a bug or worse. They apparently put rice crispies into their peanut butter cups- why? It made it taste tasteless and odd texture. There was NO mention of that on the sign either.I also purchased a bag of Pecan Dreams which gave the illusion of a turtle, NOPE. The first thought I had when biting into this was SALT. The pecans must have come from a mixed nut bag because VERY salty.

All three of us who went really really enjoyed the fresh flavor of it. The Basil chicken was amazing. Really great taste, unique, and addicting. Wonderful smokey flavor. The mustard greens and shredded beef was a great change of pace from most beef dishes. Very tasty. The tofu and Chinese celery was good, but I wasn't a really big fan.

I was intrigued to come here thanks to Food Carts Portland.The one meal in particular I had eyes on: the \\"Bro that's stupid hot\\" chicken sandwich ($7). Grilled chicken, chipotle mayo, sliced jalapenos, insane heat sauce, and sliced tomato on a sesame seed bun. The insane heat sauce consists of ghost peppers, habaneros, serranos, and cayenne. While this would scare a bunch of people away, it only made my smile wider. I got the sauce on the side, so I could (sort of) control the spiciness on my initial experience.Oh, Ellis made me sign a waiver. Yeah, he seriously did. No actual typed form here...he just wrote it on his order pad and I quickly signed it.I really appreciated the smokiness of the insane heat sauce (thanks to the ghost peppers). Having experienced this type of heat before, it wasn't a shock to my system. I guess if Ellis dumped about 6 oz. of this stuff on the sandwich...that may pose more of a threat.Unfortunately, the chicken was dry. It had been pounded flat, which made it more susceptible to overcooking. Better than undercooking, at least.I'm very intrigued by the multitude of sauces at this cart. The number and originality remind me of Portland's heralded bar/wing joint, Fire on the Mountain. All sauces here are made from scratch except the sweet chili sauce. Ellis likes the Spicy BBQ one the most, followed by the Jamaican Jerk. The J.A.F.O. sauce uses ginger, while \\"Black Sabbath\\" contains reduced balsamic vinegar.Ellis plans on changing his menu every so often. In the future, we may have a quantity challenge (I believe he mentioned about 3 lbs of food or a 3-lb burger), as well as a spicy wing challenge (a dozen wings caked in a spicier insane heat sauce).Also consider the weekly specials, such as 50-cent wing Mondays and Chicken-and-Waffle Wednesdays!

The French toast slices were very thick and cooked to a perfect golden brown. I liked the cinnamon and the whipped cream put together...just so beautiful for presentation. The cinnamon also helped to balance the flavors.But let's face it, the rum-flamed caramelized bananas were the star here. They were still temperature-hot from cooking on the stove mere minutes earlier -- and you can definitely taste that rum in there! When combined with the toast, whipped cream, and cinnamon, I was completely blown away by how amazing this was. I couldn't stop eating, no matter how hard I tried.

The mussels themselves were large and tender and was frustrated that I could barely eat it because of the spice.

The greasiness of the burger is complimented by the sweetness from the doughnut which is kept in check by the saltiness of the thick cut applewood smoke bacon.

The pretzel bread that came with it was good, too. The perogies were fine, and I liked the relish (is that what you'd call it?) that was with it. The fried risotto balls were pretty good, too. Liked the truffle popcorn, and would order that again, but I could have popcorn for dinner. We tried a lot of things. It's just that none of it really stuck out as superbly awesome. I'll tell you what I didn't like. I didn't like eating out of those cardboard boat things like you get from a food trailer. Almost everything we ate required some sort of dipping and the \\"boats\\" just weren't conducive to doing that easily and un-messily. And then the fondue cheese that dripped off, and the marinara from the risotto and the aioli from the perogies gets all mixed up and that's just not my favorite. You also can't easily put your silverware down on these things. It was just an odd choice. Everything was so nice and fancy-ish, but the boats--no.But I do appreciate the label on the lotion in the bathroom. (It rubs the lotion on its skin.)"},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"The reviews speak the truth - I went for the scene, and indeed I found just that.

One of the owners sat beside me and my buddy upstairs and then after we were done asked us how our meal was and asked for suggestions and just casually talked for a few minutes. It was nice to give feedback in person to the owner and to talk to him. It really shows he cares about his business and the customers satisfaction. Food 4.8/5 it was really good food. What can I say.

My love of Korean dramas has made me jealous of how easy it is to get your ramen fix in Korea (granted, I have now learned that it's just Shin Ramyun or whatever instant ramyun you can heat up in a convenience store and eat on a table outside the store).  Welp, lo and behold, authentic Japanese ramen.  I had been hesitant to try ramen at the few places that offered it prior to Tatsu-Ya, but alas...mixed reviews.  Being on a college student budget, I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest $10 or so on a bowl of possibly meh.  Upon finding out about their soft opening, I took it upon myself to read up.  Crushing real hard...Anyway, shortly after the grand opening, I dragged a bunch of my friends here to try it with me.  We waited in line for some time (perhaps 30 minutes or so) until we finally reached the cashier.  I picked the #1: tonkotsu ramen and that was all.  In a few minutes, my bowl came out, beautiful presentation and all.  The noodles were a surprise to me, of course, as I'm accustomed to curly/wavy noodles, but delicious nonetheless.  The ajitama egg...mouthgasm.  I would eat a bowl of ajitama eggs if possible.  Lovely gooey golden yolk, marinated in soy sauce as described.  The chashu pork belly is the most tender in all the city.  There has been no other ramen place that can even compare when it comes to the chashu.  Tatsu-Ya reigns supreme.  The broth is wholesome and I've already resorted to coming here to cure the woes, whatever they may be.  So, did I say I was crushing?  Hell, I'm in love.My third time here, I decided to add the corn on the bomb.  What a splendid idea.  I love having a juxtaposition of flavors in my mouth, so here we have the sweetness of the corn playing well with the salty richness of the broth.  So freaking good.My most recent time coming here was for lunch. I went out on a limb and decided to pay for a drink (college budgets normally call for water and ice only).  I picked Calpico and it is a delicious fruity drink.  Good fruit juice in a can.  The most dominant fruit taste I can pick out from the drink is pineapple and it reminds me of this pineapple drink I liked getting every time my family shopped at Hong Kong Supermarket (sadly, it was discontinued).Loving the chicken shoyu too.  Thicker noodles.  Delicious salty rich broth.  It's love again.  The ramen never disappoints me.  Also, no line!!!  I went the day before Thanksgiving, so I'm guessing most people were out of town.Despite complaints about not being able to take it to-go, I fully agree with the chefs' philosophy when it comes to eating ramen.  Psh, I'd never take pho to go...especially from a restaurant, knowing that the powder will settle and all.  It's best straight out of the pot!!!  I feel bad if I don't eat it all and drink my bowl clean.  Absolutely no shame in raising the bowl to my lips and tipping it back high my first time there.  Out of the four times that I've gone, the ramen has only conquered me once and I blame it on the generous helping of jajangmyeon I had earlier for lunch that day.Mochi ice cream here is good as well.  Perhaps not made in-house, but much better than a box I bought at nearby Hong Kong supermarket *shudder*.As for appetizers, I've had the yodas (grilled brussel sprouts) and the chashu slider (Hawaiian roll, chashu, etc).  All good, in my opinion.The bathrooms are famous for the beautiful murals.  No idea what the guy's restroom looks like, but I'm sure it's just as wonderfully decorated.  I love how the entire wall is decorated.  Even the paper towel dispenser :)I would say that waiter service has improved since their first days.  I don't feel as rushed, but also, I'm one to go in, eat my food, and not sit for too long.  If I want to hang out with a friend, I might as well head over to CoCo's Cafe and sit.  For $5 or so, you get much more of a dessert a la boba drink than $3 for two mochi ice creams.  I also like how one of the owners (Tatsu) is very present in the front of the house.  I'm a huge fangirl and I'm pretty much up-to-date on all things Tatsu-Ya.Closing notes: Ramen Tatsu-Ya is my number one.  Michi is my number two.

Tasty Burger is kind of a UBurger - Boston Burger Company hybrid.The good - There's beer! The selection isn't huge and there aren't too many on tap, but it's pretty standard and reasonably priced. There's a lot of selection for burgers and other sandwiches, and the prices are great. There's even vegetarian/vegan selections as well! The burgers are similar to UBurger (thin, greasy and yummy), but there's also some \\"specialty\\" burgers like at BBC. We got a Green Monster shake to go, which was really good but on the thick side. There's FREE PARKING at the Fenway location, though there aren't a ton of spots. Cool vibe, moderately-sized bar, indoor/outdoor seating, and walk-up takeout window.The bad - Not a whole lot of bad! I sat at the bar because the place was really busy (it was St. Patty's Day). My boyfriend and I each ordered a beer, burger, and fries. Our order got lost in the rush somewhere because it took a long time to come out. The bartender was clearly very busy, but when she checked on our order after about 15 minutes she said it was coming out next. We watched several huge batches of food leave the kitchen.. the person next to us got his order, ate it, and left... we finally got out food about 25-30 minutes after ordering. It was really yummy, but unfortunately the buns got super soggy since it had probably been sitting in the kitchen for a while. I'm sure the service is much much faster on a day that isn't crazy busy like that. The bartender was apologetic and obviously really busy. The only other \\"bad\\" is that the inside has really no waiting area, so when the place started to fill up it was really overcrowded a loud.The prices are very cheap, but it can add up quickly. 3 beers, 2 burgers, 1 fry, and 1 milkshake came to about $50 (with tip). Obviously the beer pushes up the price a lot, but my wallet wasn't happy that \\"going out to grab a burger\\" cost me $50 (I was paying for both of us).

From the second you are in front of the door, still on the sidewalk, they make you feel welcome. I sat at the bar and was greeted by Mike. I was by myself for the first 20 minutes or so. Mike asked if I was waiting for anyone and when I said yes he put a \\"reserved\\" sign in front of the seat next to me. (It's the little things that count!) He had a great personality the entire time and was very attentive. On the way out, I was waiting near the exit for my friend who was in the restroom, so the hostess came over and kept me company while I waited. She was so sweet and very easy to talk to! They definitely go the extra mile.Drinks: \\nBefore ordering, the bartender - Mike - told me if I didn't see anything on the menu I liked, to just let him know and he can make me something. I should have taken him up at that.  I was waiting for a friend and distracted -¬†so I ended up panic ordering off the menu and got the Demi (I think that was the name). I was a little surprised when I got it because I wasn't expecting it to be that girly, but after I reread the ingredients I realized I should have known better. It was still good -¬†just not what I was expecting from a \\"speak-easy\\" bar. It was over the top girly and not nearly as strong as I would like a $12 drink to be.That is my only complaint about my experience here - which could have been avoided if I didn't panic order. For my second drink, I decided to just tell Mike that I was really in the mood for an old-fashioned or something similar. I'm new to drinking old fashioneds, so he asked a couple questions of what I like and made me one. It was awesome. My suggestion is when ordering a drink here -¬†talk to the bartender about what you're in the mood for. They know what they are doing!Food:\\nWe ordered the duck meatballs and pork & clams -¬†both to share. The meatballs came out first and were over a bed of brussle sprouts and blueberries and had a delicious sauce. Then the pork & clams came out -¬†my only complaint here is that there wasn't more pork! There was just enough clams though. I have a feeling not matter what you order for food, it's going to be fantastic.Atmosphere:\\nI love the atmosphere here. We definitely felt like you were in a speakeasy. The music was the perfect volume where you can actually have a conversation with all the people around you but it still sets the tone. This isn't a place that I would go to on a regular basis, for two reasons - It's pricier than I would like to pay (but keep in mind you are paying for the experience here as well) and it definitely attracts a more pretentious crowd (which isn't really my scene but still love to find myself in the middle of sometimes.)

That said if you like drinking beer at 9 am with a group of friends, and like BBQ then waiting in line at Franklin's is perfectly ok.  I would never do this solo and I would probably never do it completely sober.Now that I have that off my chest lets move on to the experience itself.  First I like that they allow you to have said chairs, coolers, and beers on premisis to make the wait more tolerable, and they even have a person that will come around and sell beer, water, or soda about an hour before they open.  The service here was a pleasent surprise.  The drink/order girl and the meat cutter/server were really friendly and seemed to really enjoy the interaction with the customers.The food:  I had the brisket, ribs, and pie.  I kept this trip really simple as I had no real interest in the sides (quite frankly if you are picking your BBQ place by the sides than you probably shouldn't be going to Franklin's to begin with).The brisket was fatty and flavorful but has very little BBQ bark on it.  I prefer my brisket to have a thicker bark because it holds the flavor in and allows the seasonings to be tasted with each bite.  I thought their brisket was good but it wasn't as good as JMuellers or Salt Lick.  Very similar style to how Rudy's makes their brisket.  The ribs are the star of the show for Franklin's in my opinion.  They were super tender and extremely flavorful.  I would say these are the best BBQ ribs in town actually.  They were perfectly cooked, and are the one item you should always order.I tried the bourbon bananna pie because it was a bit different than the standard faire.  This was pretty good.  Crust was flaky and the toppings were firm and flavorful, but for some reason seemed a bit underwhelming.  Maybe I expected too much but if you have a sweet tooth you cannot go wrong with a $4 mini-pie.The sauce was probably the biggest letdown of the trip.  See I am a fan of BBQ sauce,  I look at it as an enhancer to the flavor of the meat and should not be so quickly discredited.  I personally did not like the flavor of any of their sauces individually.  The original was a bit of a diluted flavor that was deceiving by the look.  The espresso sauce was ok but I am not a big fan of bitter coffee flavor.  And noone should ever make vinegar based sauce.  With all that being said I learned that if you mix all 3 into one sauce its a pretty good combination.  The original and vinegar sauce work together to cut the thickness and bitterness of the espresso sauce while the espesso adds a smoky flavor to the overall experience.  All in all Franklin's is damn good BBQ, the service is excellent, the experience is fun and should be done with a group.  I will come back to post up on a beautiful day in Austin Tx and enjoy plenty of cold beer and bbq before noon."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My daughter took me here for a Mother's Day for a late lunch, May 9, during which we shared a couple plates and raita---just the two of us---and we both became very ill within 30 minutes of one another with symptoms of food poisoning that same night.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q in Atlanta, just west of Decatur is insanely good Texas BBQ. There is a clear and definite difference between barbecues from different regions. Texas BBQ is different from southern and Georgia BBQ. At Fox Bros., the meat is slow cooked and slathered along the way with enough bbq sauce that you could eat it dry. Meaning, that they don't drown it in sauce just before serving. While that too can lead to an excellent bbq meal depending on the sauce, Texas BBQ is different.The Barbecue at Fox Bros. is really good. Delicious. Filling. You get more than enough dead pig to satisfy. A key difference in their sauce is that vinegar base is used instead of the sweet sometimes overwhelmingly sugary flavor often found in southern recipes.  It's not too sweet, and very flavorful. Even better, if you want more, they have the exact same spicy sauce sitting in a bottle at your table. Now with sugary sauces, the cooking process carmelizes the flavor, however you don't get an extreme flavor change when cooking a vinegar based bbq sauce.The ribs melt in your mouth and so does the slow smoked pulled pork.The outside of the restaurant looks new. It looks too good. Walking in, I was worried that this would end up feeling like a chain barbecue restaurant. A little too polished, a little too cookie cutter. Good thing I was wrong. No uniforms here. There's also more seating room than the small looking building would have you believe. The Fox Bros. are also there managing (at least on this night that we went for dinner.)The walls are covered in Texas paraphenalia and the furniture is simple varied wood pieces. The ambiance is like that of a good 'ol roadside texas barbecue joint, or at least on it's way. It's still a new restaurant, so the walls are still stretching and soaking in the sauce. It's coming along nicely. In a few months this place is going to be as great as any you'd find in nearly all of Texas.One more thing. The only dessert on the menu is homemade banana pudding. Usually a mixture of several items, but mixed in are vanilla wafers. While you can easily judge the texture and taste of the pudding, one area that is often overlooked are the vanilla wafers themselves. You don't want soggy wafers or crumbs. That means bad things. It means carelessness. The banana pudding here is thicker than not, creamy, and flavorful. The vanilla wafer crumbs on top aren't soggy and add that extra kick in texture."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great gourmet comfort food, exceptional wait staff, especially with a large group, however, not the greatest experience with the staff member at the door.

Got to the register and we ordered the kim chi fries, Kung fu fries and the japayoki fries.  The girl helping us basically didn't want us there and looked like she was \\"literally dying\\" punching in our orders.  After we ordered we sat down and she cranked up the music to the point where I couldn't hear any of my friends and we sat beside each other....

I don't remember exactly but basically one of them were just piles of bean sprouts stacked on fries with some curry sauce poured over it.  The fried pork bits in the kim chi fries were good though, but there was like 3 pieces.  The japayoki or whatever were just sweet potato fries drizzled in some un-memorable sauce.3- the fact that I'm triggered from the music writing this review says something.So is the review about the food or about the really loud speakers?

We left and hit up a few dives, since we felt more comfortable in our natural habitat. Then we decided it would be fun to go to Chinatown and order \\"cold-tea\\" even though we were all WELL above the legal drinking age and the bars were still open. But the prospects of cold beer and warm, delicious Chinese food were too tempting. We entered the massive restaurant and were promptly seated at a table and placed our order for several dishes of food and a few pots of cold-tea, Heineken brand. We chatted about our adventures of the night and looked around noticing several police officers patrolling the entrance and floor. As soon as our food came out and we had had a few bites, several pitchers of ice-cold water were dumped on our heads.It was our friends from the club. They were escorted out as our table was cleared off of the food we had two bites of and we were handed our bill. We didn't even have time to argue because we were being asked to leave. Apparently said club thugs were part of an Asian gang and the restaurant didn't want any trouble so we were to leave immediately because they would come back. Even though we literally had done nothing to these people on both encounters. I paid the bill because I just wanted to get out of there and end the night. We had to demand that the restaurant get cabs for us and to have a cop escort some of our group back to their car to make sure they weren't going to be followed. Maybe we were being a little dramatic, but after a night like that we had a right to be.I'm still sore about this and will never return to Chau Chow City. The whole incident was not our fault, and I can't believe they had the nerve to hand us a bill and ask us to leave.

If you have a party of two try and get a spot at the sushi bar, the counter is a giant iPad that's fun to keep you busy while you wait to order and eat. I suggest starting off with a smashed bourbon which is perfectly made- just enough sweetness and bang without taking you out for the night. I visited this restaurant twice while here and would highly suggest getting the King Roll. I had it both times it was so delicious. Cowfish has reasonably priced kids meal that are served in a fun bento box that even includes a dessert. I'm not going to lie and say this place is cheap though, there is no leaving without at least spending 100 dollars for a party of four (including a drink or two). For the quality of food, atmosphere and amazingly helpful and cheerful staff (thank you Edwin and John), I'll have to say hands down it's totally worth it.

Seriously, the vast majority of the time I've been here (probably 10 times)  it's been great. Tonight though, was really terrible, and it was all about service, which is the only gripe I've ever had here (once I sat at a table for 20 minutes without being even acknowledged, but that was an exception). I went in to watch a football game with my girlfriend, and was greeted pretty quickly. Reggie wasn't very friendly, but whatever, we ordered drinks and a bowl of soup. Got our drinks quickly, and he asked if we wanted to order. I got some fries. Fries came out, but no soup. We asked the next time he came back, and he kind of rudely told us he didn't think we wanted it. Again, whatever. He went to get it, all is golden. He dropped the soup on the way by, not saying a word and leaving the second he put it down. The soup was cold. Thinking maybe it was supposed to be, I asked him the next time he walked by to which he responded very condescendingly \\"uh no, it's soup\\". We said it was in fact cold, and that we had also ordered a bowl (he had brought a cup). He just sort of stared at me looking he might argue and then grabbed the cup off the table. A few minutes later, he slammed (this is not an exaggeration) down a bowl and walked off before we could say a word. We saw him once in the next half hour when I got one more beer. He wouldn't even look at us. It was clear he saw us as a problem table and wanted us to know it. We ended up having to get another waiter to tell him we wanted the check. Having been in the service industry for a long time, I'm usually very forgiving, but I don't think I've ever had a server so upset to be taking care of my table. I'm sure our waiter is a great guy most nights, but you should never treat a table like that. As for the rest? The food was great and the house beer is one of the best deals in town.

When we arrived for our reservation at 4:30 pm they tried to seat us in a room that had a large family with screaming babies.  Other tables were available, and we asked to be reseated to a booth.  They did that for us, but it just seemed strange that they wanted to shove us back there in a very bad setting.  We ended up back by the kitchen and men's room doors.  That's ok though.  The waiter was very short with us, and recited the menu highlights as if he'd done it a million times not even looking us in the eye, but rather scanning all over the restaurant.  When I interrupted to ask a question about something he mentioned it threw him off.  Very impersonal.  We got our salads, and he didn't offer us any freshly ground pepper.  Other waiters did that for their tables, but we didn't get that level of service.  Our meals were very good as I said, but the waiter merely delivered the food with no connection with us at all.

It looked like it was curdling, but I was told its \\"the real deal\\" in terms of whole creams for coffee and gave it a shot. The coffee is not good at all, but hey! It's not a coffee shop! Mike and I started with the infamous praline bacon, which was pretty darn good. Mike said it hasn't ruined bacon for him, but he definitely did enjoy it. For our entrees, Mike ordered two pieces of the fried chicken served over a sweet potato waffle. He said it's the best fried chicken he's ever had. I ordered two biscuits with sausage gravy, which was also quite good. The portions here are large, though, so we could've gone with half orders and been perfectly satisfied.
