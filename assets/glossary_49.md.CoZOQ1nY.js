Kyushu is the western most island in south Japan if you look on a map. The Hakata noodle is meant to be prepared \\"Al dente\\", or \\"to the tooth\\" which is a harder feeling noodle as opposed to Udon which is a soft mushy noodle. The thin Hakata noodle is meant to complement the hearty broth by not over powering it. The noodle is thin and mostly \\"tasteless\\" to convey the broth flavor to the taste buds.

Sometimes their special items are exceptionally good, but in general you won't find the best meal of your life. It's a great place for a date and their brunch menu is also good and well-priced. Lastly, Christopher's has excellent options for vegetarians.\\n\\nFull Review:\\n\\nChristopher's is a hip-looking landmark in Porter Square just about 1 minute away from the subway station. The interior is always classy with a nice fireplace and lots of seating (including an entire upstairs area). I live close by and have been going here for about two years regularly.\\n\\nI've never had a bad meal or bad service at Christopher's. I'm a vegetarian, so I frequently order dishes with blackened or buffalo tofu in place of meat and the tofu at Christopher's is very good. There is also a unique spinach and artichoke burrito on the regular menu that's pretty tasty. The veggie burger isn't bad but it's also nothing special. They frequently have vegetarian soups and special entrees. Almost any vegetarian ravioli they make is bound to be delicious (I've had the 3-cheese ravioli and the pumpkin ravioli and both were excellent).\\n\\nAs much as it pains me to order a dish called \\"yuppie nachos\\", they really are delicious (goat cheese, guacamole, and sun dried tomatoes on tortilla chips). The blackened tofu / black bean empanadas are also a great appetizer.\\n\\nIn terms of beer, Christopher's is right up there with Cambridge Common in terms of having a large, rotating menu. The stuff they always have is decent, but you can always count on 4 or 5 really good rotating draught beers. They also serve good cocktails (I've had a few at brunch).\\n\\nLastly, the brunch menu is great. I highly recommend the blackened tofu breakfast skillet. If you arrive by 11 am, the place is almost never crowded. Around noon it starts to pick up and there can be a long wait. I find it pretty uncomfortable to sit at their bar for brunch; it's just something about the seats and how far away they are from the counter. Waiting for a table is better.\\n\\nThere's no better place to sneak into on a cold, snowy, or rainy Cambridge evening to warm up and have good food and good beer.

It was super crowded even on a Monday night!\\n\\nThe restaurant is more like something you would find in Somerville or other parts of Cambridge closer to MIT. So glad that you can now have a similar experience in Harvard Square, which I typically associate with cheap, quick eats and/or burgers.\\n\\nOrdered the bruised tomato salad appetizer, as well as the roasted squash plate, corn pancakes, and the cornbread w/berries for dessert. The roasted squash plate was probably the second best dish...super fresh and artfully prepared with a milieu of flavors. It is also a decent portion, so great for sharing. The corn pancakes were so buttery and came with kettle corn! Such an unusual yet genius texture combination, which is why it became the easy favorite. The bruised tomato salad resembles more like a bruschetta spread with Latin flavors and pairs nicely with the squash for a fresh, summery start to a meal.\\n\\nThe cornbread dessert was mediocre at best, but I hear that their other dessert options are spot on. I guess I will have to come back...Heaven forbid! ;) The Forbidden Fruit drink was of course very fruity and you couldn't really taste any of the other ingredients besides the grapefruit and peppercorn. Regardless, still a solid drink. Tried my friend's Rum for Your Life and was really pleasantly surprised with the mix of citrus and coffee, two flavors I would not necessarily think would work out as well as it did.\\n\\nOverall, Chef Michael Scelfo raises the bar to a whole new level that I would argue even surmounts some of the other well-known spots in the surrounding Cambridge area, like Oleana and Cuchi Cuchi. If you are looking for a dining experience with unusual flavor pairings and not your run-of-the mill craft drinks, then you should definitely check this place out!"},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went there for brunch on Sunday.

You will leave full and happy if you just come for the happy hour and you'll be ready to come back next time\\n\\nThe regular menu is just as delicious and offers many local produce items and fresh in-season foods. The menu covers everything from breakfast to dinner. I haven't yet had a bad meal here and I've been here many times. The staff are polite and courteous. The bar has many spirits from local distillery's made into wonderful cocktails (try the berry drop or the caramel apple martini yum!). All of their soups, sauces, and desserts are made in house and available for you to take home with you..\\n\\nThe outside patio is open all year long and is covered and heated in the winter. It's a beautiful place to sit on a summer (or even a winter) evening and enjoy your meal.\\n\\nTry this place!

So...the items I wanted to order weren't there. The restaurant was busy when we arrived and was quoted a 30 minute wait with a text to notify us when ready. \\n\\nWe stepped out but in less than 30 minutes, I'd say about 10 max, I received a text saying our table was ready. Yay! There were no table seat available at the time so we sat at the bar, watching the chefs prepare the meals while we read the menu.\\n\\nThe title of the dishes were written in Spanish with the descriptions in English. My friend was scouting for the word like taco's, burritos, quesadilla etc but those were nowhere to be found. We were hungry and the smell of the food was overwhelming. We quickly found our server and put in our order. \\n\\nI had the barbacoa and my friend had the huevos divorciados. \\n\\n-Huevos Divorciados (4.5/5-$15): Divorced eggs: Two corn tortillas, two sunny side up free-range eggs, one topped with salsa ranchera and one topped with salsa verde, divorced by refried beans, and finished with crema, queso fresco, cilantro and crispy bacon. Super delicious. Full with flavour. There was the creaminess of the egg, the sourness of the salsa, the savoury bacon. All blended so well with the refried bean that separated the dish. \\n\\n-Barbacoa (4/5-$19): Lamb shoulder wrapped and roasted in a banana leaf. Served in a volcanic rock, with fresh onions, cilantro, pickled habanero red onions and a side of corn tortillas (6x). This was basically a DIY taco minus the veggies. You do get some serving of salsa, guacamole and picante sauce. It was too little for me so I had to ask for refills. This was interesting but nothing to special other than it's DIY.\\n\\nAn Extra order:\\n\\nSo my friend saw the table next to us share a French toast, yes a french toast at an Mexican restaurant and thought this had to be good. Honestly, I could barely finish my barbacoa...and we ordered one before the last call. \\n\\n-Pan Frances (3/5-$13): Brioche french toast topped with bananas in an aged rum and agave salted caramel sauce, candied pecans, chantilly and one gooseberry. Looks amazing good. I immediately understood why my friend had to order this. Maybe 'cause I don't have such a big sweet tooth, I thought every element was overly sweet and would be satisfied with just the thick brioche and maybe some candied pecans. Those were some amazing pecans!\\n\\nOverall, service was good. I like how easy it was to grab someone's attention and get what you needed done. The food was flavourful.

We arrived without a wait for a table, but ended up waiting almost an hour for our food. The place wasn't even full so I'm not sure why it took so long. When our food did arrive, it was cold and obvious that it had been sitting for a while. I think our waitress deserves some of the blame, but it can't completely be her fault. \\n\\nI got a refill with some cold coffee and had to ask for more. When I brought it up to the waitress, she acknowledged that she was worried the coffee might've been cold when she refilled it.... If that's the case, she should've checked or at least asked me if it was warm. Not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but given our overall experience I think it says something about the service here. \\n\\nThe food wasn't the worst, but it's really hard to judge given that it had sat out for so long before we got it. I got the pork belly hash and the pork belly was overcooked. It had poached apples in it, which really didn't complement the flavors. As mentioned above, the entire dish was cold (eggs, potatoes, pork, apples). I asked the waitress for some Tabasco and it took her so long to bring it back that I was almost finished with my meal. Confusingly, the pork belly hash was served with lettuce wraps. I tried to wrap the dish in the lettuce but the flavors didn't mesh and it was a illegitimate combination overall. \\n\\nMy girlfriend got beef tongue tacos which were a little bit more tasty than the hash, but also cold and underwhelming.

I dream about you if I've been away for a while.\\n\\nThis place is legit.  I've tried other places in the neighborhood with similar menus, and NO ONE can hold a candle to Rami's.  The hummous is, by far, the best I've ever had.  When the wife and I eat here, we can never resist taking a half pound of it home with us.  The falafel is wonderful.  These nuggets of deep fried goodness are smaller than I'm used to, which means a higher ratio of crispy outside to soft, moist inside.  Everything on the menu is of the highest quality.\\n\\nSome people grumble that it's too expensive.  And, while I agree that it's a bit on the pricey side, I feel that you get what you pay for.  The step up in quality of Rami's food compared to it's competitors is well worth the couple of bucks difference.  (While on the subject of price, the wife and I will almost always order the Rami's Special - a plate heaped with hummous, falafel, kebab, grilled chicken and salad - with a few extra pitas... It runs about $25 once we tack on a few drinks, but it's plenty of food for two.) \\n\\nOh, be sure to get the hot sauce!

I presume I could give the chef a few more stars, as our food was delicious while it lasted. However, if I could give Marco the male (presumably the Manager or Owner) negative stars I would 100 times over. First and foremost I am not a complainer nor have I ever even posted a review of anything. \\n\\nI just dined at Sforno this evening with four other people. We had a nice seat outside. Our server Bethany was outstanding. Then it started to rain. All was ok until the awning began to give way and we had water running into our freshly served pasta and about a 1/4 cup of water in my glass of wine.  Once again Bethany the server showed us the highest form of professionalism in the eye of the uncontrollable by offering to find another location for us, as she knew our food and wine had been ruined. Marco then visited our table as we were being drenched and showed zero compassion.  Once we were actually soaked to the bone and I had a half inch of water streaming from the awning into my pasta Bethany picked up our food while we (all 5 of us) gathered our belongings. Not to mention other patrons were offering us to sit with them. Marco then approached us snapping very rudely that there were no tables and there was nothing they could do for us that we would have to leave. Never have I ever seen such behavior. My family have dined in the lowest and slowest and the finest of restaurants worldwide and have never experienced such behavior from a proprietor nor an employee. In Los Angeles, patrons would simply refrain from returning good chef or not. Having many friends in the restaurant industry both nationally and internationally I would have to predict that with people like Marco this place will not be around for years to come.\\n\\nOn a side note Bethany once again came to our rescue and found us a place to finish what was  salvaged from our food. Mind you we were forced to eat standing up in the bar area standing in a line staring at a wall, which was also the line to the bathroom. Not one discount was offered not even the slightest apology other then from our server.

I've become used to trusting their recommendations of food, beer and wine.\\n\\nThe first few times that I went to this place I stuck to the D√∂ner Kebab (sandwich) with fries and half spicy/half normal dressing. I was just hooked. However lately I've tried different things from their menu and I've found new favorites. The D√∂ner Kebab and the D√∂ner Kebab plate are still at the top, but the Iskender Kebab and Wiener Schnitzel are also delicious. I usually love lentils, and their lentil soup is good, but the bean soup is even better. I haven't tried their desserts. If I could remember the names of any of the excellent beers that I've tried at this place, I would write them up. Just ask for a recommendation from 'Boss' (the owner).\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is spacious; they can rearrange the tables to accommodate large groups. The main restaurant area and the restrooms are always spotless. I also enjoy their musical selection (some Enigma today, Pink Floyd and The Beatles on other days).\\n\\nThe amount you spend in this place depends a lot on how much you eat and drink (obviously?).

We ate other dishes, but waited 40 minutes until we decided to leave.  This was around noon.

I do miss Soi 9, but decided to give PUB (Portland Urban Bistro) a try.  The bistro seems to really be a sports bar with several big-screen television scattered about the restaurant, but in their normal advertising seem to identify as a neighborhood restaurant.  This is a little confusing and perhaps they need to work on solidifying their identity one way or the other to bring in the customers.   They do have a full bar and serve soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and dinner fare such as steaks and fish and chips.  \\n\\nI had a later lunch than usual and opted for the Asian Chicken Salad with an orange citrus dressing.  There were lots of veggies in the salad as well as sunflower seeds and hazel nuts.  The dressing was tangy and delicious.  The chicken that came with the salad was nicely grilled fresh chicken, but I thought it was odd that the chicken was still hot off the grill when placed on top of the colder greens.  I don't remember that being indicated on the menu, and maybe that is the way they fix it, but still it seemed odd.  However, the salad was delicious and fresh, but could have been larger.  The salad I received was not a whole lot larger than a dinner salad, and I paid $9.95 for it.  I saw a couple across the way who had ordered burgers and those did look very hearty and tasty.  \\n\\nI found the staff at PUB to be very friendly in a laid-back sort of way, which is fine, but they were also very polite and knowledgeable about the food.  I just had water with my dinner and the glass was kept full at all times.  I was greeted and seated immediately and given a menu at the same time.  My order was taken in good time and the food came out of the kitchen very soon after.  \\n\\nThe space is large and cavernous and I imagine would be difficult to decorate.  Soi 9 did a fine job of decorating, but I think they struggled probably with the size of the space too.  The current owners have put in some attractive tables and booths, etc., but that is all.  Since the restaurant is relatively new, this may be something they have to work on over time.  The televisions were on with volume muted and some music that was low in volume played as well and that helped.  PUB is very clean, so are the bathrooms, and that definitely speaks well for them.  \\n\\nI think when they figure out their identity and get the word out to the neighborhood that they will probably have more customers.  To be fair, I was there on a Wednesday evening that was going back and forth about deciding to rain or not, and there were no sporting events to speak of on television (maybe they do better when the Timbers are playing at Jeld-Wen field just across the street).  I think their food offerings definitely fill a need in the neighborhood in comparison to the several pizza outlets and sandwich shops, and it is nice to have a restaurant nearby that serves some solid traditional meals.  \\n\\nI will definitely return to check out the burgers or other entrees and hopefully will be able to report on any changes in an update to this review."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Came out here after a long day of classes.

That was my order.  No sides.  That first visit was all about the meat.  The brisket was amazing.  I'm not going to be coy here, all the hype is well deserved.  In fact, I have a hard time imaging that brisket could get any better.  It was tender, moist and very delicious.  The bark, the crusty, smoky exterior of the brisket, was perfect. The beauty of Texas-style BBQ is its simplicity. There's basically just a salt and pepper rub and a long, slow cooking time over a low fire.  The devil is in the details and, of course, there are so many ways to go wrong, but the brisket at Franklin's is a triumph!  The pork ribs, however, were overcooked.  The meat slid right off the bone.  I know that sounds ideal to a lot of you and I guess there is a preference to all these cuts of meat, but I feel that there should be a little resistance to the meat on the bone.  It should release gently, but not just slide off. They were delicious, however, just not at the level of perfection that the brisket was inhabiting. The sausage, too, was a simply seasoned.  It was cooked perfectly and had a good snap to the casing. There are three different sauces available on the tables at Franklin (espresso, sweet vinegar and Texas style) which is quite a concession for a Central Texas BBQ joint.  Texans are pretty opinionated about not needing sauce with their BBQ.  I'm with them on the brisket.  It would be a crime to cover up something cooked so perfectly with anything.  Ribs, on the other hand... Well, what can I say?  I feel that pork ribs work well with a bit of sauce.\\n\\nSo, do I feel that eating at Franklin Barbecue was worth the 3 1/2 hour wait in line?  The answer is unequivocally, yes. The brisket at Franklin's is cooking at a incredibly high level and the type of experiences that I'm always seeking.

I think that the sheer size of this place adds to the experience.  Especially in the upstairs dining room, you are constantly barraged by cart after cart of yummy looking things (as well as some dishes for more adventurous diners).  Everything that I have tried has been excellent, but there are a few things that really stand out.  Their cha shu bao (steamed bun with bbq pork inside) is addictive.  I am also pretty obsessed with their turnip cakes.  They take a little bit longer to get, as they heat them up to order by your table.  However, the taste of the cakes, especially with the sauce that comes with it, is so worth the wait.  \\n\\nI do have two warnings.  One is to be careful coming here if you aren't used to getting dim sum.  Many of the ladies pushing the carts do not speak a lot of English, and they can get pushy.  Warning number two is to be careful if you have food allergies or other restrictions.  I've gone with vegetarians and people with allergies before, and it's often hard to tell exactly what ingredients are in the food that you are getting.

It wasn't bad but at $4 a pop these giant shrimp did not pack any flavor comparable to their size - as you would expect from southern style peel & eat shrimp.\\n\\n[Buttermilk Fried Chicken] Bone-In 1/2 Chicken portion with Nashville Hot sauce - actually delightful. A must and worth trying.\\n\\n[Aged Gouda Mac and Cheese] Without a doubt the BEST dish of the entire meal. So ooey, gooey cheesy and the red hot Cheeto crust is sinfully delicious - can't go wrong.\\n\\n[Confit Berkshire Pork Belly Cracklings] Huge disappointment.

The menu even looked reasonable.\\n\\nThe next day, I took my partner.  We had the whole gamut: appetisers, wine, two entrees, desert.  The bill was less than $40! \\n\\nThis place is awesome.  The smoked salmon filo pastry appetiser ($6) was stunning: texture, flavour, smokiness. The gorgonzola cheese sauce on the ravoli ($9) (hand made with black pepper) made me have a foodgasm seizure.  The penne with marinara ($10), capers and fish (sardines? anchovies?  I forgot) was well-balanced with the acidic tomato, the salty capers, and well-made pasta.  We finished it off with a very (very) good tiramisu ($3!).\\n\\nWhat I liked most about this place was that the portions were just right in size.  We went in hungry, left stuffed, and didn't have a doggy bag.  But if we went in hungry and only had two entrees, we'd have left perfectly content and without danger of increasing our waist size.  The tiramisu was just the right amount at the end of a great meal--most of the time you pay 6-7 bucks for a pile of tiramisu you don't even want to finish.\\n\\nEverything was fresh and it was good to know that any table scraps or leftover prepped vegetables ended up in the worm bin next door feeding the plants at Pistil's.

She left to go and speak to her manager who had her pull another table and chair to turn our seating into a table for four which was nice of management to do, considering we were already seated with drinks. But I could tell the waitress felt slighted. I told my boyfriend to look at two other tables, which had been placed together for larger parties, which were blocking the isles too... I just thought she was creating a scene that wasn't needed. I remained polite nonetheless, but she seemed frustrated by the outcome. \\n\\nAs for the food, NO!!!! I ordered their wings, which were over seasoned with black pepper and the flour coating was not good to me at all. The gumbo tasted like paste, it was disgusting also. I removed the gumbo from my \\"screen door platter\\" and sat it aside to eat my other choices, and my boyfriend had the gumbo replaced with mac'n cheese. It wasn't good either. They served it scorching hot and to me it seemed old like a huge pot of it had been cooked and then they reheated it or something, NO BUENO. I didn't like the food, my boyfriend enjoyed his. I mostly ate fries and one chicken wing, the best item were the fries. If you like really peppery and smoked chicken then you'll love this place. I will not go back.

I got a Screen Door Plate with pork chop, mac n cheese, and gumbo. Pork chop was done well, lightly battered and fried and the gumbo was yummy and filled my tummy. The mac n cheese was mehh, I've had better. My friends also got screen door plates with a variety of chicken wings, baked beans, collared greens, and sweet potato fries. I was not a huge fan of any of the items (and neither were my friends). I'm not really sure if we ordered the wrong dish (and had really high expectations), but I was expecting a lot more flavor from the food. The food was good but not the best that I've ever had.

Good texture and crunch on the outside, but the blue cheese was a bit much for me.\\n\\nCrispy pork belly had its ups and downs. The crispy part was great-- but there was a big fatty chunk that was basically inedible. I know pork belly always has serious fat, but I prefer it cooked so that the fat is less fluffy-squishy and has a little more of a bite to it. The grits that accompanied it were really great, though.\\n\\nSkate cheeks with kumquats and hazelnuts were excellent-- the kumquats were the perfect touch of acidity, though the hazelnuts could've been chopped a bit more to avoid a mouthful of nut.\\n\\nI honestly can't remember what the last dish we got was, to my dismay.

Needless to say, the burgers weren't great and for the price of almost $25 for 2 burgers, fries and a coke, way too much! I'd rather go to Red Robyn for their Tavern Burger and fries for $6.95.

Perhaps they were having an off night? I should have known when I got the caprese salad and the mozzarella wasn't fresh. It was literally like the precursor to the shredded mozzarella that comes in a bag (rubbery and all). I don't mind the mozzarella that comes in a bag to make a pizza but I have never seen it served with caprese and certainly never at an Italian restaurant. My kids ordered margherita pizza. The dough was good but there was so much cheese on it that it was difficult to eat. I would expect that from Papa Johns but not a restaurant that is toting themselves as Italian and calling it a margherita pizza. My husband ordered shrimp scampi linguini. It was fine but nothing special and the shrimp was overcooked. He was a little disappointed that no one even offered him fresh Parmesan (or even not fresh...). I ordered the trout which was fine (albeit overcooked) but also nothing special. The bread was good...so a plus...? \\n\\nThe poor waiter came over and asked us if everything was ok and there wasn't even anything to complain about because it was obvious that this is a larger kitchen issue and not just an isolated meal.

The young lady that was my server didn't seem to know the menu very well. I asked her a few questions about the ribs and such, but she had to ask someone else for the answer. I don't believe that's her fault. I feel that responsibility falls on her training from management. The GM did stop at my table, which was a nice gesture. The decor of the restaurant is great, along with the patio overlooking Creekside. I'm not sure I like it better than City BBQ, but it is a nice alternative.

The Oakwood's contemporary hunting lodge d√©cor offers the perfect cocktail of urban sophistication and rustic manliness with a dinner menu that ranges across a respectable variety of animals. On land: pig, cow, boar, duck, cornish hen; at sea: octopus, albacore tuna, mussels and clams, branzino. A \\"menu dictionary\\" on the left-hand side actually spells out that branzino means \\"sea bass (originally European).\\" But there's no pretension at this self-named \\"Canadian bistro\\"; there's just no point in trying to water down the fact that chef Mike Robbins has created a truly exciting menu with carefully sourced ingredients.\\n\\n= = = D I N N E R = = =\\n\\nMy family and I came for a late dinner on a game night. The music was still deafening when we walked in, but by the time we sat down, our host realized he needed to turn down the volume so that we could actually talk. It was nice that we didn't need to ask him to do so. Service continued to be courteous and attentive throughout the evening. We ordered a variety of dishes to share:\\n\\nFRIED OCTOPUS ($7) was the first thing I put in my mouth and I was ready to pack my bags -- out of sheer satisfaction. Each crispy yet tender cephalopodian morsel was laced with just enough bacon aioli to pack a the perfect smoky punch. But what I found myself really admiring in this dish was the use of pickled shallots. They really tied everything together.\\n\\nCAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI GRATIN ($6) was good, too, with an in-house smoked cheddar sauce, but it wasn't anything you haven't had before. All the same, it's good to eat your veggies.\\n\\nWARM KALE SALAD ($10), on the other hand, was a knock-out. With cauliflower and brussel sprouts. OK, it's all the familiar vegetables that are currently enjoying their 15 minutes of fame -- you know, the ones you dreaded eating as a kid but are now cool to pay money for -- but all of them were well-prepared and tied together with a rich yet refreshing lemon parmesan dressing. \\n\\nTHE BURGER ($15) was solid and cooked on the rarer side of medium, rather than the other way. And I like that. What distinguishes this burger, besides the patty, are alfalfa sprouts (which serve as a sponge to soak up the aioli) and black-and-white sesame seed bun. Honestly, I think the bun didn't really work: it reminded me too much of a bagel, and it was nearly as hard as one, on the surface. It's a cool concept, though some kind of brioche bun would have facilitated oral access to the stellar ground shoulder patty.\\n\\nDESSERT ($6 each) was served in half-sized Mason jars -- very cute and \\"rustic\\" chic. We tried the bumble berry cheesecake, which was a tad too heavy for my cheesecake liking; the graham crumb crust on the bottom wasn't light enough. The chocolate coated honeycomb floating in vanilla custard, on the other hand, was divine; it was heavenly with a bit of crunch naughtiness thrown in. Order it.\\n\\n= = = B R U N C H = = =\\n\\nYes, dinner was so good that I returned with a different group for brunch two days later. It was just as exciting and delicious, but we had more \\"but...\\" reactions. All dishes are $11, except the burger for $15. Coffee was strong and frequently topped up.\\n\\nCORNED BEEF HASH, for example: delicious hash browns (it's like the fries at dinner, but diced up! yum!), perfectly poached eggs, awesome grainy mustard hollandaise, BUT... the house corned beef itself, while flavorful, was sliced deli-style and with the grain, such that it was too dry and fibrous. There was plenty of it, though. \\n\\nBRAISED SHORTRIB had nice fried eggs and potato pancake, BUT... the meat itself, while nicely braised, wasn't particularly interesting to the palette.\\n\\nALBACORE TUNA NICOISE BENEDICT was fascinating in terms of the hybridization of two popular and very different dishes. The slices of fresh tuna were seared and otherwise raw. BUT... their delicate flavour was overpowered by the corn muffin base, which made everything taste like cornbread. Besides that, muffins were rather too crumbly as benedict foundation. \\n\\nTHE LUMBERJACK may actually be the more reliable dish here. Nothing you haven't seen before -- it's a rather traditional breakfast -- but all the components are well executed."},{"name":"Charlies Bodega","address":"1220 Main St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Someone at LaBottega told me about a sandwich called the Myrtle and I finally made it in and tried one this week.

First time I went, the fries (un-cajun) were decent. The second time (cajun) they were gross and bland, except kind of spicy. The idea of the fries is great though, they always use different potatoes and list the type and farm on the board. I guess they could always be slightly different, but it seems they always make them pretty mushy. \\n\\nHowever, I just can't give the burger less than 4 stars. It is freaking delicious. The meat on it's own tastes fresh and delectable. The bun is thin, so it kind of melts and fuses to the burger. Although I generally prefer the bun to stand up to the sauce, this merging of bun/burger is quite addicting. I love the customization options, and how cheap a burger can be with all of this stuff added. Most places will charge about $12 for a bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos, bbq sauce and grilled mushrooms. A lot of additions are up to $1 each. So this is almost half price! \\n\\nI couldn't believe other reviewers saying this is expensive, a double bacon cheese burger with all the fixings is $6.19!!! A little burger is $4.89 and it's not little, it's a regular size burger. Small fries ($2.89) is more than enough to share between 2-3 people. Our entire meal was $12.67 for 2 burgers and fries.

Having sparked a fan frenzy no less than Ansel's Cronut and even a cottage industry of vendors selling sodas and renting chairs to the line it was just after 9:00am when I arrived at 900 East 11th and taking a seat with my laptop on the cracked pavement I waited with perhaps 200 others - the \\"sold out\\" sign hung just after 10:00am, well before a customer had even walked through the door.  Clearly an 'event' as much as a restaurant it must be said that both the pitmaster and his team have done a remarkable job with their success as quantities are estimated prior to opening and orders are streamlined as best as possible by the smiling staff, but as with anything prepped to order the line of the shabby-wooden shack moves slow - my $25 tray of food finally procured just after noon, the turkey unfortunately gone by 11:35.  At this point facing not only the expectations of its name but that of such a wait it was with the fabled brisket that I began and with a thick smoke ring plus ample juice beneath just salt and pepper I must say the flavor was immense, but so was the fat - a thick layer rendering part of the slice nearly inedible and a damned shame compared to the melting ribbons at Pecan Lodge and La Barbeque.  Moving next to two pork selections, the pulled version underspiced and forgettable compared to the good stuff in KC but the ribs proving excellent as meat slipped off the bone unaltered by sweetness allowing the smoky pork sapor to shine, it was with dessert that I concluded and saving my thoughts on the outsourced options from Cake and Spoon to another review I'll simply suggest you not skip the Banana Pudding, available only at Franklin - itself perhaps worth at least an hour-long wait, but not three...much like the 'cue."},{"name":"Wink & Nod","address":"3 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Decided to check this place out due to the rave reviews on yelp and all the chatter on twitter- we are glad we did. \\nFirst impression - the building looks lovely and mysterious from the outside.

The pricing of the entrees ranged from about $20 to $50, so not cheap southern food by any means. I guess you pay for the \\"sophistication\\" of the sophisticated southern food.\\n\\nI ended up going with the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and substituting the garlic collard greens with the collard greens kimchi. My girlfriend went with the shrimp and grits. \\n\\nThe fried chicken was very delicious. The breading itself was very well seasoned and flavorful. According to the server it's the best fried chicken he has ever had, but I can't say that I share the same feeling. The mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth, but nothing spectacular. The collard greens kimchi really fell short and \\"soured\\" the entire dish for me. It was extremely salty and almost inedible. This is coming from a guy who loves Korean kimchi. I tried to pass  it on to my girlfriend and the then to our friends but to no avail. I ended up leaving it in the plate. \\n\\nAccording to my girlfriend the grits were nice and and creamy but not too heavy. They were well cooked but the shrimp may have just been a little overcooked but had very good flavor. The portion of shrimp was satisfying. Overall this dish was also slightly too salty. Overall the shrimp and grits were nothing mind blowing, but still a satisfying meal. \\n\\nI do also have to mention that the service towards the middle and end was lacking. We never got asked if we wanted a refill on our waters until we already paid and were about to leave. Our water cups were empty for a long time. This along with the collard green kimchi left a sour taste in my mouth and prevented me from giving a higher score (pun intended). I ended up leaving the place salty about the whole experience. I guess my expectations were too high given the servers enthusiasm about everything on the menu. I am willing to give this another shot if I'm in the area next time."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"5 years later and this place is STILL amazing!

Makes it tricky to get situated and back out as well. When Uchiko opens this could get real messy. \\n\\nI found the breakfast tacos very disappointing. Perhaps I should have gotten them with potatoes. Looking at the menu, those seem like something special. I had a cheese, egg and sausage and a migas both on flour tortillas. The tacos just weren't hot enough to melt the cheese and make it gooey. They weren't as stuffed with filling as many other breakfast taco spots I frequent. I can name 3 popular places that are waaaay more exciting to my palate. \\n\\nNow as I said before the lunch and dinner offerings look way more exciting and I will be updating my review when try a few of those tacos.

Very well informed, informative, and always friendly.\\n\\nThe shrimp, scallops, and grits took the traditonal dish to a new level. But despite upscale trappings, it was still a serious calorie bomb. Such decadence. The perfectly sauteed seafood sat atop a rich pile of savory, buttery, cheesy grits--so fluffy it was more like a baked good than something ladled onto the plate. The seafood-infused gravy was almost over the top, but the balance of flavors could not be argued with. It was good. I felt like I needed something \\"healthy\\" to balance this, and my disinterest in the salads pushed me toward the collard greens.

I was so excited coming here. I heard great things about this restaurant, and the menu was very exciting, they feature great ingredients. Sadly, it was a disappointing and underwhelming dining experience. Perhaps it was a Sunday, but hey, I still expected better.\\nI like the location and the d√©cor. The mood at the bar was nice. They played heavy rock when I was there. I thought that was a nice touch. \\n\\nFirst impression: The staff was so uninspired. For a restaurant with an exciting menu, exciting music, open kitchen, great setting, the staff was half asleep. I sat at the bar first, ordering a Fogcutter, which has rum, gin, brandy, orgeat, and sherry. You can't go wrong with this drink, it's a great blend and it was listed under Shaken. Great, I am excited. The bartender put it together, shook it gently a few times, the cocktail didn't even have the foam of a well shaken cocktail. She then added way too much lemon and orange juice with a lot a lot of ice. When I tasted it, it honestly tasted like a college dorm screwdriver. \\n\\nWe ordered four plates of food. The first was the sea bass crudo. It was completely flat in taste profile. Nicely plated, but the portion was ridiculous, sliced so thin, and underwhelming. This dish was missing some acid balance. I don't think the sea bass was fresh because it was missing the texture of fresh suzuki, though that could be due to Sunday...\\n\\nSecond plate was brought out by another food runner. The thing with the food runners here is they mumbled the plate name then run away before they finish saying the names or the ingredients. I thought it was poorly trained. This guy put down the plate, mumbled something then walked away. It wasn't what we ordered. It took me over five minutes to get the attention of the waitress, who was talking to other waiters. She came over and literally said, \\"Oh that's not what you ordered\\" then walked away with the plate. She should had left it there since we already played with it with our forks to see what was in there. She forgot to apologize, so a few minutes later she came back and said sorry, though expressionless, and somewhat pointless. \\n\\nThe next three dishes came out, the carpaccio, the grilled mackerel, and the crispy Berkshire pork belly. Again, we chose this restaurant for its menu and the ingredients looked fantastic. Sadly, the taste was so flat, nothing jumped out at you. There was no complexity on the palate, no umami, no immediate freshness. I sat there somewhat confused as to the reason why. Most of the dishes were missing the element of acid; the flavor profile was way too dark. Only the mackerel which came with a celery root remoulade introduced a brighter flavor. I wondered if these were leftovers from Saturday, because it was so flat and just didn't have the freshness of freshly cooked food. This was a letdown, but maybe my expectation was too high. \\n\\nWhen I was eating half way through the second course, some guy came over and said, \\"I am going to take your plates\\" Then he just took our plates and gave us new ones. WHY? We were in the middle of eating a meal. Shouldn't you wait for a new dish to start before changing plate? Shouldn't you wait for me to finish what I am eating and maybe ask me before apologetically yanked my plate away?"},{"name":"Chau Chow City","address":"83 Essex St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We go to Chau Chow City for their dim-sum.

I think we made good choices for appetizers.\\n\\nChicken karahi kabob- Chucks of white meat chicken served on a sizzling plate with a tomato, onions and peppers. The chicken was tender and I really like the veggie mixture that sizzled on the plate.

I know this sounds a bit nitpicky but taco places are the types of restaurants that you can and do normally frequent, unlike steakhouses or upscale sushi joints.  In that case, a larger selection is a plus.\\n\\n3) The tacos on the whole might just be a bit better.

We looked at the menu ahead of time so the bf and I knew we wanted to order from their lunch menu (11AM-3PM daily). We both opted for the bento box, me with the kung pao chicken and him with the unagi (eel) teriyaki. Each bento box comes with white rice, miso soup, salad, edamame, 2pc pork gyoza, 2pc shumai, 1pc each of sweet potato and zucchini tempura, and a 3pc spicy tuna maki. At $11, this is such a steal!! We didn't think it would come with a lot but it was so filling! We actually thought it was going to be tiny so we decided to also order the salmon wonton chips appetizer. There was definitely no need because we ended up \\"forcing\\" ourselves to finish our food. On top of that, we each thought our bento boxes were amazingly flavorful.\\n\\nMy only negative comment though would have to be that the salmon wonton chips were a disappointment. Although beautiful in display, the salmon itself was very bland. Maybe it's because I don't enjoy straight up raw fish (needs to be dipped in soy sauce or something) but my bf enjoyed it. He actually ended up just eating the salmon and forgetting the chips. In the end, we were too full so we had to leave maybe 1/3 of it behind since it's not really something you can take back.\\n\\nTLDR: Salmon wonton chips is a pass but bento boxes are a A++.

For a giant bowl of salad they only give you one small one ounce of dressing and they charge you $1.60 PER dressing. The second burger we ordered took over 30 minutes to come out once the place was almost empty.

It's umami. \\n\\nI went to Austin in early August when it was 100+ degrees every day, so we'd drive by a couple times to check out the line and decided that the wait in the heat wasn't worth it. After eating at a horrible bbq place, I just couldn't end my stay in Austin that way and made it a mission to eat here. We showed up early and waited. They do have people getting an estimate of how many are in line as to ensure that those waiting could get bbq. So even if you see people coming out with bags of food, don't be discouraged because if they haven't told y ou to leave you'll probably end up with food. By the time you're sitting down with your hands covered in sauce, you'll forget all about the wait.\\n\\nEverything was so good. The older gentlemen we sat next to explained the different sauces.

People waiting in line for an hour plus for BBQ is rediculous. Historically it was food for the poor. It's the worst, cheapest, toughest cuts of meats smoked so long they are edible and delicious instead of dog food. The prices here and the long lines for no reason are a slap in the face to the history of the craft. They could easily make enough to not have this problem and expand in size. BBQ above all should be unpretentious. If you're going to pretend to be some scarce, gourmet product, live up to that instead of being another traditional BBQ place with a little more jazz and a little more budget for marketing.\\n\\nThat being said, the food is good. If you show up around 4 pm, there is no line, and if you mention it to the people working there you'll get a smug reply about how they are out of this or that meat because so many people came. I didn't think any of their food was remarkable or original enough to warrant the 50% price increase over a normal BBQ restaurant's prices; excepting the espresso sauce, which was excellent. \\n\\nAs far as being a marketing genius, sure, Franklin's nailed it.

They just dumped sugar into iced tea, which makes \\"sweet\\" an adjective, not a noun. We asked our server. They don't know how to make sweet tea. That's like drawing G's on a canvas bag with a sharpie and calling it Gucci.\\n\\nWe ordered the Pitboss Sampler because it includes all the non-fish meat on the menu. Sadly, everything was not worth having. I didn't mind adding a little extra vinegar to the slightly-bland pulled pork, but I started getting irritated when I realized that the brisket and roast chicken didn't soak in any flavor. But I broke down when I read the menu disclaimer that the ribs were deliberately made to NOT fall off the bone because it \\"takes away the flavor\\". I bit into a rib and realized that the meat wasn't falling off the bone because it was flavorlessly dry rather than \\"flavorlessly\\" tender. I think I shed a tear. And I think the salt from my tear significantly improved the flavor of the fried chicken.\\n\\nThe only sides/food items worth having was the Collard Greens and the Baked Beans. The beans are the reason we're called Beantown, and the collard greens were the best I've ever had. The greens were cooked but just cooked enough to retain some of the original veiny texture. A must-have if you come to Soul Fire. \\n\\nAlthough Soul Fire may rave about their 4 different barbeque sauces and NC vinegar, but good barbeque doesn't need a dipping sauce.

We ordered a handful of tacos, queso, multiple salsas, some guac and a couple cocktails. I'd like to give this place the benefit of the doubt because I see so many other great reviews, but despite how hungry we were it was definitely still a miss for us. I don't think we finished anything we ordered (except for their queso, which I'm craving as I write this).\\n\\nTHE BAD\\nThe Roja and Verde salsas tasted like nothing more than blended tomatoes/tomatillos.. we could barely taste any additional spices or heat. We even ordered the ghost pepper salsa (which we legitimately thought was worcesterchire sauce sent to our table by mistake) and even that barely had any heat to it. \\n\\nThe guacamole was bland and we almost asked the server for some salt to at least set it apart from smashed avocado. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 batches of chips - the 1st was waaaay greasier than the 2nd. I was surprised that they served it to us because there was such a noticeable difference between the two.\\n\\nNone of the 5 tacos we ordered were good. All of the meat was overcooked, none of the meat had enough flavor. One of the tacos was made with their spicy hard-shell, which I imagined would be similar to spicy nacho doritos (delicious), but it was more like a hard shell taco dipped in an unsalted cumin and chili powder mix. Overall - everything needed some salt. \\n\\nThe cocktails weren't terrible, but also weren't great. The ideas of their drinks were great and the ingredient list looked really good, but the drinks were imbalanced. Neither drink tasted like it had a full shot in, but it's possible that there was just too much of one of the other ingredients, resulting in weak beverages. \\n\\nTHE GOOD\\n\\nAside from our batch of super oily chips, this place seems to have relatively healthy food, which we really appreciated. If the menu items were a little more balanced (juicier meats, a little salt on everything, more heat to the salsas, stronger drinks), this place could be healthy and really delicious.\\n\\nThe queso was sooooo good.

Our apps were momos (Nepalese dumplings - we had the chicken). I loved this dumpling and the curry dipping sauce it came with (actually tasted a bit like the tikka masala sauce). The chicken lollypops were crispy, meaty and flavorful. There was another app, the name of which I've forgotten, which was like a chicken and veggie stir fry. The chicken had a strong mustardy flavor, which I didn't love (despite the fact that I'm a big fan of mustard). \\n\\nI ordered my standby - chicken tikka masala, and it was very good - not really so good it can be distinguished from my other favorite places like Teji's, Tarka, or Clay Pit, but good nonetheless.

This tasted like straight up indo-chinese (leaning toward traditional Chinese) to me, and I was given to understand that Nepalese isn't quite so \\"chinesey\\" but whatever the case, I loved those noodles, and when I have a lo mein (which is what it was really like) craving, I'd go here over any of the Chinese places I know of in Austin. \\n\\nI sampled a bit of everyone's food, and everything was really tasty.

Return to the end of the line as fast as possible. Once it is your turn to enter calmly walk inside the restaurant and seat yourself. It may even be common for random people to offer to sit with your party if a larger table opens up because the restaurant is pretty small.

I don't like waiting either, but if I see my waiter busy then I'm not going to act like an ass. We also got the privilege of being seated outside, but right outside the bathroom window. Talk about unpleasant. No one wants to think about the bathroom when they're trying to eat. Plus the rolls of toilet paper lining the windowsill were a real class act. And there's no hiding it because it was the evening and every time someone went in there the light came on for the entire patio area, and it was frequent. A simple solution this disgusting problem is to have appropriate window treatments. Maybe try a blackout curtain. Then there's those tiny two person tables where there was not enough room. I hate those things. I don't like being cramped at the table. They are the worst! \\n\\nNo if only the food were good. Sigh! Started with the hushpuppies that were completely overcook, but the pepper jelly dipping sauce was good. Fried chicken was very spicy, but the mashed potatoes and gravy were fine. Coleslaw left a lot to be desired. We also had the shrimp and grits. Very skimpy with the shrimp and they leave the tails on so you get the pleasure of getting your hands all dirty digging into your food to remove them. Yay! Grits were a complete mushy mess - way too overcooked. \\n\\nAll in all it was a waste of time and money. I don't understand the fascination with this place."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My friend raved about this place...thought it was really interesting.

It has no equal.  However, when it comes to something as subjective as taste where there's no yardstick to measure the flavor, no clock to time the texture, and definitely no scale to weigh the enjoyment, how do you quantify the unquantifiable?  \\n\\n     At Franklin BBQ, there is a loyal following, an almost cult-like obsession, where fans including the locals of Austin to foodies from all around the world, line up for hours since the early mornings to get a taste of the legendary smoke meats masterminded and perfected by Aaron Franklin since 2009.  Even at 7 am on an unusually cold Austin Sunday morning, the faithfuls are already standing in place for the 11 am opening.  Some have been there before, while many others are experiencing Franklin BBQ for the first time.  Everyone was in good spirits despite the many hours in the near freezing temperatures and overcast skies.  The cordial and cheerful staff checks in on everyone in line to guesstimate the amount of meats people were going to order while mixing in some friendly chit chat.  When the door finally opened, there is a sense of excitement, not too unlike Apple fanboys waiting all night to get their hands on the latest iPhone, except this happens every day, six days a week.  The line progresses smoothly as everyone already knew what they were ordering.  The beef brisket is unanimously the star.  If you don't order the brisket, you might need to rethink your life choices.\\n\\n     Taste is subjective, but by any metric you use, there's no denying this is one of the juiciest and the most tender beef brisket in existence.  There is a balance of flavor and a consistency throughout each and every bite.  To take such a difficult cut of meat and transform it into something so sublime and unexpected is nothing short of magical. I have yet to find its equal, let alone come across one that is superior.  \\n\\n     As for the other items on the menu I managed to try that day, the pork ribs were good, the sausage is tasty, and the smoke turkey, while being borderline dry, still had an addictive quality to it.  They were all fantastic, but the beef brisket is what put Franklin BBQ on the map and into the upper echelon of BBQ joints in a city already famous for their BBQ.\\n\\n     So how does one quantify the unquantifiable?  As with any discussion about who or what is the best and the greatest, this is a debate that has no definitive end.  Not everyone will be a fan of the beef brisket.  If you are more into A5 Wagyu beef straight from Japan, no amount of culinary wizardry can transform a beef brisket to your liking.  Whether you like Franklin BBQ will all depend on you and your mileage will vary.  However, with the sheer number of people's love and devotion to this place and their food, there is a very strong case that it is, by far, the best."},{"name":"Wrapini's","address":"7 Bourbon St","city":"Peabody","stars":"2.5","text":"New owner is horrible.

So, I will answer some FAQs below.\\n\\nTo give a frame of reference, I visited in a party of 4 on a Saturday morning, the Saturday before UT started school.\\n\\nWhen should I go?\\nFranklin opens at 11 am. I personally arrived at about 8 am and got to the counter to order my food by 11:30 am. I would suggest arriving at least before 8:30 am in order to get in line AND be in the shade for the entirety of your wait (unless you bring an umbrella/parasol like some late-comers did). \\n\\nDo you really just stand in line for 3.5 hours?\\nMost people don't actually stand. Many visitors will personally bring their own folding chairs. Some even bring coolers with alcohol or drinks or chips. Another cool perk about going early is there are cheap folding chairs available for free use so my friends just sat in line talking and napping.\\n\\nWhat if I have to use the restroom?\\nThey have restrooms inside that they let you use even before doors officially open. There's also AC inside (so I would definitely go use the restroom even if your bladder feels okay).\\n\\nWhere do I park?\\nThere is a decent amount of street parking on the north and west side of barbecue joint. I had no trouble finding parking.\\n\\nWhat do I get? (FOOD REVIEW)\\n4 college-age guys. 3.5 hours in line. We were hungry. So, we ordered 1.5 lbs of brisket, 8 total ribs, 2 sausage links, and a quart of potato salad. With the order you get jalape√±os, sandwich bread, pickles/onions and sauce. The potato salad was okay, nothing spectacular, but a good side with the barbecue. The sausages were surprisingly good! I typically am not the biggest fan of sausages, but I would definitely get these again. The brisket was ever so slightly too dry and too spicy (too many spices) for my taste although my friends loved it. My personal favorite were the RIBS. You know the ribs are going to be good when you pick up the ribs and the meat literally just falls of the bone because of how tender and juicy the ribs are. Ribs ribs ribs\\n\\nHow much will I spend?\\nOur order was $85 total ($21 per person). We didn't get any alcohol or drinks. \\n\\nDefinitely not somewhere I would go every week because of the half day time commitment required to eat here, but if you love Texas barbecue, and have a morning to spend in Austin, you know where to go."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Took 2:30 in line to get the brisket but it was worth the wait.

They serve in small plates, so we ordered eight dishes: \\n- Brussel Sprout Salad - $10 **\\n- Sweet Potato Hasselback - $10\\n- Calamari a la Plancha - $12\\n- Roasted Cauliflower - $14\\n- Tuna Poke - $16\\n- Squash Stuffed Cappelletti - $16 **\\n- Crispy Trout - $17\\n- Grilled Hanger Steak - $22 **\\n\\nThe best items: **Brussel Sprout Salad**, the **Cappelletti**, and the **Steak**.  The Brussel Sprouts were roasted perfectly and drizzled in a delectable sauce.

The dishes were alright, but it could definitely be better as in tastier with a greater attention and emphasis to quality as opposed to quantity.  Nonetheless, they were piping hot and fresh.  I am disappointed with the shrimp dumplings, since they are my must-haves at any dim sum meal.  The ones' here suffer from a soggy skin with a powdery after taste; the shrimp filling was not as firm and packed with shrimp as I would have liked; falling apart into pieces after I dropped it from my chopsticks.

I stuck with the restaurants namesake and ordered the Lamb Shwarma.  The shwarma enormous and completely delicious.  The lamb, which I could see slow roasting in the window, was perfect with the hummus and vegetables\\nThe only downside was the rice pudding I decided to spring for after the meal.

Places like JM Curley's, Silvertones, the new Columbus Cafe remind me of this spot. \\n\\nOverall I really liked it here. The bar is great, as I am a total fan of the wrap-around aspect of it and it's size. When you see the bar take up about 55% of the restaurant sq footage, it provides you a clue as to what's really good here. Decent menu, with a Bunch of options in terms of little finger foods, etc., entrees were okay, not great, but good. I ordered the Cod dish and I thought it was good, maybe not worth the $20 price tag, but good. Come here for the signature drinks, and to sit at the bar. It's fun to watch the dudes mixing and shaking. It also gets fairly loud in the restaurant, so be prepared to bring your yelling voice...\\n\\nI had a good time here, will definitely be utilized this place more often as an upper scale bar relatively close to where I live and work.

That's hard to do and super bonus points for making a 10in and a 14in! That is super rare. \\n2. So many different sauce options!!! Typically we go with the spicy sauce which isn't spicy at all but just adds something extra for flavor. \\n3. Amazing fresh toppings. So many toppings and if you go in you see them making it and know they aren't picking their nose in between your cheese and veggie choices. \\n4. ALL the toppings you want for ONE price!!! Thats craziness in the best way. Note- Gluten free crust does cost a little more. $2 I think. \\n5. Super friendly staff. Always nice and most times pretty funny. \\n6. The limoncello cake is amazing. Clearly BF didn't eat that but it he really missed out! \\n7. They deliver.

One thing I found odd was that they did not open my bottle of wine in front of me. It was not a real big deal, but it was a nice/expensive bottle I'd been saving for the past 7 years and it was opened away from the table and brought to me in the decanter. I personally would have liked to keep my eyes on it from open to pour. That being said, the wine was fine and no harm done. The only nit-picky thing that I would knock against is the bar using jiggers - in a place that charges a lot for your typical mixed drinks (gin and tonic), it looks a little cheap and overall the drinks tasted a tad weak.

The fried mac and cheese appetizer is amazing, the ribs are flavorful, and they give you a fantastic selection of BBQ Sauces to use.  The only reason this isn't 5 stars for me is becuase I've gone a bunch of times for dinner and I feel like they could do a better job of making it feel like a lively joint.

I am happy to say that this place and their food did not disappoint me.\\n\\nI got the Eggs Benedict because I love them. To me they are the quintessential breakfast food. Them, along with biscuits and gravy and Chicken and Waffles, are classic breakfast dishes that have to be done right. When I was looking at the menu, the fried green tomato immediately caught my eye. Fried Green Tomato in a Eggs Benedict? Now I have to give it a try. When it came out, what a breakfast. The portion was very sizable. The biscuit, very dense, but in a really good way. I'm talking about a really wonderful biscuit that had nice texture on the outside and was moist and warm on the inside. It was complemented by a perfectly fried green tomato that was both tart and savory because of the wonderfully crisp batter. The hollandaise sauce was a perfect consistency, not too thick but also not too watery. It had the right amount of acid in it to really cut through the richness of the egg and bacon. All in all, a fantastic breakfast. The interior decor was great as well. A very hipster vibe that feels lively and gives you a sense of energy and excitement as you wait for your food.\\n\\nThere's only two things I would like to see a bit differently. 1. I wish the coffee was unlimited refills! I love my coffee and it would have been nice to have more than one cup. 2. The potatoes au gratin, while delicious, I knida wished it was more au gratin like with a crispy top and a creamy interior. The ones I got today were almost more like crushed potatoes than au gratin in my opinion. But again, it doesn't take away from the flavor or how much I enjoyed the food today.

I walked 7 blocks just to pair this experience with my favorite Texas beer, Shiner Light Blonde. I'm telling you I was committed lol I, my twin and his gf were in for the experience in eating of mammoth proportions. I've eaten at the Salt Lick which was amazing, Smitty's in Lockhart which was damn good but Franklin BBQ is beyond just flashy adjectives and clever word play. We got lucky and came on Saturday which is beef ribs day. Omg, in my ooinion anyone can feature pork ribs but heavenly bovine beef ribs are reserved for those who are true meat aficionados,  not amateur BBQ eaters plus they are damn pricey at about $25 a rib which is about 1 lb or so. Get your finances in order if you want to sample all their meat offerings. You might need a cosigner cuz when you buy with your eyes like I did you worry about the consequences later lol That basic rub of salt and pepper on the top was a bit salty for me and that's only because I never salt my food anywhere I eat. I eat it the way it comes to my plate or in this case tray and butcher paper.  Moist, fatty, fall off the bone with no need of an intervention.  I forgave the salt cuz it was just magical. The brisket with perfect bark and tear apart so easy it might be made of expensive tissue. My cousin who has been here before said melt in your mouth. I won't disagree.  Right at that first bite I knew I would do a four hour plus wait again like a man in waiting room expecting a new born. In a heart beat I would do this. This place is bucket list royalty type of living. I don't even want to complain that they don't carry Shiner. I'm more than willing to bring my own next time since they are BYOB friendly. The only knock and it's not on the place but on the fans who can get ridiculous with their joiners. They make the line longer for those of us who have set aside our day, that's right, a day to do this! Franklin BBQ encourages people not to take advantage but they do by making wait at least an hour longer than it needed to be. Now I know why establishments don't like sitting incomplete parties but here they deal with it by asking what you might order beforehand so they know whether to tell you got a shot at some this bbq. I loved all the Willie Nelson playing outside the venue as well. The sausage was good, with great snap but not juicy or moist inside but flavor is top notch. I only ordered a side of beans which were done beautifully with what tasted like beef brisket. I'm a beaner so it was up my alley and I loved they also had cold Big Red in bottles. I told my brothers gf after we were done and I was in a food coma heaven: I can die now. I'm ready!!

I've been very excited about this place, but a little afraid of the menu because every single thing sounded so decadent and fattening.  It is definitely mostly about that, BUT they have some great salads on the menu, and as they add more variety it should become a place where you can be a regular, not just a place where you go for a gut-busting treat.  I had the Ty Cobb salad, which was fresh and tasty.  Loved the smoked chicken on it, and the honey-mustard dressing is made with their own mustard and more like a vinaigrette than the standard H-M.  \\n\\nBecause I had a salad, I felt okay about sharing an order of poutine.  SO DELICIOUS.  Crispy, thin fries (delicious on their own) smothered in wonderful gravy and cheese curds.  I've been wanting to try this Canadian specialty for years and now there's a very tasty version right here in Avondale.  Highly recommended.  \\n\\nMy husband had the Reuben, which he declared the best he's tasted in metro Atlanta.  My BFF had the pork burger, which didn't taste quite the same (or quite as yummy) as I imagined.  More like a country sausage patty.  For dessert we risked total food overload and dove into a large slice of fresh cherry pie with vanilla ice cream -- delicious.\\n\\nThe beverage menu is almost overwhelming, between fresh sodas, egg creams, and milkshakes along with beer and wine and some very interesting soft drinks.  Guests are encouraged to create cocktails by adding liquor to the shakes, sodas, etc.  Love this idea!  I had hot spiced cider with a shot of Sailor Jerry rum... a very generous portion and quite tasty.  One thing they didn't really have was plain old coffee... we got the last cup out of the pot to go with the pie.\\n\\nObviously the decor is fabulous and entertaining and a big part of the appeal.  i was worried that there would be lots of out-of-control kids, since we were there at 5:00 on a Sunday... there were several kids, but they were all quietly watching the Christmas cartoons on the two TVs or otherwise occupied.  Kudos to Jim Stacy for providing entertainment and to their parents for keeping them under control!  Our server was charming (true confession, an acquaintance of mine) and took good care of us.\\n\\nThere's so much on the menu here that I want to try -- I can't wait to go back.

I enjoyed their goat cheese BLT (omg like all your favorite things put together), while a friend had a burger, and another had the eggs/sausage brunch combo. Something I also loved was the portion size to price ratio. They're not trying to make up for quality by adding quantity here. After my sandwich, I felt pleasantly full but not stuffed, and was happy to pay a few bucks less for a smaller portion. \\n\\nThere are two cons to this place, oddly both are regarding their choices in furniture. The bar stools are incredibly narrow....even my size 2 skinny Asian friend found the seat uncomfortable, and the dining tables (at least in the front of the restaurant) are also tiny.

Minimum two hour wait - whether you show up at 9am before they open at 11am or if you come anytime after that.  Your curiosity will be piqued as you view this tremendously long line.  (If it's anything past the entrance stairs, you're already going to wait 30 minutes.  The back of the parking lot is a 2-3 hour wait.)  However, as the story goes, they make their BBQ 16 hours in advance, open their doors at 11am, and close their doors once they've sold out.  By 12:30, the \\"pickins\\" are slim.\\n\\nFYI - the brisket and turkey usually sell out the quickest.  There always seems to be sausage left over at the end of the day.  They recommend about a pound per person.  If you factor in cutting off grizzle or bones, it's not so bad...  I think this is a reasonable amount to order.  We ordered 4+ lbs for 3 people and had a good pound of meat leftover.\\n\\nIt's got a small eating area inside.  I'm going to put it at 40-50 people MAX.  There is an outdoor patio, too.  Let me get to the food, because I really think that's what we're here for.\\n\\n\\nMEAT  -  The reason you wait 2 hours in line.  These are listed in my favorite order, though my friends would have told you 4, 3, 1, 2.\\n        1.  Turkey:  We almost didn't order this.  Why order turkey when there is pork and brisket?  OMG, turned out to be my favorite.  A quarter pound comes out to a half-inch thick slice of the turkey.  IT WAS SOOOOOO MOIST.  Of course, it helped that they dipped it in some kind of turkey drippings / oil / fatty goodness right before serving it.  Has a magic rub on it that makes it super flavorful.\\n        2.  Pulled Pork:  Lawd-al-mai-tee!  Juicy.  Pulls apart so easily.  Om-nom-nom.\\n        3.  Fatty Brisket:  Tender goodness that's juicy, too!  1 slice ~ 1/4 lb.\\n        4.  Pork Ribs:  Literally fell off the bones.  Also has the magic rub that the turkey got.  ~4 ribs = 1 lb.  \\n        5.  Lean Brisket:  Good by itself, but it lacks serious flavor and tenderness.  They put this UNDER our fatty brisket which was smart.  Don't know what it would have tasted like ONLY LEAN.  Methinks it's not worth the calories or the 2 hour wait.  Just go for the fatty stuff.\\n        6.  Sausage:  You know - not my favorite.  I'm picky about sausage.  Tasted fine.  Was not worth a 2 hour wait at all though.  I don't know the weight, but it was about 7 inches long and nearly an inch in diameter.  Or so it seemed.  After all the food, we were disappointed that we ordered two links.  1 link would have been fine to split among 3 people.\\n\\nSIDES  -  If you're wise enough to realize you'll need fiber to get all that meat out of your system.\\n        7.  Baked Beans: They had an interesting taste I could not place.  Beer?  Tabasco?  Smoked?  Different...  This was probably our least favorite.\\n        8.  Potato Salad: Probably my favorite of the sides.  Creamy, good.\\n        9.  Cole Slaw: Made with red cabbage and on the more bitter end of things.  If you're shying away from anything sweet, this might do it for you.\\n\\nOverall, I'm kind of lazy, and so I think back: what was worth the two hour wait?  Well, it would have to be a special occasion for me where I was having an extreme hankering for BBQ.  I might get a half pound of turkey, a quarter pound of pulled pork, a quarter pound of fatty brisket, and one pork rib.  Otherwise, I would have just stayed in Houston area, gone to Rudy's, and only waited 20 minutes top for all this."},{"name":"Tony's Italian Ristoriante","address":"16 W Beck St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"It hurts me to say this, but our homecoming meal at Tony's was not what I had been anticipating.

I would much rather pay a few more dollars than feel short-changed on portion. Our server was MIA due to waiting on a party of 6 right next to us so even though we had 4 courses plus a bottle of wine, we could definitely tell that we weren't a priority.

It was a rollercoaster of a ride, but overall it was definitely a memorable one.  A 4.75 rounds this up to a 5.  \\n\\nYou don't know how many times I've driven by to find at least 20-30 people waiting to get their hands on this ramen, it's like the Gold Rush or something, and I don't have the patience to wait in the cold even though it's gold.  Finally, just before Christmas, I do a drive by @ 8pm and WHOA!!!  No LINE?!?  I'm THERE!  \\n\\nThis Ramen Tatsu-Ya-Virgin-non-Hipster walks in and tries to make sense of the menu, I'm greeted @ the register by Hipster-Gurl (HG).  I'm totally not sure what to order so I ask HG for some recommendations (as I normally do) and just get a blank stare and a little roll of the eyes (as if I'm supposed to already know).  So I can tell she's totally not diggin' me, HG's responses lacked detail and I could tell her patience is wearing so I just went for the #1 Tonkotsu Original and add in a Spicy Bomb.  \\n\\nHG collects my funds, scans the room, and points to a small spot in a crowded bench between 2 couples and tells me to sit there and we'll bring it.  The place is at half capacity so there's plenty of seating and I would love some more elbow room and peace 'n quiet w/ my ramen, so I ask if it's okay to sit at the open bar.  HG signals her approval w/ a nod and I'm on my way - but not until I take a page out of the sitcom history books and compare this experience (long lines, awesome broth, impatience, order now) to the infamous Seinfeld episode:  \\"The Soup Nazi\\".  Maybe I just experienced \\"The Ramen Nazi\\"?  Thank God she didn't shout out:  \\"NO RAMEN FOR YOU!!!\\".  I would have been so devastated....\\n\\nMy ramen soon arrives and it looks quite appetizing, I'm getting the first stages of HG amnesia.  The Spicy Bomb reminds me of the garlicky red paste that's used in Korean BBQ cooking.  I take a sip of the broth - - WOW!  So creamy, delicate, and flavorful.  The 2nd stages of HG amnesia start to kick in, this stuff is damn good!!  I tried to savor the moment and enjoy, but it was so tasty I finished my bowl in a jiffy.  \\n\\nI saw an array of different looking bowls so I asked the bartender for some insight, he articulated how everyone can add in their different toppings and combinations, just pick the base first and go from there.  Now that made sense to me, it was the simple explanation I was looking for in the first place.  Sorry, I guess I'm just a little slower than all these fast-paced-know-it-all-Hipsters, it takes a while for me to digest some new information, but definitely not the food.  \\n\\nNice young guy comes over (Tako) and inquires about my overall experience.  I said the ramen was awesome, the intro and ordering was so-so, and HG wasn't diggin' me.  He listened carefully and put 2+2 together, turns out HG was just filling in the spot on the fly, it's not her usual cup of tea.  He graciously apologized for the inconvenience and will make sure improvements are made.  To secure my comeback he offered to buy me lunch, which I refused, he persisted, I resisted, he then insisted, I finally accepted, so I now have double the incentive to come back.  I mean he coulda just blew me off thinking this ramen is good enough to come back for - - and I would have agreed - - but Taco took customer service to a higher level.  I was really impressed with his professionalism and quality of care, thank you!\\n\\nRegardless of HG, long queues, limited hours, or a full house, this place cranks out the best damn ramen I've ever had and, believe me, it's well worth the waiting, trials and tribulations.

One of our dishes never came - the check did. We asked about the dish \\"Oh, that never came? sorry.\\" Seriously - that was is. I had to ask to have the dish taken off the bill...\\n\\nI could go on - but really, why bother? Some of the food was ok - I thought the biscuits were delicious, the chicken was cold. \\n\\nBut the reason why I wouldn't go back?

Fun atmosphere that manages to walk the line between casual and formal, upscale feel while also feeling comfortable, good noise level. \\n\\nAnd then the food... Considering that prices are comparable to places like West Bridge and Bondir, I would have to say that Alden & Harlow is a better deal for sure. The bf and I shared four plates plus a snack, which added up to $80 total (incl. tax/tip), and we left comfortably full. There is a focus on strong flavors here, which does remind me of what the Kirkland Tap & Trotter does, but I do prefer the greater variety the menu here offers. \\n\\nWe got the smoked cashews as a snack (go for these, I loved the lightly smoked flavor and how the richness of the cashews was balanced by the sweetness of the currants), then the chicken fried local rabbit, crispy Berkshire pork belly, house-made rye pasta, and Washington state mushrooms. Of these dishes, the pork belly was our definite favorite--thick, crunchy skin with the most moist, tender meat underneath that paired so well with the citrus flavor of the kumquats. A close favorite that can be considered more original was the rabbit--I wish I had more details about what kind of seasonings the rabbit was cooked with to make it so flavorful. \\n\\nSomething to remember is that you might want to consider how you're planning your sequence of dishes. We were set on the rabbit and pork, then made the mistake of putting that in first and then taking a little longer to decide on lighter dishes, later asking for the pasta and mushrooms.

It was so good and made such an impression on me that when I got home I had to find out where they were located because I was hooked and needed more.

Their cinnamon rolls are to die for and my only complaints are that I spend too much money, my stomach isn't big enough and I can't decide which one I want, because there's so many options. A great feature too is they have their own simple syrup near all the drinks so you can make your coffee to your preference. \\n\\nThe owner is always present in the restaurant and every time I've been, she is at someone's table, talking to customers, and checking in with guests to make sure their experience is exceptional. \\n\\nThis is a must eat at when in Orlando."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Hard to find if you're a tourist.

We don't go often, maybe twice a year, but when we do we never regret it. Three words to describe this pizza joint are unique, unique, and unique. Okay, that is one word three times, but you get the point. Forget ordering plain old cheese or pepperoni pizza! Get bold and order one of their distinctive, outside the ordinary pizzas. I have never been disappointed! \\n\\nThe crust on most Hot Lips pizzas is thin, ranging from semi-soft to crunchy (I like it crunchy!). The slices are always large and loaded with toppings...they don't skimp on the toppings. The flavors are always rich and make my taste buds do back flips, leaving me always wanting more. And if you are there for the experience, it would not be complete without their bottled sodas. Pear, blackberry, apple, and several other flavors of soda can be purchased by the bottle. They aren't cheap, but they are yummy. Your Hot Lips experience would not be complete without one of them. \\n\\nHot Lips is semi-pricey, but justifiable so. Uniqueness does come with a price.\\n\\nThis place is truly the embodiment of Portland's unique weirdness mixed in with the artsy individuality of the people who live here. \\nTo end your experience on a fun note, take a walk two blocks west and indulge in some Cool Moon Ice Cream for dessert. During the summer you'll walk by a very cool fountain the children can play in. The area is very family friendly, so if you are one of them snobbish types who shun visible children, let me suggest you dine elsewhere when the weather is warm."},{"name":"No Mas!

Granted the server did an okay job on her end, she was obviously overwhelmed, and when the manager finally came to the table after we asked to speak to him (he should have came over on his own when the server told him she did not put in our order and he put it in himself), he told us the best he could do was to discount the appetizer for having us wait for the food and beverage. This might be acceptable if tables who ordered after me weren't leaving from finishing their meal while I was still waiting to even have a plate taken to my table. For being overwhelmed, the server did an alright job,  but management in my opinion lacks what he needs to be successful in the customer service industry. I work in the service industry and manage at a chain restaurant in Atlanta, so I know what good service is.

Both tangy and hot, it was great on the chicken.\\n\\nI also tried Tintin's vegetarian biscuits with gravy.  The gravy was the best vegetarian gravy I've ever had.  It didn't taste like cream of mushroom soup with some other stuff thrown in.  It was the perfect consistency with a good amount of seasoning and vegetables.  The biscuits almost looked like a giant slab of focaccia but tasted like a fluffy and filling biscuit.  Again, the portion was huge.\\n\\nWe managed to finish about 1/3 of our food.

This neighborhood bakery invites you in with open arms. They not only offer some small batch baked goods but customer services with a smile. I have to admit the bagel sandwich options looks good but I had just a little space in my belly before yoga. I had a latte and biscotti and they were perfect. If you like biscotti like the ones you buy at the grocery store, then these will definitely knock you off your feet. I like the anise flavor, which made for a perfect dunk in my latter. I was also offered a taste of their flan and a chocolate chip pound cake. The flan was just like my grandmother and perfectly Cuban and the pound cake was nice and moist. I think this place has a nice home feel but somehow a hint of New York.  Susan was also very gracious and willing to indulge me, that always helps.

We got here at 1pm on a Thursday knowing well about the risk of selling out and trying to get there before the dreadful danger. However when we parked across the street we saw the lawn chair with the \\"Sorry Sold Out\\" sign out. However, there were still about 6 groups eating so we figured they must have JUST sold out and wanted to check it out anyway.\\n\\nWe moseyed on up the fabled truck and found the couple inside the truck cleaning up. They asked how we were doing and we told them that \\"we saw the sold out sign, but wanted to check everything out anyway\\" They were just cleaning up the last remaining brisket left overs (small cuts that were quite on the greasy side) on the cutting board and getting ready to toss them out because they weren't sellable. I think they saw our eyes light up and let us know this was all they had and offered them to us for FREE.\\n\\nWe couldn't take it for free, but they insisted and threw in bread, sides and 6 older sausage links along with it. We threw $20 in the tip jar for this amazing platter of BBQ they just served up to us (photos in the gallery).\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the brisket was pretty greasy and unsubstantial pieces that they were going to toss because they couldn't really sell though. But OMG, this stuff made some of the best BBQ sandwiches I have ever had! Listen to me again. IT WAS NOT UP TO THEIR STANDARD TO EVEN SELL, BUT IT IS SOME OF THE BEST BBQ I HAVE EVER HAD.The flavor was amazing and throwing it on some bread with that espresso bbq sauce.\\n\\nWhat about the sausage you ask? This sausage makes all other sausage seem like playdoh. It's smoky, flavorful, slap-yo-mama snappy. It converted me to a BBQ sausage person. I really can't imagine what this stuff is like fresh and \\"sellable\\".\\n\\nMy wife and I ate all we could of our platter, packed up the remainder and left to take it home.

NOW! It indeed is worth the wait. We got there at 10:15 AM on a Saturday and sat down to eat at about 1:30 PM. Going to Franklin's is more than just going out to eat, it is an experience where you chat with those standing in line with you for hours, read a book while you wait, drink, and even make a few friends. You can definitely tell those that are regulars. Shortly after arriving, staff came out and started asking everyone how much brisket they were ordering to get a feel of where they were going to cut the line - before the place even opened!\\n\\nOnce inside, you do the chit-chat thing with the Man himself, get your grub, and finally make it to your table with the long awaited deliciousness on your plate.I honestly did not know brisket could taste this good - I am no brisket connoisseur, but I have had my fair share of Texas and Argentine BBQ. This was something entirely different. The flavor packed into this brisket is too much for words. It was not until I got to the sausage - which is little more than average, that I noticed the sauces on the table. The ribs were fine as well, nothing to write home about. The sides are not even worth mentioning. \\n\\nI highly recommend getting there early enough to be one of the first few in the door, it is worth getting there at 9 ish to be out of the sun and in the door as soon as they open.

There are special bags for each sandwich you might want to order, and on each bag there is a list of ingredients that are options on the sandwich. You then just check away with whatever you want, which does allow you to order all of the crazy toppings you want without any confusion. When I went to the register they guy was very helpful, and we were able to get two sandwiches, chips, and drinks for under $20, good deal so far. As we were watching them create the sandwiches you can tell that this place just opened and the employees were pretty green. It took them longer than I would expect to create the sandwiches, and I think they have some kinks to work out to get it really up to speed. But in the end, the sandwiches were delicious. I had an Italian and my husband had to steak and cheese. Seating is very limited, so be aware of that if you have a large group.

(15 minutes waiting with 4 people in line) \\nAs we walked into the dining area it looked like people had a food fight going on just minutes before we arrived. Not one table that we saw was clean of food. (Tables were cleared of dishes) food was all over the floors also along with napkins. \\nAt our table sat a half eaten biscuit that the host just brushed to the floor. After sitting in the 75% empty dining area for at least 5 minutes what I guess was the manager came by with a dust pan and broom to sweep up the trash only not the piles of food from around our table and others. Now as we waited for someone to come get our drink order the host continued seating other tables that also still had food on them and he and a waiter this time just went around and brushed the food on the floor from all the tables on our side of the dining area. \\nAnother 5 minutes goes by before a waitress comes to get our drink order yawning the whole time like she just woke up from a nap. We asked for 2 unsweetened tea's and 2 waters. As she was walking back she was stopped by another table that must have been seated long before us because we didn't see them in the lobby waiting line. It looked like she took their drink order also. \\nNow 2 more tables were seated around us and another 10 minutes has passed. After our drinks were received our waitress took our order and again stopped by the same table that still had no drinks delivered. \\nNow only but a few tables were empty and another waitress and waiter started helping with orders. They had no clue who's tables were already being taken care of which was only 2 of about 10-12. Another couple that sat down about 5 minutes after us got up and left. Another 10 minutes goes by a the same manager that did the half ass sweeping comes by and starts taking to tables but you could tell she could care less because everything that the customers complained about was not corrected anytime we were seated. \\nNow 45 minutes after arriving we have food delivered to the table and it's wrong so the food goes back. Another 5 minutes goes by and more food is brought to us but it's only half the order. The waitress comes to check and we let her know what is missing and she says while yawning she will get refills for our now empty drinks. She comes back and pours coke into all four glasses and still no food. We tell her what the drinks were and she gets a pissed look on her face and takes the drinks back and then comes back with 2 teas and leaves. Now we start to eat what food we have. \\nFor me I ordered the chicken fried chicken and my wife has the fried shrimp. She says hers is cold like it just came out the refrigerator. For my chicken I asked for the gravy on the side (never did get any gravy) my 3 sides were slaw, t-greens and fries. My chicken was also cold, dry and hard as a rock. My fries were also the same. The slaw had to be days old because it had a very bad taste to it (more like boiled cabbage with mayo). We asked for the Manager when the waitress returned sometime later to bring the check but after waiting another 15 minutes we got up and went to the cashier and asked for the manager. She got on the radio and she she said she would be back in a minute, while we waited my wife started looking around the store area and you could see it was way more cluttered then normal for them. My wife came back and asked the other cashier about something and the cashier she has no idea where it would be. (I don't remember what the item was) \\nOur cashier comes back after about 5 minutes and says the manager is busy she is sorry about our dinner. No it's on us today you don't have to pay or just pay for the drinks we got zip! The cashier says I'm really sorry but she writes the corporate number on the receipt. \\nAfter being their a hour and 45 minutes I was not about to wait around for a manager who knew how bad everything is but could care less and hide in the back somewhere.

Thank God we Grouponed this place, or was it buywithme.com?\\n\\nWe started with a few apps.\\n\\nThe Tuna Tartar per the waitresses recommendation was pretty decent although the diced Tuna meat itself tasted a bit watery. If you like Tuna tartare its one of the better apps we tried here. The toasts we nice and crispy and we were pretty pleased with the flavor. It's not Mistral tartar but hey, not bad.\\n\\nCalamari - small portions, crispy but  bland. The marina was  thinned out  and tasteless.\\n\\nAntipasto for two - unbelievably disappointing. This was just about the worst Antipasto I have ever had. The presentation of the proscuitto was horrible and looked as if the chef squeezed the portion into a ball and piled it in the corner of the plate. Worse than that was the fact that the proscuitto itself consisted of 50% fat around the edges. Anyone who enjoys this cured meat typically allows for some fat along the edge, this was repulsive. I was going to take a picture of the fat pile but figured I would spare them the embarrassment. Even after trimming off the fat the actual cured meat in the proscuitto itself was very bland. Definitely not the taste of a Parma or San Danielle. As someone who cures their own Italiian meats I am pretty familiar with the good and the bad. The artichoke was not noteworthy, the roasted peppers and eggplant ok. The grilled toasts that game with the antipasto were chewy and were almost unpalatable, although it may have been the humidity as it was over 90 degrees outside. \\n\\nThe worst thing we had was undoubtebly the Pezzo mushroom pizza. This tasted like the chef had simply spread ketchup on the dough, grilled it ketchup side down then dumped mushrooms over the top and microwaved it.

The buns are fresh, but not warmed/grilled, which would also be nice, but maybe this can be requested.  They also have an extensive list of specialty burgers for $7. \\n\\nThe black and white shake was disappointing, especially for the price ($5).

From the chipped glass that almost cut my lip on my not-so-good \\"Death on Parker Street\\" cocktail (unless you like your cocktails tasting like straight shots of Tequila, then you'll like this), to the bizarre panacotta dessert that looked like it wanted to be a fruit icy from a Taiwanese Bubble Tea joint, our date night was a bust.\\n\\nThe waiter recommended we share 4 dishes between 2 people. The menu must have changed because we didn't see many of the dishes mentioned on Yelp. We had: \\nKale Salad - Way too savoury and you can barely taste the kale, instead, you taste a lot of brusselsprouts.\\nPoutine - This was OK, but I've had better at another restaurant we're a regular at for way less $. Hubby also did not like how the cheese was in chunks rather than thoroughly melted into the fries. Personal preference on cheese presentation here.\\nLamb Shoulder - This was the best dish that night. The gooseberry & turnip was an interesting and very good pairing with the tender lamb. \\nDuck breast - This was OK, not great, but OK. By then, we were stuffed - we should've just ordered 3 savoury dishes.\\nPanacotta - My separate dessert stomach wanted to give them another chance to impress me so we ordered dessert. Bad idea. The panacotta itself was OK, but the lemongrass caramel, lime elderflower granita, etc toppings were NOT a good pairing and hubby had to shove all the toppings aside so it wouldn't ruin the panacotta.\\n\\nNot only did the food disappoint, but so did the service. It's a family style restaurant so every dish is intended for sharing and the price is not cheap. So I do expect my share plate to be switched out for a clean one at least once throughout my meal. Instead, our little plate had sauce from the creamy kale salad mixed with gravy from the poutine mixed with the sauce from the duck, etc. You get the idea. Also our water was never refilled. \\n\\nIt's a 2* instead of 1* because the lamb makes me think this should be how all their food should taste like for all these 5* ratings I'm seeing.

Read other reviews abot the food. I want to share other tips to make your wait less painful. \\n\\nFirst, plan to arrive extremely early so that you can sit in the shadow of the building.

I don't know about cold weather conditions if the building blocks the cold wind. \\n\\nSecond,  bring lawn chairs. Much more comfortable than the asphalt ground.\\n\\nThird, bring cooler of food and drinks. Even though Franklin's opens at 11, you will still wait another hour or two before you feast. Plus you can kick your feet up and rest them on the cooler. \\n\\nFinally, bring something to keep you entertained. Sure, visiting with the other line people will past the time.

However, I'm not sure it was worth $14.25.\\n-Avocado Green Salad (Avocado on Baby Greens w/Ginger Dressing, $6.25): They gave you a good amount of avocado, but the salad was very sparse. This was definitely not worth the price.\\n\\nThe servers were a bit disorganized since one didn't realize my order was ready and at the front cash register. It was a good thing the other server heard me asking about my order, otherwise I would've had to wait around. Overall, I thought the sushi here was ok, but not the best I've had.

I occasionally travel to Fort Worth for work and have dined at the casual Love Shack, the masculine Woodshed and the rustic Lonesome Dove Western Bistro. When we dined at LDB in FTW it was our anniversary dinner in 2012. The cuisine, wine selection and service was exceptional! I was elated when I heard that Tim Love was bringing LDB right here in Austin, TX and I made reservations for opening day.\\n\\nUpon walking in I was enamored with how bright and beautiful the restaurant is. The FT Worth location is dark and romantic and felt very western as you make your way from the same road as the cattle. The Austin location is bright, modern, welcoming however less romantic due to the noise level. It was pretty awesome to see Chef Tim Love on the line making sure dishes were presented well and coming out in a timely manner.\\n\\nWe did enjoy our meal overall but we eat out often and thought some of the dishes were underwhelming for the price point in the area. This is what we tried:\\n\\nWild game fettine - lamb & quail with Texas citrus chili paste. It has slivers of meat paired with house pickles. While it is cool to order this menu item as it is unique to Austin I would save your appetite for the larger plates. - $12 \\n\\nHamachi tostadas - this dish is delicious. It has the tiniest (maybe a 1/2 an ounce) of hamachi topped with cilantro & Serrano on 3 tostadas. While the hamachi tostadas were great I would like to see more fish for this dish. - $12 \\n\\n**Deviled Gulf Coast Blue Crabs- this appetizer is excellent! The dish is two blue crabs stuffed with crab meat and complimented with Lonesome Dove Hot Sauce. - $10 (great quality)\\n\\n***Fireside Snapper en Papillote -  this pleasantly aromatic dish has fresh vegetables perfectly steamed with a hint of mint and a touch of Texas EVOO & lime. I had a striped bass en papillote in Fort Worth and loved it. This phenomenal snapper lived up to my memory of that first experience. I gave Jesse a taste and he agreed it was the best dish of the night. \\n\\nOutside Skirt Steak - this was Jesse's entree. I thought the steak was cooked nicely with just enough pink at the center. While it was delicious it is a rather small portions. The side of porcini fries were decent and came with a nice hollandaise.\\n\\nThe jalapeno cucumber margarita was super refreshing, full of zesty flavors and a bit steep at $15. The cocktail reminded me of the margarita at Chef Love's Love Shack. The wine selection is absolutely exceptional. I enjoyed a wonderful rose and later a Sauvignon Blanc per our waitress' recommendation. Our waitress was super sweet and kind but she often based her wine recommendations on what wines she reportedly tasted that day. I wouldn't normally think this is a big deal however restaurants in this area that also boast an exceptional wine list have a team that is well-versed in both the wine selections and pairings.\\n\\nCongrats to Chef Tim Love and his team on their new Austin venture. This does fill a niche in Austin and I am sure with their true Texas hospitality they will be well received.\\n\\nTip: They are open for lunch serving full sized steaks, offer 1/2 portions of entrees and a variety of meaty sandwiches."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing corndogs!!!!

The BBQ sauces were pretty solid too. Food was probably a 4.5 - 5. \\n\\nService was a 5 out of 5 as our waiter was great and he even took a picture for us. The reason I give the HOB a 4 out of 5 is that it is quite expensive and the menu really only tapers to spicy food lovers. I knew it would be expensive because this is Disney World we're talking about so that was expected.

The filet mignon was perfectly cooked to a medium temperature--very pink on the inside and browned on the outside. It cut like butter and was perfect, especially with the butter sauce it was drizzled with. For the sides it came with grilled veggies and potatoes. The veggies included string beans, carrots, squash and a tomato. All were grilled to perfection with the flavors shining. The potato was actually 2 potato croquet patties on top of mashed potatoes and oh my were they delicious!\\n\\nFor dessert I got the crem brule because it's my favorite! It was nice and crisply candied on top and smooth on the inside. \\n\\nI can't speak to their fish, but they can definitely do a steak right!"},{"name":"House of Blues Restaurant & Bar","address":"1490 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We just left and the food and service was really good.

It somehow all works.  Of course, you gotta like peanut butter, because you are going to definitely feel it throughout.  Actually, she noticed one half of the burger had more peanut butter than the other, but she didn't really care because it was yummy.\\n\\nShe ordered the single hunka love, due to the regular burgers being huge to begin with.  Even a single is pretty big.\\n\\nMine:\\nFirst night: Boursin Burger. But I modified it by having Chipotle Bison instead of the beef burger, and brioche bun instead of onion roll.  It came with a lot of garlic and herb boursin cheese.  It also had applewood bacon, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, lettuce and tomatoes.  \\n\\nI didn't fare well with the modifications, so I can't properly judge it since I didn't have it as it should have been.  It also had way too much of the boursin cheese, so that it felt like every bite was smothered in it.\\n\\nSecond night: Sushi time!  I took an insane amount of time trying to decide which sushi to try.  Mind you, I just started my sushi adventures, so everything non-traditional makes me nervous.  In the end, I opted for a traditional sushi and a weird sushi.  \\n\\nThe California Roll was pretty good.  Being traditional, it's not really that exciting.  It was well presented though and at 8 or so bucks, that's not too bad.\\n\\nFor the weird, I went with Dion's OMG! Roll.  The name didn't help, but the description kept alluring me: \\"Tempura coconut shrimp, kani, English cucumber inside, coated in tempura flakes. Topped with fresh mango,\\navocado, spicy honey marmalade and coconut flakes.\\"   It was very, very good.  It had so many layers of taste, but it felt like a tasty sushi with splashes of tropical smoothies.  I know, weird.  \\n\\nIts presentation was not very appealing.  It basically looked like a greenish caterpillar, and that's me being poetic.  But, the taste won over!\\n\\nDRINKS\\nMy girlfriend asked for a S'mores handspun Shake and it was absolutely amazing. It really tasted like S'mores and awesome shake.\\n\\nIt was so good that I tried out the traditional Oreo and Cookies shake and that was kick-ass too.  Sorry, Johnny Rocket's, this is how you make great shakes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn the cult of the new, The Cowfish is our king.  It was the highlight of my week-long staycation and for someone that craves variety, it made us repeat the experience once more in the same week.\\n\\nThere's so much to try out, especially if you're brave and trust the chef's creations.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is kooky and unique, something that has for example, made Yellow Dog Eats such a staple in the local restaurant fauna.  In other words, The Cowfish has an identity and an attitude, and a welcome one at that.\\n\\nBy the way, the price is $$, which in Citywalk is pretty much a bargain.\\n\\nDefinitely check this new place out!  Oh, do try to reserve tables because it quickly fills up."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Beer place of course but we went there for the food.

The restaurant, though touristy, was well decorated and quite entertaining to look around. The service was excellent that I would give them 5 stars for this. Our waiter was extremely friendly (some may say overly friendly, but to me one can never be overly friendly) and the food came extremely quickly. The food itself is what I am giving 3 stars. To start off we got the calamari appetizers, these were pretty tasty, probably one of the top two things we had that evening. For entrees my friend ordered the \\"whats shakin' tuna bacon sandwich\\". He described this dish as one that is very unique and can only be found at this restaurant, but would never want to find it elsewhere because he did not enjoy it. The sandwich is a fusion of sushi and burgeresque and extremely messy and complicated to eat. The flavors were lackluster and did not impress at all. I split three sushi rolls with my other friend, the Geisha roll, Dion's OMG Roll and the Mad Mango-Cado Roll. Out of the three the geisha roll was the best, infused with a great mixture of lobster and shrimp, the second best would be the Dion's OMG roll and the third the mad mango-cado roll. The last two rolls were nothing to rave about though, I've had better rolls at more simpler and cheaper sushi spots. \\n\\nOverall I would not recommend this place, yes their service was phenomenal and the place is quite interesting to visit, but the food was nothing special nor memorable and the prices just made it more unfavorable for all."},{"name":"ARI Celebration","address":"671 Front St, Ste 100","city":"Celebration","stars":"3.5","text":"We go here occasionally if we are in the area.

The food is fresh and cooked in the open kitchen so you can watch while waiting in line to order. The falafel in particular is delicious and fun to watch being made; the ingredients get fed into a really cool little machine that squeezes the mixture into little balls and then into the fryer. The hummus is the absolute best. The pita bread is warm, thick, and always tastes just baked, and is made in small batches and then kept in an insulated box so it stays warm without being reheated. The line can get long and doesn't always move very quickly (and the space is very tight, so waiting in line is not particularly pleasant), so despite being an order-at-the-counter place, this is not fast food. \\n\\nPrices are a little high.  I often get the falafel hummus salad plate, which comes to over $10, and includes 6 or 7 small falafels placed on a generous amount of hummus, and the salad which consists of shredded lettuce, red cabbage, diced cucumbers, diced tomatoes, pickles, and a ladle of tahini dressing.

Tonight's dinner warrants the effort.\\n\\nI was in the area this weekend and Hunan Pearl was right by the hotel.  Even after the 1star review by Don B. (sorry that free lunch isn't working anymore, but perhaps you should ask them to order something different - might be worth a try), I decided to try.  \\n\\nThat is, I decided to try takeout that wasn't even on the menu.  The staff are all Chinese and are comprised of both Cantonese and Mandarin speakers.  If you ask, they will do their best to oblige.  \\n\\nI ordered:  1) salt/pepper spareribs 2) Hong Siu Tofu (Hong Shao Tofu) 3) oyster sauce gai lan (chinese brocolli) and 4) tomato beef chow mein (slightly thick noodle - they don't have thin egg noodle).\\n\\n*disclaimer*  NY has great food and if you come from there - you generally know what qualifies as good food.  That's the truth - deal with it.  I am Chinese-American originally from San Francisco - I know my Chinese food - and I've eaten well in just about every asian country.  I live in Seattle now (Chinese food is pathetic there) and I drive to Vancouver or fly to SF/LA for my fix.  I will drive to Portland now if I'm heading south and I'll be more than happy to because of Hunan Pearl. /*disclaimer*\\n\\nI was hoping for the HK style of salt/pepper porkchops, but what I got instead, after being assured by the owner that their pork (in Chinese, pork chop and sparerib is virtually interchangeable) was very good quality.  So it is - think of a baby back rib, cut in half, and you have pieces that are 2.5\\" long.  I was thinking that I was going to get a flattened fatty pork chop.  This is WAY better.  Good amount of meat.  Not greasy.  The flavor is intense with white pepper, szechuan pepper oil, salt, soy sauce, garlic, and onions.  I'm hooked.  \\n\\nThis is not on the Chinese-American menu.  (I checked)  You'll have to ask for it.  Just tell the owner or either of the 2 hostesses in the front, that you want the salt/pepper ribs that Alex ordered to go.  They remember my baby girl well.\\n\\nI would seriously go back just for the ribs - they're that note worthy.\\n\\nThe tofu dish is pretty good on it's own, even though it's not exactly the same as what I was hoping for.  The best part though, is their sauce - which is strong with garlic.  The tofu is sliced about 1/2\\" thick and cut in triangles.  I prefer 2-3\\" cubes of silken tofu deep-fried.  But that's OK because the sauce really makes up for it.\\n\\nThe gai lan/chinese broccoli was excellent.  You get the intense flavor from the super hot wok, garlic, and oyster sauce.  I asked for very little oil and the chef was spot-on.  Very tender and sweet tasting.  The gai lan in Seattle really sucks - something is just wrong with chinese produce in the 425/206/253. (I just don't get it)\\n\\nThe tomato beef chow mein was not super, but very enjoyable.  I knew ahead of time that I wasn't going to get crispy thin egg noodles and I was perfectly fine with fresh thicker noodles, Shanghai style.  The sauce was not the common garlicky-sweet red ketchup sauce I was imagining.  Instead, I got some fresh diced tomatos stir-fried with some nice tender beef, mushrooms, onions, scallions, garlic, and carrots.  It wasn't too salty, no MSG, and definitely not the super sweet sauce that gives you a sugar high.  I would get this again - it's good.\\n\\nSo that's my off-the-menu meal.  I can't vouch for their specialty items, like the scallop in the kiwi cream sauce (cringe).  But I will tell and recommend to you their authentic ability to make tasty Chinese food.\\n\\nI was happy with their service and all four dishes came to $42 with tax.  RIce was included too.  That's a decent price, almost cheaper or comparable to Seattle prices.  It is located in a strip mall, but  the interior is very clean and comfortable looking.  I hope this helps you if you are feeling adventurous.  I took a chance and was very very pleasantly surprised.  I'm coming back to Portland and Hunan Pearl - hope it's as good next time.

Upstairs for dinner and drinks with friends, downstairs for the first date drinks, and the other side for what can only be described as \\"I feel out of place because I have boobs but don't have a cowboy hat\\" music night. \\n\\nFirst time for dinner and drinks, we headed upstairs. The server was incredibly sweet about making sure we had our bartender from downstairs make our drinks the way we had while we were waiting and was completely attentive and understanding about one of my friends who has food allergies. She went back multiple times to check with the cook about ingredients and oils and I know that my friend was appreciative since that's not always the case. The food (the burger at least) was tasty, no confusion or delays, and reasonably priced for the amount of food that they place down in front of you. It weirded me out a little that there were parties of people with babies there (not the ones that can actually move around on their own, the \\"won't stop crying til a pacifier or bottle is shoved in my mouth\\" kind) that put a little damper on the vibe of the place, but at that point, it was pretty loud that they barely made a dent in the cacophony of the night. \\n\\nDrinks downstairs at the bar. This might be my new official go to place for the first date drinks as well. All drinks are priced that I don't feel completely ripped off when I get my bill and they're well made. And they've got some interesting choices if you choose to be adventurous with your liquor. Perfect place to sit down with someone new, get to know them between drinks and the game on the tv, but not feel like everyone is watching you knowing exactly what you're up to. It puts you at ease and creates a cozy environment until the guy next to you tries to get off his chair and kicks you in the shins. I'll just pretend that adds to the ambiance of Christopher's. \\n\\nAnd lastly...the other side with the music. I can't really comment because I didn't stay past chugging my beer down with my date when we saw the guys in the cowboy hats come out. Apparently they've got live music every night which I can completely respect, but the cowboy hats, not so much. Sorry fellas.

Yes, the place was busy, but knowing that you'd think they would have made an effort to walk the area a bit to find us, as apposed as a feeble  attempt to call above the den of the crowd. Maybe they should invest in beepers or a PA system when things get hectic! \\n\\nI had a brief discussion with a blondish man with a short beard about our service or lack thereof. He was dismissive, rolled his eyes and only offered a shallow excuse for us being ignored. His actions and expression implied it was our fault. The implications he was too cool to be bothered with us.\\n\\nAfter inquiring about our reservation status again the hostess indicated that a table was ready. Oddly, she immediately started walking away from me to our table without waiting for the group. She never asked if I needed to get the rest of our party or bothered to look back to see if I was in tow. She simply walked away as if all would instinctually fallow her to the table selected for us. I had to quickly run and alert the rest of our party that we finally had a table. By the time I had returned to the spot where I had left the hostess she had completely disappeared. Looking for her, I gazed at the man in passing, the one I had spoken to earlier, I briefly asked him where our hostess might be. He grudgingly indicated a general direction in a smart-ass way, where she might be found. We saw her head pop out from a thrush hold some 20 feet away. This only happened after she had discovered we were unable to keep up with her as she sauntered off earlier like a moopy cow chewing cud.\\n\\nOur server was a contrast to the previous experience. He was helpful and eager to get us drinks and take our order. I was curious about Stubb's food, knowing it's reputation and hype for a music venue. Well, the food was unimpressive and their presentation lacked imagination. It wasn't even down home! The sweet potatoes were overly sweet and the serving of brisket was scant, dry and not too tasty. The collard greens were the only save. As we finished off our meager portions we were asked to leave because we were taking too long. We were taking too long because they had just received 300 reservations. It appears that we were standing in the way of their table turn over rate. Once again, it was our fault! Stubb's staff are overly entitled smug Puds serving below average Texas Barbecue!"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Goodness.  Gracious.

We went there with the mindset that we might discover Afghan food is not for us at all. I must that that we were all very pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nWhile they do have many kabobs on the menu to choose from as anyone who has eaten other Middle Eastern cuisines might expect (and which would be a safe choice if you're dining with someone less adventurous), we asked the waitress for her recommendations on the more authentic dishes. I'm very glad we did, as they were all excellent, presented very well, and satisfied our cravings for something more exotic that none of us had tried before. \\n\\nThe four dishes we tried were comprised of lamb or chicken (we may have had one with beef - I can't remember), with flavorful sauces and deliciously exotic seasonings served over white or brown long-grain rice. The use of pumpkin, carrots, yogurt, and raisins was very unique - while I would usually not go out of my way to order dishes with these ingredients, I'm truly glad that we took the waitress's suggestions and tried them. \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, and our waitress even gave our table complementary baklava with a unique noodle ice-cream for desert. The decor was nice and clean - not trendy or upscale, but fitting and authentic; and certainly nice enough for a date night to try something a little adventurous. The waitress said they plan to have outdoor seating soon. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back, and I highly recommend Ariana to anyone looking for a unique new restaurant to explore that's off the beaten path."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Arrived 5 minutes after 11, asked if they were still serving breakfast , got our drinks, told by another employee breakfast was closed and lunch started at 11:30. \\"Can you get us out of here for an 12:00 appointment?\\"  \\"I don't know; you better go across the street\\".

I hate this place because they don't know how to make a proper cocktail or make anything in the kitchen that I couldn't make in my own kitchen while hammered and blinded using only half of the needed ingredients.\\n\\nIf I am dragged here again I will only get whiskey in a glass since I know they will not mess this up."},{"name":"Fazenda Cafe","address":"3710 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"This is my new favorite coffee spot.  The iced coffee is amazing and the scones are like crack - in a good way.  I've had a couple of really good breakfast sandwiches too.   It's so good I've stopped going to Dunks most mornings -  this is monumental.  Trust me."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I'm in love with the corn dogs. Gotta have tater tots too. They are great and crispy.  The family loves everything smothered in chili and cheese.  My daughter gets the chili dog. The chili is a chunkier consistency than Cincinnati chili.  The corn dogs come two at a time.  They're full sized and come with spicy mustard and melted cheese. They taste like they were fresh made from the fair.  \\nThe place is tiny inside and very popular so expect to wait unless you order carry out.  There are tons of different combinations.  Everyone is bound to find a favorite. They even have dessert.  ENJOY!"},{"name":"Super Thai Food","address":"","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Ordered the chicken pad thai at the food truck festival at the Concord Pacific lot Sunday. So sorry about this review but the $10 pad thai wasn't worth it. I couldn't find any chicken on it, and they piled small slices of cabbage underneath the noodles. I've had better pad thais at a lesser price."},{"name":"La Mezcaleria","address":"1622 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Was set on finally trying this place due to all the excellent reviews. Had a meeting run late until 9:45pm, came home, told the girlfriend to hurry up and we rushed over (they close at 11). \\n\\nThe place was packed! We ended up sitting at the bar staring at the chefs making aromatic deliciousness. What a tease considering I hadn't eaten since 1pm. \\n\\nWe ordered far too much food and recruited the girlfriend's brother for help. \\n\\n- the amigos flight of ceviche and guac was good but not amazing. I've had better ceviche so I'll be skipping this dish next time. I'm not saying it wasn't tasty; it just didn't wow me. Props for the octopus one. Haven't had that at a lot of places. \\n\\n- the queso fundido salsa Verde was effing amazing. Just shovel that cheese in my face. Mexican fondue? YES YES YES. Don't be hasty or else you'll burn your effing mouth.\\n\\n- the pork belly appetizer was amazing. Crispy and chewy and and and. \\n\\n- the beef cheek taco is way too oily. I don't think it can be helped because it's greasy everywhere I've had it. \\n\\n- the al pastor was tasty but didn't have as much pineapple sweetness as I'm used to. I'm not asking for candy sweet but just a bit more than what was there. \\n\\n- the poblano pepper taco was amazing. Best I've had in the city. \\n\\n- the banana leaf pork was so aromatic and delicious. I liked it but my girlfriend wasn't a fan.\\n\\n- the horchata was tasty but not as creamy as I like. \\n\\n\\nThe service was fantastic. It was a bit loud but that's like most restaurants nowadays. I really love the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant. Three people working the kitchen for the entire place...that's just crazy amazing and demonstrates their mad skills. Fantastic food and great service."},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"Hubby and  I have never been disappointed with Wild Horse Cafe.  Some of the reviewers have a beef with bar side vs. restaurant side, but I do not know about that. I have only tried the restaurant.  We absolutely love the salmon and the duck.  We have tried the fish and specials and liked them very much.  The service has always been very helpful, friendly and professional.  Tonight, I wanted the waiter to tell me if I wanted the sea bass special or the duck. He said the duck, and so I went with it.  It was incredible.  Then, in this atmosphere of trust, I asked him to just bring me the right glass of wine to go with the duck and he was right on with the pinot noir.  I'm glad I put my fate in the hands of the staff at the Wild Horse Cafe.  Next time I'm shoe shopping I'm going to text them a pic of the shoes and see if they think I should buy them.  This place rocks!  I wish I could go there every night!!"},{"name":"Porter Ale House & Gastropub","address":"3715 S 1st St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Meh food even though it's supposed to be organic and delicious. I think the presentation is focused on more than the taste. I like the clean/new feel to the ambiance, but it's a bit too small. Good beer selection though, and good service.

Great salads,  good burgers, decent tex mex.  I had salmon with mango salsa here recently that rocked.  \\n\\nChristophers is open late, you can always find parking in the porter lot, and yes, it is next to toad so you can catch some free live music nearby too.  There is a huge menu, so always something for everyone and a good place to go when you can't decide what the hell to eat with a group of people.  I've never had a bad experience here.  Plus, they have KICK ASS brunch with really good eggs benedict and their potatoes are so yummy, plus you can get smashed on espresso martinis that are perfectly justifiable as a vehicle for caffiene that just happens to contain lots and lots of booze too.  what's wrong with multi-tasking?"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down one of the best places to eat in Orlando.

I was pleased with the outcome and left feeling full.  The portions are most definitely hearty, so be sure to come here hungry!\\n\\nI absolutely love love LOVE that you get a freshly baked raspberry scone before your breakfast entree comes out.
