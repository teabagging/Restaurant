All 3 of us were overly happy with our food, however my medium burger did have spots of very rare looking meat which I did not eat. The hostess continued to stare at us and it was very obvious she was talking about us. Upon leaving I realized I left my credit card, I had to call them and I was surprised how snarky they were about it. They have great food, but they need a new staff. I do not recommend based on the atmosphere created by their employees.\\n\\nUPDATED to 3 stars: When I called Friday about my credit card they didn't tell me they had limited hours on the weekends. So I never got to retrieve my card before I came home. However, when I called this morning the manager was so nice and apologetic about my experience and said that he addressed my review with his staff. That really impressed me and I am glad the situation was taken seriously and hopefully will improve for future guests."},{"name":"Sa Bai Thai Cuisine","address":"4440 NE 131st Pl","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is a hidden gem.

I got the Eggs Benedict, as did everyone else in my dining group. The hollandaise sauce was especially delicious but the seasonal fruit was a little lacking.\\n\\nUnfortunately the service was a little weird. Downright confusing in fact. Upon presentation of the check, we attempted to split the damage amongst the four of us. The waiter decided to completely ignore our written check splitting instructions and produced individual checks that were completely wrong. After going back and forth with progressively more and more incorrect checks, the waiter charged everyone incorrectly. We eventually figured it out but taking twenty minutes to get the bill right is completely unacceptable."},{"name":"Cuatro's","address":"1004 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have very mixed feelings about Cuatro's.  \\n\\nOn one hand, they have great food; everyone at my table, and there were ten of us, enjoyed their order.  The tuna tacos (think fish tacos with forearm-sized chunks of seared ahi tuna steak instead of the usual tilapia) were outstanding, and the queso was quite tasty.  Several friends ordered burgers and found them to be quite tasty, as well.  The service was prompt and we were checked on regularly, despite being during the popular Florida/OU game - the bar was packed but our waiter was by regularly, and delays were few and far between.\\n\\nAdditionally, they show the Chelsea matches, which is a very positive thing, and they have a menu item named after Jens (it's called the Chelsea Blue - give this shot a shot, it's good).  The TVs are plentiful, and it surely has the largest screen of any bar in town - the viewing is probably good from INSIDE the church that's across the street.  The patio is quite large, bright, and airy, too.  I didn't get a chance to sample any, but they offer sweet potato fries, which endears them to me.\\n\\nDrink specials are fitting for a college bar - $2 PBR (in a can, how hipster!) and $3 Lone Star tall boys.  Though I'll never understand why two virtually identical beers can have such different social implications..\\n\\nThe prices are pretty fair, and parking is decent, too.\\n\\nThen again, their morning breakfast tacos aren't particularly good, by which I mean they were pretty mediocre for Austin, they don't have Smithwick's at all, and they're next to campus (so overpopulated by fratboys and sorostitutes).  Their fried pickles were too greasy and over-breaded.  Aa tip to Cuatro - don't fry slices, fry SPEARS, and your problem will disappear as there's a much better pickle-to-breading-ratio.\\n\\nMorning service was horrendous - it was a fight to get the waitress to acknowledge me at all, and then my breakfast taco came out lukewarm and runny; the cook obviously rushed it to get it out fast, not quite finishing the eggs, and then it sat and got cold while the waitress got around to it.  The road noise is a bit excessive, though I suppose you can't blame Cuatro's for that one.\\n\\nThey are very dog friendly - they keep water bowls on hand for your dog, and they don't mind much if the dogs socialize while their people have a pint.\\n\\n\\nSo the balance, all said and done?  3/5.  Get some Smithwick's (I mean, really, you've got footie but not Smithwick's?), remedy the morning service (just make sure the waitress isn't the same one that worked last night), and drop the prices a bit, and you'll be up to five stars.\\n\\nSmithwick's is a whole star by itself.

The food at Solly's is as much takeout as it is eat-in. Both ways of eating have their advantages, but I prefer eating in.\\n\\nAs well, you should know that this is THE location out of the three to eat in as it is way bigger and more spread out than the other two locations.\\n\\nThe most impressive item you should try is the cinnamon bun with its thin swirls and very sticky cinnamon glaze, but when you order it PLEASE make sure you ask for the warmed up version with the cream cheese icing on top.

Do you like pretty birds? They have them. Fake birds? Yup those too. Paintings of birds? They'll stare down your dinner. Giving the bird? Well only if service is bad. I was most eager to visit this restaurant because of Le Pigeon the bird who stole my heart but mostly I was just tired of reading about its glory from other Yelpers. \\n\\nI'd like to note that the beverage list is extremely well organized not only by type but by continuity of your meal. Start with an aperitif, followed by a few glasses of vino and end it with a digestive of tawny port. Of course the wine list is met by the French theme with 90% featured from France and the remaining from the US. There are enough glass options to satisfy most and the prices are reasonable for this class of restaurant. However if you aren't familiar with French wines you may have a tough time selecting a bottle. In my typical form I brought my own, a Burgundian style Pinot Noir from VX Winery which was greeted by a $20 corkage fee. With our red opening up we selected two white blends to pair with our mussels and green garlic appetizer which was accompanied by lemon fries. The mussels were moist and flavorful with a balance of garlic, onion and herbs. At first the lemon fries sounded kind of pedestrian but really their zest accentuated the seasoning nicely, still we preferred bread to soak up the remaining broth.  The wine that intrigued me was the \\"Edelzwicker\\" which is specially made for them by Chehalem Winery. This blended wine was acidic and tart right up front but was followed by great fruit intensity which paired nicely with the sharpness of the broth. \\n\\nNext came our entrees where I did something I never do, I ordered the chicken. It's as if they were challenging me amongst the more fancy options or maybe it was all the bird remarks affecting my subconscious, because I accepted! First my gf was greeted by a fresh filet of sockeye with grilled peaches and Zinfandel syrup. The fish was cooked med-rare which delivered a tender blow almost dissolving in your mouth. Mixing this delicate bite with a combination of mildly sweet caramelized peach and tart glaze made for a wonderful combination. There I sat as a roasted thigh and leg were presented on a bed of savory julienne chive potatoes with a rich goat cheese vinaigrette coating the perimeter. The flesh had the perfect density against the crisp skin and an incredible flavor. I fought with the idea that the seasoning could be so perfect yet only be salt and pepper. The potatoes were rich but still offered some texture while the vinaigrette tied everything together. Afterwards I sat defeated all it took was a swift slap by a Frenchman's white glove! I guess I should have known better than to question anything on the menu. I now give these chefs my trust, if in their hands and placed on the menu it's for a reason. Throughout the meal our service was A+ and the restaurant was far from empty, with the check our waitress brought us the final treat mini basil infused macaroons that lent a pleasant palate cleansing goodbye. My experience was certainly worthy of 5 stars but that may be a bit of a culinary sin for chicken. \\n\\nCome to Little Bird where they will inject some creative fusion with classic French cooking elevating your dining experience with a refinement all its own and while you will pay well to eat here you will be rewarded with a magnificent meal in return."},{"name":"Lucky Noodle Chinese Restaurant","address":"3377 Kingsway, Suite 3","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"If you like super spicy food, you must try Lucky Noodles!!

ASK if they are sold out of lobster. on our first attempt to eat here, we went in at 7 pm, with an hour wait, by the time we were called for our table only to be told that they were out of lobster. we were going SPECIFICALLY for a lobster roll, so this was like OMG DEVESTATING news. I left heartbroken, but live and learn.... if you are waiting for a table and give your phone number, they can call you if they run out in the meantime to give you a heads up in case you would like to make other plans.\\n2. go as EARLY AS POSSIBLE. don't show up at 8 pm and expect them to still have lobster. this place gets BUSY and things do get sold out, despite what the hostess may tell you - when we made our second attempt at dinner here, we were told \\"that never happens!\\" well guess what, it happened to us! we knew better to play it safe next time and go directly from work for an early dinner.\\ndo this and you will have no problem."},{"name":"Everybody's Pizza","address":"1040 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"A large group of us went to Everybody's last Saturday night.

He also loves that it's clean and doesn't have that \\"Austin is weird, therefore we must all look grungy\\" look to it.\\n\\nThis is a place that doesn't do too much...except focus on being good.  The Eggs Benedict are some of the best in town and we all love their salads, French toast and omelets.  The service is attentive and very, very friendly.

The soup comes with a side of mint leaves, soybean sprouts, and a lime, which are all pretty standard when ordering pho.

Then I got the toppings I wanted, barbacoa, black beans, tomatillo salsa, cheese, guacamole and cilantro. The meat had good flavor but was greasy and full of chunks of fat, way too wet. The tomatillo salsa was really good, black beans tasted fine but so much liquid like the meat, that they both flooded the rice, which I really hadn't wanted and didn't eat anyway.

With the exception of our waitress, the girls weren't that busty or good looking.

The boobs were regular sized and totally achievable with the help from a sock or two, and the girls were ordinary.

You'd understand if you ever saw me.\\n\\nOddly enough, we didn't attend their traditional Thanksgiving dinner. We opted for the regular dinner menu.

It was fun to see what everyone had in those lockers though. \\n\\nOur server was great. He was professional and friendly. Our group ordered several different dishes to try. I'll give you a quick rundown. Duck was good, lamb was better. The meat was well cooked and flavored. I ordered a rib eye topped with dungeness crab and bearnaise sauce. The bernaise was a little salty for me, but the crab was delicious. Good portions, texture, and flavor.\\n\\nIt was crowded that night too, but it still felt intimate because of the dim lighting.

We had made a reservation for 6 including the 2 small kids. The hostess was incredibly rude and not at all accommodating.  The main issue was we were seated at a booth and the baby (in the car seat) would not fit in the booth seat and the table did not move to accommodate the large seat. The hostess was snarky and basically said it was our fault for not letting them know beforehand that we were bringing a baby - even after I said we'd been there dozens of times with the baby and NEVER had a problem before this. She told us to put the baby up on the table and didn't offer us any alternatives, such as a different place to sit. At this point the kids were hungry, as were my in-laws so we decided to stay rather than trying to find someplace else on Father's Day. However her horrible attitude ruined my entire Father's Day. To make matters worse, the manager was \\"too busy in the kitchen\\" so we never spoke to him/her.

That's not a problem, that tells me that the contents of this restaurant are promising. But each time I got easily distracted by the sights and sounds of the northend and I was never able to fulfill my wait. This time was different. I went in at 4 and they said 45 minutes. DEAL! So I waited and about 25 minutes later I got the call. SCORE! And so it begins: We did not order the lobster roll (like everyone else in the restaurant) We really wanted to explore the other items on the menu. Side note: in my professional opinion we are outside of optimal lobster season so I typically wont order lobster based dishes this time of year. Carry on. So, we order some apps, a dozen oysters, and some entrees. As we were waiting I was trying to engage our bartender/waiter explaining how excited we were and how long we've tried to get in ect; he couldn't care less. Okay, maybe hes busy, understandable. I tried again. Nothing. Ok well we'll just wait awkwardly for our food. The oyster came and were great, very fresh with typical fixing, nothing elevated or out of the ordinary. Next the apps and entrees came at the same time, maybe because we said we were sharing everything. Then there was a 15 minute lull. Then our chowder came. I thought, oh that's kind of interesting that it came out last but whatever, it looks good! It wasn't. Actually it was terrible. Consistency of water, potatoes were raw, clams were overcooked by about 3 days and had more sand and grit that I have ever tasted. there was no flavor. I am not joking. Picture heating water up and adding a splash of milk and that's what it tasted like. So needless to say, I left disappointed. After gallivanting around Boston, I went home and did some investigating. How can this place have 4.5 stars I exclaimed!?!?!? Here is what I found: All of the 5 star reviews are all based on this \\"magical\\" lobster roll. Tourists and locals alike had a life altering lobster roll. That's cool! But as I looked deeper at the 1 2 and 3 star reviews, they all sounded like what I experienced. Bartender couldn't care less. Food is just ok. Chowder was inedible. Ect. Then there were the 4 star reviews. People who had a similar experience as I did but had a friendly waiter and the lobster roll so it up their review a star. Well here's my opinion, I wont be back, not even to try this godly lobster roll. This place is more of a tourist trap than a Boston institution. Do not get it twisted.

The food menu itself is a little small, but the ingredients were good quality and the variety is good considering the size of the menu (they even have a tofu steak that was quite delicious!).

The bartenders are attentive and crafty. I especially recommend going on a Wednesday night.

I caught, in the corner of my eye, the glowing word \\"Yakitori\\" in the shopping complex across the street.  I drove by to investigate, and scrutinized the humble storefront.\\n\\nOnce I got home, I went on Yelp and searched the name. I'm very picky about my Japanese food, as most Japanese folks are.  There are way too many Korean-owned impostor restaurants that serve spoons with the miso soup in Atlanta for me to just wander into a Japanese restaurant without doing sufficient research. Reviews were good! I saw two things I needed to try: Tonkotsu ramen noodles, and the yakitori (duh).\\n\\nI dragged my brother there for dinner that night. I ordered the Tonkotsu and a few yakitoris, as suggested. The Tonkotsu ramen noodles came out so fast! This is where I am going to get serious.  I am obsessed with tonkotsu ramen noodles. It's my favorite thing, ever! Every summer when I go to Yokohama to visit family, I make my aunt drive me to the nearest Tonkotsu ramen noodle spot and I bury my face in what would be my last meal on earth. The tonkotsu shops always had a distinct, putrid smell that I have come to associate with the broth, which is made from boiling bits of pork fat and bone for hours upon hours, until the marrow becomes one with the broth and only the most sturdy part of the bones are left to be discarded.  Yakitori Jinbei had a pleasant, lemony aroma and did not smell like rotting meat, so I was a bit skeptical about the authenticity of the ramen noodles that I hold so close to my heart. However, after the first bite into the slightly chewy noodles followed by the salty, buttery burst of broth, I knew I had found it--AUTHENTIC tonkotsu noodles in Atlanta! So for those of you that don't know: Bring your own boiled egg if you want it in this tonkotsu--this isn't your 39 cent packaged ramen that needs to be spruced up with a little ball of protein. And the noodles are supposed to be that chewy. I'm telling you, many may find the $13 price high, but I would pay that in a heartbeat for that stuff.\\n\\nAnyways, I'm writing this review while waiting for them to re-open for dinner. It's making me really hungry and I have to stop myself before I drive myself crazy!  However, if you have a penchant for \\"authentic\\" Japanese food (aka, you don't eat miso soup with a spoon) I strongly suggest you make the hike out here to Yakitori Jinbei, my new favorite restaurant! \\n\\nOh, and by the way, it doesn't say anywhere on the website or on Yelp but THEY ARE CLOSED ON MONDAYS.

The pork belly fell apart when the fork even looked at it, and it had a perfect crispy skin. The salad was bright and tasty and very well balanced. My husband ordered the NY Strip and I got the crepe. He said his steak was perfectly seasoned, but he wished the chili sauce had a little more heat and the steak was a little more marbled than he's used to with that cut. My crepe was light and delicious, especially with the vinaigrette. We had no intention of ordering dessert, until the server told us the ice cream was coconut with lemongrass and the sorbet was kiwi.

Crust thickness is standard, and the default cheese is mozzarella but you can request vegan cheese for a little extra money. Service was friendly when we called in for pick-up, and they even offered plates to-go.

See, Garrido's used to be one of my favorite spots downtown.  After last night, we probably won't be going back.\\n\\nThe food, it was good.  Out waiter was Also good.  But everything else was just a bit off.\\n\\nI will take some of the blame in this.  It was Saturday evening and we did not have a reservation, a point that the hostess made sure to inform us of in her first breath.  But we were there at 5:30 and the place was rather empty.\\n\\nThe hostess did allow that we could get a table, but only if we sat outside.  Um.  If she would have asked, that is what we wanted anyway.\\n\\nSo she took us outside to the almost empty patio, where only 2 tables were seated.  She leads us to a table that is obviously extremely wobbly.  I asked about a table next to it and was told that it was reserved ...at 6:30.  I had to explain that we only wanted to eat a quick dinner.  Thankfully there was a nice waitress nearby that agreed we could eat dinner, so the unhappy hostess seated us.  \\n\\nAs you can imagine, this was not the best set-up for what was supposed to be a fun meal out.  We felt rather leper-ish at this point.  We almost left.  But we didn't, so let me note just a few more things.\\n\\nNow, as I said, the food and out waiter were really good, but there were some odd minutes while we waited for the waiter to make his way out.  Like when 3 of waitstaff opened the door and just stared at us, I presume discussing who had our table.  \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes after we were seated, we finally had water and chips.  In that time another couple was attempt-seated at the wobbly table and they did leave.\\n\\nMy next complaint, again I will take some responsibility for.  But what I wanted last night were tacos.  I am not a big eater, and miss the old menu where I could order the number of tacos that I actually wanted(1 or 2). The current taco plates come with 3, and I was too full for anything else.  That and 3 tacos all the same flavor, boring!\\n\\nFinally, and I write this for the benefit of our hostess and her unwelcoming attitude toward us.  When we left at 6:30, we had witnessed a restaurant that did not fill up during our time there.  There were still empty tables inside and outside.  And there was no line of patrons anywhere to be seen.  Yes, you probably were full at 7:00, but that is not an excuse for being rude at 5:30.  I tried my best to smile at you when we left, I can't say I blame you for not even making eye contact."},{"name":"Teji's Indian Restaurant and Grocery","address":"2100B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I like it. it's close to campus. has a huge variety of dishes. tastes authentic and spicy to me, definitely not watered down. service is solid for a place on a drag. prices are also reasonable. teji's a closer, more authentic, clay pit. if only it had a lunch buffet...."},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"304 Western Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"3","text":"I love this place.

My family wanted to try the new place, so we called ahead to reserve a table for 9 people. The atmosphere is almost jungle-like. The tables have a picture of a plant/leaves/thing going on. The plates and teapots look like they are from Ikea (not a bad thing)! Anyway, we first order our drinks and appetizers. When the appetizers come, I asked the waitress if our drinks were on their way. She replied, \\"it will take a long time. there is only one person working on drinks.\\" I said, \\"a long time?\\" She said yes. Hmm... granted English is probably not her first language, maybe there was a better way to say that my milk tea with boba was going to take awhile. Anyway, we got Roti and Chicken Satay skewers. The roti was good. Some crunchy and some soft parts, but it was a tiny portion!! :(  We ordered two, but everyone was only able to have one or two small pieces. The little bowl of curry was glazed with a layer of oil. After mixing it, it was fine, but watery. I guess this place gets *one star* for the chicken satay. Maybe I was hungry, but it was so dang good! Marinated well. My brother who doesn't like chicken even said it was good. It also came with good chunky curry dipping sauce. Overall, the food was ok. I prefer Penang any day, but we wanted to try this new restaurant. The mango shrimp was fine with good sized shrimp, but the mango was sour!! I then noticed the mango peel was green = not ripe! Please do NOT order the mango tofu -- the worst dish ever with strips, yes i said strips of fried tofu. I have never had strips of tofu before, but I don't ever want them again. Well, unless you like only the tofu skin then maybe you will love this dish. But I personally like a little bit of both. There was nothing inside the tofu skin. And again the mango was sour :( . The pork and short rib dishes were true to name. Coffee flavored short ribs did taste like coffee marinated meat. The fried rice was ok. Sad story, the pineapple fried rice does NOT come with a fresh cut pineapple (unlike Penang). The hainanese chicken was super dry! Note that this chicken is supposed to be one of their well known dishes. And the sauce it came with was wayy too spicy. \\n\\nI wish this place was better, so it can be an alternative to Penang.

Art museums have a bad habit of blending). Sadly, the painting is lacking without the room decor that it had in the larger exhibit. \\n\\nTwo of the present exhibitions are absolutely spectacular. The Peter Zimmerman one is unbelievably gorgeous and a very immersive experience. It is worth a look.\\nThe other exhibition is one that I think they should always have but rotate the things in it. Its an exhibition of the OSU archives. There's some seriously cool stuff there. Its like walking into the ancient cellar of OSU but everything is named and explained. It is absolutely worth the price. Also.... its free for students. \\n\\nThe store there has actually seriously upped its quality in weird things. I continually find myself stopping in there for birthday presents and the like. \\n\\nThe Renaissance room is my absolute favorite. Its gorgeous and really conveys the right feeling. I sometimes just go and sit in there for hours. My favorite painting is Iris of the Rainbows. (To your left if you're standing at the north door.) \\n\\nI really wish that they would have people who would pass on really cool things about the artists. (Strange segue, but I was thinking about the myth behind the painting). Most people don't care about the details, but I find myself giving unofficial tours to the people I know who don't enjoy old art, and teaching them how to look at it so that they see what I see. There are so many amazing tales and stories about these places. Maybe educate the guards so they can toss in some neat info once in a while. Tell the people about where we actually FOUND all of Goya's most famous paintings, or explain the trouble Egon Schiele used to get himself in. \\n\\nThat might have been a bit of a rant, I admit that. I find it a bit embarrassing that our museum isn't managing to cater to the people of its city. \\n\\nFor the average citizen, it is worth a visit once in a while to see the traveling exhibits."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Probably my favorite donut shop.

We popped by on a late afternoon for a quick bite and a drink.  \\n\\nAs usual, we entered and headed to the bar, which was empty apart for a couple of gentleman sitting near the front door at the bar.  They were pretty hard to not miss since one of the dudes, was absolutely plastered.  He was actually being quite loud and even signing to the cute bartender in a slurred Scottish brogue.  I am happy they had a long bar, since we were able to get to the other end, to get away from him and his companion.  Otherwise, we would of turned around and headed back out the door.  Even then, they kept on eye balling us, as to wanting to engage us in conversation, but the distance between us served as a decent barrier.  Eventually, the bar keep recommended they go see her friend down at Baker Street Pub and we could enjoy the ambiance.  To the bar keeps credit, I believe she had inherited this patron from the shift change.\\n\\nWe ordered our drinks and a calamari appetizer.  The calamari was breaded with a parmesan batter and was fairly pedestrian.  Nothing super special, a little salty due to the parmesan, definitely an edible snack to accompany a few cold brews.

The employees were all pretty friendly folk and a special nod to the hostess that day who made sure to give a big smile and welcome once entering and again upon our departure.  Towards the end of our visit, the bar started to fill up, with a high ratio of men to women in the bar area.

My boyfriend and I wanted to order a pizza to go and decided to order a few drinks knowing that pizzas usually take some time to make.  I should have turned away when we approached the bar and had to wait for the waitresses to acknowledge us because they were too busy bickering about the rudeness of their clientele (so loudly and obviously that their accusations were almost laughable when that type of behavior in the service industry is about as rude as it gets).  I should have known that I was about to encounter a bitter power-tripping waitress and her spineless minion, both completely incapable basic service skills such as friendliness (is a smile so difficult?), tactfulness (your other customers don't want to hear about how much you despise table #20), and promptness (we were only able to order our pizza well after our first round of drinks were finished which, I'm pretty sure, would have been ignored if we hadn't brought it to her attention).\\n\\nI ordered a glass of house wine from the waitress, not seeing a wine menu anywhere near.  I've worked as a server for nearly a decade at a variety of establishments, ranging from higher end sports bar/restaurants to pizza and pasta italian/american restaurants similar to this one.  That being said, \\"house wine\\", in restaurant speak, SHOULD translate to the lowest priced wine on the menu.  It's a way to order a glass of wine, on a budget, while maintaining some class.  However, without my consent or even any knowledge about the type of wine I was being poured, I received two itty-bitty glasses of their MOST expensive wine on the menu.  Don't get me wrong, I am more than willing to pay for delicious higher-end wine but when I order a glass of \\"house\\" I'm not looking for anything special.  Once again, BASIC service skills.  After receiving the bill and bringing this to the servers attention, she looked at me and said \\"I'm sorry?\\", with a whip of sarcasm.  Then  were ignored, once again.  Ugh.  Wow.  I tried to be reasonable when expressing this concern but my guess is that these ladies may inspire whatever flavor of attitude they are experiencing from their clientele.\\n\\nAs for the pizza... it was decent... aside from the missing topping the cook neglected to include.  \\n\\nManagement issues?

I met a friend here last night for a light business meeting over some chow, and it worked great for that purpose.  I started off by getting a margarita in the bar.  Margaritas in Mexican restaurants are kind of like Pad Thai in a Thai restaurant...  if they make this item well, the rest of the place is probably pretty good too.\\n\\nMy margarita was pleasing without being mind-blowing, which pretty much summed up the place as a whole.  For dinner I got the combo platter of enchilada and chile relleno, both cheese-only because I can never get too much gooey yummy cheese in my life.  The two-item platter is served with beans, rice, chips, and salsa, which is quite a lot of food for the $9.99 they charged.  My relleno was a little bland and oddly seemed to need a little bit of salt (really unusual in a Mexican restaurant), but the enchilada had a great sauce and hit the spot.  The chips and salsa were also totally fine - they were not the freshly-prepared and served hot style that I love so much, but the chips were salted well (I hate unsalted tortilla chips) and the salsa had a good blend of onions and cilantro so that it wasn't just a cup of stewed tomatoes.  Everything tasted great.  \\n\\nBeing a taqueria, there is no table service - you order everything up at the counter and carry it back to your table - but if you don't need waiter service then this place will work for you.  They also have takeout food in case you want to bring home a flan for dessert after stuffing your belly with tortillas and cheese.\\n\\nIt was a quiet night when I was there so I can't speak to the effectiveness of the child's play area, which was unused when I was there, but the atmosphere of the restaurant is airy and open, and I can imagine that the tables outside would be a great place to spend a lazy summer evening.

I went with the former, bacon and blue cheese, and our over the top server answered my questions with prescient knowledge.  \\"And the blue cheese are the big crumbles, not that sickly salad dressing stuff.\\"\\n\\nSold.\\n\\nService was prompt and the burger at definite curb appeal.  Food is served in a basket, and most orders are accompanied by fries.  I liked the burger, it's hand formed and pre-seasoned and suits my palate.\\n\\nThe fries weren't spectacular but there was nothing wrong with them, either.  Mrs. BDB went with a veggie sandwich and a traditional soda, strawberry, which I had a sample of, and enjoyed that very much.\\n\\nWhile I have rarely contemplated a shopping mall as a dinner destination, perhaps I should more often.

Usually (from prior experience) it takes a really long time for your food to come out. \\nOverall, the food was good (3/5). We presume that eating at the restaurant would have made the food taste better than sitting in my tiny studio. \\n\\nWe ordered: \\n\\n+ BAKED HADDOCK: This is the dish that I ordered for myself and I was really glad that I did. The haddock was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The rice pilaf was also cooked perfectly -- it was moist, yet had the chewy consistency that I enjoy. The asparagus was also well seasoned, but was a bit too greasy or oily... BUT if I am ever back here again, I will definetly opt for this dish over the other options. (4.5/5) \\n\\n+ SHRIMP SCAMPI: They provide lots of shrimp, which was lovely. HOWEVER, the spaghetti in this dish and the other spaghetti dish ... was so UNDERCOOKED. I mean my friends sounded like they were chewing on gum. The spaghetti was also really thick in circumference... well i guess that would make since, as it was not angel hair pasta. But while the shrimp was delicious and the entire dish was well balanced and seasoned, the pasta was way undercooked (3/5) \\n\\n- SPAGHETTI & CLAMS: So I have really mixed feelings about this dish because when you eat clams you have to get it out of the shell... this can cause some of the hard pieces of the shell to get mixed in with the pasta and unfortunately when you take a fork-full of pasta you will run into times where you will hear a hard crunch (aka shell piece)... This makes it not so pleasant to eat and caused us to lose our appetite. However because the clams are cooked in with the pasta, it is a really flavorful & \\"seafood-y\\" tasting dish. But again the pasta was undercooked. (2/5) \\n\\n\\nServers are super sweet even with take-out orders!

And boy, what a dream it was. Spending a classy evening admiring the regal decor, sipping on expertly crafted drinks and snacking on scrumptious small plates, all in the company of the wonderful Eunice E... now that's how you spend a Saturday night!\\n\\nLet's rewind a bit. Eunice and I showed up at about 7 on a rainy, windy Saturday evening. We didn't have reservations, but we were hoping to grab a couple seats at the bar. When we initially spoke to the hostess, we were told it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait. We were bummed, but decided to put our names down and stick around. As luck would have it, another hostess came over and told us that a table was just paying and finishing up and that it should only be a few more minutes. Let the dream begin!\\n\\nA short while later, we were seated. After browsing through the drink menu, we opted for martinis. Prices were steep - $22 - but for that price tag, you get a whole lot of drink! The menu lists them as \\"served extra large.\\" You definitely get at least 2 drinks' worth out of them. I'm not the biggest martini fan, but they were definitely the best I've ever had. We both shamelessly asked for more olives to go with them!\\n\\nOn to the food! All of the small plates sounded absolutely wonderful, so we decided to order a couple of them, along with the flatbread. The flatbread was quite simple, nothing fancy, but very flavorful nevertheless. For small plates, we started with the fried green tomatoes, which seems like an odd choice but actually turned out to be a spectacular one. We also went with the \\"lobster one handers\\" - mini lobster rolls on steamed Chinese buns. They were absolutely divine. Two small plates, one flatbread - the perfect amount of food.\\n\\nAnd so the dream ended. The food and drinks were completely five-star worthy, but the service left a little to be desired. Our server never came over to check on us once we got our food, and he was nowhere to be found for the majority of the time we were there.

It is, quite frankly, the best I've ever had, bar none. And believe me, I've tried quite a bit. I love good ice cream. Jake's is made by hand in small batches, and while it's much harder than soft serve, it's still softer than most. It actually tastes like what you might get out of a real, honest-to-God, old-fashioned churn at home, if you had the genius to create such amazing recipes as Chocolate Slap Yo Mama and Brown Sugah Vanilla.\\n\\nThe flavors are amazing and constantly changing. My favorite, the astonishingly delicious Brown Sugah Vanilla, is usually available, although some of the other varieties of vanilla, such Yo Daddy's Vanilla, Honey Vanilla, and Vanilla Malt, are a little more rare. Not to worry, though, they are all terrific. I am especially fond of cinnamon ice cream ... and have more than once visited Jake's and found two different cinnamons available at the same time. In all, I've found five different cinnamons at one time or another, including Cinnamon Chocolate, Cinnamon Roll (with real pieces of yummy cinnamon rolls), Cinnamon Kenya AA (cinnamon with coffee!), Cinnamon Apple Piescream, and just plain Cinnamon. I'm not sure I could pick a favorite. Although in the interest of journalistic investigation, I intend to keep trying.\\n\\nSpeaking of coffee, there are at least six varieties of coffee ice cream, and nine chocolates--from the simple but terrific Just Plain Chocolate to the exotic (and rather surprising) Mexican Hot Chocolate, with adds a bite of hot pepper. Don't laugh. It's unusual, sure, but amazing. The point is, there is always something new to try, although it's hard to say no to old favorites, since you never know if they'll be there next time. I haven't seen the Root Beer Float variety in ages.\\n\\nNot to worry, though. Whatever happens to be there ... it'll be wonderful. The problem, alas, is making a choice. Thankfully, American genius has concocted the two scoop/two flavor cup or cone. Give Jake's a try. I challenge you to find better ice cream.\\n\\nWhen I first discovered Jake's, they were located in a funky old house on Church Street in Decatur, Georgia, just a block or two from the Square. They later moved to a space on Clairmont, which was fine but just never quite the same. Now, they've moved to the Irwin Street Market, which I think is my favorite space of all. Jake's shares the space with a breakfast nook and lunch counter, a coffee shop and bakery, a few shelves of homemade pasta sauces, and a market.\\n\\nAside from Jake's, of course, I've only tried the bakery. I recommend it highly. It's run by the baker himself and his wife, and their obvious pride in their cannoli is well-justified. The coffee has always been hot, fresh, and well-brewed. The other treats look almost too inviting.\\n\\nThe space itself includes lots of comfy chairs and tables, perfect for lingering over breakfast, a coffee, or an ice cream with friends, a laptop, or a good book. It's deliciously unpretentious, relaxed, and welcoming--spacious and wonderfully quiet, perfect for reading, working, or conversation. It's a cozy, welcoming space--one of my very favorite urban hangouts in a city that is rich with them. I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast. I'm planning to do some writing there this week. I hope to see you there.\\n\\nOne complaint ... Jake's doesn't (yet) have hot fudge. Granted, their vanillas are all so good that they don't really need it, but somehow, it seems like a must. But don't worry. Rumor suggests that homemade hot fudge is in the works. I'm looking forward.\\n\\nUPDATE: the hot fudge may be coming sooner rather than later. Jake himself has informed me that testing of various recipes begins this week.

I mentioned to her that my booski had wanted to try this place the last time we ventured down to the Battery but hadn't opened yet.  Keep in mind - we'd just eaten at The Yard House - so we weren't looking for real sustenance - she said she wanted to 'check it out' and possibly get something sweet.  Based on the VERY OPEN floor plan - as soon as we entered - she immediately spied the gelato counter and tried to make a beeline towards it.  I literally had to grab her elbow and try to keep her from running because I was trying to head towards the wood pizza oven.  Lol. \\n\\nUnfortunately - the gentleman working the gelato counter refused to allow her samples.  Said they don't do samples.  EVER.  Was pretty condescending and rude in his delivery.  \\n\\nSidebar.  The pizza looked great - and the restaurant smelled good but based on his less than welcoming attitude - I'll never go back.  And to be clear - my lunch buddy didn't just want to sample all sorts of flavors.  She had literally never had gelato at all (me either - for that matter - but I wasn't in the mood for anything cold at that point - so I really am fired up on her behalf more than anything.)  SO - I get it - we're country.  We're rubes.  How could we be over 30 and never had tried gelato??!!!  Cuz we're country and aren't used to the finer things in life like gelato.  Side eye.  \\n\\nBut would you rather us let you serve us a cup of something we've literally NEVER tried only to have us take a spoonful - before paying - because they hand you cup before you pay - then say, \\"Blech! This is awful.  I don't want this!\\"  \\n\\nNo lines.  Not busy at all - it was around 4pm on Monday so it can't be one of those things where they didn't provide a sample because the line was too long.  \\n\\nDon't be that restaurant that would rather be a bunch of snooty buttholes - than be friendly and make a lifelong customer.  Especially when thanks to the open air format today - there were flies crawling all over your gelato / ice cream cones.

Let's use Cheddars for instance,  highly doubt they have from scratch potato skins and freshly made tortilla chips. Lets look at opposite side of this \\"Scratch Kitchen\\" spectrum and none other than North Quarter is on the end. i started with their beet salad which was delicious. the tanginess from the vinegar was offset nicely with the ripened multicolored beets and muttled fruit (wish i remember the exact term but basically what it was). For the entree i ordered their Tavern burger with egg and bacon added. Wow was this good. I asked for some  siracha to add and they didnt have any. They said they do have a hot sauce available which they brought out. This was their own hot sauce they made from scratch. It was AMAZING. i was pretty damn impressed. I asked for ketchup for my fresh cut fries and was told it would be right out. The ketchup they brought was in an unmarked clear bottle. the consistency was off but i used it anyways. HOLY CRAP their ketchup is from SCRATCH!!! not only is it from scratch but the tomatoes they used were ripened to perfection. Kudos to you guys for really stepping up the game in the condiment world. Its been often overlooked because of the cost effectiveness but if anyone dares to say they are scratch i will use you guys as exhibit A. This is the brother company of the restaurant next door.

It seems they have gotten two new girl employees because their previous ones have been very kind to me. I received the WORST customer service ever when I went in to buy a sandwich. I eat at the soup peddler almost every day for lunch since I live in the neighborhood. I usually get the soup because I am lactose intolerant but decided I wanted to try something new on the menu. I politely asked if I could get a sandwich with no cheese on it. (since there are no dairy free options). Both employees seemed annoyed and told me no because they are pre-made. I asked if I could personally hand pick the cheese off before they grilled it so its not melted and would be easier for me to take off.  The dark haired girl with thick eye liner rolls her eyes and asks the other girl working if this is allowed. Her friend respond in a snarky way and says \\"we don't want to waste food\\". \\n\\nThis was so incredibly rude and I feel talked down to and discriminated against for being allergic to cheese. Even if there was no possible way they could have allowed it, they should have been kind and polite and I would have understood. To not waste food?! that is a dumb excuse especially because I can do whatever I want with something that I paid for. FYI Jo's takes the cheese off of their pre made sanwhiches for me and its not a big ordeal like it is here. If only your employees could empathize with customer who have serious food allergies... \\n\\nAnyway, they wouldn't give me the sandwich and I probably won't spend another penny here ever again. If you are ever considering eating here, please think of your good friends who have to suffer 3 days in the bathroom if they accidentally eat some chees\\n\\n(P.s. I went to Thundercloud instead. No judgment from them and they were happy to welcome me.)\\n\\nUPDATE:: The director of operations emailed me regarding the situation and basically explained that I am in the wrong and that if I can't eat cheese then I just shouldn't go there.

Easily fixed by taking the teabag out, or dropping it in the cup after steeping a little, but this was annoying to me. I also had to use a key for the bathroom, similar to Houndstooth coffee. Which, I also find a little annoying. I grew up near Detroit and this was common there, but I was kinda surprised to have to do that here. There are outlets near 1 side of the place which would make this a good spot to plug in and chill out/study/work. The bakery items available at the time left a little more to be desired. When asked if they had any gluten free options, the gentleman at the counter didn't know the answer (so I'm assuming no) but he did mention some were vegan.

Everyone at the table who ordered differently seamed to enjoy those food. \\n\\nWhy 3 stars? \\nFirst, their smoked salmon and bagel plate is overpriced in my opinion. There wasn't enough salmon to cover both sides of the bagel - really? $10.95 and I couldn't even cover the bagel. If it had come with a side, maybe I would have felt differently but other than the bagel with minimal salmon the rest of the plate was toppings (red onion, capers, tomato and spring lettuce). \\n\\nSecond, the service wasn't that great. I ordered hot tea, asked which flavor I wanted and given a different one. (To be fair, I didn't say anything because I like most teas). We ordered a side of cream cheese and it took over 5 minutes to get it. The server did check after a bit and went back to the kitchen to get it but it was annoying to have to ask again. She wasn't very attentive - coffee ran out several times for awhile and her demeanor seemed like she was bored and \\"over it.\\"\\n\\nAt the end someone else came by and started pouring coffee and was a much cheerier person.

The ambiance was romantic (read: very dark) but masculine- just what I wanted to celebrate my man's birthday. However, when we arrived for our reservation and asked for a window seat, the hostess said it would be 30 minutes. We weren't starving, so we agreed to wait in the lounge and get a drink. This is where the night started to falter, in my opinion. We waited for at least 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us. Longer to get our drinks (Ginger Lemon Drop and a Mojito). Granted, the place was slammed on a Friday night, but still. At these prices, I expect phenomenal service and I don't expect to wait very long for anything. To their credit, the waitress brought my man's drink with a birthday candle stuck in his lime wedge, so that was a thoughtful touch. Waiting 45 minutes for our table sucked, because the sun set two minutes after we were seated. So much for waiting for the view!\\n\\nOur table was sprinkled with birthday themed confetti-- also a special touch I appreciated. However, our server had no personality, and barely spoke to us despite wearing a lot of personality on his face by way of a fab handlebar mustache. Worse yet, he barely came around. Our entire meal took two hours from the time we were finally seated! Crazy! \\n\\nFood: the free bread & butter were a delicious lifesaver. Waiter seemed surprised we didn't want a refill- guess he knew the food was going to take forever to be prepared and served. We ordered the crab and avocado roll as a starter. This was $12 and 8 small pcs. Not sure it was worth it, despite having a nice spicy (but not too spicy) flavor. I think I'll save sushi for sushi restaurants. My man ordered the Wagyu sirloin (rare) and loved it. I tried his green beans and they were spiced perfectly! Mashed potatoes that came with both our meals were good though not the thick, hearty kind your family makes at Thanksgiving. These were thin in texture- probably from all the butter they added! I ordered the goat cheese and prosciutto stuffed chicken. This is a misnomer because the prosciutto is actually wrapped around the chicken. I did not care for this and would not order it again. It came with a disgusting mystery side of greens that was not listed on the menu (shredded collards?) and if I knew it came with greens, I would have asked for green beans instead. It would have been the first time the green veggie on my plate was the better than the protein or starch! Instead, I thought it was all rather gross. I ended up asking for a literal doggie bag and fed my leftovers to my dogs -- who LOVED it -- when I got home. \\n\\nNow, here's where I really got vexed. The waiter brought out the dessert menu while we were still eating dinner, and said, \\"I'll give you a head start to pick out dessert.\\" In my mind, a place this expensive gives a free birthday dessert. We selected the chocolate sour cream donut holes ($9) and it arrived with a lit birthday candle. However, there is was, listed on our bill! I felt that was in bad taste. There were a couple other things that weren't perfect with the service that I won't go into detail here, and that's why I docked a star. Another star docked for my mediocre and inaccurately plated $29 dish, the insanely long wait times for everything, and charging for a birthday dessert without warning us it wasn't free. This is probably a 2.5 star rating, rounded up. \\n\\nWe'll come back someday for happy hour, but probably never again for dinner.

Bread was nothing to write home about, but it's really just there as a vehicle for the sauce, so it did the job. The veggie risotto was also amazing - well-cooked veggies plus cheesy.

I was a huge fan of Chef Chico when he worked at a restaurant in Winter Park and quickly noticed how the menu changed once he left.  Then he opened Bem Bom and now serves fresh, delicious Portuguese food (even better than all the Portuguese restaurants in NJ - sorry!).  The chorico tacos are my absolute favorite and pair well with the bomb fries.  If this is too spicy for your liking, try the mango painted tacos or the piri piri chicken sandwich. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. One tip: since Bem Bom is a popular food truck & everything is made fresh, please note that it can take quite some time for your food to be ready."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Outstanding bloody mary's.

The prices are more than fair and the fish was so fresh and well made. All the rolls we had were well prepared and were very enjoyable. The rainbow roll was my favourite , you could really taste all the fresh ingredients and it melted in our mouths. The spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were also delicious , as was the crab and eel roll. They also offer some great happy hour specials on beer and oysters (1.50$ each)- The beer was great and hit the spot alongside the fresh , meaty oysters. The person I was with had these as their first ever oyster experience and they enjoyed it , they were so fresh. The food was great and the location was big , clean and comfortable.

Not sure where they have the room to do such elaborate preparations in the restaurant's tiny space (kitchen elves?), but bonus points for not buying the bread from Hi-Rise.\\n\\nOne of the fun things about Bondir, as mentioned in other reviews, is the opportunity to order half portions of almost anything, which is a perfect excuse to sample as many of their inventive entrees as you can afford. \\n\\nWe started with a spiced beet salad with pumpkin seeds, which had the most delightful sauce made of pistachios, buttermilk, and grapeseed oil.

The atmosphere is casual and not stuffy but doesn't feel exactly like casual dining, either. \\nHERE IS HOW YOU GET IN: they don't take reservations nor do they add your name to the list over the phone, so at some point you will need to arrive in person. Do not expect less than a 2 hour wait, especially on the weekends. We attempted getting in yesterday, only to be met with the announcement that they were sold out for the remainder of the night. Rather than let that really deter us, we learned our lesson and showed up today at 3:30 (after eating a late lunch) to add our name. At that point, the wait was 3 1/2 hours, which most people scoffed at but was perfect for us (and what we expected). They called about 10 minutes before 7:00 to let us know we had 10 minutes to get there. Because we purposefully went back to the North End by 6:30, that was doable. \\n\\nOk onto the food. We ordered:\\n2 clam chowders (made to order)\\n1 order of mussels\\nA hot, buttered lobster roll with a side salad\\nThe seared scallops\\n\\nThe prices are high but we found them reasonably given the quality of food and very generous portions, and our bill totaled around $120 with tax and tip (we do not drink alcohol). \\nI feel very mixed about the clam chowder. The flavor is incredible, although the sheer number of onion is kind of overwhelming. It doesn't taste overtly oniony, but every spoonful will definitely have several pieces. There are good sized chunks of potato and whole clams, which is a bonus. If you love creamy, thick clam chowder, however, hard pass on this one. It's very, very thin. I liked how it tasted but didn't love the texture, and my husband felt the same. \\nThe mussels are an absolute must - at nearly every restaurant we dine at and order mussels from serves theirs in ye olde basic white wine garlic butter sauce with onion and chopped parsley. Theirs is served with a calabrese sauce, basil, and thinly sliced roasted garlic. It. is. amazing. The portion size is huge as well. The mussels were almost creamy in texture and cooked to perfection, and there was some nice back end heat in the sauce. \\nOur entrees were also very good. My hot, buttered lobster roll had probably about half a stick of butter melted on it, making for an unctuous, rich experience, although by the end I was having a hard time finishing it (so much richness, so much of one thing). I'd recommend getting this and sharing it with someone because finishing it alone is hard. The brioche bun was grilled but still soft. Get the fries, however, because the salad is not good. The lemon vinaigrette is SO lemony that it's not very palatable. \\nThe scallops were melt in your mouth, the duck confit was tender and flavorful without overpowering the scallops, and the Brussels sprouts were cooked nicely. This is a must have dish, in my opinion. The serving size is huge - 5 large scallops - like the rest of the food. \\nIf you're willing to plan ahead and be patient, Neptune will exceed your expectations with its excellent service and even better food."},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The Stimulus Menu is a great way to get a taste of what they serve without spending an arm and a leg.

I had the soup de jour, which was a gazpacho soup with lump crab: nothing to die for. However, I had the steak dish and it was simply delicious! He had the pork roast, which compared to the steak, fell flat. For dessert, we split the cheesecake.

We arrived around 10:30 on a Sunday morning prepared for a wait, and when we checked in with the hostess, we were told an hour and a half. But she took our phone number, so we were happy to stroll around with a cup of coffee from a nearby shop. After an hour, we decided it was best to stay close by, so we hung out on the sidewalk outside. (No benches or the offer of coffee while we wait, so not a comfortable one.) Through the window, we could see an empty 2-top and 4-top, and with no one else around waiting, were hopeful we'd be seated soon. Fifteen minutes pass, then thirty... Both tables still empty. Meanwhile, another 4-top opened up, and it took over ten minutes for anyone to come by to bus it. Twenty minutes after it was cleared, it was still empty. (It became a game to count how long their turn-over took. What can I say... We were bored.) We were FINALLY seated after waiting around outside for over another 45 minutes (for a total wait time of over an hour and forty-five minutes for those playing along) AT THE SAME 2-TOP WE'D NOTICED EMPTY 45 MINUTES EARLIER. That's just plain insulting. Under no circumstances should it have taken 45 minutes (or longer, given that it was already empty and cleared by the time we saw it) to tick through a waiting list and fill a table. And that 4-top we watched them clear at a snail's pace... it was still empty when we left. What the heck is the hostess even doing?? \\n\\nWe figured the food and drinks had to be pretty good after such a wait (and in any event we could have eaten a small horse at that point), so we ordered a Bloody Mary, a coffee cocktail and a smattering of sweet and savory dishes (small plates, served family style). My Bloody Mary came with a short, curly hair folded up in the pickle garnish, which I only noticed when I pulled the pickle off because I (thankfully) am not a fan. Gross!! The coffee cocktail also didn't have coffee in it, so we were a little confused by that one. Our drinks sat empty for several minutes before another server (not our original one) asked if we wanted another round. We  were barely half-way through our food, so we said yes, thinking the drinks would come within a reasonable time. We finished our food and still no drinks... Our server came by to check on us several minutes after our plates were empty, immediately said oops she forgot to check on our drinks, and disappeared before we could even cancel the drink order and ask for the check instead. When she brought us the now very late drinks a few minutes later, we told her we'd prefer the check instead at this point. She brought us back a check with a charge for the second round, even though they arrived long after we placed the order and well after we'd finished our meal. Not wanting to spend the time it would take to ask that the un-drunken drinks be taken off, we paid and left.\\n\\nThe food was OK, though I've definitely had better breakfast and brunch (with shorter and more comfortable waits) elsewhere in Portland. My husband is lactose intolerant, so we were pretty disappointed when all of our dishes came with cheese/cream, even though we'd asked for it to be on the side. I'm a former server and my husband is a former bar tender, so we're usually pretty sympathetic, but this place is a slow-motion train wreck.

That said, I like this place because all I really expect is for it to be better than its direct competition. And it delivers on that, as far as Kerbey Lane's south location goes. \\n\\nI also expect the place to be busy, and it usually delivers. Short waits seem common on weekends an late at night. I expect tasty-but-relatively-uninspired diner food (check) with some unexpected twists like the fabulous black beans and the gingerbread pancakes (check plus). I expect a decent variety of solid desserts and a cozy-trendy atmosphere (check). It even gives a little extra, since there's usually some interesting art on the walls.\\n\\nSo where do things begin to diverge? At a place like this, I also expect  friendly -- though perhaps busy or distracted -- servers. I've been here many times and only experienced truly bad service once, but service can be hit-or-miss for sure. You might even get someone really attentive, but... well, that's the definition of hit-or-miss, isn't it? I also expect my food to be cooked like I order it, which can be a big black mark... especially if you're picky about your eggs.\\n\\nAll in all, a good place that you might even like more than I do, depending on how much importance you place on that hipster-y aesthetic.

I was planning on having dinner elsewhere, but the fried chicken immediately got my attention. The meal was tasty but the service was terrible. I used to work at a restaurant, so I can pick up signs of a waitress pretty quickly. My waitress, Cheyenne, didn't introduce herself in a friendly manner. She came up to my table and said \\"just one?\\" (When there was clearly one menu on the table.). She didn't say hi, welcome, or ask: how are you?, or have you ever been here before? Whatever ... I told her that I was interested in the fried chicken meal and asked her about the sides. She said that they came with mash potatoes, green beans, or collard greens. The mac and cheese would be extra. I asked for collards and potatoes. Cheyenne refilled my water once, and spent the rest of the time engaging with coworkers and a table in front of me, who had 3 people and had alcohol. She brought my dinner to me and started to go to the 3 top in front of me. However, I told her that my plate had green beans instead of collards, and I also asked for hot sauce (since she didn't ask me if I needed anything else.) Cheyenne told me that she would fix my sides but that the kitchen was backed up. A few minutes later she told me that collards would be extra because they didn't come with the meal. She never acknowledged that she gave me the incorrect information, she tried to make me pay for the mistake, and subsequently, she never engaged with me after that's she just kept me talking with the table in front of me and nails and such. She also never tried to tell me what the dessert were. I felt that because the 3 top was spending more money, they got better service. In actually, every customer deserves good service, no matter what. That is what professionalism is.

It wasn't too salty and the flavor palate was wonderful. Later, I tried to dip everything in sight in this broth haha.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was interesting. It was served in a very flat bowl (or rounded plate) and tasted different from what I'm used to. It was very smooth, but a lot less milky than usual.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was pretty good. It was rich, buttery, and seasoned. They used the good parts of the lobster meat and not an overpowering amount of mayo (like some other places). \\n\\nThe highlight of the night was definitely the dinner special, the lobster risotto. This dish could have been disastrous, but it wasn't. It was AH-MAZING! The risotto was cooked to perfection and it wasn't too creamy or heavy.

Truly, we were the ONLY table in the restaurant.   \\n\\nThe manager came and offered his half apology which was something along the lines of \\"sorry...I don't really care about you, I could lose my job [if we have minors in the bar]\\"; I'm 23.   Again, not faulting them for following regulations, but I wish I was joking when I said those words came out of his mouth.  Then he told us that our new waitress should be there shortly and, \\"her name is um....\\" oh yeah he forgot her name-- but he assured us she was great.  \\n\\nWhen our second waitress got there she had us re-order drinks (another gal friend of mine had left her soda in the bar area), and even though we had already been there at least 20 minutes didn't ask about anything else.  She seemed less than excited to serve us.  A guy friend of mine mentioned at LEAST 3 times that it was my friends birthday which was reciprocated each time with nothing more than an awkward smile.  \\n\\nWhen most of us only ordered drinks and/or dessert the waitress seemed disappointed (I ordered 11 dollar calamari).  \\n\\nI paid with cash and so did my mother next to me and the waitress didn't even ASK if we wanted change she just took the cash and didn't bring back change when she brought back everyone's cards.  \\n\\nThe food: The portion of Calamari for 11 dollars was quite small.  There was more deep fried bell peppers than there were calamari.  There were MAYBE 6 little pieces of calamari and it was undercooked, limp and moist. They were obviously fried but had no crunch and a plain flavor.  My mom ordered a 9 dollar  Mojito (no happy hour discount in the restaurant area for my friends who ordered alcohol) that came with no lime and old soggy peppermint.  \\n\\nSummary: over priced AVERAGE to low quality food.

I opted for the Jason burger that had the slaw and fries on it also. On top of the traditional Pittsburgh items it also comes with fried egg and Genoa salami. Absolutely awesome burger, but with so many toppings you just can't fully sample all the flavors from all the toppings.

Well, I do thank you for the sample you gave me and it was good. Did it seem like you were eating a tube of lunch meat? \\n\\nDEREK: A word of advice needs to be given for some of the sides you may order. Do not let your fresh cut fries or onion rings get too cold. The fries get soggy and the onion rings loose their crispy texture if you let them sit too long.

Bread, heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers and such in a nice vinaigrette dressing.  Three of us munched on that one right off the plate and devoured it within minutes.  It was probably a bit small for 3, but we all got a nice taste.  I also ordered one of their elderflower-lemon house-made sodas.  That was refreshing.\\n\\nFor pizza we had the Margherita ($12) and the chop salami with mama lil's peppers, green olives & oregano  ($15).  I would hope nobody could f up a Margherita and they certainly didn't f it up here.  Nice char on both crusts.  The crust here is really good.  Nice and crisp on the outside and doughy in the middle.  The second pie was outstanding.  The difference here was the peppers.  Added a nice slightly sweet yet slightly spicy level that took this pie to another level.  Bravo Lovely Fifty-Fifty.\\n\\nFor dessert I had a scoop of their triple crown blackberry in a waffle cone.  They make their own ice cream so why wouldn't anyone want to eat that?  We had been craving ice cream all day so we finally got some.\\n\\nGuess what our final bill was between 3 of us.  No lie, but it was $50.50.  I was hoping for a free meal as we solved the menu, but that didn't happen.  I got out of there for $20 with tip and had a really good meal.

The first thing I ordered, years ago on my very first trip, was an italian sub. I managed to finish 1/4 of it, and for the following 2 days had some of the most delicious leftovers I can remember. The only drawback to the cafe, is that everyone else in town knows just how fantastic it is, just be prepared for a wait of an hour or more if you visit on the weekend. Monday or Tuesdays nights are ideal for quick seating and service. \\n\\nMost importantly, don't forget to invite me when you go. ; )"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So good!

The rice was also extremely lovely...and I ate every bite.  PS: Nice silverware!\\n\\nThe Bad:  I WANT MORE VEGETABLES!!!  The pure carnivores are probably gonna be the ones going for the rice plate with the shredded pork, crab cake and egg plus meat...if it says mine comes with veggies, please don't be afraid to pile them on.  I hate it when there's just a shred or two.  *sad*\\n\\nThe Ugly:  I had to use my knife and fork to eat the short ribs...but they only have a butter knife-esque thing to cut with...pretty irritating.  It was a workout.   Also, we left feeling kinda hungry...hmmm.  Maybe I'm just  turning into an oink-oink.  If there had been bubble tea, this wouldn't be an issue, I'm sure. *waaaah*  Aaaand, I don't know if I can attribute this to the food at Com (I'm suspicious), but I starting feeling kinda sick on my stomach when we got home...still feeling puke-y.  *arg*\\n\\nAnyway, the free dessert was really nice.

One of the times I sat at the bar and the bartender didn't even look in our direction for about a solid 10 minutes, not a \\"be right with you\\" or anything but rather straight ignored- and they weren't even that busy (there were a bunch of bar stools open)!\\n\\nAnother time I had made a reservation for 3 of us the night before.

When we arrived at the front desk to check in, the host said that there was no reservation at all under my name even though I had spoken to 2 people prior to me coming in and they assured me our table was reserved?\\n\\nAdditionally, there has been 2 or 3 times that I have been with a group of friends and felt so rudely rushed off my table.

After waiting way too long, the next disappointment came in the presentation of the food. My chicken sandwich was TINY, and was accompanied by coleslaw, which I ordered only because they were out of chips. He did refill our drinks, but did ask how our meals were or if we needed anything else until we were almost finished.

It was cut and displayed with the cut ends up, then covered in sauces.  Beautiful presentation, but difficult to pick up and bite in to.  The filling was excellent with Rice and Fries, so if you're counting carbs, you better be able to count pretty high.  The \\"chips\\" that came with it were absolutely disgusting.

I have never had enough positive or negative motivation to write one. And I normally don't want to write something that could hurt someone's business. \\n\\nI ordered here. Waited about 30 minutes for my food. They got the order wrong and made it way too spicy, when I asked for it not to be not spicy at all. It was so red that my friend asked me if I was really going to eat it. So I asked them if they could remake it again with less spice in it, since I had asked it not to be spicy. They made me wait another 30 minutes and brought me the same EXACT dish, but they just waited a bit and re-heated it because it looked exactly the same as the last one. After I said that there was no way I could eat this because it was too spicy, the waitress goes back in and comes back out and says sorry and that this was the least spicy they could make it. \\n\\nThen I ask if I could have another type of dish that's just less spicy overall. After looking very unhappy, the waitress goes back in the kitchen and comes back out and says \\"Sorry we just took the chicken from the same batch and told you it wasn't spicy.

At least I no longer have to explain to people that this Pho Pasteur is owned by a different branch of the family that runs all the Le's and has a different menu/quality. It was a good place for me to visit to get flavorful vegetarian dishes back in the day that I was one, a place to escape to when subjected to only being able to touch *possibly* one dish out of 10 at a Chinese banquet. But... I am past those days. I still order the tofu lemongrass on occasion and an order of cold rolls from here. The tofu lemongrass has a good, flavorful kick with a slightly sweet sauce, so it isn't just heat. It's a well-balanced dish.\\n\\nI came in today because I am a measure under the weather and needed my share of lipids. I was about to go into Thien Thien and was slightly put-off by what I had at Pho Hoa, so I'll give the old standby another shot. In the past, I'm used to the food being middling, but this time, it was significantly better than in the past. The cuts of eye rounds were massive, about the diameter of a baseball and four cuts worth. The brisket was good, being not gummy and easily flaking in the mouth, able to tear it with the tip of my chopsticks being ground together. There was only a small amount of tendon, flank, and tripe, but it was a lot of the others. The tendon was only so-so, the tripe properly prepared, but not as finely as Pho So or Pho Hoa. The ratio of noodles to beef had the noodles squarely outnumbered, just having broth, herbs, and bean sprouts to eat the remaining cuts. It's definitely neater for me to eat the yellow mein instead of the white pho, the less slick quality not splashing around that much. The broth was flavorful, not too salty, and of an average color compared to the others in the area. The bean sprouts were uncut at the tips, but clean, the plate dry, meaning it was not put under the wash and immediately thrown on the plate.\\n\\nThis seems to be the only pho restaurant in Chinatown that keeps chilis at the table anymore, but this is both a good and bad thing. Some were of questionable freshness, so I had to pick through the pile. It is very, very good Pho, but I wish it had more noodles.\\n\\nNow excuse me while I SCREAM IN PAIN because I rubbed my eye and did not clean off all the capsaicin from my finger!!!\\n\\nDishes to try: Your favorite pho, any lemongrass dish"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Seriously good food.

Me and and a friend decided to try it again in case the recipe had changed and it did but not necessarily for the best.  The crust was much better but the sauce was sort of sweet in a duck sauce kind of way.  Forward to 2010.  I ordered a chicken burrito from here because it was cheap and I had some Foodler bucks to kill.  NASTY.  Ugh.  The burrito was filled with tasteless chicken, bland beans, plain white rice with no flavor and a gummy texture, and nothing else.  What an atrocity!  Last forward to 2011.  Two weeks ago my mom ordered a large buffalo wing from here because they use fresh wings.  We held our breath and crossed our fingers.  Their buffalo wings are absolutely delicious.  The blue cheese dressing they give you is loaded with large chunks of blue cheese.  I am drooling as I type this.

Two fluffy tall biscuits barely holding bacon, cheese, a fried chicken breast, an egg, and sops of gravy together demanded not just hands and teeth but a fork. And knife.\\n\\nEven so, I didn't see many unclean plates in the dish bin, and I'm proud to say that mine was as free of leftovers as everyone else's. Consider that a testament to tastiness; you can't, you won't, and you don't stop until every biscuit crumb is gone. \\n\\nPine State is a good biscuit joint for those who need even MOAR than the basics on their biscuit, from the aforementioned fried chicken in various guises to steak and even some Podnah's. A Southern shout-out runs through the menu, as you can also get shrimp-n-grits, an andouille corn dog, and sides of things like black-eyed peas, hushpuppies, and fried green tomatoes. And if the teetering stack is just too much, you can get your biscuit simplified (like with just egg, or egg and cheese, or egg and cheese and meat, or just jam, or - my next choice - pimiento cheese spread). Important note: best gravy in town.\\n\\nThe coffee's excellent for a breakfast place; I know everywhere in Portland has good coffee, but they don't all make it well - especially on a Saturday morning. And especially a place as busy as this. When my friend and I arrived around 9 am, the line was barely creeping out the door, and we didn't have to wait for a seat. When we left about an hour later, it snaked in thick clumps out, around, and down the block. Moral: go early, or go patient. \\n\\nIn the Portland biscuit pantheon, these aren't quite my favorite ones; I'm taken with the huge buttery ones at TILT, but also like the quiet demure fluffiness in a smaller biscuit like those at Bushel and Peck or City State. Pine State's are good but a bit dense for me (though they kind of have to be, given what they must enfold). I think I'm also either a purist (egg, bacon, and cheese!) or an artisan (some unique sauce or spread) in taste; these biscuits read more like lunch or dinner to me in the combos. I hope to return late in the day, late in the week, and explore more of the menu (I do love my Southern sides) without the crowds.

They offer 20% discount off your bill (excluding the \\"kitchen specials\\" on the dim sum menu) if you:\\n\\n- settle your bill between 9am and 3pm Monday to Friday, and\\n- place your order by 11am on Saturdays, Sundays & Holidays\\n\\nVivacity takes order of your dim sum requests from a bilingual order sheet that you check off and present to the wait staff.  Menu ordering for dim sum is being more and more common with many Chinese restaurants.  It beats ordering from carts being pushed around so you don't have to ask what it is in the basket every time the carts come around and your conversation will not get interrupted every time a cart pusher asks if you this or that.\\n\\nThe only drawback of menu ordering for dim sum is that you don't know how many pieces of dumplings there are in each order so you can order accordingly based on the number in your party.\\n\\nWe order 9 dishes for lunch based on the naming of the dishes on the menu by the restaurant:\\n\\n- Steamed pork dumplings (aka siu mai) - 4 big flavourful pieces.\\n\\n- Pan fried water chestnut cake (squares) -  4 pieces of lightly sweetened gelatin squares with water chestnut chunks in side.  They are good dessert alternatives to the popular egg tarts or sesame seed balls.\\n\\n- Steamed pork dumplings with peanuts (aka Chiuchow dumplings) - The order came with 4 pieces.  I am not a fan of this type of dumpling because there are a lot of ingredients in the stuff (ground pork, vegetables, peanuts ...) and there are just too many things going on for me.\\n\\n- Steamed spareribs with Japanese pumpkin - If you like fatty meat and crunchy cartilage, it is a common dim sum dish with a twist using Japanese pumpkin in lieu of black bean sauce, offering alighter alternative in terms of flavour (definitely not calories but you shouldn't be counting calories when you have dim sum anyways).\\n\\n- Steamed pork roll wrapped with bean curds (not really bean curds but soy bean sheets) - 3 solidly good pieces.\\n\\n- Steamed duck tongue with special sauce (technically braised, not steamed) - the tongues were very flavourful.  Allen had an obligatory one but I don't think he'll have another one because he doesn't like the texture nor the idea.  I liked it.\\n\\n- Steamed chicken buns - There are 3 pieces in the basket.  I usually don't like the BBQ pork bun type of buns but the introduction of ginger in the chicken buns won me over.\\n\\n- Deep fried pork dumplings (aka salt water dumplings or ) - 4 solidly good pieces.  Flavour was a bit on the light which was what I preferred.\\n \\n- Homemade style baked pastry - The name doesn't really tell you much.  It is a regional item from northern and central China called  or yellow bridge baked pastry.  They are little pastry with a flakey outer crust sprinkled with roasted sesame seeds stuffed with pork.  My parents liked it but I didn't - just my personal preference.\\n\\nThe bill came to just under $35 for the 4 of us before gratuities.  Not bad for lunch!

I've seen women take taxis to Clery's just to wait in line on a Friday and Saturday.

The beers are fairly reasonably priced, but the crowd is so weird.  I was buzzed at about 11:00pm when I decided to take a lap and see what the clientele looked like.  They were predominantly older women dawning the putrid pink Red Sox hat.  Maybe this was just a reflection of the night that I went.

I can't remember the first time I ate here. Probably ten years ago, which for a strapping lad of 23 is a long time. Back then we'd make the Odyssean journey from the suburbs, navigating the vagaries of public transportation required to plunge into heaping never-ending Combo plates which we rarely finished one of.\\n\\nNow, I rarely make the Herculean attempt, and stick with the more modest -- and extremely reasonably priced -- pulled pork solo. Word to the wise: the jerk beef always sounds like a good idea, but never ever is. Perhaps there are those with more (Hephaestian?) fortitude for heat than I, but I always regret choosing the sandwich three bites in. And the problem is not so much that the heat is too intense, which it is, but that it completely overwhelms any other experience of the sandwich. All the other flavors carefully woven into the meat and fixin's are fire-razed away.\\n\\nMore than the food, though, what's striking here is the atmosphere. Looking over my decade of patronage, I can't remember any remarkably bad service, and have more stories of unusually good service than I can share here. Most recently, we had a waiter who was a bit absent-minded, but fixed his mistakes immediately every time, concluding in a free pulled pork sandwich for the few bites of one that my friend had asked to be packed up and had gotten accidentally thrown away.\\n\\nThe only thing that has changed over the time I've been going here is my over-21 ID, and discovering Underbones. This is now my go-to bar in Davis. Great beer menu, an even better late-night snack menu, tables if you want them with service, and Dionysian events (often featuring free appetizers).\\n\\nIf that weren't cake enough, the icing is very reasonably-priced catering. Just thinking about it makes me wish I had a chafing dish full of delicious pork slathered in hot sauce in front of me.\\n\\nIf Redbones gets any marks off, it's definitely not vegetarian-friendly. I can't off the top of my head remember anything more substantial than hush puppies that would appeal to an ovo-lacto. So, sorry, guys, but maybe you should try elsewhere. But, really, what were you expecting from a down home Southern barbecue joint?\\n\\nThere's a reason that Redbones has so many die-hard loyalists. Actually, a whole bunch of reasons.

I have never had a Lamb Rendang so tender and well cooked. The gravy reminded me of a Indian Goat Curry!! I loved this dish and hoped it never finished. Lamb Chops cooked with a rich blend of ground onions, lemon grass and chili in a spicy curry!! \\nThe second dish was the House special Char Mee. This was crispy yellow egg noodles cooked in a full flavored soy sauce sauteed with pork, squid, shrimp and mixed vegetables. The noodles were nicely cooked and were like shanghai noodles. The greens were crunchy and tender and juicy all together!! All the meats were very flavorful and the best part was the fried onions they used to garnish the dish. The last dish was the house special fried rice... It sounded like any normal fried rice but definitely don't miss this.... It is fried rice prepared with shrimp, chicken, beef, green peas, some fresh basil and egg. The rice had a nice spicy flavor to it which left me very satisfied indeed. We wanted to end the experience with the Bubor Cha Cha desert, but they were all out of that dish... boohoo... Maybe next time. We had the Ice Kacang instead. It is shaved ice with red bean, corn, palm seed, jelly, red rose syrup and coconut milk.

For an app, an entree and four beers the bill came to a couple pennies under $30. Not to bad for a night out if your not looking to spend a whole lot. The wait staff was kind but not too talkative and the theme of the restaurant made for a quiet and enjoyable experience.

I came here last Sunday for Brunch after wanting to try this place for months and I must say I will be coming back again.  The food is delicious to say the least.  My boyfriend and I were seated right away, and I must say I was surprised considering the previous reviews I read about the wait.  However we did go around 11-11:30 so that may have made a difference.  Either way, I'm glad we didn't have to wait.  Valet is $2, which was not bad at all, considering there's no where else to park you car lol.  After being seated and ordering we were brought out some biscuits and muffins before our meal.  I loved the biscuits, but I didn't try the muffins.  However, my boyfriend did and said they were good.  I opted for the Hazelnut French Toast which was the bomb.  The slices are big ( I think they use challah bread, don't know if I spelled it correctly) but it was good to say the least, and the price for it was decent.  I didn't like the grits, but please don't take my word for it on them.  I am very picky when it comes to my grits and I like them extra creamy.  They were traditional and grainy, but if that's your thing, you will love them.\\n\\nUPDATE!!! Try their Parmesan crusted chicken. It's on the bunch menu and it is just as good as their French toast. It is covered in lemon butter, mixed with bacon and watercress, and topped with your choice of egg cooked. The biscuits are delectable as well with the cinnamon butter offered as a spread.

I've been craving fried pickles for a while and the only other place I know in Boston to get them doesn't really live up to my expectations. The pickles at Clery's, on the other hand, were delicious. The specials menu said that they were gherkins, but the basket I got was sliced up dill pickle spears. I have no problem with that though. I don't care if they're pickle chips, gherkins, or just chopped up pieces, as long as they're bite size. Any bigger and the pickle to breading ratio is all off. They came with a ranch dip that I used sparingly, since pickles really don't need much help. I also had a honey lemonade cocktail, which was perfect. Not too sweet or too strong.

He called his buddies from med school who are still the area and before we know it, we are strolling into Thurman's Cafe asking for a party of 7 at 7:30pm on a Friday evening. \\n\\nWe had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table (expected), but after a long ride, all of us were ready to stand in the lobby/outside and pound some local beers. By the time we were all crammed into a booth everyone was practically lapped up - so I'm glad we weren't sober. The place is tiny!!!!!!but the wings are huge!!!!!!! The burgers are huge!!!!!!!!! - but all of it is great. Its one thing to go to a place and order big portions that taste like crap....its quite another to get huge portions of great food and great service, which is what we got at Thurman's. Server and my wife spoke to each other in Spanish the whole night, much to the amusement of our table. I can personally vouge for the Western Burger (med rare) and Melissa has something delicious with Blue cheese and bacon. \\n\\nOnly thing I would recommend is come with one or two people tops and come off hours, I doubt they can sit more than 40 people. For a place that serves the best burger in town which is featured on Man Vs Food with Adam Richmond, I'm shocked that can't add another room. Am I missing something?

Maybe I just like to consume BBQ sauce and just need an excuse to do so; throw in a few baked beans and it's a bona fide dish to me. Not sure. I mean, I am very sure that their bbq baked beans are very good; I'm just kind of now questioning my relationship with bbq sauce.

Yelpers never steer us wrong, so never again. While there were many open tables, I assume for reservations, we didn't have one so had to sit at the bar. Not their fault. However, the view was less than ideal considering the bartender was washing glasses in front of us. One positive note, we did see how hard the chefs and cooks were working. As native New Yorkers, we felt this place was overpriced for Portland for the quality of food. It seems like overall the place is confused about what cuisine they are going for. We were here for well over an hour and 45 minutes, longer than we had hoped. On a positive note, the curry leaf chutney was awesome (came with the samosas which I could take or leave) and the fish special was quite tasty and well cooked.

My friends and I came back for lunch a couple weeks later to mixed reviews but came to the conclusion that the hype is bigger than the delivery.\\n\\nService is slow and inefficient. It was an hour wait for seating (despite the waiter saying 30 min). Once we did get our seats, it was another 15 min before we got menus. Another 15 min before being able to place our orders, a 45 min wait for our appetizers and food. We asked for bread early on so we could stave off hunger but it was delivered after we received our food, making it obsolete. \\n\\nAs for the food, the Johnny Cake appetizer was very good, as were the fried clams. The tartar sauce for the clams, however, tasted like straight pickle juice. The long awaited lobster roll was very disappointing. Our waiter recommended the hot lobster roll, so that's what we went with. The bread roll would have been forgettable if not for the fact that it was only toasted on the outside, making the roll complete mush from the drenching of straight melted butter. Although I prefer lobster dipped/coated/ whatever in butter. There was so much butter that it brought down the lobster.

Unfortunately, I went during a stormy day, so there wasn't much of a view -- but it was still packed. The bar was full (probably for happy hour) and there was a live pianist. This is a great location for date night! I went on Prom night and it was adorable to see all these students dressed up in prom dresses. \\n\\nI ordered the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO as an appetizer. It was the perfect tomato seafood broth to warm me up on this cold day. There was so much seafood in it! I had a fat piece of salmon and a ton of calamari and scallops. I highly recommend this dish. Probably one of the better cioppinos I've ever had. \\n\\nFor our main entree, we ordered the RACK OF LAMB and BONELESS RIBEYE. Both came with mashed potatoes. The rack of lamb was good, but not incredible. There wasn't a ton of flavor nor was it as juicy as the color made it seem. The ribeye, on the other hand, was actually quite good and comparable to a steakhouse. I'd recommend that over the lamb. \\n\\nI also had the sweetest waitress. She was incredibly kind. Even though it was packed and she couldn't always tend to us, when she did come, she'd always make sure to ask us how we're doing and make quick small talk.

The entrees were excellent, especially the Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodle. \\n\\nWe had someone in our group that doesn't like Thai food, but she couldn't stop eating the fried rice. The great thing is that the food was spicy, but still had all of the Thai flavors. If you order food very spicy at some restaurants, all you taste is hot spice. But that wasn't the case here.\\n\\nThey also have homemade hot sauce if you want to add more spice. The other great part are the low prices- all of our entrees were under $10 each.

You have the choice of honey wheat crust or white for all the pizzas. If you have problems with gluten, on Thursdays they have a gluten-free dough option. \\n\\nTheir salads are fantastic. I love the in-house made dressings. The vinegar flavor of some of the vinaigrettes may be to forward for some, but I love a strong vinegar taste. I almost always get a large salad and a large pizza-- this can easily feed four. The lasagna, however, is a bit bland. \\n\\nMama Mimi's has a frequent buyer program, if you're into that kind of thing. \\n\\nAs for this particular location: it's relatively convenient if you're in the north-UA area, in a small strip mall on Henderson road.

It is a normal sit down restaurant where you order from a menu (I have no idea how someone thought \\"Cafeteria\\" was a good word to add to the restaurant name).   I got the blue burger.  First off, the fries are tasty, and are very well seasoned; they tasted like fresh potatoes and are slim cuts.  These are some of my favorite fries in Austin.  The condiments for the burger were served on the side which was nice because that way I can choose what goes on, the tomatoes were really red and ripe.  The burger had a blue cheese sauce which was really creamy, but I thought it could have been bolder on the actual blue cheese.  The bacon was crisp, no fat, and there was plenty of it.  The bun did not tasted fresh baked, but was not bad.  The patty had a nice char taste.  Dang was it pricey, so my recommendation is if you are going for a burger, go on a Tuesday when it is $6 (I am sure the blue cheese/bacon toppings are more, but hopefully less than the egregious $11.75 which I paid)."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"1143 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"The worst service ever by a Manager.

My friends thought their meals were too greasy and salt.  The cook played his music super loud, so it was hard to have a conversation with my friends.

We got the shrimp and grits and the shrimp po'boy. The shrimp and grits were spicy but worked perfectly with red wine gravy. The shrimp po'boy had a nice fried batter, not too heavy, and the remoulade sauce gave it that finishing touch. Of course we had to finish off the meal with some beignets.

After a while we got tired of waiting for the bartender to notice us so asked for menus.  After a while longer I got tired of waiting for him to notice that there was a pile of crumbs on top of a sticky drink spill in front of me so asked him if he could wipe it up.  He then finally asked us if we wanted drinks.  We each ordered a beer and a water.  We got the beers... but not the waters.  A while later my girlfriend asked for a water.  He then brought us both waters (so clearly he knew he forgot) but without any apology.  Do you notice a trend?  All along he was unengaging, unapologetic, and somewhat oblivious.\\nI'm generally pretty forgiving with service and try to give the benefit of the doubt.  This however, was just over the top.\\n\\nThe pizza?  Not bad.  We had the Mustafar.  The ghost pepper salami was fantastic.  The portobello mushrooms and arugula were a nice complement.

When you are finished with that, you turn over a chip on your table from black to orange and the food starts rolling in.  \\n\\nI was most enamored with the sirloin, they constantly re-rub it with spices and re-char the outside so each slice is perfect.  The filet was melt-in-your-mouth and the paremsan-crusted pork was amazing.  We tried every single meat, and for the most part liked them all.  On the salad bar, they also have some rice, beans, and rolls for sides but when the meat starts coming, they bring you mashed potatoes (the creamiest I EVER had), fried polenta, and fried bananas.  I wished I hadn't had the rice, as good as it was, because i could eat those potatoes forever.\\n\\nThere was no chance that we were reaching dessert.  The managers and waitstaff were exemplary (one member of the group found the salmon too salty.  A waitstaffer noticed that she didn't finish her slice and asked what was wrong.  The guest mentioned the saltiness but wasn't complaining...there was a ton of other food on the table.  Within minutes the GM was out there offering a new piece of salmon, which our guest agreed was excellent.)  \\n\\nFor the trick, visit their website, sign up for their \\"preferred diner\\" club, and get a buy one/get one free coupon.

If I could just block the noise level, the ambiance and aromas would surely transport me to the sun kissed sunflower fields of the French country side, I to date cherish.\\n\\nFor the first course we ordered Onion Tart and French Onion Soup. The tart appeared to be placed on a puff pastry loaded with bacon (American Style) rather than the classic buttery crust, the French are so well known for. I felt cheated!  It was the base for both the Onion Tart and Apple tart for dessert.  Not to mention the odd scone shaped, under baked pastry on top of the Boeuf Bourguignon. It was totally unnecessary especially as the dish was dressed with egg noodles.\\n\\nThe French Onion Soup on the other hand was outstandingly brimming in deep flavors. One couldn't get enough of it. \\n\\n Being a lover of everything French - I couldn't resist ordering my favorites - Chicken Pate (house made) and Blood Sausage.  The Pate' was delicate and served warm at Le Coq au Vin. I have to confess I was a bit confused with the lettuce, raw onions, and tomato accompanying the Pate', as if they were thrown together as an afterthought? The tomato's turned out to be fresh tomato jam, lightly flavored.  Brioche might have been a finer choice as a vessel for the Pate' rather than the crusty bread, lightly toasted.\\n\\nThe blood sausage was perhaps the best I have had in Florida. Don't be afraid to try this dish because of its name. You might just be surprised as to how much you enjoy it.\\n\\nOur entrees were Boeuf Bourguignon and Coq au Vin.  I expected the Coq au Vin to triumph in taste especially since the restaurant boasts its name to this dish. It was presented well however tasted a tad on the drier side.\\n\\nTo end our meal, we ordered the Apple Tart and the classic Crepes Suzette. To my disappointment, I saw the same puff pastry crust appear on the apple tart.

This time I ordered the Sicilian hash and I can honestly say its one of the most flavorful, decadent breakfast plates ever! Simply delicious. I paired this meal with a tasty Bloody Mary that came with homemade pickled beet root, cauliflower and celery. \\n\\nOne of the things that I loved about this restaurant was the quality of their ingredients.

The location is very very small (bar like atmosphere) I expected to wait in line for a while cause I had been warned. So I didn't mind that. \\nWalked into the restaurant and didn't get greeted until 5 minutes after standing by the door. \\nFirst up was clam chowder... which the reviews were just fantastic on this! The chowder was extremely watery. I was surprised. However the waitress said they don't use anything to thicken their broth so it had sense... had large pieces of clams so I was pleased, but some of the potatoes in the chowder were hard and didn't seemed to be cooked through. OK taste, just not what you usually expect clam chowder to be. \\nAlso ordered a dozen oysters (which just like union and ICOB were very fresh and served to order) also ordered shrimp cocktail... the shrimp sizes did not disappoint however how can you even go wrong with shrimp cocktail?!\\nAlso ordered the mussels. And I must say I was not happy what so ever. The mussel meat was extremely hard to get out of the shell... which is not usual for mussels and the broth was spicey and extremely fatty tasting (heavy on the butter- no acid to cut through it)\\nOverall I wasn't very satisfied with Neptune Oysters and would prefer the other 2 locations any day!"},{"name":"Cosmo's Pizza","address":"1325 Broadway St, Ste 108","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"My favorite pizza, and open late!

I also had the Chatfield, and while the apple butter was so rich and buttery that we bought some to take home with us, it didn't bring the moisture or flavor to complement the savory fried chicken like the gravy did. I seem to remember the steak biscuit being very dry and a little on the tough side of things compared to the juicy, succulent chicken, and the seasonal fruit biscuit was nothing too special -- there are definitely better options out there to satisfy a sweet tooth.

It's one of those things you might not think about very often. But when you eat a freshly made, hot, flaky biscuit you remember why. And when they're done right it can be an amazing culinary experience. Add butter, gravy, bacon, or chicken to the mix and it can be a downright taste bud revolution. I had one of these revolutions recently at Pine State Biscuits. Located in the Belmont district of PDX this small restaurant was bustling with customers and serving some tasty eats. Very earthy and inviting is the atmosphere of this laidback joint that has been around since 2008. The seating is limited and 1st come 1st serve so if you have a large party be prepared to wait. Having brought the entire clan with me I felt the pain of trying to seat 6 people. It is, BTW, worth the wait. After agonizing over the menu choices (it all looks SO good) I decided to order,\\" The Reggie,\\" which consists of fried chicken, bacon, cheese and gravy. Without hesitation, I can say that the right decision was made. Or was it? Sweet monkeys, what have I done? Did I just ruin my expectations for every biscuit I would eat in the future? Was it too over the top with the superbly fried chicken, cheese and the bacon?\\n\\nOhhhhh, bacon...\\n\\nAnd let's not forget about the gravy. Made from scratch and just begging to have every last drop consumed, mopped up by the aforementioned king of the biscuits. This meal was such a delicious conundrum. A brief, way too brief, encounter with a dish that was eaten so quickly and with extreme delight it was over way too soon. The flavors of the buttery biscuit, the crunchiness and spices of the juicy chicken, salty bacon, cheese and the texture and flavor of the gravy made me want more. More of the perfection that is Pine State Biscuits. Fortunately, having some dignity and self control, I left Pine State Biscuits before I could do anything foolish. \\n\\nBut I know things will be alright and It's ok because I will return, and will be bringing my appetite with me."},{"name":"Happy Lamb Hot Pot","address":"4755 Kingsway, Ste 200","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Looks they actually have a location in Bellevue...I'm sooooo there."},{"name":"Creole Kitchen","address":"1052 Mt Vernon Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Food was absurdly good for the price.

Being new to the area, I asked him if he had been in Atlanta long and what he would recommend doing/seeing. He said he is an Atlanta native and had plenty of recommendations and was easy to talk to. The second time I came was during brunch, and I was disappointed to discover they didn't offer the Spaghetti Squash Bowl during that time as I had my heart set on it, but that was only because I didn't know they only offered it at different times of the day. The server was polite in explaining that to me. I opted for the Murphy's Classic Burger and was pleased with that decision. For appetizers during brunch, we had these EXQUISITE little muffins and rolls with very, very tasty jams/spreads/butter. Easy to be naughty with the carbs on that plate.

The line is long but it moves fairly fast so you need to have your order ready! I had the roast lamb with tomato chutney and goat cheese. The meals are made to order so they take your name and shout it when ready amongst the large waiting crowd. It was about a 10 min wait. Meanwhile I received my Oreo cookie and herbal ice tea and looked for a seat. This place is organized chaos and loud. It's packed in the dining area so it's easiest to grab a seat if you are just solo or with another person. There is a small playground / park across from Flour where you could eat outside. \\n\\nThe sandwiches are all $7.95 and there are lots to choose from. You can even get half a sandwich for $4.95. It was hard to make a decision with so many great choices. The sandwich I had was room temperature with the cold goat cheese. The bread is fantastic - soft and flavourful. The sandwich had lots of fresh flavour and was very filling but didn't feel like I over ate. Also tried the grilled roasted chicken - brie, arugula, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions. For some reason, the grilled sandwich isn't as good as the non-grilled ones. The key to this place is their bread and the bread makes the sandwich so for me, grilling the sandwich mutes the flavour of the bread as it ends up tasting like any bread could be used. I would recommend a non-grilled sandwich here.\\n\\nThe Oreo cookie was a disappointment. I've made a better version. The cookie part is bitter and kind of gritty and does not resemble an Oreo at all. The white filling is slightly closer though less sweet than the original. \\n\\nThe herbal ice tea is lightly sweetened and very delicious. All I all my total lunch was just under $14.

Everything looked good on the menu but the candied bacon won me over. \\n\\nA couple of things to note: first, there is just street parking at the downtown location so that might be an issue. We had to park a few blocks away and walk. The other is that this place is small and fills up fast at breakfast and lunch so you better get here early if you don't want to wait. It can also be a bother to get through the room to get to the bathrooms in the back. Like I said, this place gets packed.\\n\\nDefinitely worth it though, even if you have to wait.

Primarily because it's a small and quaint establishment. The place itself is decorated fairly nicely, although a bit cliche, and is comfortably lit quite dimly. In regards to the TV, the employees will have no problem turning it off for any patrons, man up if you have a request, the worst they can do is say no (or spit in your food... JK^^).\\n\\nOrders are prepared quickly and everything is hot when you receive it. The hot tea and miso soup are scalding hot, which is a big plus in my book. Any deep fried order you get is coated in a light batter that doesn't overwhelm you and doesn't taste like it's been fried in extremely old oil. Some of the rolls are a little basic and taste bland, but you have to really try rolls like the Crazy & Spider here. Not to mention all of this is pretty cheap and will satisfy that sushi craving for a reasonable price.\\n\\nOh yeah, they have booze.

I'm not really a huge fan of fish and chips, but I do enjoy it when the batter is a beer batter.  While the fish was very tender and the breading was nice and crispy, the batter itself didn't have much beer flavor.  I wouldn't mind it if they were a bit heavier handed on the lager.  My boyfriend says he really enjoyed the shepherd's pie, though, and says it was much better than the shepherd's pie at Raglan Road, which we had eaten a few days prior.  I would probably order something different during my next visit to Rose & Crown, but it was definitely worth a try. \\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding and my boyfriend ordered the chocolate nougat bar.  The sticky toffee pudding was REALLY amazing.  The vanilla custard and the hotter buttered rum sauce really complimented the toffee cake very well.  If you go to Rose & Crown Dining Room, be sure to order this wonderful dessert.  My boyfriend enjoyed the chocolate nougat bar, but said it was more nougat tasting rather than chocolate tasting, which was fine with him. \\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend Rose & Crown if you like British food, or if you really like toffee cake.

I actually preferred the red sauce pasta, but only because I'm a huge fan of tomatoes (and apparently, heartburn...) I did enjoy the tender meatball, which was the star of the meal, but at a questionable $4...idk... I believe the pastas are a little pricey for what it is (ie serving sizes and because it's just pasta...) but this place is worth a try.

It was good - a new twist on smoked salmon with the olive oil. I thought the plums could've been more ripe (they seemed to be too hard compared to the rest of the dish) and a hint of flavor (lemon?) could've enhanced the olive oil.\\n\\nFor my main dish, I was torn between the lobster caprese salad and the Georges Bank scallops - though since I don't like tomatoes, I was advised not to order the salad. Scallops it was.\\n\\nThe scallops came with duck confit, Brussel sprouts, blue cheese and D'anjou pear sauce. The quality of the scallops was good, but I felt distracted by the duck confit to really be able to enjoy them. The dish was too complex;  why not cut out the confit and just highlight the flavor of the scallops? Needless to say, I ate the entire dish, so it was still pretty good.\\n\\nPaired it with a full bodies Cab/Merlot blend from Napa, I had a good meal but would say this place needs to work on simplifying some of its dishes before I would give them another star.\\n\\nAtmosphere is wonderful - hexagonal tiles and soft music playing hits from the 40s and 50s gives a retro feeling.\\n\\nOverall - it was pretty good; I would go back again but would be more selective on what I order.

We came early on a Thursday morning which was perfect; we didn't have to wait, but when we left a line was forming. I ordered the Reggie Deluxe (seemed to be a Yelp favorite) and my friend ordered the Chatfield. Both were out of this world. My biscuit included a fried egg, fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and was smothered in delicious sausage gravy. My friend's had apple butter on it, which seemed odd but totally worked. I've had some great fried chicken in my life and this was up there on the list. These guys make a mean biscuit sandwich. \\n\\nAll in all, worth the wait even if the line is out the door. Your tummy won't be disappointed."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I weren't sure what we wanted, so we ordered quite a bit... we had a pepperoni pizza, wings (the entire wing, not just flats or flaps) in teriyaki and BBQ, and fries... plenty of left overs!\\nThe  pizza had extremely thin crust with pepperoni which bowled up - both of which are my favorites!

I've been gluten free for 7 years and can't believe the dedication this place has to make things safe for celiac & gluten intolerant eaters. Bravo. My hats are off to them because not only is it safe but it also taste good! The worst is when my friends say \\"They have gluten free blah, blah, blah\\" and not only is it expensive, it taste like crap! Throughout my travels, this has to be one of the best gluten free restaurants I've come across and their baked goods are to rave about. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I stopped in here for Sunday brunch and I really was just expecting a few items and the standard - eggs, bacon, sausage. Everything you find inherently gluten free. For a restaurant to make standard, normal, glutenous fare and to trick anyone into eating it gluten free without really knowing, now that takes talent. Wild Wood Bake House does this amazingly well.\\n\\nI felt like a kid in a candy store and piled my plate high with everything I normally can't eat like: chicken tenders, macaroni & cheese, waffle, biscuits and gravy. I also added their stuffed avocado, migas and bacon. The mac & cheese was really good. The sauce was thick and had excellent cheddar flavor but the real pi√®ce de r√©sistance was the biscuits & gravy! The biscuits were actually fluffy! This might seem trite to some but this is a big deal with gluten free bakers. To get fluff, maintain the integrity, all while make said baked good tasty, now that takes ALOT of practice and talent. I partnered the fluffy amazement with the cream gravy and I was in food heaven. The cream gravy was very smooth and tasty. You could definitely taste the heavy cream. I think the only thing that could make it better was to add sausage, but I'll take what I can get and it was darn good.\\n\\nAfter we stuffed ourselves, I didn't realize that we walked right pass the dessert case when we entered! I had to check it out. The selection was amazing in terms of sweets but they also offer savory baked goods too. I did want to buy a whole carrot cake for myself but thought that might be overdoing it for one girl. Maybe I'd let my boyfriend have 1/18th of the cake? I digressed and got two cupcakes instead - a red velvet and a carrot cake. Both were very excellent. Light crumb, moist and not overly sweet. The carrot cake had a tad too much cinnamon that overpowered it a bit but over all they were both terrific. Frosting on both was light and complemented the cake's flavor. Wild Wood Bake House does an amazing job with their baked goods. I still can't get over how they're gluten free. Baking sans gluten is volatile at best, so save yourself and just buy everything from them!  \\n\\nThe reason for 4 stars and is due to the fact several of the items were overcooked in the buffet. That is certainly understandable given the nature how buffets operate but I will be back again to order off their regular menu. This way I can update the review and give it the 5 stars I know it can be!"},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"When I'm craving Middle-Eastern food I go to Halal Bros because it's good and close to campus.\\n\\nI usually get the lamb over rice which is always delicious. It literally rice, meat, 'salad' on the side, and white sauce drizzled over all of it. The white sauce is really good and from my experience if you want more all you have to do is ask (there's never been an extra charge). The wraps are also reasonably sized, but I think the best menu items are those over rice. The falafels can be a hit or miss. The last time I had it, it was hard to bite on and tasted strange (but it was probably a bad batch or something). \\n\\nThe Maaza mango juice is also really good (the bottle got a little bigger) and a friend of mine got lemonade which he said tasted really fresh and worth getting. \\n\\nThe restaurant expanded so you can actually eat there with a group of friends instead of having to walk all the way back to your apartment if you don't live close by. \\n\\nI know a lot of people compare this place to a similar one in NY, but I don't think it's fair to compare the two. I'm sure one might be better than the other, but I mean if you're in Austin this is the best place to go unless you plan on flying out of state for lunch."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"8285 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Oviedo","stars":"3","text":"We had a party of 7 (1/24/17).

When it came out it was not medium rare it was very rare. It had no flavor and it was mostly gristle. I got a deep dish pizza and it came out cold. The pan wasn't even hot at all.

I believe this zpizza location offers some of the most delicious and healthy pizza throughout all of Austin. As I tell everyone, zpizza is the only pizza I've ever enjoyed that I don't have to wipe any grease/oil off of my hands afterwards. It may seem like a small thing, but I'm no longer digesting those things to enjoy pizza. \\nHonestly, I no longer eat pizza anywhere else, because it's not as tasty and it certainly isn't as healthy. I haven't tried it yet, but everyone tells me their gluten free pizza is outstanding. BTW, their salads are huge and a great value and their gluten free deserts are pretty amazing - when they're not sold out due to their popularity. All in all if you want a spectacular pizza experience, you owe it to yourself, family & friends to switch to zpizza.

I had a house salad ($4) and tried all three of the dressings.  The house salad consisted of a spring mix, peeled and seeded cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, carrots and croutons.  It was typical a house salad.  The dressings are gluten free and are made in house.  So, there's the Cilantro Mango, Roasted Tomato & Red Wine Vinigrette, and the Citrus Honey.\\n\\nThe Crabby Steak ($24) is absolutely fantastic!  Flat iron steak, jumbo lump blue crab meat, topped with hollandaise.  Scalloped potatoes are underneath the proteins and grilled asparagus on the side.  The hollandaise here is on point! Lemony-buttery taste, beautiful color.  Needless to say, I devoured this dish.\\n\\nThe Fish Out Of Water ($23) is snapper, zucchini and squash, roasted beets, cherry tomatoes served on top of a farro and goat cheese salad.  Overall, the dish was enjoyable and tasted very light.\\n\\nThe Crabby Steak is a great entree but the Fish \\"Candy\\" ($24) is favorite!  The name is slightly off-putting but it is absolutely phenomenal.  Miso glazed snapper, sea salt caramel fusilli pasta, baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, and shiitake mushrooms in a brown butter sauce.  If you like Teriyaki sauce, you'll love the dish.  The sweetness of the fish, the savoriness of the pasta, the umami flavor from the shiitake mushrooms, it was great.  The pasta had an ever so slight chewiness but I didn't mind one bit.  So much tastiness going on with one dish, I was blown away.\\n\\nAt RusTeak, they have a daily trifle among their other desserts.  The trifle is a mason jar full of deliciousness and it changes day to day.  I had a Pi√±a Colada Trifle.  Pineapple jello made with club soda (so you get that extra bubbliness), layered with pound cake soaked in Malibu rum, coconut creme and topped with toasted coconut.  And trust me, it's as delicious as it sounds.\\n\\nSweet Potato Tots ($4), where have you been all this time?!  This is terribly addicting!  I am warning you all!  They are mini-sized tater tots that are amazing.  The sweet potato in these tots aren't too sweet, it's very well balanced.  It's served with a side of ketchup.  Just a little dab of ketchup or plain is great.\\n\\nThe NY Strip Steak ($24) is 10 ounces of NY Strip Steak, scallop potatoes, zucchini with a brandy glazed mushroom creamed sauce.  The sauces here are great!  My friend said he felt this dish was undervalued and would have easily paid $35 for entree.  I wholeheartedly agreed.\\n\\nI ordered the Pure Awesomeness ($18) with a name like that, I had to see for myself if it was indeed made of 'pure awesomeness.'  Sweet potato gnocchi, mozzarella morney, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, toasted sunflower seeds and with skewers of shrimp.  My verdict?  It was definitely different, an interesting dish but I found it far too sweet for my liking.  If you're a fan of walnut shrimp, then this would be a good dish for you.  The dish gets points from me for the originality.\\n\\nThe Shrimp Risotto ($18) came with blackened shrimp, risotto and saut√©ed broccolini.  Well seasoned entree, simple but tasty.  The Shrimp Risotto is a good and safe dish.\\n\\nThe Coconut Mango Mojito ($8) wasn't too minty and it was a nice refreshing beverage.  Bacardi Rum Coconut, mango schnapps, fresh squeezed limes, muddled mint.\\n\\n\\nI really enjoy the food and atmosphere at RusTeak.  The music here is mostly been alternative rock like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam.  Outdoor seating is available.  It's casual environment with top notch dishes and great drinks.

We'd initially tried to get a table at Miku but the wait was 1.5 hours so we decided to look elsewhere and came here because it had a solid 4 stars and looked great in the pictures. Sadly, we came away disappointed.\\n\\nAs a first impression, menus were tatty with a lot of items blacked out off the menu.\\n\\nAs a positive, the food was all round decent. We had mostly nigiri plus an appetizer and a roll off the specials menu. The unique seared sauce style in particular was good. None of the food we had was bad. As a comparison for us, it was all equivalent to a mid-tier sushi place in LA which is how I think it sits here too - nothing glamorous but nothing bad.\\n\\nUnfortunately we had a really negative experience with service, for ourselves and observing what had happened to others. Staff were very quick to seat us, but took too long to come back and take our order. We saw this happen with other parties too. Two other parties came in, were seated and the staff took so long that they walked out before ordering anything.\\n\\nAfter ordering, the food took a long time to come out, then nearly everything arrived at once. Considering the appetizer we ordered was just edamame, it seemed odd that that hadn't just come out sooner.\\n\\nWe were still hungry after our first round of food so we decided to order some more. It took forever to get their attention again (we should have learned!) but we ordered some more of the better nigiri and the roll special. These were good and didn't take too long to arrive, with the exception of one of the nigiri which we continued to wait for. And wait. And wait. We got the attention of one of the servers who informed us her colleague had never put the order in and that she would now.\\n\\nFor the entire duration of our meal we were sat next to a dirty table that a family had eaten at that was only being cleaned as we left.\\n\\nAs an additional observation, we saw multiple people come in to order take out. One customer was seated in the waiting area then they never returned to to take her order. She had to go and find the staff and we noticed she waited a solid half hour for her food. A second customer was still waiting by the time we left.\\n\\nAll in all this was a disappointing experience for our only dinner in Vancouver.

However, I hadn't ever tried a schnitzel until just this year.  When I heard about Seven Hens and their chicken schnitzel (German-style chicken cutlet) sandwiches, I was intrigued.  So when I saw that Groupon was offering a deal for two sandwich combos (with drinks and fries) for $15, I quickly purchased it.\\n\\nFast forward to my first visit...  It was a Saturday night, less than a week before the Groupon was going to expire.  (Yeah, I know - so last minute!)  However, it wasn't until the hubs and I had ordered and tried to pay with the Groupon - which was refused - that we realized the fine print stated we could only use it from Monday through Friday.  I was annoyed at myself for NOT reading the fine print (which I usually do!) and was about to pay full-price.  Luckily, our cashier was kind enough to give us a 10% discount.  Sweet!\\n\\nThe hubs and I ordered one Cajun BBQ (\\"American\\") schnitzel sandwich and one Curry Cucumber (\\"Indian\\") schnitzel wrap, and we both ate half of each.  We were each provided a tiny sample cup of house sauce to dip our fries in.  I'm a huge fan of sauces to dip fries in, and the hubs and I both loved the house sauce!\\n\\n| Cajun BBQ \\"American\\" |\\n\\nI'm a big fan of BBQ sauce, so it didn't take me very long to decide on ordering the \\"American\\" schnitzel on a baguette.  Per their menu description, the sandwich is made of a chicken schnitzel* topped with tomatoes and \\"Classic sweet and tangy BBQ sauce, southern-style coleslaw with medium heat Cajun seasoning.\\"  The flavors were spot on and the coleslaw was a tasty topping.  I don't even normally like coleslaw!  All in all, I loved every bite!\\n\\n| Curry Cucumber \\"Indian\\" |\\n\\nThe hubs ordered the \\"Indian\\" in a wrap which contained a chicken schnitzel* with tomatoes and \\"Crisp cucumber salad, curried yogurt dressing with a flavorful Garam Masala seasoning.\\"  The Garam Masala spices were flavorful and we could really taste the \\"Indian\\" influence, but the chicken was saltier than we would have preferred.  We still enjoyed it, though!\\n\\n* Note: You can also have your schnitzel grilled or exchanged for fresh grilled tofu instead for no extra charge.\\n\\nSince we still needed to use the Groupon I had purchased, we returned for our second visit a few days later.  This time, we ordered the \\"American\\" schnitzel sandwich and the Ginger Teriyaki (\\"Chinese\\") schnitzel wrap.  When we received our sandwiches and tasted the \\"Chinese\\" schnitzel wrap for the first time, I realized that it tasted exactly like the Indian - with the strong flavor of the Garam Masala spices.  I was absolutely certain it was not the \\"Chinese\\" schnitzel since it did not contain any traces of the \\"gingery Chinese mayo and sweet teriyaki glaze with Chinese 10 spice.\\"  However, the manager (who made the wrap himself) insisted it was the \\"Chinese\\" and definitely not the \\"Indian.\\"  After a brief exchange with the manager, the hubs decided we should just eat it and not make a big deal about it.\\n\\nBoth visits, the chicken schnitzels in our sandwiches and wraps were perfectly cooked - juicy and just the right thickness.  We were really impressed by the consistency of the cook both times - even though different employees cooked them.  \\n\\nHowever, the following things irked us:\\n\\n1) Their sign outside was not lit up both times we visited.

I informed the manager during the second visit, and he thanked me, saying he did not know the sign wasn't lit.  Hopefully it is now!\\n2) Their fountain drink lids did not fit on the cups they had.  I guess they had ordered the wrong ones?  Not a big deal, but kind of strange.\\n3) The manager insisted he was right about the schnitzel wrap he made when it clearly wasn't the one we had ordered.\\n\\nOverall, Seven Hens in Decatur gets 4 stars for their delicious, creative, and fresh chicken schnitzel sandwiches!  The employees were friendly during both visits - even the manager who thought he made the wrap that we had ordered was polite as he stood his ground.  Price-wise, I would have to agree with other Yelpers that the regular price - about $10 for a sandwich, fries, and drink combo - is a bit steeper than you would expect from a \\"fast casual\\" restaurant like Seven Hens.  However, I do feel that the quality and taste of the ingredients that go into the sandwich are worth the price.  The hubs and I are officially fans of Seven Hens and will definitely be back!

Now that I know, I will easily be able to choose the right doughnut for me, since Revolution separates them on the menu! Love that! \\n\\nWe went on a weekend in the mid-afternoon and had no trouble getting a parking spot. The line was short and we had doughnuts and coffee in hand in no time at all.

This was pain. This was suffering. I left the room nearly every time the PA was cranked.\\n\\nNow, lest there be any mistake, I like loud music. I'm under 30. I've seen Godspeed, I've seen Dick Dale, I've seen Mogwai, Man or Astro-man?, Daikaiju, I've seen the majority of the post-rock bands that operate in Atlanta and the surrounding area. I shoot guns. People shout at me to turn the stereo down when they ride in my automobile. I am accustomed to high sound pressure levels. \\n\\nI do not mean this hyperbolically: Imperial Fez is too loud.\\n\\nA loud concert is a different kind of noise than that to which Imperial Fez subjects its diners. Concert venues usually have fewer parallel walls than the Fez dining room. Parallel walls are bad for acoustics, and the Fez dining room consists entirely of parallel walls.\\n\\nImagine a large rectangular pan filled halfway with water. You take one finger on your left hand and one on your right. You quickly plunge them at the same time to the bottom of the pan, right near one edge. Observe as two sets of concentric rings flow outward. See how sometimes those rings intersect? Those peaks are higher than those of either of the waves that intersected. See also when the dips between rings intersect, and those dips are lower than the waves that joined to create them? This phenomenon is called \\"constructive interference\\" and the uneven grid of hot and cold spots that forms inside a rectangular echo chamber is the reason professionals design concert halls to be shaped as little like the Fez dining room as possible. \\n\\nSo, you thought it wasn't that loud. You were sitting in a cold spot. I was not that lucky. My ears are ringing from only about a 25% exposure to the Fez's evening audio program.\\n\\nBecause... not to be deterred by the lack of deafening pain in the cold spots of the room, the operators of the Fez PA system run it at maximum output level. Actually, they run it beyond maximum output level -- if you cram your fingers into your ears as hard as you can while the noise is blaring, you can hear some details of the signal, and make out crackling and popping that should not be in the output. It was a little difficult for me to tell the cause, but it was either the power amplifier shutting itself down as a fire precaution, or it was the loudspeaker cones reaching their limit of travel.\\n\\nImperial Fez is too loud.

Steak was cooked to perfection, the jalape√±o butter was plopped right in the middle and soaked into the cornmeal pancake giving me saturated bites and it was fabulous.

You shouldn't be allowed to sandwich people between where waiters pick up drink orders and where others defecate. Especially if you expect those paying customers to eat your food. Disgusting. I was so disturbed that we asked to move as soon as other seats further down the bar opened up. Thankfully, we were granted our wish. Because if that wasn't the case and if this place hadn't received such good reviews, I'd have walked out and spent money elsewhere.\\n\\nOn to the food and drink.... Woefully, this place is beer and wine only. The bartender offered to make me a bellini, which was cool. He offered me a few juice choices and I chose passionfruit. It was extremely sour, to the point of needing a water chaser after every sip. Sadly, it was expensive as well.\\n\\nOrdered the hot buttered lobster roll. Good, but not any different from steaming a lobster at home and then putting its meat in a roll and drizzling melted butter on it.\\n\\nFine. But what a pain it was to pay.

You go here for the pho, NOT the ambiance or service. NYE with a party of 3, we were seated immediately, to our delight. The seating arrangement is set up to seat as many people in a medium sized area as possible. (If you're looking for cozy--yup its your place. Intimate gossip--not unless you want to be overhead by everyone). After sitting for 3 minutes a gentleman (I think was the waiter but he didn't introduce himself) came to our table and took our orders. Our food came up surprisingly quick--in less than 10 minutes. We were never checked on while eating our meal and it took considerable effort to call aside our waiter for waters and a drink order. I'm a girl that likes to take her time and enjoy the food. I felt like the entire experience was rushed and all about \\"get as many people in, dine as quick as you can, and please leave so we can have the table.\\" And I'm realistic here. It was NYE. There are hundreds of people out. Huge business opportunity. I wasn't expecting a 5 star black tie waitstaff, decadence, and wine goblets but I wanted to at least feel like I was an appreciated customer!\\n\\nFood: Two members of our party ordered the beef noodle soup. I ordered the thin bean noodles. Both entrees were delicious and filling. Pho Pasteur is known for their generous portion sizes and generous they were. My dish, the thin bean noddles, could have easily fed my family of four!\\n\\nParking: Walking distance from Park Street, Chinatown, Downtown Crossing MBTA stops.\\n\\nRecap--go for the food not for the dining experience.

Even if the food is ok and the service is wonderful, I will be back and give it another try, but awful service.....it completely turns me off.  \\n\\nAnyways, walked around, drank, drank some more, ate some snacks and before we knew it, we got a call around 2pm.  Started off with some Bloodys, great taste, bad vegetables on top.  I know, I know, it's vegetables.  I actually look forward to the vegetables, but it tastes like they pickle everything together and I was not a fan of the taste.  \\n\\nFor the food - started off with the biscuits and venison gravy....wow.  One of the best breakfast items I've ever had! Sooooo \\"tasty\\" wow, my mouth waters just thinking about those biscuits and gravy.  Now for our main course, I'm not lying, we looked over the menu for over 30 minutes lol everything sounded and looked delicious, after much contemplation we went with the...Duck...Duck....Steak!   Allen Brothers Angus teres major. potatoes confit in duck fat. onion sour cream. sunny duck egg*  \\nsounds bomb right?  It was just okay.... I had some high hopes and expectations for this meal, and it just didn't do it for me.  The potatoes were coated in a spicy coating, too much, and it was so over powering.  The meat was pretty good and the egg was ok.   \\n\\nOur server was great! She was friendly and checked in often.  When I come back to Portland, I would definitely like to come back for dinner and I hear they have a great Happy Hour.

I tried. Dammit, I tried to like this place. But I'm tapping out. No more, I say!\\n\\nA couple of years ago, when I was working for a certain company, they would order cakes from Flour (another location) for birthdays and special occasions. It was a couple of years ago, so I can't remember all the flavors I tried. But I do remember the cakes having \\"interesting\\" tastes and textures. And by \\"interesting\\" I mean, \\"What the f-...what is this?!\\" I promise you, the frosting tasted like unsalted butter with sugar in it. And the cake tasted like it was too dry so they dumped some simple syrup over it hoping that it would sink in.\\n\\nWell, this time around, I gave the place a second chance, because I thought that maybe things have changed since I last tried their baked goods two years ago. I admit, the place is rather tempting with their baked goods on display. I wandered in to try their brownies, but I spotted a lone chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting. I stood in line and ordered it to the disappointment of about 3 people who were standing in line for the same thing. I realize in hindsight that I should have let them have it!\\n\\nI also ordered a raspberry lemon cake. It had a sign in front with a cost of $1.25. I got in line and realized that it was actually $5-something, and that the lone sign was actually for the mini tarts. Were they trying to hide the price on purpose and wait for you to get your goods all boxed up and ready to be paid for? I don't know, shame on me maybe for not double-checking.\\n\\nAnyway, I got home and immediately started in on the cupcake. While the flavor was okay, the texture was not that great. The cake was too crumby. There was some moisture, but by the end of the cupcake, there were crumbs everywhere. I figure a good chocolate cupcake would be too moist to fall apart like that. And the frosting tasted like a combination of traditional icing, marshmallow icing, and butter-cream all rolled together. And my mouth got confused. I finished it, because I needed my chocolate fix, and I didn't want to waste $3.25, but it definitely felt forced.\\n\\nThe lemon raspberry cake was this cute little, round, layered lemon sponge cake with raspberry jam, lemon curd, and some kind of cream. It looked good. It had good flavors, but again...that texture. That damn texture. It tasted so tough. WHY?! What are they trying to prove here? Are they trying to make sure the cakes don't sink onto themselves or fall over?! What is it?! I don't know, I just know I'll never do it again. No, thank you!"},{"name":"Sa Bai Thai Cuisine","address":"4440 NE 131st Pl","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We were nearby doing a Costco run and saw these folks had five stars.

The menu has plenty of appetizing selections, but they just don't deliver on flavor. I had the steak dip sandwich which was tender but bland, and the roll far too thick.

My latest (and, I'm certain, final) visit to American Craft was an absolute nightmare.  After arriving around 8:30 on a weeknight, I was told the wait would be about half an hour--not bad, so I decided to wait. Unfortunately, it took the bartender 20 minutes to acknowledge my existence (though the bar wasn't very busy, and he managed to--slowly--serve others who had shown up after me), at which point he gave me a beer list but no wine or food lists, which I had to specifically ask for another 10 minutes later.

Two seats down from us at the bar, though, a young woman vomited onto the bar...and the bartender didn't even notice! We had to inform the manager of the incident (and the bathroom vomit), and his reaction--other than a contrite apology--was to smile and laugh, before wiping the area down (barely) and walking away.  At this point, I didn't feel much like remaining at the bar, so I asked the manager how much longer our wait would be, or whether we could wait at one of the empty tables to be served (since we were \\"next\\" on the list and preferred not to eat or drink in a pool of vomit).

So I stopped at Manuel's. Been there before and had really good fajitas and good margaritas.\\n\\nOn this occasion I decided I should try something else, so I had a glass of pinot grigio, which was okay, and I ordered the camarones a la plancha, described on the menu as shrimps accented with orange and lime and cilantro, on a bed of rice.\\n\\nThe presentation was attractive, the problem was that nothing was accented with anything else. What I got were some large shrimps on a bed of rice surrounded by a couple of small slices of orange and limes, and I do mean small, barely worth squeezing. More decorative than savory.\\n\\nService was prompt, cheerful and fast. But I left $38 lighter and pretty disappointed. Next time I'll go back to the fajitas and margaritas, which are worth at least one more star."},{"name":"Caf√© Luxy","address":"1235 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Ordered take away from this establishment and it took over an hour and a half to get to us, we live less then 5 minutes from here, delivery person didn't apologize for how late it was.

So we contacted the manager and they offered to have us back in order to repair the experience we had. The manager on duty, Rob and the waiters who assisted us (Louis and Galo) were excellent. They were super attentive and so welcoming to our party of 10. All of our drink, appetizers, and entrees came out accordingly. This was truly a 180 degree turn around and was SO delicious.

I can admit I was totally wrong to pre-judge. I had the green chile since everyone raves about it. The green chile is supposedly 10 on the heat scale. I did not believe, but after having it, um, yeah HOT!!!! Not inedible hot, but enough to make you sweat. You can get it in a bowl, but they also use it in burritos and for the huevos rancheros, which is the other way I tried it. \\n\\nPro tips: get there before noon or after 1.30 to miss the lunch crowd. You're pretty much going to wait for dinner, but they do take out, if you are impatient.

He said \\"I am the Phi part owner!\\" HA! So we chatted about Philly and how they ship their Amoroso rolls in from the north and this made me giddy with excitement as I think Northern bread and rolls are greater than almost anything. At the end of our meal he even brought me over a fresh salt water taffy from the Jersey Shore... excellent customer connecting there. When we were leaving a huge shipment was coming in and the Amoroso boxes strolled through and he was so excited to show me, haha I love it! \\n\\nIf ya'll know me at all you know I love me a good Cheese Steak! So I had to try this spot out immediately upon hearing about it. SO I am  #TeamPhi allll the way! The meat was well seasoned but it could have been more \\"minced\\" for my liking but it seems they went the Pat's/Geno's way of presentation and prep. I dig it but I am more of a Jim's fine diced! The roll, perfection! However, I should know to order double meat when not physically in Philly but I didn't the first time so moving forward, I know that if I want mine overflowing, double it up! Or here they say \\"Twice the Philly!\\" I also go provolone but they do have the wizzzz.\\n\\nAlso had half of Roast Pork sammie too - cause you can get 1/2 and 1/2 combos... brilliant! But it was a little too fatty and spicy for me. That's okay, I will stick with the Phi side with each trip from now on.

But we had high hopes for this place when it opened up - a clean, open, large space to watch sports, drink beer, and eat decent food.\\n\\nToo bad the majority of the TVs were playing the same channel. So what if it's lunchtime on a Friday? I don't want to turn my head 180 degrees and still be watching an old Sox game on ESPN. I'm sure a soccer game was playing on another channel. \\n\\nToo bad the beer selection was average. I would have expected some craft beers to be available on tap. The option to order beer by the pitcher is a nice touch, but the length of time it took for our waitress to return with a refill totally killed my buzz.\\n\\nToo bad the food was subpar. I'm glad we got the tower of bone-in wings, but I expected the level of hot to be much higher when I requested the sauces to be spicy. The lunch portion of salmon I ordered was flavorless and dry; I had to ask for a side of honey mustard to be able to eat it. The rice pilaf and grilled asparagus sides were nothing special - the pilaf tasted like it has been under a heat lamp for a few hours and the asparagus was soggy and overdone. The grilled chicken sandwich was overdone as well - rubbery and dry to taste. At least the sweet potato fries weren't burnt.\\n\\nWill we be back? Probably not.

Loved the philly finger rolls - I think they were hand made there and not just pulled out  of a freezer bag like most places.  Also liked the pretzels and cheese dip.  Burgers are good as well.\\n\\nAs far as negatives - The music selection was atrocious.  At one point they played the theme song from Deliverance followed by \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" from The Wall.  Didn't really bring the level of energy up in the place. Everyone just sort of stared into their drinks waiting for the misery to end.  Footloose followed Pink Floyd and I don't think I've seen a group of people so happy to hear Kenny Loggins.\\n\\nAlso - the service wasn't too hot.  It took our waitress 20 minutes to bring us our first round of drinks and when she finally got there she brought us the wrong order.  \\n\\nOverall, an above average bar/restaurant with some flaws that didn't ruin the experience but that could certainly be worked on."},{"name":"Pepino's Mexican Grill - Portland","address":"3832 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I always get the sweet tequila tofu burrito--so good!

I would have bolted after drink #1 it was so uncomfortable, humid, and crowded, but we were waiting on friends to arrive so I had to stick it out.  It's 85 degrees out guys. Kick on the A/C. \\n\\nThe second star is credited solely to the bartenders, who were exceptionally friendly, gracious, and attentive considering how busy they were.  However, I can't remember the last bar I went to that measured their mixed drinks using a single shot. I mean, seriously??? Over the course of 2 hours, and $105 later, my girlfriend and I left with nary a buzz. Absolutely unacceptable. I'm not looking to get hammered and rowdy by any means, but at fifty bucks a head I should be feeling pretty good, and all I felt was a sweaty mess. \\n\\nClearly this is a business that puts tight restrictions on their bartenders in an effort to maximize a buck, and I felt bad that I couldn't justify tipping them more for their kindness once receiving the shocking bill.

Since I wasn't THAT hungry, I opted to get just 1 donut and the fact that the donuts are $2...I couldn't see getting more than one of this visit. I ordered the Yeast Vanilla Glazed Donut to go.

That said, avoid this restaurant like the plague. The salad buffet was half empty for the 2 hours I was there. There was plenty of steak but it was all over cooked and very bland tasting. Not Brazilian...I promise.  When one in my party asked for a basket of friend bananas the waiter acted as if we had just insulted his mother. He returned 40 min later with said bananas.  It took 30 minutes just to get our drinks (water by the way). The service was really bad.  Then to top all of this off, even though we were told by the hostess and the waiter that they would validate our parking, at the end of the meal the the waiter told us to just tell the parking attendant we had been there and it would be fine. \\"People do it all the time\\" he said. He lied. On top of the overpriced meal we had we also had to pay $20 for parking in Downtown Atlanta.  I will absolutely never return to Fire of Brazil.
