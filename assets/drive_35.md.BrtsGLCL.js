We started off with four oysters which were excellent and an order of ceviche. The ceviche left a lot to be desired. It was small and served with chips that resembled the fried greasy crackers that come with Chinese takeout egg drop soup. We expected the ceviche to at least resemble the cold seafood soup that we enjoyed so much while living in Ecuador, but it had a strong odor and was more like a cold seafood salad, leaving a lot to be desired. \\n\\nWe shared a burger which was pretty plain, but I suppose that's to be expected at a primarily seafood restaurant. \\n\\nI really could have seen past our mediocre culinary experience what with the beautiful view of the city skyline and the breeze coming off the harbor had Monica not engaged in our conversation in the way that she did. It seems that we have differing views on Colombian politics, which is fine. I can tell you though, as a person who works in the food industry myself, that it's best not to engage with a customer if you feel that engaging could begin an argument. Monica did engage, however, and turned what could have been a light conversation into a disgusting display of her own ignorance. Despite our efforts to find a common ground or change the subject, Monica insulted me several times even going so far as to say \\"You as an American have no right to have an opinion.\\"\\n\\nAfter her rampage of insults towards me, we asked for the check.

I want to say the menu stated they cook the patties to medium / medium rare but they seemed to take some leeway with that on mine. A good steak is one thing, but a burger needs to be cooked at least a little bit. This thing was a gooey pink mess with a tiny cooked outer crust. It was definitely the reason the bun was so soggy and I just couldn't get past the texture.

Definitely call ahead for reservations!! \\n\\nService: I thought everybody was very friendly: from the guy who greeted me at the door, to my two servers, to the guy who refilled my water glass. It was very busy but the staff did their best to be attentive and helpful.  My table wasn't quite ready when I arrived, waited maybe 15min or so, but it wasn't a big deal. \\n\\nAmbiance: I sat at one of the high tables near the bar area.  On a Saturday night, this place was quite the scene.  The bar was pretty crowded and so it was pretty loud near our table.  The restaurant sort of has three sections, and the bar is in the middle.  I think if you're seated in one of the side dining areas it would be a different experience from sitting near the bar.  People were generally well dressed and just having a good time.\\n\\nFood: My friend and I ordered 6 tapas, 1 drink and 1 dessert.  The beef empanada was my favorite.  It's really flavorful and is served with this awesome spicy, tangy red sauce.  We also had the whipped sheep's cheese, which was served with toasted bread and I enjoyed it but my friend found it a little bland.  He preferred the goat cheese served with the mushrooms.  The gambas al ajillo were pretty good, but I prefer the ones at Tasca.  These were larger, which I liked, but the flavors were less bold.  I wish we had skipped the yellowfin tuna crudo; it wasn't bad by any means, but it just didn't stand out.  Next time I'll order the Patatas Bravas and Sirloin because I've heard good things about them.  Also, their bread is awesome. I could eat like 3 baskets of that stuff haha\\n\\nDessert/ Drinks:  I had the Summer St. Sling (chamomile infused vodka w/ grapefurit and lemon juice) which I was a big fan of.  The chamomile flavor was awesome, something I'm used to in tea not cocktails, but it worked!  The crepas were better than I remembered.

I will say though it is a tasty burger when I was able to de grease it a bit. Now the fries.... oh the fries.. maybe it was the night time or the hour.. but they were horrible. Hard, more burnt then potato and over all not good. Because the Buzz Mill was so busy and they had to remake my burger the first time I didn't want to complain.

This meal just hit the spot for me on a cold winter night.  The moment I went inside, I was taken by the warm, aromatic smell of spices. The decor of the place was quite modern, but not cold. Ambiance was very welcoming. We decided on the chef's tasting menu, and started with a cocktail. They have a surprisingly modern and delicious selection of cocktails - flavorful, refreshing, and masterfully mixed (huge props to the cute bartender lady). Flavors were well balanced with each of the drinks we ordered. For example, my friend ordered a drink with whiskey. I'm usually very turned off by the smell of whisky, but this drink brought out the subtle sweetness of  the liquor, and made its scent not only acceptable, but delectable! \\n\\nThe chef's menu had 5 courses: a soup, mussels, pork belly, curry, and salad. The hot sour soup was hearty and substantial with mushrooms and sable fish, which was cooked to buttery smooth perfection. The mussels were plump, fresh, and juicy, steamed in an turmeric broth. Be careful not to eat the chilli peppers! They are extremely hot - one touch on my lips and they were burning for good 10 min. Pork belly was sweet and gooey, a nice change in pace to the meal that cools down the palate. I think the perfect pork belly should either be crunchy and crispy, or melt in your mouth. This was the latter. I even did a little happy dance in my chair when I tasted it! The squid salad was refreshing with a vinegar-like dressing, and the squid was cooked to just al dente. The beef curry was served with jasmine rice. It was surprisingly sweet, but not in an overpowering kinda way. The beef chunks were not as tender as I hoped, but I still liked this dish a lot. \\n\\nThat meal just hit the spot. But even so, we had room for dessert: banana roti. Both my dining partner and I have a unhealthy obsession with roti, and this did not disappoint.  Crispy, tender roti wrapped around a thin layer of banana, topped with sweet turmeric syrup.

I loved my chicken fried steak and thought the gravy was nicely seasoned not bland.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon was delicious.  The toast had real butter on it - not dry with a side packet of some sort of margarine like the chains often do.  My friend did get the coffee and said it was awful, but my Coke was fine (hard to screw that up).\\n\\nSo all in all a mixed review for Ron's.  I agree with some of the other posters here that cleanliness is a problem.  They should close a day for a thorough cleaning and painting.  A \\"greasy spoon\\" should be more a nostalgic term of endearment rather than a literal descriptor.

That said, no changes can be made to their creations. But trust me, you don't want to. \\n\\nI love Parish because you can sample the cuisine of the best restaurants all over the city in a chill atmosphere for little money. The menu also changes seasonally so there's always something different (don't worry, old favorites are put into the specials rotation).\\n\\nThere's the SDLT from Geoff Gardner of Sel De La Terre, an amazing smoked duck BLT with applewood bacon and caper mayo on rye. Or you have Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich courtesy of Rowdy Bessey from Flash's, the crispiest, least greasy but moist breaded baked chicken with melted swiss and cheddar, chipotle mayo, bacon lettuce and tomato on a roll. And 10 others.\\n\\nThere's also a sandwich created by chef of Parish Cafe, Sean Simmons. The Chipotle Meatloaf Club embodies all the familiarity of mom's version but with a punch of smoky heat. Served on white with melted Jack cheese and chipotle mayo, it's the perfect blend of Southwest flavor with pure Americana. And of course there's the mandatory side of mashed potatoes, which are nothing special, with a beef gravy that's reminiscent of that powdered stuff from a packet. Trade them in for the potato salad (it's some of the best I've ever tasted), and you've got a winner. \\n\\nParish also has a great selection of wine & beer, as well as some fun martinis.

On the first visit, we both ordered the bento box (hey, girls like that sort of thing). I got the spicy beer stewed chicken and it was rock solid comfort food - very tasty indeed. My friend got the Rocky Shrimp and said it was OK but not really up to expectations. The rest of the box (salad, miso soup, rice, traditional sushi roll) was serviceable but nothing to write home about - there are much, much better places to get sushi in this town.\\n\\nToday, we opted for the hand-pulled dry noodles and wow. They were awesome! My friend got the thick spaghetti Xian noodles with beef and I got the stir-fried pappardelle-style noodles with tofu. I would tell you what my friend's dish tasted like but I only got a bite and I was completely captivated by my dish -  slightly smoky wide noodles a mile long, cooked al dente then stir-fried with leeks, onions, bell peppers, bok choy, egg, and a very nice lightly fried tofu in a silky sauce.  A drizzle of chili oil was a very nice touch.  Very satisfying!\\n\\nService is friendly and very helpful (our waitress helped us choose the noodles and we were pleased with her recommendations) although the wait for the check has been a bit long on both visits. The interior is pleasant enough with wood accents, knick-knacks and wall murals of cherry blossoms and outdoor cafes; it's not too noisy and the tall-backed booths keep conversations private. If you can't tear yourself away from ESPN Sportscenter, you'll be happy to find a wide screen TV in the main dining room running it constantly (no sound). The kitchen is open enough that you can watch the noodles being pulled by hand. There's a small sushi bar and apparently an oyster bar in the far back (though I've never walked all the way back there). There are even a few small tables with umbrellas on the sidewalk outside but I can't comment on the service there.\\n\\nBased on others' reviews I hope to try the pork buns next time.

I was blown away by tonight's meal at The Cowfish. My wife and I came in as a guest of the Director of Guest Experience due to a previously poor visit. We wanted to give The Cowfish a second chance and I am so glad we did!\\n\\nThe food was incredible which is surprising when you see this is a sushi bar/gourmet burger mashup restaurant. I'm happy to report that this place nails the concept. \\n\\nThe vibe is very fun, young, and modern. The art on the walls is very fresh pop art takes on classic images from pop culture and art history with a Cowfish theme. The center piece of the restaurant is the incredible bar backed by a beautiful tropical fish tank. It's an environment that puts you at ease and make you happy. \\n\\nThe place was packed at 7:00pm on a Thursday which should tell you that something is being done right here. We were seated promptly with Allison as our server. An absolute delight and consummate professional she made the experience really easy and a major step up from last time. We decided to forgo an appetizer in favor of drinks and dinner. I ordered a solid porter while my wife had one of the most well balanced cocktails I've ever experienced. For food I opted for the Arnold Hamandeggar: a half pound beef patty with grilled onions that melt in your mouth, cheddar cheese, crispy thick cut bacon, fried ham, and a fried egg on the best onion roll I've ever had. Cooked medium well it came out and was spot on. Intimidating on the plate I cut mine in half and powered through enjoying every bite. My wife went for one of the incredibly inventive bento boxes with a slider, four pieces of sushi, cucumber salad, edamame, and perfect sweet potato fries. Yet again, mind blown. The slider was a Jammin' the Blues burger that packed so much rich decadence into a tiny package that I was in shock. Everything worked so well together in the little box. After that it was time for dessert. Milkshakes called to us and I went with the Grasshopper (vanilla bean ice cream blended with Andes Mints) and my wife had the Caramel Chocolate Espresso Malt shake. Ever had a caramel macchiato from Starbucks? Like that, but so much better. It tastes like the most perfect frozen coffee. It was a brilliant cap to a very fun experience. \\n\\nCost wise The Cowfish fits right in with everything else you find around Perimeter in the $11-$30 range. The nice thing is you get what you pay for! Portions are generous without being excessive. The cocktails run about $12 but it really is worth the price. They did their homework and should be very proud of the results. My burger ran $15, the bento box $16, and the shakes $6.50 each. I've been other places and paid more for less bad food than here. I plan on returning and making The Cowfish a special stop. It is a unique experience and the ultimate mediator for the dinner decision dance we all do. \\n\\nA special thanks to Morgan, John, and Allison for such an incredible dining experience.

The waffles reminded me of the time I ate waffles in Belgium (not the one with the sugar in the middle). I wished we ordered more waffles with more sauces but we also ordered 2 entrees and didn't want to take any leftovers. I also ordered the mocha and it was a dark chocolate so on the bitter side. It was okay but I wished I ordered a cocktail after seeing the bartender whip up so many different ones.\\n\\nThe bartender recommended a few dishes and we decided to go based on his suggestions. My boyfriend got the Harissa \\"Burger\\" which we were warned it isn't a traditional burger.My boyfiend absolutely loved his dish. It was like a layered dish with pita, hummus, beef, and other toppings. \\n\\nI ordered the short ribs egg dish, the Fricassee (I had to look it up). My dish was served in a cast iron skillet and reminded me of a shakshuka but with short rib. It was full of flavor and tasty really hearty with the tomato flavor.

We got 5 pork spare ribs, 3 beef ribs, maybe half a pound of brisket as well. There was five of us and we had difficulty finishing everything. We overestimated ourselves, I suppose.

It's pretty similar to what you can find in Lockhart which is the highest of compliments.

Only reason I would not say 5 stars is that my wife came here for the Chicken Tikka, and it was ok, but a little disappointing.

And this is a BIG but, not unlike the state mine will be in soon, after eating these Blue Star gems. These doughnuts, you just have to try them. I ordered the peanut butter powder with marionberry jam, the OG, and the blueberry basil bourbon. (Wanted to try the crime br√ªl√©e, but it wasn't out yet when I went first thing in the AM). I shocked myself because I thought I'd just have a bite or two of each, but I finished two whole doughnuts! They were not too sweet at all, and not greasy at all, but they ALSO were not dry at all. I loved the OG, probably the best doughnut I've ever had. It had just a touch of cinnamon I think in the glaze. Damn it was perfect; really just the classic done right. The pb/marionberry was so SMART. Using peanut butter powder on the outside; genius. You get the pb flavor, but it isn't too sweet at all. I still can't believe I ate two whole doughnuts, when I usually can't even finish one! I didn't love the blueberry basil bourbon, not because there was anything wrong with it, I just realized that I don't want my doughnut to taste like any of those things.\\n\\nOne tiny thing that needs to be addressed is the coffee situation. It's weird to only have one size cup of coffee, and that it be very small small. It's just weird. It was also weird that I asked for a large, and then the cashier just handed me a tiny cup, saying nothing. I paid before I realized it, but I probably would have bought two or gone elsewhere, because 8 oz is not enough coffee for anything. Also, a little off putting, there were tiny fruit flies swarming around the creamer. I've worked in the food industry and I know it's hard to avoid this, but you've gotta do it.

The guacamole is perfectly seasoned and tastes very refreshing. The ribeye seemed to be on the salty side for my liking but I think it might be perfectly seasoned for others. The pork belly taco was delicious and literally melts in your mouth! Also, the tacos are smaller than what others might be used to at like Tin Lizzys or other taco places. However, the quality is definitely worth the price and there's a great lunch special for $10. My coworker absolutely loved her shrimp rice bowl. I will definitely be back to eat more tacos!\\n\\nService - Since we came during the lunch rush, food and drinks came out a bit slow, but that's understandable considering how packed they were. Our server was great and friendly. Also, there was a mixup with the To-go order but the manager quickly fixed it and even gave us the wrong order to take home to try!

The only reason I came to this restaurant is because my sister suggested it and we have very different tastes. This restaurant may be a hidden gem for fans of Middle Eastern food.\\n\\nThe Food\\nQuite a bit of variety in terms of meat, which you can order on either rice or a wrap. I had the beef shawarma over rice. Now, as someone who almost never eats Middle Eastern food, this was too much for me. The meat was marinated in some unfamiliar spices and the whole thing was slathered in white sauce. The sauce overpowered the meal and it was pretty much all I could taste. Apparantly, the falafels are great if you are vegetarian. I could tell that the food was authentic, but it isn't necessarily high quality.\\n\\nThe Price\\nThis is probably where the restaurant excels. They give you generous portions for a low price. Ideal for college students.\\n\\nThe Restaurant\\nI really can't find anything good to say about this place. The location isn't exactly appealing since it is rather far from populated areas compared to other restaurants. The interior of the restaurant is quite messy and poorly designed. During my meal, I had to constantly shoo flies away from my food. The seats and tables are cramped and made out of low quality material. The restaurant itself just seems incomplete in a sense. I have personally never used the take-out, but it seems convenient, especially with the aluminum food containers. Semi-populated during lunch time with mostly college students. I didn't have a problem with the cashiers. \\n\\nOverall\\nIf you enjoy Middle Eastern food, definitely try this place out and judge for yourself.

If you are not familiar with Joe's sauce, it is a delicious mustard based sauce that is the traditional way to serve stone claws now. The claw was of good size, clearly never frozen, and cracked nicely. Delicious as fresh stone claws always are when served with a good Joe's sauce. \\n\\nWe also ordered the lobster morsels. Omg were those good. Similar to the ones served at sister restaurant, Chops.  They were simply amazing. Don't skip them. \\n\\nWe then had the romaine salad.

Did they not realize the bar was also very crowded?  \\nThis would have been forgivable if the food were amazing, but actually the red sangria is the best thing we had that night. The pitcher was definitely worth the $24 we paid, and it was interesting because it had pineapple juice. My other favorite thing was the complimentary bread (served warm!) with olive oil.\\nWe also tried one of the pork charcuterie, which was good but such a small portion for the price. The whipped cheese was a large portion but the bread that came with it was burnt, not charred. I enjoyed the sauce in the chorizo with fig dish, but the sausage was a little tough. Butternut squash was solid, but nothing to write home about. John Dory was my favorite dish of the night but he was not impressed. \\nMy guy and I were sitting against the wall, and he said our server (Michael) spit on him every time he came over the talk to us. -___- Speaking of service, it was really slow and inattentive.

Round almost meatball style pork, clean crisp lettuce, some herbs (cilantro? mint?) and an awesome dipping sauce!\\n-Mama Chang's Dumplings\\n     -These were very good, not frozen, but they didn't knock my socks off.  Better than typical Chinese food, but not that \\"WOW! these are handmade and I cant eat enough of them\\" feeling.\\n-Hot and Sour soup\\n     -BEST I'VE EVER HAD!!!!  Great soup, tons of fresh flavorful ingredients, spicy, and did I mention it was good?\\n-Genmai fried rice\\n     -Great rice.  Short grain brown rice, lots of fresh mix ins, and tons of flavor.  Fried egg come ON TOP, not mixed in as traditionally served\\n-Surf and Turf black pepper Shangai noodles\\n     -Lots of spice, TONS of black pepper, and some good herbs.  Noodles were delicious, and not over cooked.  There were only 2 shrimp, and a few small strips of steak.  I was a little let down with the amount of meat/fish in the dish.\\n-Organic red miso glazed carrots\\n     -Wanted so badly to love these, they had a lot of flavor.  Unfortunately a lot of them were burned, and the entire dish was so under cooked that we couldn't cut them with a fork.  :(\\n\\nHad 2 beers while there:\\n     -Lagunitas little sumpin' sumpin'.......great beer, lots of hops, and 7.5%.  Awesome beer to sip.\\n     -Hatachino Nest White Ale.......my favorite white beer now.  Its a Japanese brew with a lot of flavor and a light, crisp, refreshing, flavor.\\n\\n\\nAll in all it was great food and service.

Ramen Ryoma is definitely a hidden gem! My daughter and I couldn't decide between Thai and Ramen...I'm so glad we decided on Ramen. Ramen Ryoma is located next to an Asian market, lucky for me I had seen the market earlier that day when I end up at the credit union in same area. So when I realized where this ramen spot was I knew exactly where to go. From the outside it doesn't look like your typical restaurant, but when we got to the front we were able to tell that didn't matter cuz this joint was packed! I asked wait time and young lady said 30 minutes. My daughter and I were really hungry but I talked her into waiting by kinda playing a Jedi mind trick on her...I told her by time we went someplace else it'd be more than 30 minutes. So she agreed to wait it out, and boy was she glad we did. While waiting we looked around inside the market, then passed time by looking at the menu so we'd know what we wanted by the time we sat down to order. \\n\\nI got the killer spicy with corn and my daughter got the spicy. I've been to many ramen places and the most spicy on the menu is no where near spicy, let alone killer spicy. Well Ramen Ryoma delivered on what they said...the killer spicy was HELLA SPICY! I let my daughter try and she was disappointed she only got the spicy. The slice of pork was the best I've had from any of the places I've been before. It was so tender and flavorful. This is in top two of ramen places I've been. \\n\\nNext time I go I will get the spicy, so I can enjoy even more.

The host was sitting at a table nearby using his laptop.  Once we were seated, it took the waitress forever to acknowledge us, forever to bring us one drink, but she forgot my hsuband's, so another forever to get his.  When he wanted another, he just walked up to the bar rather than wait.  She forgot to bring my salad, so she brought it out after the entree.  She forgot to bring the muffin that came with my husband's food, so she brougt it in a to-go container after the meal.  She took so long to come get our credit card that I walked up to the bar and she was helping a friend do her homework.  We told her a couple of times already that we were trying to make it to a movie and were in a rush, but apparently she didn't care!  What frustrated me the most was she didn't apologize for a single one of her numerous mistakes or offer to comp us any of the food that came out too late for us to eat.  \\n\\nThe food wasn't as good as the Mimi's in Austin, in my opinion.  The salad dressings were odd, the shrimp dish I ordered was somehow dripping grease (it wasn't fried, so I can't figure that one out), and the sundae dessert tasted like it was made with fake ice cream and syrup.\\n\\nFurthermore, the value of the food wasn't very good.

A little on the pricey side, Champions was worth the price for the good service and big TVs.\\n\\nMy big positive experiences were the fantasy football drafts I've hosted at Champions over the past 4 years. No hassles and very accommodating. We would have a space reserved for us, a starting appetizer, and a draft board all for free.

We went with a small group expecting a 5 star experience for a special occassion.   The prices and reviews relfect a 5 star high-end restaurant, however the location is a basic strip mall next to a jack in the box and other low end retail businesses.   The interior was simple and clean but not upscale.   The service was friendly but not very attentive, again at a high end restaurant one expects the waiter to constantly be checking or looking over to see if you need anything.   We had trouble getting the attention of our waiter.\\n\\nThe taste for the food was mixed but the presentation for everything was excellent.   The menu is limited in selection.   Entres ranged from $23 to $35 and salads were an additional $10 to $12 so average meal is $35 to $45 per person plus appetizers, wine, desserts, and tip.   \\n\\nThe chicken was fantastic as was the Ravioli with cranberries.    The filet (one of the most expensive items on the menu) was disappointing since it was served about room temperature or only slighly warm and was not trimmed and had too much fat for a filet.   The shrimp pasta was very bland and lacked any flavor or interest as did the spagetti carbonara.   The salads were ok but for $11 salads the portions were tiny (almost a joke to be honest...a couple people laughed when they were placed on the table).   The Fennel salad tasted terrible and was extremely bitter.   The disappointment was the waiter noticed the Fennel salad was not touched and he asked if there was a problem with it.   We told him it tasted terrible and he did not offer to exchange it for anything else.   I kind of expect that at high end restaurants if the food is bad the waiter would offer to bring something else instead of just taking it away with all the dirty dishes.\\n\\nFinally the wines were ok and flavorful but again the portions were extremely small (maybe 5 ounces at most).\\n\\nOverall a big disapointment.    There are much better italian places that provide flavorful food, a much better ambiance, and better value.

I, of course, chose Pattycake Bakery. This local vegan bakery is a hidden gem. I ordered a half dozen of their deluxe cupcakes over the phone two days prior to my pick up date. They make 4 flavors of cupcakes; thrilla vanilla, seriously good chocolate, carrot cake, and lovely lemon. I told them to include all 4 flavors to make an assortment. They decided the breakdown of how many of each flavor for me. They had my order boxed and ready at my requested time. I was able to sample their incredible I  Chocolate Chips cookies while they were checking me out and they were so amazing.  I had to add some cookies to my purchase too. The cookies are extremely soft and they easily break apart, but no matter what shape they are going into your mouth the moment the cookie hits your taste buds you are in love.

We took the opportunity to try it out on Christmas Day since it was one of a few places open. We always read reviews before we try something new and I have to agree with the negative reviews posted. Service was lacking. We had reservations and were taken to be seated, just to be asked to go back to the bar because our table wasn't ready. Once seated, 3 different servers asked if we had been helped. The staff obviously didn't have the support needed for the volume of guests that night. The best dish I had was the onion soup. My husband's mushroom soup was a bit cold but flavorful. My grouper was like chewing on an old belt. When my husband cut into his leg of lamb, it was like cutting into the turkey on the National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. We ordered creme br√ªl√©e for dessert which was burnt and clumpy.

The first thing I noticed was the prices (I think because it has been a while of having sandwiches, the prices seemed more on the expensive side) but ordered a deal for a skinny mushroom melt sandwich and chicken noodle soup for $7.10, saving about 80 cents. \\n\\nThe first thing I realized after I ordered and moved towards the register to pay, was that the counter was really high up and felt that I had to stand on my tippy toes. The second was the convenient packing of the sandwich, in a tube like bag so it actually fits the sandwich. \\n\\nAs I picked my spot to eat, I noticed my table had not been cleaned all the way with crumbs on one side (I just used the other side) and wondered if the employees wipe down the tables because I was the only customer there. The overall seating area is large with restrooms to the side wall. They even have outlets on the wall where I was as I needed to charge my phone so another plus, but was very slow in terms of charging. \\n The mushroom melt sandwich had a thin layer of mushrooms, expected a little more but the cheese and mustard made up for it, I think it was a horseradish mustard that made the sandwich for me. The bread too was perfectly rectangular and the ends were not rounded out so you didn't have the toppings falling off as it framed everything beautifully.  Chicken noodle soup however was disappointing with three ingredients of noodles, carrots, and chicken. The chicken pieces were quite large though.\\n\\nAs I ate, a handful of people came in to eat and looked like things were picking up. They seem to offer a lot more than sandwiches as they have desserts like shakes, smoothies, and cookies. Not sure if I will be back but it was good try new sandwiches while in a different area."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"***This review only concerns Amazon Restaurant Delivery***\\nI ordered two entrees, a mango lassi, an iced masala chai and samosa from Amazon Restaurant, and my delivery came with only two entrees.

The maple butter stuff was overwhelmingly sweet and mapley.  Normally I wouldn't complain about maple being mapley but this goop was everywhere and with way too much of it.  If I want a waffle swimming in maple syrup I'll check out a greasy spoon and get a table to myself and a fork.  If I want a waffle folded in half with two Jimmy Dean patties stuffed inside, I will head over to a bachelor's house and stay $4 richer.\\n\\nThinking this was maybe kind of a standalone dud, I went with a plain waffle next.  Once again, it was just a folded up ok-tasting waffle.  I guess they were out of the nectar of the gods that they must put into their waffles to generate all these five star reviews the day I came here.  Oh yeah, and my second waffle was pretty undercooked so I got mouthfuls of batter from time to time.

I got the Blackened Salmon salad. The very generous and slightly spicy salmon was cooked well, but the \\"mixed greens\\" was a bed of iceberg. The dressing \\"honey vinaigrette\\" was also fairly unimpressive. I did like the salad ingredients as a whole (baby spinach, mixed greens with fresh strawberries, candied pecans, sliced red onion & bleu cheese crumbles) and the strawberries were both fresh and delicious. I was also happy that I was able to get my dressing on the side. I found the lemonade neither acidic enough nor sweet enough (not worth the calories - should have gotten a beer).\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Oven Roasted Chicken salad and was then asked if she wanted it grilled or something else (fried) which confused me since it's \\"oven roasted chicken\\" salad. Fortunately, she enjoyed the salad in spite of this weirdness. She said that her iced tea was a bit strong, so she added a bit of my lemonade to it, which improved it a bit. Perhaps they should actually offer an \\"Arnold Palmer\\" on the menu. \\n\\nOverall, our experience was simply middle of the road. Adequate service, but not above-and-beyond. Nothing I'd go out of my way to either repeat or avoid. For a bar, and especially for the location, Rusty Bucket is a fairly sure bet - just don't go there expecting something special."},{"name":"Windy City Pizza","address":"516 Gallivan Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2.5","text":"Disgusting!

There are just so many places in Boston to try and we plan on doing our best to visit them all but this one jumped out to us because it sounded so unique.\\n\\nLocated in one of the nicest parts of Boston, Myers + Chang has a modern, sleek design with authentic Asian decor. It's a small space and reservations were hard to come by so I suggest to make yours a few days in advance. We made our reservation on Friday morning via OpenTable and all they had left for that night was 5:15 pm and 10 pm.\\n\\nWe arrived a little bit earlier than our reservation time and still only waited for 15 minutes before being seated. The staff was extremely nice and the waitress was very helpful, suggesting numerous dishes since this was our first time. Myers + Chang is a family style restaurant meaning that your food comes out in random order so make sure you place your entire order at once. Don't order the appetizers and then wait to order the entrees. If you do that, your entree ticket gets pushed to the back of the line and you'll wait longer than you have to.  Also, the dishes are smaller so if you're in a group, don't be afraid to order a bunch of things to share.\\n\\nWe decided to go with the Spare Ribs, the Pork Buns and the Dumplings as appetizers and the Surf + Turf Shanghai Noodles and Korean BBQ Sloppy Joe as entrees.

Absolutely incredible. \\n\\nWe had no room left for desert but I did see a couple order what looked like Rice Pudding and it looked very tempting. \\n\\nAll in all, the best Asian restaurant I've ever eaten in anywhere in the country and most definitely one of my favorites in Boston."},{"name":"Babette's Cafe","address":"573 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So the 4 of us had such a nice brunch here last week, I'm going back this weekend as well.

Most of the staff are lovely.  Our servers personality was delightful.  The menu was great, and the server was awesome in putting a rush on the kids' orders since they were ravenous.  The plating of all food was nice.  And the food, in general, came out fresh and in a relatively timely manner.\\n\\nBut then everyone was served except for me.  We waited a little longer, since I had ordered an entree, while everyone else had more \\"lunchy\\" food.  But, when the server came back to check on how our meals were, she didn't even notice that I had no meal.  When I pointed this out, she was quick to say that the kitchen must have been backed up, and she'd ask them to rush.  I watch her go to the kitchen.  I see the expediter shake his head and show her the ticket she submitted.  I saw her go to the computer and put in my order for the first time.\\n\\nI was a server for upwards of 15 years.  This happens.  Yes, we had more of the park to explore.  But this happens, and our family is understanding of such things.  But when she came back to me, didn't take ownership for her error, and told me it would be another few minutes because the kitchen made an error, I was pretty done.  Own up to your stuff, hon, especially when your customer ordered a seafood dish with five different types of seafood, all of which take different times to cook, and a dish that takes a good 15-20 minutes to prepare.\\n\\nSo, you know the drill: everyone was done before mine even arrived, the kids were getting antsy, so I had to rush through a considerably expensive entree (by lunch standards), and not get the full awesomeness of the truly brilliant and sizable dish. Truly one of the best seafood curry dishes I've ever had, and I couldn't savor it.  Had she been upfront and owned her mistake, this would've been a much less upsetting happening, even with having been looking forward to this meal for months.\\n\\nThen she brought the bill.  The dessert, which I'd ordered at the same time of the entree, but which she never brought to the table, was still on my bill.  Besides the fact that AT LEAST my dessert, if not both my dessert and drink, should've been comped from the bill for such an inconvenience, at least remove the food you never brought.  I point this out to her.  She forgot that menu item, too.  So she says she'll remove it.  I'm getting really annoyed at this point.  So I inform her that, removed from the bill or not, I was getting this dessert to go.  She left it on the menu, brought it in a to-go container, and set it down in front of me upside down.  So all of the whipped cream and fruit on top of the pie was now smashed against the container, and I still have to shove it in my face as we were running out the door to make a show for the kiddos.\\n\\nAnd, still, nothing comped on the bill.\\n\\nWhy 3-stars?  Because the chefs here are amazing.  Both dishes were among some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  I live in NYC and have traveled quite a bit internationally.  I've been blessed to know quality cuisine.  And these chefs beyond hit the mark, at least with the dishes I ordered.\\n\\nI would go back on another visit to Animal Kingdom, though I will be wary."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was not expecting to love this place.

But don't judge a book by it's cover. Inside are some the the most delicious, light and airy, yet oh-so-crusty loaves and rolls of bread on the North Shore. Once you've gotten a taste for them, you can always tell which bakery they came from because Central makes their bread so tender and light on the inside, while still maintaining a very nice crust.\\n\\nNot much atmosphere, it's really just a carry-out place.

Using the coupons made the bland food worth it - $25 off a bill of $35 or more as long as it included two entrees and an 18% tip was added. It ended up being about half off, a great reason to justify pigging out - even if the food wasn't much to write home about.\\n\\nFast forward 3 months and I have one of these coupons left. Perfect timing because I was moving and had all of my cookware packed up. I called to confirm my coupon had not been used and the host that answered the phone told me he would check it out.

This is a good solid mid-level buffet. They have a combination of Chinese and Korean food, as well a variety of sushi rolls and even had tuna sashimi. While there is a variety of sushi rolls, the choice of fish is very limited (tuna, salmon, and maybe one more...), so, I would not consider this being a \\"sushi buffet\\", but that's fine.\\n\\nThe food is replenished reasonably quickly. The staff is quick with removing the used plates. A minor thing about service: for some reason, they take your glass away, together with your straw, - to refill the water (why not bring a pitcher to the table?), - I am always a bit concerned about what happens while my glass is away, and have they mixed glasses from different people on the table.\\n\\nBut the main negative factor that forces me to reduce the number of stars is the restrooms: both restrooms were in a bad condition, dirty, with paper towels overflowing the trash bins, dirt and water around the sinks.

She was on top of things well enough, but didn't show a lot of interest in us.  \\n\\nI had the chorizo burger, which was pretty fantastic.  I was intrigued by the shrimp burger (i.e. is it a patty made of shrimp glued together?  is it ground up shrimp formed into a patty?) but I couldn't pass up the chorizo.  If I can make it back again, I'll go shrimp.  The chorizo burger was quite good, and I noticed that the size of the burgers was really nice, actually.  Noticeably smaller than most restaurant burgers, it meant you could eat it and not feel like a fat fat fatty afterwards, even though I'm sure it was bad for me.\\n\\nWe also had a side of fries, which were superbly done.  Crispy and just the right amount of salt.  And since my girlfriend had never had fried okra, we had to order some, and it was delicious as well.  You just can't find this stuff back home in Colorado.\\n\\nShe had the turkey burger, which she liked, but I wasn't impressed by.  It was just kind of plain, which may not have been a fault elsewhere, but when I'm used to seeing Blais be inventive all the time, it was a little disappointing.  My dad had the pimento cheese burger, which he said he couldn't tell it was pimento cheese, which was also a little sad.\\n\\nWe had two shakes.

Leave your kids at home.\\n\\nEvery now and then, you want something special.  Maybe you're tired of Tex-Mex.  Or maybe it's your anniversary or you just got a promotion and want to celebrate with that special someone.  Or maybe you want to have a really good Italian meal.\\n\\nAndiamo is that kind of place.\\n\\nDon't expect much from the neighborhood.  If you drive up and down Burnet near IBM/The Domain, you've probably passed this place hundreds of times and never noticed it.  It's tucked away in a strip mall next to a non-descript vietnamese restaurant and some shops.  What it lacks on the outside, it more than makes up for on the inside.\\n\\nThis is a small restaurant.  There are maybe, at the most, 20-25 tables- mostly 2 tops.  It's fairly quiet (more on this later) and there was a mandolin player playing.  We had reservations but we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table mostly because there were two large groups with children (more on this later) who were taking up a lot of space.  The host was very apologetic and did keep us posted with frequent updates.  \\n\\nFor the appetizer,  I had the Insalata Innamorata and my partner had Insalata di Finnocchio.\\n\\nOur friend went for the tasting menu.\\n\\nThe Innamorata was quite good- a perfect portion, fresh and well-balanced.  My partner was happy with his salad.\\n\\nFor the main course, I had the Ravioli di Zucca.  My partner had the Filetto di Manzo.  \\n\\nI was very happy with the ravioli- it was fresh, perfectly al dente and although there were other choices available for the sauce, the sage-brown butter sauce was a nice complement to the pumpkin filling in the ravioli.  It was unusual and interesting and something unique.\\n\\nMy partner asked for his steak medium but it came out medium-rare which seems to happen with filet.  The gorgonzola cream sauce was good- not obnoxiously cheesey or sharp or too heavy.  The filet could have stood on its own quite well without the sauce.  \\n\\nThe tasting menu looked very good.  We tasted a few things from the choices and they were all quite nice.  And this friend, who is both Italian and a bit of a perfectionist, was very happy with this meal.  The great thing about the way that Andiamo does their tasting menu is that while the chef selects the dishes that you get, you are asked for food preferences, so you don't end up with a bunch of things that you don't like (and for $55, that's a good thing).  I was surprised at the portions.  Typically on a tasting menu, you get a couple of tablespoons of food with each course.  These were generous portions- more of what I would consider a lunch portion.  If you do the tasting menu, it will take about 2 hours to get through and it's probably better if everyone does it.  The staff did a great job of pacing things so that everyone's food came out in synch but there were a couple of periods where we were waiting on our friend while he ate his course and we were finished and ready to move on.\\n\\nI don't give many 5 stars.  This was a no brainer.  The service was excellent.  The staff were courteous and asked a lot of questions to try to make sure we found the right dish.  Everything was well-orchestrated- from the presentation of the food, to the timing of the dishes arriving and leaving the table, to the busperson's attentiveness to just really really good food.\\n\\nBut here's the mystery:  our reservation was at 8:30PM on a Saturday.  We were seated at 8:50PM.  There were screaming children running around the restaurant while their parents chatted oblivious to how obnoxious they were.  Couples in the restaurant glared at them.  People turned around and stared.  When one of the children arrived at our table, I told her to go back to her table and sit down.  Somebody had to be a parent.\\n\\nI'm just fed up with having my dining experience ruined by people taking their children to expensive restaurants where they don't pay attention to the fact that children have a 15 minute attention span.  Squealing and screaming and jumping around on the floor are not permissible in any restaurant, much less a restaurant like Andiamo.  In contrast, there was another group of people on the other side of the restaurant with a young boy of about 10 who sat at the table, ate his food and conducted himself like his parents had taught him how to act in restaurants.  So, it is possible to take a child to a nice restaurant without ruining it for everyone else.  But probably 9PM is a bit late for any child and if you don't want to parent your children, then maybe a family restaurant or Chuckey Cheese might be a better choice the next time."},{"name":"Ebi-Ten","address":"388 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This Japanese fast food restaurant is a little gem in Vancouver.

The line was long but it went pretty fast, they have a great system. Someone takes your order while you're in line and they find you a table, then you pay. And you can get a drink while you wait. We watched them make the buns while we waited, kind of cool. Omg buns were so fresh and good! They sat us, the fries came out almost immediately. Burgers just after we demolished the fries. We all shared. They were all so tasty! I was surprised to find the Impossible Foods burger here in Texas. Thought it was only being served in Los Angeles and NYC. Texas did it up right. So good. If you are not a meat eater (or even if you are) you have try one, it's a meat substitute made from potatoes, wheat, coconut oil and soy root bulbs, food scientists (and 180 bucks) in Silicon Valley have been working for 6 years to make something that looks, tastes, sizzles and bleeds like meat. They are only being served in a few restaurants across the US. Read up on it, it's pretty cool.

From books on how to be a Parisian (replete with how to be a snob), to life-size chess boards, and oodles and oodles of library books (hmm, the smell), to the invigorating & addicting smell of coffee and tea, there's a lot for you to enjoy here. \\n\\nThere's a chair swing to appeal to the child in you and comfy chairs with artsy throw pillows. The seating options and arrangements are vast from the sofa-style to the bar-stool style. You choose your pick!\\n\\nOnce you can get past the pleasant distraction, make a beeline for the counter where you can order via an Ipad station. This too is oddly satisfying as they have pictures and categories of all of their profiteroles, coffees, and tea selection. Once you make your selection, you can check out and pay via cash or card. \\n\\nI ordered the matcha latte and the olive oil cake, which turned out to be really yummy and tasty.\\n\\nThey have some card games and tic-tac-toes too that you can indulge in while hanging out with your friends.\\n\\nIt's a good place to study however they have a no-laptop policy which I hear they try to enforce.

Yet I find the atmosphere to be charming. The corridor to the restroom reveal closets and a stairway full of mom-and-pop clutter, the controlled chaos of a small biz, but this for me is kinda comforting and authentic, like a friend you can be yourself around. They keep it clean though, not a dust flake can be found. They play great music here, cool indy stuff. \\n\\nThe food here kick it all. Food quality hasn't lost its greatness to the ravages of time.

I am a Cuban lover, and the taste of it here is so much sensual to be the measure of all cubans.\\n\\n-- Ben's Black and Blue: Roast beef can be blah at many places ( as well as for supermarket lunch meat.) Here they have combined the best beef with gorgonzola(!!!) tomato on marble rye and--bang, transformation of da bland to da bomb.\\n\\n--Last night I had the Classic Club:  the boring deli cliche here made into the Platonic ideal.

Cold Chinese food at a restaurant horrifies me. \\n\\n*Steamed seabass with topped ginger and cilantro: You cold tell by the texture of the fish--which had no turgidity--that it was previously frozen. It's a dish I would never get again there if they were open. \\n\\nAside from the food, our server disappeared for long periods. Where did he go? lol. \\n\\nRegarding the inside, the tables, ceiling, walls, and floor were dirty. Usually, I can overlook those things, but the restaurant's filthiness made my skin crawl.

Also for the steak, the dressing tasted very odd, vinegary and much too sweet like molasses. it kind of ruined the flavor of the meat and veggies if it touched it.  \\n\\nThe chicken though was fantastic!

I came here tonight with a group of seven, and it was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday night.  We had put our names in for bowling, and the wait was about an hour, which was fine since there are a lot of other games to play in the meantime.  I really enjoyed the overall vibes of this place.  Classy bowling, good food and drinks, lots of games - what else can you ask for?  \\n\\nI ordered the Clover Club for my drink (gin, pomegranate grenadine, lemon, egg white).  I enjoyed it.  The egg white might sound weird if you've never had it in your cocktail before, but I highly recommend it!  My only issue was that I wasn't expecting such a tiny cocktail (literally maybe six sips at most).  This might also be because I just came from hot yoga and I was pretty thirsty [insert jokes here].  Their drinks are pretty reasonably priced.  Most of the cocktails on the menu are under $10.\\n\\nAfter playing some bocce ball, shuffleboard, skee ball, basketball, darts, and the skittles game - finally time to bowl!  Well, it was time for me to eat.  A couple of us bowled, and a couple of us hung out and ate, drank, and cheered on our friends.  I was tempted to try the tacos tonight, but went for the pizza instead, and I'm glad I did.  I'm sure the tacos would've been great, so I'll have to try those next time, but...let me tell you about the pizza.  Spicy chorizo pizza & Korean BBQ chicken pizza ($14 each).  Wow!  What unique pizzas.   The flavors were amazing in both, and none too overwhelming.  I liked that it was thin crust, and very crispy.  Fries were hot and crispy too.  It paired well with the side of garlic aioli.  I never thought I'd have such an extensive review of the food and drink... at a bowling alley!  \\n\\nAll in all, this is a really fun place to come hang out with friends.  It's a spacious venue and they seem to always have good music playing.

Don't ever do what I did, as I was with a female:\\n\\nWaitress: \\"What would you like to eat?\\"\\nMe: \\"I'll have the breasts and buns, please!\\"\\nWaitress: \\"Haha, excuse me?\\"\\nMe: \\"Shit, I'm sorry, I meant the buffalo chicken sandwich, hot sauce, and cheese fries\\"\\n\\nI couldn't believe I said that!  I have never done that, EVER in my life- guess there is a first time for everything!\\n\\nMy friend, she ordered fried pickles.  They came out first.  For someone who detests pickles, I had a few- they were different!\\n\\nThen my food came out.  The bread didn't taste too good (very fluffy and dry for the amount of meat).  But the chicken and the fries were amazing.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, I really like what they did to this place.  It looks nice, the service (although slow at times) was accurate and very friendly.  Even the managers came by to check on us.  The bathroom shocked me too for a Hooters.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of the chain, you got to check this place out!

Ordered the Mahi sandwich, which was smothered in cheese (fish & cheese??), it was so salty couldn't eat it so I asked the server if I could order something else.  Ordered the fish (seared Ahi) tacos, again, horrible!  The Ahi was not fresh and cooked well done!  I thought it was pork at first because it was so brown and covered in some horrid brown sauce that I was unable to identify.  When the server FINALLY returned (15 mins after receiving tacos), I complained and asked for the check.  She came back and told me she had to charge me for one of them, I replied with a friendly 'that's not going to happen, I want to speak to the manager/owner)!'  The food was inedible and I didn't eat it, why would I pay for anything?  She disappeared again to speak to the owner.  She returned explaining that because they aren't a corporate restaurant and they have food-cost issues, the owner wouldn't adjust the check.  I asked to speak to owner, another 10 minutes as she went to speak to the COWARDLY OWNER who never showed their face when another server appeared and announced that she had indeed adjusted the check.  Server explained that they had to charge me for the fries (15 fries on plate of which I consumed 4 of).  I was so fed up and just wanted to get out of there so I paid and left!  I tipped the server because I felt bad for her only to regret it afterwards because I had the worst service ever!  She never even apologized so I guess I'll chalk it up to a pity-tip!  Afterwards, walked around Mount Dora a while only to find out from other locals that this place is the worst place to eat on the street!  No wonder it was so empty!  I generally look at Yelp reviews prior to eating anywhere, I clearly didn't this time and this is what happened!

We arrived just before 11am, so we hit the quiet time before the lunch rush.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Free parking located behind the restaurant. Sweet!\\n- Unlike other establishments serving similar food, the service here is actually friendly and attentive (if at times, a little too pushy and attentive, maybe). No having to beg for a glass of water, or stink-eye when you ask for something not on the carts. Our tea and water was always full, as were our plates.\\n- They still have carts, and that's half the experience for me. Not that ordering off a list sushi-style is bad, but I enjoy the cart envy when I see another group getting something tasty that I haven't tried yet. :-)\\n- The food, while a bit Americanized, is good. It's not going to blow your mind, but there is plenty to pick from and I didn't have a dumpling I didn't enjoy. Really pretty tasty.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The decor, especially the seat covers. It's not worth deducting a point over, but it's nothing to write home about.\\n- I happen to have a high tolerance for salt, my husband not as much. For him, the food was a tad on the salty side. Add to that the fact that there are a lot of fried options, and things get heavy really fast...\\n- We got here early, and noticed the variety of food was slim until around 11am when more people started to show up. Would recommend arriving just before that rush to get a seat without waiting but still get the full menu. \\n\\nBottom line: Would definitely come back to, and recommend, this place for dim sum. It's a nice change of pace to have some friendly service, the food was good, we left full and happy. We could probably drive out further and find more authentic grub, but its location to the city and the fact that it still serves on carts means we probably won't bother.\\n\\nPresentation (1-5): 2\\nAmbiance and Decor (1-5): 1\\nQuality of Service (1-5): 4\\nFavorite Menu Item: The shrimp dumplings were pretty darn good\\nBest Suited For: People looking for a non-intimidating dim sum experience\\nKid Friendly?

Yes"},{"name":"Checkerboard Pizza","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I personally really like their pepperoni pizza.

The bark is my favorite part of brisket and I would recommend this brisket to everyone. The turkey was also so good! I tasted very fresh and clean...I'm not sure if that's a way to describe turkey but it was delicious!  I could tell that the turkey was all natural which definitely makes me want to go back for more. The cream corn was hands down the best I have ever had. I used to be a fan of Rudy's cream corn but I have to say Terry Black's is better. The potato salad was great too! The seasoning on everything was definitely what you would expect from a BBQ restaurant plus more. \\n\\nOverall I would recommend Terry Black's Barbecue to everyone!

The tacos were served with two salsas - one red & one green.  The red salsa was refreshing and was pretty mild with just enough zip for a breakfast taco.  The tortillas are amazing and freshly made.

It can be a bit dry at times, but this is often the case with banquet style persian food. The lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone succulent. I loved it, but if you aren't fond of the lamb taste, it can be a bit too strong for you. We got the Koobideh, the Chicken Barg, and another chicken skewer that I can't remember. To be honest, nothing really stood out. It was good, but not \\"i'm craving it right now\\" good. \\n\\nDessert was showcased to us on a platter that the waitress brings to the table. We chose the pastry and the baklava. The pastry was decent, but the baklava was very hard and had a non-baklava taste to it.

Delicious.  Even though I once asked them to leave the butter off the roll and they instead left the goat cheese off, I still forgave them because it was so yummy.  \\n\\nHaving recently been to Parish, I simply asked them to leave feta off my white bean hummus veggie wrap and it was not a problem.

We sampled quite a few burgers from Greek inspired lamb, traditional beef, and even the fancy Wagyu. All were flavorful and prepared well with tasty sides and awesome milkshakes. \\n\\nThis was a few years back around when they first opened. Nowadays, Flip Burger Boutique has lost most of the quality we expect from an upscale burger joint in an effort to stay flashy, trendy, and hip. With Blais winning Top Chef All Stars and expanding his stardom through Food Network, his little burger restaurant is getting a huge boom in business that is leaving the Flip Burger management team struggling to maintain the once high level of quality.\\n\\nThe worst times to come are on busy nights. The restaurant is extremely dark to the point where food can barely be seen and the noise level of the techno / dance music makes it impossible to hold a conversation without yelling. I was never a fan of the seating arrangement - very cramp communal tables with uncomfortable bar height seats that have to be shared with other guests. Add that to the crowd of customers filling the place wall to wall, bordering on a fire hazard, and you can just forget about having any mobility, comfort, or even safety while eating.\\n\\nFood during the last few visits was a disappointment.

They also have been hit with the same bug. One of them cried in a desperate voice: \\" come onnnn, I really got to gooo\\" while clawing at the locked door of my stall. He even grabbed the top of the door and leaped in a pathetic attempt to climb over. I unfortunately was not in a situation to dispense help though I greatly desired to do so.

Personally, I've never had Sushi that has satisfied me remotely as much as this place and I usually don't order Sushi anywhere else. The Atmosphere and service are terrific, although parking can be kind of an issue. They have amazing Maki (Spicy Tuna, Onion Scallion-Tempura, Sweet Potato-Tempura, Vegetable Rice Paper to name my favorites.) Their Gyoza dumplings and Teriyaki noodles are an excellent start to your meal and the Deep Fried Cheesecake and fried Ice Cream are the perfect end. I have been here so many times and I have NEVER had bad food or service. The food is not really expensive but you may rack up a big bill because you will want to keep ordering things. This may be my favorite restaurant on Earth and while I'm sure some people may have unfortunately had a bad experience here (for whatever weird reason) I urge you to take their reviews with a grain of salt and let yourself love this place.

But they do have a late happy hour--from 9 to 12--in addition to the usual one that ends at 6. \\n\\nWe started with the taster tray of beers--8 little glasses, two of which were seasonal--and some food. I got the bleu pig, a sandwich of balsamic-marinated pork loin with caramelized onions, garlic mayo, and bleu cheese on ciabatta, while he ordered the reuben. They were both very yummy, hearty, and filling. My tater tots were crispy and not too salty; his fries were decent but pretty unremarkable. The food arrived piping hot in a timely manner.\\n\\nOut of the sampler tray, our favorite was the sockeye cream stout, although boyfie also liked c-note. \\n\\nThe servers were attentive and friendly, but not too.

But when the drink arrived, my boyfriend wasn't so sure it was captain morgans, and  the tea was bagged stash chai rather than tazo. Aside from that, our disappointment was our own fault--we had expected the chai made with milk and chai concentrate, not bags steeped in water. But we asked for some half-and-half, and it was pretty tasty after we added that.\\n\\nThen, he ordered a pint of centennial IPA, which wasn't included in the sampler. He says it was alright, but he likes the c-note better. I got a coffee nudge off the winter cocktail menu (coffee, dark cream de cacao, kahlua, brandy, and whipped cream, according to the menu). They were out of whipped cream, but with another adorable tiny pitcher of half-and-half the drink was sweet and very tasty. I would order it again, preferably next time it snows.\\n\\nFor food and service alone, we would both give this place three stars.

Juicy, pink center. Bursting with meaty flavor. Thick and generously portioned. One of the best hamburger patties I've ever had.\\n- The toppings: Largely solid, except for the heirloom tomato, which was flavorless, unripe, and all-around mediocre. Just because something is organic or an heirloom cultivar doesn't mean it's necessarily good. \\n- The bun: Just how I like it -- functional, but not so noticeable that it distracts from what's inside.\\n- The sauce: Excellent. The flavor of this thousand island-style dressing is light enough to complement but not overwhelm. And they're fairly careful in not slopping on too much.\\n- Burger construction: I don't know why people are calling the burgers here \\"sliders\\" -- they certainly aren't. But they're not huge, either. Rather, they're sized just right, both portion-wise and fits-into-your-mouth-wise.\\n\\nMy side of onion rings was delicious, too. While these rings contain more breading than onion, the breading is totally solid -- crispy, light, and not too greasy. While the honey mustard dip is just OK, the rings are fine on their own, as they're heavily salted and sprinkled with a few fresh herbs -- rosemary and chives, perhaps?\\n\\nI grabbed a taste of some of the fries here, too. They're really good, having been fried a little longer than usual for extra crispiness.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is a little obnoxiously trendy, and the parking lot outside is a little cramped. But a trip out here for the beef burgers is worth it.\\n\\n(Note: If you pay by card, check your statement. I recently got hit with a second, identical charge about seven days after my initial visit.

I admit I laughed, as this was my first experience with a lettuce wrap. Wasn't going to work for me.

There was another roll, but I wasn't sure what it was, maybe a roll with some tuna on top and some hot sauce.

We got 2 pieces of sirloin steak and a whole fried branzino fish and some sort of papaya salad with vermicelli. The steak was pretty good, but only got a couple pieces. The fish was just ok, but seemed to be missing something, could have used something like a Thai chili sauce. The papaya salad need more twang to it. It wasn't sour or spicy, it was a little bland. This course came with basmati rice, this was strange. You normally serve basmati rice with a sauce or curry or else it has no flavour.\\n\\n3rd Course - Dessert, after the first 2 courses I wasn't expecting much for dessert, but it was actually pretty good, there was a little cheesecake, some ice cream, a macaroon, a banana cake that was all tasty. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good although there was a long delay between courses, it took us 2 hours to eat dinner.\\n\\nAnyways, the deal was $89 for a $150 meal, we ordered a couple glasses of wine so the final bill was about $59 with tip (I gave a $20 tip, cause our server was pretty good but the food meh!). To be honest for a total of $148 I could have made a more tasty choice elsewhere. This meal was not worth $150 plus wine and tip. I won't be coming back to this place.\\n\\nI checked out the regular menu, they charge $24 for halibut and chips. Really? I doubt their offering is as good as Go Fish or Pajos.\\n\\nSorry, having a nice place with house/fashion show music is not enough, your food has to be decent."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We took a trip out last night for a great experience.  We didn't have reservations and that was a mistake, if you are heading out definitely reserve a table, even on a Wednesday the place was very busy.  We arrived around 6:30pm and stayed until nearly close and there was never more then 1 or 2 tables open.  We were lucky to be sat at the kitchen bar so we could witness the action and interact a bit with the chefs.\\n\\nThe dining here is very different then traditional service, you order food and it comes out as it is made, so you can't really order for progression without breaking up your order.  I kind of like this as we were out for a casual night with no time parameters.\\n\\nWe started with the Lemony Shrimp potstickers which were really tasty and cooked well, I thought it could perhaps you a pop more of citrus, but I would not complain if I had this again.  We also had the sweet & sour Brussels sprouts and as a fan of sprouts I can tell you these were good, caramelized on the leaves and really tender, served with pickled red onions and mint, definitely worth it.  Lastly, we had braised pork belly buns, now I love pork buns, I think they are one of the best things in dim sum, and using pork belly, oh it doesn't get better.  I think by far the best thing we had of the night.\\n\\nWe then ordered the Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice), sadly it was a little to spicy for my date, but I loved the flavors on it.  The one knock we had with this is when it arrived it was recommended we break the yolk of the egg and mix it in however the egg was over hard.  This was quickly fixed when pointed out and a new egg was cooked (we were offered a new dish, but insisted just a nicely over easy fried egg was good enough).\\n\\nLastly we ordered the Wok-Charred Octopus and Grilled corn.  This was really tasty and cooked well, but since my date doesn't do spice we ordered it without Sirachi butter.  As a result I thought it lacked some seasoning.\\n\\nMy one recommendation is making sure you enjoy szechuan or a little heat in your food, it seems like most things that looked and sounded the most tasty had a spicy level.\\n\\nOverall, I will be back"},{"name":"Coast Restaurant","address":"1054 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Maybe I'm a sad prairie-dweller but this was a GREAT spot for lunch.

However, despite never receiving our bowling shoes, we were charged for them.

His response: \\"you paid by the hour.\\" \\n\\nAgain, an hour that still had 10 minutes left. This really changed what WAS a great night. We left upset.

However the fried shrimp roll was not so good because it had way too much ginger. Then we ordered a peeking duck. Now that is one of the best peeking ducks we have ever had. We have been to Toronto best to china in peeking even and it was not as good. The peeking duck was 38 dollars (a fair bit but well worth it) The peeking duck was served first with the pieces if skin which you put on mushu (sort of like a crepe) and then you add green onion and hoisin to taste.\\nOur waiter (Amy) was very nice and friendly and was very good at understanding us.

Sweet - the Gilberto: fresh strawberries, banana, whipped cream, nutella, and chocolate syrup.  Obviously you can't mess anything up where a main ingredient is nutella.  Savory - the Early Birdie: turkey, egg whites, pepper jack, tomatoes and spinach (but you can choose the cheese and veggies).  I got this with the cajun sauce.

It was well worth the wait!! \\n\\nBetween the four of us we had the Turkey Burger, the Bacon Cheeseburger, and the Butcher's Cut. The turkey burger was flavorful and juicy, the avocado and ketchup were perfect compliments. Easily the best I've had. The other members of the party raved about their burgers, primarily just the surprising way all the parts went together. Flip definitely combines creative flavors with fantastic outcomes! \\n\\nThe sides were complementary and surprising in their own right. Fried pickles = YUM!, the fries were crispy and actually tasted like potatoes as opposed to grease, my salad was delicious as well. I've reserved the sweet potato tots for their own paragraph. \\n\\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the sweet potato tots since they seem to be such a controversial item. Well, they weren't on the menu anymore. Our server very honestly shared with us that they had been removed due to the love/hate relationship most diners had with them. I'm glad I asked, because he was able to get us a side of them to try and thus offer our opinion. Frankly, they were wonderful!! The outside was crispy and light, the inside was gooey and delightful if a little too hot temperature-wise. Supposedly these can be very greasy, our batch was cooked perfect. If you are there, give them a try and let them know what you think. The good news is, they are listening to feedback and working to improve. If they can get these to be consistently good like ours last night then we need to get them back on the menu!! \\n\\nNow on to the milkshakes...  \\nI am still thinking about how delish my Orange Creamsicle shake was. Still. I eat super healthy 98% of the time, when I slip up it is for a good cause and this shake was no exception. We also had the Krispy Kreme and Peach shakes at our table. I do not exaggerate when I tell you I really felt like I was eating a doughnut with just a sip of the shake. Crazy good! \\n\\nFlip did not fail to live up to our expectations even as they grew over the course of 4 months.

I ordered the burger with fries and a coke, the standard fare there.  The burger was very good.  I would go back with friends.  They have a lot of toppings you can choose for your burger.  The french fries were not very good:  crispy outside and soft empty inside.  I will not touch a fry there again. The non-trans fat oil that they cook the fries in completely destroys the taste in my opinion. The shakes and drinks are fine.  The produce always seems to be fresh.  The cost of the burger is just under $6 or so, depending on if you get a single or double burger.  The staff was friendly and efficient in getting the burgers to your table. \\n\\nAt this time there is no beer served there. Since there is a large ooze factor from the burger, the napkins they have cannot stand up to the drippings.  You need to protect your shirt (and tie if you wear one) from the drippings with lots of napkins.  The ooze factor of the burgers depends on how you cook it, with medium rare having a lot of ooze.  The condiments you choose can have drippings as well.\\n\\nHow do they compare to Mighty Fine Burgers, Elevation Burgers, Terra Burgers, 5 Guys Burger, or Gabbi's? They would come in 1st in burgers and 6th in fries. \\n\\nSumming up:  Burgers very good; fries not so good; service good; store nice; location fine; ample parking.\\n\\nWould I go back?  Yes with friends, but only if that is where they chose to go; by myself, yes but rarely.\\n\\n\\nNote:  My disclaimer on fries, since I did not really like any of the fries due to the new cooking oils, I cannot say that you would not like them.

While the decor feels very much like a typical cafe, the ambiance is much more lively. Plus the menu features beer and wine in addition to just coffee and tea. \\n\\nThe place is not very big and gets quite full on sunny weekend days. Luckily, it doesn't seem like a place people tend to stay in for long periods of time so a seat is likely to become available very quickly. \\n\\nThe place is very loud and definitely not for studying or reading. Most people are there to catch up with friends and chatter fills the space. \\n\\nThe pastries there are amazing! The maple brown sugar cronut was sooo delicious. It wasn't overly sweet or oily as I expected it to be, but rather a nice pairing with a cup of coffee. Since they serve alcohol, there are also drinks with Baileys shots!

More than anything though, they also had an option of waffle fries for additional $2 BUT IT IS NOT WORTH IT. The waffle fries were so dry, hard (not crunchy) and tasteless. I debated on paying extra for my own set of side of waffle fries for more but I thought it would be the same. I was looking forward to the waffle fries too but they were very disappointing. \\n\\nOverall, the service and the interior design is great but the food is not so much.

Super nice and bubbly and really took care of us.\\n\\nWe always order two dozen oysters in a variety plus add toasties and either soup or salad.\\n\\nOysters are consistently fresh and presented well.\\n\\nThe first three visits the toasties were HUGE.  We ordered the ahi tuna with avocado toasty and the tomato garlic toasty.  The bread was also sliced thick and was delicious. We noticed on our visit last night that the size and thickness was approximately 25% smaller. Probably a cost cutting move. They were delicious and I still consider them a good value but we were really spoiled with the original generous portion sizes.\\n\\nOn the second visit the manager (not sure of her name) heard us complimenting the food and service. My partner is from Alabama and they had oysters from Alabama fresh from Coffee Island Alabama. Without even asking she brought over free samples of the Alabama oysters. A really nice touch!!\\n\\nLast night we had two dozen oysters in a variety with toasties plus an order of oysters Rockefeller. We also ordered a bottle of the Bellman Prosecco, the same that we love and order each time. A good value for $36.\\n\\nService again was excellent.

Before we get to the review of food - I would like to point out that the place was packed with about a 10 - 15 min wait AND they don't have an area for waiting, nor do they allow you to stand at the bar (not sure if that's a Boston thing or just a there thing) - which means you either stand in a little corridor as people come in and out or wait outside. If it was nice out - I wouldn't have minded but it was like 15 degrees that day. \\n\\nOkay back to the food - The beef skewers was eh. I asked for some olive oil to eat with the bread which they didn't have.  We ordered a pie (no slices served here), half reg and half sausage.  The regular was decent, no complaints.  the sausage had a bit too much black pepper and salt.  The pie itself was pretty small - about six or eight slices about the size of my (girly) hand (kinda of like a papa johns slice) .  I did enjoy that it was thin and crispy. Also, the waiter - an older gentleman who seemed to have work there for some time was nice to us. \\n\\nAs for the menu - I was disappointed I went to pizzaria without any calzones, knots, parms, etc. but that's just me, and like I said - I'm from New York."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great BBQ, fast and friendly.

The waitress was present, but not overwhelming. She could sense we had a lot to discuss, so was around, but not forceful. Good drink specials and variety on the menu. I started with the spinach salad, which comes with gorgonzola, candied walnuts, pomegranate seeds, red onion and a fresh prosecco vinaigrette. Reasonable size and the flavors all mixed together well. For my main course, I went for the pappardelle bolognese, which was really well done - a good balance of sauce to pasta ratio on the plate. For dessert, I went with the ever-classic tiramisu. A good way to finish off the meal. My dining companions also enjoyed their three courses and with wine, the overall bill was reasonable. I had a colleague in town looking for a restaurant and Gusto was the first place that came to mind (he was looking for something in between Round Rock and South Austin) and he enjoyed himself as well.

I've never been here to eat. In fact, I didn't even know that they served food here until I saw some of the other reviews. It looks good - I definitely may give that a try, but as far as the club scene goes, I'll pass.\\n\\n#1 problem is the location. When you're going out for a night of drinking you tend to go to places that are in safe locations, near other bars so you can bar hop if you want, and possibly close enough to walk or it's easy to get a cab. BoMA is none of these things. It's on Broad St. east of downtown, near 71. There is nothing else out there. Nothing. If you're going to BoMA, you're likely staying here all night. And the area isn't exactly a place you want to be walking around at night. There aren't a lot of cabs out here. As I'm sure you are aware, downtown is pretty much dead at night with the exception of the crazies. \\n\\nProblemo #2: The crowd. Cougar territory! Seriously. I saw so many women over 40 preying on young men it was ridiculous. And these women were all dressed up in fancy cocktail dresses and gowns. What was going on? There were a lot of wealthy older men here as well, and it led me to believe that older swinger couples likely come here to find some young meat. Creepy. There were some people here in their 20's, so it was the weirdest mix I've ever seen. I didn't know what to make of it. But I had way too many old guys trying to buy me drinks and it was getting uncomfortable.\\n\\n#3: The music. Was this a rave? I've never been to one, but this is what I imagined them to be like. Wow there was some techno. Pounding beats for every song and there was a lot of flashing neon strobe lights. Don't come here if you're epileptic. Just don't. I distinctly remember a \\"Closer\\" by Nine Inch Nails remix. They ruined the song with techno beats, but I think the purpose of the song was to play the naughty parts over and over again. Lots of skanky dancing, possible sex on the dance floor. Old people humping. What the hell is this place?\\n\\n#4, the door policy. Expect lines at the door, like this is some exclusive trendy NYC club. It's so not. I waited in line for 25 minutes the first time I came here. And it was not so warm out. Lame. Then when you get up to the door, you are inspected by the bouncers. Do you look dressed up enough? Are you pretty? Do you have money? Good, fork over $10 a person just to get inside. Yes, we paid that much to get in. Thank goodness I wasn't paying. And yes, I did see them turn away people at the door who didn't make the cut, although I have no idea what those requirements were. The guys we were with were wearing dress pants and jackets and they were fine, just don't expect to get in here wearing jeans.\\n\\nAnd #5. The prices. $8 for a simple whiskey and coke. Boy was I glad I wasn't paying and my date was. But at those prices, I sure felt guilty for ordering drinks, so I tried to keep it light. Is there any reason for the drinks to be that expensive? Not really. They were a little strong, but I could get the same thing at Rumba's happy hour for $1.50. I will never come here and spend my own money, that's for sure.\\n\\nI do like some things about BoMA. It's in an old church. The building is remarkably beautiful, although I feel like such a sinner coming in here drinking watching people grinding on the dance floor and up where the alter should be. I'm not the most religious person, but I felt so dirty and wrong here. I felt like I needed to go to real church and beg forgiveness in the morning. If you do come here, make sure you take the time to walk around and explore. There is some unique art and gorgeous stained-glass windows. That is why I'm giving them two stars - the place is just too pretty.\\n\\nNow that I know that I could come here during the daylight and see all the architecture and art in the daylight I might, but if the nighttime club prices are any indication, I probably can't afford it. But maybe if I'm on another date..."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really wanted to love this place, but it didn't meet my standard to what Indian food should taste like.

I'm sure the food here caters toward the crowd that don't care for the intensity of the spices. And if you're that type of person, Clay Pit will work for you. It's lite on the palate to the point that'll you'll be well pleased. If you're on the other side of the spectrum where you love spicy authentic Indian, than be prepared for disappointment.

They are reasonably priced and usually have a deal going on where you can get a decent lunch $5 or $6. And lastly, they are quick. I can be in and out in less than 5 minutes.\\n\\nThe hate part is that it's fast food, generic, unimaginative, blah.  In the past, I worked a job were there were only 3 options for lunch in the area.  Subway was one of them.  After a few months of eating Subway a couple of times a week, I really burned out on the menu. I don't know how Jered did it.\\n\\nThat said, in the past few years they have made some improvements and added more stuff to their menu.  They started offering to toast the bread a la Quiznos.  That was a HUGE improvement.  There is nothing worse than a soggy sub sandwich.   They started offering more exotic options like pulled pork, cheesesteak, and several types of chicken.   A bunch of new kinds of bread were added to the menu. This went a long way to make the place appealing to me again. \\n\\nI tried the Buffalo Chicken today, one of the new (er) options, on the 9 grain honey wheat bread.  The chicken comes pre-sauced so after adding the veggies, (spinach, onions, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes and olives) I opted for the ranch dressing.  I figured it would complement the spicy hot Buffalo sauce. It turned out great.  All the ingredients were fresh, the chicken had a nice tangy spice to it and the ranch added a creamy coolness that topped it off.  Pretty damn good for fast food.\\n\\nService was quick and efficient as always.  The staff at this location actually seemed to be enjoying themselves.  The guy making my sandwich was careful to make sure the veggies were spread evenly across the sandwich so I got all the flavors with each bite, Sandwich Artiste indeed. \\n\\nThe bottom line:\\n\\nService: **** Quick and friendly\\nFood:  ***.5 Fresh and tasty\\nPrice: *** Good\\nAmbiance: Not rated, order to go.\\n\\n3.5 up to 4.\\n\\nDisclaimer:  Normally I wouldn't rate a fast food place this high but the friendly service here really made the difference.

Just a heads up, the drive to Andiamo is through one of the least scenic areas of town. It's literally a bunch of industrial buildings and then out of nowhere a strip mall. Inside of that strip mall, a gem of a restaurant.\\n\\nEnter Andiamo and you're greeted immediately. We did not make a reservation on a Friday night, which was a MISTAKE. We waited about 40 minutes before we could get sat, which was unfortunate, but our mistake. If you make reservations and they don't have you sat they comp a glass of champagne.\\n\\nThe interior design is pretty interesting. The lighting was a bit too bright for my liking. There are a bunch of beautiful photos of Italy. And then you look around and notice that there is drop tile ceilings, etc. It's really fairly lackluster. That's the only reason why I didn't give Andiamo 5 stars.\\n\\nWhile the food was amazing (I'll get to that in a bit), the highlight of the night was the people watching. While we waited a couple and there son came in - the wife clearly had imbibed or maybe ingested a cocktail of ludes. I swear she almost fell out of her chair and was slurring her words like crazy. Enter couple two - wearing hoodies. Guys, the cheapest plate here is probably $18. Not really a hoody and sweats type of restaurant. However, the best was the two uniformed cops who showed up for dinner. I sh** you not! They had dinner and dessert (unfortunately, did not share) and then packed it up and headed out.\\n\\nWe were served by Fabio, which is perhaps the perfect name for an Italian waiter in an Italian restaurant. He was attentive and had great recommendations, but interestingly didn't ask if we wanted a second glass of wine. Not a big deal, but we both noticed it. We were given some freshly baked cheesy bread and some oil with grated cheese. Both were delicious.\\n\\nWe sat directly across from a live \\"band.\\" I put band in quotes because there were only two members: a mandolin player and an accordion player. They were great! Because of where we were seated though it was a bit odd to look at the band because everytime I looked that way I made direct eye contact with the accordion player. It was like he was staring into my soul. I hope he was just staring at the mandolin player and he didn't just have the hots for me, ha.\\n\\nFor an entree I ordered the home made mushroom and cheese raviolis. They were amazing - some of the best raviolis I have ever eaten (and I've eaten my fair share of Italian food). The ladyfriend had some wild boar sausage, which I'm sure she will detail in her review. We also shared an amazing polenta appetizer, which was glorious. And, topped it off with Bocconoti, apple stuffed raviolis on some sort of creamy sauce. It was a thing of beauty.\\n\\nDefinitely check out Andiamo!"},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Omg this place is good!

Nutritionally, teff flour is far and away better than any wheat (rice, etc) flour; it is high in dietary fiber, iron, protein, calcium, and actually does not serve simply to expand and fill you up, as might the wheat-based injera served at some other restaurants (which shall remain nameless).

The waiter earned his 15% as I figured he probably had to tip out a whole lot of hostesses, bartenders and other helpers.

Turns out it doesn't open for dinner until 5:30, so we hung out in Starbucks across the street for a bit and then headed over.  We were seated by a very sweet server who was happy to translate the menu for us and give us some good suggestions.  My friend had a salad and I the arepas, which for me constituted a whole meal.  We both enjoyed our meals, but neither were out of this world.  They were very good, however.  We were quite caught up in our conversation because we had not seen each other in so long but after an hour and ten minutes, some guy came over, apologized, and asked us to leave because they were busy.  I get that, but it still felt pretty offputting.  I have never actually been kicked out of a restaurant!  (Bars, yes--but that was back in college and I like to forget that.!)  We had already paid our bill but were still talking a bit afterwards and we did tip generously.

They've always said: \\"Never judge a book by its cover\\", but regardless, I always did. Whether it be people, books, businesses or anything else, I have always tried to analyze all things before I had truly experienced it or acquainted myself with it. \\n\\nI've known about Santarpio's as far back as I can remember. Spending the first year or two of my life in East Boston, I built a connection with the town and even after my family moved away, I always returned. Whether it be for the dentist or to drive off to the airport, the man on Santarpio's sign always glared at me, smiling all while telling me to come in and have some pizza. Unfortunately, the outside of the building was always intimidating. Resembling a combination of a warehouse and a broken-down apartment, there was no way the food there was any good, right?\\n\\nWrong. Oh so very wrong.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The sun was shining and the breeze was cool. My sister who had come to visit me from Texas was disappointed in her visit to Boston so far. She'd lived here the majority of her life, but returning to Boston never created any excitement for her. Even so, she had made a list of people to see and things to eat before returning home to the sunny, blazing heat of Texas where quantity was everything, yet quality was quite blatantly lacking.\\n\\n\\"I have to see my friends tonight and all tomorrow, but before I go home on Tuesday, we have to get some pizza. Texas pizza sucks. The cheese practically disappears and melts in your mouth and the sauce is nonexistent.\\" she said. \\"We have to get the best pizza anywhere. Find a place and we'll go.\\"\\n\\nImmediately, Yelp came into play. My brother suggested Santarpio's, but by now, I knew the true reputation of Santarpio's and did not hesitate for a moment. Santarpio's it was.\\n\\nAs we entered, I was extremely shocked. From the outside, Santarpio's looked ridiculously small and puny and I had always imagined that it was just enough for two small tables and maybe a counter. Boy, was I wrong! As soon as I walked past the two doors, the heat of a roaring fire slapped my face, waking me and as my vision cleared, my eyes quickly focused on a spit of lamb, sizzling away on the fire, hissing at me to come forth and have some.\\n\\nWe were quickly ushered to a booth in a second room and promptly handed menus by a nice server who could tell we were newcomers. We ordered two plates of the sausage and lamb combo, a cheese pizza and one with the works, half with and half without anchovies. Our drinks and lamb and sausage came promptly. Hungry, we devoured the dishes. Served with a wedge of fresh, soft Italian bread and a couple, tart peppers, they complimented the tender meats well. Juicy and succulent, we sopped up the last bits of juice right when the pizzas came.\\n\\nI have always believed that a true pizza test is best with cheese pizza and based on Santarpio's, I'd say it's one of the best pizza's I've ever had. It was cheesy enough to string out for inches, yet crispy enough to be held with one hand with crunches in every bite. The sauce was delectably sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The works was equally good, topped with onions, perfectly seasoned and homemade hunks of sausage and chunks of coarsely chopped garlic, sweet after being baked in with the pizza. Plenty of sweet green peppers, mushrooms and gigantic slices of pepperoni enveloped the pizza with bites of anchovies perfectly situated in just the right spots. Though amazingly good, the works just didn't live up to the plain cheese pizza. There was something about how delicious the plain cheese pizza was that I can't quite pinpoint.\\n\\nMany have talked about service, but that's the last thing I thought of while being there. All I cared about was the food, the food and the food and nothing else. Whatever asked for was prompt and quick and there were little problems.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say this was one of the best experiences I've had in terms of pizza. It was a shame I waited so long to get Santarpio's, but now that I've had it, it's addicting. I am tempted daily to rush out on the T and buy a pizza to devour on my own quietly. It seems that I have another reason to come out to East Boston once again."},{"name":"Rafiki Bistro","address":"1682 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been soooo looking forward to the opening of Rafiki.

Needless to say, the boyfriend and I knew where to go for brunch this morning.\\n\\nThe place is aesthetically pleasing. We got free coffee with endless refills. Pretty cool. I saved a waitress who was filling a coffee jug and forgot about it. A little sad, but funny.\\n\\nThen it just got sad... not in the funny way. We arrived at 11:15. Breakfast ends at 11. They could have stretched it for us, but we decided lunch made more sense. Big mistake.\\n\\nWe ordered right after getting our coffee, and received our food at 12:00. They were apparently busy \\"switching over from the breakfast to lunch menu\\". Don't know how these things normally work, but... a 45 minute wait for two hot sandwiches and sweet potato fries, with 5 people in the restaurant?\\n\\nThe wait was far from worth it. I ordered the rosemary chicken \\"burger\\" (secretly a panini) with havarti, caramelized onions, aioli, tomato, and lettuce. First of all, I'm pretty sure the havarti and aioli was just... missing.  Second, it was an ocean of grease. The bread became saturated. I destroyed my cloth napkin, and felt like a pig. Maybe with the aformentioned ingredients, that's a risk I took. But my boyfriend's maple turkey burger was the same exact way, except the bottom bun was grease-soaked from the start.\\n\\nAnd the sweet potato fries... oh god. They were on the bf's plate even though I ordered them / it was understood that we wanted to share, but whatever. I can get past that. The special spice blend tasted awkward and bland. They were soggy as hell, and also in an ocean of grease. Me, disappointed by sweet potato fries? What planet are we on? Blasphemy.\\n\\nEven besides the grease, the food wasn't great. I expected so much better, with all the hype. Thank god our bill didn't go over $20. Still, $10 and 45 minutes for a sandwich like that. \\n\\nUnless I hear word of big improvement, I probably won't go back. If I do, it won't be for lunch.

I have seen the reviews, I have also known that everytime a restaurant opens at this location... it seems to disappear quite quickly. Since it was so upwardly positive I might as well come and see what it's all about and put my two cents in. If you know the place where it is at, it's like a small plaza, with a Taiwanese beef noodle joint next door that has seem to be there forever. Other than that, there really is no competition for this type of food if you are in this area, unless you want to eat at a Starbucks or take Japanese, but nothing close to what the name says about the place, this is Shanghainese food.\\n\\nComing in around 2pm on Sunday, it's considered late for lunch... later, and it was raining, and this place had no one there, I don't mind, a nice quiet time to enjoy the food and notice everything about a place. The place is actually not that small once you enter, some good seating and we were placed in a booth and presented menu's. They have lunch specials, stuff that I do not see at a Shanghainese place, but more of joints that go under my 'congee, fried rice, and noodle' restaurants. I was here for what was in the name and went to their 'dim-sum' section and was surprised how little they had, sure enough, I still confidently ordered their XLB, pan fried sticky rice cake, and their sticky rice wrap (Á≥ØÁ±≥ÔøΩ?. The last one really made me puzzled as isn't this like Cantonese dim sum fodder? So while the order was put in, I heard the fire and the wok go with a blaze, like creating background music in a place where background music was non-existent.\\n\\nThey gave us some complimentary soup to start, and then the first dish came, which was the pan fried sticky rice cake. I found this dish done quite well, where you wouldn't try to cook this at home cause you don't have enough fire to get this from not sticking (clumping) together. A good balance of rice cake with vegetables, meat and not over sauced or over salted, this was a good start to the meal, and if you were eating this on your own... you wouldn't need anything else, no wonder it's on the lunch special. We didn't plow through this as we wanted to eat the other dishes coming, but a good start to the meal.\\n\\nThe next one coming was the XLB and this was a disappointment as they looked great, coming with hot steam flying into the air, and the anticipation of filled dumplings with soup, but this was really never to be. It's rare to see but each individual XLB is steamed over a piece of lettuce. The presentation was there, the bite was not, like eating a plain dumpling. I carefully bit in the side of one to extract what soup there was... and there was barely none, maybe I had one unlucky one, and all of them were like this. A little over-doughy where it wasn't the fine thinly precise wrappings needing doctor like skills to remove from the steamer, nope, just meat and wrapping here, the taste was ok, but missing the soup is a big thing.\\n\\nThe last dish was actually quite good, the sticky rice wrap (Á≥ØÁ±≥ÔøΩ? which in one order comes in two small nicely wrapped lotus leaf parcels. When opening these up, you can see the glutinous forms of each rice bit, but still not mushy, but nicely separated by each bite. The meat was finely cut up where there was no dominant chunk, like a find grind, the only thing missing that would have made this even better was a little piece of duck egg yolk like all the other places are doing, but this was more a traditionalist style sticky rice wrap.\\n\\nThe people here are really nice, and guessing from what I saw it probably is a husband and wife couple running this joint. It's a nice place to sit around if you are around the area, tons of parking on the small streets, as Oak can get busy with parking restrictions. The menu is pretty vast for this place but I just wished it concentrated more on the Shanghainese cuisine instead of the regular fare you find at other Chinese restaurants.

Everything from the atmosphere to the broth and noodles were excellent and I decided to order \\"kaedama\\" (extra noodles) to keep the good vibes going. This is unfortunately where things stumbled a little, however. The kitchen took longer than expected with the refill and rather than just getting extra noodles to add, I received a second bowl (without chashu or toppings, obviously) to replace the first. Although I appreciated that thus meant I had another round of piping hot broth to enjoy, it also meant that I couldn't continue to enjoy the more complex flavors of my first bowl which had all of the extra drippings from the meat, egg yolks, etc. I'd absolutely go again regardless: the ramen is just too good to pass up."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I can't say I've had any Turkish food in the past so trying this place was a shot in the dark.

I love Ormbsy's so I was hoping to get the same feel here. I would consider The Painted Pin a more upscale version of Ormsby's. I would say that The Painted Pin is where you go with a bigger group of friends than Ormsby's because of how large and open the space is at The Painted Pin. At The Painted Pin, there are lots of comfy single couches and shared couches that can be shared with multiple groups, four booths along the walls, twenty full bowling lanes with couches and tables (very close knit space between lanes), several TVs scattered around the entire place, two ping pong tables, and two basketball hoop games. There is also a small area that people can dance. You don't need to \\"reserve\\" a table/couch to sit on. If they are free, you can sit in that area. There is a live band that plays music. The floors are all wood. There are several sectioned areas throughout the establishment. For the two hours we were there, we played the ring on the string/bimimi ring game, darts, and mainly Ping Pong. They need more Ping Pong balls! We didn't bother to sign up to bowl since I heard that the wait is ridiculous and it looks that way too. I don't think the dress code is strict here which is great. Some friends were able to come in wearing jeans and sneakers. \\n\\nFOOD:\\nFor the two hours we were there, we ordered Pin Fries, two Stella Artois, and other mixed drinks. All the food is moderately priced. The Pin Fries are shareable as it comes in a large bowl. The Pin Fries comes with a pesto aioli dipping sauce. I think they need to offer a larger container of the sauce as it is not enough the amount of fries you get. The fries are crispy and not soggy which is always a plus. Next time, I would like to try their Loaded Fries which is topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, cream, and scallion. \\n\\nPARKING:\\nI don't like the parking situation here. You really don't have much of an option other than to do valet. The other (not advisable) option is to park along the street/sidewalks and in other buildings, but not sure if you will get ticketed/fined. The valet parking is cheap and it's only $2 without tip. There is a massisve waiting line for car pickup from valet after the establishment closes. The valet employees run all over Miami Circle to get the cars so who knows how long it will take before they come back with your car.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great spot to chill with friends and I am excited to return in the future.

I didn't try the bread because I wanted to save room for my entree, but my husband enjoyed it even though the breadsticks were a little burned. We also ordered salads--I had the instalata mista, my husband had the Ceasar (dressed with Romano cheese). The salads were generously portioned and delicious--well-dressed, crisp, and fresh. The fried calamari was also good, although it cooled rather quickly because our salads came out at roughly the same time. We had barely finished our salads and calamari when our entrees came out. Since it was a Friday in Lent, we both went for seafood--my husband had shrimp and angel hair with pomodoro sauce, and I had mushroom ravioli. As many reviewers pointed out, the portions are not huge; however, with a salad and appetizer, we were quite full when we finished. The pasta was excellent--my ravioli was flavorful and the cream sauce was rich without being overly heavy. I tried my husband's pasta and got a piece of fresh thyme with it. In summary, we had a great experience with the food, the speed of service, and our reservation being honored on a prime date night.

The building is brownstone-brick and the first thing you'll see is a green awning with tables for the exterior seating. I parked at the edge of the Costco parking lot and crossed Brookhaven Ave and walked in - basically it was love at first sight.\\n\\nThe movement towards the gastropub in the US, I think coincided with the expansion of craft beers - the kids who most appreciated the \\"art of beer\\" wanted something more than a greasy chicken-finger to accompany the higher quality beers that are now available. From this was born the gastropub (basically a portmanteau of gastronomy and pub) currently sweeping the nation. The gastropub There is no exception in regards to this latest and fine obsession with fine beers and upscale foods.\\n\\nWalking through the front door the first thing you see is the bar - what else? There are tables along the walls and the aforementioned exterior seating - all very homey and pub-like. I arrived around 1:00 PM-ish and originally picked out There as a brunch spot (this was a Sunday) - most of the crowd had already departed so there were only people at about half the tables - I chose to sit at the bar and had a very pleasant conversation with Bill tending bar - it started with a discussion of the menu and naturally gravitated towards the beer - I noticed a lot of Monday Night Brewing taps - and immediately went with the Coffee Imperial IPA - something I hadn't yet tried. It was delicious and I was responsible for demolishing several pints.\\n\\nDue to my change of plans (I don't drink beer with breakfast foods - the best laid plans and all that), I started looking over the other menu items - quite a bit to digest there (sorry about the puns). I settled on the Seared Pork Belly with fresh Kimchi and Cascabel sauce.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this dish as it reminded me of  Sam-Gyup-Sal (inverted wok pork-belly - if you haven't tried Honey Pig in Duluth you're missing out). The pork-belly was on the edge of crispy with a fair bit of caramelization topped with \\"kimchee\\" - in all quite good and worth ordering. My only thought and something I voiced to Bill Brown when he asked how I liked it was that the kimchee could use a bit more fermentation. I told him that even a week of exposure would give it a bit of fermentation and improve the acid, something that the fat needed in my opinion and he seemed receptive to the idea (I usually hate to give this type of feedback but will if asked)\\n\\nFor an entr√©e I ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich - blue claw crab with fresh poblano slaw. This was also quite good and could use a little punch in my opinion (I like a stronger contrast in flavors than most - I think most of you would find it just fine) - next time I'll order a side of spicy mustard or a remoulade if they have it. Not that I would slather the sandwich with it, but it's nice to have something vinegary with the richness of the crab.\\n\\nSome other selections that looked interesting: Smoked Salmon wrapped shrimp with red beans and rice; There burger - grass fed beef, saut√©ed onion and poblano pepper; Roasted Duck Leg with braised turnip greens and butternut squash puree; Garlic Rosemary fries.\\n\\nI think I spent about an hour in the pub (live jazz!) and thoroughly enjoyed myself.

We had the chicken and ribeye tacos, both seemed to have a special seasoning not to our liking perhaps curry like. Furthermore, the atmosphere was more targeted to drinkers and not food enthusiasts . There was a lot of flies and gnats roaming around the establishment, understandable due to the summer weather. I will not visit again because our bill for two people was $56 without tip.

I was sold. And, I'm glad I was. A true homey/intimate feel to the place, tucked away in a shopping center so you can barely see it. We walked in and they were waiting to seat us and I'm SO glad we had a reservation as it was packed. We started with the Bruschetta Ibarra and Insalata di Finocchio - some nice twists on some Italian classics. I went for the Fettuccine al Ragu Napoletano and basically licked my plate clean. My Mom went for the Ravioli di Zucca and my Dad went for the Lingune ai Frutti di Mare and both had zero complaints, also cleaning their plates. The portions were filling, but not overwhelming. The service was spot on...attentive, answered our questions, water glasses were never left too empty, and the cheesy garlic bread was flowing (and it is good stuff!).

That makes sense.  For the love of Jebus, who needs gyozas when butter corn ramen is about to be sat in front of you?!?  The gyozas were pretty damn good though.

My friend Bailey came into town and he wanted to give this \\"dim sum\\" place a shot because it got rave reviews from a few food critics. However, anytime I hear anything about \\"Asian Fusion,\\" I get a bit nervous. Nevertheless, we took a chance and boy did we pay the price.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there were hipsters EVERYWHERE!!! Ok, so they weren't quite hipsters, but close enough. I tried to remain optimistic, but then I got the menu. WTF!?!? First of all, the price for each dish was through the roof. Second of all, there wasn't much to choose from. Third, there was NOTHING on the menu that remotely resembled any dish from any authentic Dim Sum restaurant. \\n\\nHow did we order?  We just chose whatever was recommended on Yelp. The first dish came (some Dan Dan noodle crap)...I paid like $10 for 10 pieces of noodles drenched in peanut butter, served in a Chinese to-go box. We were like \\"ehh.\\" Then came the calamari (cold, stale-tasting...nothing special). We were like \\"ugghhh.\\" Then came the pork belly buns (Momofuku's is WAYYY better). We were like \\"our parents would slap us.\\" Then came the mushroom potstickers (mushrooms were nowhere to be found and it was pretty tasteless...could only taste the soy sauce that I dipped it in). We were like \\"let's eat somewhere else after this.\\" Then came the tea-smoked ribs, which I'm pretty sure they marinaded in straight up salt. We were like \\"let's get the F*** out of here.\\" \\n\\nSo, why did this place get 2 stars as opposed to 1? Well, the service was on point and their real saving grace was the lychee-vanilla soda I had, which contained bits of real fruit. \\n\\nBottom line, I wouldn't be caught dead here ever again.

Jen (I believe) and the Cook / Owner both took considerable time to share their insight and offer more than enough ideas to fill my short trip.  I appreciated the time they took, it meant a bunch.\\n\\nNo about the food.  Brisket that was melt in your mouth delicious and cooked to perfection.  Creative potato side to accompany the sausage, expertly cooked eggs and pickled jalapenos.  They also had a mean coffee BBQ sauce that had a nice mix of flavors and a tasty compliment to the meal.\\n\\nIt was so good I went back a second time on the last day of my trip.  I had to have more brisket, it was that good AND I needed to try some new things.  Well that was my justification.  I tried the Cheeky Monkey because I had to.  I looked and sounded far too good not to try it.  I was hesitant with the sage gravy but was pleasantly surprised at the subtle flavor.  The six minute egg was a bit cool from refrigeration but that is understandable.  Each bit started with the crisp of the exterior to juicy sausage followed by the creaminess of the yolk.

The steak in my Regal Regis was good and all, but it was definitely not that special. I thought my friends Nebo was nice and refreshing with tuna and vegetable, but honestly it's something we could have whip up at home. The chicken sandwich tasted really good, but the problem is that I don't see any originality/creativity in it.

Our server was really nice when the entire lunch crew declared that none of us have been here. She explained to us the ordering process, which is similar to Mary Mac's Tea Room where you write down what you want to order and then the server comes and collects the sheets. \\n\\nThey have a great lunch special that includes three tacos of your choice plus a side salad. Otherwise, you order a la carte. Each taco is about $3 - $4 dollars. They also serve rice bowls, salads, and traditional Mexican tamales. Both of my co-workers got the lunch special and I opted for one Veracruz taco and one pork tamale. Apparently, the kitchen made a mistake and I also got a chicken taco on the house. I can't say no to a free taco!\\n\\nMy biggest quip about service was food came out as it was ready. I can understand that this ensures that everything you order stays warm, but it's also awkward when there is such lag between service. The only time I have seen food not come out at once is at family style Chinese restaurants. I received the pork tamale first, then it was at least 15 minutes before anyone received any tacos. Then, we were informed that the Baja fish tacos that my two co-workers ordered were coming right up. But in fact, there was at least another 15 minute delay before those arrived as well.\\n\\nI'm not generally a fan of tamales but then again, I've only had the frozen kind at Trader Joes. The pork tamale was tasty think but a little bland. I really liked the little kernels of corn inside. It gave it a slightly sweet flavor. The Veracruz taco is a grilled perch with Mexican seasoning and a jicama slaw. First off, I LOVE jicama. It, as well as the red pepper, added a great crunch to the soft fish. White fish, I find, is often under seasoned because it is so bland by itself. However, this was really tasty. The chicken taco had some spicy chili sauce with cilantro and onions. I know Daniel B. said this was his least favorite taco, but I thought it was okay. The flavors in the chili sauce were bold, and I though the cilantro added a good bit of earthiness to it. The Baja taco was a huge disappointment for me. It was a breaded cod with a chipotle slaw. The fish itself was incredibly bland, to the point of tasting like paper and the slaw was okay. I think with some salt though, this could be a really good taco. The chef did an excellent job with the frying part. The breading was light and didn't feel greasy, or weigh down your palette.\\n\\nBartaco is fairly priced and there is complimentary valet. Since I've just moved to the area, I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their tacos; maybe not during peak hours though since it seems that they still aren't able to handle the lunch rush."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Flip is located on the horribly trafficked corridor that is Howell Mill Road.

They come out fairly quickly and the taste is fantastic. The burger is cooked medium, it's juicy and the seasonings are just right. Sure, to look at it's smallish, but it filled me up.

After reading some works from my favorite reviewers, my decision was made easy as they described some of my favorite things. Small plates. Wood-fired grill. Beer & wine parings. Memorable dishes. Excellent service. So Rachel and I were off to Barley Swine for our second visit. Or perhaps I should say adventure! \\nWhy 'adventure' you ask? Because their menu ALWAYS seems to get us to drift from the 'norm' and try some things that are not considered 'main stream' by our fairly conservative standards. We both like that about BS.\\n\\nWe arrived at 6:05PM on a Saturday. After perusing the menu during our 10 minute wait, we decided that seats at the bar would work just fine. \\nAs Ashley aptly noted, there is something special about dining in a place where people clearly LOVE working there. You see it. You feel it. At Barley Swine, you can also taste it. It is all around you. To a degree you absorb it = it becomes part of your experience. :-) \\nFrom our vantage point at the bar, we really got a sense of some of the subtle touches that I feel make Barley Swine something special; \\n- the waitress raises a glass to ensure it is not spotted before she uses it for serving, \\n- the bartendress talked about insisting that her boss call her in on her day off when for beer tastings were scheduled, \\n- the cooks meticulously prepare each dish from parsing out the sauces to balancing each tower of food items before declaring them ready to serve, \\n- waiters touches up each bowl before delivering them to patrons, \\n- the maitre d' engages with folks as they come and go, usually getting some tidbits from their experience as they are leaving, \\n\\nOn this visit, Billy was our server and she doubled as the bartender. She was cute with a bright smile and an engaging personality. \\n\\nWe both agreed that four of the six plates we ordered were our favorites of the night, as the flavors of each ingredient combined to give you a forkful of flavor that really did make you wonder how they put together these wonderful and inventive combinations! Our top 3 faves beginning with the best were; \\n- Foie gras, grilled pork belly, goat cheese grits, watermelon ($16) \\n- Maple syrup barbecued pork cheek with sweet potatoes, apples, and chili pecan sauce ($11), \\n- Grilled beef tongue with popcorn puree and cheddar glazed potato ($10), \\n\\nWe hung out, we noshed, we drank and generally chilled for ~2ish hours.

The pot is covered, and on the side is a dish of soy sauce for you to pour in and allow it to bake some more to get a mix of salty saucy goodness. When I opened the pot, a puff of steam rised and I was welcomed to a sight of greens piled in the center. Along the sides were nicely cut up Chinese sausage pieces, and right in the middle was 'meatcake'. This thing was almost the entire top surface of the pot, hiding the bright white rice lying below. Seeing all this food in it's glory I poured in the side of soy sauce and closed the lid.\\n\\nI enjoyed everything about my meal, but something wasn't there, maybe it was the 'meatcake' that didn't wow me like the first time, maybe it was the combination of the meats. I felt that it wasn't as hot out of the pot as when I had it last time, and also elsewhere. The meat was a little over dominant to the portions of the pot, it was thick, and very hard to break apart, with the thinly plastic spoon, and hard to snap apart with the chopsticks. They have to really think about replacing their spoons, cause it does bring down the experience as you are fighting with trying to peg off the crispy bits off the pot with this flimsy utensil and your not going to carry a metal spoon everywhere you go.\\n\\nIf you want to take it to go.... you would think why the hell would you want to, but here's the catch, you can, and with the pot.

I will be back, and hopefully the pot of rice I pick that day will wow me like the first time but this is still a solid pick for your claypot (or sandpot as they call it here) bowl of rice!

This place is one example. \\n\\nThe first time I came here, it was with a group of guys that I know after a Friday night of drinking some beers. A guy was craving for more food, and we ended up getting a pizza with pineapple slices on top. It was not a bad pizza, but it was definitely a mediocre pizza. The flavor of the crust was a little bland. \\n\\nThis place's specialty is actually not pizza, but cuisine from Spanish speaking countries in South America. I walked back in, and ordered a beef Chacarero, and a Empanada. A Chacarero is a sandwich originally from Chile, and it usually has meat, green beans and some sort of avocado sauce, somewhat similar to a Mexican Cemita. The bread of the Chacarero is actually excellent. It has a nice chewiness. The beef was juicy and had a pretty good flavor and was really tasty with the avocado sauce. The Chacarero is significantly better than the pizza they serve here. \\n\\nTheir Empanadas are not bad. An Empanada is a fried dough pastry with meat inside. I got a Beef Empanada and it has a nice crispiness on the outside with a little greasiness, and the beef had a hot and nice chewiness on the inside. If you add a little spice, it can make the Empanada tastier. I would say that a couple of Empanadas are definitely better than the pizza they serve here. \\n\\nThe interior definitely has this gritty look, and it gave me the feeling that I was not in Boston, but in the worst areas of the Bronx borough in New York. The people who run the place definitely have this demeanor that they do not like to get besmirched and one of the persons who work here has somewhat of a snide appearance. It is definitely one of the uncleanest places that serve food, but somehow they can keep the government inspectors happy. I guess to make your experience enjoyable, just order take away from this place and eat the food in the comfort of your own home. \\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for a great Chacarero or a decent Empanada, this is actually a great choice if you do not mind grittiness. I would not recommend this place to get pizza, as there are plenty of better pizza places in this neighborhood. Despite the look of this place, this place is one possible example to find some deliciousness in grittiness."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Cafe Medina, definitely a cool local gem to hang out for breakfast!

I think regulars have grown accustomed to or overlook these concerns, but there are real problems here.  First, the physical condition of place...  The manager was in constant circulation dabbing condensation off the ceiling air ducts so it wouldn't drip on customers' heads and in their food.  The rancid odor in the bar area points to the need to clean dirty draft beer and/or CO2 lines.  And for the sake of decency, I'll just say the restroom was not welcoming.\\n\\nNext issue is the service.  Yes, it's like homecoming there - wait staff and patrons seem to all know each other's names.  Honestly, I'd prefer an anonymous server if my food wouldn't come out cold or something didn't get left off the order.  We had a table of 6 and the first meal on the table was finished before the last meal arrived.  All issues try to get covered-over by backslapping and overly friendly servers.  Not sure if it's the kitchen or the servers at fault, but less personality and more professionalism would be a huge improvement.\\n\\nFinally, the food.  I've had every item on the menu at least 2x and probably every special.  In general, the food is bland and salty but lots of people like bland and salty.  Of the 6 entrees ordered at our table, 4 were simply not good. Like the Bison Burger requested medium rare - was served well done and dry and cold.  Sent back and got the same again but warmer.

From the minute we walked in, I had a bad feeling about how the evening would unfold. The restaurant was empty, save for a few tables, and the hostess was nowhere to be found. Once the three of us were seated at our table, we received a lifeless greeting from one of the servers, but no introduction to the food concept or the restaurant to really set the stage for the experience. Restaurants of this caliber typically give diners the welcome \\"spiel\\"; as we were first time patrons, this type of introduction would have also helped to foster a friendly rapport between us and the servers. We were offered absolutely nothing in that regard from our server except a \\"can I take your order?\\" WHAT? You have the nerve to charge $36 for a schnitzel and we don't get so much as an explanation of the menu or anything? Go to any other high end restaurant in Vancouver - Anna Lena, St. Lawrence, Hawksworth, etc. - and you are greeted with passionate, engaged and knowlegable PROFESSIONALS who CARE about the dining experience because we are spending our HARD EARNED DOLLARS to be there! \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, and when our glasses were empty, no one came around to refill them. We proceeded to fill our own glasses for the remainder of the evening; our server saw us do so and did NOTHING. If I want to refill my own glass of champagne, I can go to the nearest BC liquor store and purchase the same bottle for a third of the price, and have a better time on my couch than at this scam of an establishment. It was this and other hospitality 'fails' throughout the evening that proved to me that there was no one on staff managing front of house operations. This person should have their eyes and ears on every table (and I mean, there were only three tables to keep an eye on) to ensure glasses are filled, plates are cleared and patrons are HAPPY. We were not happy. If the restaurant was busy, that would be one thing - but I literally saw most of the serving staff chatting by the bar when they should have been putting a modicum of effort into, oh, I don't know - doing their jobs?!?!?!\\n\\nThere isn't really much to say about the food because it just wasn't good. We ordered nearly everything on the menu. The value for money actually makes me want to cry just thinking about it. If pressed to say something nice about the food, I would say that the sp√§tzle (in this case, glorified mac and cheese) was palatable. On second thought, the best bite was actually the amuse bouche, and then it pretty much went downhill from there. The coating on the schnitzel (did I mention it was $36!?) didn't adhere to the meat and fell off in sad, scrappy pieces. \\n\\nIt is a true disappointment when restaurants charge top dollar but don't put in the WORK to earn it. Did you not expect me to notice that your staff phoned it in for the whole night? Isn't that embarrassing? Did your eyes not glance across the street and notice the full house at Di Beppe? On a Wednesday? Isn't that embarrassing? I'm making a mockery of you because you made a mockery of me for thinking that you could treat me and my friends like the gum you found at the bottom of your shoe.\\n\\nI've already put more effort into this review than you did on our entire experience that night. So I'm gonna wrap this up.\\n\\nMy only regret - besides fooling myself into thinking I was going to do some \\"fine dining\\"- was tipping 12% for a place that should have paid ME to be there.

We visited one in California for drinks once and it was also a jazz club.  Big Fan.  I figured she knew I was not really hot on doing one here again so I thought she had another place in mind.  I made the mistake of saying I would like anything but fondue.  Oops. I guessed it and it did hurt her feelings.  I explained my apprehension because of the last time and she agreed it was not so great.  I told her that I would willingly go with an open mind and after some thought the plan was back on.\\n\\nWhen I walked in I knew this was so much better than the other place.  The atmosphere was more romantic.  The booths more private.  The servers very welcoming and they presented us with an anniversary card signed by the staff.

Since I had mine as take out, it's understandable that the dough gets a bit soggy. 10 minutes of the pizza trapped in the take-out bag will do that. So I wouldn't know if it would be crispy straight from the oven. But it still tastes great! To me, it's a bit pricey for pizza, but I definitely think it's worth the money.\\n\\nOnly bad thing is that it's cash only. There were definitely times where I wanted pizza from Santarpio's and I didn't have enough cash on me. So I would have to stop by an ATM first.

It has a slight cinnamon flavor followed by the typical Italian spices and a mild afterburn.

Thankfully, we had friends that insisted we eat here and so we finally made it in with a group of 6. \\n\\nFor starters, be prepared to wait. We got here and the line was just barely out the door, and it was probably 25 minutes before we'd ordered and were seated. It's not too big of a deal, the line goes straight past the bar, so you can grab a drink (hello Sweet Tea Vodka) and sip on it while you wait in line. But just be prepared for it. \\n\\nBecause the BF isn't a beefeater, we decided to split the Tuna Burger and it was SO yummy.

Thus, we paid for our stuff (most of which I didn't eat), left a 20% tip, and didn't give the business a chance to address the following in person, which doesn't feel fair, but I'm not sure what they could have done except comp our meal. \\n\\nSuffice to say, I really, really tried to enjoy my visit to Burnside Brewing, but there's a list of reasons why I'll never return and will discourage others from going as well. Inspired by the recent Mercury \\"Beer-Ed Science\\" review, my foodie partner and I stopped in on a sunny evening. We were enticed by the promise of molecular gastronomy inspired beer and food. Settling on a pitcher of honey-colored Belgian beer, we ordered three likely-sounding appetizers: seared foie gras over mushrooms, scallops with tapioca and sea beans, and the \\"cohiba\\" duck confit  in crispy crepe. [I read once that adding \\"crispy\\" to a menu item increases its popularity, perhaps this was the case here; to be fair, this item was the only edible one of the bunch. Not great--the duck was dry and more like jerky than reminiscent of slow-cooking in fatty oils--but my partner liked it well enough.] The other items were inedible. \\n\\nI think you have to work hard to screw up a scallop. I cook them often and a little salt goes a long way. These had no discernible taste. In addition, they were thinly sliced yet gelatinous, seriously slimy, and served with congealed tapioca in a pile. I had hope for the sea beans but they, too, lacked any flavor, and seemed overcooked. The schmear of oil adorning the plate offered nothing. I was open to its fluorescent sheen only because I was still imagining some \\"molecular gastronomy\\" going on behind the scenes. Not so much. This oil appeared on the foie gras plate, too. That dish was seriously disgusting. I spat my bite of mushroom back out, which I never do. The foie was flavorless and unappetizing in appearance, scent, and texture. It appeared to be the organ it is--without the blood or flavor.\\n\\nLike I said, I'm sad about this, because I heartily endorse many restaurants throughout this city, and I understand the challenges of starting a new eatery in Portland. To its credit, BB Co. has a charming motif of the \\"Hop Nymph\\" and requests patrons to invent its mythology. The space is large, with sunny exterior picnic area (good for kids), and tons of seating options inside. The bar is comfortable and friendly, and booths line the back wall beneath intriguing art. I also appreciate the wine options for those not going for the brewery portion of the restaurant. On that point, our otherwise friendly and competent server poured a head on my pint that filled the upper third. She apologized, but this IS a brewery, right? A second server scoffed when I inquired about the rumored food infusions into the beer. \\"Um, there's beer in our beer,\\" she retorted, with an attitude of WTF?! So much for trusting your local review. I'd say stick with pub fare if you wind up here (my neighbor's hanger steak looked decent, as did the fries), but don't expect that just because it's on the menu they can get it right. The kitchen is still struggling on the \\"fancy fare.\\" To my mind, don't offer it, or front like you're doing something special with either food or beer, especially if you don't inform your servers.

Inside, you'll find a cozy, colorful, and warmly decorated Ethiopian dining room with traditional handwoven mesob tables, perfect for a meal or sharing a pot of coffee. Ghion isn't as established or as big as Desta, which many consider to be the best Ethiopian restaurant in town. However, I think the food and service at Ghion is just as good, if not better, than Desta and it has among the best Ethiopian food I've tried anywhere.\\n\\nGhion has a small parking lot. If you can't find parking out front, you can park in the empty lot next door on the other side of the fence (not Blue Rat Smoke Shop, but the other side). If that lot eventually gets developed, Ghion may have some parking issues.\\n\\nThis place isn't very big. There are only 7-8 tables, most seating up to 4 customers comfortably each. They do have one table that seats 6, but I recommend coming with a small group or a date (this is a unique date spot). The soft fabric-covered chairs are comfortable. If you order food, the food will be placed atop your mesob table with drinks, napkins, and other stuff placed on side tables. If you order only coffee or tea, your drinks (coffee pot, cups) will be placed on the mesob table. Ghion uses jebenas which are traditional Ethiopian clay coffee pots with incense (you'll most likely smell the incense as you walk in).\\n\\nThe menu contains a good variety of Ethiopian cuisine, mainly beef, lamb, and vegetarian dishes. They also serve chicken and fish, though selections are limited. Most dishes cost about $12-15 each. Some examples include gored gored (seasoned cubed beef, served raw or cooked, $13), fir-fir (or fit-fit, marinated and seasoned injera, $12), yebeg alicha (mild lamb curry-spiced stew, $13), and shiro (seasoned and roasted chickpea stew, $10). Injera is the spongy, sourdough-like flatbread used in Ethiopian cuisine.\\n\\nBeverage-wise, they offer authentic Ethiopian coffee (Bunna), beer (e.g. Bedele, Hakim Stout, Meta), and wine (Gouder, Axumite). Coffee costs $5 for 2 people ($10 family size), beer $5 each, and wine $7 per glass or $23 per bottle.\\n\\nI recommend ordering the Ghion Cultural Special ($35). It's a combination platter that includes many different kinds of food, making deciding what to order simple and easy. The Ghion Cultural Special comes with a varied selection of assorted vegetables, kitfo (minced beef marinated in mitmita, a chili powder spice blend, and clarified butter; served raw or cooked), derek and awaze tibs (small cuts of beef seasoned, marinated, and cooked with various ingredients like garlic, onion, rosemary, tomato, jalapeno, berbere Ethiopian spice mix and other spices), and doro wot (chicken stewed with onion, garlic, and jalapeno) all served both over and with a side plate of injera.\\n\\nI think the special is fantastic. It's neatly and beautifully presented and all of the items are fresh and delicious. Our vegetables included a green salad, curried potatoes and carrots, collard greens, sauteed carrots and (I believe) green beans, and three different kinds of lentils (green, red-orange, and yellow). The doro wot stew is the centerpiece, featuring bone-in chicken, a hard-boiled egg, and succulent clumps of soft white cheese. My favorite item is probably the kitfo. It's kind of like eating rich and buttery ground beef. It's satisfyingly savory and flavorful. The tibs are more like eating sliced steak, somewhat reminiscent of carne asada (tougher). The doro wot uses tender, juicy dark meat chicken. Overall, the special is terrific and one I could order again and again. I'd go so far to say it's a must-try dish in Atlanta.\\n\\nThe special is ideal for about 4 people which works out to be less than $10 per person. This makes it a fine value. Even if there's less than 4 in your party, I still recommend ordering it. You can just take leftovers home and have something yummy to eat later. If you need an extra plate of injera, ask for one. They're complimentary. And yes, you have to eat with your hands. Grab a roll of injera, tear off a piece, and use it to wrap/pick up your food off the plate.\\n\\nService is friendly. It would be nice if the dining room had better air conditioning.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, Ghion Cultural Hall has a Yelp check-in offer that will take 20% off your total bill, making this restaurant even that much better of a value."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Family visiting from out of state?

This building was a general store and, to avoid arrest, fine gentleman who were \\"in the know\\" would shuffle down to the tunnel, run under the street to the general store, and pretend to be SHOPPING.  New code word... SHOPPING. The wives must have been delighted to be given a late night souvenir from the general store ... JUST THINKING OF YOU, HONEY.  Later, when all of the men were at war, they hired young women to tend the store.  \\n\\nRecently a 93 year old woman stopped in for dinner and said she had worked in the general store when she was 15.  She walked down the steps and took one look to the right and said, \\"THEY BLOCKED THE TUNNEL TO THE BROTHEL!\\" Apparently, the metal chains that were constructed into the arches were used for holding slaves.  AND, IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH, THEY SAY THAT THE PLACE IS HAUNTED AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL \\"SITINGS.\\" SEE WHY I FEEL NAUSEOUS?  \\n\\nI am NEVER eating in the \\"romantic\\" dungeon EVER AGAIN.  Phantasmagoric visions of whores, governmental johns, sad general store purchases, struggling slaves, and tons of stone crashing on my head is NOT my idea of ambiance, no matter how many tea candles you add to this picture.\\n\\nIf your head feels congested from some wicked seasonal allergies, just for fun, TRY WALKING DOWN STAIRS THAT SEEM TO DISAPPEAR TO NOWHERE.  Then deal with a 6'-2\\" ceiling, flat arches that separate the room into several intimate dining experiences, and candles in the niches.  Sound romantic?  Eat in the EFFING DUNGEON OF ROMANCE only if you are under the \\"kid height limit\\" at Disneyland and you have always wanted a candle lit dinner in a torture space that feels like it is slowly getting shorter.  SERIOUSLY, I THINK THERE IS AN OXYGEN SHORTAGE DOWN HERE.  I could not help but look at the flat arches of stone from the late 1800's and think that they were, at one time, full Roman arches.  THIS DID NOT REALLY HELP TO OVERRIDE THE CLAUSTROPHOBIA AND NAUSEA that I was feeling.  OMG, I think this entire building is lowering onto our table.  My Sweetie looks at me and says, \\"Are you alright? Your eyes look really small and they are watering.\\"  I excuse my self and when I stand up, nearly bang my head on the descending ceiling.\\n\\nChicken Korma mild for my sweetie and Chicken Korma medium for me.  We are boring and predictable in this way.  We have ordered this one meal well over a hundred times.  If you find yourself at the Clay Pit and you like chicken and a sweet, rich sauce and rice and you need an amazing meal to order, this is the one.  \\n\\nTHEY have tried to tell us many different lies about our Chicken Korma, but WE KNOW THE TRUTH.  THEY said that the Hot is the sweetest, followed by Medium and then Mild.  Bullshit: the Mild always tastes like dessert and the Hot is always hot.  This is a LIE made up to get us to order the HOT and then have to order the MILD for dessert.  That is too much Chicken Korma for one human to try and eat at one sitting.  \\n\\nTHEY said that this other \\"medallion\\" meal that is also made with the Korma sauce and mushrooms is somehow better than the Chicken Korma meal.  Bullshit:  both times that we \\"explored YOUR new horizons,\\" we were totally disappointed.  The chicken medallions were dry.  Please, server person, why must you try to talk us out of OUR meal?  Heck, we do not even open the menus.\\n\\nDO NOT DOUBT US. Just bring us what we ask for instead of asking us if we have tried the effing chicken medallion meal that I cannot pronounce nor remember. Rice should never be cold and hard and crunchy.  Likewise, it should never be cold and hard and crunchy. Naan should always be served HOT with the Chicken Korma.  Do NOT bring it out before the meal, it will get cold.  Do NOT bring it out after the meal, it is too late.  Bring it out WITH the meal, just right.  We are the assholes who actually look for this level of detail, and if the Naan is burned or cold or nonexistent, guess what, .20 x meal becomes .15 x meal.  YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS.  We are not joking around about timing this just right.  Think about some things in life in which timing means everything... yeah, that.  THIS IS THAT. TO US. \\n\\nOn a weekend night, you CAN make reservations.  This would be called a SMART MOVE by your date.  You can also hand the maitre de anything between a 5 and a 20 spot and move ahead in the line incredibly fast.  INCREDIBLY. The maitre de person does not get tipped by ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU.  Keep that in mind when you are calculating your date's patience and hunger.  Those of you who have wondered how the line really works here and who have ever asked if all of those people had reservations... THEY DIDN'T.

This was an extremely unique mix of flavors and textures with the crispy pop of greens mingled into the smooth avocado, salty salmon and caper cheese combo.\\n\\nDish #2: The Fricassee - two fried eggs on top of braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, watercress, caramelized onions and cheddar.

A napkin and straw, more water, you just put this card up and someone comes to your rescue however at some point I found it to be annoying because I'm one of those people that always need something and it's like raising your hand to go to the bathroom.

You've been once. The first time you got an attitude about an overestimated wait time on their opening. That doesn't make a lot of sense, but ok. Your other complaints from that night seemed worthy of complaints, but jeez, it was their opening, give them another shot.\\n\\nYou did, and they were too busy so you went elsewhere. So I don't think that counts. And then you did again, but they were closed. Don't you think it's fair to give a staff at one of the busiest restaurants in town a break? Or no they should just stay open, even though they were closing, to serve you and your friend, since you're previous customers. Dude you had been there once.\\n\\nI'm sorry but that doesn't make a bit of sense. If you were really giving them a \\"fair shot\\" you wouldn't post a one star review after dining their one time just because you were mad that they were too busy for you to wait in line (hint, maybe they are busy because they are good?) and then the next time they were closed. \\n\\nSpeaking from someone who dines there once a week (at least), I can tell you that FLIP has some of the most consistently delicious fries, onion rings, pickled veggies, caesar salads, shrimp po boygers (OMG, like crack), and last but not least, to-die-for nutella shakes that I've ever eaten.

One year got derailed by an injury, one by Tony Starlight and we just haven't gotten it together during the other years.\\n\\nBut this year, we finally made it happen.  And while it's probably not fair to judge a restaurant solely based on a fixed price meal on New Year's Eve, our food experience last night was so disappointing, I'm forced to do so.\\n\\nWe had three food choices for the evening:  Veal Chop, fish or NY Strip Steaks.  I'm not sure what vegetarians were supposed to do; fortunately all of us are meat eaters.  We all ordered the steak, two mediums, one medium well and one well done.  \\n\\nThree of us chose the Lobster Bisque for a starter and one chose the Mushroom Bread Pudding.  After our wait staff left to put in our order, he returned to tell us that the Lobster Bisque would now be Lobster and Crab Bisque (which tells me they ran low on the bisque and had to quickly make more without more lobster).  It wasn't bad - and did have a few small chunks of crab (couldn't identify any lobster).  My SO had the bread pudding which he says was very good.\\n\\nThen, the steaks were delivered.  The first thing I noticed was the steaks were bigger than I expected them to be.  The second thing was the NY strip steaks had a bone in them.  (So this is probably the time to say that I don't eat steak every week or even every month - and much of the time when I do have a steak, it will be a filet.  Still, I have had NY Strips before and all of them were deboned).  The third thing was that none of us had anything more knife-like than a butter knife, which we all dutifully picked up and began to saw on the meat, without much luck.  We asked for steak knives, and got what appeared to be butter knives with a sharp point - so maybe some kind of steak knife, but not one that made much headway on the meat.\\n\\nWhen I did manage to carve off a piece of my steak, it was full of gristle, dry and rather flavorless (no, I did not have the well-done steak).  It had no juice at all and no hint of pink.  The medium steaks likewise had no juice, though there was some pink to the meat.  All of the steaks at our table were full of gristle - there was no way to get even a nibble of meat without it.  \\n\\nOne of our party complained and was brought another steak (and a real steak knife this time) and it was the same.  Trying to pick through the meat to find something edible was so time-consuming, none of us gave much notice to the rather routine mashed potatoes and spoonful of mixed vegetables.\\n\\nAfter we told another server how bad our meat was, she summoned Adele (one of the owners) who came to the table.  When we told her our story, she said, \\"It's Carlton Farms - the best beef you can get\\", and then when our spokesperson told her it was full of gristle, she apologized and left.  Later, we found out she comped one dinner for our party.\\n\\nI suspect that our late seating (9:30pm) put us at the tail end of the food they had to serve for New Years.  Hence the lobster-crab bisque and what appeared to be the last five steaks that were sitting in the warmer for five hours.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the wait staff were very pleasant, the atmosphere was great and the music very good.  We had good drinks (Dirty Martini, Manhattan and Cosmopolitan) and a nice wine.\\n\\nOn the minus side - $70 per person is too much to pay for a cup of soup, a small piece of chocolate cake and a completely inedible piece of meat.  Even with the comped meal, our per person price came to $55/head which is still about $40 too much for what we got.\\n\\nI don't know if we'll venture into Wilf's again to see if they are better when not in New Year's mode.  I'd like to like them, but the complete lack of quality in the beef makes me think they are too willing to compromise quality and there are too many other great restaurants in Portland for me to compromise as well."},{"name":"Ava Roasteria","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 137","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"This review is for the new location at Timberland Town Center, Cedar Hills.

Ava, you should not call the puff pastry with cream a cannoli which is incorrect.  There is no ricotta, candied orange or chocolate chips in the cannoli.

Because it's a popular area, parking can be cramped. There's some paid lots nearby, but valet is also an option. I actually walked over here after parking for free in the Westside Provisions area, so that too.\\n\\nAmbiance: modern, hip, and laid back West Coast vibes here. The large garage doors opened up to let a cool breeze in. There's a decent amount of booths, a central bar, and then outdoor seating as well. \\n\\nFood: I kept it a light lunch by ordering just two tacos: fish and pork belly. They're small, you could probably eat 4-6 if you were really hungry. They both came in a soft tortilla. Boo also got a fish taco and a fried oyster one. We were both pretty pleased. Fish taco was good, but not the best I've had. However, the pork belly one was LEGIT! The sauce, the tenderness of the meat, the fattiness. It was all delicious! I can't see myself ever not ordering it if I come here. These are great deals for $2.50-$3.50 each. \\n\\nOther options on their menu include rice bowls with various meats, as well as Mexican-inspired bar staples like chips & guacamole.\\n\\nI saw some complaints that it's not \\"authentic\\" but I don't think that's what Bartaco is trying to be. They literally say on their website that the business is inspired by the beach culture of South America and California. And it's a goal they achieve perfectly.\\n\\nService: our server was friendly and attentive. They have a blue car system that you can put up when you want service. Response time was quick.

It's reminiscent of a NY gastropub... or a late night chef hangout.  Either way, I can see how the communal seating and elbow-rubbingness of it all could be a lot for an Austinite to grasp at first.  :)\\n\\nMy biggest complaint would be the inconsistency of the plate sizes.  My friend (let's called her Naynay) and I rolled in on a freezing cold night (hence, no wait for seats... one plus about living with those who fear the unfamiliar cold!)  We started with the brussel sprouts and there were a-plenty of those!  They were definitely charred, which I loved about them, and she not as much.  \\n\\nWe then got a special dish, which involved mackeral and a duck fat-soaked potato.  This was VERY tiny-- definitely a one person portion.  Naynay almost ate the entire fish portion in one bite without meaning to!  At a place where sharing is not only encouraged but KEY... you don't want to make for an awkward sharing situation!  :)  \\n\\n(Or even if the same portion was used, there are certainly ways of making it *look* like more or at least splitting it into petit four-esque bites so everyone gets to experience all flavors).\\n\\nWe then ordered a dish I no longer see on the menu... it involved squid and pork belly (an unlikely combination which made for a very pleasant sensory experience!)  I believe it came with fennel puree, which was subtle at best.  Simultaneously, we were knoshing on sweetbreads, which Naynay found to be too salty, but I thought to be just right.  I liked the addition of bacon, but again the other flavors overpowered the puree (which was garlic/almond).\\n\\nAfter those last two dishes, we were spent!  Between pork belly, sweetbreads, and copious amounts of beer, there was no way the bone marrow risotto was happening...so I will be back for that!\\n\\nAs for the beer list, I was definitely pleased!  Take note: draft beer seemed like a deal but did not arrive in a full pint glass (seemed like more than a half pint though..)

Although I'm sure it didn't help that we were a group of ten. \\n\\nEven with the 2 hour wait (ya...), this place really is deserving of 5 stars.

I'm a huge fan of brunch and anyone who can do an original take on that concept is fabulous in my book. I had no idea the food would have an Indian/Moroccan/Spanish? flare to it, but wow the flavors were incredible. All of the ingredients tasted so fresh. I love when food seems so easy to make, yet there's no way I could reproduce this all on my own.\\n\\nWe of course ordered a few waffles and the waitress recommended the raspberry caramel and dark chocolate, both of which were very good. My favorite was the raspberry though. A friend and I split the Fricasse which was incredibly tender and flavorful. The arugula may have been my favorite part. We also split the Saumon Fume.. I have to say this was one of my favorite brunch dishes that I've ever had. I love how they served two halves of the sandwich open-faced, one half with the avocado, salmon, caper spread, and artichoke salad, and the other with the tomato arugula pepperdew salad. The fried egg was on the salmon side.

Every cocktail was something new, crisp, layered, delicious.  Botanist Gin is my favorite and they paired it with fruit flavors and jalapeno, expertly balanced.  The Aviator with floral undertones, and the Rum Apple offering was like a perfect adult Apple Cider.  \\n\\nThey started us off with some canapes, some type of fried crispy shell with molten goat cheese inside.  Awesome.  Next was the beet with marrow butter.  Not popular at the table, but an interesting and flavorful experience none the less.  The tempura mushroom with egg custard was divine.  We had pork skin \\"pasta\\" with shrimp dumplings and those dumplings I could have eaten by the dozen.  I also loved the pork noodle, very gelatinous.  Gluten free.  ;)  \\n\\nThe charred squash was a good portion, a nice break from the very rich courses just prior.  The red shrimp was cooked so perfectly and with such finesse it tasted like incredibly tender lobster.  We had some type of vinegar and tarragon \\"bubble tea\\" shooter as a palette cleanser.  Again, not particularly popular with the less adventurous but I enjoyed it.  Pork shoulder's presentation was perfect and quaint and the coconut bread was a massive hit.  \\n\\nRib eye steak I could have used a bit more char on the outside but it was absolutely cooked perfectly, with incredibly crispy hash on the side.  I could also have eaten a whole plate of this myself.  Actually, can I just order a whole plate of this one night, pretty please?  \\n\\nDuck I'm not a fan of most places and it was good here but I let my duck loving wife have the majority of my offering.  \\n\\nNext up is something really special.  The lemongrass sorbet could have possibly been better if it were just lemon, but the real star was the texture.  Rice pudding with crispy rice and other toppings that offered an incredibly fun and adventurous tasting.  I rarely feel like a dish is \\"fun\\" but this one you couldn't help but play with it in your mouth as you explored the different textures.  AAA+++\\n\\nThe chocolate cake at the end was fine and maybe the only thing I'd say is \\"average\\".  Since it was my birthday they served me a slice of carrot cake with goat cheese icing.

Do keep that in mind when reading.  \\n\\nI love Odd Duck.  I mean I LOVE Odd Duck.  Odd Duck is where I take out of town visitors.  Odd Duck is where I take my dog and a bottle of craft beer for a date.  When I heard that Barley Swine was opening, I was first to the door.  I usually wait several months (or much longer) after a restaurant opening to give it a try.  But since it was Bryce Gilmore's doing, I made an exception. \\n\\nThe aromas coming from the front door just before opening was amazing.  I loved the decor and style of the restaurant.  But after that.....it was less than impressive.  \\n\\nIt was obvious that the beer menu was thoughtful and well-crafted.  However, the beer glasses that we were served looked to be 8 oz pilsner (could have been 6 or 10 oz) glasses.  The prices of beer on draft started at 4.5, which means that a full pint of beer is starts at $7.  While local beers were available and appreciated, $7 a pint is a substantial markup.  The beers (draft anyways) were priced higher than what I've paid at fancy pants restaurants.  I didn't look closely at the price of the beer bombers, though I saw that they were in the neighborhood of $18-24.  That might be more reasonably priced.  \\n\\nOur table of six ordered several different plates, and I only speak for myself in this review.  The potato fritters, goat cheese, and leek espelette ($8) was a great appetizer.  The dish was well executed with simple flavors, a maybe a hair on the under seasoned side.  The leek esplette was fantastic. \\n\\nThe spiced grilled carrot, goat feta, smoked almond vinaigrette ($7) was pretty disappointing.  It was a salad with a very scant scattering of mushy carrot pieces.  The carrot flavor was overwhelmed by the other components of the dish, and I'm wondering if this would be better off being labeled \\"salad with carrot pieces.\\"  I did like the smoked almond vinaigrette in this dish. \\n\\nI tried the white bean soup ($9) that others at my table ordered.  It was served with Spanish chorizo, flaked cod, and olives.  The flavors were complimentary and enjoyable.  \\n\\nMy favorite dish was the barley, foie gras, duck sausage, mushroom, and sweet and sour onion ($18).  The barley (green with kale) was absolutely fantastic.  Have it with a bite of foie gras, and experience bliss.  The only minor issues with this dish was that the duck sausage was kind of dry and tough, and the foie gras wasn't well cleaned.  There were some stringy membranes on it. \\n\\nI also had the grilled strip loin of beef, snails, capers, and onion puree ($14).  The beef was perfectly executed.  Perfect sear, perfect medium rare, and wonderful beef flavor.  However, the rest of the flavors didn't really quite mesh well.  They got lost on the dish.  Also, the beef was about a 2 oz serving. \\n\\nI tried the hoja Santa aged goat cheese, fennel, saffron, and orange ($5), and the Real Ale coffee porter float with pecan ice cream ($5).  The coffee porter float was about a 4 oz serving, and the ice cream was fantastically creamy.  This is ice cream ranks in the top 10% of all ice cream I have had.  The goat cheese dessert was a miss though.  I could see where it was going and how it was supposed to be executed, but it seemed mostly confused.  I'm not sure if the fennel and orange weren't served in small enough pieces to get a bite of everything together or if it just wasn't balanced. \\n\\nOthers at my table also ordered the scallop and sweetbreads, which I didn't try.  I had hoped that the menu would denote which ingredients were locally-sourced (for which I am happy to support).  Some ingredients definitely weren't locally sourced, like foie gras and snails.  \\n\\nOverall, Barely Swine needs some time to mature.  The atmosphere was enjoyable with an upscale casual feel.  However, the food prices priced like high end fine dining, but lacked the flair and creativity.  I wouldn't pay $9 for that soup, but I might pay $6.  I wouldn't pay $8 for the potato fritters, but I might pay $6.  I think $10 for the 2 oz serving for the grilled strip loin would have been more reasonable.  \\n\\nFor a dinner for two (in which we did not feel full) and two 8 oz beers after tax and tip, I paid $80.  I think $50 would be a fair price for the meal we had.  At the current price point, the atmosphere and service needs to be kicked up to fine dining standards and the food needs to really bring it.  If all the dishes we had were as kick butt as the barley and foie gras, I would have been more than satisfied.  I have no problem paying fine dining prices for food that is impressive.  \\n\\nI am confident that Barely Swine can bring their A game, and maybe I'll see that in several months."},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes. Just yes. This little vegan bakery is soooooo good!! I bought a \\"hoho\\" cupcake and a mint filled whoopie pie, it was wonderful! The cake was soooo moist!!

It's just tender and really tasty! I love how you could customize the broth and noodles! They have a few sides to choose from, Gyoza was okay but the soup was delicious! I love that it's not at all salty! You could really taste the richness and creaminess of the  soup! The noodles are just the right amount for sharing! My husband and I shared the classic ramen and we were both full after! It's so good  the reason why we tried this place is because there's always a long line morning and night so I got a #FOMO moment! Lol so I told my hubby let's check it out for dinner, we just shared the whole bowl and we are good to go! Was so satisfying and everything just went well together and complimented each other! I love how it just tasted so satisfying, no wonder there's a line, there's a reason!!! If you're curious just like me and my hubby, try it out and you might end up liking it! Only downside is the line could be long and their restaurant is really small, the tables are too next to each other that I almost bumped the lady who was eating beside us, they should space it out more for people to just feel comfortable and not jammed up."},{"name":"The Painted Pin","address":"737 Miami Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Let's see; I feel like having fun today, I want to eat though and I wouldn't mind getting a little two-step in: DON'T FORGET THAT DRANK!\\n\\nPainted Pins can fulfill an all around \\"good time\\" experience. My husband and I came here for our 10 year anniversary recently. I've been scoping this place out and it was a perfect time to give it a go. I didn't want to spend my whole salary on a steakhouse, and this was the perfect option. Coming down the street, this place can easily be missed but we located the sign then proceeded to the valet. It will cost $2 at the end of your night which was a sweet deal. Upon entry, you can request a bowling lane. Most likely you will be put on a waiting list but the activities you can get into during the wait makes it fly by. They had a live band that was bomb. We ordered the Korean BBQ Pizza and Ribs. My husband enjoyed the ribs. They were tender and falling off the bone. The pizza was pretty cute too. They have some signature specialty drinks available. If you aren't an expert in liquor ingredients, don't be adventurous. I learned that the hard way when I ordered some stuff that was probably drank in a pub by Sherlock Holmes. Stick with what you know.\\n\\nThere are games located along the perimeter of the building, so we indulged in those and did a little Cupid Shuffle until our lane was ready. Overall, it was an amazing time. You can get into many things without having to go to a gang of places. The crowd was great, inviting and mature. I will be back many times over.\\n\\nStrike!!"},{"name":"Big City","address":"138 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here a few times for various occasions, and the most recent was New Year's Eve. Prior to New Year's Eve I would have given this place 4 stars, but a few things happened that night that knocked my impression of this place down a peg or two.\\n\\nUnlike most places in my experience, Big City was more than tolerable on New Year's Eve because I think everyone in Boston was closer to the downtown area or at home. We arrived around 9:30ish after having dinner in the Back Bay area and had no trouble getting a pool table and a place to sit. Fast forward a couple hours later and Margot G. had gone to the bar to get a regular coke for her friend who'd been drinking wine that the bar had run out of (fun side note: rather than admit to running out, they tried to serve her a completely different kind of wine and hoped she wouldn't notice...well, she did). As Margot came toward the table, all of the sudden the glass she was holding EXPLODED in her hand leaving a *very* deep gash in her pinky finger and several other cuts. Me and one other person witnessed the whole thing, and it just seemed to explode for no reason. Bleeding profusely, she and her friend headed into the bathroom to get the glass out of the cut while I asked several times for some band-aids and first aid stuff. The first thing I was handed were some napkins. Thanks for that, but she's bleeding because *your* pint glass exploded in her hand (my guess is you took a glass just washed in hot water and then filled it immediately with ice and coke...hmmm, I wonder what's going to happen?). I finally managed to get some band-aids at the least, and we did our best to patch her up. \\n\\nThat was the extent to which they helped and/or tried to make up for this situation. They didn't try to comp us anything or give us another one of the drinks that exploded...we ended up with a full bill and an injured person. Margot, having been a bartender and server before law school, explained that most places will do something to try and make up for what happened in these cases (either comp stuff on the bill or offer a free round, etc), and that she was incredibly surprised that they didn't make any attempts to this effect. We certainly weren't going to ask for it either.\\n\\nOther than those couple of fun things (trying to fake a wine selection and not seeming to care that their glassware left a giant gash in someone's hand), Big City's still okay. Their beer selection is extensive and fairly cheap, but the selection downstairs at Sunset is much better. Food is typical pub fare and tasty with your beer, but again, Sunset downstairs has a better selection. I'm sure we'll be back with the number of pool tables that are here, but I'll never look at a pint glass in the same way again whenever I'm here."},{"name":"PDX Sliders","address":"3111 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome sliders and friendly service.

If you live near here, you probably already come.\\nThe best thing about the place is the location - it sits next to a body of water and a fun kids fountain.\\nIn the summer they open up the wall out to the fountain to give that great indoors/outdoors place. Of course, in the winter, you don't want to sit next to these walls but they give light when there is so very little of it in Oregon. Beyond the garage walls, overall, the place has a very weird aesthetic or lacks one. I honestly can't tell.\\n\\nThey don't mind people sitting around reading, studying, playing games, surfing the internet, whatever with only a minimal purchase of a house coffee. \\n\\nThey have incredible hours - they open early and stay open late (midnight)\\n\\nThe WiFi isn't great but it is free. There are parts of the place where you have good reception, others where it is crap. I don't think it is every great. \\n\\nThey have a very limited set of power outlets. Once people get to them they often stay more than an hour so don't hold your breath in hopes of getting one.\\n\\nCoffee. I know you think I'm joking but they have some of the worst coffee I've tasted. I'm not only talking about the house coffees (I challenge you to taste any difference between their roasts) but also the espresso coffees. I'm pretty sure the baristas haven't even watched a YouTube on how to make an espresso, Americano, or latte. I guess there is a reason baristas apprentice for years. But go ahead, ask your barista to make yours with latte art. A good chuckle will brighten your day.\\n\\nTea. By contrast, the teas are all pretty good - but be warned I'm normally a coffee drinker so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. I like the green ones and the white one. They are not only pretty but taste nice.\\n\\nPastries. I am pretty sure they make their own pastries but there is a reason there are professional pastry chefs. My advice would be grab a pastry from New Seasons and bring it with you.  They don't seem to mind people bringing in food from other places. Everything is super sweet and not very light and fluffy. The coconut macaroons are perfect to split with someone. \\n\\nIf the key thing you are looking for is a comfortable place to sit around, this is it.\\nIf you are looking for a nice coffee, keep looking."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ate the Sol Taco and one of the brunch specials, the Pain Perdu(French toast made with french bread).
