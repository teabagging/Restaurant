The food was comparable enough to the authentic cuisine you get in Chinatown, minus the headaches from searching for a parking spot. Lately, the food has been off. I came here for dinner a month ago and all the dishes came out as expected, fresh and on point. Then I came here two weeks ago for dinner and all the dishes were over-salted and looked as if they've been 1) sitting out for too long or 2) recooked (you know that drab color difference between fresh and recooked eggplant). Not the type to send dishes back, we ate the food but one dish in particular was an issue - the shrimp covered in mayonnaise. The shrimp was OBVIOUSLY ROTTEN. This dish is my favorite, so my mom makes an effort to get it at each restaurant. We told the server and without a second thought, she denied that it tasted funny (didn't bother going to ask the kitchen if the seasoning might have been off, etc). Then I watched her walk over to the woman owner and the woman (while sitting on her @ss eating) denies adamantly that there's anything wrong (once again, not ever stepping foot into the kitchen). Then the server comes back and has the audacity to say, I've spoken with the owner and nothing is wrong with this dish. No offer to replace or give us another option on the menu. WE WILL NOT BE BACK because of their poor customer service, even if it was a fluke and the chef was just off for the night. \\n\\nWord to the owners: Quincy is already the new Chinatown and with your poor attitude, rest assure that we have plenty of other dining options in the area. Word travels."},{"name":"Golden Corral Buffet & Grill","address":"2701 W Vine St","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"If I can give you guys less .1/3 star I will.

I didn't see the manager.. that how poor is that place.. we pay to much for so poor unclean place.. can't believe it!!!!!"},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"To be fair, I am giving Contigo three stars because every person who was working there during my experience was lovely.  Y'all are great.  I also recognize that this restaurant has an ever-changing menu since they use all local ingredients.  That is awesome.  Finally, I may just be a little bored with this whole concept, so three stars might be a little harsh for such a nice place.  \\n\\nNow for the review!  We were greeted by a very nice host who informed us that the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour long.  He explained that we were welcome to hang out and order drinks, popcorn and olives until we were seated.  The drinks were good, I wasn't a huge fan of the olives, and I was really sad that the popcorn was covered in brown sugar.  There were other appetizer things on the menu next to olives and popcorn that I would have preferred, like the pickles.  I wish Contigo would consider opening up that appetizer menu a little more since it is a popular spot where folks generally have to wait.\\n\\nWhen we were seated my best friend and I ordered more cocktails which were still really good, Cauliflower Gratin, Crispy Green Beans, and the Chicken Thigh all from the Small Plates section.  My husband ordered the Porchetta Sandwich.  He liked his food just fine, but said it wasn't anything super special compared to other specialty sandwiches at other cool restaurants in town.  Best friend and I devoured all of our food because we were starving, but the cauliflower was really nothing to write home about, and the chicken thigh was soooo small!  I know, I know.  It's a Small Plate menu item, and it was nicely executed in terms of tastiness, but that does not change the fact that it was a $10 piece of chicken thigh no bigger than 3 oz!!!  Even purchased locally, chicken thighs are just about the cheapest cut of meat on the market.  This portion should be doubled with a quickness, and this is coming from a reasonably light eater.  I rarely finish a plate of food.  Fortunately the green beans were really great.  To me they taste almost exactly like the beer-battered green beans at Hyde Park Grill.  You can't go wrong when you batter and fry just about anything.  The dipping sauce that comes with them is spicy and delicious.  I almost ordered a second ramekin.\\n\\nI can't give it a full recommendation, but Contigo has a ton of great reviews, so mine is just one more to consider.  I just feel like there are a lot of places with these similar, not extremely fantastic menu options these days and I'm bored.  Local doesn't have to mean boring, small, etc...  If Contigo were the only one of it's kind, I would probably feel differently, but------------  I don't."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I will admit, I think that Home Slice's pizza just up the street is a bit tastier.

I lined up and wasn't 100% sure what I wanted right away, but I had at least two of the barista's ask me for my order. Nice to see they are there to help immediately. The frissant's were very delicious. I tried their seasonal pumpkin and the standard (I'm guessing?) Vanilla flavour. It was nice to see they try seasonal (pumpkin) flavours, and I was delightfully surprised that it has a filling. The frissant was nice and flakey, falling apart when eating. The pumpkin frissant didn't have as much filling as the Vanilla frissant had, but they both satisfied. The location isn't large, so I would probably avoid sitting down during busy hours. If your into donuts and want to try something different, you should definitely stop by this place and try out their frissant's.

Well, the last time we were there, we were closer to the back of the room and were not attended to but the other times I was there, the service was alright.  Not quite up to the usual Japanese standards of attentiveness- but polite and prompt.\\n\\nThe selection is a little different- they offer some authentically Japanese dishes that I haven't had anywhere else in the city (yet).  They have Japanese breakfast sets.  I had something a little too authentic for my taste though- grated yam.  It was as unpalatable as natto.  Ok, granted I haven't had natto in 20 plus years, but that initial 'tastes like saliva' reaction has stayed with me over the years.  Anyway, the yam dish was just as slimy.  But maybe some of you are looking for that 'slimy' taste..in authentic natto and grated yam.\\n\\nWhat I've liked- chicken karaage, tempura, their huge selection of fish.\\n\\nOn top of the a la carte dishes, it will cost you I think $3 more for rice and miso to make it a teishoku (set) and  about $5 more to make it a set with some side dishes (vegetables and pickled vegetables)- I love those.  So, it is just slightly more expensive than the run of the mill Japanese places around.\\n\\nBut, it is authentic and has a big selection of fish (grilled or fried) not available at other places.\\n\\nI haven't had the sushi here.\\n\\nOh, and if you like croquettes, the curry croquette is yummy."},{"name":"Rishi Sushi Kitchen & Bar","address":"114 N 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Terrible service, mediocre sushi that was over priced for quality, server forgot about our appetizer.

The presentation was bad the shrimps on top of a rice that look like leftovers.  The taste of stake and shrimps was good but presentation means a lot when you talk about food.  The side of mac & cheese was not close to be good. . They were cold and the texture of the pasta was like they boiled for 20mins.

The chicken curry is infused with Mauritian spices and flavors, using ingredients like thyme, curry leaves, and red wine. The chicken was extremely moist, shredded dark meat that soaked up the flavors of Mauritius. Obviously, I got the spiciest curry on the menu (\\"Island Fever\\").\\n\\nShyam presented me with a heaping pile of food. You should have seen the panda's eyes light up as he received this feast. It was a glorious mound of noodles, shredded chicken, and spices. The dish had a nice habanero kick to take this dish to the next level. This is a food cart where you will get your money's worth.\\n\\nHighly recommended food cart!"},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't expect great service from the bar staff, but do expect efficient order takers and DELICIOUS food!

So I stumbled across this place and ended up asking the manager where my hotel was. He was a nice guy, but he probably gave me the most confusing directions ever. I ordered the spicy kalbi soup to-go and it wasn't bad. Tasted just like yuk-gae-jang except with bits of kalbi in it. To be honest, the soup was more expensive than I would have liked, but the waitress was really sweet so I couldn't complain.

Also, chew carefully & watch out for rabbit bones!\\n\\nI also got to try some of the crispy green beans, cauliflower gratin, & face bacon. The face bacon (basically thin strips of bacon) went really well with the fermented carrot that comes on top. The cauliflower gratin was delicious, although there wasn't very much of it.

Once I saw Glady Knight on food network show not sure which one believe man vs food. Too see an owner not only passionate about her food but willing too get down messy in the kitchen. The next time visit Atlanta need too come check it out. \\n\\nI went for lunch with my friend visiting near the Atlanta area. It literally located right in the heart of downtown Atlanta. We found parking on the street walking distance from the restaurant. They have small parking lots that can park and with the street parking non of it free. Still its major city downtown it is what it is or could catch martha get off close by.\\n\\nOne of the first things I noticed when I  walk in was sense of celebrity or some name owner restaurant  The walls once you get seated lined with some pretty cool celebs stopped by for the food. The decor is very elegant feels like walking into formal dining room but yet the dress attire more on the casual side. The workers soon step foot in the restaurant greeted us with warm smile and welcome. \\n\\nOnce we got seated already knew what I wanted but still looks over the menu. It has nice diversity too it. But said sold on chicken & waffles soon sat down. I not disappointed. The chicken wings (refreshing and know souther when have the full wing wing even the tips noting too waste) were amazing!! The breading was nice, light, crispy, and held all the juices still moist perfect cooked chicken on the inside. It nice Hot too. The breading that I loved is flour based coated not heavy but yet had ton of flavor. I had some with little hot sauce and some without but either case no wrong way. The waffles we nice fluffy, moist, and golden. The real star was the chicken. I washed it all down with house blended sweet tea/ice tea. The perfect compliment wash down all the goodness of some real Chicken & Waffles.

I ordered 4 tacos: el pastor, chorizo, barbacoa, and steak.  Once you get your tacos, you can then dress them up with various toppings on your own.  Of those four tacos, I like the first two the best; the pastor taco is really rich in flavor, and the chorizo has that nice balance between spiciness and smokiness.  All tacos are served in corn tortillas (yaaas).  Also, the tacos are pretty small; I could eat each one in 2-2.5 bites.\\n\\nIt really does get busy during lunch hours; so it's best to eat and be out because you want to be considerate of patrons coming in and looking for seats.  The seating is more accommodating for groups (rather than eating on your own).

I'm talking unprofessional and immature staff. The newest cook is a younger  guy who just minutes ago screwed up my order. But this isn't the worst part. After the hostess kindly asks me if I want it remade she brings my order back. It takes 2 minutes to remake something that originally took 10 minutes to make. This is because it wasn't remade. As I sit down, waiting for my new and fresh food to come out I watch their television. I glance down to see that I can clearly see the reflection of the cook and the hostess in the kitchen. I can also hear them snickering and trying to speak softly. I however hear them due to the acoustics. \\n\\nCook: \\"He seriously wants me to remake this?\\"\\n\\nHostess: \\"Yes.\\"\\n\\nCook: \\"Did you ask him?\\"\\n\\nHostess: \\"Yeah.\\"\\n\\nCook: \\"F**k that I'm not remaking this.\\"\\n\\nHe then begins to take the contents in the fryer out of it and empty it into the container.\\n\\nHostess: \\"Oh my god, is that the left over chicken pieces that have been in the fryer all day?\\"\\n\\nCook: \\"Yes\\"\\n\\nHostess: \\"Oh my god, you're the man\\"\\n\\nShe bags my order and calls me over.

Here's the story:\\nCalled ahead around 4 asking if you could make reservations during Happy Hour, as I was planning on being late (and it seemed popular).  I was informed that they do not make reservations.  No problem -- I'll still give it a shot.\\nArrived at the Salty Sow, a little after 6.  Happy Hour seating was full (no surprise), but the girlfriend and I weren't too hungry and were willing to wait for openings.  We were told unequivocally that there would be no seating options, and seated in the main dining room on a community table.\\nSeating was definitely cramped, but our waitress was all smiles and the cocktail was delicious (Sangria is a must-try)!  We asked if we could still access the Happy Hour menu, but was informed that the food on that menu was EXCLUSIVE to Happy Hour, and you could not order it in the main restaurant.  Was looking forward to a lot of menu items on that, so a bit of a disappointment.  Won't lose any sleep over it, though.\\nAppetizers were amazing.  We had the Jalapeno Cheese Curds, and they were absolutely incredible.  Braised pork shoulder was as-advertised -- I didn't end up enjoying it, but I ordered it to expand my pork \\"horizons.\\"  Again, great presentation on the meal.\\n\\nThe experience towards the end of our meal, however, was atrocious.  Community seating meant we were directly next to another young couple, clearly pregnant.  Much to our surprise, halfway through our meal plates started coming out that were exactly what the girlfriend and I were wanting from the Happy Hour menu.  But wait a minute -- we were just told the menu was only available on the patio?  Seeking not to embarrass our fellow diners, we tried to casually mention this to our waitress.  Clearly flustered, she explained that the manager had allowed them to order off the menu.  Still confused as to why an exception was not made in our case (we had sat down earlier than the other couple) we asked to speak to the manager.  \\nThe manager on duty, Daniel, came over after our meal was finished.  Trying to be polite, we explained the situation and our puzzlement.  Daniel was immediately defensive, citing that it was a \\"one-time exception\\" because the couple was pregnant.  Don't get me wrong, I'll open doors and pull out chairs to help a pregnant lady, but using it as an excuse (in a very brusque, rude manner) instead of apologizing immediately and trying to right the situation was unacceptable.  When we continued to push, he said we could have made reservations and it was our fault for not arriving on time.  I replied that I had both called ahead and offered to wait in the restaurant, and his staff had delivered contrary messages on both fronts.  This seemed to take the wind out of his sails, and he finally capitulated and offered to comp our entree.  Feeling like we had just gone three rounds against Ali, we left the restaurant feeling dissatisfied and irritated.\\n\\nTL;DR: Drinks and food were delicious and exactly as advertised.  Inconsistency with communication on Happy Hour is hardly excusable, though, and the manager, Daniel, is as unprofessional as they come.

Bummer.\\n\\nThe website says they open at 11am for brunch, so we all agreed to meet up then thinking we'd get in early on ACL weekend. My boyfriend and I arrived at 11:05, assuming we'd find our friends inside at a table. Nope, they were lingering outside the patio whose entrance was blocked off by chairs.\\n\\nTen minutes later, I was frustrated enough to move the chairs and saunter inside (the double doors were cracked open a bit the entire time) thinking that perhaps someone had just forgotten to remove the barricade. \\n\\nIt took me a moment to find a someone and when I spotted one, I called out, \\"are you guys open?\\" No clear answer. I spotted someone else and neither of them looked happy to see us. Very unsettling. Granted, I did bust through the chair barricade, but you were supposed to be open 15 minutes ago?! We approached a table in the back and the gal indicated it was ok to sit down. I believe she exchanged a word or two with my companions about the buffet. My friend asked if it was buffet only, or if we could order off a menu as well. She said she would go check but then never returned with an answer? \\n\\nA few minutes later she came to take a out drink order, but we honestly weren't sure if we were staying. Neither her or the other guy wandering around were rude, but were not exactly friendly, and it wasn't clear what was going on with the buffet. We ordered waters, thinking things may become more clear or comfortable.\\n\\nThe entire vibe was off. One other gal was there by herself at a table with balloons, I'm not sure if she was approached at all.  A few minutes after we arrived a few guys came in, sat down, were approached by our server, and then they got up and left. Weird.  \\n\\nWe decided to leave. I was so uncomfortable the entire time I was in there. Zero customer service. It was supposed to be a celebration and started off on a terrible foot. I can give folks the benefit of the doubt. Maybe something went wrong in the kitchen, or someone didn't show up for their shift, whatever, shit happens. But at least peek your head out when you are supposed to open and invite the people waiting outside your restaurant inside. Explain, take a drink order, no biggie. Be happy there are people lining up outside to get in.\\n\\nIf there was some legit reason they did not open on time, I can understand that customers barging in could throw things off a bit. but they are still CUSTOMERS, it would be nice to feel welcome. Party of 6 would have been a nice chunk of change, particularly with no other customers in there.  I dunno, I don't mean to come off like I need my ass kissed when I walk into your restaurant, but we were all uncomfortable enough we did not want to stay. \\n\\nIn an effort to do the right thing I had a very brief interaction with the guy behind the bar on the way out. I thought it was rude to get up and walk out, so I mentioned to him, Thanks, but we weren't really feeling comfortable: the restaurant did not seem prepared for customers, the staff was not very welcoming, and that we expected a different experience. It was awkward. Of course. But I felt like I should at least say something. His response was a mumbled, \\"uh, ok\\" (in the tone of \\"whatever!\\") and he turned back to what he was doing.\\n\\nAbsolutely not ok. \\n\\nGiven the reviews I really wanted to check this place out, but I am so upset at this experience.

Don't know why there's all this hate for HML's dimsum.  I'm slowly making my way through the other dimsum restaurants, but HML is my top so far over highly acclaimed Kirin and Sun Sui Wah.  I've been 3 times and always have great food.  To each his own, I suppose.  The prices here are also more reasonable.  They are currently running a promotion of 20% off dimsum and free tea, including weekends and holidays (it used to be just weekdays).  The menu also changes from time to time, which I think is good because they keep up with current tastes.  Bad if they get rid of something you like though!\\n\\nI suppose that I should note that I'm from Hong Kong, so I don't expect attentive service because that's just not how it is.  Yes, HML is hectic and you have to flag down someone if you want something, but if you want an authentic experience, that's it.  The way you can tell if service is good is how fast your tea pot gets filled once you flip the cover.  HML staff was prompt and even more than prompt sometimes - filling even before the cover was flipped.  \\n\\nI like that they give you a print out of the stuff you ordered so you know what actually went into their system (sometimes the wrong thing is selected and that way you can tell) and you can tell what you still have left coming.  As your food comes, the waiter crosses the item off the list.  I will say that when they're super busy, the waiters sometimes try to serve someone else's food, but by having the list, they can tell you didn't order it.\\n\\nThings we had this last time:\\n- Shark fin dumpling: I'm personally not a fan of it generally but bf enjoyed it more than the one we got at Kirin. Lots of seafood inside.\\n- Baked egg and milk tart:  right amount of flakiness and baked just enough that the custard didn't dribble all over the place when you bit into it, but not overcooked. We noticed that every table around us had at least an order of this\\n- Salted yolk bun: creamy goodness.  it has a slightly grainy texture because it's made from salted duck egg yolks and they're grainy. They put a lot in the bun so you don't get a lot of dough. Yay.\\n- Shrimp dumpling: big and plump. they use a mixture of whole and chopped shrimp inside. i hate when places use frozen shrimp because it leaves a weird taste.  this was definitely fresh.\\n- Taro pumpkin cake: interesting mixture of the two flavors. a bit oily because it was panfried but the flavors work well together\\n- XO sauce with beef tripe: it's the honey comb tripe. they could have used a bit more XO sauce\\n-Mango tapioca pudding:  great dessert. wish i wasn't so full that i could have finished it!\\n\\nI will say that 99% of the customers there were Cantonese (everyone was speaking Cantonese around us) and the restaurant was filled with a bunch of people waiting around noon on Saturday.  When we've gone on a weekday, there are decent amount of older folks there.

It's behind the Waffle house in a not so great location in what used to be a strip club. The people here seem to think that this somehow makes the food bad which is just stupid. Shame on those who shun good business cuz this lady can cook! \\nUsually she'll have your food ready in 10 mins, max 15mins (for 2 people). This woman is really friendly and super nice. I have a really hard time trying to figure out why more people aren't going here. I'm hung up on it really and I cant get myself to stop bit*%ing about it. \\n\\nWe ordered the General Tso chicken and house special lo mein and 2 spring rolls; around $20 which is normal. The chicken, still not like home makes it, was very good! I like when places aren't scared to make the food spicy. Spicy food should be spicy..right? It's just spicy enough for me, but Tom thought it needed more peppers. Whatever..\\n\\nThe spring rolls were the best Ive ever had! I'm so used to them being squishy and soggy and just..bad since theyre too greasy. I hate greasy food in general so I normally don't order them. It was the best thing I had from here, and deff the best Spring roll I've had anywhere! \\n\\nThe lo mein was ok.. I had tofu added to it since it's been a while since I've had some and when I'm in the mood I tend to enjoy it. That said..it's usually not made properly. Since tofu sucks up the flavor you're cooking with it in I just like it for added texture. But like I said..normally I wouldn't dare get it since no one seems to make it right. I prefer mine grilled with teriyaki sauce or hoisin. The lady make really good tofu...some pieces still tasted a little too 'tofu-y' but it was nice to find a place where I can order more of it. The outside was just crispy enough that the eggy inside blended nicely. (eggy is the only way I can describe the inside to those who havnt had good tofu. Think scrambled eggs) The lo mein itself was good to but a little less flavorful then I'd like. Lots of cabbage too, which is nice. The shrimp was the highlight here...best shrimp I've had in a while from anywhere. No kidding! I was very pleasantly surprised by this and it more then made up for the lack of sauce in the dish. Also there was some chicken and beef, chives, carrots (julienne, not chunks or circles)...my mind is going blank to the rest of what was in it. Nothing weird though..just traditional lo mein made right. Only issue was the lack of yummy sauce but a little soy sauce fixed that issue. \\n\\nI've found my new chinese place in town. Columbus in general seems to have many different style 'american chinese' places to pick from. If you want your chinese food to taste like ti should then go here. Otherswise you may never know how good it could be. Sure you may think there are better places elsewhere but in the end that depends on your taste. Like Columbus pizza (Donatos & grandads)...there are columbus type chinese places. This, thankfully, is not one of them. So for those of you who want \\"real\\" chinese food (..made the American way) then this is your place. If you're looking for real chinese food (made the real way...not the american way) that have that too. Nothing too funky, so if you're looking for thinks like frogs legs or sea cucumber or jelly fish salad check out Little Dragon on Morse Rd."},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Nice place, good food great service.\\nThe fried avocado is lack luster and the cute little waitress knew it, but didn't give her input until after we bought it."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Atmosphere and cocktails were awesome!

I know that sounds like a stretch, but I am dead serious! My sister had the smothered chicken with squash casserole and greens and she wasn't too impressed either. The squash casserole is more like boiled squash than a casserole. There was no cheese. Our waffles were good and my niece's macaroni and cheese was ok. I am a southern girl who knows what good southern food tastes like and this just wasn't it. I'm definitely a Glady fan; but I sure hope that the food she eats at home is better than this.\\n\\nBy the way, we were there on a week night so the wait wasn't too bad."},{"name":"P.F.

My mom had the veal scallopini & the meat & sauce were also very tasty. \\n\\nDessert was a different story. Pear Flambe & Opera Cake..... disappointing. Barely no flames on the flambe.. sauce was way too citrus-y and the pear was not sweet. The opera cake was minuscule!!!!! Maybe 1/4\\" tall & not very good. And for $8.50. WHAT?!

The food is usually exceptional and the atmosphere pleasant with the staff upbeat. The last two visits were different. Both times they did not have gluten free bread, a major reason that my family goes due to having both vegan and a celiac family member. The first reason was that it was not defrosted which seemed a silly excuse not to accommodate us since there are toasters. The second time when a wait server asked the person in charge, he angrily answered, \\"If one more person asks me that.....\\" and he stormed out of the room saying he hasn't had time to get it ready. He then loudly threw a metal pan into the sink startling the customers. The staff was not pleased either. This is not the Veggie Galaxy I know, and I hope that this can be corrected.

When I went here yesterday, even with a reservation it was a 20 minute wait. Not that big of a problem though, it was Saturday night as well as during their rush hour. \\n\\nWe were stuck on ordering which soup base we wanted for the fish. I suggested Spicy with Pepper because it isn't as spicy as their most spiciest one. We ended up ordering the Black Bean base which was meh, I would've preferred the spicy base. Codfish was good, and the noodles were good too. If they were in the spicy soup base it would've been better. \\n\\nWe ordered 10 lamb skewers, and these come out pretty quick which is nice. I like the flavour of their skewers, a little peppery and salty, not too complicated. Their spicy chicken wings are really really good. They give you about 2-3 per skewer and I had about 4 skewers of these. Ox throat was good too, I thought they were going to be very chewy, but they were soft and had the texture of fishballs. They also had plain white bun skewers which i didn't think much of until I had them. They were slightly sweet, crispy outside and oh so soft inside. You didn't need to dip them in anything, they were that good. \\n\\nSide dishes were pretty good as well. The spicy beef tendons were so good, their spicy sauce is slightly sweet as well. I don't know how to say this in english but it is clear noodles with chilli and cucumber, had a really nice flavour. The shredded potatoes were a bit lacking in a vinegar taste, but overall okay. \\n\\nThis place is loud and I mean LOUD. People talk loud because the music playing on the TV is pretty loud.To me I don't really mind as much, but this is more of a hangout place for your friends rather than a date spot. Service to me is fine, you don't really need to interact with them as much other than drink refills and stuff but they clean up your table once in awhile which is good. Parking is very difficult to find at rush hours, we luckily managed to grab a spot once we entered the lot. \\n\\nTo have a good time, expect to spend a good amount of money because everything is pretty expensive when added up together.

The main strip of Hanover Street becomes too crowded and touristy after a while. This restaurant is tucked away on a quiet side street, at least makes you feel like you're transported back in time to what it used to be. Ask for a table by the windows to peer down on the cobblestone streets or there's a private little alcove on the 2nd floor perfect for a quiet dinner!\\n\\nAs for the food, I think it's quite homey as well. We both started with the salad which was fine. I had the halibut for my entree which is very well cooked, and the mashed parsnip with the very savory sauce made it quite a dish of comfort food. My husband also really liked his bolognese pasta. The chocolate torte was a pleasing ending to the meal. \\n\\nAlso I like to point out that I really enjoyed my server there (sorry forgot his name!).

My wings were the best Daytona style wings I have ever gotten at any Hooter's across the country I have dined in.  They actually left some good charcoal on one side of every wing to give it a good smoky taste!  My son's sliders were cooked well, not dry at all and his curly fries were steaming hot.

First and foremost, our server was amazing. I can't remember his name but if your records show, I originally had a party set for 12 on December 9th, but due to the winter storm, we dropped to a party of 7. He was very attentive and made us laugh as if he was a part of the group, not serving us...so kudos to him and his excellent customer service. \\n\\nAs much as he did to make the evening enjoyable, it started off on a bumpy road that I know could have been avoided. It should be conveyed to your patrons that they can't be seated until the entire party has arrived. As some of my party was running late (due to the nasty conditions which it doesn't look that was considered), we were only informed when we arrived that we could only be seated once everyone arrived. It would have been nice to have that information well ahead of time either when I made the reservation or when I called to ask questions or when I was given a courtesy reminder call twice leading up to that night. \\n\\nSecondly, our server did all he could to make the evening enjoyable. But it is almost outrageous to have to wait an entire hour to get food after the order was taken. No one ordered an appetizer or a salad in our party. We had drinks and entrees. As we were trying to celebrate a birthday, we tried to keep the best of spirits but we undoubtedly missed other arrangements planned for the evening because of this.\\n\\nLastly, I was very disappointed in the parking service for your restaurant.

We were seated almost immediately, which was nice. Unfortunately from here, the whole dinner went downhill. First of all we did not get a \\"kind\\" greeting from our waitress as one would expect. The lady never introduced herself, just asked if we were eating all you can eat sushi, or kitchen, and got our drinks. Our drinks came out fast. Their pricing is different (more expensive) than their online menu says. The ordering was easy to do, just check off what we want. Because each \\"check\\" gives us 6 pieces of sushi, we only checked off two types (total of 12) because although I love sushi, my friends have not had it before. The sushi that came out was good, but it seemed as if it was not made \\"fresh\\" as they advertise. I did very well enjoy it though. I would come back if the service was not so poor. * Now for the real negatives. After ordering the sushi, our waitress walked over to put our order in, and talked to a fellow waitress. I looked over slightly, and noticed both of them were staring at our table, giggling to each other, which was very rude. The sushi has no descriptions at all, and if you try asking what is in it, you won't get a really clear response. If you leave *any* sushi behind, they charge you $1 each piece, which is ridiculous if they advertise all you can eat. They claim they do not like wasting food, but really, it is because they want to make more money. Our waitress throughout our dinner continued to suggest to us to order things from the separate menu such as rice, ribs, etc. to get us to fill ourselves, and stop ordering sushi, even after I told her we are here for the sushi only. Also she did not explain if ordering from the other all you can eat menu would cost another $26 per person, so I also did not order in fear that they would charge us another $26 per person. I will admit, the food ordered by the other tables received their sushi very fast, and we had to wait around 15 minutes each time we ordered. I honestly felt very judged by this place, and so did all of my friends. We felt \\"judged\\" so much that the whole sitting was uncomfortable, and we would have rather gone to somewhere like McDonalds to eat. When walking out of the restaurant, our waitress looked at us, and did not even say thank you or good bye, and looked away.

After returning 5 minutes after our set reservation we were finally showed to our table 25 minutes late by our previous stuck up hostess. My main course, which was  a mushroom ravioli, was cold and far too salty to have more than a few bites. My friend had the Fruitti de Mare (which is hard to mess up anywhere) and they managed to pair it with an odd and over-sized angel hair pasta which failed to soak up any sort of flavor from the dish. Meanwhile, throughout the entire course we were offered more than a generous siesta during our appetizer, entre' and desert due to us appearing invisible to the even more invisible staff. The desert was delicious (espresso flan) and the two stars all go to this flan.

I had amazing gnocchi in Italy, and both times I thought they were about the same. I even had gnocchi once in California, and I thought it was pretty good too. Anyway, the gnocchi pieces were really big, so the middle lacked sauce and was a bit harder. It wasn't very fluffy. The sauce was really good though!

Though the food seemed pretty authentic for these parts, I was not  personally \\"wowed\\" by the flavors, and thought our dished could have both used some extra seasoning. I am not sure what the lunch prices are like, but I thought the dinner prices were a bit more expensive than I am willing to pay on a regular basis. \\n\\nI am sure we will go back at some point, but it probably will not become our \\"go to\\" Mexican spot in the near future."},{"name":"Yebo","address":"3500 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went here for a working lunch, and was very, very pleased.

However, this wasn't the case.  \\n\\nThe decor to this place is relatively nice; it has a dim atmosphere along with your prerequisite celebrity photos lined up on the walls.  \\n\\nI ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was just okay.  It's hard to f up fried chicken.  The waffle, unfortunately, was terrible.  It wasn't crispy, wasn't flavorful, and was just mushy.  Ugh.  I tried out a chicken wing from another person's plate, along with some other food, and it was just okay.\\n\\nThe prices are on the higher side as well, when compared to other diners.  It becomes expensive when you factor in what you actually get.  Do you actually get the value you deserve with your hard earned money when you come here?  Nope.

Not great, but good.  The patties are overcooked and they need some seasoning.  They offer a good number of toppings to choose from and the veggies were fresh.  Just a warning that the \\"regular\\" burger is two patties and the \\"junior\\" is one.  I hate when they do this.  Two patties is a double!  'Hamburger/Cheeseburger' implies ONE patty, not two.  Don't mess with established semantics, people!!\\n\\nFries: Fresh, tasty and they give you a lot of them!  Ask for the Cajun fries if you like some extra flavor.  I don't see how some reviewers dislike these fries.  They're fresh and thick cut which, if you've ever made fries for yourself (from fresh potatoes, not frozen from a bag), you'll know that they're not supposed to be super crispy!\\n\\nPrice: A little much for lunch.  My opinion is that fast food lunch should be under $10 and I routinely pay a little over that.  Their drinks are seriously overpriced compared to other places.  I actually don't buy drinks if I'm ordering to-go.\\n\\nOther points: The service isn't exactly fast because they make your burger and fries when you order it so don't expect instantaneous delivery of your meal after ordering.

Still the best crust in town, but the rest was disappointing.  Hopefully those times were a fluke, and not a sign of things going downhill?\\n\\nThe service is all over the map.  Generally slow, but if it was just slowness I could easily write that off as the fair cost of high quality.  Sometimes though it's really... really... really slow.

I go to yelp because I want to know how the FOOD was. So the person complaining about the dead flowers: Those were gifts given to the bakery when they first opened a week EARLIER. I was there that very same Grand Opening day, and some were looking wilted, but how did that affect the *taste* of the bread? Since I was third in line, I saw that people were grabbing *huge* piles of bread. It was easy to see how the store got completely emptied after over 20 people  bought at least 15+ pieces of bread each.  It's a bummer that you got there when they ran out but uh, pretty sure they didn't expect that to happen either (and there is nothing worse than making too much food and throwing it out at the end of the day). That's a bit of an unfair rating, Danny. To the person complaining about prices and didn't see what the big deal was, I can tell you this is very high quality product. If you want something cheap, go buy week old bread shipped in at a local asian market. The fact that Oyatsupan takes the time to make their breads from scratch and ferment them the day before, and bake them the day of *fresh* already makes the cost well worth it. If I wanted cheap carb filler I'd go to costco and buy a pack of bagels or croissants. This is like comparing Jiro Ono to Sushi Stop. Ok, enough of that, on to my own review~\\n------\\nAnticipating a busy Grand Opening, I showed up 25 minutes before the store opened, and ended up third in line. The bakery was surprisingly bustling with a completely full staff anticipating a busy launch (there were at least 3-4 employees manning the front end, with a half dozen including the owner running the back). Since I knew I'd be back, I picked out a matcha melon pan and melon pan for my fiance, and an pan (red bean filled) for myself. The shelves are very clever, there is an acrylic door that you can pull up, and then push back like a garage door. I didn't realize this and was trying to hold it open while holding my tray and gingerly using tongs to pick out bread- now I know. ;) Since I arrived so early I didn't see any baguette type breads out yet. Understandably, even bakeries opened for years will not have all their stock out at opening time. The bread was so fresh they were quite delicate. I used the tongs to gently take them out by holding the sides (don't squeeze from the top and bottom!).  I saw shokupan on their menu (a tender, white dinner bread), and they would have the square style (the ones with the rounded tops are called yama shokupan) out in a few minutes. The store at this point had over 20 people and the line was getting huge, so understandably it took some time for them to get to slicing the shokupan for me (they were setting out unsliced shokupan, for which you can request thin or thick slices. I love thick!). I walked in the door at about 8 am, and left at about 8:20 am and with a very lovely free mug that they gave as a promotion (first 30 customers). \\n\\nEven though the bread was gently placed in individual bags and into my larger bag, they did get *slightly* smooshed. This didn't bother me in the slightest, but might be something to keep in mind. The bread is that lovely and soft!\\n\\nBoth melon pans had an amazing delicate and just crisp surface. It had a lovely sweetness that paired well with the soft bread interior. My an pan was generous with the red bean filling, and again, the quality of the bake was top notch. Lastly, I enjoy eating shokupan by the slice - it is amazingly soft, and despite appearing to be a 'plain white bread' it has quite a nice depth of flavor that's subtle and quite enjoyable. If you gently toast a thick piece of shokupan, it will have a perfect surface crunch to FLUFFY interior. My grandma loves this style of Japanese bread.  I saw that they were bringing out tarts with strawberry and chocolate, but darn was on my way out. \\n\\nFor business updates, you should check their facebook page. I'm not sure what their hours are quite yet, but last I checked they were opening at 8 pm, with the goal of a 7 am opening with 6 am drive through possibility (which would definitely be the hook and sinker for my fiance who has to get to work by 7). \\n\\nThere is plenty of parking, and they have sandwiches for a lunch menu. \\n\\nI guess Oyatsupan is a big deal because from what I know of there are no Japanese bakeries in the Portland metro area. Having grown up near Sawtelle and frequenting Little Tokyo down in Los Angeles, I'd been pretty spoiled. The quality is comparable as well, so to me this is worth getting excited about! For those of you who aren't seeing the big deal or aren't hyped up, Best Baguette has asian baked goods, and Uwajimaya or the asian food marts might stock something sort of in the vein, but really, it's comparing apples to oranges.\\n\\nWelcome to Beaverton, Oyatsupan!!

Loves it! We just went here for father's day- what guy does not like some good red meat?!? Well I am glad that my dad enjoyed it. Dad, Boyfriend, and myself went over for some early dinner and had a great time. I had read about the garlic rolls on Yelp before and just as the reviews said... fantastic. I had 3 of them! The dinner was priced well $19.95 for a hot and cold buffet and all you can eat meat. The meat that they walked around with was beef, beef with garlic, lamb, kielbasi, Brazilian sausage, chicken wrapped in bacon. They also had chicken hearts but luckily they steered clear from our table... I think they 'knew' how I would react to that. \\n\\nI thought the buffets were good. The cold buffet had salad, fruit, a tomato/cucumber/onion/pepper salad, mozzarella salad, etc. The hot buffet had 2 types of rice, two types of beans, fried chicken, baked bananas, fish, veggies, Brazilian stuffing, stews, french fries, etc. So my favs... the tomato/cucumber salad, thick cut bacon, baked bananas, yellow rice, fried chicken. And the broccoli and carrots were pretty good. But warning.... don't fill up on the buffet, save room for the meats! Don't be an amateur!\\n\\nThe guys that walked around with the meat were nice. There were times of some confusion when one of us said we did not want something and they thought were were speaking about the table instead of the person speaking. But once we got them back we got really tender meat. The meats were flavorful and tender. Once I got a piece of dry chicken but even then dryish chicken wrapped in bacon is okay. Bacon makes everything better. \\n\\nOn top of that our waitress was great. While it is a buffet and guys with swords walk around she was nice, explained the process to us, quickly refilled drinks, etc. She got a total kick out of my dad who INHALLED the chocolate mouse dessert ($4.50). He saw someone else at another table with it and decided he would get that and when she came over to see if we wanted any desserts he quickly informed her it would be the chocolate mouse. The chocolate mouse came in a chocolate cup and served with whipped cream- to which was gone from the plate pretty quickly (dad loves chocolate).

So, good service to them seems to be leaving people with lots of time to themselves, rather than nosing in regularly to check on how you're doing.

The catfish po' boy.  I asked our waiter his recommendation between the shrimp or catfish po' boy and he gave the catfish a strong preference.  I agree the catfish was very good.\\n\\n2.  The potato chips.  Freshly made on premises.  The chips are made with good quality potato and properly done.  \\n\\n3.  Draft beers.   Nine available including four craft brews.  Cold and clean glasses with beer properly carbonated.\\n\\n4.  Ambience.  We visited many years ago when Pirates Cove.  The interior is an attractive bar and grill.  Clean, comfortable and well maintained.  No complaints.\\n\\n5.  Our server was Joe.  He was prompt, had opinions, but didn't check back til we were over half done with the meal.  We would have liked to had condiments for the chips sooner.\\n\\nFour areas for improvement:\\n\\n1.  The shrimp gumbo.  The consistency was muddy.  Gumbo had been heated so long that it needed more liquid, a lot more.  The flavor was okay, the shrimp and andouille content acceptable.  No rice.  I wouldn't order again.\\n\\n2.  The bread.  Po'boy bun and chicken sandwich bun were decidedly ordinary.\\n\\n3.  The chips.  Although freshly made with good potato.  Our chips were bland.  Needed more salt and spice.  \\n\\n4.  The drive.  If you are going to get customers to drive to Galena you need more hook than we experienced.\\n\\nMudflats is close to being a destination.  I hope they close the gap."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Unfortunately, anything good about this place is overshadowed by the fact that it's overpriced.

The hands-down standout was the Bobotie Bunny Chow --- flavorful, aromatic, sun-in-your-belly kind of food. Then it went downhill. The Ostrich sliders were dry (even very lean meat should not be this dry), the ravioli was so flavorless that it broke my heart. The (under seasoned) Fried Chicken was good, but not great, and served on top of some really thick grits that were lukewarm at best when the plate reached our table. The wine list was well thought out and we really enjoyed the Pinotage.\\n\\nThe 4 plates plus one cocktail, two glasses of wine and some sparkling water added up to $110 before tip...so this was not an inexpensive meal.

They recommend a house sauce to go with the fries, which is basically a lite chipotle ranch.  The food comes out on metal trays with wax paper, which is neat because it gets really messy and you will need all the room you can get.

When my food was presented, the person at the counter gave me a bottle of something dark and soy-like, which she curiously referred to as \\"hot sauce.\\"\\n\\n2) My $1.50 organic egg was served fried, over, and hard.

The Peking combo has the duck skin on top of freshly fried chips, which were not soggy at all, the diced duck meat with celery other bits, hoisun sauce with small leeks and cucumber, half a head lettuce, and lots of wraps . Delicious! For the other two, we ordered oyster pancake and gailan. We also added the sweet and sour pork with friend milk.  There weren't a lot of bones in the pork, which was great, and they weren't tough either. The garlic gailan were the medium sized kind, which was perfect for the kids. Nothing special about the pan friend pancake, just don't expect it to be like  a Korean one. Think a combination of Chinese green onion pancake and the Korean kind: it's thin. But the thing that sealed the deal for five stars for me was the dessert soup. Usually at Cantonese places it's always red bean, which is boring after so many years.

However, if you want the most unbelievably rude service imaginable, look no further, you've found your place.\\n\\nI've been going to this place for approximately 2 years. One day, however, I ordered a dish I never received. When I politely informed the server that I had not received my food, she rudely insisted that she had put it on the table while I was in the bathroom and that my girlfriend must have eaten it. Mind you, this was $4 worth of tofu and enough that there's no way you would have eaten it in 4 minutes and forgotten about it. I ask again for my food and she begins yelling at me that we had received the food. We try one more time to get the food and end up getting yelled at over and over again. Basically, the entire restaurant heard us being accused of stealing $4 of food. Why on earth a long time loyal customer would try to steal $4 worth of tofu is beyond me. What felt like an eternity later, the cook finally came out and told us he would make us the tofu. It might also be worth noting that they insulted my girlfriend (in a racist manner) in Chinese (she is not Chinese) to my face with her sitting there. Incredibly rude and disrespectful.\\n\\nThis is by far the worst I've ever been treated at a restaurant. I don't think I've even been treated that rudely by a complete stranger in my life.

I will always update my review for a better visit in the future.\\n\\nI've been to NY and NJ diners that are 12 pages of omelettes to lobster. You can't provide that amount of inventory without a large walk-in freezer of frozen food. These NJ natives want to bring a smaller menu here to Columbus.\\n\\nSo you can see I went with Kym H, and her review is more glowing. Through a great deal of questioning, I surmise that this restaurants biggest hurdle is TIME. They have already started taking steps to regain more time by the help of commercial frozen food service providers.\\n\\nBefore ordering, I asked about breakfast menu items that were \\"signature\\" in house made items. Adding ground sausage to a powdered gravy mix does not count. \\n\\nAll the items that Dad makes are more aligned to dinner. \\"What does your dad cook, that made people say that he should open a restaurant\\"? Meatloaf. Meatballs. Cabbage rolls and more. Maybe not open for breakfast yet until you have a signature breakfast.\\n\\nI applaud Gee(son) for taking the time to listen to my thoughts. Meatloaf omelette will be on the menu tomorrow he exclaimed. Maybe a meatloaf benedict(but no powdered hollandaise). Meatloaf or meatball hash.\\n\\nBaking potatoes, and cubing to order on the griddle does not sound as time consuming as  limp, mushy frozen hashbrowns. Perfect your breakfast egg skills. Scrambled eggs or omelettes should not be so over-cooked that they are brown and rubbery. Yet another breakfast tie-in would be to offer a fried egg served over burgers or meatloaf. You read about Kyms comments on the burnt toast. No restaurant should ever want to put a burnt taste in a customers mouth. That will be the continued burnt taste throughout the entire rest of the meal.\\n\\nI admired the effort of putting Goetta on the menu. I've never had it before. I have no reference to compare. Apparently this is a staple of the Cincinnati area. I first ordered it as the Goetta Omelette. It was indistinguishable inside the rubber egg. Gee brought me a side order out of Goetta that was griddle fried. Oats, whole grain and sausage is an odd combination. I could not find a seasoning to it. I am in no hurry to try it again.\\n\\nThe staff is absolutely friendly and helpful. The dining room was very clean. Always bussing tables and wiping surfaces. The establishment does not resemble a previous Dairy Queen. This location could use a great diner. I hope it survives. The portions on other peoples plates were large. The prices are great. 1 fantastic made from scratch item, would be so delicious that it would justify a $10-12 price. Do 12 of those items.\\n\\nCut the menu down to 12 items offered at each meal. Change it daily to the chefs whim. If anything, get around town to see what other diners are doing.\\n\\nI look forward to updating this to a more favorable review."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went back this past Saturday, dined upstairs as downstairs was closed.

I had walked, driven and biked by this place hundreds of times, knew exactly where it was but had never been. I don't know why but on a frigid Monday evenings, my wife and I got into the car, headed to the edge of Inman Square and right into the place. \\n\\nUpon arriving we found a near empty restaurant. Pretty typical for a Monday evening. The hostess was very friendly and we ended up seating in one of the their dining areas, right in the middle of the place. In a room next to ours was the buffet were mounds of various food items were kept warm, and our drink orders were taken. \\n\\nI went with a Sagres Branca beer from Portugal while the wife ordered a caipirinha which came with a glowing ice cube. Both hit the spot, and we quickly grabbed our card and flipped it to the green side so that the gaucho chefs would become aware that we were ready to receive tableside service. In our case, the gaucho chefs  actually only consisted of one guy and he was quite inattentive and didn't come as frequently as we wanted. \\n\\nAnd while most places will offer upwards of a dozen various cuts of meat, this place only really had a bunch. They had the bacon-wrapped chicken breast which was our favorite of the night, some lingui√ßa, some sirloin, some pork ribs and some Brazilian sausage. No chicken hearts and only one beef cut it was. Unfortunately that also meant that I couldn't get any picanha (top sirloin) which is hands down my favorite Rodizio cut. No filet mignon or fraldinha (bottom sirloin) either. Bummer.\\n\\nThat being said, the few meats that I did have were pretty good. Especially that bacon-wrapped chicken which was beautifully cooked and was very juicy and flavorful. However it did take a long time for the guy to return with more meats, and we often sat there, waiting upwards of 15-20 minutes for our next bite of food which was a bit awkward, especially considering that the place wasn't busy. \\n\\nThe hot and cold buffet in the other room had a salad bar and a few Brazilian staples such as fried plantains, feijoada and farofa. But no hearts of palm in sight and honestly, none of it was very good. The fries were soggy, the parmesan flakes were old and dry and the entire buffet was by far my least favorite part of my experience there. The items were lukewarm and the entire thing was a bit sad to see. \\n\\nAnother missing Rodizio staple:  p√£o de queijo (cheese bread) however they did have some garlic bread (we had to ask for it!) which they roast on a spit and which was pretty tasty. It was good that we did our research and knew about it though because they clearly had no intention of hooking us up with any. Same goes for their divine and highly addictive grilled pineapple which is sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon and which was absolutely delicious and a perfect way to end our meal there. They did have other desserts but it just didn't seem worth it, especially considering how much you get to eat there.\\n\\nAll in all, I hope that this place turns their business around. A more attentive staff, a better hot and cold buffet and a slight decor upgrade could really make this a great place to eat but for now I'll stick with Fogo de Chao in Copley which is hands down my favorite place place for this time of dining experience and which really kills it everytime I go there."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"In from San Diego and my brother in law took me here proclaiming good pizza.

My buddy ordered the same thing, but instead got the beef rib. \\nSo..... this is why I give this place 2 star based on my personal experience \\nBrisket - super dry, I have to chug water down every time I took a bite. It should never be that dry. My friend got a quarter pound of that and he was doing the same thing. A bite, then water. \\nBeef ribs - my girlfriends ordered one and got a huge piece, probably costing a good $40-$50 for it (we wouldn't know because it was market value).  A good amount of that beef rib was just fat. They obviously couldn't consume it. My buddy and I shared his and it was okay. It was tender and okay. \\nMy biggest thing is that, brisket should never be that dry. I'm sorry. I'm not even upset I got the chipotle sausage when I asked for the regular one. I just wouldn't wait in line for this place again. There are other bbq options that are a lot more tasty for a portion of the cost here.

They also served us a few orders of their bread which paired with the mohamara perfectly. The mohamara really was flavorful and tasted great. In addition to the garlic sauce, they also offered a complimentary hot sauce that was awesome. I'm glad we had the hot sauce, because the safiha was pretty bland. The meat was ok, but the surrounding puff pastry had absolutely no flavor. \\n\\nMy shawarma was a complete disappointment; it was just dry pieces of meat. I'm not really sure how they could've overcooked it to the degree they did, but they really dropped the ball on that plate. On a positive note, the side of rice really was tasty, but $20 for tasty rice sounds steep. My gf ordered kibbeh bi laban (kibbeh balls cooked in yogurt) which was a far tastier dish than mine. \\n\\nWe ended our meal with tea, coffee and an order of baklava. The tea and coffee were tasty, but what the heck happened to the baklava?!? The tiny, dry and mostly flavorless pieces are nowhere near as tasty as they should be. The baklava at Epcot is by far the superior product. \\n\\nSo, we did receive nice service but I highly doubt I'd ever return here.

It came with a sweet potato biscuit. \\n\\nBrussel sprouts: I can't imagine them tasting any better.  They were incredible and our favorite menu item. \\n\\nBone marrow: i was most excited. To try these but they were just ok. Not bad but I didn't taste much of anything. Not a good use of calories for me. \\n\\nDuck fat fries with egg: good but i wouldn't get them again unless with a large group. \\n\\nPork belly taco: delicious.

Luckily the beer was on special, as they regularly charge $6 for R&B sleeves.\\n\\nOrdered the chicken burger with fried onions, the wait for food wasn't too bad considering the rush, however the food left much to be desired.  The burger was entirely too messy to hold itself together in any way, with everyone having toppings fall off.  Bit into a very very burnt piece of.. something.. that I had to spit out as it was nothing but charcoal.  The burger seemed to be very heavy on butter and fat and I felt a bit unhealthy during and after eating it.  Flavour was okay, but had a very strong sweetness to it that wasn't very pleasant.

Yes, be prepared for outdoor seating - a big plus, in my book (plenty of misting fans to help in the heat). \\n\\nThe menu is really unique and affordable. We tried the summer fruit salad w/ quinoa and homemade ricotta (delicious and unusual), the housemade pickles (pickled green beans? yes please!) and the jerk chicken po'boy. Maybe could have used a little bit more chicken since the roll was quite large, but the flavor was great and I even liked the 'slaw (and I am almost NEVER one for coleslaw). \\n\\nWe had the s'more for dessert, which was pretty intriguing. I still can't decide whether I loved it or was a little disturbed (sweetened lardo? hmmm), but the homemade graham cracker was pretty solid.\\n\\nDrinks were also good - my husband tried the Bee's Knees and was impressed, and we also sampled a couple of local beers. \\n\\nBonus: Contigo is kid-friendly, dog-friendly, just overall friendly! The servers might tend to get a little busy, but they seem to really care about your enjoyment of the food and drinks. And if you're unhappy with the wait - just play game of washers and chill.

I've had a lot of different dishes here and have been here multiple times, each time never disappoints. The spicy kalbi soup or dumpling is definitely a must try whenever you go.

My friend from California, who has been living in Austin for the past 3 years, also recommended this place (she said it was better than Franklin's BBQ, in her opinion). With over 1000 reviews on Yelp and getting 4.5 stars, us San Franciscans couldn't wait to try it!\\n\\nThey have an option online to order ahead of time. There is no minimum amount that you must order, so I would highly recommend this option. I think we ordered 1-lb each of brisket, pork ribs, and turkey, for 4 people. We also got Chipotle Slaw and Pinto beans for sides. The beef ribs was not available for online order, and their reply was since we ordered pickup for later in the day (5pm - they close at 6pm) - they could not guarantee a pickup. However, when we got there at 5:30pm, my friend asked if there were orders NOT picked up for the day - and we were ABLE TO PURCHASE THE BEEF RIBS!!!!!!! (insert wow-ghost emoji here).\\n\\nThe beef ribs blew me out of my tiny-California minded foodie bubble. I could NOT believe that MEAT COULD TASTE SO AMAZING!!!!!!!! The meat was sooooo fatty, and sooooo flavorful. We had really never had anything quite like it before. I knew at that point in time that I could die a happy woman. The other meats tasted wonderful too. I honestly cannot compare it to anything I've had in California - the meat does not even come close, unfortunately. I'm so glad to have tried this in my lifetime.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly, fast and efficient. I would definitely recommend the pre-order on their website ahead of time, especially if you are out of town guests. The regular line didn't seem too bad though, but I don't know how long they ended up waiting. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Their brick and mortar also has a tiny fine-goods grocery store, where you can buy beer (or you can buy beer at their counter too, separate from the food line). \\n\\nNote:  I did end up trying Franklin's BBQ a few days later. I would have to say that I personally liked La Barbaque slightly better, for its beef ribs. I would say that my opinion is not fair though, since I didn't get to try the beef ribs at Franklin's, since I didn't go on a Saturday. It is what it is. \\n\\nMIND BLOWN.

My wife and 3 of her friends went to dinner here a little over a month ago because someone was in from out of town. My wife and one of the girls had the chile rilenos the other two got something else. That night my wife got home, all was good and in the middle of the night she woke up violently ill. She was up all night sick. The next morning I immediately called the restaurant and in the mean time my wife contacted the girl who had the same food, and yes she too got very sick over night. When I contacted to restaurant I spoke to an assistant manager who apologized and told me the GM would be in contact with me that afternoon when he got home. I also called the City of Boston to notify them of this. Fast forward to 8 pm that day..I never heard from the GM. The next day, I called and again asked for him. He was not in till the afternoon, but surely he would call me right when he got in. Again...waiting till the end of the night and what do ya know...no phone call from the GM. I will never ever step foot in this establishment again. I wasn't looking for anything free, I wasn't looking for them to welcome us back in for a meal, I was simply looking for a sorry and to know that they would get rid of that batch of Chile Relenos and to be careful. As a food guy and someone who frequents many Boston restaurants I will make sure to never ever recommend this place to anyone I know and I will share the horror story I experienced with them.

It is as if you saw into my soul and created an culinary and atmospheric experience that would satisfy every one of my wants and desires. \\n\\nFirst, the location is ideal for me. There has been a serious lack of restaurants in our corner of Austin, so when I spotted construction of a new joint on one of my daily walks earlier this year, I got really excited! When they finally put up the name of the restaurant, I immediately went home and Googled it to see what it was all about. The drinks and food menu had me even more excited. Carefully crafted cocktails, including my favorite summer drink, the moscow mule, a beer list featuring local brews, and simple, seasonal food and homemade sausage sent my taste buds into high-crave mode. \\n\\nFast forward to last night when I finally got the girls together and we headed over to sit under the lights on the patio at Contigo. As we were a large group, we had the great chance to order a lot of dishes and try a good sampling of the menu. The moscow mule did not dissapoint, but as I make mine with the same variety of ginger beer (maine root), it was pretty much identical to what I serve up for myself at home. Not a bad thing at all, but that led me to explore more of the drink menu to try something I haven't experienced before. The contigo ranch swizzle was interesting. Definitely steer clear if you don't like smoky mezcal. The group favorites were the margarita and the pepino. The pepino was so refreshing on a warm evening, and deceptively strong. \\n\\nOn to food. Housemade pickles were perfect, as was the okra dish and the sweet corn and crimini mushrooms. I could have eaten three servings of each. The ingredients were so fresh and simple; not fussed with and the real flavor of the vegetables shone through. We were also a fan of the crispy green beans, and I think we ended up ordering another plate of those to inhale as quickly as the first. My friends were fans of the quail legs, pigs in a blanket, and gulf shrimp, though I was too focused on the corn and okra to grab a bite. \\n\\nI was really happy with my dinner of rabbit and dumplings, though it was a little heavy for a hot summer night's supper. I was a little envious of my friend's chicken and tomato dish, and we agreed that it was the star of the evening. \\n\\nThe staff was excellent, and so patient with our group that had trouble making decisions, and spent way too long trying to figure out the check. (That could be blamed on our over-enthusiasm for the margaritas and pepinos, I'm sure)\\n\\nI look forward to many more perfect nights at Contigo.

I can't say enough how amazed I was with the catering.  I have been to and organized enough Christmas parties to know that restaurants tend to chintz out when it comes to events like this.  Two Chefs and a Table gave us first class service and eats. I would recommend them to anyone wanting to host a similar event.

The food is hit or miss, the service is typically abysmal. They consistently seem understaffed or simply inattentive. That said, last night was an all time low. The family was sat within 10 minutes of arriving (even though we called ahead to see if there was a wait). After being sat, we never once saw a server. After 15 minutes and the kids getting antsy, my wife hailed the hostess. She said she'd get someone to the table. 5 minutes later, I had to walk up to the hostess stand and remind her nobody has been to our table - nobody has even strolled through our section. Finally, after getting an earful from my wife, we decided to walk out. I reminded the hostess on the way out nobody had showed up to our table. She seemed clueless. Cross this place off your list if you have children. Actually, cross this place off your list if you care to eat or drink. For the record, my wife and I were veterans in the food service industry. We understand getting slammed, or taking a break out back, or any other valid reason for not seeing our server for a time.

I think the Boulder one is better looking inside and out. \\n\\nThe server tried to sell us on the buffet, but my lady wasn't interested in pizza (but she held a gift card here, so here we are) and I didn't want to play pizza buffet roulette. If I can afford it, I want to precisely choose what and when I eat. \\n\\nThe wings my lady ordered were very good, even with the sauce on the side. The garlic cheesy bread is another matter entirely. I should mentioned I skipped breakfast and hiked all the way to the Royal Arch and back before coming here, but I still will stand by my declaration that Beau Jo's cheesy bread is the best version I have ever tasted in my entire life.\\n\\nI also ordered an Orange Creme beer, because I like orange creme and I was curious. I fully expected to be a sweet mess and would pass it to my lady to enjoy. Instead I was served a beer that was a creme ale similar to Boddingtons with orange peel and flavor. It was wonderful.\\n\\nI know Beau Jo's is famous for it's mountain crust, but I would love a middle ground between thick and cracker thin Prairie crust. Still, the thin crust was tasty and was generous with toppings. \\n\\nThe deconstructed cannoli dessert was an inspiration. Cannolis have a couple issues. One is most bakeries prefill them, so if you don't buy them when a store opens, the crust is soggy. Another is that some bakeries only fill the ends with italian creme cheese, leaving the middle cracked and useless when you eat it. Beau Jo's created a dessert with a martini glass filled with cannoli filling, plated and surrounded by cannoli crust cookies dusted with powdered sugar. It is a wonderful solution to the cannoli problem, and unless you are in a big group, you can enjoy this dessert as leftovers for the next couple days."},{"name":"Bangkok Bistro","address":"433 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Came here last night and found that it is a hidden  gem.

It has since sold, and new management has the best of intentions but not as firm a hold on staff as previous ownership.\\n\\nIf I added up the amount of $$ I spent over the years at SB it would be in the thousands.  Not because they are the best sushi ever, but because they have a few things that they have nailed that the others just didn't get.  \\n\\n1. They honor the customer.  The customer is welcomed personally - not just yelled at in Japanese when they walk through the door.  They remember what customers prefer and if you go there a couple of times, they will ask you if you would like your favorites made up specially.  -That is customer service - remember that, folks?  It feels gooooooood.\\n\\n2. They keep up with the trends.  If the other place is making a new specialty, they soon will have that favorite as well.  It's called competition and they are all over it.  I like that.  There are NO other places in the area that will do that regularly and as part of their M.O.  It's good for business - I can go there for ALL my favorites.\\n\\n3. They offer Bento and other non-sushi plates.  I could not get my husband to come until I PROMISED him they had cooked food that came on a large plate.  He was really happy when his food came.  We come together for sushi and bento now...it's good to diversify your market.\\n\\nNow for the not so positive.  The staff (and guys, you're great, really. Friendly, well meaning folk.) are NOT trained well enough to be left alone all day, day in and day out without supervision by a sushi expert.  Because of this, the restaurant has become grimey.  This is too bad.  Lots of customers, including myself, will walk out when they see a filthy sushi restaurant.  Unfortunately, that's what I saw upon my last visit, and I haven't been back.  \\n\\nCaked on scum around fridge handles is unacceptable.  Scummy walls and kitchen curtains - unacceptable.  Even a layer of gray dust on the curtain over the food conveyor belt - unacceptable.\\n\\nAdditionally, I was absolutely horrified to witness one of my favorite chefs prepare a stuffed mushroom by taking the fresh, unwashed mushroom straight from the safeway bag and pull out the stem and stuff it.  (Mushrooms are grown in worm casings and feces) No washing in sight.  He did this with the whole bag.  I don't think he grilled them all...just prepped them with krab and ...... mayonaise.....a.k.a. bacteria breeding material.  So while these little nuggets of love are sitting in the fridge, they are multiplying bacteria that may, or may not be cooked off.\\n\\nFolks, a sushi restaurant is one place I don't want people messing with the food.  There are too many risks already.  The food must be PRISTINE in order for it to be sushi quality.  These two items were a fail and they happened very close to the date I am posting this review.

I'm used to shredded beef or chicken as choices so it was a little different. He ordered the picadillo and they were good, but half way through the second one the tortilla shell became soggy and the whole flauta was just falling apart.

We were immediately greeted by the waitress and asked us for our drink orders. (So far, pretty on par with everything else). There was no drink list yet, and I was excited about having a nice frosty beer after this long day so I asked for a water and a beer list. Come to find out that there is nothing on draught here, only a small list of bottled garbage. (Here's a point off). \\n\\nMy buddy raved about the steak tips here so this is what I order. A little, cheap, sad looking salad preceded a long wait for my food. Food finally came. The steak tips were good - cooked and seasoned well. A small portion of fries accompanied my beef. The main course was just okay overall. The check took for ever to come - and it seemed to be an inconvenience to get change for my buddy's mother. \\n\\nOverall, the service was less than average and our waitress had a touch of an attitude. The wait was long, the side dishes were terrible. The only saving grace was the steak tips and even then - they weren't anywhere near the best I've ever had.

That being said, I didn't expect much when I pulled into the oddly positioned parking lot directly across from popular adult playground, Midtown Bowl. However, having fought my way through the always nightmarish Atlanta traffic and having heard radio advertisements about $5 drinks, my friend and I walked in cautiously, but with hunger-fueled optimism, and sat ourselves at the bar.\\n\\nWe were greeted by the very friendly, but inattentive and dreadfully forgetful bartender, Stephanie.  She ran down the list of the day's specials - $5 well drinks, $0.50 wings and a handful of select $5 appetizers (including a cluster of crab legs, quesadillas and chicken or fish tacos). The place was empty, save for several bored employees taking advantage of a small hookah, but it took well over 15 minutes for my crab legs to be served.  Despite the wait, they were undeniably flavorful, perfectly steamed in Cajun seasoning and served with a ramekin of melted butter.  \\n\\nMy friend ordered the baked tilapia and opted for accompaniments of spinach and macaroni and cheese.  Again, the flavors were excellent, and the fish was well prepared, but for an empty, full-service bar/lounge/restaurant on a Wednesday evening, service was unduly delayed and slow.\\n\\nNaturally, every place in Atlanta has its own unique recipes for wings, so I opted for a few of the lemon pepper variety.  Having sampled a few of the other menu items, I do suggest foregoing the wings, here.  They were tiny, and at $0.50 per wing, that's to be expected, but they were cooked a little too long, leaving what little meat existed on the bones overcooked and undesirable. If you're particularly in the mood for wings, you'll fare better around the corner at Taco Mac.\\n\\nI had hoped for an experience more like that of what Room Service Lounge aspires to be - a hip, bustling lounge catering to individuals in the 9 to 5 crowd looking for a polished place to relax - but it has missed the mark.  After all, the place touts itself as a lounge, but the music was beyond lounge level; I found myself screaming at my friend seated directly next to me and wanting to scream at the staff.\\n\\nHowever, in spite of the building's exterior and its idle staff, where Room Service Lounge does find success is in creating a decently comfortable space in which patrons can drink (albeit, at standard prices), catch up on the latest in sports by viewing one of several large screens located throughout the space, and enjoy a menu featuring both typical and atypical bar food.  Offerings such as oxtails over rice, pasta, seafood, and an array of traditionally Southern-prepared vegetables give diners options far outside of the chicken wings/chicken fingers sphere, and for that, I can certainly appreciate Room Service Lounge.\\n\\nNOTE: Wednesday night is Biker Night at Room Service Lounge; the same specials mentioned above apply to all patrons and guests, but be forewarned - the DJ only plays music that has been specifically requested by the bikers and does not take kindly to requests.  The group of bikers, themselves, however, are incredibly friendly."},{"name":"Cedar's Restaurant","address":"7732 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Really nice atmosphere and the food was wonderful.

The first time I went was with a group of four and our server, Greg, was very knowledgeable and excited to tell us about the food. I really appreciate that in a server and it's kind of rare to see. This first time visit was more of a casual drink and small plates visit, but it got me excited to come back and try the food. I ordered the 5 O'clock Hero cocktail (Gin, Green Chartreuse, Lemon, Blackberry) and it was amazing. I had to stop myself from ordering about three more. We did order pate but as a vegetarian, I didn't partake. The rest of my group raved about it though.\\n\\nThe second visit was much anticipated and my boyfriend was just as excited as I was. I got the 5 O'clock Hero again (whoops!) and we started off with the crispy green beans which we LOVED. Maybe I'm biased because I want almost all of my vegetables to be crispy and dipped into a vat of aioli, but I was loving them. After that it was onto the spicy watermelon and the eggplant/squash dish. Both of them had just the right kick (the miso with squash was addicting!).\\n\\nAs vegetarians, we were disappointed by the two veggie options for entrees (one being a salad, oh brother), but it's a fairly small menu and I can roll with that. We went for the fries and grilled cheese. The fries? Awesome. Killer. There's not a couple around that appreciates housemade fries more than us. The grilled cheese? Pretty disappointing. There was SO much bread and it was overall just...dry. I didn't even finish all of mine (the two of us shared) because I got bored with it after the third bite. It needed...something. Moisture? Vegetables? Different bread? Different cheese? Pretty disappointing.\\n\\nWe had room for dessert and went for the yellow cake and frosting, since I am a chocolate addict and the server recommended it over the others. But there was yet another dryness problem. The cake was only saved by the chocolate because you can easily drown anything in chocolate and I'll still eat it. But the cake itself definitely needed some work.\\n\\nLike I said, I'll be back. I loved their cocktails and small plates and the restaurant itself is so visually interesting.

We probably spent an hour and a half here and $150 (with tip) per person- we also got a bottle of wine. The service was minimal and they had too many people in the rooms- I could hear everyone's conversations. We were probably a foot from tables on either side. If they took out tables (1-2) yes they would have made a bit less money but the ambiance would have been noticibly different. We felt like we were being fed on a conveyer belt from the way they were moving the reservations to tables that way and being fed in the same manor. Of course we tipped the full amount but our server was barely there (maybe had a lot of tables) but the bus servers were quick to clear plates. The food was amazing, which is the reason I would come back here.

The crazy prices would outweight any small improvement.  \\nLet's start out on a positive note...The ambiance here is really neat.  It's several floors and we were seated upstairs.  It's very cozy without feeling squished...Definitely a nice restaurant for a date.  The view from the room upstairs was very pretty too (since Mamma Maria is up on a hill in North End, you can see some of the tall downtown buildings from the 2nd floor).  One issue I had was that it was hot in there!  Now, I am the type of person that is usually chilly but by the end of dinner, my contacts were so dried out from the heat that I could barely make it down the stairs without one falling right out of my eye!  Anyhow, I digress...\\nMy friend and I each really enjoyed our appetizers.  The arugala salad and the spinach ravioli were both fantastic.  We both opted to order Frutti di Mare for dinner and that was a disappointment.  It was surprisingly small, the fish and shellfish in it were overcooked and it didn't have much flavor outside of the tomatos that were topping it.  I would have been pretty ticked off if I had paid full price for that dish.  Again, though, were were impressed with dessert...The espresso panna cotta was to die for!  \\nI think my biggest gripe with Mamma Maria was the service.  Our order was taken right away and our appetizers followed shortly thereafter but our entrees took almost an hour.  My water glass was also frequently sitting empty (and it's not like I was chugging, although maybe I was because of the intense heat!).  All in all, we were there for about 2 & 1/2 hours.  That's just too long if you're not intentionally dilly dallying and chit-chatting with friends.  \\nI honestly feel like there are so many many fantastic restaurants in North End that I probably won't be back here.

The big problem to start was that, unless you patrol yelp as a full-time job, or drive by TCC you might not know they exist. We only knew because last night we had some Philly grinders across the street and saw this place. They really need some marketing big time being tucked away in this little odd strip mall.\\nWe are huge cheese fans! Huge worldly (European mainly) people. So many great cheese, and something I've said Boulder has needed, a sandwich shop. Not a deli, but a sandwich shop. We browsed the menu and it seemed like a great place for us, sandwiches, cheese and in Boulder. Upon further inspection we noticed some holes.\\nFirst- half of a take n bake baguette with Brie isn't worth $5, let alone $7.50 when you add 2 ounces of turkey. Why not offer some more add-ons like fig jam, olives etc to add to the sandwiches? I think I can go to Whole foods, buy a freshly baked baguette, some brie, natural turkey and some figs for $7, and still have figs left over! To me, a restaurant is value added when there are multiple things going on. Want to replicate a chipotle burrito? That'd cost about $25 to buy everything, then you have to spend 1 hour making it, so $7 for a burrito is a great deal. Here, I can buy a baguette and brie and replicate the same meal for cheaper.\\nSecond- this is just me nit-picking, but why have a sandwich with Serrano ham, manchego cheese then put balsamic vinegar on it? If you don't have or want Sherry vinegar, then don't offer a vinegar, have piquillo peppers instead to be truly authentic. Also, don't charge me $12 for this sandwich, unless there is about 4oz of ham and 2oz of cheese.\\nThird- as a cheese shop, you should make sure things are labeled correctly. This is not only at the store but on the website. Roquefort is a Sheeps milk cheese and it's labeled as cows milk. Ok, who would notice or care? Maybe only me, but if you are a cheese shop, you should know what your cheese is made of.\\n\\nI worry about the survival of TCC, with trader Joes open offering the same types of authentic cheeses at 1/3 of the price, they can't rely on cheese selling, and they need to jazz it up in the sandwich department to make it work. I know you're run by a corporate ideal, but I want to help you all out! I want to see a great sandwich shop in Boulder that doesn't sell Subs or whatever it is you'd call Subway.\\n\\nThe people were friendly and happy to let you sample cheeses, which was nice and very cheese counter-esque.

Once the sauce had been on my plate for about 5 minutes it soaked the eggplant so everything was just a big soggy mess. \\nMy friend next to me got the shrimp scampi and her shrimp and vegetables were sitting in about 2 inches of sauce that really just looked like garlic butter (disappointing if you're looking for something healthy).

The first time was with a party of 13 people and the second time was with 10. We ordered a lot of dishes. Here are some of the dishes we got from one visit:\\n\\nDaai Leung Zha Chui Nai - This is the Tailiang Crispy Sticky Milk. This dish is also known as \\"Fried Milk\\". It consists of a bunch of fried cubes that you dip in a sweet white cream. \\nTsing Chao Dau Miu - This is the Sauteed Pea Pod Stems. \\nJu Yim Sin Yau - This is the Salt and Pepper Squid. \\nGing Dou Pai Gwat - This the Imperial Pork Ribs. This is a pork chop doused in a slightly sweet and reddish sauce. \\nSi Jap Leung Gwa - This is the Bitter Melon in Black Bean Sauce. \\nHong Siu Ban Nam Bo - This is the \\"Hon Sue Fish in Pot\\". This is probably my favorite dish. \\nBat Zhan Dau Fu Bo - This is the Bean Curd and Eight Delight in a Pot. \\n\\nThe bill came to a little more than $120, including tax but not including tip. For the second visit, here are a couple additional dishes I was able to eat:\\n\\nYuen Yeung Chao Fan - This is the Yuen Yen Fried Rice, which is this rice plate that looks like a Yin Yang or a Tai Ji Tu symbol. \\nJu Yim Gwat - This is the salt and pepper pork ribs. \\n\\nI found the fried milk to be okay, did like the sweetness of the cream. Sauteed pea pod stems and the Imperial pork ribs were fairly tasty. The Salt and Pepper Pork ribs were not great. I thought they were over fried and did not detect much tenderness in the meat. The Salt and Pepper Squid was just decently good and had the right amount of saltiness but lacked some spice. As for the Bitter Melon in Black Bean Sauce, I thought it tasted a little funny. The Bean Curd and Eight Delight was not a great dish. Some of the seafood inside was tasty, but the meats inside tasted extremely bland. The Hong Siu Ban Nam Bo, of course, was tasty and it was probably the dish I enjoyed the most. The fish was tasty but the vegetables were fairly soggy. The Yuen Yen fried rice was pretty good despite the sauciness. Liked the flavors of the red and white sauce. \\n\\nOne great advantage is that this place is open until 4 AM, so it's not a bad choice after a night out in the city. \\n\\nOverall, I found some of the dishes to be decent, so-so, and \\"ma ma dei\\" and some dishes to be somewhat tasty, which makes this restaurant probably not high on my recommendations in Chinatown.

My boyfriend and I went here before an event at Fenway on Sat Jan 4. We had a 15 wait to be seated which was totally reasonable (should have tipped us off that there was a wait with ample tables available).  We sat at 6:30 and had our food picked out because we reviewed the menu. \\n\\n6:45- waiter (named Kyle according tot credit card slip as he didn't introduce himself)  comes to our table to finally take our drink order. We devised a plan to put our food (apps and entrees) in as well because we had a funny feeling if it took 15 mins for a sever to start our drink order then who knows when he's be back. We started ordering and noticed he wasn't writing any of this down. Now working as a waitress myself for 4 years in college, people who don't write orders down ( and we got no olives, extra cheese, blah blah ) are either secret brain surgeons working a part time job or people who think they are smarter than they are. You decide.\\n\\n7:00- Drinks and one out of two appetizers (winga no nachoes) delivered by the bartender.....\\n7:15- No nachoes or entres or waiter in sight\\n7:20- We politely asked our sever if the nachoes were coming and he was extremely smug with his reply \\"ya....they'll be right out\\" At this time he didn't walk over to the kitchen like any normal server would to maybe check out the deal\\n7:30- No nachoes or entres again. We now make the decision that since our event started at 7:30, we'd pay for the drinks and apps but just need to collect the bill and we the hell out of that place. We ask Kyle again who\\nalmost seemed irritated that we were bothering him. We just said we know you're prob busy back there but we'd just like the nachoes and our bill because we need to leave. He said \\"ok\\" \\n7:40-No nachoes or bill. My boyfriend went up to the hostess as no manager was in sight. He explained we don't want to cause issues but at this point we can't even get our check nevermind the food. She was very sweet and was first person to actually seem concerned at this issue. She ran into the kitchen and grabbed our server. He miraculously appears with cold nachoes and the bill. \\n\\nI'm really disappointed not only for the obvious but also it was concerning to me that our server wasn't phased or concerned over what was happening. The bill came to $45 (my boyfriend had a $15 margarita) and we left him $5 . Normally we're 20-25% tippers.

The establishment is basically like a hole in the wall with about 10 small tables and a small television inside. Everything is reasonably priced for all under $10. Their protein choices are very expansive. They have a condiment bar with more than twenty condiments of toppings and sauces for your entrees. If you order a drink from their fountain drinks, there are NO refills. What...okay. The food here is authentic as stated by my friend.\\n\\nFood: I placed my order at the counter and waited until they called my order out for me to grab it on the side next to the soda machine and condiments bar. I ordered a steak quesadilla that should have came with rice, but they gave me a salad of shredded lettuce, tomato, and two slices of avocado that were way pass ripe instead. The avocado slices were very mushy. I ate two bites and didn't even touch the rest of my salad since it was not appetizing. The size of the quesadilla is larger in size than your average quesadilla in diameter. However, it was very difficult to eat it since it was falling apart each time I picked it up for a bite. I packed and boxed up the other half of my quesadilla for later to eat. \\n\\nOverall, I don' think I would make the drive to dine here again since I live way closer to authentic restaurants on Buford Highway. I would only consider coming back for lunch to try their tacos -- which are now advertised about $1.50 each for protein and all the toppings that you would normally have on your tacos.

With such a nice environment, I expected a higher bill, but the prices here are so fair that I would come back again and again; I wish I lived in Boston. My food has always been more than satisfying it's downright impressive, their take on escargot is fantastic I've got it every time I'm there. As for an Italian dish I discovered my all time favorite food for the first time at Assaggio, the Spaghetti Carbonara. The Pesto cream is also excellent. They do simple so well that I would not change a note of flavor anywhere. Each time our server has been very kind, the service itself has been prompt and we are always welcomed with a smile. Being much younger than most of the people that go to nicer restaurants, you sometimes get treated differently but that is not the case at Assaggio, they treat my girlfriend and I with the same respect as their much older patrons.\\n\\nSo if you're one of those yelpers, especially that one star review writer, you clearly are griping about something other than the restaurant and taking it out on this wonderful establishment, shame on you!

Usually if I'm going to pay for someone to make me breakfast, I would not order the usual eggs and sausages because that's something I'd whip up at home. But in this case it was an exception because of their home-made sausage (delicious with sweet dijon mustard) and the perfectly sweet ham. I whole heartedly agree with all the other reviews regarding their perfectly combination of a beautiful cozy space and yummy food to make you forget about the rest of the day. Next time I go back - their chicken and waffles. It was definitely the most popular item on the brunch menu.\\n\\nAlso can't wait to go back to try dinner and do another review. But during the holiday season, they are so booked up with private events in and outside the restaurant, that you need to call ahead to see which day they have regular dinner service.

Giorgio's was the first place that treated us normally: took our names over the phone, seated two of us as soon as we arrived, showed the other two to our table a few minutes later. \\n\\nWe knew to expect huge portions, so ordered conservatively -- as a bonus, our server advised us well instead of trying to sell us more than we could eat. As it turned out, two entrees and two sides was still more than four of us could finish, but it was a delicious problem to have!\\n\\nThe star of the show was undoubtedly the housemade cheese tortellini with bolognese sauce, to which we added slices Italian sausage. This is at least as decadent as it sounds: we were all starving and still struggled to polish it off. The meat was tender, the sauce perfectly seasoned and the pasta a perfect al dente. By contrast, the chicken cacciatore was tough and dry, although the sauce and pasta were as delicious as in the other dish.\\n\\nThe sides of broccoli and spinach were fine, but a little underwhelming: the spinach portion was rather small (it shrinks a ton when cooked, but they should know that) and the broccoli a little overdone. The garlic and oil were okay, but we added salt, red pepper and Parmesan to up the flavor.\\n\\nWe appreciated that they had some reasonably-priced wine choices, and altogether we paid about $30 each for dinner, which wasn't bad for the area.

It's your usual Chinatown service, so the waiters may forget a few things, and it can be a little hard to communicate with them (unless you're Chinese), but in the end, they get the job done.

She kind of just passed by us a lot and it forced us to have to signal her for nearly every interaction.  We weren't asked if we'd \\"like something besides water;\\" instead, twenty minutes in, we eventually asked if we could order cocktails.  When those got delivered and we were about half way done, we signaled for her again so that we could order appetizers.  We were finished with them all before we could stop her to order our entrees.  Also, our plates sat in front of us long after we were finished dinner and we were not offered dessert.

For example, tempeh bacon, tofu egg, seitan meatloaf? Even if it tastes good, I don't think great vegetarian food necessarily has to be this way.\\n\\nSure, it's supposed to be a diner, so why shouldn't there be eggs and \\"bacon\\" on the menu? But almost everything on the menu is some form of imitation meat. And while the food is decent for what it is, it lacks creativity. Severely. I know this because I live with a strict herbivore, and among all the foods we've cooked at home together, we've never had to turn to \\"fake\\" meat to satisfy our appetites. I myself, however, am not a vegan, but I tried a tofu egg omelet (\\"Cambridge Street\\" for $8.95) just to see what it was like. It tasted and smelled like egg, and it was actually pretty good. I will admit they do a good job at taking vegan ingredients to mimic lots of things a vegan would otherwise never eat.\\n\\nMy partner had a \\"burger\\", or more precisely a chickpea burger (\\"Central Square\\" for $8.95). He said it tasted more like a falafel. Therein lies the problem (or a potential solution?), at least for me. Why not just put delicious falafel sandwiches on the menu instead of trying to make everything taste like meat?\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared a banana cream pie. It wasn't the best dessert I've had, but wasn't the worst. I give it 3 stars because it really is just what it is --not great, not bad.

I've been here about eight times since it opened.  My first experience was just OK  (I thought the food was way overpriced and the menu pretentious); my second experience, after the urging of a friend to try it again, was excellent.  The third and forth time, again, excellent.  The menu changed here and there, and it seemed to me the prices were adjusted; this is to say, the management responds to feedback, and they just made it better.  This is one of my three go-to happy hour spots; they have very tasty cheap gourmet eats.  The four course meal deal cannot be beat in town for the quality of the food and the attentive, polite, and well-dressed wait staff.\\n\\nI did have one bad dining experience here, and that was when I made a reservation for six (bill came to $300); we were seated right at the entrance and next to the kitchen.  The room was unbearably hot and it was so loud I couldn't hear the conversation at the table; the service this evening was also pretty bad---the guest of honor never got his drink.  Based on this one experience, I'm not sure I would recommend \\"reservations\\"----I think I would just show up and hope for a table that was not in the front seating area.\\n\\nEven with the couple of not so great experiences, the other six times I've dined here have been more than awesome and a great experience.  What really REALLY recommends this place is that the wait staff DOES NOT RUSH YOU.  There is no sense of urgency for you to \\"get lost\\"--they wait on you  patiently and make you feel welcome.  Frankly, the food could be just mediocre and with that kind service I'd give it a good grade.  But here the food is GREAT.  So I say: Go!

The lunch and dinner menu are fine too, but breakfast ( with real eggs ) is where this place really shines. Little touches like quality bread for the toast and fresh preserves instead of crappy packets of jelly make all the difference here. While the breakfast menu is small, the combinations on the menu are both interesting and delicious. My current favorite is the Western Ave omelet. Brussel sprouts in an omelet have never tasted so delicious!\\n\\nI tried the tofu eggs once. They were passable, but if you're a vegetarian and not vegan, go with the real eggs. \\n\\nAs far as lunch is concerned, I still find it amazing, but I can see how people without vegetarian / vegan dietary restrictions may find it OK at best. The options are fantastic for healthy eating. People who are looking for taste and flavor without regard to fat and calories may find themselves unsatisfied with vegan sandwiches. I guess it really depends on what group of friends you bring to this place.\\n\\nDesserts are delicious. The Taza chocolate pudding is rich, thick, and amazing.

Thank you for making our first time Boston experience so wonderful ! And on Valentine's day to boot !  \\n\\nI dined here with my partner on Valentine's day (Sunday) during a weekend trip to Boston  and picked this restaurant in particular after extensive research on here due to their awesome reviews and the many recommendations for people to go there and order the Sunday Macaroni. As per usual , Yelp did not stir me wrong !  I was lucky to book by open table in advance and snag one of the few reservations remaining for Valentine's day. The reservation was for earlier than I wanted , but that turned out to be a blessing because we were in and out before the place got crowded. \\n  The place is fairly small, but very quaint and cozy with a modern/casual flair. Most of the tables for two are extremely close to each other so you do have to be comfortable with the proximity, but the couple dining next to us was super friendly and gracious so that was a plus.  As for the service , it was good ...nothing outstanding but nothing to complain about either.  The wine list is long and the wine bottles are very affordable , and we ended up with a bottle of Malbec that was really tasty. I also love that they take the time to write out on the menu which of their dishes pair better with the different wines .. makes it easier for someone who is not well versed in wines to be able to choose a bottle. \\n  The food , OMG the food !!!  My partner started with the Calamari which she said were amazing , and I am unfortunately allergic so I can't eat it .  I ordered the Sunday Macaroni because well ...after everything I had read about it in the reviews , I had to see for myself. My partner settled for the Crazy Alfredo . Sunday Macaroni ..how do I love thee ...let me count the ways ..Outstanding dish and an absolutely huge portion definitely good enough to share.  This dish is worth every penny  and then some , it is a perfect combination of what would otherwise seem like a hodgepodge of food mixed together. It is one of the best dishes this FOODIE has ever had , and I consider myself like a certified foodie lol . The short rib meat was like fall off the bone tender, the meatballs were big and hearty, the sausage was good , and the giant macaroni was delicious ... all together this is just an outstanding dish and I really can't say enough about it except ... it is worth taking the trip to Boston to Carmelina's just for the Sunday Macaroni !!!!  My partner loved her crazy Alfredo , and although she didn't realize that it would be spicy, she said it was just so amazingly good that she managed to eat it even though her heartburn had been bothering her , but she said it was worth it . The server suggested adding extra Parmesan cheese to help offset the spice of the dish and so maybe that way It wouldn't bother her as much , and this worked ! \\n As already stated in several other reviews , they don't serve dessert , but yes Mike's pastry shop is right across the street and other local pastry shops within a 2-3 block radius so it was a perfect location to do just that, get dessert elsewhere after your meal. \\n I will give them extra props for the fact that although it was Valentine's day and they were starting to get busy and are a fairly small place, at no point did we feel rushed through our meal or rushed to leave. My partner loved my pick, and kept telling me that it was an excellent choice !   Prices I feel are also very reasonable because for Italian fare , we managed to stay just under $100 for two people but that included a bottle of wine ... which is an overall great value also when you consider the big portions and the yumminess of the food. \\n  I am from NYC and if i were to go back to Boston , this place left enough of a good impression on me where I would have to make a stop to return , and YES I MOST DEF WOULD ORDER THE SUNDAY MACARONI AGAIN !"},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite item on the menu is the breakfast sandwiches!

This place is great for small plates. Seriously, super small plates. Delish though! \\n\\nMy favorite thing about the Salty Sow is the hype surrounding it. In a town with a booming food scene, it is important that locals follow what's trending. Everyone loves pork and the salty sow delivered just that to me. The no holds bar focus on fatty foods made me feel comfortable and slightly more Texan. It is great to see restaurants connect with the community the way the Salty Sow has. The decor is gorgeous and from what I believe comes from a local artist and is made from reclaimed wood. \\n\\nThe food really is good. A little pricy but let's not forget that pork this year is in shortage due to last year's poor yield of pigs.

I have heard that it's just as good if not better than Franklin's. It may be hard to find some parking nearby if you aren't there early, since I parallel-parked outside someone's house. I got there around 10:30 and was like sixth in line. It took them a while before they actually served their first customer, around 11:20. If you'd like to skip the wait, apparently you can order a head of time through the phone! Like all the other reviews said, they do serve free great-tasting beer to those who wait in line, and sometimes they come by with free samples. They have maybe no more than 20 picnic tables for you to sit down and eat. A lot of people like to bring their dogs with them!\\n\\nI ordered half a pound of brisket, half a pound of pork ribs, and the cajun coleslaw. The brisket was a bit salty for my taste, but I suppose that's inevitable, since they have to season such a huge chunk of meat. It was very tender, it had a nice smokey flavor, and the fat was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The pork ribs were really tender and well-seasoned, but in my honest opinion, I didn't think they were anything special. The pickles they served on the side were delicious; they were very acidic and had a kick of spice to balance out the rich heaviness of the barbecue. No one in my party thought the cajun coleslaw was anything special. It was just very spicy coleslaw that didn't really add anything to the tasting experience.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend going early, since my party was the last to receive the sausages and turkey, and again, I was the like the sixth person in line. My friend said that the beef rib was better than the brisket, and the sausage was fat, smokey, and delicious.

Our table was not finished being set until after our appetizers arrived. Well after we had finished them and the table had been cleared we reminded the waitress that we had yet to order an entree and frankly she seemed surprised that we wanted to have dinner. We were serviced by our waitress about three times over the course of 2 hours, each time to take our order or be reminded to ask for our order.\\n\\nI wished we had wrapped our evening up post appetizers, which were actually quite good. My $30 entree, however,  arrived over cooked, over seasoned, and laying on a bed of browned ice berg lettuce.

I didn't have room for dessert, because the meal was filling. \\n\\nI like the TILT vibe. On a not so cold day, one can sit out and grab a decent meal. Their burgers are tasty and juicy. But it didn't wow me. It is pretty much at par with any good burger joint. Or maybe I should have ordered something else. It was missing this kick in the flavor (but these are just my crazy taste buds, they keep searching for flavors that will cause explosions of pleasure in my head and some places although good and by no fault of their own, just cannot do that). \\n\\nYea, my standard of flavorful burger has been set by gastro mania. So it definitely didn't beat that. But the day I am craving a hearty burger meal, I wouldn't mind stopping at TILT.

Each place has its merits. I think Anna's merits are the wide variety of syrups (Banana being my current favorite or the orange in the \\"Borgia\\" mocha), free wi-fi, and acceptable food. I've had their pulled pork sandwich on occasion and while I've never cared for the pinkish kinchi that comes as a side, the sandwich itself is quite satisfying. The wait time for freshly prepared food can range from about 7-25 minutes depending on how heavy the to-go coffee traffic is because there is normally only one staff member in the whole place. The narrow space behind the counter would get pretty crowded if there were many more than one. The cold, pre-wrapped sandwiches they offer are...unusual (especially the ones that come with an inch thick layer of avocado slices) and often rather dry. The baked goods are usually plentiful, but range in edibility. Yeah, the scones are dryyyyy, but there's a fruit cobbler bar... thing that I keep coming back for and the brownies have nuts in them, which is as it should be.  Also, none of the goodies are labeled, so sometimes what you think are chocolate chips turn out to be raisins or something as yet unidentifiable.  \\nThe one drawback to Anna's is the irregular service. The staff are just as varied as the syrup flavors, so one afternoon you might get a perfectly friendly and helpful person or you might end up with the guy who all but ignores you as he makes your drink, only to then stare at you moodily through his black thick-framed glasses while you pay because you interrupted his smoke break to patronize his place of employment. As far as coffee caliber goes, I found it perfectly fine. The amount of syrup you get in the flavored drinks can fluctuate though, again, depending on who is manning the counter.\\nI can't speak to the alcoholic offerings as I have not tried them.

I remember good memories in the past, but I found myself generally craving other burgers place over Five Guys. Today, I decided to see how things compared to my memory.\\n\\nThe best thing about five guys is their many toppings you can choose from without being nickel and dimed. I almost always prefer my cheeseburgers with bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, pickles, caramelized onions, and mushrooms and so this is what I ordered here.\\n\\nI received my $8 burger rather quickly. To my immediate dismay, the pickles were in one stack on top of each other. That's okay from McDonalds, not from a place where you pay double. However pickles not being spread out is no huge deal, the bigger issue was a lack of seasoning. It needed a significant amount of salt and pepper to be correct, very disappointing. The bacon did not have enough saltiness to make up for the lack. The bacon itself however was crispy and well rendered, though I found their choice to pre cut them into 1\\" slices odd. The onions were fine, the mushrooms were a bit on the grey side and not hot...as if they'd been cooked a while ago and set into a bin to be used as toppings. These few faults alone had me set to give Five Guys a 3 star.\\n\\nBut wait. One third of the way through my burger I realize what else was missing. The fucking cheese! No wonder things tasted further off that I expected! I brought my burger to the counter, and they were nice enough to not give me any crap and to remake my order with cheese. It's just not the same without cheese!\\n\\nI received my second burger. This time it was cooked by someone different, but still greatly lacked seasoning. I honestly can't remember the last time I had a burger at a fast food place, cafe, or restaurant that needed this much more salt. It's like they literally put none. After a few bites, two things were felt. The cheese was not good, as in it was low quality. It reminded me of Kraft singles, but somehow worse. There was this offputting high that I have not tasted in a very long time. It's not an issue of simply being American cheese, as P Terry's uses American cheese that's tasty.\\n\\nIt was the first time I had ever liked a burger more without cheese than with! EVER. I really love cheese too, it is my favorite food, so this was a disappointment without compare.\\n\\nOh but the fun doesn't stop here. My remade burger didn't have bacon! Unfortunately I was already full, didn't want to have the order remade again, and frankly was fed up.\\n\\nFive Guys exceeded my expectations in how much fail could be delivered."},{"name":"Hy's Steakhouse & Cocktail Bar","address":"637 Hornby Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My fillet mignon was cooked to perfection!!

Hipster commercial drive type young waitresses with cute attitudes came by promptly with coffee and water (they did so throughout our visit - never an empty coffee cup).  Place was cold initially but warmed up quickly (remember this building has been around for decades so the place itself is nothing to look at).  It took a bit to take our order as they took them according to who was seated first (which is totally understandable).  The place is tiny therefore tables are relatively close together and you couldn't help hear your neighbours conversations.  We ordered the special (sausage eggs benny with salsa verde) and the super trucker breakfast (yes the crispy pork belly isn't for peeps who don't appreciate a nice whack of fat) with jack daniel's maple syrup.  Both were tasty and awesome.  What was extremely cute was the waitress came by with a sunny side egg on the side and we said we didn't order it ... she then says 'one of your eggs on your super trucker was broken so the kitchen made you another one' ... found that to be the coolest gesture ever.  A few things to note ... you get all types of peeps in the hipster East Van eatery ... you get obvious yuppy types, skaters, old, young, alternative, etc. ... sadly during our visit we found out a table walked out without paying their bill ....

Cozy, bright, clean, fun art on the walls and service has always been great. The owner is personable, friendly, charitable and easy to talk to - but doesn't suffer fools (which I personally also love... more on what that means later). \\n\\nI usually stop there after a weekend run with friends. I'm sure we stink (especially in the warmer months) but Derby Joe has always welcomed us without judgment or snide remarks. (And believe me, they certainly have the right to in the middle of August when we come in like a pack of smelly dogs). \\n\\nAfter the first time at Derby Joe, the owner remembered my name - all our names. (As someone who is horrible at remembering names unless I interact with that person daily, this is like a superhero customer service strength). \\n\\nOne time, one of my friends ordered and then realized she forgot her wallet at home. He said \\"just bring the money back next week.\\" She protested several times, I even offered to pay for her order and he insisted \\"I know you guys are good for it.\\" Who does that anymore?! He also remembers your order. If you're a regular and sees you coming, he gets your coffee ready just the way you like it. (Better than that order ahead app at DD or Sbux). \\n\\nThere are plenty of great local coffee houses in Salem, but this one is my favorite. Great coffee, yummy breakfast sandwiches, solid yogurt/fruit parfaits, pastries from other local businesses, great personalized service... and they deliver! Oh, and their sandwich board outside always has something clever written on it that makes me smile. \\n\\nBeing a local business that cares about the community their in means they've also been involved in a variety of fundraising/charity events and have also made their views known on certain local political issues. (A lot of local businesses have with \\"Refugees Welcome Here\\" signs posted on their windows, for example). If you're seeing single star reviews on here, it's because a handful of people (most likely NOT customers) are upset that the owner didn't want to sign a petition that goes against their ideals... and pretty much told them what they could do with said petition, if you catch my drift. These folks had their feelings hurt bc their (unsolicited) petition was met with blunt denial. *cough* snowflakes *cough*\\n\\nNow, if you can't bring yourself to go some place bc of conflicting political views, that's cool and understandable. There are places I personally don't patronize (large and small) bc I don't agree with the ownership for a variety of reasons. I boycott, I might tell others why I boycott (on my own social media platforms) and hope others follow along. You know what I don't do though? I don't leave petty little one star reviews to \\"get back at them\\" - especially if I've never actually patronized the business. \\n\\nYou keep doing you, Derby Joe. A lot of us in the community have your back and appreciate your honest candor on a variety of topics (regardless of what our own personal stances on them might be). For those that want a place that encourages dialogue, the folks (staff and customers alike) at Derby Joe are happy to oblige and engage. If you just want to grab your coffee and go, you can do that too. If you want to come in trying to force some agenda at odds with their culture... well, good luck with that!"},{"name":"Victorio's II Winter Springs","address":"200 E State Rd 434","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"This a converted pizza hut Italian joint.

Everything was pretty heavy on the salt. \\n\\nOne of the desserts, the pear torte, was outstanding. The espresso flan sat with only one bite taken out of it. \\n\\nThe decor was very nice, but the room was pretty warm. It generally seemed very romantic and up scale.

I would have expected that the wait staff would be instructed to allow patrons to pass. Instead, they said, \\"coming through\\" rather than \\"excuse me.

My Beef Curry tasted exactly as a good curry should.  But spring rolls and the shrimp rolls were cooked in old oil and they just weren't fabulous. I went ahead and ate the Shrimp rolls, but the spring rolls which only cost $5 were just too bitter for my friend. So after trying to bites, she sent it back.  So when we got the bill, I informed the server that the spring rolls needed to be taken off. She refused to take them off saying there was nothing wrong with them.  She said if there was something wrong with them, normally they'd make new ones for us. So when I said \\"Fine, then just make a new batch and I'll take them home\\" she refused to do so and instead tried to bring us back the plate of spring rolls that had already gone back to the kitchen. When I told the gal that they were overcooked and in old oil, she argued with me. I finally said \\"You really shouldn't keep arguing with the customer.\\"  Her classic response: \\"I'm not arguing\\".  \\n\\nThis $5 dish maybe cost them $1.20, including overhead.  Our bill was $32.  For their lack of vision, they chose to spend a whomping $1.20 to CHASE away a customer, that, if satisfied, would spend that same amount an average of 5 times a year--on the low side for a merely casual customer. It's much more than that if the customer is more loyal and not considered \\"casual\\".  So, for $1.20, this place just chased away more than $150.  Sounds like someone's got some bassackwards understanding as to how marketing works. \\n\\nThe food tasted like Thai food should taste. Nothing remarkable and you don't have a real server there...just one person who floats--and is constantly \\"in the weeds\\" as they say.

I asked the bartender, who was very pleasant and efficient, which one she liked and was not as sweet, and she directed me to the \\"water cooler.\\" The friend tried the \\"another meeting,\\" TenOak's take on a Meixcan martini. So, um, while I enjoyed my water cooler, if that is one of the lesser sweet cocktails on their menu, holy mother of earth I don't know how anyone could manage to finish any of the sweeter $5 drinks (the mexi mart was sweet but not as sweet as my water cooler, so I'm looking at you, other drinks).

And that test is: can I make this at home.  If the answer to that simple question is 'yes', then there is absolutely no reason to revisit the establishment.  Most places, including our oft-praised, deeply beloved 'North End' fail this test, and fail it utterly.  I am reminded or attending one of these 'End' establishments - a hugely popular place with a line out the door - and passing an entire pallet of Barilla pasta on my way to the bathroom.  Why the dignified Bostonian eater falls for this nonsense is completely beyond me.\\n\\nAssuming the food is good (which we will get to in a moment), then the only remaining test for evaluating Italian restaurants is: it is affordable.  Yes, you can get a decent plate of pasta in Lexington or Belmont but you will pay $25+ and, more than likely, leave hungry.  There are a few exceptions to this rule e.g. if an establishment is Michelin-certified, etc, but otherwise cost is an important factor; the food must compete fairly on price, and if it does then only quality remains.  \\n\\nWhich brings me to our dining experience at Twyrl.  Twyrl specializes in fresh hand-made pasta - I think it's the only thing they serve - and it passes the first test; unless you are a seasoned chef with specialized equipment, you will not be able to do what Twyrl does at home.  The pasta is truly fresh, and truly hand-made, and it is truly delicious. They only have two noodle shapes, spaghetti and tagliatelle, but this is common in the few places that actually make their own pasta.  \\n\\nTwryl's sauces are good, we had bolognese, creamy pesto, and carbonara.  Since most Italian places do not bother to make their own pasta, they compete only on their sauce and I think there quite's a bit of effort here to make the sauces unique because (again), with Italian if you can make it at home then it's not worth going out.  As such, it's a bit of a double-edged sword; the sauce should be tasty with a bit of mystery, but not so mysterious as to be weird. \\n\\nI do think Twyrl sauces pass this test; I thought that, perhaps with a fair amount of experimenting, I would be able to recreate the pesto and bolognese, and they are worth recreating.  Carbonara is a specialized dish; it is hard to make correctly, and the flavors in the dish are acquired.  No two carbonaras are ever the same so the diner should be truly open to trying something new; if you've expecting Mom's carbonara when you go out you will be disappointed every time.  Wife had carbonara at Twyrl and loved it, other diners had a different experience. I do believe the expectations and not the preparation may be the issue. I also find it hard to fault Twyrl for having a dish on the menu that reaches a bit, I would prefer that over spaghetti with meatballs.\\n\\nDinner was 50 bucks for three, and that included cheesecake.  The style is simple, with simple tables, simple service, and a simple menu. For that price there is zero reason not to try Twyrl; if you like it, and we did, it beats the competition handily on quality and price and could become your local favorite."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Overpriced, small portions...loud..  too trendy for me.

We used the Dine Out (restaurant week) menu for lunch and expected to at least have a serviceable meal. \\n\\nWe ended up having overcooked Flautas de Langosta that didn't really have any lobster in them whatsoever. It was more like having a mashed potato taquito that's been deep fried. 2nd course was the Enchiladas de Conchinita Pibil which was smothered in so much salsa verde (way too much tomatillo and far too sweet) that we were both scraping it off of the enchiladas to try to make them bearable. Unfortunately for us the dried pork inside was no longer masked by the salsa verde. \\n\\n3rd course was a Tres Leches cake that essentially turned out to be a fancy looking shortcake. It was tasty and it may have been made with three different milks but it definitely was a far cry from a normal tres leches cake. \\n\\nThe ambiance is nice and it's a convenient place to dine if you're in the Seaport area for a convention or a meeting but I can tick off a list of places that will give you much better food for your money.

The decor was surprisingly dark and uninviting -- much like the rest of the newer complex. Thankfully, our cheery server was quick to grace us with the food and extensive wine menus.\\n\\nNow here's where TWB falls a little flat: the food menu. I am usually wary of restaurants putting out dishes that are scattered all over the place, and this place was no exception. From the Thai chicken salad to the scallops alfredo to the curried shrimp and mango flatbread, I felt as though the menu was anything but cohesive. The food ordered confirmed my initial hunch. While I immensely enjoyed the trio of fondue, I was not impressed by the juliette flatbread. (Spagio remains stalwart at having -- hands down -- the best brie pizza in town!) The interplay amongst the ingredients listed on the menu simply did not set foot in the realm of good. The triple chocolate pot de creme, however, was a delightful closure to our meal. I'd like to think of it as melted fudge served in a cup. One would be hardpressed to polish off the aforementioned dessert alone.\\n\\nVino-wise, I was slightly disappointed by the flights.

Let me explain, so we order a pizza that has prosciutto but my boyfriend doesn't eat pork so I told them to only put it on half. We get the pizza and it has prosciutto all over the pizza. Then the pizza has more crust than toppings! Customer service was horrible he called my boyfriend buddy 5 times. I work in the service industry and that is the worst possible thing to to say. It may sound nice and clever but it's not. It sounds rude and condescending. The place looks gross as if they hadn't cleaned the place in months. It's a shame that the same business that I enjoy at one spot is completely different at it's other location. It should maintain its reputation at every location. I still love their pizza but not the Congress location. I get that Austin tries to keep it weird but it's not an excuse to keep the place funky and disgusting.

We headed down to the alphabet district to grab something delicious. We were with some friends and found this good looking BBQ on Yelp. We decided to check it out since it sounded good to everyone. \\n\\nIt's super tiny, like 10 tables in a cramped space, but it smells divine when you walk in the door. Our friends brought their dog so we had to sit outside, but they only had 2 small tables outside and they were both taken. We decided to order our food to-go and eat at the park around the corner. We ordered 2 of the meat combo plates and were told it would be about 30 minutes. That seemed a little strange since BBQ is generally already cooked since it takes hours and the restaurant was so small, but we went with it. As we were waiting the 2 outside tables cleared out so we decided to sit and eat there. The wait staff came out and seemed a little annoyed at us, but it wasn't like our food was ready so it shouldn't have been that big of a deal. After about 40 minutes our food finally hit the table (I mean come on). \\n\\nWe had 2 small pieces of brisket, 2 giant beef ribs, and a chicken thigh. We were hoping to try the pulled pork but they were out. Our little one ate the entire piece of chicken, but the tiny bite I was able to steal was moist and delicious. All of the meat had dry rubs on them and there were 4 different sauces on the table. I really liked their regular sauce, it had a tiny kick but was also tangy and delicious. The brisket was tender and delicious, I just wish there was more of it. The ribs were good, they were gobbled up by my husband and the little one. \\n\\nI love BBQ, but the sides have to be good too. We had the baked beans and the mac and cheese and I was super happy with both of them. The baked beans were so good, I don't know what they put in them but they were cooked perfectly and had chunks of meat in them. The mac and cheese was also gooey and the bits of bacon really set it off. I ended up eating most of the sides and a few pieces of brisket, my usual.\\n\\nOverall, the BBQ was pretty good. I love that they list the farms where the meat came from on the menu. I would classify it as upscale BBQ, I'm not exactly sure how I feel about that because there's something to be said about digging in with your hands, but the food is good. I wasn't crazy about the service, they weren't super friendly and it seemed like the 2 people working didn't really want to be there, but we got everything we needed. If I went back it would be on a date night, without the kid and the dog, but I would probably go back."},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Fenway","address":"1348 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I think I'm addicted to the muffled trushroom pizza.

Um ok it happens. I ordered pancakes, a side of bacon & a side of home fries. My pancakes were served cold, the bacon was burnt and I never got the home fries. My dad ordered a bacon cheeseburger rare with nothing else on it. The burger he received was more than well done, and had plenty of extras included some kind of orange mystery sauce all over it too. He decided he'd try it anyway but had asked for mayo. Our waitress took his plate back and we waited another 5 minutes for the mayo. By the time she returned his food was now cold now. Never once did she ask how our meal was or even offer to refill our drinks. Our table had no napkins on it, and the maple syrup dispenser was so clogged with crap that it was stuck to the table and wouldn't open. We asked her to wipe it down for us, as we put it on the empty table behind us. She reassured she would and of course left it there. Even when she took my cold food away because I said I didn't want it she never apologized or offered something else in place of it. Are you serious? I know what it's like to wait tables as its my job and it's definitely not for everyone..we spoke with the owner who was cooking before leaving and she didn't seem interested whatsoever.

Steak tips: The fries were delicious and the steak itself was tasty but a little over-sauced. My friends didn't like the flavor but I enjoyed it. A little strong for their taste.\\n\\n2. Cacciatore with linguine: This was a heavy, savory dish. I was worried it would be too spicy but it was just the right amount of flavorful.

I was seated in the very back, which was a more relaxed environment. \\n\\nApple cider drink - Whipped cream, apple cider, and my memory fails me in attempting to remember what else was in this alcoholic drink, but it was on the Happy Hour specials. SOMETHING was definitely in there to make it a pretty strong drink, though. \\n\\nDuck fat fries - overrated, sadly. I love fries so much, but these were definitely overhyped. They're just like normal fries...and the bearnaise sauce was just ok. I wish the fries had come with a better dipping sauce. \\n\\nBrussels sprout leaves - NOT overrated. With all the brussels sprouts craze right now, it's hard to distinguish yourself when you have brussels sprouts on the menu. But these were quite delicious AND unique! The leaves were crunchy and made this a light dish as opposed to most brussels sprouts dishes (which are usually fried). In addition, the raisins added a slightly sweet taste to the dish. \\n\\nBananas foster beignets - I love all things beignets, so naturally I had to try this out. First of all, HUGE portions. I mean HUUUUUGE. Like not the size of normal beignets that you'd expect from Cafe du Monde...these were more like big apple turnover sized beignets. This comes with 2 beignets, which is plenty for two or probably even three people to share. I would say that these were not the best I've had, but they were okay. Innovative idea, but not well executed. The beignets were a wee bit dry, and there wasn't quite enough nutmeg ice cream to finish both beignets. I couldn't really taste the bananas foster part of it either. \\n\\nOverall, I'd definitely come back here again to try some of the other items on the menu.

Yeah, the hot wings are average size (and I always say that I don't enjoy huge wings but they're on the medium side so I was ok with it) and it was a bit on the salty side. I wasn't sure if it was my mistake for asking for lemon pepper sprinkles on top even though I didn't taste the lemon pepper at all or if it was just a bit salty to begin with. So, I'm probably just going to order regular hot next time. The wings are crunchy on the outside and if you like them extra crunchy, I'm sure you can ask them to crisp them for you. \\n\\nCajun fries, pretty good but the seasoning is way salty. Probably just going to order regular fries next time. The fries itself are crispy and well fried. Perfect. \\n\\nMaui pizza is their Hawaiian as you've probably surmised due to its name.

I decided to have the \\"street tacos\\", which were a little disappointing. These are basically two tacos with a load of seasoned meat.  Any vegetable you find is just a garnish.

The tacos come with rice and beans on the side, which were pretty good. \\n\\nOne of the main draws to this place has to be the 150 beers on tap; great selection of local, west coast, and international beers.

The portions are laughably big. If you are ordering the pasta, I would recommend splitting with someone - you may still have leftovers. Their salads are refreshing, and the wine selection was nice. I really like their menu: you pick the pasta you want, the sauce you want, and the toppings. It is very customizable, which is good for picky eaters.

I know I was horribly disappointed. Until I started eating it and realized that it had a simple, familiar, tastiness.

The gem lettuce salad is pretty solid but sometimes the bread is hard as a rock, or there is a huge pile of the radishes on top that overwhelm the entire thing.  The pieces are there but it's execution that is missing.  Second, the lamb spare ribs.  First time I had them they were out of this world, perfect size and balance of meat and fat and the fritters were soft and warm.  Second time I ordered the pieces were large and hard to handle / eat and way too much fat (and I like fat) and then the fritters were dry and tasted like nothing... Letdown for sure.  The sides are a nice addition and big enough to split or have as a pet of the meal.  The the mustard greens were insanely but the quinoa is solid and has yet to disappoint, it looks basic but flavors can be complex.  The cauliflower was solid and tasty.   The duck pate has been consistent and tasty each time.  I have not tried many mains to be 100% honest but there appears to be some nice things there I just enjoy a little variety served through smaller plates - oil be sure to try another main next time I am here.\\n\\nFrom a drinks standpoint the wine list is OK, not great not bad.  The mixed drinks are interesting and have the potential to be solid but again inconsistent - one week the old fashioned was perfect and delicious and in the right glass... The next it was served in a tall narrow glass and the flavors did not mix well and everything fell to the bottom, again potential but fell flat.  I was very happy to see they had the scotch Monkey Shoulder as its a hard to find and great value scotch I recently discovered in a trip to Scotland, but it's since disappeared from the shelf.  As for desert, only had it once and it was solid and left me very happy.  \\n\\nFrom a service standpoint the ladies of the house are happy and check in on you, but the guys need to check their attitude and take a lesson from the ladies working the floor.  I have only been here week nights and again sometimes even with a relatively empty dining room (I eat at the bar typically) service was great some night and others I sat there waiting for a gentleman who was working the bar to finish a side conversation with a waitress before I even got acknowledged or was offered a menu / drink.  There seems to always be some internal gossip or debate going on behind the bar which results in less than attentive service at times... I know it's new but let's not try to fix how things are running in front of your paying customers maybe?\\n\\nAgain, the word I would use is potential - a little more consistently and attention to detail on the food, and service and you have a success on your hands for sure even if the location is a little odd (in hotel)."},{"name":"Dolce Italian","address":"3035 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste A201","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"When they changed my napkins to a darker color and my boyfriend's remained a white one, I immediately felt good about this restaurant.

The coconut shrimp were delicious with the thai spicy hot and sour sauce, I probably could have ate like 20 of those.  The beef ribs were too damn chewy and hard to eat, there was barely any meat on these as well.  The brisket was rough and chewy, not soft whatsoever.  And the pulled pork was decent, how can you screw up on pulled pork?  The mac and cheese was velveeta so it wasn't anything new but the mashed potatoes had corn juice or something since it tasted like corn.. it was pretty good if you ask me since it's not your usual buttery mash.  Finished the meal with a complimentary pecan pie from uncle pete's wife, and the pie was delicious.  \\n\\nI would say the prices for almost all bbq joints are all about $20-23 for a combo meal and though the food i was not impressed with the service was fast and friendly.

I'm so glad I discovered this restaurant as it is both close to where I live and a good casual date place. This review will mostly focus on happy hour:\\n\\nOn Wednesdays, they give you a free ox tongue slider 5-6pm (1 per person). These are wonderful; they're crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, with a hint of acidity. So yums. \\nThey also make the most delectable crispy fried green beans. Yes, they get a little greasy at the end of the basket but all you have to do is dip one into the aioli and all your troubles go away. I can finish an entire basket myself.\\nI also love their burger and fries, which come with a garlic ailoi. The burgers are juicy, and even more so with an egg (though it can get messy). Don't bother with the cheese ($1 per slice? I'm sorry, do they contain unicorn tears?)\\nThe white bean dip, however, was not worth it in my opinion. It had a very distinct oily taste and was fairly bland. The table next to me was raving about it though, so to each his own. \\n\\nThe drinks are well crafted, but nothing extraordinary. $6 cocktails during happy hour makes me a happy person. I should also mention that there's always a large hoard of screaming children running around during happy hour. Sure, there's virtually no wait, but it seems to be a popular place to bring your kids in the afternoon when you don't want to watch them.\\n\\nTheir grilled cheese isn't worth it... too much bland cheese between thick slices of bread that weren't toasted enough. In addition, I don't understand why I even thought paying $10 for grilled cheese was okay.\\n\\nOverall, I do enjoy this place- I still have yet to try their rabbit dumplings but so far I'm perfectly content with ordering my favorites. The only thing during dinner is that the wait time is normally 40 min or more. It's also all outdoor seating (there's a covered area though it's still open to the elements), though they do provide heat lamps and a tent during the winter.

I am a bit of a matcha snob, so when I heard about Gen Sou En, I was so excited to check it out. I stopped in here one weekend afternoon after having lunch nearby, and the cafe was packed. The decor is gorgeous, and quite Instagram-worthy. There are cozy little nooks to hang out, and long bars where you can plug your laptop in and get work done. If I lived in the area, I would love to spend more time here. \\n\\nI ordered the cookie sampler (I believe it was $5 for six cookies, and I ordered a Yuzu cookie, which was excluded from the sampler) and a matcha latte to go ($6 with soy milk). For whatever reason, the employee behind the counter only gave me six cookies wrapped in three separate bags, which I noticed so I hopped back in line to get my missing cookie.  No biggie. The sesame and yuzu cookies were yummy, but the other cookies were very ordinary. Minutes later, the barista brings me my matcha latte in a glass cup...so I had to ask for her to pour it into a to go cup. While the two incidents aren't a big deal on its own, I can understand why there are other reviews complaining about major service issues when dining in...\\n\\nAnyways, my $6 matcha latte was pretty unremarkable.

I ordered the buddha's delight and found all the veggies fresh and crunchy. I usually don't eat the fortune cookies, but the ones they served were really yummy and tasted like a vanilla cookie. \\n\\nI found the inside of this restaurant much nicer than most Chinese restaurants I have been to and the staff was friendly. We went on a Thursday night and were the only guests and felt a little awkward that everyone could clearly hear our conversation. I would recommend going on a busier night if you don't want to be the center of attention. \\n\\nThe cons: we came for dinner and the dinner specials menu didn't include a single vegetarian option and specifically stated not to request substitutions. My boyfriend paid $1.50 more for his meal versus mine and was able to get soup, spring roll, and fried rice plus the meat and veggie component of his dish which looked identical to mine except it included steak.

There are a few other places in Austin that have interior Mexican food but I find El Naranjo the best - service, quality of the ingredients and preparation.

I do not even know if there is a word to describe my experience. To begin, Mamma Maria is set on a little square, and I could be in the heart of Rome. Sadly, it was raining when we arrived, so we did not wander around before dinner when it was still slightly light. The entry is slightly cramped, but I quickly forgot about it as a plate of food passed under my nose and all I wanted to do was eat.\\n\\nWe were taken upstairs, and had a nice view of the skyline. Our waiter, Dan, brought us warm bread with pesto and olives. The pesto was so delicate and basil-y. I could have eaten that all night. I ordered the scallops for an appetizer. They were beautifully seared, and wonderfully presented. I am all about the presentation of food. I eat with my eyes before I eat with my tastebuds. They were not rubbery, which can happen with pan seared scallops; lightly crispy on the edges, but golden brown. The fennel added a nice touch. I would have enjoyed a few more oranges, but they were nice none the less. My mom ordered the asparagus, which I was hesitant on, and I thought it had an interesting taste, but she enjoyed it.\\n\\nI ordered the Tuna for dinner, which was delicious. Out of this world. I was not impressed with the linguini however. It is a squid-ink linguini, and I do not know if it was the squid ink, but something just seemed off to me and the flavors did not mix. It did not take away from my experience and I was perfectly happy to just eat the tuna, which was more than enough food for me. The linguini was cooked with heirloom cherry tomatoes and garlic, which were delicious as well. But like I said, the tuna was more than enough, and it can be ordered on a bed of fettucini, so if squid ink is not your thing, ask for it on fettucini.\\n\\nMy mom ordered the Halibut for dinner and she could not stop raving about it. It was served on mashed parsnip, of which I had a bite, and it was outstanding. I am not a huge \\"mashed\\" anything person, but the parsnips were so good. A little sweet, but not too overwhelming and just the right thing to accompany the fish. I also must add that everything was very nicely presented.\\n\\n\\nMake sure you save room for dessert. I know it is the North End and everyone goes to Mikes or Modern Pastry, (or one of the dozens of places on Hanover Street), but it was raining and we opted to stay inside for dessert. You will not find the traditional tiramisu, profiterole, etc here. I ordered the Chocolate Torte Alla Nonna, and was blown away. I assumed (incorrectly) that it would be a slice of chocolate torte, etc. But oh no. It is served in a ramekin, warm, with a dollop of espresso gelato on top which melts into the torte and creates a mocha torte. It is deceivingly rich, but does not leave you feeling sick to your stomach. I usually like to just have bites of dessert, but I ate every bit of that torte. My mom ordered the Rum Baba, which I had never had before, but it was delicious. Deceivingly light, soaked in rum, crispy on the outside. Served with homemade whipped cream on top. Artfully presented and the bread just melts on your tongue. My mom will usually have a bite or two of whipped cream (she will eat all of her dessert), but she ate every bite of the whipped cream.\\n\\nI had a fantastic first visit to Mamma Maria. I would go back in a heartbeat. Our waiter could not have been more helpful and charming. Always smiling, very attentive, but not overbearing. Some places always seem in a hurry to turn over tables, but he let us linger as long as we liked. He was friendly, and was very helpful with menu selections. My mom was trying to decide between the Mushroom Pasta and the Halibut, and he said to always go with the seafood dishes because they are his favorite. \\n\\nThe decor was tasteful, simple, classic, the way I like a restaurant to be. It is set just off of Hanover, so the noise gets filtered out. When we first arrived, it was fairly quiet inside, but it got louder as more people arrived. But it was never at the point where you had to yell or felt like other people were drowning out your conversation. It was the noise of people having a good time at dinner. All of the staff were very friendly and always have a smile to give you.

I saw a hint of the chef trying to blend in southeastern Asian flavors (sort of Thai) into this traditional Japanese signature dish.. and the ramen was in a Korean Bibimbap container. Nice try but it can definitely be improved in terms of balancing the various cuisines involved.\\n\\nDesserts were conventional mochi ice creams, but there wasn't much of craftsmanship at all. Straight out of package, to be honest.\\n\\nYet the restaurant design and small decors were fashionable and pleasant.

This sub lacked flavor and was loaded with too many onions and not much of anything  else and could have used more feta cheese & tomatoes.\\n\\nWhile this sub was not good enough for me to order it again (particularly at $13.00), it was just okay enough for me that I would try something else from Rustica Pizza although I would not go out of my way to come back here."},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ordered a 3 meat plate. The brisket was excellent, the ribs. Average, and the pig cheeks unworthy of being on the same plate. Good sauces but service is as horrible as the parking. I won't be returning. Even though the burnt ends of the brisket is quite delicious."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Overall, I thought that the food was really good. We got the Midnight Train, Uncle Ron's with Mac and cheese and fried corn, and fried green tomatoes. The sauce that came with the fried green tomatoes was amazing and the chicken was hot/crispy. The only bad thing about the place is the wait. I came when it opened and the host told me it was a 10-15 minute wait, but in reality it was 30-40 minutes. Many people started to come in and when it started to get somewhat crowded, they made people wait outside in the cold. There were many empty seats, but for some reason they didn't want to seat people."},{"name":"Wasabi Grill","address":"398 14th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Tired it for the first time this week because of scoutmob and I will definitely go back again even without the scoutmob deal.  Great food that's very reasonably priced.  I had the beef hibachi fried rice, the portion was huge, I was only able to eat half of it.  But most importantly, it wasn't greasy like most fried rice.

We shared a pizza that came with just about everything on it.  It was fabulous!  We agreed that it was one of the best pizzas we've ever had.  The sauce had a unique taste and everything was fresh and hot.  The crown jewel was the garlic knots!  Oh my goodness!  SO delicious, hot and fresh out of the oven!  They melt in your mouth!  The service was quick and the waitress was so nice and had such a pretty smile.  Really made us feel welcome and comfortable.  We'll definitely be back."},{"name":"Waves Coffee House","address":"180 - 5951 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Likes: $2 medium lattes, location, space, service, outlets\\nDislikes: can be a tad pricey for other drinks\\n\\nBackground:\\nI went here on a Monday afternoon (3 pm) and stayed for two hours, in hopes to write an essay. The coffee shop was not busy, and people went in and out.  I brought my laptop with the intention to get something done! Did I? Read on.\\n\\nMy Experience:\\nI called ahead to make sure that they had an outlet. Tim Horton's on Bridgeport for example, does not have any. How is a student to study with a laptop? HOW?!\\n\\nThis Waves is new, and is located under London Drugs on No. 3 and Westminster Why. They have a garage for parking. Otherwise, it is very transit accessible as it is located in downtown Richmond. It's right between Lansdowne and Richmond Centre.\\n\\nI was a bit hesitant with their drink prices, which seemed pricier than Starbucks. The drinks selection was very similar to Blenz (across the street). I chose to go with their special, $2 latte plus 60 cents for a flavoured shot; I went with hazelnut. Duh.\\n\\nI appreciated how they practice latte art; my drink was topped with a leaf! The latte was not too hot, and they really fill it to the top of the cup. The medium latte lasted me my whole stay, so I had a very cheap stay, I suppose. The hazelnut latte was a bit on the bitter side, and I could barely taste the flavour.\\n\\nHowever, the baristas were friendly to their customers, and they greeted everyone who entered the coffee shop. They also put value in cleaning as I never saw a dirty table; they went ahead and cleaned every table after a guest left.\\n\\nI was listening to music the whole time, so I am not sure how \\"loud\\" it got. The shop was filled with business people on a meeting, and other students; typical of a coffee shop. \\n\\nThe place is very central, so it's a good place to meet at in Richmond. It's not in a \\"sketchy\\" neighbourhood, so feel free to visit and stay until they close.\\n\\nThey are open from 6 am until 12 am. No passwords needed to use their wifi. However, they use a code for their washroom, so make sure to ask the barista.\\n\\nI also appreciate how they have a meeting room good for about 6 people. However, you have to sign up for the room ahead of time (or not, if it's empty).\\n\\nVerdict:\\nI got my essay done, so I think for me it was just a pleasant place for me to write and focus on my readings. I will surely be back."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"11A Allstate Rd, South Bay Shopping Center, South Bay Shopping Center","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2.5","text":"Love this place Amazing staff and management!

My overall feel was the food was \\"pretty good.\\" However there wasn't anything that really made me say \\"I have to have that again.\\" It was an entirely enjoyable evening. There is not a better outdoor dining experience in Austin, in my opinion. You will want to stay and hang out. They allow dogs on part of the patio (a plus if you have well behaved dogs, but I don't, so I don't take mine).

The storefront, menu, and signage does NOT tell you it is vegan, so if you happen in, off the street, you will not know this. I asked the owner/manager WHY they don't declare that they are vegan on their advertising and menus, and his philosophical reply was that their food is so delicious, they don't think people can tell the difference.  LET ME ASSURE YOU, DUDE, PEOPLE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE, YOU ARE DELUDING YOURSELF.  But with that said, there are people who need food prepared this way, and while I am sorry for their plight, I am glad they can eat at a snooty place like this.  If you, however, do not digestively require super high-priced donuts prepared by privileged, vegan, gluten free hands, then don't waste your money at this pretty little empty-headed place. The food tastes simply awful. I repeat - AWFUL.  I have no idea why people are satisfied with it (lack of experience?), but I would never elect to eat their food again.  It made me cramped and ill for a full day and really annoyed that it was so expensive for such dreadful food."},{"name":"L'italiano's Restaurant","address":"5749 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2","text":"Nice person took my order and delivery driver was very nice, however the pepperoni pizza was at the level of gas station pizza, perhaps pre-made frozen.

The dish sounds amazing however it is quite disappointing. Both my mother and I have tried it and just did not enjoy it.

Interesting combination. \\n\\nPancakes with taza chocolate. I have to admit this taza chocolate is absolutely delicious! I also love the taza hot chocolate which I get every single time. I think I still keep coming back here only for this hot chocolate. \\n\\nThe dinner dishes I have had include:\\n\\nChipotle Black Bean Burger. This is a yummy veggie burger and I recommend trying this out if you haven't already. It is pretty good and very healthy.\\n\\nThe baked mac and cheese is phenomenal!!
