For little boys, the West Wing is the place to be for SURE as it's dark, creepy and had lightning and thunder sounds but is also gorgeous. Girls probably love the ballroom.

Especially on the weekends, you could be waiting close to an hour for a table. \\nMy friends and I made a reservation and had a great time. Hot pot is a wonderful, interactive dining experience. My friends and I got the half-and-half broth, which is the way to go. The veggies (corn, bok choy, cabbage, and lettuce) were fresh, although they can go limp if you lose them in the broth. The broccoli was also great. We ordered the chicken breast, which was great. In addition, we tried both the thick noodles and the glass noodles. I would recommend the thick noodles over the glass noodles as the thinner noodles are harder to fish out of the broth. For sides, we got pork dumplings, potstickers, and a sesame pancake. The sesame pancake was really the star of the sides (although the dumplings and potstickers were also delicious.)\\nAs the restaurant is always busy, the staff is quick to seat you and get you out; however, you never feel rushed. Even thought the staff is balancing multiple tables of large groups, our water glasses never went empty and our broth never went unfilled.\\nFor the three of us, we spent around $30 per person, which is a steal considering how much food we ate.

Quick service VS Sit down dining. However today I will be reviewing my most recent experience of the lunch quick service. \\n\\nI've been here for lunch probably 15+ times. I typically get the same thing each time and know pretty much what to expect. \\n\\nToday since I went with a friend we stood in the order line since online orders cannot split the check. This process while it didn't take forever did feel very slow. I felt the cast member was taking far too much time explaining the purpose of the rose location device. I think they should have signs prior as to how the food will be delivered. \\n\\nToday I had the kids meal: grilled cheese, I got a cookie instead of fries, small fountain drink, and I splurged and got the French onion soup. \\n\\nWhen my food arrived everything was plated beautifully. It was out within 5 minutes of sitting down at our table. However a bite or two into my sandwich I realized  half of the sandwich was missing cheese. I waved down a cast member and showed them, and they had a second sandwich brought our immediately. This time the cheese was cut long enough to actually fit the bread. \\n\\nThe French onion soup while pretty on the outside ended up having a serious flaw. It had a chunk of cheese the size of an adult fist in the middle of it. I could barely find any broth inside my bowl of cheese. I've had this soup before several times and knew this was not normal. Once again I found a cast member and explained the situation. I showed her the bowl and she admitted that was not typical and took it away to show it to the kitchen staff. She offered to bring me a fresh bowl of soup, expect this time I asked for no cheese. She was very apologetic and brought out a no cheese version of the soup several minutes later. Honestly in the future IF I order this soup, I will probably order without cheese. I did not pay $7.99 so 90% of the bowl can be a huge chunk of cheese. \\n\\nOverall my most recent experience at Be Our Guest was disappointing. I've never had issues with the food before until this visit. I hope it was just an off day. \\n\\nThe decorations are absolutely stunning and it's one of the nicest quick service options at Disney."},{"name":"Los Pinos Mexican","address":"4919 Hudson Bend Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"Why does this happen everywhere I take you??\\"  is what I asked the universe when I walked into this little dive restaurant with my lil ole lady friend and a waiter immediately came up and hugged her.

She's kinda hard to forget, it's true, but it's so sweet to see grown men just throw their arms around her.

Ever since they closed my beloved Curras North, I've been lost.   All you South people are lucky to have such succulent pork in your 'hood.  It is the standard by which all tasty pork is judged, imo.  I read on Yelp that they got it good at Los Pinos and upon sitting down I hardly cracked the menu.  I asked our new best waiter friend if they had it and then ordered it.  Lil Ole lady did same (she forgot her glasses and couldn't read the menu anyway).\\n\\nWas it the best CP ever??  Hardly, in fact I'm not sure it was Cochinita Pibil.  I've never had it with the pork in chunks in a rioja sauce  and served with chunks of canned pineapple before (and none of those yummy pickled onions I love).  Granted it was tasty, just not what I was expecting.  What blew my GD mind, as KK would say, was the super hot housemade white corn tortillas.  Holy mole they were good!  Also the rice was surprisingly tasty and the refrieds screamed yummy lard and bacon grease.  The margs were house tequila and meh as expected but the house salsa was good, a little salty and vinegary but that's how I like it.  \\n\\nI would definitely go back and crack the menu next time for other options.

He then sent the owner or the owner's grandson over Derek, who told us he could make our drinks doubles, and charge us, or bring us a shot, and charge us. This was unacceptable to us so we asked him if he would just remake the three drinks yet again. He did  but they were still terrible. We went on to order calamari as an appetizer which was delivered and we then placed our dinner order.

We made it perfectly clear to him that we had not walked out or we would not have left our sunglasses on the table nor were we intoxicated in any way shape or form. When we returned to the table they had taken away our calamari and did not offer to bring it back or bring us another order.

Who would have known, a conversation with an Ethiopian Uber Driver got me here. At first, seeing the scarce number of reviews I was a little skeptical but this is what I do to help my fellow restaurant enthusiasts. How did Sheger Cafe do? \\n\\nReview #055\\nRestaurant Type: Casual Dining. \\n\\nFood (65%) \\n Taste to price 4/5\\n Quality to price 4/5\\n Portion to price 4.5/5\\n Average = 4.17\\n\\nService (20%)  \\n Friendliness 5/5\\n Promptness 4/5\\n Average = 4.5\\n\\nCleanliness (15%) \\n Bathroom 4/5\\n Dining area 4/5\\n Kitchen area 4/5\\n Average = 4\\n\\nOverall Score = [F(.65)]+[S(.20)]+C(.15)]\\n  = [2.71]+[0.9]+[0.6] \\n  = 4.21\\n\\nThe Pluses...  \\n+ GREAT MENU. Easy to read. Simple layout with just enough images to make a sound decision on the order. Good variety for Ethiopian food beginners and authentic cuisine seekers alike. \\n+ Awesome customer service. I was greeted with a nice smile and the waitress answered my questions and even recommended me her favorites. \\n+ Feels much like a family business which I always have a soft spot for. \\n+ For the main entree, I had #18 THE ULTIMATE COMBINATIONS OF SHEGER CAFE and THE KITFO SPECIAL. See attached video. That explains it all. \\n+ Keep in mind, the KITFO SPECIAL is raw. If you're going to have Ethiopian food, you have to accept going raw (lol). I thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of flavor and fresh, red meat. The KITFO SPECIAL has got to be a staple to the order. \\n+ Great portions. If I'm at an Ethiopian restaurant and I don't take anything home, then it ain't an Ethiopian Restaurant.   \\n+ Great ambiance. Just like Habesha, there is a big screen TV playing contemporary Ethiopian music. Various Paintings/Photos on the wall are cool.  \\n+ Very CLEAN restaurant and bright atmosphere due to lights and interior colors. \\n\\nThe Negs...\\n- Not really their fault, but parking in the area can be a little tricky.\\n\\nThe Neutrals...\\no They don't have a real sign outside. It may be a little difficult finding this place since the previous tenant's sign (Oriental Market)  is still up. \\no I had the HONEY WINE. That was my first time having it. My best description is it tastes like a mix of apple cider vinegar and honey. A little too sweet for me as I prefer my drinks on the dryer side. Spoiler alert: there is no alcohol in it. \\no When you walk in you'll see a Traditional Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony Set which was pretty darn cool. Makes me wonder if they hold a ceremony on some days. I'd love to watch and drink it.  \\n\\nIn Conclusion...\\nThey opened about 5 months ago and it's still a relatively unknown. At less than 20 reviews, I have to say this place is very underrated and a very much a hidden gem. I'm glad I was one of the first to step foot. I owe that Uber driver a glass of Honey Wine and I will gladly come back here. In all, Sheger Cafe is a must visit if you're into Ethiopian foods. \\n\\n#ChowYouLater\\n\\n**If you enjoyed my review and need help with the Boston area, follow or add me as a friend.

But for the sake of this review, I'll quickly summarize our first visit here:\\n\\n-Arrived there and discovered they don't participate in BOGO Thursdays. \\n-Our server keyed in a random amount of boneless wings for myself and my husband, not what we ordered. \\n-Our food took FOREVER to come out- and they were not at all busy. \\n-By the time our remade food was finally ready and boxed up, we'd been at the restaurant for over 90 mins, and our baby was crying because she was so ready to go. \\n-We ordered (and PAID for) ranch to go with our remade food, so we left our half empty ranch at the restaurant. She assured us she put 2 fresh ranch dressings in the bag. We got home and there were none. \\n\\nSo about a month later we decide to give it another try. We did an online order, 2 medium orders of boneless wings, and 2 appetizers. We ordered 5 ranch dressings. My husband goes to pick up our order and asks if there are 5 ranch in the bag. The girl double checks and realizes there are only 4, but runs back to get 2 more. My husband gets home with the food, and I see the dressing bag says \\"Michael 4 bc\\" on it. Sure enough, it's bleu cheese dressing in the bag. So I call the restaurant, and it's the same girl who bagged our order. She half heartedly says \\"Aw, I'm so sorry about that. Let me put you on hold and get a manager.\\" 7 minutes later I'm still on hold and just hang up. \\n\\nPeople, there are bigger problems in the world than missing ranch dressing. I know it, you know it. But it's major component of the meal. Do you want chips without salsa? No. And neither do people want wings without their dipping sauce- that's why they sell it!

I'm sorry but shouldn't you be happy or at least nice when I'm a customer in your establishment?  So I decided to talk to the manager on the way out.  I wanted to provide feedback.  I was honest and direct.  I also acknowledged that I hadn't been there much in the past couple years.\\n\\nThe manager was defensive and seemed distracted.  She eventually warmed up and asked for my information.  I gave her a business card.  She said they'd be in touch.  Still waiting...it has been over 2 months.\\n\\nI'm not waiting anymore and won't be back.  And I will no longer recommend this establishment to any of my friends who visit Portland.  Stay trendy and rude but I don't need to be treated like an unwelcome guest to feel hip.

Not as flavorful as I would have liked, but it did its job. \\n\\nOther than the rice, I thought Habibi was decent. The dish I had was a bit too heavy, so be aware if you order that.

When we finished eating various dishes, there she was again.   \\n\\nI ordered the Maki combo, which came with 3 rolls... the typical California roll, spicy salmon roll and a tuna roll. I asked if I could switch out the red tuna for white and she said no problem. It also came with a bowl of miso soup and a green salad.  The price was under $16 for all of it. I thought the rolls would be tiny but they were good sized rolls with plenty of fish in them. \\n\\nMy husband ordered some nigiri sushi and a few Maki rolls. He had the yellowtail roll, Philly roll and the spicy scallop roll. The nigiri sushi had 1/4\\" really thick pieces of fresh white tuna and salmon on them. \\n\\nNicely sized portions of everything.

A favorite lunch spot in Lake Grove, it is a place where you need to dine early on a rainy day to grab a seat. The seating is cozy and really feels like a community table on a busy day, so love thy neighbor.\\n\\nOn a sunny day, you've got to eat outside on Pine Shed's picnic tables. They request (rather forcefully) that you order at the counter first before grabbing a table. A necessary request since they have a definite lunch rush, but I could tell it was a little offputting for some new customers. Food usually arrives pretty quickly and the staff brings water and keeps things running smoothly. Because of the tight seating, it is a little complicated when you are meeting friends for lunch who are arriving separately.\\n\\nI typically order the sandwich (brisket off the regular menu or tri tip if it's available) that comes with one side, a pickle spear and a bag of chips. So filling I usually end up taking some food home. If you go for the plate, you get a larger serving of meat and one side, plus cornbread.

I'm not gonna lie, I didn't read a lot of their reviews, but the ones I read I didn't feel justified not trying it out. So here I am. \\n\\nI was with a HUGE party of 16. The server was a cute, trendy female with such a calm demeanor that you'd never notice she was swamped. I have no complaints about the service whatsoever. Prompt, friendly, and helpful is what I received. \\n\\nThe patio was nice! Pretty secluded from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but in a cool area in the arena district. They had fun lights strung and the vibe was relaxed. \\n\\nOn to the food and drinks! My drinks were wonderful! I ordered a Tito's with cranberry & pineapple juice and it was THE BEST I ever had. It had pulp in it! It was so fresh, tropical almost. My food was great! I am gluten free and ordered from their gluten sensitive menu. I had salmon, fresh veggies (bell peppers and green beans), and kale quinoa salad. Everything was outstanding! I will definitely order this again! My salmon was perfect. The veggies were warm, saut√©ed, and the right size. I always feel like restaurants skimp on the veggies, but not here! The kale quinoa salad was heavenly! Kale can be quite bitter, but they put enough lemon and tartness in it that you can't tell at all; there are either cherries or cranberries in it.\\n\\nBy now you're probably wondering why I didn't give this place a full 5 stars? Well. My wife and her friends ordered some appetizers with chicken nachos being one of them. The tortilla chips were \\"incredible\\" (that's the word my wife used). However, the nachos hardly had any cheese! You can't have nachos without cheese! My wife ordered more and things were better. \\n\\nAlong with the nachos, my wife and her friends also ordered artichoke crab dip. It was amazing! However, when the bruschetta came out, it was burnt.... I don't think anyone ate it. For her meal, my wife ordered a double bacon cheeseburger with French fries. She loved the burger, but her fries were so garlicky that she couldn't eat them.... and she's Italian! \\n\\nAnyway, regardless, I will be coming back! I can't wait to try more!

When we were here for office hours last week they were so sweet to us letting us stay past closing. Their staff even seemed like a generally happy bunch.. not the eff you kind that wanted to cut us for taking up several tables in their upstairs. But when I stopped in this week, I decided I was just in serious like. \\n\\nDuring Yelp office hours, I had myself a mocha (which was good.. I don't have that many to compare to though), a macaroon (hmmm coconutty and fresh tasting), and a chocolate chip cookie.. ALL TO MASELFFF. Well no.. I shared. But it was delicious. It almost looked like a semi-failed cake masquerading as a cookie (obv. more complicated/puffed than a choc chip cookie). The middle was just the right amount of soft and the outsides were slightly slightly crisp. Perfection. \\n\\nWhen I stopped in the other day it was cold and rainy so I decided on a grilled cheese.. tossed in some ham for a little extra moola.. and some tomato bisque for dunking (naturally). The grilled cheese was really good.. but after working at my own cafe I felt the need to throw in spinach and tomato. Regrets.. maybe I can ask next time if they have the supplies. My napkin however was ill-placed under my sammy and the cheese compromised its integrity. No worries.. napkin dispenser to the rescue (which I noticed the upstairs didn't have during office hours. I used the decorative paper from a present to wipe my hands then.. lol). The tomato bisque came with focaccia and it was just okay. I'm not sure if it was because I was sitting under the ceiling fan (high ceilings though) but the soup was just warm not rainy-day-piping-hot-and-comforting. Was there a half sandwhich/cup of soup combo? That would have been divine. I wouldn't have had to hobble out (oooh tummy fullll) and perhaps I wouldn't have spent $10 (well it was $9 and change.. but the rest went into the tip jar of course!). Prices are okay but breakfast looks like a great deal. \\n\\nThe service was great. The cashier was very friendly and kept her eye on the floor, bussing tables when necessary. The dude that made my sandwich and scooped my soup offered me more bread when he realized the focaccia piece looked a little small. Thanks friend, but with the sandwich I was all breaded out. \\n\\nThe atmosphere reminds me of a friend's new apartment. Cute for now, but needs to get broken in a little bit. In the meantime, the fresh flowers at each table are a lovely touch. There are plugs (2 in fact) at all the tables in the upstairs but I don't know what the wireless sitcheeation is. The cafe is rather clean (as observed from one of their counter seats) but I don't know how I feel about the cupcakes and baked goods being exposed and out in the open. I mean Flour and Mariposa do it, but I just feel like cupcakes should be taken care of to maintain their moistness. Perhaps a glass cover to both protect and tempt? \\n\\nAnd I know Crema has lovely untainted windows that open during nice weather, but would it hurt to post their hours somewhere? Did I miss that? Oh and don't forget to bring cash, friends. $10 minimum for credit cards. Semi annoying since I hate carrying cash, but I know how it goes and they even post a sign saying that it helps keep prices down. \\n\\nHanging out between 3 and 4 stars for now..

After deciding I could not afford the flower selection, I started walking towards my car. I was yet again stopped by an employee, asking where the bottle of wine was that I was walking around with, my response being that I put it back. I am glad I did not buy my Mother's Day gift here. I highly doubt the employees treat every customer the way they did to me and I will never be returning.

It was a DECENT sandwich, I'll grant you that, but nothing special.\\n- The Pommes Frites that came with it would have been great but they were served lukewarm at best.\\n- Kind of pricey for what is essentially a quick service restaurant - yes, even for Disney.\\n\\nThere were also several elements of this experience that I wasn't sure about. For instance, the entire check-in/ordering process is...awkward. You check in outside, and if you don't have a magic band you get a plastic \\"rose\\". If you do have a magic band, they just send you inside. Where you check in again, rose or magic band. Then you either order from a computer (I guess if you're paying with your magic band?) or, if you are paying with cash or credit card, you go to a register and order from a person. I can see how this gets confusing because while we ordered from a cast member and were told to get our drinks ad find a seat, I'm not sure if the computers tell you the same.\\n\\nSo we got our drinks, found a seat, and waited. Not long, maybe five to eight minutes, but it was awkward because we weren't quite sure how they would find us. And the fact that they did find us - when there are THREE ROOMS you can sit in - and brought us our exact order was, to be honest, a bit creepy.\\n\\nMy friend had the quiche and just as a warning, the quiche is weak on the cheese and is kind of 'deconstructed'.\\n\\nAs for dessert, I had the cream puff, and while the puff pastry portion was fine, the custard inside was an extremely heavy/rich chocolate custard - not at all like your standard cream puff.\\n\\nI'm one of those people who went to DIsney enough in the good ol' days that the current direction they're taking with their restaurants disappoints me.

They don't so much as offer you ingredients for your pasta as dole them out in tiny little portions--especially the sauce, even when you pay for an extra (normal) amount you don't get what you paid for. The pasta is chewy and tough, the sauce so watery now it's more like broth. Even the bread slices are half as thick as they used to be. Yet the prices remain the same.

I came here for the first time on a Thursday afternoon with a friend and we were about to go to somewhere different because the place looked really busy. There are two floors to this place, so we easily found a spot on the second floor. You basically order first, grab your pastry (if you do get one), then wait to the right of the registers for your drinks or food. I got a regular iced soy mocha, the Crema grilled chicken sandwich, and the banana bread pudding. \\n\\nEverything was great! My favorite would probably be the sandwich. It was grilled to perfection with its charred exterior to make it a bit crunchy, while the bread was still soft. Inside contained grilled chicken, which wasn't dry, but very juicy, tender, and full of flavor. There was also avocado and corn, which just pulled together nicely. I wish I had known that they offered chips as a lunch special, but maybe next time! The iced soy mocha was nothing I've never had before. Pretty good espresso. But I tried a little bit of my friend's iced lavender latte and I wish I had gotten that! The lavender wasn't overpowering the espresso and just tasted so smooth. Last but not least was the banana bread pudding. It was honestly okay. It seems to be a crowd favorite at Crema Cafe, but there was just something about it that I didn't like 100%. I think it was either the sauce or the cranberries that threw me off. But besides that, it's pretty good warmed up! \\n\\nCrema can be a little too loud and crowded, but just pop some earphones in and listen to some music. The have outlets all around, so no worries there. I know that a lot of cafes don't have many outlets, which is annoying, but not an issue here!

However, I must share a little rant about the complete disregard in this city for the vestibule rule.  The function of the vestibule is to separate the inside warmth from the outside cold with a little cushion of air.  For some reason, people around here forget that they are cold-hearted New Englanders in the winter, and they attempt to HOLD BOTH DOORS OPEN for people coming in and out of many establishments.  Or maybe they're in a big rush, so they don't wait for the first door to close before opening the second door of the vestibule. That one fraction of a second totally screws over everyone in the restaurant or cafe.  This completely defeats the point of the vestibule, people!!! And it makes all the people inside freeze their little butts off!!!  So please, learn to use your vestibules!\\n\\nPhew... good to have that off my chest.  Anywho...

We waited in line just at the front door to the ordering area took about 10 minutes as promised and were given menus to look over while we waited. The line moved quickly. You are ushered into a small room with touch screen computer kiosks to order your whole meal from. There are staff available to assist with the process. Once ordered you take your rose to the dining rooms. You pick your own seat and can choose from 3 rooms. The beast's room that is dark like in the movie and has the rose on display, the ballroom or the library. We chose the ballroom because it was decorated beautifully for Christmas and the windows displayed snow falling. So pretty! Shortly after seating staff came around one by one with our meals. Those plastic roses we received had a gps tracker so they could find us. So cool! Everyone was helpful and friendly. They stopped by a few times to check if we needed anything. There are drink stations in each room and you can help yourself to refills which you don't see at many Disney restaurants. I ordered the Croque Monsieur which is basically fancy grilled ham and cheese sandwich. It was delicious and served with a side of fries. My friends ordered French Dip and both raved about it.

The real problem here is that the entire Bridgeport complex is poorly designed. There are certain foods that are easy to eat while walking around a mall and others that are just a no go. Oh, and did I mention it is an outdoor mall? I suspect the designers were from Southern California. The two other nearby kiosks feature snack foods (Wetzel's Pretzels and Sweetest Thing Cupcakes) and Sweetest Thing lets you come in from the cold while ordering and has one small table.\\n\\nI've eaten here twice and both times liked Joe's Cheeseburger just fine. It is in my golden zone as far as portion size (not too big) and is filled with veggies, including grilled onions (a personal favorite). The fries are highly disappointing. Absolutely bland and overcooked. I would chalk this up to an off batch, but it was the same for me on both visits. The only visible condiment outside is ketchup and you need to ask for to-go containers if you want to bring your meal home.\\n\\nThere is seating close by in a very fancy partially enclosed atrium with heat lamps.

One girl in particular is completely useless -- she gives me the same blank look of confusion every time I pay with the card, apparently never considering that she might take 2 seconds to learn how to do it for next time.  On top of that, she's got a bad attitude.  But even the cheerier employees are nonetheless inept (not all of them, but most).\\n\\nI love Pei Wei -- it's my go-to spot for a quick dinner.

A year or 2 passed and I went away to my first year of college in Rhode Island.  I came back home to do the usual laundry and get some home cooked meals but I was missing something.  Providence offered nothing special in the way of good Chinese and I felt there was a gap that needed to be filled.\\n\\nThen one trip home, my parents had mentioned there were some leftovers in the fridge from this new restaurant that had opened a few weeks ago.  So, expecting disappointment, I rummaged through the fridge and pulled out some hefty plastic containers.  Immediately, I knew there was something special in my hands as no Chinese restaurant had taken such precautions in packaging their leftovers.  I mean, these weren't the usual paper take-out boxes that fall apart after absorbing too much garlic sauce.\\n\\nSo my mom had recently decided to call it quits on deep fried foods...I know, I know, she's nuts.  But she's my mom so lay off.  Anyways, I crack open a container of Chicken and Garlic Sauce and add a serving of pineapple fried rice and nuke it for a minute.  *DING!* 'Ok',' I think to myself, 'At least this is a free meal\\"  I go for the rice first, the pineapple had started to sweat a little into the rice and was mixing with the garlic sauce.\\n\\nPOW!  It was magic!  I fell in love with the sweet and garlic flavors all melding together, the fresh taste of the fried rice, the very subtle but very pleasant spiciness of the sauce.  The chicken was still tender and the medley of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, celery and water chestnuts added a nice combo of crisp, crunch and meatiness.  In a frenzy, i devoured the plate and poked back into the fridge to see what else was in there.  To my surprise, there were chicken fingers (thanks to my old man and his undying love of fried foodstuffs), one of the major tests of a restaurant.  They were still tender, even after being in the fridge for a few hours, and were just right.  The batter was crisp and not too thick.  It wasn't trying to hide the chicken inside, it added substance to it.\\n\\nSo I've been back in numerous times since for both takeout and dine-in, trying everything from the General Gau's to the Crispy Beef, from the Double Cooked Pork to the Hot and Sour Soup and Salt & Pepper Shrimp; and I can say that nothing has yet to disappoint me.  The appetizers are fantastic, freshly fried and done just enough where they're not sopping in oil.  The fried rice is fried when you order it; you can taste it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp all afternoon.  The veggies are fresh and crisp and never taste like they've been frozen, and between you and me, the scallion pancakes may wind up on my list of my last meal.\\n\\nService inside or for pick up is always fast and courteous and there always seems to be seating available.\\n\\nThey also have another location in Downtown Walpole, which also serves sushi, which I will try soon!\\n\\nThe Wrap-up: The BEST moderately-priced suburban Chinese restaurant south of Boston.

We came here a little after 3 and had plenty of stools to choose from at the bar, but did notice that soon after we arrived, the bar quickly filled up.  \\n\\nThe burger was solid.  I don't really ask much for in a burger, as long as the beef is good.  So I do like that at Clyde Common the burger isn't fancy, like what I anticipated it to be at this kind of place.  The burger had the standard toppings of lettuce, tomato, pickle and mayo with a soft bun that sandwiched the beef.  It was tasty and exactly what we needed after day drinking.  I will say that the proportion to the bun and beef patty was off, as the bun was too large for the patty.  But the buns were soft, so didn't bother me as much as it would've been had it been a brioche bun or something with a more stiff texture.  Mayo was also too much on the burger, so had to wipe some off, to really just sink my teeth into the burger.  But overall, it wasn't bad.  Get the fries that are also on happy hour and share with a friend, as the portion was large!  Fries had a crispy texture and was perfectly salty.  I also did get a punch, which they literally serve from a punch bowl, and the recipe changes daily, so is worth asking the bartender for the day's concoction.  Mine was a bourbon base with lemon, so was more refreshing than alcohol-forward.\\n\\nClyde Common is definitely worth checking out for happy hour!  For something heavier, like for a meal, get the burger and fries.

So much so, that we made reservations for our last night because we wanted it to be our last meal before we left. This turned out to be a huge mistake as everything about Via Napoli has changed, and unfortunately so has the food. \\n\\nThey seem to have revamped the menu taking away a few of our old favorites, rebranding, and changing the recipes. We had the arancini, chicken alfredo, and the pepperoni pizza. The arancini was okay but definitely lacked some seasoning and had only the suggestion of a ragu in the middle. Their cream sauces for pasta are usually rich and tasty but their alfredo sauce tasted like what I can imagine comes out of a jar- flavorless and thin, nothing like I had remembered from their cream/carbonara pastas. My husband said his pizza (which arrived way after I had finished my pasta) was definitely 'different and disappointing' and not as good as he remembered. You could tell just by looking at the dishes that their quality has changed and they've succumbed to de-seasoning all of their food like the rest of Disney. \\n\\nThe only good part about our meal was our server, Giada, who had to deal with a lot of complaints similar to ours (which we didn't voice to the restaurant at the time of the meal).

They bake the rolls with a mound of scallop and mayo in top and their salmon sashimi with a ponzu sauce and mayo. When it bakes the mayo is gooey and easy to eat and although it is fattening it is so yummy (my friend thought it was cheese once)! Okay, so it might not sound all that appetizing when I explain it, but it is really quite something unique.

A few amazing employees, but a lot of them just don't care and they bring the whole place down.  Very slow, and when they recently messed up my order, they put the reorder at the back of the line.

At the bar was some rough and tumble locals then on one side you had an unattended (maybe the parents were in the other side) 12 year old co-Ed dance team. On the other were a few groups of adults just getting together for some late Saturday afternoon grub and conversation. Outside you had a wedding party plus guests between ceremony and reception at the Sheraton across the street.\\n\\nDecent beer selection at good prices. No ambers other than dos XX. But still, all draft/ bottled beer is $5 and cans are $4. Was served beer quickly.\\n\\nService was up and down because big groups come in (dozen people size groups). So my food despite being a simple Gyro, was not fast. Servers were nice and helpful when they were near where I was sitting. My gyro was awesome and for unhealthy bar food it seemed everyone in the place was enjoying theirs.\\n\\nOverall this place is very Austin-ish. It has the dark, hipster almost looking dirty visual.

Been there twice, but both times were a while ago. My distinct memories of the place were of a napkin that wasn't clean (and neither was the replacement that they gave me), and oily fingerprints on the knife I had. Alright guys, come on - if you can't even get your table setting hygiene in order how can I expect anything else after to be good?\\n\\nService was OK, drinks in particular took quite a while, but I suspect it was due to a lack of bartenders more than anything else. Speaking of the drinks, they had an interesting-looking absinthe-based drink menu that was basically just that - \\"interesting-looking\\". Four cocktails later, and every single one of them was horridly unbalanced. My friend and I agreed that it was more of a gimmick than anything else.\\n\\nThe table spacing of the tall tables further in are pretty bad. You can't get out of the inside seat without hitting the other table - even if you're turned 90 degrees and side-stepping. Last I checked, I was still a skin-and-bones Asian dude - I can't imagine anyone else getting out of there if they were bigger than me.\\n\\nOkay, let's talk food. The pizza was okay, but you can tell it wasn't a wood-fired pizza like many other places have started doing. The toppings stood out the most - there was a tad too much pecorino that killed the taste of the clam, though. The crab dish we ordered was far too rich - it was disgustingly oily and buttery. The aioli for it was good, but also equally rich. Hungry as we were, we couldn't bring ourselves to finish the latter dish without feeling like puking. I expected it to be a much lighter dish than it was.\\n\\nI really had much higher expectations for Waypoint, and unfortunately I won't be back here again. They did make an effort with presentation though - our receipt came in a \\"Survival at Sea\\" book, which was kinda cool, but also really random. I don't even know what to make of the music either - it went from deep house, to AT40 pop, to heavy rock and roll, to alt indie rock, in about a span of 1.5 hours.

They are not worth the money (2 for $8) because you don't get a lot of filling.  I like my bao overstuffed, thank you.  One slice of pork and one slice of apple just doesn't cut it.  Tori Kara Age was eh.  My wife and son had the Ginger Chicken Udon and Chicken & Shrimp Yaki Soba.  It did not look like soba to me and both looked like udon noodles.  Tasted OK though.

It's been a trend lately.\\n\\nShe made the reservation and paid the $50 fee to do so.\\n\\nRolled on in not knowing what to expect. I knew it would be Italian and that's all.\\n\\nFirst impression; elegant while still being minimalist. A cozy wine bar to the right as you walk through the oaken and glass double entry foyer. Next to the wine bar is a salumi slicing station. The proper Sommelier's presentation table is in the middle of the main dining room. There are two more private dining rooms off to the left and a partially open Chef's Table in the kitchen. White tablecloths, top-notch glassworks, tableware and a staff that is always scanning the room for the chance to be attentive, but not too much so are very hard not to notice. \\n\\nThe cuisine is described by our waiter as being Northern Italian. The restaurant is proud to focus on locally sourced ingredients and additional inspiration as well.\\n\\nOn this particular Saturday evening in January, there were two menus to choose from. One was an eight-course Truffle Tasting pre-fixe menu with an optional wine flight. Then other was a four-course Quatro Piatti menu from which we selected from a list of items for each course.\\n\\nWe started with a salumi plate and a small bowl of extremely delicious marinated olives.  The salumi presentation had sliced thin local black pepper salami, speck and imported prosciutto. Also on the plate were house-baked, buttery and crunchy pencil-thin breadsticks presented with mascarpone and horseradish creamy spread to cut the fat. The olives were a mix of green queens and smaller olives that could very well have been house cured as well.\\n\\nOur Antipasti Course consisted of Funghi MIsti and Capesante E Pere. The Funghi Misti was a selection of very delicate mushrooms cooked very gently in a butter and herb sauce and served with a soft boiled egg and shaved parmesan on top. Very earthy and satisfying. The Capesante E Pere involved slightly seared scallop, minced rutabega, poached pear chunks, and farro. It was dressed in a slightly vinegary kumquat and mustard sauce. After finishing off the Finghi Misti I remarked how I would eat a whole bowl full and be satisfied for the evening at that.\\n\\nOn this evening, there was also presented to us a complimentary chef's sampler plate consisting of mainly a series of Amuse-bouche one bite items. Of note from the offering; the arancini. Neat small little rice balls stuffed full of cheese, and caponata. There was a protein inside too which could have been ground pork, or maybe mild lamb, but I was not sure. I should have listened better when our server brought it to our table.\\n\\nOur Primi course was next up. For this course, we selected Rigatoncini and Gnocchi De Castagna. The Gnocchi was extremely delightful being very light, highlighted with a pork ragu, cream, and smoked ricotta garnished with crunchy chestnuts heighten the overall plate's texture. The Rigatoncini was however only briefly sampled as it came out way too al dente for my date's own taste. I sampled it as well and I have to say it was indeed crunchy with only the very outside of the pasta soft enough to even consider eating. Upon advising our waiter of our dislike in the dish, he promptly offered another plate from the course selection list. She also had the Gnocchi and was pleasantly happy in what she received.\\n\\nOur Secundi course consisted of the Sogliola and the Cervo E Castagna. Sogliola was grilled sole with green lentils and cabbage. She loved it. My Cervo E Castagna was a plate of roasted veal loin, sweetbreads with tiny venison cubes. It was a very rich plate, but since the portions are not large it was just enough to get the experience without the heaviness feeling afterward.\\n\\nFor our final Dolci course, we chose the Limoncello and the Torte Di Zenzero. The Limoncello was like a small snake of lemon and lime panna cotta surrounded by blood orange and mint. Extremely refreshing. The Torte was a very slightly sweetened spice cake aside one of the very best caramel sauces I have ever had with crumpled matcha and grapefruit segments along the top and side. That spice cake just by itself was so good.\\n\\nService, absolutely spot on. No complaints or even suggestions. They are well trained and equally experienced without being snobby. It's a good mix for this Boulder market.\\n\\nThe kitchen and chefs; they know what is right and how to present. Even with our misfired Prima course selected Rigatoncini they didn't bat an eye and delivered quickly. Kudos to those unsung heroes!\\n\\nWine selections, pretty darned good for the higher end offerings. I highly suggest utilizing the experience of their Sommelier and his experience with their list to get the best experience.\\n\\nAmbiance, elegant, yet very warm and comforting. even at our table next to the front window, it was as if you were fancy dining at someone's home in Northen Italy."},{"name":"DD Mau","address":"1239 Pacific Boulvard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I am a bit upset with the spring rolls having pork (unannounced on the menu) but their tofu bahn mi sandwiches are decent.

But you best order things to share because food comes out SUPER SLOWLY here! Between dishes, we had to wait sometimes as long as 30 minutes (and the place wasn't even that crowded for Sunday night - there were plenty of empty tables)! \\n\\nMost dishes were misses and letdowns. \\n\\nThe crab fries are so NOT worth it. It's a giant plate of fries with (supposed) miniscule crumbled amounts of crab, accompanied with an aioli sauce with the stingiest amounts of crab meat. Don't be deceived by the name!! Even if you love crab AND fries, just avoid the dish - it's just not worth it. \\n\\nTuna Crudo was just alright. The tuna itself lacked flavor and even the accompanying figs weren't sweet! The boldest part of the dish was the curried chickpea socca which had the texture of a super chewy crepe. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. \\n\\nThe Whitefish Pizza was super salty. It 10000000% reminded me of an Everything Bagel. The crust had a mixture of garlic, sesame seeds, salt, poppy seeds, etc. for a good amount of flavor. But the fish didn't really taste smoked and wasn't even that prevalent. What was super overpowering though was an OVERLOAD of capers. As much as I love capers, it really was a bit too much for me and I just felt overwhelmed by the saltiness of the dish. The slightly redeeming factor though was the cheeeeeeeese. A+ for super stretchy, gooey marscapone that creates a delicious and embarrassingly long trail of cheese with every bite. \\n\\nThe Blue Crab Salad was actually super tasty. Loveddddd the crunchy textures and the generous heaping of crab! It's less green, and more seafood than anything else. Def recommend!\\n\\nOverall, I think Waypoint's star ratings are way inflated. It was, at best, a mediocre meal."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Quick notes:\\n \\n- Reservations are highly recommended...and they go out quickly (if you go during peak vacation months). If you can't get a reservation, just keep checking everyday; I was able to get a lunch reservation for only 11:30am after intense stalking everyday on the site haha. If you are flexible with time, then there will be a higher chance to get a reservation.\\n \\n- If you can't get a reservation, and you can't wait for walk-ins, then on the side they sell single slice pizzas (not sure if its only select pizzas or if its for all of them). Only con is you will have to eat it outside...and that could be outside in rain, or a humid 90 degree day.\\n\\n- Its in a theme park...meaning theme park pricing. But since you won't be going here every single day, why not right? But when you think about it (Compared to other restaurants in Epcot), Via Napoli is a good bang for your buck considering the amount of food you get! So it can be affordable! And kid friendly...which kid doesn't like pizza!\\n\\n- They have complimentary bread and olive oil dip. You just need to ask for it.\\n\\n- I HIGHLY recommend the pizza here. \\n\\nReview:\\nWe were seated in their covered outdoors section, and it wasn't bad at all. I was quite apprehensive at first since it was blistering hot outside and they had the doors of the covered outdoors section open, but the many fans they had in the room kept us cool and content. The place was very clean, and noise level (minus the load crying baby) was pretty good as I was able to hear and converse with the fiance. \\n\\nWe got the arancini as our appetizer and it was delicious. Highly recommended. 3 moderately big risotto balls drenched in an ample amount of ragu sauce. Cover the balls with lots of that sauce then... mmm. If there is still sauce left, use the complimentary bread and soak that sauce in! \\n\\nThe fiance got the Candele pasta. To be honest, it tasted like OG quality pasta. Nothing really special about it. So stick with the pizzas at via napoli and get your pasta outside of the parks!\\n\\nI got the individual sized prosciutto e melone Pizza. Holy pizza! the individual size is huge (comparable to a medium sized pizza at pizza hut)! I was super full after half and more of the pizza and my fiance had to help me with the other half. The crust was perfect as it had enough doughy texture, and it was not super oily. Disney made a good effort in its part trying to reproduce pizza from Italy: Flour from naples, and water from a source similar to the water found in naples. Also the prosciutto (salty), cantaloupe (sweet) and arugula (bitter) complimented and balanced each other super well. I will definitely want this again and highly rec. the prosciutto e melone pizza. \\n\\nJust know that the pasta and pizza are made in separate kitchens so you will be getting the pasta first, before the pizza even arrives. I had to eat the pizza when my fiance finished his pasta dish. \\n\\nWe shared a strawberry acqua fresca and it was super refreshing on a hot day. It didn't taste artificial, had the perfect amount of sweetness, and sliced strawberries were in the drink. Highly recommended on a hot summers day!\\n\\nIn total, for the four items we paid over $70 (including tip) for two people T___T. So the bill can EASILY go up. However, this can be easily avoidable since two people can share an individual sized pizza, an appetizer/or salad, complimentary bread, and water for your drinks, that price can be halved and you will still be FULL. Or just get a Large Pizza by itself with no appetizers, and you will be full as the Large is HUGEE.

Nice interior design, spacious and calming to the mind. I am not a fan its location but it is manageable. \\n\\nI absolutely love the concept of the bakery -- you just comes in, grab a tray, layout the filter paper, grab a set of tong, choose your bread, and check out the the counter top. \\nThough that may be, I have an iffy feeling about how the bread are just in the \\"open\\" like that...it is not bagged, there is no plastic or glass cover...what if someone accidentally sneeze into it or random kids just start grabbing it. As a nursing student, the idea of hygiene always pop up in my head but I guess, when it comes to good foods, I will just ignore it. \\n\\nOne major complication that I faced during my visit is that there are way too many bread options! From plain, to sweet, to savory. Too many to choose from which makes my head hurt since I am a big indecisive person. If only I have the money to afford one of each and a tummy that can handle the heavy load. Definitely, I went over budget today but it was all worth it. \\n\\nMy brother and I bought the egg tart (super delicious with the semi-creme brulee sugar shell), kykyu cookies (too soft and sticky), honey Madeleine, fruit tart, castella cake (plain and unsweetened), red bean bun and custard bun (my brother's favorite), and Korean fried sugar coated donuts (tapioca, red bean, and original). Some were good and suitable to my taste bud and some where simple too plain and lack the sweetness kicks. \\n\\nI did not try any of the savory bread today but will definitely try it out during my next visit! \\n\\nIn addition, there is a limited specialty drinks available.

The daily line to wait for lunch or dinner can be up to four or five hours, and that is no way to spend your day at Disney World's Magic Kingdom.\\n\\nWhen you arrive for your meal, you are called to the front of Beast's castle where a host greets you and invites your party through the main gargoyle-decorated gate and front door. One lucky member of your party will be able to carry a candelabra (just like Lumiere) to light the way to the table. \\n\\nThe restaurant has three main dining rooms...the ballroom (the best of the three, which is where my family was seated for dinner), the West Wing (which is \\"forbidden\\" and holds the enchanted rose and a few of the Beast's personal things), and then another room that is more like a parlor (and the least exciting of the three). \\n\\nEvery half hour during dinner the Beast is announced and walks through the restaurant to thundering applause...he is the evening's host, after all. Guests can have their picture taken AFTER their meal with the Beast in his study. The pictures are priceless...do it! \\n\\nFor your dinner meal, I recommend the Grilled Strip Steak with Pommes Frites, though the Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops in the Puff Pastry that my mother ordered looked amazing! For dessert, a giant cart is rolled right to your table and you can choose from a variety of treats. Try the \\"Grey Stuff,\\" it's delicious! It's basically a brownie/cookie base with some fluffy cream on top. \\n\\nThis place is truly romantic and special. A young couple even got engaged while we were eating...it was pretty cute.

However, they came out completely charred black. Then I could barely get 2 bites of meat off of one rib. I showed our waiter. He agreed it was over cooked and offered me a new plate, but I chose to try the Confit Bahn Mi given the lack of meat on the ribs.

My fries with the Bahn Mi plate were rock hard. 2 other people with me had great fries so I could tell this was not normal. I could break them in half, and could barely bite down on them.

Still, this place is pretty nice and have variety of pastries."},{"name":"El Tacoriendo","address":"3892 Refugee Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Wow, I forgot to review this place! Their food truck is one of my favorite Mexican spots in town, so I had to head out to the brick and mortar to see if it holds up. It's way out on Refugee Rd so probably only a one time visit for me, since the food truck is five minutes from my job, but if you're out this way or live close to there, you need to check it out! \\n\\nJust like the food truck, you don't want to judge this book by it's cover. Right next to a dilapidated car wash, Tacoriendo is not much to look at. The building is run down and the inside is yellow painted cement, equipped with Mexican music videos playing constantly on the TV (A+ for Mexican music videos). We were told to sit anywhere, and our server was very nice. I think I actually recognized him from making deliveries to their truck over on Allegheny. \\n\\nThe menu here offers quite a few more options than the food truck, including a decent amount of fish options and combos. Honestly, I love the tacos and quesadillas so much that I wasn't interested in anything else and wanted to see how they compared. I went with two pastor tacos, two cecina tacos, and a cecina quesadilla. If you're unfamiliar with cecina, it's beef that they dry and salt like jerky, and Tacoriendo grills it after that. It's amazing.\\n\\nI also ordered some chips and guacamole, but I wasn't a fan of the guacamole. It was a bit too creamy for me and tasted like it came out of a bag. My buddy really liked it though.\\n\\nThe food was out quickly and everything tasted great as expected. My friend brought his girlfriend from out-of-town to the truck, and she really loved it, and they both liked this spot as well. My tacos and quesadilla were perfect and a little less greasy than the truck, since they didn't sit in a container for too long. But what really makes Tacoriendo for us is the hot sauce. The red sauce has a pretty big kick, and we just love the flavor. The green is pretty tasty as well, and you really can't go wrong with either one.\\n\\nIf you're looking for great authentic Mexican, then look no further than Tacoriendo. If you can't make it out to Refugee Road, then check out the food truck on Allegheny off Stelzer. The food is super cheap, so you can really try a little bit of everything, but you MUST try a quesadilla. I don't know what they do to it, but the amount and kind of cheese they put on it is awesome. End rambling. Go try it yourself."},{"name":"Pizza King","address":"","city":"Orlando","stars":"1","text":"I'm pretty sure they now go by the name of Two Italian Brothers Pizza Delivery.

For a party of 9, we shared a variety of dishes and spent about $53 per person after drinks, tax, and gratuity.\\n\\nWhat we liked:\\n- BREAD sampler with SQUID INK DIP and seaweed butter. This was truly unique and savory. Note: this was not free starter bread and yes, I will gladly pay $6 a plate.\\n- KING CRAB with brown butter and black rice (think: fried garlic) - so fragrant and delicious, and the chili oil was reminiscent of Asian dishes, yum! Oh, btw: it's $24 for literally two bites. Ouch.\\n- LAMB SHOULDER. Since it's cooked sous-vide, it was incredibly tender with perfect medium-rare doneness throughout. Unlike the king crab, this was massive, and so was the price $74.\\n\\nWe also ordered a whole branzino, two different pastas (uni bucatini and spelt gemelli), two different pizzas (chopped clam and Italian sausage), and the crab-flavored french fries. Waypoint must have hired Salt Bae to put the finishing touches on all of these dishes. We were so parched from the sodium overdose!! Other Yelpers seem to echo the same sentiment...\\n\\nThe menu did not offer much for greens to balance out the heavy meat/carb-filled dinner, only two choices: market veggie roast or pickled veggies. We went with the roast (half-size) and it was very under-cooked.\\n\\nI do want to point out that the service was a hit, hence the overall 3-star rating. Our server Alyson was great at handling a large party; she was attentive, answered all of our questions, brought out extra napkins and serving spoons (for large platters), and even offered a change of plates between courses.\\n\\nIf Waypoint can just fix the salt issue and add more greens to the menu, then we would definitely return for dinner."},{"name":"Hell Yeah Gluten Free","address":"900 Dekalb Ave NE, Ste 500","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been waiting on this place to open and it was well worth the wait.

Two sauces - one sweeter, one more on the savory side - were very good when consumed together in the same bite.\\n\\nI did try a bite of their samosa - potato and peas filled that sucker FULL - and it was also great. Again, nicely seasoned. There's no lunch buffet, but there is a lunch menu. I picked Chicken Tikka Masala. It was wonderful! A hint of spice in the back of my throat. Mixed with some of the basmati rice, and I was a happy camper.

Make your reservations as early as possible and try for dinner, if you can. Both breakfast and lunch are order and find a seat, whereas dinner is a full service option. Only guests with reservations are allowed on the bridge and into the restaurant to keep the crowds down, but it still took awhile to stand in line and order/find a seat. Each party is given a rose with GPS and food is delivered on carts- very clever! There are three different rooms so walk around and find you're favorite before you commit. Each person must get their own drink and silverware from the station and there's usually one employee working the area if you have questions. The food was great and we didn't have any complaints, but wished we had someone we could ask for small stuff such as sweetener and mustard that wasn't readily available.

Guess four stars at a Disney park and it's not just for the theme. Let me explain... Be our guest was a welcome addition to fantasyland at the Magic Kingdom located on Walt Disney World Florida resort property. For years and years and years actually as far back as I can remember you have not been able to get a quasi-acceptable meal at the park. Well, be our guest was the game changer for dining at the Magic Kingdom.\\n\\nBe our guest is now open for breakfast, and that's important to note because it is so incredibly difficult to get a reservation that they expanded hours to breakfast recently. Believe it or not this is indeed a quick service style restaurant however it requires reservations now.  The restaurant however does switch over to full service with quite the menu for dinner. As to be expected since this is bell and the beast castle the cuisine is French. What does that mean to you and I? Well for me that means a crouqe monsieur... That's French for a totally awesome hot ham and cheese. The menu for lunch, since that's the only meal that I've eaten there, is much more robust than one would expect. I've actually found the kids menu to be the least impressive when compared to the adult menu.  They have modified the menu slowly but Shirley and now offer a version of a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, a penne pasta however it is whole-wheat which doesn't bode well with all kids. \\n\\nSo here's how it all works. As you approach the castle, that is given did you have a reservation, the theme l as you would expect from Disney is amazing. I should note    bells castle is indeed there in forced perspective and while it is attractive divorce perspective does not work nearly as well as the castle add a hairy Potter at Universal. When you enter the restaurant or rather the hallway that leads to the person who allows you to order which day  \\n\\nThe ordering process was rather progressive and still is my most quickserve restaurants. When the inside has just reached you and asked for the number in your party you were given a heart Redheart that is a GPS locator, but more on that later. I am particularly fond of touchscreen cell service in ordering because I along with my kids like things a certain way, for instance I despise mayonnaise so that as you can imagine is a big problem always. OK see you ordered your food yeah it's a little pricey let's not even go into that you're at Disney what do you expect. When you depart the cashier and enter the main ballroom. It is absolutely breathtaking the ceilings must be 30 feet tall and are decorated plus chandeliers hanging and I'll be at a very very large dining room it does have a very lush feeling about it. Now what's really interesting is that during breakfast and lunch it's open seating so you can literally go anywhere you wantand grab a seat there. When your food is ready someone will come out with a glass covered card and they will locate you via GPS to deliver your piping hot food to you, it's actually pretty darn cool. There are two additional dining rooms, when you enter one is on the far left-hand side and that is the West Wing. It should be noted that many small children do not like this room whatsoever. As the painting is absolutely remarkable it is dark there are flashes of thunder and lightning, even though the magical room floating Rose is in there the room changes along with the beast photo with thrashed March through his face it's pretty intense for some kids with sensory issues. As you enter the main ballroom and head towards the right and you'll find the music box room. This is handsome with my kids favorite room because it is not oversized, but large enough to still fill you were in a castle. In the middle of the room is the rotunda with A music box adorned with the beast and Bell dancing which rotates continuously. The room is bright visually appealing and because it's a somewhat smaller size room there's not nearly the background noise for the rockers of people going in and out of the building; it's just more of an authentic feeling back there I guess.\\n\\nOK so the fancy hot ham and cheese sandwich which is amazing, so are the soups as he would anticipate the tomato bisque is fantastic and the French onion soup, while is out Regis Lee salty but one onion soup isn't outrageously salty? It is fantastic though. Even the french fries are different at be our guest then at most of the quickserve restaurants and any of the parts. They're thinner, obviously made with real potatoes, and kind of crispy think of it as kind a like steak and shake but thicker they don't get so hard or cold so fast. Of course dessert is quite the affair! As said in the movie try the gray stuff it's delicious don't believe us ask the dishes.

Where I'm from (SF Bay Area), this would not have been at all possible.\\n\\nWe called in advance to make sure they were taking patrons and waited about a minute to be seated. We ordered the beef rolls, XLB soup dumplings, Peaceful house noodles, ma po tofu, steamed pork buns, and a medium order of rice. For the 4 of us, this was actually more than enough. By the end of the meal, we had quite a bit of tofu and a few pork buns left. The beef rolls were great - crispy, savory, slightly sweet, and yummy! The soup dumplings were perfect, and the house noodles were surprisingly good. The rice was actually purple rice, which was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nDo note that they are CASH or (Canadian) DEBIT ONLY. We were hesitant to sit down at first when we found out this was the case. It wasn't until I put down my Bank of America card after our meal that we were told only Canadian debits were accepted. Luckily, there's a bank right next door.

Not by choice. Went in tonight with my boyfriend before midnight. Ended up staying over two hours. We were disappointed from the start, but it was made up for in the end. \\n\\nWe walked in around 11:45pm. Many tables empty but I understood and noticed about only four servers were working the floor. We were greeted by the host who didn't quite seem to know what was going on. He didn't know which tables he could seat and which he could not, nor which were clean or dirty. We waited about 7 minutes to be seated. \\n\\nWe sat next to a six-top party of loud Italian young people and six other people from different tables stood next to the table to talk to them. One kneeled on the booth that my boyfriend was sitting in and talked to them for about 5 minutes. They were rude and loud and annoying. (Though I know it was not the restaurant staffs fault. Just needed to rant, honestly.) \\n\\nThe restaurant was as cold as Antarctica. \\n\\nThe Presto tablet thing on the table did not work while the ones on all of the other tables worked. Ours was off completely and covered in something sticky. Gross. \\n\\nThe menus were drawn on by a child in crayon. \\n\\nAfter being sat, it took about 5 minutes to get greeted by a server. He did not introduce himself by name. My boyfriend ordered a kiwi iced tea, which was delicious and came a few minutes after. I ordered a kiwi limeade. I was given a water because I was waiting on the drink, which came 15 minutes after. \\n\\nWe ordered the 2 for 26. We asked for onion rings, the 4 cheese mac with honey pepper tenders and shrimp with fries. \\n\\nAfter about 45 minutes of waiting on food, our server says the kitchen had just told him they did not have onion rings, so we had to change them to boneless wings. \\n\\nWhile waiting for food, a server ran out an order of chicken tenders with fries. She had to stop at three tables before finding out which table it belonged to, which was not ours. Does your expo not show/tell which table to go to? They should not have to guess. \\n\\nAfter waiting for what felt like forever, we got our entrees, but not the boneless wings appetizer. \\n\\nThe 4 cheese mac with honey pepper tenders is something we both get a lot because we would rate it a 9/10, but the one we received was about a 3/10. The cheese sauce tasted nothing like any of the other ones we've tried, and the tenders did not have honey pepper sauce on it. Just regular chicken tenders. Hmm. \\n\\nThe shrimp was good though. Fries could've used seasoning. Tartar sauce and cocktail sauce was good too. Yay. Probably best part of the stay. \\n\\nWe finished the entrees. Never got the appetizer. We assumed they were going to just come after. The waiter apologized for them not coming out yet. \\n\\nI guess he expected somebody else to run it out, because we never got them and I guess he never checked to see if we got them. \\n\\nAfter a while more, we got our bill and I asked for the wings to be in a to go box. The waiter was very confused and asked if we really never got them. I wouldn't make this up. \\n\\nHe ended up comping the entire 2 for 26. This was a very nice thing for him to do. We only paid ~$6 for the drinks. But we still tipped more than 15% of what the entire bill would've been. \\n\\nThe waiter was stuck with a six top and a ten top before closing. We felt bad and understood his struggle. \\n\\nAlso, the bathroom was filthy and under stocked. No paper towels. \\n\\nFor a well-known restaurant, connected to a hotel, and one of the only ones open late, and in Orlando... It should have not been that understaffed. To only have only four servers on was crazy and made everything run severely slow. \\n\\nHopefully it's not this bad during the day, but I would suggest everyone to go somewhere else if you're looking for a late night bite."},{"name":"McAlister's Deli","address":"12226 Corporate Blvd, \\\\","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"McAlister's Deli popped up in the UCF area in the past year and it has been a welcome addition to my lunch options.

I've tried all except the sandwiches (shame on me).\\n\\nThe chain covers healthy options here with some great salads. I've enjoyed the grilled chicken, southwest cobb, and savannah chopped salad. Chicken is a little bland, but I love the toppings on the salads. Savannah has more of a sweet side to it with cranberries and honey roasted almonds. I've discovered that the full salads are huge (for me at least), so I like to go with a half portion. \\n\\nSoups and spuds are pretty good too. Chicken tortilla soup has a creamy texture, served with a few tortilla chips on the side. Chili is served Texas style with no beans. In terms of the spuds, the grilled chicken spud is just okay. I'm a huge potato fan, so my expectations here my have been a little high for the potatoes. The cheese and chicken were in one mass and felt like it may have been sitting a while. At least it is a good size - the half spuds are really one potato and the full spuds are two potatoes.\\n\\nThe restaurant is clean and inviting. Staff wander around to refill drinks. I've noticed that its proximity to UCF and Siemens make it a go-to spot for working professionals. Be sure to check out the \\"pick two\\" option and grab a cookie.

I'm knocking down stars for service though. The service didn't seem to match up to the type of restaurant this was. Usually at upscale restaurants I expect exceptional service as well. I had finally gotten my a sick baby down to sleep by 9:30 pm at night and wanted to meet my rents here after they just flew into town. I was looking forward to a relaxing dinner but was put off by the waiters inattentive demeanor from the very first moment. Let's just say tude from the waiter is not what I needed!  When he arrived at our table, he didn't ask if we had any questions about the menu, he was just like are you ready to order? Usually waiters at these types of restaurants take so much time to describe each item. I started off with a salad. I actually didn't like the salad so when he asked me what I thought I said it was okay. And he acted all offended! He was just like oh, okay. And that's it! Not once did he come back after to see if we enjoyed our dinner at least. I was in a bit of a hurry to get back to my sick baby, and he was completely Mia. I told him I would appreciate it if they  could try their best to rush my order , but he was like ummm. I was like no worries I can get it to go if it takes too long. But I was still eating my burger when he came to ask if we wanted dessert and he was like I thought U were in a hurry but I see ur still eating  your burger. Seriously???? When my Rents had a question about the menu he gave one word responses. So tempted to name drop him , but I'll hold back! Soo put off and I will not return nor recommend this restaurant.

It's the place I go to when I've had a bad day and need to unwind, the place I go to when I want to hang out with my lady or a few friends, and the place I go to when it's time to celebrate a special occasion. I absolutely love it.\\n\\nFirst order of business: the drinks, of course! Their drink menu is stellar: creative drinks mixed in with the old standbys, and new ones are developed pretty frequently. I haven't had a drink here that I didn't like. The Manhattan is indeed badass, and the Bee Sting is a perfect blend of peppery spice and honey sweetness. Even their dessert drinks are awesome. On my last visit, I tried the Fino Dessert Cocktail, and it was the perfect choice for those who prefer to drink, rather than eat, their desserts.\\n\\nTheir tapas and small plates are also highly recommended. One of the things I love about Fino is that you can order small plates in rounds. The plates are great for sharing, and I've really enjoyed almost every one I've sampled. The fried goat cheese with onion jam and honey is my favorite, because c'mon, who doesn't like fried cheese? The added sweetness from the onion jam and the honey elevates these little bites to a whole new level of greatness. The lamb picadillo stuffed piquillo peppers are also worth sampling: spicy ground lamb encased in a smoky, blistery pepper. Mmm! I've been for brunch, too, and I still remember that eggs hollandaise as one of the best I've had. It. was. incredible.\\n\\nIt's not just the food, though: the service is attentive without being annoying. I don't love it when servers are constantly swarming around my table and making a fuss, but I also hate when I feel neglected and have to wait several minutes to get my server's attention. The servers at Fino strike the right balance between these two, and I always appreciate that. \\n\\nI should mention that this place isn't for those who feel spending over $10 on a meal is absurd. It's a little pricey, but I don't mind giving my dollars away here because it's absolutely worth it, every time."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Yay!

Both meals came out in literally 5 mins! Way beyond prompt. A bit concerning as I think of it.... Was it fresh? The vermicelli was decent. A good mixture of vegetables and meat. The pork really didn't satisfy me as it lacked flavor. The egg roll was not fresh, it was barely warmed nor crunchy.. I did sample my beau's Pho. He asked for a yellow noodle swap which made the pho tastier. I however was dissatisfied with the temperature of the broth. It was lukewarm. I should've realized this the moment the server brought it to the table and it was not steaming, like it should have been..\\n\\nWith all that said, I honestly would reconsider returning.

Best way to use a quick service credit on your dining plan, as  the full meal is worth $21. During the day, unless you decide to pre-order your meal ahead of time, expect to walk through a corridor lined with armor, and into the Beast's library, where you will select your hot hors d'ouerves or soup du jour! The breakfast comes with a full plate of pastries, one drink, and your meal. I love the poached eggs atop a baguette, with arugula, tomato and brie. For lunch, you get a drink, entree (think steak sandwich or quiche) and a dessert (they have the Grey Stuff cupcake!!) Then, put the Be Our Guest Restaurant's service to the test! After you order, you will place a magical rose upon your table, and your server will find you in one of the many massive dining rooms, and bring you your food!\\n\\nThe dinner experience is quite special, including menu offerings like filet and the grey stuff, and details like your dinner napkin being folded into a rose. \\n\\nMy dining room of choice is the ballroom, with soft snow falling outside the windows.

There was no one there.  Why so?  They had run out of donuts.  I was told that a batch would be delivered in anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour from then.  All I can surmise is that there's an offsite location where they do the baking.  This provided an opportunity to look at some of the cliche' sights in the hood.  In returning about 45 minutes later, there were customers in the store.\\n\\nI had identified the donut I wanted.  It was the chocolate almond ganache donut.  It cost $3.25.

So, for handing me a $3.25 donut and not even smiling or saying \\"thank you,\\" not to mention having to return in 45 minutes, you have a tip line on the receipt?  I don't think so.

It became a challenge because our wrap keeps curling up and become sticky, to the point where it's not usable anymore.

She then asked us how hot was the water when it was brought to us, and we said hot enough to see steam come out.  She then explained that the other waitress has brought us water that is too hot for the purpose. This is why the wraps curled up too quickly.  So all this was fine and a lesson learned by both side.

He is originally from Steubenville, OH where this place started out at. I checked out the pics and I was not impressed, if anything I was more concerned by the pics. Me and my other employees joked about how the pizza looked identical to school cafeteria pizza. In most pics the pizza did not appear to be done, and considering I usually request my pizzas to be baked well done, I was not sold on trying this place immediately. I happened to be in the area yesterday so I figured I would try them. The inside was pretty cool they had 3 arcade machines (2 in working order) and a various assortment of uncommon sodas. I ordered two slices played some old school Mortal Kombat while I waited. One of the other Yelpers advised that you should let the pizza sit in the box for several minutes so that the cheese can start to melt.\\n\\nThe GOOD: The pizza crust is amazing. The Mortal Kombat was free to play! The customer service was good as well.\\n\\nThe BAD: Even after driving around for about 8 minutes the cheese did not really melt. The pizza did not look appetizing at all to me.\\n\\nThe UGLY: The pizza to me is a small step above those Lunchables pizzas you can but at the grocery store. I left my wife a slice and she did not like it either. The crust is the only thing that helped me power through my slice.\\n\\nI think this place has potential because of the amazing crust. I even feel like if they would cook the pizza the traditional way it would improve my rating. I probably won't try them again, because if I am in the mood for a Lunchable pizza, I'll save a few coins and purchase one from Walmart.\\n\\nPepperoni Slice (1-5=1.8)."},{"name":"Tony Starlight Showroom","address":"1125 SE Madison","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"An incredible failure of a Christmas show.

My husband ordered the rib dinner with baked beans and Mac n cheese. My son ordered the brisket sandwich with fries. Initially we couldn't decide between the ribs and quarter chicken so the owner says he will throw it in for free! Although it feels like we paid for it because our total was still $35 for 3 meals.

The meats were heated but the baked beans, greens, and Mac n cheese were all COLD!! This is troubling because food has to be stored for some time to reach the temperature that is this cold. So cold that after I heated up the Mac and cheese it was a puddle of juice/water underneath. Smh. And it's even more sad that the owner didn't even mention that he didn't heat our food up. I mean a few mins in the microwave and we might not have been the wiser. \\nAnyway, I heat the food up to discover tough greens and SOMETHING wrong with the Mac n cheese.

We were thoroughly pleased.  While it does not offer the 40+ selections of Jacksonville's Fifth Element what was there was all exceptional.  \\n\\nI started with the dal.  Like the other selections it was spiced to a medium level.  Scoville lovers may wish to ask for some additional heat.  The masala was perfectly balanced however.  Nothing over powered another yet the flavors of all were evident.  It was an excellent start.  My guest wholeheartedly agreed.  \\n\\nThe tandoori was quite good.  Lately I have been presented with some that was rather dry.  Not this.  It was moist and flavorful and had that beautiful red clay color that is such a delight to the eye.  The tiki masala was also a winner.  My guest does not eat poultry but loved the sauce over her rice.  I would have just like a tad more heat.  This medium spiciness was probably best for most though.  I was less pleased with the biryani.  It seemed to be missing the magic.  \\n\\nThe condiments were as expected.  The proper chutneys and curries were pleasant and well done.  My guest is not usually a fan of Indian pickles but she raved over the mango.  It had an intriguing tartness and sweetness that was a welcome addition to the plate.  It did not have the hot peppers that usually populate this dish and in this case I was glad that it did not.  Served as a nice foil.    The hot fresh nan delivered to our table was a joy.\\n\\nAll of the rices and vegetarian dishes were tasty but one really stood out.  They were mixed potato and vegetable croquettes that resembled Vienna sausages in size.  I wish that I had remembered their name.  The spicing was similarly complex yet balanced as was the case with the dal.  Embarrassingly I returned for more three times.  \\n\\nWe finished with the golab jamun.  The nicely sized balls of sweet dough swimming in a sweet and fragrant syrup were slightly different than others I have had anywhere.  They were better.  The flavor of the sugar, saffron, and cardamon in the syrup seemed to be infused in the batter itself.  My guest was in Indian culinary heaven. \\n\\nI just could not end it there though.  While my guess enjoyed her third golab jamun I returned to the buffet one last time for just a small bowl of dal and another couple of those phenomenal croquettes.  \\n\\nThroughout our time there we were made to feel like visiting family.

It's Italian. It would be great spot for a date, or for a wine night with the girls.  I got there a little early and I got to observe the flow of the family.. how The hostesses are the servers and the bartenders and sometimes help in the kitchen. It's a true family restaurant. I love how the kitchen is open... it is literally an open floor plan. It makes you feel like you are watching your crazy Italian uncles cooking. It's very welcoming and very unique for Boston. \\n\\nThe menu is classic Italian. Everything was delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. I ordered The fettuccine Alfredo  and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It was fresh, it was creamy (but not too much) and the portion was huge. It was enough for me to have for another few meals. Again the price was extremely fair and I knew that it was going directly into the family. \\n\\n I would highly recommend this if you're in the area looking for Italian, want affordable prices, and a welcoming, family type environment.

Talk about sales help that are NO HELP - I am use to shopping at their store on Barbur Blvd, which is not ultra modern, upscale or as tony as the Pearl District location.  BUT, the help is better and item selection seems greater.  The first time I shopped in the Pearl store it was okay.  I was looking for a specific white wine and no one could help me locate or particularly seem to give a shit, but I wrote it off to the location hence the sales help attitude.  It's not like I was looking for $100 bottle of wine, so I figured the sale didn't matter to them.  The second time I was there was during lunch hour and I ordered a falafel from the deli.  As I stood there waiting, I saw other customers getting their sandwiches before me although they ordered after me. And as I was watching the sandwich ordering process, I noticed it was not practical or service orientated towards the customer.  There are bunch of people to take your order but then they give all the sandwich orders to one person to make, the order takers just stand around with attitude.  When I asked the person who took my order how much longer it would be, she could not locate the order, and told me another 10 minutes or I could leave.  Real great customer service.  Her one job was to the place the order and she could not do that, didn't apologize or take any responsibility.  I eventually received my falafel and it was horrible.  Plus, missing ingredients.  When I was checking out they asked \\"did you find everything okay\\" and I proceeded to tell them about what happened at the deli counter and they just stared at me.  Because THEY DON'T CARE.  So, today I thought okay one last time - third time is the charm.  NO NO NO.  I wanted a tuna sandwich.  They have tuna in containers but no tuna sandwiches.  So, I asked the deli person to make me tuna sandwich and she said we can't.  Although, we have bread and tuna we can only make you the sandwiches on the board and then she suggested I have a some sort of bowl.  WTF.  I left in disgust and will never return.

I came with three other people, even though we literally went to Fogo a couple days ago. At first, I was hesitant to come just because we came on an off-day, like Wednesday, instead of a weekend, and you know how restaurants typically are...\\n\\nFirst off, the manager and his wife are super nice and helpful. They put in our Groupon (Groupon with an extra 20% off promo code - ended up being around $40/person including gratuity and tax so it is definitely worth getting instead of paying regular price since it's basically free bottles of wine plus it's overall cheaper if you do catch a Groupon sale... I did a lot of calculating). \\n\\nThey gave us the circular cards for the waiters/carvers to know if we wanted meats or not -  typical Brazilian Steakhouse stuff. But omg, their meats were amazing! \\nI was surprised how good their meats were for the price we paid. Compared to Fogo, I usually stick to Red and Green because they are consistent. With Fogo, it has been hit or miss. Sometimes Fogo was amazing, but sometimes it just wasn't flavorful. Red and Green's meat selections included filet mignon, garlic steak, ribs, rib eye, a house special, lamb, chicken wrapped in bacon,  and chicken hearts.¬†Yum!  Their salad bar was okay - wasn't anything special. Typical salads, Caesars, spinach, mixed greens, pasta salads, etc. But it was good enough for me.\\n\\nThe servers were super nice and circle around really fast. If they give you a meat that is overcooked or undercooked to your liking, just tell them and they will cook it more or give you a different piece. Just make sure to voice your concern, they are super easy going. \\n\\nOnly con is that there isn't a hot bar that Fogo has (fogo has a hot bar with mashed potatoes, rice, etc.) Red and Green had soup, though, but I didn't get any. But we went to a Brazilian restaurant for the meats, not for the bar foods! Overall, the price and quality of meats at Red and Green is worth the price you pay. I would highly recommend.\\n\\nP. S. Their garlic bread and cheesy bread were sooo good!"},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Jiko...the second and fancier restaurant at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. It's considered a signature restaurant, we'll get to that, and it was fairly hard to get reservations early in the evening. We ended up getting them for about 8:15, which was alright as there were less people inside. The restaurant is nice, a bit to dim for my preference but the place smelled good. \\n\\nBeing a signature restaurant they have a \\"dress code\\". Here's what's irritating about that. It states business casual, no tank tops, flip flops, or swim suit stuff. So that's what we did. They don't adhere to it as much as I though. Others had on Disney t-shirts/tank tops, sandals(not flip flops, but gladiator style and the strappy sandals), and plain t-shirts. So don't worry if you forget, they mainly don't want people showing up fresh from the pool or with wet swim clothes on. I guess they've had people come dressed like that and the water and chlorine ruins the leather and fabric seat covers. They have a bar area where you can watch appetizers and a few other small dishes being made but these are first come first serve, and seating near the windows were you can watch the animals out and about earlier in the day. It's a nice place, definitely not that kid friendly though. Our waiter was a-ok, he wasn't attentive but he wasn't not attentive either, if that makes sense. He wasn't really helpful when it came to what he could recommend off of the menu, not sure why but maybe he was new or wasn't a fan of anything? Although I know they're usually required to still recommend something at least. Eh, it kind of put me off a bit though.\\n\\nWe ordered the bread and charcuterie board for an appetizer, and that was super good.  I really liked the blueberry sauce with the the soft african cheese they paired it with. The other two were hard cheeses served with nuts/seeds and the other with a honey comb piece. The platter had 2 types of sausage meats, pickles and something similar to a tortilla chip only a little bigger, and they only gave us 4 pieces? That was odd considering there was so much on the board. He chose the Mrouzia-style Moroccan Lamb Tagine with parsnip silk, root spinach, medjool date smoor & pomegranate glaze. The lamb was super tender and literally fell off the bone(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jiko-the-cooking-place-orlando-4?select_video=gzO6izOVtDH7S8pd1pXRoA). I decided on the Snake River Wagyu strip loin because it had pasta and grilled asparagus. I was fairly disappointed with this plate. While the steak was delicious and cooked to perfection, they only give you 3 chunks. The asparagus was good, but could have been seasoned a touch more and the pasta was so-so nothing special but a bit spicy. I wouldn't order it again, and I am glad that Jiko includes the upper level DDP because I would not have been happy to pay $49 for that meal. For $49 you can also get the Filet Mignon but i believe it was smaller in ounces.. we didn't get dessert because nothing jumped out at me from the menu and I didn't ask for a recommendation either because of the entree issue. When the waiter brought our check, he included two flourless chocolate crinkle type cookies coated in powdered sugar. They were alright but a bit dry. Not an overwhelming experience for this dinner.\\n\\nIf you really want a \\"fancy\\" dinner, aka small portions with hefty price tags, you'll want to head to Jiko. Maybe one of their other entrees would have been more satisfying but i was underwhelmed with the portion size of the steak for sure, even though it was tasty. The lack of service from the waiter was annoying, especially when we needed drink refills, and not being able to truly recommend anything off of the menu for first time diners. It's a nice restaurant, well suited for adults looking for a dinner with less children present than other locations, and still just 1 dining credit/pp. Although I suppose that Jiko is a nice break from the usual theme park food.

Regrettably I did not ask where the review came from, which is a mistake I shall endeavor never to make again because this place was BA-bad, not just ba-bad, not bad.  In all actuality I really have been more disappointed at varying eateries but on this occasion there were three fundamental culinary areas that made this experience for me worse than the second Cylon war.\\n\\nTo begin Menu, not confusing not hard to read but tricky.  At the top there are listed three burgers by size with an accompanying price.  As you move down you will read names of other burgers. Now pause a sec.  Each burger listed below has an accompanying price as well, but here is the tricky part some of them have pulse signs before them. Since price is going to be my next subject we will stick with menu.  As you continue to read the menu begins to evolve from a burger joint to Buca di Faggoncini.  The italian options are laughable and there is a weak wine selection to boot.\\n\\nPrice. After going over the tricky part of the pricing here is how it rolled out.  for an eight ounce burger with Grilled onions and Guacamole and cheese I spent nearly $15.  My friend got a salad from the menu and when it came out it looked like the waiter had dumped it out of the bag right into the bowl on his way out.  Not so much worried about presentation but come on bag salad that cost you $7 really?  My other friend ordered chicken strips.  Dull at best.

What makes it unique is that the cheese and toppings go on after the pizza is cooked, so the cheese kind of melts while you eat it.  You'll also love Dicarlo's if you're into a crispy, crunchedy crust.  The unmelted cheese and that crunchy crust really make for an interesting and different 'Za experience.  \\n\\nI ordered 4 slices of their pizza.  Even if you just order a slice, they still heat it up for you and put the cheese on last, so you aren't missing out on the full DiCarlo's experience.  4 slices came out to be $4.40, which isn't too bad for lunch.  The green peppers were just okay, but I thought the plain cheese was better.\\n\\nThere's no place to really sit inside (besides a bench, which is more for waiting rather than eating).

Yes, there are 2 different menus here, one for Chinese folk and one for all others.  There's no egg foo young, or cream cheese wontons, or General Tso's on ours, so don't bother if that's what you think is Chinese food.  That American food has its place, somewhere.

I agree with the other reviewers regarding the service. When ordering, I always feel as if I'm inconveniencing the staff, as demonstrated by their eyerolls, mumbling, and their general lack of enthusiasm. A lone server had to yell at four servers sitting down eating salads in the dining area three times to get up and help him. \\n\\nThe ratio of employees chopping and prepping in the back to line servers is greatly skewed, which hurts the efficiency of the line movement. I find a lot of times I have to guide my food server through the preparation of my salad/bowl more than should be necessary, and they are not familiar with ingredients or how the ingredients should be dispersed (Ex, I had an employee add as much cilantro to my base as if it were a leafy green base, not a topping. They did not know what beets were on another visit). Some will LOAD my salad with way too much chicken or way too many premium ingredients (which is generally appreciated but causes the salads to be hard to eat or disproportioned). I wouldn't be shocked if sweetgreen was losing money off of improperly measured ingredients. This also changes the caloric content advertised. \\n\\nSome of the employees here are very quick, efficient, enthusiastic and kind, but as a whole, I think they could benefit from better staff training or an overhaul. Also, for a new(ish) location, they should be MUCH cleaner. \\n\\nThis location is a HUGE contrast to the speedy, enthusiastic, and cleaner location at Market Street in Lynnfield.

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!\\"\\n\\nReview #200! Of course it would need to be something special to me. Beauty and the Beast is quite literally my all time favorite Disney movie and our trip was booked around the dates I could get reservations here in August haha. This was the top of the list for our trip and my absolute \\"must do\\" while we were there. I managed to snag a lunch and dinner reservation online because i really wanted to experience both as they're both different. Lunch is a quick service meal, dinner is a table service meal. Either way, highly suggestion reservations for either meal time because yes they get stupid busy. I can truly see the appeal that this restaurant has, because to even see the inside of it, you have to dine there. When walking through Fantasyland, you'll see a castle atop a mountain behind a tall, wrought iron gate and bridge. You'll see plenty waiting outside for their reservation times, and if you don't have one, you can attempt to get a reservation at 4:30pm when the booth out front opens up for dinner as people tend to cancel last minute so you could get lucky. We did end up doing that once and got in at 5:00pm in the coveted ballroom, so it can happen. \\n\\nLunch at Be Our Guest is fairly easy. You walk through the main room once you're called and the front doors to the castle open and a server comes out to get you. You're given a menu to look at while you stand in line, place your order and scan your magic band to deduct from your dining plan, which covers meal and non-alcoholic drinks for lunch. The souvenir cups are extra, a light up goblet, the enchanted rose tumbler and a Lumiere cup. I ended up ordering the Croque Monsieur(grilled sandwich with carved ham and Gruyere cheese and Bechamel w/ Pommes Frites) while the boyfriend opted for the Braised Pork Coq Au Vin style(slow cooked pork w/ vegetables & bacon with mashed potatoes & green bean jadini√®re). Lunch is self-seated & that's kind of a problem because they can't really keep track of how many people are inside...we wandered around for about 10 minutes across al; 3 dining areas before finding a table near the windows in the ballroom, so we watched enchanted snowfall while waiting. The food was delivered via a cart that was brought around by servers. IDK how they knew where people since it was self seating but whatever & took about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. The sandwich was alright, the Gruyere was too rich, i think it would've been better with Gouda or Brie, but the BF enjoyed his pork so i guess it was a half win for lunch haha. \\n\\nDinner is another experience. You're escorted in and to your table by a host/ess. For dinner you don't have the choice of where you sit so it could be the ballroom, the Beast's Den or the Rose Gallery room. For both the reserved dinner & our walk up dinner we were seated in the Ballroom, and man is it beautiful. The lighting is dimmed for dinner making it very romantic and the servers are very attentive. We ordered the assorted cheese boards, which came with a loaf of french baguette, 4 french cheeses and several accompaniments for our appetizer both times, and because I enjoy a good steak, i had the grilled strip steak twice. The garlic herb butter they serve with it & the spices that encrust the meat with such a pretty sear..it was delicious, melt in your mouth amazing and cooked perfectly, not over or under! It also came with seasonal veggies & pommes frites. He ordered the saut√©ed shrimp & scallops; lobster, mushrooms & seasonal veggies in a lobster sauce atop housemade noodles. The second night he had the roasted lamb; w/ spaghetti squash, roasted beets, charred baby veggies, red pepper coulis, beet pur√©e and red wine gastrique. Dessert wise we went with The Grey Stuff(chocolate shell w/ cookie cr√©me topped w/ Lumiere's special \\"grey stuff\\") & the Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake(vanilla sponge cake, strawberry mousse filling & cream cheese icing), both were super tasty and the Grey Stuff is extremely rich; we ended up taking one to go! 5 stars for the dinner portion of BoG.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here takes you to the castle. You dine in the iconic ballroom which the Beast & Belle danced, you can see the Master's den and the Enchanted Rose bell jar(the rose wilts every 7 minutes with a lightening display), and the Rose Gallery is a dining room full of photos of the Beast and Belle partaking in various activities such as reading, traveling, playing with Chip etc, with a giant music box-esque platform in the middle of room hosting the happy couple dancing. There is a separate room where you line up to take photos with the Beast before walking down a row of armored knights that whisper as you go by. At the exit is the famed stained glass portrait of Belle & Prince Adam from the end of the movie.

With menu items averaging $12 - $18, this can be a pricey meal. That would be okay if the food was amazing. Unfortunately, the food was just average. There is also a 3% health and wellness charge to pay for employee's health insurance since the business does not provide this for their employees.

Overall, everything was fresh and clear to us that a lot of attention to detail/love went into the dishes. \\n\\nThe Uni Soba was simple but delicious. The uni and roe were super fresh and seafood-y sweet in ways that can't be beat! I was a little unimpressed by the soba itself though. I'm used to darker soba, with more flecks of buckwheat in appearance and taste. This soba here felt a bit more processed and also - somehow all the noodles pieces were cut / already shortened. I really love my noodles and sometimes the best part is just the satisfying length and accomplishment you get when you slurp it all up! A feeling that was sorely missed because all the noodles were about 2-3 inches long. \\n\\nThe Lobster Okonomiyaki is appetizer-sized and comes in 4 pieces. The okonomiyaki part itself was pretty standard, but it's topped with a good amount of fresh, cold lobster (similar to the temperature and texture you would see in a lobster roll). \\n\\nTorch Tuna Roll was pretty standard but I give it props for combining some of my favorite ingredients and ensuring a really fresh, beautifully plated roll!\\n\\nThe Matcha Mont Blanc was a disappointment. The menu said it comes with ice cream - it's a lie!! It does not! The cake itself was more cream than cake. There's a small layer of cake, topped with a whopping amount of cream, and some red bean - all before it's lathered in matcha frosting. One of my favorite things about matcha desserts is the fine balance between sweetness and bitterness, but the Matcha Mont Blanc was wayyyyyy too sweet.

In my short drive I saw Mexican , Dominican  , Venezuelan  , Cuban  and Colombian  restaurants lining my route. \\nI immediately paused and scanned my Yelp for lunch so\\nI could patronize one of the small businesses in the area. \\n\\nThis cute spot is in the food court of the Plaza del Sol Latin American Mall. When you walk in the main entrance of the mall itself you're immediately hit with tons of Latino shops selling everything from fajas to vestidos  formales. It has an awesome vibe. \\n\\nJust around the corner is the food court. Arepazoo Is in the back right corner of the food court. Being that I had already looked them up on Yelp, I I already knew what I wanted. The Patacones con carne . I also ordered Kola Champagne (one of my faves). My total with tax, was only $8.05.\\n\\nAfter waiting about five to seven minutes, I received a buzz on my pager telling me that the food was ready. When I walked up, I found perfectly cooked patacones enveloping a serious sandwich. Yum \\n\\nAfter I took my Yelp-requisite picture (you're welcome ) I dug in. Before I spill the tea let's rewind. I love Patacones. They are my absolute favorite side. I love them so much, I can make a meal out of them. My Grandma  and my friend's mom are tied for the best Patacones ever in my book. I am a patacones oficiando. I know good ones and I know bad ones. It may seem like a straightforward dish but in reality, it is one not easily mastered. \\n\\nNow for the tea  this sandwich was effin' AMAZING. Patacones that were crispy and well seasoned and the perfect thickness cooked in nice clean oil. The carne was amazing, cooked ropa vieja style and seasoned to the nines. It was tender and juicy. The carne was topped with lettuce, tomato , queso fresco and two house-made salsas (roja y verde) both mayo-based. When I tell you I devoured this sandwich, I mean it. Best of all, this $8 gem of a meal had me stuffed full.  When I finished, I had to take a break because I immediately felt a post-meal nap trying to take me down right at the food court table. After a brisk walk through the mall, I was back on my way. \\n\\nAbsolutely loved this place. It ranks high on the best things I've ever eaten. I'll be back."},{"name":"Barley's Brewing Company","address":"467 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Bang for your buck: 10/10\\nQuality: 9/10\\nService: 9/10\\nAmbiance/Location: 10/10\\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\\n\\nWe love Barley's!

The decor is nice, but it was a little humid inside the last time I was there. \\n\\nI've gotten several items at this location, and I wouldn't recommend the curry for someone who LOVES curry like me. You know those foods that you just can't stop comparing to another? That's red curry for me. I just end up pining for another one. It's a fine example of red curry, just not the best.\\n\\nWhat does stick out here is the fried rice. The pineapple fried rice is really great! Maybe the best I've had. \\n\\nOverall, I prefer several other Thai restaurants in Austin, but none of them reside in the downtown area. If you are meeting up or needing lunch, you'll enjoy it. But if you are craving Thai and have the means to drive elsewhere, I'd go that route :)"},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Mmmm...my tummy is rumbling just thinking about Boma. This is the other restaurant in the Animal Kingdom Lodge. It's downstairs, to the left of the stairway with Jiko to the right. Also note that the bathrooms are located behind the staircases once you get down stairs and they're used for both restaurants. I enjoyed Boma far more than I did Jiko, and I'd love to try their breakfast buffet next time. \\n\\nWalking into Boma, we were seated within about 10 minutes of our reservation and they were BUSY! In a buffet style eatery that's a good thing as the food is more likely to be fresher due to the constant flow of patrons. We were seated about 10 feet from the buffet line and the food smelled mouth-watering. We grabbed plates and loaded up. The dinner buffet has around 75 different African offerings ranging from chicken, curried lamb stew, watermelon/tomato soup, Ghanian oxtail stew, seafood gumbo, breads, desserts etc, it was pretty impressive. I tried the spice crusted strip loin, potatoes, tomato stew type paste sauce, a variety of breads while he tried the seafood gumbo, Durban style roast chicken, strip lion, spiced sweet potato mash, and then a few of the soups as well. If you're interested in wine and beers they've got a full selection African & craft beers, full service bar and a wine list with exclusive South African wines. Everything we tried was amazing! Nothing was over cooked or dry, while it was all spiced and seasoned perfectly without kicking you in the teeth if you've got a sensitive palette. We both went back several times, trying a few different things on each turn. The steak and seafood gumbo were favorites for both of us, and of course i loved all of the bread options. Try as much as you can honestly, even if it means taking smaller portions of everything haha.\\n\\nThe service was superb. What I really love about Disney is that they try to be as authentic as possible. Everyone who worked at Boma was from some part of Africa and they had nothing but smiles. Our server was hella attentive even though it was a buffet. He checked in several times, making recommendations on what we should try next while grabbing our drinks for refills. The overall experience was extremely pleasant and fun to try the flavors of Africa. I would recommend this place to get more bang for your buck instead of hitting Jiko. You get the full feel with the outdoor evening dining(even though you're in doors), the set up is on par with the natural space setting and its just really fun. Put Boma on your dining to-do list y'all, because its quite the experience. Oh, and if you get breakfast or early dinner reservations with seating by the window, you might catch a few glimpses of the animals! If you're not staying at Animal Kingdom Lodge, try to arrive maybe 30 minutes before your reservation as they've got some pretty cool things to look at around the hotel too. 5 stars for authentic and fun dining (^_^)"},{"name":"Causeway Restaurant & Bar","address":"65 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Absolutely worst bar I've ever been to!!!\\n\\nDo not waste money at this horrible establishment.

Why did I ever understimate Disney? The show was great fun, especially if you're a fan of deadpan humor and puns like myself, and the food was superb.\\n\\nThis is a great show to see if you're with a group of fun-loving adults. While kids do enjoy this, I'm not sure if they would understand some of the jokes and references until their teenage years. There's a lot of audience engagement, so if you're one who is more inclined to shy away from the performers, I definitely recommend Category 3 seats on the 2nd floor above the stage area.\\n\\nDespite having to cook a ton of food for such a large group of people, the food had lots of flavor. You start with a cornbread and honey butter, and the cornbread may have been my favorite part! There's also a delicious salad with fresh greens, tomatoes and onions with a nice vinaigrette. For your entrees, it's pretty hard to mess fried chicken up, and this fried chicken did not disappoint. It was one of the better fried chickens I've had, and that's saying a lot since some of my family is Southern. The beans and corn were also good, and I felt that the ribs and mashed potatoes average - nothing special but most definitely edible. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake is a perfect, light complement to a heavy dinner...if you have room.\\n\\nPerhaps my favorite part of the whole meal was the endless sangria! Yes, you get endless draft beer, wine and sangria with the meal! Don't expect a sangria with a ton of fruit in it - it's just garnished with an orange slice - but trust me, it's still just as good.\\n\\nOverall, it is a great show if you have the money and time to spare.

The table looked beautiful with china and crystal.  There were plates of fresh crunchy bread and oil already on the table to hold us over until we ordered.  We decided to start with a few appetizers and some cocktails. The drinks arrived promptly and all were spot on.  The appetizers started to appear on the table.  I believe the PEI Mussels were first to arrive, followed by Shrimp Scampi served with Grilled Semolina Toast and of course an Antipasto that was out of this world with to many items to mention but included English Stilton Blue (one of my favs) along with Long Stemmed Artichokes, Fabulous Assorted Italian Meats and so much more.  I have to say that each and every one of the Apps were excellent!  We polished them off in record time and awaited the arrival of our main course selections.  As the mains came out and believe it or not all 12 at the same time.  This kitchen definitely knows how to cook.  Each and every one of our dishes arrived hot, and cooked to perfection.  Scattered around the table were a Frutti Di Mare Fra Diavolo which included New Bedford Scallop, Cape Cod Littlenecks, Gulf Shrimp, PEI Mussels and Calamari Served Over Fresh Linguini.  There were also Dry Aged Center-Cut Prime Sirloin, Grilled & Served w/ Madeira Demi & Garlic Mashed and decorated with a couple stems of Asparagus.

I'm going back to Disney World!\\n\\n& for the 1st meal back on Disney soil, the girlfriend & I joined 1 of her coworkers for dinner at Jiko- The Cooking Place. After 1 week at Disney World over 2 separate visits & eating at 10 different restaurants on Disney property, 3 of which were Disney \\"Signature\\" restaurants, Jiko was my overall favorite.\\n\\nJiko is African Fusion. Checking into our reservations, we were seated after a few minutes.The decor is a clean & stunning execution of an African theme. Ambiance was quiet & relaxed while being a bit light & playful. Service was friendly & very professional. Our server didn't just facilitate our meal, she complemented it.\\n\\nOrdering was easy. The girlfriend's coworker knew the menu well & our server was an excellent guide to the choices available. We started off with an order of Crispy Beef \\"Bobotie\\" Roll & the Taste of Africa for the table. For entrees, I got the Braised Beef Short Rib with Truffled Potato Puree & the girlfriend got the Oak-grilled Filet Mignon with Sweet Corn Risotto.\\n\\nThe girlfriend's coworker had eaten here a number of times before & showed off his Jiko cred by ordering an item for us to try that is available but not on the menu: Mac & Cheese. Apparently, it was once the accompaniment for the Oak-grilled Filet Mignon but was replaced by the Sweet Corn Risotto.\\n\\nWhile contemplating drink to go with our food, our server recommended some African wines. We were all unfamiliar with these wines so our server provided us with a few rounds of tastings, after which we chose a South African Pinotage.\\n\\nOur starters were out shortly & were absolutely delicious.The Bobotie was meaty, spicy, savory goodness. The Taste of Africa was an assortment of tasty breads & tantalizingly spicy sauces. It was a good start to a meal that would get even better.\\n\\nOur entrees did take a little while, but our server was all over it. When the food arrived, it was so fabulous that the wait was quickly forgotten. My Braised Beef Short Rib was cut-it-with-a-spoon tender. Taking a full bite with some Truffled Potato Puree & washing it down with the Pinotage was a sublime symphony of flavors.\\n\\nI tried a couple bites of the girlfriend's Filet Mignon & it was exceptional. Only 4 days prior, we had Wagyu for the 1st time at a highly rated steakhouse in San Francisco. This Filet Mignon at Jiko was close to the quality of that vaunted Wagyu.\\n\\nFinally, there was the secret, off-menu Mac & Cheese. I liked it. I thought it was pretty good, but not supremely superb. I can see why the Sweet Corn Risotto replaced it on the menu as I preferred that slightly. The girlfriend, however, loved it. She's a bigger fan of Mac & Cheese, in general, than I am & she swore the Jiko Mac & Cheese was fantastic.\\n\\nThere was no room for dessert. We were done. Which was fine. Our dinner at Jiko was my best dining experience of all at Disney World. Decor, ambiance, service, food & wine were all outstanding & memorable. If I'm ever back at Disney World yet once more, I'll be going back to Jiko again as well."},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We stayed at this hotel so it would've been silly not to eat at this highly rated spot.

Buffet service offered wide variety of breakfast items ranging from waffles and eggs to African dishes that were out of this world. The food was fresh, flavorful, and interesting.

But fortunately it turns out the first pronunciation is right.... Boss-tone. And I like that, it reminds me of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and times gone past.\\n\\nWhat I didn't quite like was the small choice of thin-crust pizza. I prefer Upper Crust opposite where I can get a much bigger range of superior thin-crusts and I can also get a beer. Sadly your store also has less room, natural light and could do with UC's funkier decor.\\n\\nBUT.... I still think you deserve some good 3 star respect because Newbury St needs good places like you serving up cheap and quick eats, with newspapers and a TV in place. The rent is obviously tough so how you keep your prices so low must be some kind of magic trickery hocus-pocus. I've even heard you sell a cheaper slice now the Upper Crust.\\n\\nAND you did impress me with your dedication to the 'Sicilian' slice.

Everything on the menu is extremely heavy for a theme park in the middle of humid Florida. I ordered the quinoa salad which was the lightest thing I could find for lunch.

It is also accompanied by a flask of broth, a dab of wasabi, and an empty soup bowl and spoon.  Hmmm...not being a soba expert, I wasn't quite sure what to do next, and the waiter strangely didn't volunteer anything.  So I had to ask...\\n\\nThe proper enjoyment of this dish is achieved by the following steps:\\n1) Add the wasabi to the flask of broth and mix to dissolve\\n2) Pour all the broth over the noodles\\n3) Using your chopsticks, twirl them so as to spool up the noodles in the broth, like the Japanese-Italian you always wanted to be [Note: I can't seem to do this successfully, but you can watch a video of my dining companion doing this on my Facebook!]\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/boston.besteats/videos/vb.100006480267172/2171397523086235/?type=2&theater&notif_t=video_processed&notif_id=1480087911032715\\n\\n4) Dig in and enjoy the copious uni\\n\\nUnexpectedly, at the end of the meal, the reason for the empty soup bowl and spoon became apparent when a small teapot of the hot water the soba was cooked in was delivered by the waitress.  This should be combined with your remaining wasabi-broth in the aforementioned soup bowl and enjoyed as a nutritious and warm finish to the dish.\\n\\nI loved the uni soba, but the other dishes, served small plate style, were also wonderful.  We also enjoyed:\\n\\nIKA YAKI: Grilled whole squid ($8)\\n\\nSHISH ITO: Japanese green pepper ($2)\\n\\nNEGIMA: Chicken thigh and scallion ($3)\\n\\nENOKI: Mushroom w/ butter soy ($3)\\n\\nService was attentive, and they do now have a liquor license (although the cocktails tend to be the usual assortment of sweet asian-influenced creations).\\n\\nWHISKEY GINGER NINJA: Whiskey, ginger liquor, apple, lemon ($10)\\n\\nA big open space, with a small bar, attractive, but having a bit of a cafe feel to it. Some of the seating is communal at the larger tables.\\n\\nParking is easy.

Oh, he ordered a rueben. I.ordered a chicken sandwich....it was oooooooo.k. The chicken was chewy and the avocado in it was old. They clearly use older ingredients. And it was almost a ghost house.

All of this sounds like a good idea in theory, but I'm not quite sure it works in execution.\\n\\nThe waffle is Belgium's most famous export, divided into broad regional subcategories that have existed for hundreds of years: the Brussels waffle (gaufre molle) and the Li√®ge waffle (gaufre au sucre). What's the difference? Li√®ge waffles are made with a yeast-based brioche dough and include pearls of sugar that crystalize on the waffle iron. The sugar hardens during the cooking process so they're chewy on the inside and have a crisp, caramelized outside layer, much like cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Size-wise they're normally smaller and rounder than the Brussels waffle, which has a larger, rectangular shape. The light batter-based delight you have in the comfort of your home or in the barely wiped booths of your neighborhood IHOP covered with 5 pounds of whipped cream, powdered sugar, and fruits somewhat resembles the Brussels waffle. Lebeau sells both with the aforementioned toppings and fillings.\\n\\nSpeaking of neighborhoods, Patisserie Lebeau is located in what I can only describe as Exotic Car Row. Your view from inside is a McLaren dealership across the street, and you'll pass Bugatti, Maserati, Ferrari, and Lamborghini dealers on your way to the front door. As such I expected flawless artisanal pastries providing sweet sustenance to those who are in the area to drop half a million on a car.\\n\\nWhat I got instead were two sad waffles for a total of $4.22 USD. The Li√®ge waffles I ordered were displayed in a case of pastries made that morning. Typically enjoyed as a dessert or snack (rather than a breakfast food) in their native Belgium, good Li√®ge waffles are often tasty even at room temperature since they're brioche-like and full of glorious fat. As such the waffles were rich as expected but they were also, sadly, dry and lacking any texture on account of the cooled chocolate stuck to the tops, which essentially suppressed the sugary crispy exterior you normally enjoy with these. Thus both the dark chocolate orange and ruby chocolate varieties I tried were a disappointing mouthful, basically a dessert of wasted calories and bad first impressions.\\n\\nFor me, this entire concept would work better if the food was made to-order, but business seems to be prospering and other Yelpers primarily rave about the place, so I'll just file 'cold waffles' into the 'not my thing' category and call it a day. I've enjoyed waffles off the backs of trucks or from stands in the middle of the street a lot more, including in Brussels and Bruges, where there's pride in serving these puppies HOT.\\n\\nWith all of that said, while Lebeau specializes in Belgian pastries, there's more to the place than just waffles, and I'd return to give some of their other cakes and delicacies a try--next time I'm in the neighborhood Bugatti-shopping."},{"name":"Causeway Restaurant & Bar","address":"65 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I hate this place so much.

They said it was some of the best inexpensive Indian food in Atlanta so when I returned to home after a short work trip, we decided to give it a try.\\n\\nI was told that Zyka is not pronounced like Zika which is good for me preventing any confusion with the virus.

They have a team of cooks in the back. Even as we went when they had just opened the doors, there were 4 - 5 groups of other people ahead of us. The chefs in the back were already furiously cooking as we stood in line to order. Bag after bag of prepared food was set out on the counter as people came to pick up to go orders. I thought to myself that this must be the place to eat.\\n\\nIndeed it was. We were told to eat the chicken 65 which are boneless chicken morsels well marinated in familiar yet unfamiliar Indian spices. It has some heat to it which is dissipated with the sauces you use to dip it into. The chicken is moist and flavorful. No wonder it's so popular! We also ordered a couple main courses including butter chicken and mutton masala. Both incredibly tasty also with a bit of heat. Their prices are inexpensive but you do have to order your own rice and bread. Their entrees don't come with either. \\n\\nMake sure to save room for the kulfi which is Indian ice cream. Here they serve them in a clay pot. We've had the pistachio and the mango. The pistachio is heavenly. Even if you don't normally eat pistachio flavored treats or ice cream, this is a must try. You'll be surprised. The mango version tasted very much like a frozen mango lassi.\\n\\nYou can order to eat there, take away or have it delivered.

I asked him if he wanted me to pay now due to the fact that my payout receipt was in front of me before my food was even out, my goal was to keep ordering!! i paid for the food that i didn't eat and gave him a 50%+ tip but only because i didn't know how i was being discriminated and i wanted to teach him a lesson...i was literally the only one with a tab to pay in front of my eyes with no food...as a bar owner i know that this is not the ethics. not to mention i was the only one at the bar with a tab in-front......another reason why i would give this 1 star is because of the way the employee handle himself he served 3 employees drinks (free) before he even served me so another thing is that whoever the owner is make sure to follow up on the alcohol because at 3-4 drinks were served to employees while on the floor...i guess giving away free alcohol is more important than serving those who want to pay...im just shocked at how i was treated...first day in Portland and this is what happens....im originally from new york city and moved here for new venture and was totally not expecting this horrid service.....im so shocked its unbelievable.....oh and then he ran out and said sir do you want your food (being nice) maybe because i left him a big tip just to show him that everyone should be treated fair and equal....he was rude and giving away the whole bar to the staff!! \\n\\nUnanswered questions\\n\\nwhy was i the only one with a tab in my face before the food even arrived or my drink was made???\\n\\nwhy were you being rude when all i ask was \\"do you want me to pay now (thinking it was the end of his shift which i would've understand) i mean i was just trying to figure out why you offered me to pay up before anything was made....its just improper i will never come here ever and make sure those who are in my circle know this....so this is not a repetitive thing.\\n\\nSuggestions:\\n\\nStay away from the bar unless is a different guy than from the 2:30pm shift on tuesday! 1/5/16\\n\\nplease to management make sure all your employees are being nice and polite and have a sense of diversity because clearly this was personal for some reason....\\n\\nthis is literally my first one star review....i never like to give 1 star reviews but this was beyond horrible!!!"},{"name":"Stefano's Pizzeria","address":"9785 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"1","text":"garbage garbage garbage...staying at the All Star Resort...not allowed to say 0 stars...straight up garbage...100 bones down the drain...that's OK though! karma..."},{"name":"Papagayo","address":"331 Great River Rd","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"After seeing the food, we chose to only have drinks at the bar. \\n\\nPROS\\nI was able to find street parking right in front.\\nFriendly bartenders\\nClean bathroom\\n\\nCONS\\nComplimentary chips and salsa were meh.

The restaurant has an interesting (but not very photo-friendly) greenish lighting. Random: but I thoroughly enjoyed their music selections!  Some groovy tunes~\\n\\nSERVICE: Excellent!  Other than the usual attentive care that a restaurant at this price point usually provides, they were extra kind and offered to put the extra bags I was carrying with me (I was traveling) in the back room for me :3  So nice of them~\\n\\nDRINKS: I had Figure of Speech ($13); it was quite refreshing.  Very much what I expected though - your stereotypical fruity, herby gin drink.  Not in a bad way though!\\n\\nFOOD: My date had the Squid Ink Gemelli ($19), and I had the Uni Bucatini ($23).  We split a Crab French Fries ($9.)\\n\\nThe *Uni Bucatini* was good.  The smoked egg yolk surrounded the noodles in a viscous juicy-ness that complemented the bite from the al dente noodles.  However, there were only a few pieces of uni, which was a bit disappointing.  It's an expensive meat, but it felt a little misleading to have \\"Uni\\" featured in the title of the dish if there was so little on the actual plate.\\n\\nThe portion sizes for both my and my date's dish were wonderfully sizeable for their prices!  Usually restaurants like these have teeny tiny portions, about a bite or so of food, so it was really nice to indulge in a well-filled plate.  I even had to take some of my pasta home!\\n\\nThe *Crab French Fries* were also fantastic - very flavorful.  Worthy of note was the AH-MAZING chili mayo.  We took some of the fries home (again, great portion sizes) and our server was sweet enough to fill us extra sauce (score!)  I ended up eating chips with the extra sauce that we had, it was so damn good.\\n\\nIN SUM: Waypoint is pretty good!

On a Wednesday night, it was extremely easy to make (and change) a reservation for two people. The space is dim, making the fluorescent lights on the far walls more striking. Upon entrance, you are immediately entranced by the central raw bar, which makes oysters and clams on ice look almost like art. Art you're dying to devour.\\n\\nAfter seated in our nook, the very friendly hostess comes around to explain the menu to us first-timers. The majority of dishes are small plates meant to be shared, and they are brought out as soon as they're ready. There are also a few bigger dishes meant to feed 2-3 people. And she's happy to advise us along the way to ensure that we order enough food. \\n\\nNow to the drinks. I asked for her recommendation between a tequila-based one and one with rum. She immediately said to go with Duke's Pearls, a rummy concoction with house-squeezed passion fruit juice. I'm feeling passionate about this drink already.\\n\\nMy mom was trying to choose between two Italian reds, the waitress described them both, and my mom picked one. However, a few minutes later, our waitress returned with both bottles for my mom to try, so she could make the best decision! This level of service was unexpected and much appreciated.\\n\\nWaypoint would be great to come with a large group of adventurous eaters, so you can sample a variety of their interesting-sounding dishes. However, this was a mother-daughter date, so we went more simple: the ribeye with bone marrow & the squid ink gemelli with snails. \\n\\nThe pasta came out first and was reminiscent of the sea with the ink and the snails adding a salty flavor balanced by the lima beans. The pastas are all made in-house. And snails are now my new favorite add-in.\\n\\nThe 12 oz. ribeye came out later, a large plate with sliced steak, two bone halves, and toast with which to enjoy the marrow. The marrow was buttery and seasoned well, and the meat was fine in texture and taste (although a bit fatty in parts). This ribeye dish wasn't as impressive to me as the pasta, but what can you expect from a restaurant that focuses on coastal cuisine?\\n\\nThese two dishes were more than enough for us, and we took home leftovers.

We were warmly greeted by the owner in the shop, and was introduced to a wide variety of items as we asked for some recommendations. He suggested for us to try either the iTofu pudding or the iTofu drink with mango and coconut milk. We went with the iTofu drink with mango and coconut milk and our friends went with the iTofu pudding with redbean and grass jelly. \\n\\nOur order came a few minutes after we were seated, and it came on a cute wooden tray. I enjoyed my first few sips of the iTofu drink ($8) as I found a novelty to the combination of soy pudding, coconut milk, and mango. I liked how I could sometimes slurp up the mango bits, and each sip had a good ratio of coconut milk and tofu pudding. I enjoyed this drink, but did not feel that it was worth $8. \\n\\nThe iTofu pudding was soft and smooth, but nothing really stood out about either the tofu pudding, red bean or the grass jelly. I also thought it was very overpriced, it was $5.50 for the tofu pudding, and it costed an additional $1 for each topping ($7.50 in total).\\n\\nHowever, I really liked the interior. The walls were painted aqua blue, and there were detailed cute sketches of the city life (buildings, trains). The white and wooden tables and chairs also complemented the blue walls and it made for a welcoming and cozy place to hang. Additionally, the owner was very positive, enthusiastic and really enjoyed sharing his love for tofu and it really showed when he was explaining the menu to us. \\n\\nHis review - 2.5/5 stars: \\nTofu dessert is one of my favourite desserts, I was excited to try iTofu. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with the iTofu drink. I took many sips but was unable to find the uniqueness of this tofu drink. The ingredients used were very standard. The flavour combinations were nothing special. This dessert tasted like something I could easily make at home. For the price of $8, I wouldn't recommend coming and I probably won't be back anytime soon."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The worst sandwich i ever had a floppy tiny puddle.of sauce and shame. no meat. gross sauce. disappointing portions and the punch line of the joke is the childs side of chips and lolli pop given to further the insult. shame on you fresh to order."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"As a southerner, I'm a sucker for comfort food.

The fried wonton skins were an excellent addition to the soup.  It was very refreshing and full of flavor, making it very good on cold night.  The egg rolls were tasty and something different because the skin was of a different texture from the egg rolls I usually eat.  I like it here best!  The lo mein noodles were delicious as well.

For how many Dim Sum restaurants Vancouver has to offer, I always find myself coming back to this one. Every time I've come here it's been extremely busy, but since it is a large restaurant that has a capacity of 400, waiting times are never really an issue. Since it is in a busy plaza, the parking lot tends to be really busy and parking is sometimes tricky.\\n\\nI've only ever come here during their cart-style lunch service, which personally is my favourite way to eat Dim Sum. Something about getting seated at your table and getting your food less than 5 minutes later is very appealing to me. Just be careful because this place is a little bit on the pricier end, so it can really add up if you get a bunch of items. They have all your typical dim sum fare -- siu mai, hao gao, and every other deep fried favourite. \\n\\nI love coming here because I know what kind of food and experience I will be getting.

The dressing needed to be sharper, more herbs or something. It was dressed very simply, but too simply). Both of us enjoyed our meal and the service was great - any time we looked up to find our waiter, there was someone there to help us, even if he/she was not assigned to our table.

The ballroom, Beast's lair themed room, and portrait room were all absolutely beautiful. After looking at pictures online we were thrilled to have a reservation there and the in-person effect did not disappoint. Excellent work on the atmosphere!\\n\\nTo start, and this is our error not Disney's, we were under the impression this was a sit down meal. Be aware that sit down service is only available for dinner here. You walk in, order at a computer (and if you're in a group paying separately each individual check must be ordered separately) and then seat yourself. From there, an employee takes your receipt and goes to fill your order, which they then deliver to the table. Sort of a fast-casual vibe. Drinks are serve yourself as well and are only available in a veeeeery tiny area, which causes a lot of crowding, bumping, and awkward apologies.\\n\\nThis all could have been overlooked if the food was decent, but it was pretty terrible. My husband and I both got Gaston's breakfast spread and it came out with half as much food as the photo, straight up cold eggs, super greasy sausage, and lukewarm hash browns. Want ketchup? You have to hunt down a server who is probably running around to keep up with the meal rush to grab one out of a cooler for you. They'll have a huge smile and keep up that Disney magic, but you'll still feel like a jerk to have to ask.\\n\\nEvery restaurant we ate at in Disney (and more reviews will come!) was phenomenal, and this was the only that left us wishing we'd tried somewhere else. At $25 per person the quality just wasn't worth it. For $10 more you can have a bottomless breakfast at Garden Grill in Epcot complete with table service and characters! I'll be the first to admit that our incorrect expectations of it being a sit down character breakfast may have affected my judgement, so I am being generous with my rating to compensate, but for the price there are better options within the magical Disney park. I would consider skipping breakfast here, but lunch or dinner may be a better experience!

I also wish people understood the buffet area better; I didn't have a bad experience with people cutting in line or anything, but my friend happened to go the next day and had to deal with some pretty rude people. The host who seats you or the server should make it clear that yes, you have to wait in line for the savory entrees area, as well as whether or not the section that has the waffles/pancakes is a separate line (and if it's not, it should be).\\n\\nOverall I had a great breakfast but was it really worth $35?

The photos of wings made me hungry, so I decided to give it a try.  When I got to the place, it looked like a dirty little place, walls need painting, nowhere to sit except for 3 stools at a counter, and street only parking (good luck).  The one guy in there, older guy, was working the register, cooking, and answering the phone all at the same time. He didn't always wash his hands between tasks, and when be did, it was only for two seconds.  He was wearing flip flops and no hat or hair net as required by the health code.  I figured hot oil would kill that bacteria anyway, so I rolled with it.  \\n\\nI ordered the large wing basket (6 wings).  It took longer than usual to cook the order.  To my surprise, there was nothing large about that basket. The wings were not whole wings, just 6 wing ding parts (3 wings).  I got a bit of fries, and a container of cole slaw the size of the containers that usually hold condiments. The cole slaw looked watery in that container, so I didn't even try it.  The wings were okay, but not seasoned, and he doesn't clean all the feathers off the wing dings, which kinda irks me. \\n\\nMy experience was just \\"okay.\\"  I recommend that the owner paint the walls, wear a hat, get some help so the cook isn't handling money and the phone, and put some Lawry's seasoned salt on those wings.  That would at least get the place to a 4 star rating.  \\n\\nThis business will get some first visits due to the ads, but unless the presentation matches the social media posts, it won't survive the long term.  Especially, with Kentucky Fried Chicken, old reliable, right down the street.

I attempted to show the cashier how he had run me up incorrectly. He kicked up the rudeness factor x10 and would not look at the pictures I had taken of the correct pricing!

There was a lot of outdoor seating and there were several people out there. \\nDO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE HANDICAPPED unless someone can drop you off at the front door!  The front doors face east and just to the right(north) of the front door are THREE parking spaces for carry out plus 2 regular spaces. If you need to park in a handicap space, you have to park all the way at the other end of the building. My mother had to stop 3 times to rest before she got to the table, which was one table away from the north wall of the restaurant. So she had to walk the WHOLE length of the restaurant to be seated. If I sound a bit perturbed, it's bc I AM!  I saw the manager walk by and motioned him over and told him that I had a complaint about the handicapped spaces being at the opposite end of the restaurant. He said the City of Columbus was the one who chose where to put the handicapped spaces. Frankly, I don't think the City would do that but he said they did. Will I be calling the City to register a complaint?  You bet I will!!  It's terrible to have to watch your handicapped mother struggle to walk all that way!!  It's hard to believe that the 3 closest spots aren't for the handicapped but for carry out orders. \\nNow for the food. They have a daily special, Monday thru Friday, one for lunch and one for dinner. They also have a nice lunch menu with items that you can order any day, not just specific days. I ordered a half a flatbread & house salad combo which was only $5.99, which I thought was a great deal. The salad had lettuce, cheese, diced tomatoes, and purple onion. I had their spicy ranch which was not very spicy. The salad was decent. The flatbread had shrimp, andouille sausage, corn, scallions, and roasted red peppers. I opted to go for no red peppers bc they don't like me. Everyone had received their food except me and our server said they had made mine w the red peppers and they caught it & were remaking it. I thought that reflected well on our server for catching it before he brought it out. They asked if I wanted my salad & I said yes (rather than sitting there with nothing while everyone else ate). I was about 1/2 way thru my salad when they finally did bring my 1/2 flatbread. I'm including pics of it. I thot the toppings were pretty skimpy. It tasted ok but I sure wouldn't order it again. 3 people ordered the lunch fish & chips. 1 person loved it, 1 thot it was just ok &1 thot it tasted ok but was very greasy. 1 person received 3 pieces and the other 2 received 4 pieces but all pieces were about the same size.

I researched this meal like no other I've ever had.  Read reviews, looked at pictures from multiple resources, did extensive research on the wine list, etc.  So I had expectations walking in.  High ones.\\n\\nWhat I hadn't taken into consideration is the fact that, after all, this place is at Disney World and has to play to the Disney World crowd.  Now I'm going to sound like a...four letter non-Disney word...here but that crowd is not a crowd who typically is exposed to a great dining scene.  For many of them Olive Garden is what exists as Italian food, and a decent night out may be at the local Chili's or other chain establishment.  No knock on these people, just a factor of where they happen to live.  For those people this place is likely 5-stars and rightfully so.  Jiko is a very good meal.  For those people it's probably the best they've ever had.\\n\\nFor me - well I'm doubly fortunate.  Fortunate to live in a GREAT, approachable food city like Philadelphia.  Fortunate to have the time/money to eat out a good amount at the city's best restaurants.  This context is important.\\n\\nTo avoid a book here I'll be concise.  The food at Jiko is excellent. Entree portions are huge.  It is expensive - more so than much better restaurants in Philly. But it's at Disney so I expect that.  But nothing I ordered or tried (boar, taste of Africa, filet, duck) knocked my socks off.  But it was all very good.  Big, bold, wild.  Like Africa I suppose.  Same can be said for the wine, Kanonkop Pinotage 2010, which I understand to be less impressive than the 2009 or 2008 (award winning) versions but was solid if a bit rough around the edges.  Not worth $67 though at most places.  But was happy to try a unique varietal.\\n\\nSo - if you are lucky enough to dine out a lot in a good food city this will be a very solid meal.  The best I've had in Disney for what that's worth.

I'm not saying I haven't eaten some wonderful and authentic Cajun and Creole cooking in other regions of the country but in most instances the interpretation is lost somewhere along the way. Cajun food is a celebration of the rich and colorful culinary heritage of southern Louisiana and it takes more than a recipe to create the magic.  \\n\\nFire on the Bayou represents this style of cooking well, it offers some familiar renditions of the classics but without the local ingredients something is lost even with the intimate knowledge of the regions cooking style, although I have to admit I haven't had a dish that has come close to the true taste of Louisiana in this area until I walked through the door at this beautiful little restaurant.\\n\\nFirst of all the service here is extremely attentive and professional, the ice cold Abita Purple Haze on draft is the perfect brew to dampen the spicy tones you'd expect while enjoying these classic dishes.

I don't know how these burgers are supposedly good.  I further know that I'm going to get a lot of incredulous \\"What?!\\"s out of most of you readers, but I'm going to put my food-critic reputation on the line by saying that even McDonald's makes a tastier burger than does Mighty Fine.  Who else does?  Fran's, North By Northwest, Burger King (yeah, I said it), Little Red Wagon, and Hut's, to name a few.\\n\\nI tried out Mighty Fine with my boyfriend-at-the-time when they first opened a few years ago, but neither of us were impressed.  My burger (a \\"white\\") was barely passable in taste.  It had too little seasoning, or something.  And my bun was burned.  And the fries we got were the leftover broken burnt pieces you'd find at the very bottom of the fryer basket. Oh, you mean they're supposed to be horribly crinkle cut and overcooked?\\n\\nYesterday, I only got a burger and a drink, and, aside from the lack of french fries and a boyfriend, my lunch was a complete rerun of the last time I ate there.  I'm no backyard-barbecue bad-ass, yet I have easily cooked up better-tasting burgers on my backyard grill.  And then I remembered, Mighty Fine cooks their burgers on a griddle.  I think if they flame-broiled their burgers, they would taste a lot better.  Until that happens, you won't find me again at Mighty Fine sneering or making lemon-sucking faces.  And if they do take my advice and start cooking their burgers a different way, I would hope they'd be so good that I wouldn't have to make lemon-sucking faces as I'm eating.\\n\\nAnd I don't like the open tomato boxes sitting out in the dining room.  The fact that some schmuck could sneak a tomato into the bathroom, piss on it, and put it back in the box when he's done makes me ill.

I used to enjoy their food until tonight! I ordered through Postmates but chose the option of pickup. My order was for rib tips with double baked beans, and then I ordered a chicken wing plate with fries and a coke. I had my son go and pick up the order for me because I'd been ill and couldn't get out, so he only picked up the order dropped it off to me and left again. First, when I opened the box that had the chicken in it all I saw was fries, so I am checking the bag looking for another box and I said, wth is the chicken.. I noticed that there was a piece of wax paper under the fries and I lifted it up, boom! Chicken.. but the chicken wings were so small it looked like they were pigeon wings, the were dry and hard and barely had any sauce or any flavor at all, so I tried a fry, blah! Disgusting, it was like they had that plate fixed way earlier in the day and then tried to bring it back to life by refrying it! \\nI then opened the rib tip plate and it may have been 10 of the smallest tips I have ever seen with bbq sauce that had only been drizzled over the meat because tips weren't fully covered in sauce. I used a fork to push around the tips to further inspect them and a couple of them were gristle only no meat, the beans were thick, you can tell either they'd been on heat a long time or they were constantly reheated, but the flavor was good. Anyhow, the chicken plate was inedible which meant I had to order my youngest something else to eat cause his brother was gone and couldn't take it back. After this I got on postmates so that I make a review on the order! It allowed me to select that the quality of food was poor and suggested I contacted the restaurant since it was a pickup not a delivery! As per suggestion, I called the restaurant and a female answered the phone, she immediately knew I was the order from postmates and I asked to speak to management! She asked if she could help me and I told her I wanted to tell them about my food because it was horrible! She says, even the rib tips? So I knew for a fact, she knew more about my order than she put on... she placed me on hold after I told her about the chicken plate. Then, this male gets on the phone trying to make excuses immediately! When did you order, I'm trying to figure out who was cooking during that time. Well I wasn't here but I am going to see to it that they fix the problem. He suggested I come to get something else, I told him it wasnt possible for me to come and then he asked about the rib tips.. I gave him the same details and he began ranting about how rib tips have gristle like pig ears do... wtf?! What does pig ears have to do with why you are handing out meatless tips? So he goes on to tell me he buys the tips from the restaurant wholesale place like that!! So I suggested if you see tips with no meat on them then why not scrap those tips and not plate those? He then tells me some people like to eat the cartilage like they do when eating pig ears! And tells me I should think about that when I order rib tips... so now I'm flustered and I told him I don't give a sh!t about pig ears so he yells back that I must not give a sh!t about rib tips either!! Are you serious!? So I tried to inform him that rib tips are not meatless, even the stock photo they have up on the menu pages show a nice meaty rib tip!  So he, exacerbated, says well, contact postmates for a refund. And I told him postmates asked me to contact him... no they didn't??? ÔøΩ?I will never order from here again I'm now yelling!

The Blue Star maple bacon donut fits the bill of sweet but not too sweet, with smokey bacon, atop a very fresh-tasting fluffy donut.

A conversation with Ron Fisher of Petit Chou pointed me to Ah-Ma's (Granny in the Taiwanese dialect), for which I am very thankful.  \\n\\nMany of the Taiwanese classics are represented here--braised beef noodle soup, lu rou fan (stewed minced pork over rice), Taiwanese fried chicken--though there are a few notable exceptions, such as night markets classics stinky tofu and oyster omlettes, as well as pork chop rice.  \\n\\nThat said, most of the dishes we ordered were very good.  The Taiwanese fried chicken included dark meat chicken breaded (in potato flour?), fried, and mixed with basil...though I would've prefer the basil be less fried to preserve its aroma.  The lu rou fan we ordered was tasty thanks to its pork drippings.  And you should've leave without ordering the (braised) pork belly bao, topped with pickled cabbage, cilantro, and brown sugar.  While the Dirty Bird fried chicken bao is also popular, the pork belly is a much better value because it's much more labor/time-intensive: get it.\\n\\nWhat we also noticed was some of the twists the Taiwanese-American owner and his chef father integrated into the menu: there's the aforementioned bao; the use of chicken wings for the traditional Taiwanese Three-Cup Chicken recipe; as well as putting wheat gluten kaofu into the Taiwanese Noodles/Ganmian.  It's interesting, and mostly pulled off.\\n\\nWhat didn't really work for us were the Taiwanese sausages with lotus and lotus roots; the sausage tasted like a hybrid of Taiwanese sausage and kielbasa, and I thought the whole dish had too much Chinese five spice in there.  At $9, it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  The beef noodle soup was intriguing, but at $14, probably a few dollars more than I would want to pay sight unseen.\\n\\nService was excellent and there's a fine craft beer list.  Worth visiting even if you don't know Taiwanese cuisine at all, and definitely worth visiting if you do.  La Mei Zi may be rated higher, but I would put Ah-Ma's ahead."},{"name":"Tito's Burritos Mexican Flavor","address":"1921 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is your typical, cheap, Mexican fast food place.

The fish was swimming in a broth with a few chickpeas and a very small amount of spinach at the bottom of the broth.  The presentation was less than appealing.  My friend was even less impressed when she tasted her meal.

Let me preface my next statement by saying that my friend and I often go out to eat at high-end restaurants.  We are by no means accustomed to Buca di Beppo sized portions.  With that said, we both laughed when my plate was set in front of me.  It contained 3 medium-sized scallops and the scallops were covering the risotto, which barely peeked out from under them.  When I lifted the scallops and saw the meager amount of risotto I was given, I knew that I was going to leave hungry.  I paid $20 for that dish, and it truly was the size of an appetizer (if that).  If the food was absolutely amazing to taste, I would somewhat understand the cost.  This was not the case- it was not anything special.  I did let the waitress know that I felt that the portion size was very small for the price.  After talking with the chef, she informed me that the chef wanted to let me know that it was a \\"normal\\" sized portion of protein,and told me how much he had spent per lb on the scallops (I don't recall the exact amount).

The wait times are kind of long, even with a reservation, and without one, you'll be more than likely turned away as they fill up a couple months in advance. So if you would like to dine here, make your reservations at the 60-day window of you are staying on property, or at the 30-day window if you are not, to ensure a table. \\n\\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling. People are crammed everywhere. This is not a relaxing respite by any means. You very much feel you are in a crowded theme park, even though the architecture outside the restaurant and inside is quite beautiful. Sound reverberates off the huge,  vaulted ceilings so it is a cacophony of noise.  I'm not particularly put off by that kind of thing, but it's certainly not a romantic atmosphere. \\n\\n I didn't find the pizzas to quite live up to their hype, though. They seemed hastily made, with a few stingy ribbons of basil pooled off to one side on the Margherita Pizza. The eggplant pizza lacked salt, so it all seemed to blend together into soft mush.

For some reason you get a better looking meal when it's brought out to you on a plate with the chips placed nicely around your sandwich, and the sandwich is presentable and nice looking. I ordered the same sandwich as before, the California Club.  This time it was put together much better and the guacamole was not brown.

Our favourite savouries were the thai red curry egg salad, chicken salad and the lemon cream cheese although all were quite good. The sweets that we enjoyed the most were the hazelnut and pear financier, mango passionfruit mousse and the pumpkin cardamom cheesecake! Desserts were all not too sweet and perfectly sized for a small bite. Mom and I actually packed more than half of this home (since it was an awkward time between lunch and dinner) but left quite satisfied.\\n\\nThe teas here are the best part because they let you try as many as you want! I was able to try 4 today and since it was evening, I stuck to herbal and rooibos. My favourite was definitely honeysuckle which was light, refreshing and so very smooth.

I sat while my husband and friends ate their meals (they did not see the cockroach) when suddenly another employee comes out of the back with a ladder and a ceiling tile to change one over the pizza buffet that was bowing out due to water damage. They made customers get up and move so they could do this. Why couldn't they have changed the ceiling tile before they opened? Every single employee, including the manager, stood around the ladder while the other employee tried (and failed) to change it. Customers stood at the register waiting to be served and eventually left since everyone was huddled around the ladder. It wasn't until two customers walked up with a child and the CHILD told them it had to be cut to fit. Then they went into the kitchen to cut it!

So I was hoping presentation would be more meticulously considered. Oh well--the food redeemed it! I loved the buttery crustiness of the bread and there was plenty of salmon to go around.

Followed with a whiskey-based lemon flavored cocktail, refreshing and crisp. \\n\\nThe stars of the show were Overnight Roasted Tomato Pie with Sausage and the Oven Roasted Quail.  Wood-fired pizza has always had a special place in my heart. Using a wood-fired oven on well-made dough results in a random pattern of crispy and softer parts of the dough which adds a complex texture.  Waypoint's toppings rarely disappoint and the smoked ricotta and sausage combination was beautiful. \\n\\nQuail is a challenging food to cook, yet Waypoint executed masterfully.  The Quail's crispy skin and juicy meat were able to take on some of the flavors from the smoked oyster filling.  I found the sauce performed a delicate balancing act reducing the intensity of the smoky flavor in a manner that I wish I could emulate.  Bravo!\\n\\nMy only recommendation is that if you intend on visiting Waypoint, call ahead and ask for a window seat.

My first real mistake I didn't try the coffee while waiting for my bagel, but seriously how can one mess up coffee you ask? Let's start with there are more grounds in the coffee than flavor.

The next issue not a big one more of how I feel a to-go order should be treated, no napkins in my bag. But that's big the big issue just a pet peeve of mine. The bagel was burnt on the outside and yet just lightly toasted on the inside, the burnt flavor combined with flavorless coffee made it even that much harder to wash it down. You would think this was the only issue? Sorry then comes the sausage. I am a fan of sausage and not really sure how you ruin them but this place found a way.

This includes fried chicken, ribs, corn, mashed potatoes, cowboy beans, and if you ask nicely Mac and cheese. The fried chicken is my option the best fried chicken around. It is not a heavy coating of batter, the flavor of the chicken is allowed to come through. It also has a nice crunch to it. The ribs are also yummy. They are not huge but they are unlimited, so eat up. The mashed potatoes are creamy and have the skins in them, they are not too heavy. Cowboy beans are my favorite. They have. Pulled pork in them and are nice and tangy and I like to mix the corn into them on the plate. I believe the Mac and cheese may be Stouffer's and there is nothing wrong with a little home comfort food. \\nThe production for dessert is cute, the servers are on stage and bring out your strawberry shortcake with a little kick!!   \\nThe show is enjoyable old west saloon show.

Just to give some context. Context that I was never going to stay more than 5 minutes past closing.\\n\\nI had heard great things about it, so I was pretty excited. When I ordered, the guy at the counter was super nice and very honest about what he liked and didn't like as much, and I totally appreciated that. He was really sweet. I got a latte, and at first I thought it looked awesome with the great latte art and everything, but the foam was at least an inch or inch and a half thick. It was intense. Not great, but not awful. At this point, I probably would have given it 4 stars, still pretty good, but could be better.\\n\\nAround 4:15, I had finished my latte, but I was still working and thought it would be nice to try their drip coffee. It was terrible. In all likelihood, it had probably been sitting out for a while, but it was watered down and flavorless. Still, this probably only would have dropped my rating to 3 stars, because it's kind of understandable if it was just old coffee, but I wish someone would have given me a heads up and suggested I get something else (it's not like I would have asked them to brew a whole pot just for me, that would be really silly)\\n\\nBut then. Around 4:10, they started closing up. Like doing the table-wiping stuff and the norm, and that was fine. That stuff was no big deal, but the way they starting treating those of us still in the coffee shop come about 4:50 was not good. One of the girls working started wandering (seemingly) aimlessly back and forth from the bar to the exit door, except I don't think it was actually aimless since she kept staring at us (me and two other tables). One table left immediately, the other noticed around 4:55 and started packing up their things. The girl working there went and stood right next to their table and hardly looked at them as she said \\"have a good night\\" ... but they didn't even have their stuff in their bags yet!! It's not like they were walking towards the door and she said it as they were walking out... they hadn't even finished packing up their things. For me, I was planning to leave after I finished the LSAT problem I was working on. But after the girls made their way out the door, the girl was trying to lock it behind them... except it was really uncomfortable, because she'd make a half-hearted attempt to lock it (and fail?), and then look pointedly at me. I just wanted to finish the LSAT problem I was working on. But every time I looked down at my screen, I felt her eyes on me and I'd look up and she was staring me down!! So I just gave up and left.\\n\\nI've worked at 4 different restaurants and a coffee shop, and that's not how you treat closing, ever! When we closed up my coffee shop, we were really discreet and we did all the non-invasive stuff we could first, even if it was past closing. Because honestly, why bother people who are working or having a good time unless it's legitimately past closing and there's nothing else you have to do before you leave? I remember when we would close, sometimes we would warn people, \\"Hey! We technically close at 5 (or whatever) so I'm just going to lock the door now (if that), but feel free to stay and work or talk or whatever, just don't mind us as we close up!\\" And people are super understanding of that, and usually they leave pretty quickly after that anyways, but it doesn't leave this bad taste in their mouth of getting stared down until they left..."},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom Orlando","address":"11680 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'm going to start off by saying i'm usually a fan of Mellow Mushroom.

I'm guessing that the lid must have fallen off of the cheese shaker and they just didn't think it would matter (especially since it was take out). They were not edible...

I was having my car worked on at Ron-Jon's Automotive, which is just down the street. When asked if I would be waiting there while my car was being worked on, I told the service attendant that I was looking to go have breakfast while waiting. I inquired as to whether there was a place nearby that serves breakfast, and he recommended Shannon's. \\nIt was within five minutes walking distance. But have you ever tried to use the cross walks at Orange Avenue and Holden Avenue? Talk about an adventure for pedestrians! Give yourself a few minutes just in wait time after you press the button for the crossing signal. Then you get 30 seconds to cross, and that timer moves fast! And you know that there is always that one driver looking to make a right hand turn on red giving you the evil eye.\\nAnyway, after crossing the street safely and making my way into Shannon's, I approached the counter and gave them my order. After you give the server your order and pay for your meal, you are then told to serve yourself to the beverages around the corner of the register to the left, and your order will be brought out to your table. I grabbed a cup of coffee and a glass of ice water and selected my table right across from the counter. There is a larger dining area on the other side of the restaurant where several other diners sat. From the looks of things, Shannon's Casual Cafe has a good thing going, especially with the locals.\\nThe breakfast menu consists of breakfast sandwiches, a three pancake platter, French  toast platter, two eggs platter, and a three egg omelet. Bacon, ham, and sausage are offered with the platters. On the egg platters, grits or hash browns and toast are offered. \\nI ordered two eggs with sausage, hash browns, and toast. The cost is $4.79. With coffee, the bill came up to a little over $6.00. A good price for a good breakfast. My food was served in a timely manner, and was delivered to my table hot.\\nAlthough my breakfast was good, I had two problems concerning my meal and menu selection. With the two eggs platter, you are given a choice of either hash browns or grits. I ordered the hash browns, which happened to be the hash rounds, those little tater-tot like potato bites. The hash rounds were good and hot, but I was thinking more in the lines of the shredded potato hash browns. On my next visit, I will most likely go with the grits. \\nSecond, I was disappointed that I did not see pancakes listed on the menu for breakfast sides. I like to get a side of pancakes when I go out for breakfast, and most restaurants offer pancakes on the side. When I asked the waitress about this, she informed me that they could do a combo with pancakes if I liked. So the next time I am here, I will have to remember that.\\nShannon's is not close to where I live. But if I am in the area, I would stop in again for breakfast. Shannon's is open from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and serving lunch and dinner. Salads, sandwiches, and burgers are served, along with platters featuring fried clams, chicken tenders, fried shrimp, fried cod, and catfish fingers. I noticed that wings are on the menu. So I may have to stop in one evening and try some Buffalo wings. There is also an area serving ice cream, whether it be cones, sundaes, or shakes. Dinners are served from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Daily dinner specials are also featured.\\nAs for the dining area, the tables are clean, as well as the counter/kitchen areas and the bathrooms. Service is friendly and helpful with any questions you have regarding the menu. The decor has a homey feeling to it, and even the diners are friendly.\\nHow can you have a bad breakfast when you have a child saying hello and waving to you and other diners while she is waiting at the counter with her mother? \\nI think that is a great way to start the day.

And it's just My Humble Opinion, but the BBQ at Dirty Glove is as good as or better than anything I've ever had from Franklin's, La Barbecue, Black's, and all the rest. \\n\\nThere's a menu, but Beef Brisket and Pork Ribs are the name of the game here. Brent gifted me a slice of brisket hot off the grill, I took a bite, and it was like a small religious experience came down upon me. \\n\\nWhen I go out in pursuit of BBQ, I always over-order. Because the saddest sentence in the English language is \\"We're out of BBQ\\". And also I'm from the school of thought that dictates that one should always be able to reach into one's refrigerator and grab a quick bite to eat. If that bite consists of leftover BBQ, that means we're all having a really good day.\\n\\nYesterday there was but a single pork rib left in my refrigerator. And I ate it cold, leaning over the kitchen sink - I know, I'm disgusting - but I was indulging my primal solitary carnivorous man-beast nature. You can't do that with just any pork ribs. But you can do it with the pork ribs from Dirty Glove BBQ. And there was a *lot* of meat on that one single rib. There's a downside to this: I have to hit the confession booth this Friday, because anything that makes you say \\"Oh My God!\\" more than five times in ten minutes is pretty surely a sinful act of some kind or another.\\n\\nThey offer two kinds of BBQ sauce, both have a notable molasses note that I found agreeable - but Dirty Glove serves the kind of BBQ that doesn't *need* sauce.\\n\\nThey also serve coney dogs. I've gotta sink my teeth into one soon.\\n\\nOkay, in the interest of being fair and balanced and providing an honest (if unapologetically exuberant) review, there is a real downside, and it is that - at the time I'm writing this - Dirty Glove's hours of operation are a bit sketchy. I hope the situation is a bit more stable by the time you are reading this. But it's like a law of nature or maybe economics: whether it's standing in a long line, or waiting until 4pm Tuesday, or pulling into the parking lot and seeing a sign in the window that says \\"sorry, we're out of BBQ\\" and vowing to return tomorrow  - laying hands upon the best BBQ takes real effort. I sometimes wonder if Heaven is a place where you can say \\"hey, let's go grab some BBQ\\" and five minutes later you're digging into a rack of amazing ribs.

No sign of those frighteningly hot to most Sichuan peppers, and it had as much kick as the 'hot' sauce at Anna's Tacqueria. The rice was done fairly dryly, even for basmati. The vegetable mix could be a little better in selection. Broccoli seems a bit odd in coupling with bok choy for the dish, not going well with the sauce... if tossed with the sauce.

The pizza was a bit pricey at $24 bucks, but completely worth it. The wings were supposed to be $6.95 for six, but they ended up being $.50 cents each, so that was nice. I don't know if that's a regular special or not. The ranch dressing we got with the wings ended up being $.75 cents.

An appetizer, entree, and dessert for $25 is a steal at such a classy joint, in my opinion. I highly recommend the Trout in Rose sauce. Melts in yr mouth. Salmon Pate on crusty bread was unexpectedly delightful. Don't even get me started on the Chocolate Mousse. Much as you would expect, you're highly encouraged to eat and drink the day away without being bothered. It's nice to just sit and chat without worrying about the next place you're going right?

Me and a friend were in the mood for Mexican food. We decided to try El Tacoriendo for lunch. Great choice!!\\n\\nIt's a smaller sized restaurant. Tables take up all the space. When Stephen and I got here (close to noon on a Saturday), several of the tables were taken. We located an empty one in the back corner and headed toward. A young lady (perhaps college age) brought us menus. She was polite - in a good mood considering it was a small blizzard outside. Answered all of our questions about the different dishes. We got chips and guac to start. After much self agony, I picked a pork and chorizo burrito and a Tortas Cubana.\\n\\nI can say with confidence that the Guac here is quite possibly the best I've ever had! Not salty. Not doused with onion or garlic. Super smooth texture. Perfect sized chucks of avocado. My mouth is craving another size of it, just talking about it! And for $3.50? So worth it!\\n\\nEeny Meeny Miny Mo determined the Burrito as the starter. Interesting: The seasoned pork was crumbles; I was expecting pulled, but this was great, nonetheless. perhaps a bit less seasoning next time, but nothing to complain about. And the chicken chunks mixed was a pleasant contrast. All the fixings mixed in, soft, flavorful shell, all amounted to bliss. I was stuffed after eating that large burrito, I had to transfer the Torta to a to-go container. I'll be sure and update after eating it :p\\n\\n***This location has a brick and mortar restaurant.

My friends and I decided to stop by Sweet Carrot for dinner. For YEARS, I have heard fantastic things about the restaurant. People raved about the Mac n Cheese, the Fried artichokes, the corn cakes, and the meats for years. I am proud to say that the hype is real and worth it!\\n\\nI tried the Salad topped with Pulled Pork. The cashier talked me into adding a scoop of Mac N Cheese for an extra $2. I caved in and it was the best decision I made that day! The salad is huge it comes out on a cast iron looking plate. The kale salad is pre-dressed with a light and lovely vinegarette. It comes topped with a protein of your choice, corn salsa, vinegar cole slaw with a side of BBQ sauce. The salad was yummy to eat on its own. The pulled pork was moist. However, there was nothing special about the BBQ they serve it with. It just tastes like a generic BBQ sauce. The show stopper was the mac n cheese which was  very cheesy and rich! I definitely could not have eaten more than 1 scoop! You can curate the perfect bite by adding a little bit of BBQ dipped pulled pork to a fork of mac! \\n\\nNext time, I definitely want to try to fried artichokes for myself. The picture attached was my friend's meal and she can say for herself that it tastes as good as it looks!\\n\\nAdditional notes about sweet carrot:\\nService: The staff are all super friendly. They were happy to explain the menu to me and helo me make a choice! It is also nice that they bring your food to your table. :)\\n\\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is hip and cute. Its definitely a nice place to grab a meal with friends or family. There is surprisingly more seating than you think. The decor of the place is nice as well! If you get a chance, I highly recommend sitting outside on the patio.\\n\\nCaution: The parking at Sweet Carrot is limited. There are street meters but they can be difficult to acquire due to the street's busy nature and the popularity of Grandview ave.

The best thing is that the menu changes every two weeks so the food I'm reviewing might not even be there! As soon as you walk into the place you are hit with a massive raw/oyster bar on display with a few chefs tending to it. It looks delicious and shows you why you should order the oysters. The servings are perfect size to share with your other friends. There was three of us and we ordered three apps. We ordered half dozen oysters, corn stone fruit salad, and the crab dusted fries. I don't have enough good things to say about them. The oysters are perfect for slurping. They come out of the shell very easily and there is no shell or salt inside, just a big meaty oyster. The crab dusted fries were very crispy and came with these great aoili sauce. And the corn salad with a stone fruit over corn with some avocado. All very fresh and precisely seasoned to perfection. As for the meal I went with the clam pizza. You need to order these either as an appetizer to share or as a meal for yourself. The pizza was thin crusted with garlic, olive oil, Parm cheese and cooked clams. The crust was crispy and thin so it did not feel to heavy in the stomach. We ended our meal with the fruit puff. It was the fall season in a pastry. It was an applie puff almost like an apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top with a ginger bread cookie. This was a good dessert to share. The ice cream was a creamy vanilla and melted over the warm apple puff.\\n\\nThe service here was fantastic as well. The waitress really knew the menu well and was very attentive all meal.

Off to a good start.\\n\\nFirst was the Caesar salad; okay, not bad, not extraordinary. Then I had the chicken and shrimp fresca, which was actually really good.

Decadent, very chocolate-y, overall pretty good.\\n\\nSo the food was great in general. But the service....eh. While I was eating my entree, the waiter came around many, many times to check up on me. Finally, I just told him to take my dish away with my last remaining shrimp. Came over constantly to refill my water, which really didn't need much refilling, but I suppose it was to check up on the food not-very-subtly. \\n\\nWhen it came time for the check, after I had tipped on the card, I was still waiting for my lunch buddy to come out of the bathroom.

My first impression of the place was that it was so \\"meh\\" looking. It wasn't the cute little shop I'd envisioned. I was happy to find that they were open late so we could swing by after dinner for a sweet treat. We entered to find some products for sale out front and cases of ice cream (made on site) and marshmallows. The marshmallows are small cubed shaped things that look at first to be freeze dried. They are indeed soft as we learned. I was kind of confused by the menu as to what things were (there was no explanations) and considering the high cost (one S'more was $3 something?!?)\\n\\nAfter chatting with the nice employee we ended up with three small ice creams ($3 something each) and a trio of skewered, toasted birthday cake flavored mallows ($3 something). I don't remember the exact prices but we were kind of shocked at how pricey everything was. They do think very highly of their product! I thought it funny that they serve their cups of ice cream with a sample sized spoon. Probably to make you feel like your actually getting more for your money than you did! Seriously, a regular sized spoon and you could eat the \\"small\\" sized cup in about 4 bites. This was the main reason they earned only 2 stars. The mallows were good but not knock my socks off good. The ice cream was the same. We even left with a box of s'more mallows, they were just ok too.\\n\\nEspecially considering the price I just cannot justify more than two stars. Had it been priced better I would give 3 stars.

In some respects the rep is correct.  I was to meet several friends there on a Friday night to listen to a live band and have drinks. The friends range in age from mid 30s to +70 years of age.  So we're talking about a lot of coverage age wise.\\n\\nI arrived ahead of most and saddled up to the bar in the main lounge/restaurant area.  La Scala seems to be bracketed in a way that puts those with reservations in all kinds of nooks and crannies. There is a main area for dining that is level with the dance floor and band. Other areas are off to the side, behind walls, tucked in to far away corners, mid-level rooms and such.  Actually, it's cobbled together nicely if you are a patron and know to ask for seating off from the band.  Otherwise you'll get lots of sound and be seeing lots of dancing.\\n\\nFour of us dined on personal pizzas.  Both were very good (pep and sausage;  white pizza with artichoke and chicken).  Drinks were good pours so no complaints in the beverage arena.  Our table was behind a wall; we could see a portion of the dance floor but didn't have loud loud music so that was good.\\n\\nI mentioned getting there ahead of everyone else.  I noticed immediately over 75% of those enjoying La Scala on a Friday night were 50s and up.  And I gathered as the evening wore on these folks (myself included) were there for food but also to dance.  The dance floor was never empty and patrons were having a great time.  I've got to say that folks who know the 50s, 60s and 70s are lively and love dancing, fast and slow. La Scala doesn't seem to be set up for anyone in their 20s - 40s to have a dinner-only experience.\\n\\nThe server we had was too non-chalant with attention and was noticed twice talking with tables and not producing \\"another round\\" or \\"checks please\\".  Too much down time between check-ins.  The cost for a pizza and four adult liquor drinks came to $50.  That seemed higher than expected.\\n\\nI cannot in all honesty recommend La Scala to a younger crowd.  But on any given Friday if you want to shake a leg on the dance floor to live music and have decent food and drinks... La Scala will be a nice treat."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I really like Mighty Fine burgers.

My friend ordered the Untitled, which had Amaras Mezcal, Avion Silver, Cocchi Barolo Chinato, Citrus, Earl Grey Bitters, and Ginger Beer. It had a smokey taste, but it was quite refreshing. The Citrus-Cured Kampachi came with Rice Chicharrones, Cilantro, Benne Lime Vinaigrette, Lemon Dashi, Jalape√±o, Crispy Ginger. It was a great, little app. Fresh and flavorful. For dessert, our server highly recommended their newest item, Lemon (Meringue) Tart. It has a base of vanilla sable topped with lemon curd, lemon whipped cream, and meringue that is then caramelized and garnished with crispy lemon meringue pieces and candied lemon! It was the ZEST! Get it? Seriously, though probably the best lemon tart I have ever had! Perfect balance of sweet and tart.

The pizza, in its eastcoast genre, was nicely done, though the ingredients failed to jump out; their taste was a bit lost in the sauce.

We had cancelled our Narcoossee's reservation since my toddler was injured (long story) and we were staying at Animal Kingdom Lodge.  It's very convenient for those staying at the hotel.  \\n\\nThe service was severely lacking and at the standard Disney 18% gratuity (which we gave anyway), was definitely NOT worth it.  The pacing was very very off.   It took us about 15 minutes to get seated, another 10 minutes to get drinks.  While we got our appetizers w/in 5-7 minutes of ordering, our entrees took another 20-30 minutes.  By the time we got our entrees, we packed the entrees up (after a few bites) and dessert up to go since we had been at the restaurant for about 1.5 hours already.  Not acceptable, especially since we had 2 kids with us and did not order alcoholic drinks.  \\n\\nOn to the food.\\n\\nAppetizers\\n1.  Pork, Wahoo, Arugula salad---4 stars for the melty, delicious pork.  3.5 stars for the arugula salad and dressing (hard to mess up, though), and 1 star for the Wahoo.  The pork was braised and fatty, crusted with a sweet char.  Delicious.  Salad average.  The wahoo was disappointing.  It was caked in some of super salty coating.  The fish was not seasoned well, and every bite was super salty on the outside, bland on the inside.  For $17, this salad was a MISS.\\n\\n2.  Chicken Flatbread----5 stars, if you love goat cheese (which I do).  If you don't love goat cheese, this thing will stink you to high heaven.  It's basically a flatbread pizza topped with goat cheese, a bit of pesto sauce and chicken.  Very fresh, very good.\\n\\n3.  Beef roll ---ugh skip.  Its like a curried beef fried in oily, dense pastry dough.  The texture is not appetizing, and the curry spices overpowered the meat.  SKIP.\\n\\n\\nEntrees\\n\\n1. Oak fired Filet Mignon w/Mac & Cheese----DELICIOUS.  5 stars.  Melt in your mouth goodness, cooked perfectly medium rare.  Good char, good flavoring.  We ordered it with the Mac & Cheese (not on the menu any more) and the mac was disappointing and grisly.  Overall a 4 star plate, since the Mac didn't live up to expectations (or reviews).  \\n\\n2. Seared Duck breast---1 star.  Gamey, chewy, sinewy, and overcooked.  So so so so sad that I ordered this and not the Filet.  I took one bite of this, frowned,  Took one bite of the filet, and packed the rest of this \\"to go.\\"  Never ate a bite of it afterwards.  Yuck.\\n\\n3.  Swordfish---we made sure to order this medium rather than cooked well done as the Chef prepares it.  At medium, the fish was cooked perfectly.  The seasoning was good but it was nothing spectacular.  A good solid fish choice for a restaurant that focuses on meats.\\n\\nDessert\\n1.  Cheesecake--surprisingly tasty.  Not overly sweet.\\n\\n2.  Flourless Chocolate Cake--overpowered by a liqueur taste.  Ugh.  Can't get that taste out of my mouth.  Definitely skip.\\n\\nWe were disappointed by our visit to Jiko, especially because we stay at Animal Kingdom all the time and wish that there was a Signature restaurant we liked.  For the price, I would have preferred to have kept our Narcoossee's reservation or even have tried out Yachtsman Steakhouse or Artist Point.  \\n\\nThe worst part was the very very poor pacing of our dinner.

The first restaurant opened in 1994. I'm not sure what the setup is. The business feels like a chain, but each restaurant appears to be independently owned and operated. The decor/design and menus aren't consistent between locations.\\n\\nFor years, this Chin Chin used to exist on the far end of the Kroger shopping center, next to Mama Niki's Pizza. In November 2016, the restaurant moved to its current space on the opposite side of the shopping center next to American Deli. The space used to belong to El Amigo Mexican Restaurant, a popular Georgia Tech hangout. El Amigo closed and moved in November 2013 after 35 years. https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-amigo-mexican-restaurant-atlanta\\n\\nThis Chin Chin serves both Chinese and Japanese cuisine. This is not a run-of-the-mill Chinese takeout joint. It's a nicer sit-down style restaurant with a classy, but casual dining room, display kitchen (behind glass windows), and a sushi and wine bar. Seating consists of booths and tables. There are TVs and tasteful Asian decor and lighting. I would consider this an Americanized Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nThe restaurant offers lunch specials 7 days a week (11:30am to 3:00pm, Monday through Friday and 12:00pm to 3:00pm, Saturday through Sunday). They include Chinese entrees under $10 each, bento boxes (e.g. chicken teriyaki, chicken katsu, spicy tuna poke with sides) for about $12 and up each, and sushi lunch combos for $10-15 each.\\n\\nAt dinnertime, you can expect to spend under $10 each for most Chinese appetizers and roughly $12 to $20+ each for entrees that include chicken, beef, pork, seafood, vegetables, noodles, and fried rice. On the Japanese side, they offer an assortment of traditional and Americanized sushi rolls, the latter costing about $12+ per roll. They also have a basic selection (e.g. tuna, salmon, yellowtail) of nigiri (~$5 for 2 pieces) and sashimi (~$10+ for 5 pieces).\\n\\nWe used a Yelp check-in offer to get a free order of vegetable egg rolls (menu item #A03, regularly priced at $3.25). Two small-to-medium sized fried egg rolls were served atop shredded cabbage with sides of Chinese hot mustard and duck sauce. The egg rolls tasted a little funny to us, but it wasn't a flavor I haven't experienced before at other Americanized Chinese restaurants. These were just typical, cheap, takeout-quality egg rolls. I wouldn't order these normally, but they weren't bad for the price (free).\\n\\nI ordered two items off the Chef's Specials under the Chinese section of the menu. (We didn't try any sushi.)\\n\\n* CS06. Three Cups Taiwanese Chicken ($14.95) - cauliflower, bamboo shoots, hot pepper, black mushrooms, spicy ginger garlic brown sauce\\n* CS16. Beijing Duck (half $18.95, whole $35.00) - served with cucumber, scallions, crepes, and plum sauce\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised to see Chin Chin had these more authentic dishes on the menu and looked forward to trying them. They were alright.\\n\\nThe menu says the three-cup chicken is Taiwanese, but technically, the dish originated in China and later became popular in Taiwan. Most people (myself included) associate three-cup chicken with Taiwanese cuisine. The food was served the traditional way, in a clay pot. The broth/sauces were still bubbling when the dish hit the table. The dish is called three-cup chicken because of the three cups of sauces required in the recipe.\\n\\nOther ingredients in Chin Chin's version of this dish included asparagus and basil. Overall, this dish struck me as a little bland. It was probably the least flavorful three-cup chicken I've had. Ordering a less expensive regular dish from the chicken section of the menu probably would have been just as good, if not better.\\n\\nThe Bejing duck (a.k.a. Peking duck) was authentic. We ordered a half portion and got two legs, chopped meat, and crispy skin. To eat Peking duck the traditional way, you basically have to make wraps using the supplied crepes (or pancakes) and ingredients. If you're not sure how to do this, ask your server. In a nutshell, unfold a crepe, spread some plum sauce down the middle, then add duck, cucumber, and scallion, and wrap everything up. Voila. Peking duck crepe.\\n\\nI like how Chin Chin serves plenty of crispy duck skin with its Peking duck. Overall, the duck was crispy, flavorful, and tender, but also quite salty. Adding the plum sauce to the already salty meat and skin made the wraps too salty. I would order this dish again if it wasn't so salty. If you decide to order it, allow the kitchen some extra time to prepare it.\\n\\nService was good. Our server was very attentive."},{"name":"Cin√©polis Luxury Cinemas Hamlin","address":"14111 Shoreside Way","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the funnest places I've worked.

Steaks were very nicely done with a great char on the outside, cooked perfectly to order on the inside.

The soup was topped with a generous layer of gooey cheese and was good for dipping the complimentary bread in. Before we could even finish, they brought out our entrees. My boyfriend got the Grilled Strip Steak and I got the Shrimp & Scallop Pasta. The steak was cooked well, but not perfect. It was a tad chewy. The pomme frites were not the traditional skinny French fries, but more like thicker steak fries, which were still tasty. I surprisingly really enjoyed my pasta. It had the right amount of seafood, and the lobster sauce had great flavor. I wish there was more, but I know I would have been stuffed after.\\n\\nSaving room for dessert, we had to try the Grey Stuff.

The pull pork and brisket were good.  I was not a fan of the sausage, it had a good snap, but it was too peppery, which is something I really don't like. The sides we went with were Hush puppies and Mac and cheese - neither were their best efforts, the fires looked like a better choice,\\n\\nOn each table they have 5 sauces, Original, Hot, Really hot, Sweet,  Mustard.

They follow the same formula here at Rose's that they do at HA.  The main difference is that at Rose's they seem to have a bigger kitchen and prep area and are able to serve 3 different Vietnamese Noodle Soups a day (on Wed, Fri, and Sat) rather than the 2 at HA and VL.  \\n\\nRose's also serves banh mi sandwiches which is no longer offered at HA and VL, and also has rice plate specials however I've yet to try them since their soups are so good.  Rose's serves quite a few varieties of noodle soups that aren't commonly served at most Vietnamese restaurants not just in the Portland area but all along the West Coast.  For instant the Cao Lau Noodles is something I've only noticed at 1 other restaurant and that was in Vancouver, BC.  I don't typically find that Rose's or HA serve the definitive version of the soups that have counterparts in Portland such as Pho Bo, Hu Tieu Nam Vang, Mi Quang, Bun Bo Hue, etc.  Lots of these soups can be found in other restaurants that are a notch or two better than Rose's and HA.  However what I love most about Rose's and HA is that they aren't afraid to serve less common soups and by rotating the soups daily, it forces you to go out of your comfort zone and not order Pho or Bun Bo Hue 100% of the time.  \\n\\nI've yet to see Bun Moc, Pepper Pork Ball soup at another Viet place before so I have nothing to compare it to, but it's damn good and satisfying. The Cao Lau is a pretty solid rendition but not as memorable as the version I've had in Canada.  However I do feel spoiled that we have a version here in Portland regardless.  \\n\\nI also love how the atmosphere resembles eating at your mom's or grandmas's house rather than eating in a restaurant and that sorta adds to the experience for me.

The salad was the same way A few shrimp and a small amount of lettuce. C'mon it's lettuce and dressing! But the taste was very good. My wife had the cheeseburger and fries. She said it was good but nothing special. \\n\\nFor desert we ordered the lava cake. The waitress told us that it was a good idea to order it upon ordering your meal as it is scratch made and takes about 30 minutes. It was really good. Probably the best we have ever had. The combination of the fresh cake, hot chocolate and ice cream made this a real treat. \\n\\nMy opinion is that the dinner menu here is much better than the lunch as it offers more choices as you would expect and the portions are more aligned with the price."},{"name":"Volante Farms","address":"292 Forest St","city":"Needham","stars":"3.5","text":"How can you go wrong with everything being so super fresh.

Not every restaurant has the capacity to cook their pizza at 900 Fahrenheit or higher in 60 to 90 seconds, which is how it is classically done. Additionally, not many pizza joints are using real Caputo flour imported from Southern Italy. But do you know who is? That's right, Via Napoli smack in the center of the Italian pavillion at Epcot!\\n\\nI regret not knowing that they have a pizza window where you can get the same deliciously snooty pizza that you can indoors, because I went inside just for pizza and ended up waiting an hour for it. However, it was a beautiful night and we were in no hurry. \\n\\nSadly we did not try anything else, other than imported Italian wine, which was incredible. When the pizza arrived, it was pretty magical. For you pizza connoisseurs out there, the crust had a beautiful char, a slightly chewy crumb, and yes, they use imported Marzano tomatoes. \\n\\nWe had a tiny problem with our server, who was very eager to correct me about how the Margherita pizza with added pepperoni was no different than their pepperoni cheese pizza. I'd like to inform you all that the difference is that Margherita has basil, and their cheese pepperoni does not. Silly argument, and while I don't always stick to \\"the customer is always right\\" idea, in this instance, I was, and why would he argue with me? \\n\\nWe will certainly be back, and next time, I'll probably just go to the window.

In love with the cherry & pistachio cake and the grapefruit tartlet with coconut cream on top. They had so much flavour and distinct aromas without being too heavy. I love their citrus scone as well. It comes warm, just has the right citrusy flavour and easily falls in your mouth. The stuffy hard scones are the worst so I definitely appreciated this one!

Their sourcing for the meats and cheeses is also on point.\\n\\nI found the portions and prices here to be reasonable at $95 a head for the quattro piatti (though I admit to having my NYC price goggles on). They also have a tasting menu for $130 with more courses and additions like truffles, but I personally think the quattro is a better experience if you're with a group as you're able to choose from each category rather than all being locked into the same meal.\\n\\nThe wine program is simply excellent. The list is encyclopedic but easy to navigate, though I prefer to put myself in the hands of their somms.

The front doors face east and just to the right(north) of the front door are THREE parking spaces for carry out plus 2 regular spaces.

There were a few good things though, the malay lamb stew and Durban style roast chicken. The service is impeccable, decor original and refreshing.

The male server (Michael) I believe was new to this location and was exceptionally helpful and apologetic to the foolery that was taking place right next to us. A staff member chose to re enter the building after seeing a guest that did not leave a great review come in to order. She began to yell insults at the women and completely belittle her. The server who did not disclose her name but had red dreads continued to treat the guest unfairly. The guest was super calm to start but as the server continued to disrespect her she began to get more and more aggravated. After calling the guest out of her name numerous times they then proceeded to gang up on the guest. A server and what seemed to be a training manager or head server yelled \\"get out my store we don't need to serve you.\\" Who does that? Why would you deny service to someone after your staff member decided to be utterly disrespectful. How could we enjoy our meal with her being so crazy. The server kept inviting the girl behind the counter to fight and the guest did not speak. The server began yelling \\"I don't need to work here my man take care of me, he in the car\\" she kept brining up something about a weapon. like are you completely insane ? I just don't understand why the escalation to weapons, why the disregard for the other guests in the establishment and why the supposed manager on duty did not handle the situation better. They all just sat there (with the exception of our male server) yelling at this women and her significant other.

The cuisine is global. There's a seasonal \\"Visa\\" menu that features several dishes from a certain country or region (e.g. Cuba, the Nordic) and a permanent \\"Resident\\" menu that features dishes which represent a wide variety of cuisines from Brazil to the Virgin Islands. The seasonal menu changes every 90 days. Tackling so many cooking styles is ambitious, but The Consulate pulls it off. The food we had was excellent.\\n\\nThe restaurant opened in June 2016 and is from the same husband-and-wife owners as Honey Bubble on Ponce De Leon. Mei Lin, who formulated all of the recipes at Honey Bubble, is the executive chef at The Consulate and her husband Doug Hines is the interior designer.\\n\\nOne of the most distinguishing characteristics of the restaurant is its design. Like Honey Bubble, Doug designed the interior of The Consulate. The design is very unique and original. The ambiance is unlike any other restaurant in Atlanta. One could describe it as having a classy, jet-setting, James Bond theme. There's a lot going on. It's an eclectic mix of fine furniture, art, and decor.\\n\\nThere are a variety of seating options from cozy, intimate, tucked-away booths to more open high-top tables near the bar where the action is. This is a great date spot and it's also a fun place to come with a group.\\n\\nAt first, I thought this might be one of those places where the atmosphere overshadows the food (style over substance), but luckily, that wasn't the case. The food really shined. During our visit, the seasonal menu was Ethiopian. Eight Ethiopian dishes were offered from key sir alicha salad (beet and potato salad, $9) to yekik alicha (yellow split pea stew, $11). As this is a tapas restaurant, most of the plates are small and designed for sharing. Prices ranged from $8-25 per plate. I suggest starting with two dishes per person.\\n\\nWe tried items from both the seasonal and permanent menus. They included:\\n\\nVisa menu:\\n* Doro wot ($15) - Ethiopian chicken stew, berbere spice, potatoes, soft boiled egg, onions, garlic, ginger\\n* Lamb tibs ($18) - dry saute with onions, rosemary, jalapenos, garlic, and ginger, served with injera bread\\n\\nResident menu:\\n* Pan-seared scallops ($22) - three Atlantic scallops, lemon capers, butter sauce, micro herbs\\n* Korean pulled duck confit ($17) - butternut squash, dried cranberries, garlic, scallions, Korean BBQ sauce, crostinis\\n* Havana egg roll ($11) - chef Mei's slow roasted pork, ham, Asiago cheese, house mustard, pickle spear\\n* Brussels sprouts ($8) - sauteed red onions, garlic, chives, Parmesan Reggiano\\n* Dry sauteed Thai okra ($8) - sea salt, cracked pepper, rosemary, olive oil, Thai chili sauce\\n* Octopus alla griglia ($14) - grilled octopus, sweet mango chili sauce\\n\\nAs you might expect, The Consulate's presentation of Ethiopian dishes was more beautiful than what you'd typically find at an Ethiopian restaurant. The doro wot was served in cast iron on a sturdy wooden board. The lamb tibs were placed atop a semi-unrolled piece of injera, garnished with a magenta flower and a sprig of rosemary. As for taste, the doro wot was fine. The chicken breast was a bit dry, but the flavor was there. While the lamb tibs could have been more flavorful, the quality of the meat was outstanding. I've never had lamb so consistently soft and tender. There was just a hint of gaminess to it. It was impressive.\\n\\nAll of the dishes we tried from the Resident menu were fantastic. In general, both the quality of the ingredients and the execution of the dishes were terrific. If I had to pick favorites, in order, they would be the pan-seared scallops, Korean pulled duck confit, and the dry sauteed Thai okra. These dishes were pretty much perfect. The scallops were fresh, buttery, and melt-in-your-mouth good. I loved the generous amount of capers. The Korean pulled duck confit was outstanding in both flavor and texture. I'm not sure exactly what made the dish \\"Korean,\\" because the flavors (hoisin sauce?) tasted more Chinese to me. The okra, served in whole pieces, wasn't overly slimy and had ideal firmness.\\n\\nThe octopus alla griglia was another awesome dish. The octopus was thick, meaty, and good quality. The meat was soft and not chewy nor rubbery. The Havana egg roll was a neat Cuban-Chinese fusion packed with plenty of pork and ham. One roll is quite filling. I liked the Parmesan and chives they added to the oily, garlicky Brussels sprouts.\\n\\nI haven't even mentioned the elaborate drink menu featuring \\"craft\\" cocktails. My girlfriend had an El Navegador ($12), a \\"Spanish-style\\" gin and tonic made with Bombay Sapphire, St. Germain elderflower, 18.21 tonic syrup, honey water, lime, and Earl Grey bitters. It was gorgeous and delicious. She loved it.\\n \\nService was top-notch.\\n\\nThe Consulate will validate parking for up to 3 hours in the 10 10th Street parking garage.

It's tucked away in a small plaza which might be hard to find if you've never been to Davis Square. (Me, prior to this visit.) But once you're there, you can open up the door to Sugidama and walk into a spacious, airy restaurant with a huge blue mural resembling Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa painting mixed with other Japanese motifs. \\n\\nThere is a sushi bar and a bar, but no alcohol as of yet. Two communal tables in the center and then about a dozen of smaller tables by the mural. Plenty of seating here but it seems to fill up quickly around 7pm on a weeknight. (And yay to not two but three restrooms!)\\n\\nMenu-wise, there are a lot of hot and cold soba options, which is really what they're known for. And because this is also an izakaya, there is yakitori aka heaven on a stick. My friend and I started off with the dashimaki tamago, which is the Japanese-style egg omelet with grated radish and dashi. The omelet \\n\\nWe ordered the shrimp and veggie tempura sobas, hers in cold and mine in hot. We decided to skip yakitori and sushi for the time being considering we came all the way to try their soba and it is a soba restaurant. (We did notice that everyone else around us was eating sushi though.)\\n\\nI don't have the perfect words to describe how delicious the hot soba was. It tasted unlike all the soba I've had before and I found out after that they make their own noodles. No wonder! So chewy and smooth. The broth tastes similar to the dipping sauce for cold soba but obviously hot and not as strong. I'm over the moon for this hot soba. \\n\\nTempura was also fried to perfection. You get two shrimp ones and a handful of veggies. I took my first bite of the shrimp and was momentarily transported to the restaurant tucked inside an unassuming building in Shinjuku where I had my first real taste of tempura.

I made it real easy for him by ordering margarita pitchers, water, chips, salsa, queso, guacamole, and a sample plate for each table. PRO TIP- ask for the unadvertised free \\"Sample plate\\". It has the meats, salsa's, and sauces. Such a good idea Chile Verde. Good for you. Now helping to keep dirty dishes pushed down to where Tom could clear them, along with keeping glasses full , made it go smoother. They served our own birthday cake. Tom also took individual orders and boxed leftovers.\\n\\nI do wish the flat screen TV could have volume to hear.

Most of their dishes cost less than $7 so you can order a variety of things and still keep your tab relatively low. My favorites are the chili chicken, samosas, butter chicken, and the raita. The chili chicken is crispy and juicy, served with their tamarind sauce and some kind of yogurt sauce? The samosas are loaded with vegetables and served with the same sauce as the chili chicken. My favorite part about the butter chicken is seeing a pat of butter melting in between the shredded chicken and delicious butter sauce. I always get a side of raita to cut the richness and fattiness of the other dishes. Delishhhhh. \\n\\nI got the vegetable biryani this time around but it was really salty.

My dad got the citizen burger with the tumbleweed fries, which were fried zucchini and squash strings! The burger was a bit dry but not bad.

We ordered the roast beef sandwich and carved turkey sandwich, each came with a side of fries and a dessert. We had a masters cupcake (which is topped with the infamous \\"grey stuff\\") and the chocolate cream puff. \\n\\nThe food arrives at your table and you do not have to wait for it, which really sets this quick service option apart from the rest of the options.

But like a phoenix rises from the ashes, one of my favorite local grocery stores in Portland has opened an outpost in it's place, and man oh man is it good. The folks behind Barbur World Foods, a fantastic Lebanese market out in SW, have brought their excellent deli, cheese, beer, wine and product selections to the core of the city. Now I don't have to drive all the way out to SW PDX to score tasty treats. \\n\\nIn my mind the star of the show here is the deli, with a variety of prepared foods from hummus and baba to kibbeh, hand-pies and more. There's a hot case with braised lamb and all sorts of delectable goodies. And the house-made pita is fan-freakin-tastic. For those not familiar with Lebanese fare, head on over and sample from the case. For those who are in to it, you'll know - this is some bomb stuff... especially for a prepared foods case. \\n\\nAnyone who has been to the Barbur store in recent years knows how much they have elevated their game out there when it comes to beer selection, wines, and groceries. The offerings run deep. And they have brought that careful curation to this new location. Everything is shiny and new. And it's not just all middle-eastern stuff. Need some Marmite? They have it. And tons of other things. for the size of the store, they sure have packed a lot in. \\n\\nThey've also kept the juice bar and wine counter that Local Choice installed, and while the products may be different, there's still a place to sit and have a glass of wine, and the walk-up bar in the front. Gone is the large area for sitting and eating, which is definitely a loss, but they maximized the space and have put a fully stocked grocery in. This is not a convenience store, it's more like a gourmet market with a lot of international flair. Nothing else like it in the area. \\n\\nI'll miss the very produce-heavy selection of Local Choice, but that doesn't change how I feel about having my delicious deli loves so close at hand."},{"name":"Bickford's Family Restaurant","address":"770 Gallivan Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"3","text":"Some chains just deserve their own review, and this is definately one of them.

I'd ask to go easy on the egg (they may put a bit too much, which makes it taste a bit eggy, in my opinion). \\n\\nLunch special comes with the salad bar, which features a nice, homemade peanut dressing.  I think this is the best value; if you want to try it, go during lunch. \\n\\nDinner portion is slightly bigger (same as take-out).  As for the take-out, items are left unassembled (as they should be), until you take it home and mix it in, as preferred. \\n\\nI'll become, \\"Yay! I'm a fan\\" when they improve their curries. Lacking a dimension of acid (citrus), and mine tasted a bit burnt.

We live in the are an would love to have something in walking distance that has good food. The Kenton Club is great for drinks, but a good pub is definitely needed. We have now been to North End 3 times, in a very concerted effort to give them a chance. I will say that we had pizza last time we were there and it was definitely tasty, a marked improvement from the last time we went and the food was bland and took forever to cook. \\n\\nWe drive by here every day, and with the signs about pool, fooosball etc we decided to give it one more try. Look, I have no clue how to operate a food establishment, but I do know retail and small business and these guys need to read these reviews and take them to heart. The food seems to be good now, so what needs attention, and lots of it, is the atmosphere. When we were there they had golf up on the projector, the jukebox was off and they had some local radio playing...come on, no one wants to hear radio ads while eating. There are in fact some quick and easy tricks to giving a place personality, even one of this size, which seems to be part of the challenge. \\n\\nThey are apparently brewing their own beer...also a tremendous challenge. That said, they should  NOT shy away from serving local beers! Everyone wants to stand out from the crowd, but they need to look at what other pubs are doing successfully and implement that in their own place! \\n\\nLook, it is a huge risk and an unbelievable amount of work to start any business, and supposedly way worse in the food/drink industry. If I had been treated badly or thought these guys weren't trying at all, I could care less if they failed. I think they do want to get it right, this may be a dream for the guys who own it, so I really want them to get it together and succeed. Maybe they can pull together a group of us Yelpers from those who WANT them to succeed and we can give them some good feedback......hint, hint, hint....\\n\\nIn summary, I think the food has improved and you'll get a decent meal here. The atmosphere needs A LOT of work...so if you are feeling up to it, swing by and have some pizza and beer and have the cajones I seem to lack and tell them right then and there what you think.

It was so crowded I had to sit at the bar. Problem number one. It's not a real bar!  It's just a counter. If you put your legs in front of you you hit a wall and are very far from the counter. So I had to sit with my legs spread to get anywhere near the counter!  \\nWhat's worse is while I was in line at the buffet someone took my spot at the counter and so I had to move.

What a line!Took 8 min for me to get to food. They had mango ice cream, oranges, several chutneys on the cold bar. On the hot bar there was rice which I was scraping the bottom of both times I went up. There was vegetable curry. Paneer, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, and goat. I felt like compared to all the places I've been this selection was limited. The Indian buffet options on I drive alone put this place to shame!  The only thing I was eating here was tandoori chicken. Where was my lamb dish?  \\nThe tandoori chicken was fine. It wasn't bad, but not great either. I've never been to an Indian restaurant and not drank at least two glasses of water.  Indian food in my experience is spicy and I like that!  I drank half a glass of water. Not remotely spicy. The ice cream was also no good. It had been frozen, thawed, and frozen again. It was filled with ice crystals. \\nAll I can figure is that the east side is starved for good Indian restaurants and people have not experienced the glorious options on the southwest side.

The woman behind the counter asked me if I wanted to eat...something about \\"ask a stupid question\\" came to mind.  \\n\\nI told her we were going to eat outside since we had our dog with us and she replied that it would probably take her 5 minutes to get out there and clear the table.

It was 15 minutes before the original dirty table was bussed. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the bacon tacos, and neither of us could barely find, let alone taste, a hint of bacon in the tacos.

I had the Bo Beau special and my breakfast was OK, certainly not 4 star worthy in the slightest.

The Trevi is the new guy on the block and has been here for 5 weeks.\\n\\nIf you drink coffee the way I do... I'm a coffee cretin...you would dump one Splenda(tm) and a Buttload of half and half into what is essentially brown burnt water...any brown burnt water will do as long as the fumes of Splenda and Cream are just right...right enough to mask the flavor of the burnt water.\\n\\nAll this talk that goes on about the coffee at Starbucks, DD, The Atomic, etc. is all very interesting and in my mind similar to the talk from people who argue about the differences of the product you get when you ferment potatoes. (Vodka) I find it amusing because there really is no difference in the end result for either Vodka or Coffee.  No matter how you roast, age, grind, and enhance with flavor a coffee bean, the end result is going to be a bitter, brown water that is begging for the natural enhancement that only Splenda(tm) and Moo Juice will give it.\\n\\nBut back to Trevi....\\n\\nThe owners have done a remarkable job with the space they chose... It really is a warm, inviting atmosphere with all sorts of Euro Flair and tasteful choices in how they present their product.  The array of cool creamy gooey cakes looked great and the gellato was as colorful as a Carnival parade in Rio.  The coffee smelled wonderful and the piped in music was soothing and quick to get under the skin and straight to the inner ear.  While I sat I heard, Frank, Bobby Darin, Jo Stafford, and Lena Horne, all long forgotten artists who are missed.\\n\\nI had a regular coffee and did my usual abortion to the brown water, and had a very chocolate muffin with it.  Both items were great, and coupled with the fine atmosphere this made the short trip well worth it.\\n\\nSo my next question is this... There are so many coffee shops in one little area...somethings gotta give in my opinion.  I think one of the five businesses that I mentioned in the top of this review will be gone within a year....

We hadn't been seated more than 10 minutes when she came by to tell us our table was ready.\\n\\nThe restaurant was a little noisy, but that's just because it was packed.  People clearly enjoy this place.  There are lots of cute decorations and candle holders--the kind of place that just screams \\"Pinterest\\" when you walk in the door, but in a good way.  Which is rare.    \\n\\nOnce at our table, our waitress came by and took our coupon and explained thoroughly what we'd get.  Two glasses of wine, a shared appetizer, two salads, two entrees, a shared dessert.  I was dying for the Lazy Magnolia nut brown, but chose a glass of sparkling wine instead, which was good.  He had a glass of the pinot noir, which was stellar.  Here's the breakdown of our meal:\\n\\nAppetizer:  Hot coconut braised mussels-  Basically mussels and sourdough bread floating in the most amazing coconut broth...  This was one of those times that we took a bite, then stared at each other with wide eyes, as it was so above and beyond our expectations. \\n\\nSalads:  arugula, shaved fennel, humboldt fog, cider vinagrette-  We throughly enjoyed the salad, the dressing was awesome, but I thought that my humboldt fog may have actually been just a plain jane blue cheese.  We had humboldt fog last week and it was a bit different than what was on my salad.  Then again, every batch of cheese is a tad different, I suppose.\\n\\nEntrees:  I had the wild mushroom ravioli.  It was beyond amazing...  The pasta was tender, the filling flavorful, the broccoli rapini had the perfect bite, and it was so well seasoned that I never touched the salt and pepper.  In fact, we never touched them the whole meal.  He had the pepper-seared beef tenderloin, which he raved about incessantly, even long after the meal.  \\"Love the way they crusted the peppers on the outside,\\" he says.  \\"Good beef!\\"  \\n\\nDessert:  Our ears perked at the creme brulee on the menu, but when I heard it was melon flavored, I suddenly had doubts.  We went for it anyhow, and it was so perfect...the top was sweet and perfectly torched, the inside cool and creamy.  The slightest hint of melon.  So good.  \\n\\nOverall, there were a couple tiny things that weren't perfect:  the bathroom had no paper towels, so we wiped our hands on our jeans.  The sauce that came with the beef tenderloin was so good, he wished he'd had enough to put on his fries as well, or that there was a ketchup or barbecue sauce that paired with it--we probably could've asked, but we were busy devouring.

Sure, this sounds obvious, but generally when someone says that a place is \\"soooo good\\", I have to try it.\\n\\nInitially I visted Golden Temple's website, and I was taken by how beautiful the place looked. Finally, after a year of waiting, I went on Sunday night on a double date, and I was super-excited to get some of that fresh delicious food in my tum-tum (that's slang for \\"tummy\\"). Sure enough, when we arrived the decor was pretty sweet, but not as amazing as I remembered from the site (that's probably just me being an idiot, so no points off there). When we were seated I noticed that it was a lot more casual that how it looks from the outside and the site; we were seated next to a couple and their ugly kids, all of  whom were dressed casually. \\n\\nOur waiter was this cool old Chinese man (that my date later high-fived for his awesomeness). He was very attentive to our table. We started off with a couple of scorpion bowls for two. They were LOADED up with booze, but I was looking forward to drinking the flaming 151 in the center, and there WAS no center! Just boozy, boozy juice. Then we got a few appetizers - chicken fingers (fine), seaweed salad (really good), and salt and pepper calamari (a little disappointing). My date and I split the Beef, Spicy Hot, which was not spicy at all. In fact, it tasted like hot and sour soup (not a bad flavor, but perplexing to say the least). We had to order a bowl of hot sauce to get the heat going a little bit.\\n\\nYou can tell if you're not wowed by a restaurant if you keep comparing it to other restaurants the entire time you're there. In fact, for the duration of the dub-d (that's what I'm calling the double date now because I'm lazy), I was dreaming of Chau Chow City. The reason I demanded we get the salt and pepper calamari (with a bang of my fist on the table) is because the calamari at CCC was so unbelievable and I really wanted that again. I know now that it will be only a short while before I hit up that Chinatown spot for some sweet sweet Chinese food.\\n\\nSo, if you're in Brookline, and you like slightly-overpriced/average-tasting Chinese food, go to Golden Temple - you won't be disappointed! If you have higher standards and just want some bomb Asian food, go to New Rod Dee down the street for the best Thai on the C line."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is the best steak I've had in the past ten years. \\n\\nI had a New York strip prepared Pittsburgh Rare.

Not only do they offer a HUGE selection of gluten free meals, they also use lighter and healthier ingredients than what you typically think of for an american chinese food restaurant. Another fact to note: this restaurant is mostly dairy free and very accommodating for any food allergies.  They do not have a separate gluten free menu to hand out but I have adjusted meals like Lo Mein to be made with one of their rice noodle substitutions like Vermicelli.  Although they do not offer gluten free fortune cookies, all of their rices, meats, and even noodle dishes are gluten free friendly.  Aside from some obviously battered dishes like General Gau's Chicken and Sesame Chicken, as long as you let your waiter know you are gluten free they will make a note to the chef and accommodate you.  All of the staff I have spoken too either know right away whether something can be made gluten free friendly or not or will run to the back to ask the chef.  I've tried Chow Mein, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken and Broccoli, Kung Pao Chicken, Moo Shi Chicken (without the mandarin pancakes), and Vegetable Vermicelli. I must have dug in too fast to snap a photo, but trust me this food looks and tastes delicious! \\n\\nThey also offer online ordering and delivery through Grub Hub.\\n\\nThis is also a fun place to share meals with friends.  Because the portions are large, you can get a few items and split them for the table.  If you go to a late dinner, stick around!

But unfortunately once was enough.\\nWhen my wife booked our reservations, (I believe it was 5-6 weeks in advance) she told them that we were celebrating our anniversary.\\nWe arrived to the restaraunt an hour early and had a drink at the bar. So, the first complaint that I have is that the \\"well drink\\" cost $11.50. It was quite a mark up.\\nWhen we were taken to our table we were put in the room where the windows were but we were sitting next to the wall. I guess that we should have asked for a different table, however I thought that being secluded might have its advantages because we would not be in the noisy part of the restaraunt. But the problem with sitting over there is that we were ignored.\\nWe started our meal with the salad bar and I will say that, that was excellent. The best salad bar that I have ever been to, and that would be great if that was the only reason that we were going. But after visiting the salad bar, our experience went downhill.\\nI don't know the reason why we got such bad service, but I would guess that it could be because we only ordered water to drink. It is my belief that the server viewed us as bad tippers since we weren't spending much more than the cost of dinner, and therefore he didn't try very hard to serve us. He was right about the poor tip.\\nI loved the way they brought around the meat on the skewers. We never had to wait very long for a selection to be brought to our table. The problem was that the quality was not good. The Filet was the worst that we ever had, it was extremely tough and Filets should not be overcooked. But the highlight of the meats were the lamb chops. Those practically melted in our mouths.\\nPart of the poor service is that our server never checked on us. \\nOne thing that I noticed is that when a customer left they had the table cleared and another customer sitting there within 4 or 5 minutes. That is a good thing, however I also got the feeling that another reason why we were being ignored was because they wanted to turn our table over. Maybe make room for a higher paying customer.\\nWhen we went to the salad bar, we returned to find that our dirty dishes were still on our table. We had to bus our own table so that we could have a place to eat. \\nWhen we were done with our water, we waited for our server to come back to our table. We noticed other people getting refills on water, but not us. We were almost  ready to leave when our server walked by our table with the water, we didn't say anything, but I looked at my empty glass and he came over and refilled it. My wife said \\"finally, I thought that you fhad forgotten about us\\". He smiled, but didn't say anything and walked away.\\nOur anniversary was not recognized either.\\nWe gave him a 10% tip, and that was mainly because the salad bar was excellent. But at $49.95 per person, it would not be worth dining there just for the salad bar.\\nWhen we left, my wife asked the hostess if they generally do something for anniversaries, and she said \\"yes, wasn't anything done for you?\\", and my wife said \\"no, but that was the least of it.\\"\\nWe won't be going back. \\nThe lowest review that I could give is one star, but I think that there should be a zero star category, because I want to give them a one based on the salad bar, but it will have to be a 2, however it doesn't reflect my disapointment accurately."},{"name":"Cambridge Coffee Shop","address":"847 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2","text":"We get breakfast from here all the time.

I was a little worried I wasn't going to have enough money for the $10 po' boy, and it was a little obvious as I went to the side to count my pennies.  However, the owner really wanted me to savor the experience, so he did all he could to make sure I got to try one of his po' boys, even if it meant footing some of the bill.  I was a little shocked.  I ended up scraping together enough money for my lunch and a measly tip, so he instructed me to grab a drink of my choice, on him.

So, if you are looking for a kick ass, pretty cheap burrito or nachos, go here! It may be a chain, but it is a great, great place to eat!

I was excited for a great steak aged and fire grilled.   Price wise I think the price is fair $32 for a Kansas City 20 oz steak including a house salad.   However a few things disappointed me.   First the booths are very uncomfortable both in height for the person I was with who is short and width making it a tight squeeze.   We moved to a table but the chairs were not that comfortable either.  But that is a minor point.   The waiter was very nice.  I feel the wait staff is very skilled but two things ticked me off.   1 the waiter forgot to bring the garlic bread over until we asked.  Why I do not know as the restaurant was not at all busy and two he asked if I wanted peppercorn butter on my steak.  I didn't know if I would want that so I said put it on the side.   When I received my bill I noticed I was charged $6 for this little pat of butter on the side.  Really didn't even use it.   Now I could care less for trying to pad my bill or forgetting bread but let's get to the meat of the review.  The steak itself.  An excellent piece that was not trimmed properly but was cooked perfectly a plus.   However to my taste the wood pit left a unique flavor that I know some people would love but I was not one of those.  I thought the smokiness of the wood ruined the steak.  So I give the restaurant a three but was disappointed because it could have been a five.   Also while the house salad was served on a perfectly chilled metal plate the waiter never offered fresh pepper instead there is cheap salt pepper shakers on the table.  That's a shame a high end steakhouse should have high end salt and pepper shakers.  Just fell short.

What we received for nearly 100 per person was quite simple a catastrophe of boggled execution at most every step and by nearly the entire staff. With poor service and some nearly inedible dishes, I left deeply displeased\\n\\nThe food: \\n\\nCourse one: A shrimp and radish salad garnished with cornbread crumble. Harshly acidic vinegarette and room temperature seafood. I'll pass.\\n\\nCourse two: Broccoli & Cheese Risotto with Cheddar toast. In hindsight, should have consumed more helpings as it was one of the last edible experiences of the evening.\\n\\nCourse three: Smoked White Fish Spread with butter guzzled toast points. Imagine a fast food fish filet sandwich, blended in hot butter and a handful of salt then slathered on buttered toast. The texture, taste and smell was akin to biological warfare.\\n\\nCourse four: Cod and Sausage Stew. My working theory is they received their steamed cod from the dry cleaner next door. The sausage tasted like nothing but smoke and crumbled albeit intriguing way for something stewed. All in all, this dish was an episode of the XFiles.\\n\\nLet us pause for no less than 30 minutes with not a waiter to be found while waiting on the supposedly amazing main courses. \\n\\nCourse five: It came. I'm ravenous. It's Short Rib in a Cranberry Sauce. All in all an averagely prepared dish no better than the inside of a upscale street taco. \\n\\nCourse six: Blood Sausage: I love blood sausage. It's fatty, irony flavor hard seared with star anise and other spices is like a fine wine for carnivores. But without a doubt, this particular blood sausage was one of the worst bites that I have ever had the unpleasant fortune to take. Inside meat was an unidentifiable undercooked grain that was *CHEWY. I literally just shuttered at the thought of his texture like nails on a chalkboard. With an overbearing salty quality and unformed fatty yet grain texture, it was almost criminal. I cannot express hatred hard enough for this particular dish. \\n\\nCourse seven: Pork Belly. I imagine this is an every night ingredient and it should be right? Pork belly might be the greatest gift that the universe bestowed upon humanity. Served with creamy, buttery mashed potatoes and sweet and salty peppers! How could this get any better? Considering my most aggressive hunger pains at this point in the meal, I was ready to be delighted with both an experience but would settle for edible nourishment. And that's exactly what this dish was. Settling. It was the tinder date of pork belly. It was the beer goggles (or in this case, hunger goggles) of the evening. It was fine. It could be eaten. And it was.\\n\\nDessert: Amazing.\\n\\nThis pastry chef should own the restaurant. This pastry chef is a god among man. This pasty chef was over the top good.\\n\\nCourse Eight: Pumpkin cake with Pumpkin Pie Filling, Caramel Ice Cream and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds. I could have had ten plates (not just because I was hungry but because I was in love). I want to Netflix and Chill this dish.\\n\\nCourse Nine: Banana Pudding with Meringue. Simple. Beautiful. Superb.\\n\\nQuite simply, the pastry chef is too good for this restaurant. Perhaps, too good for us humans.\\n\\nCocktails:\\n\\nThey were fine. Nothing special to see here. Oh wait, they were $17? Do you want me to compare you to Tom's masterpieces at Prohibition? I think not.\\n\\nWine and Beer:\\n\\nPretty horrendous selection with no real character. One of their 10 beers was Budweiser. Price as marked: $5. I got a $7 Sierra Nevada. Again nothing special but the price.\\n\\nWe had a couple of wines. An average Pinot Nior and an I drinkable Riesling. \\n\\nThe service:\\n\\n\\n\\nThis needs to be discussed. If you want a fine dining experience where they treat you like a bartender at a packed college bar, go here. \\n\\nIf you like to walk into a place and be treated like, \\"oh you should just feel grateful that you could eat at our establishment\\" with upturned, pierced noses, this is the place for you.\\n\\nThe hostesses were smug hipsters with delusions of aristocratic social statuses.  \\n\\nSupposedly, the \\"Chefs\\" are supposed to describe their dishes. Ours simple through down plates and mumbled unclearly while looking over their shoulder, then disappeared into the ether. \\n\\nOur waiter was impolite. He made no recommendations. Didn't even bother coming around during our 30 minute wait between courses. Didn't offer coffee before desserts. Just poor training all around. \\n\\nThe only descent humans we discovered on this remote outpost was our Second course Chef and of course, the pastry chef.\\n\\n\\nOverall: After that experience and paying a $180 per couple tab, I'm left troubled, nearly traumatized. This experience was scarring as if I just got mugged. It makes me question everything about this culinary movement south of town.

Our server was attentive and made excellent suggestions, even pulling over the bartender to show us how their Fall Old Fashioned was made--they light the thing on fire which makes it smoky and delicious.\\n\\nOr maybe the icing on the cake was the cake itself? They brought it out to slice it and it was bigger than my head, with a generous slice as a dessert portion.\\n\\nWith the closing of my beloved Vox Table, I needed a new date night restaurant.

I strongly suggest making your reservation at least 1 week in advance.  They offer seatings at several different times so it's not the type of restaurant you can walk-in and expect to get a table.(unless you get super lucky!) The menu varies from night to night so if you're looking for the menu online and can't find it, don't get frustrated. It's because they change dishes weekly & depending on the dish it could change nightly. Not being able to see a set menu may turn some people off but don't let it! The chefs at this restaurant I feel are some of the best in ATL. Gunshow offers a very unique dining experience. Once seated you're greeted by your waiter who keeps your drinks filled and prepares/serves you your custom cocktails at your table off a rolling cart. Then out come the chefs to your table to present their dishes to you & you can either accept it or kindly deny it. If it's denied, no worries they simply mark it off your menu and they don't bring it back by. The portions are a little on the small side (depending) so for parties of 4 or more I'd recommend two of the same dish for the table. By the end of dinner our tab came out to be about $350 for the four of us. Each of us had 2 cocktails a piece and tried almost every small dish they offered. Yes, $350 is a lot for a meal but it was well worth it. The dishes are fresh, unique and absolutely mouthwatering!

We had heard the hype about it and had previously dined at Woodfire Grill, so we were looking forward to trying this dim sum style restaurant. \\n\\nWe had a group of 3 and were the first to be seated when the doors opened at 6:00. Our waiter came over and explained the menu to us, then had the cocktail cart come over to serve us. I had the toasted old fashioned and it was delicious. The gin and tonic was excellent as well, but we also had a lighter cocktail with watermelon flavoring that had no taste whatsoever. The \\"pig and fig\\" was also not the favorite of the group, having a smokey, ham-like aftertaste. We had to dilute it with water to be able to drink it. \\n\\nSoon after we got our cocktails the dishes started coming. You feel bad when you decline the meals and you have the chef who prepared it offering it to you. But some of the choices are definitely for a certain kind of diner and I'm just not that kind of person. \\n\\nThe restaurant uses paper menus and tally marks to keep track of what dishes you chose to eat and which ones you passed on. This method is also used for drinks and desserts, with the restaurant adding a tally next to every dish or drink you order and then calculating your final bill based on the dishes you consumed. \\n\\nAs the restaurant gets more crowded, the meal offerings come out slower and slower. If you're the first person to arrive, you get a lot of good food right away, and then there's a couple of lulls while the chefs are preparing their first courses for the other patrons who came in later and haven't tried their initial offering yet. \\n\\nThe food was phenomenal though. The menu changes so not all the foods we enjoyed will be around again, but we enjoyed beef short rib, flank steak, spicy clams, scallops, arugula and ham salad, and some amazing garnishes and finishing sides. My favorite was the pork shoulder and crispy Okra fries. I wish I had a giant platter of that alone.  \\n\\nFor dessert we enjoyed the \\"rock road\\" with caramel foam, a house made toasted marshmallow, chocolate gelato, and waffle pieces. We would have licked the plate if there had been fewer people sitting around us.\\n\\nMy one big complaint is we had a few things added on to our bill that weren't even marked on our menu as having being ordered. We were overcharged on some drinks that were tallyed incorrectly. I'm also guessing that they forgot to charge some other group for a drink and decided to slip it on to ours thinking we wouldn't notice, but having a beer pop up on your bill when it wasn't even marked on the paper menu they tally your total cost on doesn't make a lot of sense. Granted it was $5 and we had already paid so we didn't say anything, but I would pay much more attention to my bill next time.\\n\\nOverall, I would come back if there was a friend or relative visiting who specifically requested to visit this restaurant, but I'm too impatient, too picky, and too poor to make this a regular visit."},{"name":"Cannoli's Restaurant","address":"920 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"3","text":"Not a place I'd  go back to unless close by.

My chums and I love slumming it with the locals. It's become a weekly tradition with us to take my friend Farnsworth's yacht out in Marblehead, peel off our official Harvard Polo Club shirts, pile in my Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, head back down to campus and get some authentic Bostonian food like chicken kabobs and pulled pork sandwiches. Their prices are very reasonable, which is great since I live on a limited weekly stipend sent over from my dad in San Fran (my trust fund doesn't kick in until I'm 25 - one more year to go! To be fair, I won't even need it once I graduate with my PhD in race relations). Admittedly the food is kind of mediocre, but where else in the Boston area can you get a cheeseburger for ONLY NINE BUCKS???? They also have an exotic beer selection, like Sam's Seasonal and Stella Artois.\\n\\nIt's really divey and quirky, which is great because I only like drinking in places where I can't see my own hand a foot in front of my face. Even the service is divey: me and my girlfriend were the only customers there one Monday afternoon, and we got the check twenty minutes after we finished our meal! I LOVE shitty service, it really adds character. Everyone here is really sassy too, especially the 30-something blond bartender with tacky tattoos. There's nothing better than being condescended to by an art school dropout who lives in a studio apartment.\\n\\nSometimes, in the warm weather, me and my buddy Alfred R. like to hang out in the biergarten and discuss politics. What really sells Charlie's for me though is the staff and clientele. Everyone is so arty and mysterious! In fact, I even overheard one of the bartenders say her new year's resolution was to \\"make more art.\\" SOOO cool! Hopefully one day we can get married and move down to Williamsburg together. Their jukebox is great, too. You can spot me there any night of the week, leaning against it nonchalantly in my chucks and Rivers Cuomo glasses, playing really really obscure music like Animal Collective and Dropkick Murphys (Boston pride!!!)."},{"name":"Grand Central Baking Company","address":"1444 NE Weidler","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wandering out of Sullivan's Gulch to get a feel for our new neighborhood the search started with the basic needs for wireless and coffee. \\n\\nThere is nothing worse than moving to a new spot without the coffee machine unpacked or internet hooked up yet.\\n\\nGrand Central filled the bill nicely.

They sure as hell didn't check mine.\\n\\nWe went late, and just for drinks.  It was a strange experience.  The bar is neato looking, and behind it is a DJ booth taking up the middle of the room.  (The DJ, by the way, was a little too creative.  He mixed Beastie Boys with AC/DC.  I couldn't quite get into it.)  Below, there is a dance floor surrounded by tables, like the last wedding you went to.  The ceiling over the lower part of the room is just WEIRD: it's got these pulsating red circles, and we were trying to decide whether it was more like being inside a cocoon or a human heart.  Either way, it was disconcerting.  \\n\\nThen, there's the crowd.  There were lots of college-age women that were incredibly overdressed, college-aged men that were incredibly under dressed, some middle-aged men in suits, and lots of people in their mid-30s who liked like they had gotten a babysitter for the night and were ready to have some fun.  My hunch is that the college girls go there looking for rich middle-aged men, and the college boys go there looking for the college girls.  The rich middle-aged men, obviously, are drawn there by some unexplained force of nature.  And the people in their 30s go there because they feel comfortable dancing in front of all the weirdos.  \\n\\nIt was just a strange experience.

It was supposed to be Italian dressing, but even after stirring it up a bit, it tasted very bland.

I am completely over the \\"Pets as Children\\" thing. Leave your dog at home where it belongs and keep it away from anywhere I eat. You may love your dog but I, do not. I find it hard to believe everyone thinks they have food allergies and celiac disease, but they feel entitled to bring their pets everywhere they go.\\n\\n2. It is not the job of every restaurant to make a place for your children. I love children, have two of my own, but I don't expect playsets and crayons everywhere I go. Doc Chey's is 30 yards away, and they love children. And oh, yes, this isn't a restaurant at all. It's a bar.\\n\\nAs I understand it, and Ron \\"The Angry Chef\\" has stated many times, The Family Dog is a bar. Let there be no confusion, your children will be welcomed here only slightly more warmly than at the Vortex.  I think they should add \\"Tavern\\" to the name, or just \\"Bar\\". This isn't because anyone dislikes children, but more more from shock. I don't take my kids to The Dark Horse, I won't take them to The Family Dog.\\n\\nThe seating is close but much more spread out than other area bars. This is nice because it is a bar, and someone may be having an obnoxious conversation nearby. Unlike others, I had no trouble understanding the \\"find a seat\\" method of finding a seat. Again, Bar, not restauarant. When was the last time you were seated at a bar?\\n\\nThe design of the entire establishment may be the finest example of faux old bar look in the southeast. Recovered wood, hand made bar, subway tile; It is genuinely a thing of beauty. They spent more on the decor than they had to, but I for one certainly appreciate the effort. It feels like a place that's been there for years. Without the soured beer towel smell. Win!\\n\\nThe snacks are great, if not salty by design. The pork rind Cheeto's are really nice, as are the duck fat chips. The chopped liver is not as good as the now defunct Shaun's, but any port in a storm and it's pretty close.The hot dogs are great when it's hot dog time. I'm not sure if these are on the menu all the time yet, but they should be. They also have frequent specials that you can stay updated on if you put Ron on twitter.\\n\\nOverall I'm very pleased with the joint. My default joints all allow smoking, but I'll certainly go here when I'm with a non-smoking crowd."},{"name":"Rosa's Pizza","address":"62 Broad St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Rosa's a great place to stop in for lunch.

I only had a bite of the panini (which BF said was a bit greasy) but I think I actually preferred it to my dish. Here's why...The hangover is really hard to eat without deconstructing it. It's stacked up pretty high, but the cheddar cheese in the middle got super tough and impossible to cut. It kind of covered up and ruined the biscuit for me. This isn't a dish you can really be dainty with (if you care about such things). The cheese on the smothered potatoes, tasty for the first couple bites, got similarly cold and tough within a minute or two. \\n\\nI might come back and try some other dishes at some point, but after hearing so many good things, I was expecting a little more out of the food.

We had to call servers for refilling water or for drinks, they were not very attentive. And boy, appetizers came some 50 minutes after we ordered. We didn't appreciate that. Later when we received the check, they have charged extra for two items which was supposed to be part of our deal. When asked, we were told lamb racks were premium items and isn't part of Groupon deal - we immediately pulled out fine print of the deal and asked where it was mentioned. They were speechless for a minute then the manager (also co-owner) was called, who talked for 20 minutes (albeit, politely) and refused to honor the deal. At the end we paid the extra but called Groupon who promptly apologized for our experience and refunded whole deal price. Instead of haggling with us for 20 minutes manager could have just honored the deal - not a good way to earn customer's trust. \\n\\nThat's a shame because food here in Park's edge is good - really, really good.  We just didn't feel like service justified the premium price.

The biscuits we started out with were incredibly buttery and thereby incredibly good. After asking the waiter's recommendation I went with the shrimp and grits and was seriously unimpressed with the portion size. There were 4 shrimp on my plate arranged on a ladle-full of grits: definitely not worth the $15 price tag. The taste was alright, far from the best shrimp and grits I've had in the city.

I jut asked for an empty soup bowl on the side and drained the juice out before puncturing my eggs. And really, the only reason I did that was because I'm not supposed to have gluten (they're braised with beer).
