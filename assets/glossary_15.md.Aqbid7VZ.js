Two other couples come in behind us, and the two chatty hostesses also tell them 10 minutes. No one is bussing the dirty tables, and the hostesses continue to chat away. 10 minutes pass and all three couples get sat at the same time, at tables that have been open and clean since we all entered the restaurant. It takes 15 minutes to order drinks, an additional 20 to order dinner, and 30 minutes after that to actually get our dinners.  The food was actually pretty good and very fresh. We had the table side guacamole which was very good but not quite worth the $11.

It's was very flavorful and izakaya sized so the $12 price was definitely worth it.

I needed my Pho fix.\\nLast week when I saw them pop  up on Scout mob I was pretty excited and  Co'm went to the top of my must try list.  Actually, I was a little  hesitant to try Co'm because some of the reviews were not that great from the people on yelp I tend to agree with.Yesterday, one of my favorite colleagues suggested we go to lunch and she has never eaten Vietnamese food so I thought  it was perfect time to pop the cherry!  \\nCo'm Dunwoody Grill is in the back of a shopping center behind the Old Hickory House.  They have a cute patio out front and the interior is really cute and much more upscale than any Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to.  The prices commensurate with the decor.  It's about  thirty percent more than I am used to paying for similar.  I ordered the beef noodles with a lamb spring roll.  Co'm gives you a choice of vegetarian, lamb, shrimp, tilapia, beef, and pork.   The price point  is about  $10-13 per person for lunch.  The pho was incredible . Co'm uses chicken broth instead of beef.    I could taste the cinnamon, cardamom, and anise.  I adored the broth and the beef was tender.  On the side they give you a bit of hoisin and sriracha sauce. All of the traditional fixings were there too. (Cilantro, bean sprouts, Mint, lime)  My colleague got the chicken pho and she enjoyed her as well.  The lamb spring roll was a little oily.  They fried the lamb instead of grilling it so when I took a bite I could see oil dripping out a bit. It wasn't bad but next time I'll get the shrimp. The spring rolls are just lettuce and meat. It was a tad uneventful.  This place doesn't serve traditional Vietnamese cuisine but nevertheless the flavors in the pho are rock star!  I give Co'ms version of Pho 5 stars and the spring rolls 2.5.  Now, onto the service. It is quite slow and I would not recommend going here if you have a strict lunch hour.  We were there for an hour and half and I had to waive the waiter over to get the check.  He was a nice guy but super slow.  Definitely come here when you are not in a rush.  The food took about 20 minutes to come out. It is a long time when you have to get back to work. Thankfully, we were not in a huge rush.

Contrary to the comments by Charles Y., I've never had any bad service there (and no, I don't always go there with Korean friends, so I don't believe the service is ethnic-sensitive).The meat is always good, the banchan (appetizer plates) are ok, and the key thing is that they cook the meat over real charcoal rather than gas grills.  I've enjoyed this place, and I'll likely go back again soon.I've heard that many of the true Koreans have stopped frequenting this place because, similar to 88 Tofu House, it's gotten good reviews in the \\"popular press\\" (e.g., Creative Loafing) and as a result it's been increasingly overrun by us non-Koreans.I spent some time in Korea this past spring ('07) and I noticed that in a lot of restaurants, the wait staff don't always actively come and check on you to see if you need anything... you had to explicitly call them over.  As a result, however, it was perfectly normal to just shout to them and they'd hustle on over.  The secret words: \\"Yogi Yo!!!\\" (when said fast, almost sounds like yogi-oh, which is what I actually thought it was for about a month... \\"yogi\\" means here, and \\"yo\\" is just a polite modifier, so it roughly translates into \\"over here, please!\\").  If you're not Asian and you shout that, they'll probably be pretty surprised but will likely appreciate your effort to communicate in Korean.Also, be sure to try the Soju if you're a drinker... similar family to sake and vodka (I guess sake is made from rice, vodka from potatoes, and soju I believe is made from a particular kind of sweet potato).  It's pretty light tasting and smooth, and goes well with charred animal flesh (it's got a bit of kick to it as well since it's about 20% ABV).And yes, there's a strip club and/or adult movie theater in the same lot, so you might not want to bring l'il Timmy with you.

Side note, if you love the bread at Eastern Standard, you'll love the bread at ICOB because they share a bakery.  The salmon tartare was also really amazing and fresh - I loved the texture juxtaposition of soft and crunchy. Undoubtedly, we over extended ourselves on the starters and didn't leave enough room for the main course. That being said, I really enjoyed my catfish because it was lightly crispy on its own without any breading.

Our tapas arrived in a thoughtful order that I can only assume was done deliberately by the waitstaff. We began with saut√©ed wild mushrooms over grilled plantains and potatoes fritas in a delicious ailoi sauce. Next came the meatballs in guava, onion, and tomato sauce and the chicken and goat cheese served on warm bread and topped with roasted yellow and red peppers. Though already stuffed, we ended our meal with a selection of cheese and guava preserve, figs, and almonds, which was beautifully displayed on a cutting board.

Our only complaint is we both would have liked a little more teriyaki sauce on the chicken. The portions were good as we both left full.We plan in going back to try out their breakfast."},{"name":"Smokin' Betty's BBQ + Bar","address":"94 Lafayette St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"OMG! Best barbecue in a long time. I wrote ahead to find out what I could eat with my allergies. All the meats were an option so this was a go. I settled on the baby back ribs and brisket.

Tonight's specials were jambalaya and porchetta, the type of things you would expect when Marc is in the house. I had to try the porchetta even though I was full.

I love the food, but the place suffers from many shortcomings; a lot is contained in the one star I deducted.For vegetarians like me, the food doesn't get much better than this.  And for everyone, it doesn't get much healthier than this.  My favorite is the swami, because it has a bit of a spicy kick.  Whatever you order, you'll get a filling, healthy meal that's probably very different from anything you've had before.  The food itself deserves five stars.  It's not cheap, but it's worth it.The juices and smoothies are good, but extremely expensive for what you're getting.  I order a juice whenever I've been eating particularly poorly and feel the need to load up on nutrients.The service is fairly friendly, but just not that competent.  Most of the people who work here are tattooed hipster types, which I decidedly am not.  After you place your order, you're given a number card and take a seat.  When your meal is ready, a server will bring your order to you.  On a few occasions, the server has lost the slip of paper that went with my food so that she could tell which number card it goes with.  Twenty-minute waits for one's food are not uncommon.  A ten-minute wait just to place your order is par for the course.The restaurant is often full, which makes it all the more necessary for the staff to do a better job keeping order.  Too many people fail to realize that they're supposed to bus their own tables, so they leave their plates there, and the less-than-competent staff takes an awfully long time cleaning it up.  There's always a long line that clogs up the top floor of the restaurant.  When meals are prepared, they're left on a counter for the server to pick up -- where they remain exposed to all passers-by, and where the line of people waiting to order invariably gets in the way of the server.The clientele is a mixed bag, but you get a lot of young people and a lot of hipsters.  I am always amazed by how long it takes people to order.  When you've been standing in line for 10 minutes, you should really know what you want by the time you get to the front of the line!  Life Alive also doesn't make things easy for newcomers; it doesn't have any signage explaining the rules (e.g., if you're on line, stay to the left; bus your own table; choose whether you want a plate, a demi, or a wrap; if you've called in your order ahead of time, you can skip the line; etc.).The restaurant also gets extremely humid.  I could really do with a little less of a \\"natural\\" environment when it comes to the lack of air-conditioning in that place.  I suspect this is also part of why the smell of the food always lingers on my clothing long after I've left.All that said, the food is really terrific.  My suggestion to customers: if you live nearby, call in your order, then pick it up to go, and don't wait in line to pick it up!My suggestion to management: ask someone who has consulting experience to suggest ways to make your operation more efficient."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been to Island Creek Oyster many times for drinks.... and the oyster sliders.

I went with the causas, traditional ceviche de pescado (white fish ceviche), and Lomo saltado (a saut√©ed beef with Chinese influence). All were delicious with hearty portions. In a country where ceviche is a mainstay for lunch along the coast,  it bugs me that it is served in tiny shot glasses in the states as a tapas delicacy.

I love the sewing machine tables and turquoise walls. The baristas have always been jovial.There is one reason I didn't give them 5 stars: speed. Since this is the only good coffee shop in Buda, it can get crazy busy. Not a big deal, but in those moments, it seems like either there needs to be one extra barista or they shouldn't accept call-in orders.But here's my real piece of advice that I hope Summermoon folks hear: Grandma's Coffee Cake has got to be there every single day.

I loved the cute outside seating and Portland was giving me great weather so I was happy about that. What did we order? Ike's vietnamese fish sauce wings, papaya pok pok, and sii khrong muu yaang. The fish sauce wings we ordered spicy and they came packed with flavor! I was very happy that I wasn't disappointed. The wings were crispy, saucy, and had a side of daikon I was happy to munch on. The sii khrong muu yaang was basically short ribs and they were OKAY. It didn't blow my mind I've had better pork ribs with more flavor. The papaya salad was where I became VERY disappointed. The waiter told me it was \\"really spicy\\" but that didn't scare me! I took it as a challenge! The papaya salad was not spicy AT ALL. Not even a little bit.

Food (5 stars): We had the Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings, Khao Soi, Pok Pok special, Put Kaprow. Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings: This dish is a must especially because the wings are so large! It is worth every penny. I love the saltiness and the sweetness of the fried juicy wings. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pok-pok-portland?select=I13N5hUk6_GG2cIwvoxA6A#xCAX44g_JWSBvreHKrmtmgKhao Soi: Another dish I definitely recommend! It is a very interesting dish in which crispy yellow noodles is drowned by a bowl of yellow curry. I loved the combination of spices and it had a hint of spiciness. It is served with side of chili and mustard greens. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pok-pok-portland?select=I13N5hUk6_GG2cIwvoxA6A#B6Wl7Jhr5DQmCN5lell0TwPok Pok special: As it is described a game hen that is served with a papaya salad. We decided to get this dish because its the name of the restaurant but I didn't find anything special with the dish. I would recommend skipping this dish. Put Kaprow: This is ground beef stir fried with basil, onions, and chili peppers. It is usually accompanied with a fried egg and a side of rice. This dish was on the spicy side. Nothing special but its a must have at any Thai restaurant. I would recommend also skipping this dish and to try another dish that you cannot get elsewhere. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pok-pok-portland?select=I13N5hUk6_GG2cIwvoxA6A#squX0mLeCEFvd9kYc9izPgAmbiance (4 stars): This place literally is a hole in a wall or actually someone's home.

I agree with the sentiment--our dinner there included the most delicious Thai food we've had so far in Portland/Vancouver.  My husband concurs.I wasn't blown away by the exterior--it looked sort of fast-foodish.  But the inside of the restaurant was muted and pleasant.  And our party of 4 had an absolutely humungous booth.  Our little girl could have stretched out next to Grandma and taken a nap, head on one of the little pillows strewn on the bench, without even bumping Grandma's elbow.  With a little kid, extra room is a real bonus.We started with the chicken satay, which was delicious and nicely presented, and tom kha soup.  And I immediately fell in love with Soi9.  For the first time since leaving the SF Bay Area 4 years ago, my tom kha soup arrived bubbling in its own little hot pot.  I've really missed the little hot pots.  The soup itself was different than most of the tom kha soups I've sampled--less coconut and sweetness, more of a meaty flavor, but it was very good.  Next, we enjoyed the special Chicken Massaman (chicken curry with potatoes) and Panang Nua (Beef Curry).  I think the Chicken Massaman was the most flavorful I've ever tasted.  The Panang Nua was simply delicious, and included plenty of tasty green beans and red bell peppers.  I'm a sucker for red bell peppers.  I was unable to stop eating the curries until I basically ran out of room (darn my pregnant belly), so I never got around to trying my daughter's Pad Thai.  Maybe next time.The food wasn't as spicy as I expected.  In the Bay Area, I'm used to ordering medium-mild or 2 star and having my tongue more than adequately stimulated.  Here, we ordered medium spice, and my tongue barely registered the spice.  So I'd suggest ordering hotter than your usual (unless maybe you're a Portland native?)The waitstaff was capable and right on target with the timing.  Water was refilled at just the right time, orders taken exactly when we were ready.  Our food was brought out promptly, check delivered when we had just finished.   All-in-all, a lovely dining experience--a bit pricier than we're used to for Thai, but worth it."},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is great.

There were like maybe 6-8 Hooters size wings, $12! Good Lord! Oh yeah..right, the taste. I really don't get what everyone sees in this. These wings were SUPER salty! It just overpowered everything. I could taste the fish sauce but it was just so salty I couldn't eat it. I will say, though, I had the first bite and was like \\"BLECH!! NAASSSSTY!\\" but for some reason, I just kept on going. I did NOT like these wings at all. However, to end on a good note, the texture was pretty good. They've got that wet look, but the skin was nice 'n' crispy. Would I eat these again? For $12 HELL NO! Hell, for $2 HELL NO!...ok, maybe I'd TRY them again for $2, but it's only because I'd be giving it a 2nd chance. There's nothing desirable that makes me want to have them again.After that atrocious dish, I tried the Moo Pow Kow Lau Mau Oo Mau mau Mama Oo Maw Maw...everybody heard...the bird's the word...Kham Waan. I didn't even TRY to remember this, I just told the guy \\"Boar Collar\\" and he understood (actually I said Boar neck, but he got it anyway). I had mine togo, but I ate it in the car, so it may have come out a little differently. He recommended that I get the Sticky Rice (freaking $2 extra!) but I'm so glad he did. It's too salty to have by itself...let me explain.So there's 4 parts to this (counting the rice). There's the boar collar meat, the dipping sauce, the rice, and some greens, cilantro being one of them. So here's what you do. \\n1) Get a piece of meat\\n2) Dip into the sauce\\n3) Place flat on plate\\n4) Put a cilantro leaf on it.\\n5) Grab a bit of sticky rice and put it on top of your meat+cilantro combo and eat it.I really couldn't explain this phenomenon. What you smell is NOT what you get..except for the first 1 second. It smells like fish sauce gone bad or something. It's not a pleasant smell or taste. It's like sour fermented stuff, like bad soy sauce. Anyway, the taste lasts for approximately 0.5 to 1 second. My first bite, I was ready to go \\"BLeeaaaahhHH,\\" but then, the lime and chili kicked in, and the meat kicked in, and the cilantro kicked in. It was like someone splatted a canvas with some nasty puke colored paint, and then within seconds, the paint moved around and slowly formed a masterpiece. I thought it was a fluke, but it was like that bite after bite. The taste is nothing short of astounding! The meat is so freaking soft and tender and the sauce, cilantro, and even the rice add a whole new flavor and explosion of taste! Add the fact that you're eating this with your fingers, and it just gives you this primal rage to just eat this thing. You want to eat slow to savor it, but it's just so damn good you have to keep shoveling this stuff in your mouth! I won't say that everyone will like this, because it is a rather unique taste, and you do have to get over that 1 second hump of rotten soy sauce taste, so try at your own risk. I think people will either love it or hate it. Would I come back? You bet I would! $12 for the Mow Tow Low Cow Jow Vow Zow Boar Collar is NOT bad at all. Also, consider the fact, No tax in Portland either, so $12 is $12! I think I could eat 2 of these, but that's a $24 meal! And that's why I can't give this place 5 stars (well the chicken wings lost that a long time ago), the price is a little steep. I don't know how rare boar collar is, but it's not too bad for $12, but $12 for chicken wings?!?!!?! I think not! I wish it were cheaper, but I would definitely come back here again. Yay!

I've stayed at this hotel once last year and twice this year to attend a few industry conferences and I have to say, this is an A+ resort! \\nFor events:  Many rooms for individual sessions on two floors to host @ 1,000+ attendees and a big backyard/pool area for hosting event openings for @ 500+ attendees.  Also, the catering was very good and staff was very helpful, professional and friendly.Rooms:  the rooms that I stayed in were spacious, comfortable and clean.  They had all modern conveniences including, LCD TV's, comfortable beds, workstation desk, Wifi, great views, upgraded bathroom and nice terrace.Food/Drink Choices: they have several restaurant options on site including, 1.  Whisper Creek Farm: casual place that serves flatbreads, sandwiches and has a stocked bar w/ TV's  (good for groups).\\n2.  Primo: award-winning modern Italian restaurant that has organic garden onsite (food was very good, but everything was unusually salty).\\n3.  Citron: American fare (pastries-breakfast)\\n4. Sushi Bar: located in the lobby (casual-only a few seats)\\n5.  The Lobby Lounge: large horseshoe bar, great for handcrafted cocktails and wide variety of wines.  Note: they have a humidor w/ a good selection of cigars\\n6.  Starbucks: busy store, located in the main lobby\\n7.  Cafe Bodega: quick, grab-and-go sandwich and sandwich stor (good place for a pre-made sandwich/salad).Final thoughts:  They are centrally located to downtown Orlando, all major attractions, several shopping areas and malls and close to the Florida Tpke.  They have a full service spa, fitness center, pool and Par 72 golf course.Great resort hotel (4-diamond AAA) and a must stay when in the Orlando area, if their sister hotel (on same property) the Ritz-Carlton, is out of your price range!

For example: on Mondays they have all-you-can-eat mini-burritos. It's a little misleading because this excludes most of their regular burritos (of which there is a huge variety). However, it's cheap, easy, and delicious. I know they have a ton of other specials, but that's the one I'm most familiar with. I've come here after a night of drinking and done their chips-with-three-dips option, which was pretty great. What's not great is their guacamole - it's way way way too salty. I'm disappointed that they don't serve free chips and salsa, but that's probably healthier, right?Their beer selection is very good, but their waitresses don't know anything about their selection, and they're usually out of half of the beers that I want... and then the waitresses have no idea what the other options are. Other than that issue, the service is usually pretty good. They also have a ridiculous number of margaritas to choose from, but I usually avoid those high fructose corn syrup bombs.Overall the food is really good and they have the largest variety of vegetarian foods I've seen in Columbus and a good booze selection.

I figured a place with as many accolades and five stars wouldn't disappoint and it didn't. Gourmet magazine just named Pok Pok one of two Portland restaurants 'worth the money' and they were right on. The emphasis here is on the food - more precisely, authentic, perfectly seasoned and prepared Asian street food. From prawns to game hens, everything I tasted was first rate. Pok Pok is a little mix of everything. They don't take reservations, but they do have a take-out window. They have a full bar but you can't stand at the bar; you can eat inside; but you're likely to get a table faster if you eat outside. It's a mix, a melange and quite a bit different from what you might expect. The neighborhood is eclectic and so are the customers yet I think many of them are from out of town or at least another part of Portland.

Long story short, we received two of the three dishes we ordered, but my entree never arrived. We watched multiple tables who ordered after us receive the exact dish I continued to wait for. We understand from past experiences here that the kitchen seems to mass cook items and send them out as they are ready (and thus were not expecting all our dishes at the same time) but it is unacceptable to deliver the dish I ordered first and have been waiting for over an hour to the tables around me while failing to bring it to my table-- the kitchen should adjust accordingly and be sure the food is getting where it should go. We asked staff to cancel our steak order after watching it go out to several other tables who arrived and ordered after us, with no apology or explanation as to why we still had not gotten ours. They were extremely rude and condescending, stating that they had notified us (yes, 20 minutes ago, that it would be \\"right out\\" and it still never came).

The food took about ten years (45 minutes) to show up and this is with hardly any customers there at all. The two tiny biscuits would have had to sit in the gravy for about a week if you expected them to have any moisture in them. The potatoes wedges were okay but with only three on the plate it's starts to feel like this place is a little chintzy on the portions.

You think you can succeed in a space where another Thai place failed, Soi9?  You think you can succeed in a city inundated with Thai places?  Well, I think you can, but you need to work out the kinks.Service problems can bring down a rating pretty quickly for me, so you must have some good food to stay at a 4-star when you have other issues.  And, since you're getting that 3.51 rounded to 4 rating, you must have good food.  Indeed, I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked the fact that my Pad Se Ew came with a side salad.  It may or may not be traditional, but that's one thing that I feel I'm missing when eating Thai - variety.  I get my bowl of stuff, but when you throw it all together, it's like you're only eating one thing and nothing else.  The main dish was very well cooked, too.  Perfect noodles, a good sauce and perfectly cooked chicken (I've had that maybe twice in my years of eating Thai around here).The problem comes from what I hope is only opening night jitters.  We almost didn't eat there because the open sign was off.  The door was unlocked, however, so we went in and asked if they were open.  The question was ignored and we were asked if we were there for lunch.  So, we were seated and all seemed normal.  There was not one other person eating in there the entire time we were there though.  Aside from the off open sign, I also noticed another sign that actually said closed to the outside.  I almost wonder if they were closed but let us in for some weird reason.The waiters were very nice and attentive.  Yes, I said waiters, not waiter.  We had two.  One would come and ask us a question and then the other would ask the exact same thing about 30 seconds later.  Again, weird, but they were friendly so whatever.The thing that makes me want to give this place a 1-star is what happened at the end.  I paid with my American Express card.  The card and bill were taken away, the card was ran and brought back and I was told that \\"We just want you know for the future that we don't take American Express, but we just went ahead and took it this time.\\"  If you had the ability to take it, you take it.  Don't tell me you don't take it after running it and having it approved.  Tell me that you don't want to because it costs you more.  But don't do that either, that's bad business.  If you take it, shut up about it.  If you don't want to take it, talk to your credit card processing company and tell them to remove that option.Enough of my long review.  It was good.  Go here.  I want this one to survive so we can get some well-cooked Thai food on a regular basis.  That would be a nice change.

Pricing is a bit more than the competition at almost $4 per taco, but one has to pay the hipster premium.Pastor - pork with diced tomato and pineapple on top. Nice moist meat. The pineapple adds a nice zing.Carne Asada - steak with rice and beans, with guacamole on top. Quite tasty, though this one wouldn't rank too high on the adventurous scale.Pescado - piece of battered fish with some tangy hot sauce (hot mayonnaise?) on top and some diced tomatos. Also quite tasty, though one is basically eating fish and chips without the chips.They also have 6 types of hot sauce. Besides the 3 on the table (red, dark green, green), there are 3 more against the wall (red, dark red, green).

My fiance and I were having a lot of trouble finding a nice pho place to eat, until we accidentally stumbled on this place one rainy fall afternoon.  We voweled never to go back to China Town (please see my review for Pho Pasteur) after several awful exeperiences there. The menu is HUGE and offers a wide variety of different dishes and options.  They also serve wine and beer which is a bonus.  The food is what real Asian cusisine is all about- fresh fresh and FRESH!  The ambience is also great.  Not the typical rush around cafeteria style Pho place like all the others we've experienced and water is NOT a rare commodity here.  This is an actual restaurant where they seat you anywhere you want to sit and accomodate you any way they can.  The music is a bit silly, but it's soothing and it makes for a happy place, plus they keep the lights nice and dimmed.The service is more than exceptional and since we go there quite a bit, they know our faces and always welcome us with open arms- literially.  The tall male server (I forget his name- I know, I suck) has built a kinship with us and when I was pregnant over the summer made us promise to bring the baby by so they could see her.  When we did in fact  one evening (we stopped in to grab some food on the go) and he took her picture with his phone.This place is the BEST for Pho and other Asian cuisine hands down!

I had been to Pok Pok Ny before and was really looking forward to going to the original restaurant where it all started in Portland. If there was one thing that reminded me of why I love Pok Pok, it was absolutely Ike's wings! Maybe the greatest wings I've ever been served! The wings are glazed in fish sauce and the flavors just jump off of them! The meat was tender and the wings were soooo sticky good. It's almost indescribable.In addition, if there is another must on the menu, it's the Coconut Ice Cream Sandwich. I can pretty much guarantee I had never seen this served in a restaurant before. It was literally multiple scoops of coconut ice cream served in a sticky bun with peanuts and sticky rice! Yes sir, you can double-take on reading that! It was really unique, but incredibly refreshing since it was 90 degrees outside.As for the rest of the menu, be prepared to do some reading as each item is spelled out to the very last ingredient. Descriptions easily ran 4-6 lines! However, you'll be presented with as authentic of a selection of Thai food as you can find in the U.S. One thing I did notice was that the menu was exactly the same between Pok Pok Ny and the original Pok Pok. Also, the restaurant is pretty big with seating exposed to the outside, as well as indoor seating. It wasn't extremely crowded either when we came by on a weekday around 2pm, so just prepare your taste buds for some of the best Thai food you'll ever ever have!"},{"name":"Gennaro's Eatery","address":"12 Blanchard Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"I really like this place for cheap night of simple and casual dining.

My favorite dish here is the lobster and pumpkin ravioli sauteed in a sage and sherry cream sauce...mmmmmm, so dang good.  And for like $12??? OMG.  If you order their garlic bread, you'll be served garlic butter and herb flavored pizza - like 10 inch maybe?  It's a lil different but it's yummy and it's only $5.  If you don't finish it, wrap it up, take it home, add tomatoes or sauce and cheese and turn it into a pizza..You will ALWAYS have food left on your plate when you eat here so you're really paying for like 2 meals.  1 star taken off for the 1 the only time the food was just \\"not 5 star.\\"  The lasagna my bf ordered was not heated all the way through.

I do much of my graphic novel shopping here, as their selection is massive, there are many used copies of popular titles, and those shelves are located in the coffee shop for easy browsing.The size of the place may be intimidating, but it is very well organized, with staff kiosks located all around the store and computer terminals for searching their stock.  They have a decent selection of boardgames, but like most storefronts for boardgames you're going to get a much better deal online. Powell's is an amazing stop for holiday/birthday shopping.  If you don't spot a book that might suit someone's fancy they also have a wide selection of quirky knickknacks befitting Portland's 'hipster' sensibility.

The patty is a remarkable accomplishment - always perfectly cooked and handmade with only ground sirloin.  That's it - no binding agents, no seasoning, nothing superfluous to take away from the taste of the beef.  Considering how remarkable the taste is, it's impressive that the texture achieves the same level of excellence.  If you like seasoning and random chuck meat (not pure, ground sirloin), Costco has a nifty case of frozen patties you'd be interested in - machine-made, heavily seasoned, and probably contain some small percentage of sirloin, too!"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Life Alive is a good place to go if you want to order, eat and leave within an hour.  It's like the fast-food of the vegetarian/vegan world.  Everything is steamed; therefore, you won't have to wait too long for your food.  The place is crowded and small, looong lines to get to the register (this is where you order...hopefully you will have had enough time to read the menu up on the board behind the register or the paper menus which you can grab by the counter).  After placing your order, you have to try to find a seat either upstairs in the very crowded, noisy area, or downstairs (which reminds me of a my parents' \\"cellar\\"  when I was a young teen trying to give it a psychedelic look....dark, purple paint, peace symbols,.. will someone pass the peace pipe please kind of vibe, if you know what I mean). It's definitely a throw-back theme. As for the food: One of the reviews by Lauren stated how she ordered and paid for avocado but never received.  This has happened to me on not one, but SEVERAL occasions. The dishes are not made consistently well, some have too much sauce poured on them, others have missing ingredients, but the flavor is usually very good. What makes them 'different' are the sauces.  The Swami is my favorite, but I have tried their salads and wraps, also. Their lentil soup is great!  If you're looking for good tasting food at a very good value, I would recommend.  Three stars only though for atmosphere.  Too loud with a not so clean feeling at the tables due to the high volume turnaround perhaps.

The options of frozen yogurt are also pretty lack luster. 2 of the pumps weren't even working!  The set up was also awkward.  They had sampling cups next to a register pilled up not on top of each other like an organized place but loosely in a bowl.  You get your sample cups and go get your fro yo sample then you gotta walk to the other side of the store to throw your sample cup out.

What sets it apart from the other local pubs (e.g., Playwright, Beer Works, and the like) is that it's light, bright, clean and doesn't smell like a frat house after a beer pong tournament. We went on Halloween Day for a late lunch. The place was packed with football watching, beer pounding frat boys with a smattering of girls in questionable outfits (the question being: is that a Halloween costume? Or do you actually wear tiny skirts sans spankies and low-cut slashed tops everyday? Perfectly valid question). The TVs were playing all the football games and were labeled so those who can't read 60\\" HDTV screens could tell what game was playing on which TV. The hostess was kind enough to ask if there was a particular game we were trying to watch to make sure we were seated in close proximity to a screen showing that game. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to start. The flavor was satisfactory and the pita chips are a nice twist. However, the pita chips were absolutely soaked in oil. It would have been nice if they were less greasy. For my entree, I chose to get the chicken parm sandwich with the sweet potato fries. When the plate came out, it looked so tasty. Huge foot long sub, cut in half, doused with sauce and cheese. It looked perfect. The taste, however, threw me for a loop. I have an expectation the chicken parm is going to be savory...salt, pepper, Italian bread crumbs. The chicken was battered in something SWEET. It tasted like my chicken parm had made out with the honey BBQ wings before heading to the fryer. What a hussy! The taste was so contradictory to the marina that I just didn't enjoy it as much as I should. It would have otherwise been an amazing sandwich. The sweet potato fries were very good. I'll come back again to try the pizza (which looked amaze-balls), but I'll skip the chicken parm."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best.

Definitely check out the specials menu they have posted up!The food here is kind of on the pricey side, but I really think it's worth it. It's different than typical thai food as it is based on Northern Thai influence which is more savory and spicier and less sweet. (So no pad thai or pad see yew here!)

If I'm eating lunch out this is where I'll be.First off, I'm a wing snob. I used to live in Florida where we had several places that just served wings, nothing else. I'm using to great chunky wings. I like my wings dry and this is one place in Portland that can do it and still have the flavor. I get mine lemon pepper seasoned with all drummettes. Most Portland places fry up some tiny wings, drench them in sauce and then sling them to you. Not so here, my wings are always nicely dry and very edible. I've been to Fire on the Mountain and Old Chicago. Fire on the Mountain, both spots, are too Portlandized for me; Old Chicago has good jerk wings but my stomach starts complaining afterward, I don't know why. I've tried wings pretty much every where I could in Portland trying to get back to that utopic (I'm even creating words I like it so much!) experience and Wing Stop is the closest. I didn't mention the good sweet tea (put some more sugar in it to make it really sweet!), that makes me almost feel like I'm back watching Florida State beat up on Florida again!You're gonna ask me about Buffalo Wild Wings next, right? I've been there and the only \\"dry\\" wings they had were a seasonal flavor. Sorry but I ain't a seasonal eater.If you call in your order you can have them ready when you get there.

It's rice bowl was sadly on level with Brigham Circle Sushi. Just get the wings though, they can scrap the other billion items on the menu.1st Encounter: Ordered takeout from the place, rice bowl special, spring roll apps: I thought the spring roll apps were excellent, I enjoyed those a ton but they were short lived. The rice bowl teriyaki special was very underwhelming. The veggies did not taste fresh nor were there a ton of them. There was a small bone in my chicken :( I know it happens but I'm on a bashing roll here. I felt like they quickly browned chicken and veggies poured in some sauce and ladled it on to the rice. I would not order that again. I could do a better job in my kitchen with a frying pan... did they even use a wok? I would rather have a similar dish from Wok and Talk2nd Encounter: Shrimp Pad Thai Lunch special: It was just meh. I thought it had everything a generic pad Thai would have. Nothing stood out and said \\"come here for Pad Thai!\\" To be honest I would go to Wok and Talk for their Pad Thai over Mission Hill Sushi and Wok. I got the crab ragoon and felt the same way, it was just underwhelming. If you are going to launch a new restaurant at least do something above and beyond to have me come in the second time. The only reason I came again was because their menu is so freaking large and they cover so many foods! So now I rule out Thai and whatever Teriyaki chicken falls under.3rd Encounter Online Order: Saw Korean Wings on the menu had to order again. I'm addicted to Bon Chon's crack wings so maybe this could measure up? 8 Piece Wings and spicy tuna roll: Ahhh found their wheel house! The wings were really really good. On par with Bon Chon, the Soy Ginger Excellent and the Korean BBQ out of this world. If you want wings come here! The spicy tuna didn't jump out at me. I am partial to Sushi Station down the road because they seem grateful for my business always make sure to ask how everything was last time I came in (even though I'm sure they don't remember me) and offer tea constantly while being willing to chat me up. Also I noticed someone else ordered online and their food was done before they asked it to be done. I had the same experience on encounter 3! I want my wings piping hot burn my fingers level when I pick them up not sitting around for 15 minutes before I asked for them to be picked up.Come for the wings!

Our wait was a brief and reasonable 20 minutes.  The cocktails and the raw bar kept us entertained until we were ready to place our dinner order.  We totally submitted to next table order envy and ordered the whole friend sea bass served with the simplest relish.  I tried to tell my husband that I could devour this on my own but was patient enough to wait until this was served to order the lobster roe noodles.  I was pleased that this wasn't creamy or overbearing --- pasta noodles done perfectly well with generous servings of lobster and braised short rib.

I just bagged it and walked to the other cashier to order my pie since she was free. Haha..so my drinks got delayed. The frappe tasted like ice cream, which I obviously liked. It's a bit smaller than I expected but hey, less calories and don't need to splurge more than necessary (eg. at starbucks). The iced coffee wasn't anything spectacular and it was indeed just 'iced' not cold or anything. I'll try ask for a cup of ice on the side with regular coffee next time. They ran out of strawberry pies (?) and only had apple pies left. Not sure why she said strawberry. Did I order strawberry rhubarb pie? Anyways, apple is fine. I like apple pies.

There was excellent people watching to be had, and the wait staff was very kind and didn't mind that I took up a large table as I waited for longer than I thought. There was patio that I missed out on since it was so hot, but I would consider siting there if I come again. Unfortunately, the special this particular day was a drink special (actually, not a problem, but it was a Wednesday if ya feel me). I had the Mushroom and Beet Burger with a side of Curry Quinoa salad. And a little free ice cream! Everything tasted delicious, and as a non-vegan, I would recommend the burger to anyone who may not be familiar with vegan dining. I also heard that the pizza was a good option. Probably the only downfalls here were that I was disappointed of the portion size of the sides and that flies were constantly pestering me."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"It all started with a phone call Saturday morning. We were going to have a large group coming in and they graciously took my reservation. Although, the reservation wasn't necessary as we were the first and only ones there that morning, it is still a good idea for any party larger than 5 (as per their voicemail). It is indeed a small dining area. If you plan on coming here, make sure you are not in a rush to go anywhere. This place is very laid back. The very nice woman serving us seemed to have been the only one serving, maybe the owner? She is much older and only has 2 hands.  The rose lemonade was delicious and a must have. You can not come here without getting a pitcher or two. I also had the Chicken Djadje and for $4.95 - how can you go wrong? I agree with Jessika that it didn't taste very Afrian/Moroccan, but either way I was very satisfied. It was pleasantly spiced and wasn't dry, but just the right moisture (you know what I'm talking about). The bread was the perfect thickness, texture, and softness. It also came with spicy pommes frites. These were okay, but not bad. Though I would have expected them to be spicier. It was more like fries with hot sauce tossed on top. But hey, for $4.95 I don't really care about the fries since the sandwich itself it well worth the price. Definitely would not mind coming back here either for a date or another group outing.

Also overpriced for amateur entertainment. 30 bucks a ticket and it was many of the performers first show.This is not a \\"murder mystery\\" show either.

No matter; when I realized I'd be the FTR, I knew that I had to make my pilgrimage here and fast! I ordered a Blenz coffee (an iced coffee) and pondered the delectable looking baked goods, but nothing really appealed on such a hot day. All that was left of their famous banana bread was a sad little slice that was not worth the purchase. The cinnamon rolls looked really delicious, however, and I was almost salivating over them.I sized up the sandwiches, which I hoped would appeal, and all I could see was thick, carb laden, bread, packaged in cellophane. But I am sure they'd be more appealing when working in the area and looking for a sammie to go. While somewhat fresh looking, their establishment of origin is not exactly one of my faves. So I took a pass on those, too.I marvelled at the retro, clean, decor on the inside, the spacious patio, and even the cute li'l bathrooms. The staff were friendly and sweet, and they hid as I took photos. I found myself feeling like a member of the paparazzi trying to hunt down the D list, which was sorta funny to me and since there were no other customers, I felt about as uncomfortable as they did. I stayed long enough to hope for a refill, but nope, it's not a SB. No discount there. Not even for a Betty doppelganger. Oh well. Since it does hold my pen name, I'm sure I'll be back quite soon.

So that's a plus.Here's are the reason for two stars: -Our waiter took our orders and gave us our drinks in a timely fashion, but after that it was like we never existed. I couldn't even find him to get our check. And when I eventually saw him, he was just chatting with someone at the bar (keep in mind that it's a Sunday during brunch hours). After several minutes, we finally get the check, then he disappears, never to come back. I had to give our payment to someone else, who I believe is the owner. We never saw our waiter again. He didn't seem professional and he looked like he was still in high school.-It took about 40 minutes for us to receive our food. I understand it's busy time, but most places, even the busiest, don't normally take that long. -I ordered corned beef has eggs benedict. I expected a lot since it had the corned beef hash bonus. The bottom of the biscuit was hard as a rock. My wrist started to hurt cuz I was trying to hack it into smaller pieces. It was still edible but didn't enjoy the food. I was too nice to ask to take it back.-Lone eggs benedict on a large plate looks so bare. Like most brunch places, it should include a side like a salad or potatoes. Not worth the $13.

IT WAS HEAVEN!!!  I would drive back  to Columbus all the way from St. Louis just to have this meal again.  \\nThe wine of the week special went great with my meal.  The only knock I can think of is that it is a pretty small venue, so they kind of jam you in there, but I kind of liked that.  It gives it the old small Italian cafe kind of feel.  \\nDon't let me forget about the butter that came with the bread.

When I checked in the other day- the front desk woman was gracious and warm- welcoming me back like it hadn't been over 6 months since I was last here.  The bellman who brought my luggage and keys to the room was pleasant, and even the server in the restaurant went out of her way to help me with my luncheon request even though they were transitioning off of brunch and all I wanted was a sandwich.The grounds are beautiful and you can walk around the lake, work out in the fitness center or hang out at the pool and drink my favorite kind of drinks- those frozen ones that taste so good out in the sun!The bar in the lobby is the place to see and be seen and the bartenders are quick to offer you a drink and a little conversation- especially if you are traveling alone.  Or sit outside with the candelight flickering- enjoying the warm Florida nights.If you have kids- there is still plenty to do around here- from the \\"Lazy River\\" pool that only requires you to sit in an inner tube and float the day away, to the entire \\"Ritz Kids\\" experience.  As one who does not have kids- I like that there is a separation between the \\"kid world\\" and \\"adult world\\" so I am not having to fend off the \\"wee ones\\" when all I want to do is relax.Yeah- I love this hotel.

I had \\"Champagne Vinegar Marinated Golden Beets - Soft Boiled Egg with Caper Salsa Verde\\" a nice starter, with a perfectly prepared soft-boiled egg, wonderful beets and a great salsa verde (9/10),  \\"Chicories Salad - Toasted Speck Ham, Walnut and Parmesan Reggiano Cheese with Balsamic Vinaigrette\\" a good salad with heavenly roasted walnuts, a balanced dressing and a nice selection of greens (I am a fan of radicchio) - the only note: the speck may have been too roasted (7/10). I continued with \\"Pan-Roasted Alaskan Halibut - Bacon, Green Bean, Corn, Chanterelle Mushroom and Roasted Tomato with Beurre Blanc\\" where just a little bit of garlic on the chanterelle would have made this dish a 10! The halibut was absolutely outstanding and went so well with the butter sauce (8/10). I also found room for the legendary \\"OCI Chocolate Dream Torte\\", fabulous for chocolate nuts, a little to rich for me, but still..  (9/10) The staff does a good job and you can surely forgive any hesitation - after all they are in a class and the situation must be stressful for them :)The timing was perfect, every other dish was ready as soon as i was done with the previous one.. maybe who complains about slowness should learn how to eat slowly and appreciate every bite!

When we sat down the server told us that it is the kind of place that you share dishes - ok we like that.

I'm actually really delighted to see Freshii pull itself back together.  Perhaps it's better management and staff all around.  I'm doing a 180 and now I can say.... I *heart* Freshii.The speed and service has improved immensely.  The consistency and accuracy of my orders are bang on every time - HUGE improvement and, now, happiness :)The concept behind Freshii is brilliant.  I like how you can customize your meal by checking off a whole bunch of boxes, and the staff makes whatever YOU want.  It's easy and awesome.  The decor is very simple, clean and bright.  Love it.The price point, for the portion size you receive, is excellent.  Salads are still epic (although, size has become smaller since last summer).  **A note when custom ordering, for example, if you expect ample toppings vs lettuce mix, you will need to check off the boxes for your \\"unlimited\\" toppings and write in pencil beside them \\"x 2\\".  It's free to do and will make you happier.I love to create & order three things here:1 - brown rice bowl - roasted chicken, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes, red peppers, mushrooms, spinach, cilantro, with spicy peanut sauce2 - spinach/freshii mix salad - roasted chicken, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, red peppers, dates, green apple, croutons, honey dijon3 - frozen yogurt - delicious soft serve style with your choice of two toppings....(double oreo! = love).  **Request that they layer in the toppings vs pouring only on top.-------\\nI recently won their business card draw - lunch for two!

The truffle oil was amazing, it added great flavor without being overbearing. My boyfriend got the Beef Wellington, and it was huge! The beef was cooked perfectly - it was juicy and tender. The prosciutto had just the right amount of saltiness. The mashed potatoes were buttery, creamy and yummy. I had the quesadilla with chicken. It was stuffed with chicken, peppers and onions and drizzled with a delicious chipotle aioli. The aioli added a really nice smokey flavor. The cheese oozed out when I separated the pieces, I'm drooling just thinking about it! I also like that they leave a giant glass bottle of water at the table.

You can also sit outside when the weather is nice.  The salmon picatta (sp?) is delicious as are the scallops with corn salad (something like that).  The cheese steak spring rolls are pretty good and a unique idea.

Friendly and efficient and gracious. Our waiter on the other hand was really young and not all that great at describing menu items or offering any guidance at all. When I'm somewhere for the first time and there are things on the menu I'm not familiar with, I like a knowledgeable waiter.We started with the Barbajuan's and the Carpaccio of Scottish Salmon. We had no idea what a Barbajuan was and when we asked the waiter, he pointed to the table next to us and said \\"There they are over there. Those fried ravioli looking things\\". Not quite the description I was hoping for but we ordered 2 of each type at the waiter's suggestion: Courgette (Zucchini) & Basil, Goats Cheese & Honey and Chicken Liver & Foie Gras. We would have never ordered the Chicken Liver and Foie Grad had we known we were ordering it. They are pretty tiny so although six sounds like a lot, it's not. As for flavor, they were ok, but the Goat Cheese & Honey were the best of the three. The Scottish Salmon Carpaccio was incredibly delicious, but the dehydrated watermelon on top didn't really add anything. For entrees, my husband had the Seared Duck Breast with Swiss Chard, Gnocchi and Black Olives and I had the Steak au Poivre with a side of Ratatouille. His duck was really delicious and my steak was good though it wasn't exactly spectacular. I had considered a fish dish and they all sounded amazing but I was already enjoying my red wine and wanted to stick with it. I don't remember what wine it was but it was from the Bordeaux region and it was delicious. I will say, the steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was not too peppery and did not overpower the meat. The Ratatouille was ok but I was a little disappointed. For dessert, we were torn because the sweet desserts sounded incredible but we also wanted the cheese plate - which won out.  We chose correctly, I think. We had the 3 cheeses available that evening: an herbed Chevre, a bleu cheese and a semi-soft cheese I never knew the name of, despite asking the waiter who mumbled something inaudible. These cheeses came with delicious, crispy bread with cranberries and walnuts in it and a side of fig jam. The amount of cheese was extremely generous. We couldn't finish all of it.Overall, it was a really nice meal and the restaurant is beautiful but I'm not sure it's the kind of place I'm dying to go back to."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"No garlic, soggy gnocchi, despite sending it back for al dente, they returned same soggy over cooked pasta.

The food reflects an impressively Thai palate - traditional Thai flavors, traditional Thai dishes and ingredients, and excellent balance of flavors.The papaya salad (papaya pok pok) is one of the best I've had.  It had authentic, Northeastern Thai ingredients, and was not too tangy, not too salty, or not too sweet, with an lovely rounded flavor.I also really enjoyed the herb salad (yam samun phrai), which is not something I see on most Thai menus.  It was refreshing, with ingredients shredded finely so it's easy to eat the tougher ingredients (lemongrass, etc.), and had an excellent balance of flavors.The fish sauce wings were plump, cooked well, and had just the right amounts of sweet, salty and spicy.The eggplant salad (yam makheua yao) and boar collar meat (muu paa kham waan) also had good flavors, but I wanted them to be a little more vibrant, with perhaps a bit more tang.  I liked that the chilled mustard greens with the pork were served on ice to keep them crisp - very traditional (though there I believe it's usually Chinese broccoli).We finished with the pok pok affogato - Chinese donut (you tiao) with condensed milk ice cream covered in Vietnamese coffee.  The ice cream and coffee were as delicious as they sound, but I wasn't a fan of the Chinese donut.   It tasted like it was purchased and then, later, sliced in half and refried for service.  The result was much oilier and crisper than it should have been.  I imagine it may be difficult to find fresh Chinese donut in the area, but think it would have been better to just toast them (and cut after reheating).Overall, we had a lovely meal.

We stood at a table in the back in Oliver's (the nightclub part) and watched the rest of the game on the projector while having a few beers ($5 for a Bud Light, it was reasonable). After the game ended, they cleared the tables and started playing dance music, which was perfect since I had been dying to go out dancing for a while.I didn't really care for the place though because of the following:\\n1) It was a sauna. If even the bartenders are sweating, you should really turn on the AC...\\n2) Broken glass and empty bottles all over the floor and they never came over to mop up spills.\\n3) Creepy tall guys (there were 4 of them when I was there) just standing in the middle of the dance floor scanning the crowd. No, they weren't employees, they were just being creepy\\n4) The dance floor was way too crowded. The layout made it awkward to go anywhere. There were railings on two sides, and rows of tables and columns on the others. I felt trapped.\\n5) The DJ kept breaking up the mood by switching to slower rap and RnB for like one song and then switching back to hands-up/top-40. I don't mind a slower song every once in a while, but have a 15 minute segment of it, otherwise it just feels tossed in.\\n6) The music was too loud. I'm young and can handle pretty loud music, but it was just excessive here.

However, at the end of our meal, she brought over two dessert cocktails because she heard us talking about how it was my friend's birthday.

I spent a total of about eight hours in this store and purchased twelve books (and I only had a carry-on bag with me...thank you, USPS flat-rate box).   I could have bought more but even *I* have some shame when it comes to book-gluttony.  I've been to The Strand twice now, so I'll have to come back to Powell's to even it out.

I am not too picky since I worked as a bartender but if I was a manager I would pretty much get rid of the staff and do an overhaul. They could make so much more money with an upbeat, responsive staff. We actually left last time because the service was so slow and spent 150 dollars at the bar right next door. I would say the food is decent. Meh. Overall the place needs serious help but stays in business because its super cheap and the crowd it brings in want that. I would return for the cheapness. Dont run to this place. Walk as slow and unhappy as the bartenders seem.."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"As far as Bistros go, this place stands above the pack.

It's good.  It's not the greatest adventures I've ever had in Latin American food, pinchos, tapas, tinxtos or otherwise, but it is pretty good.  Went for dinner.  The seared tuna atop plantains was really good, as were the albondigas, which would have phenomenal, had they not been a wee tough.  Sauce was awesome, flavor was great.  The bunuelos were doughy, and lacked that purely freshly fried pop, you'd normally get from a bunuelo.  The chorizo a la plancha, sits atop very under-seasoned yucca, with a useless coconut sauce, that does nothing to help it.  I'd argue that Casa B has the best ceviche I've tasted since moving to Somerville, but even still, it was GOOD ceviche, not mindblowing ceviche.  Cocktails were underwhelming, the pisco sour was serviceable, their caipirinha will never get top marks from me.  Two major criticisms from me.  I realize this is a Tapas restaurant, but the silverware is just....stupid.  I felt like Gulliver in Lilliput.  Also, as this IS a tapas restaurant, I shouldn't have to ask for clean plates when new dishes come out.  No one wants to eat their albondigas on the same plate as their ceviche.  Not a good mix.I ate upstairs, which is small, but attractive, but I've heard downstairs the seating options are amazing.  So with that, I'd say, give it a try for sure.  Might be a while before I return, but I probably will."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Surprised I haven't reviewed yet.

My kids were so excited to go here. They love making their own pancakes. That's... pretty much the whole deal here. The batter is meh (overbeaten, thin). The toppings, too. But, whatever, it's fine. It's pancakes. This was my first time there.Bad sign #1, the hostess sort of tossed our stuff on the table and wandered away. It's a volume operation. You people are here for McPancakeLand? OK, sit. The bigger problem was when the waitress dumped maple syrup all over my setting. And my shoe. And phone. Things happen. I get that. But she doused the whole spot in syrup, and it was mildly sticky for the rest of the meal-- a breakfast that cost us $80 or so, for two adults and three children. For pancakes and a frittata.Because I didn't freak out, I guess, she made no attempt to comp my meal or coffee or... anything. Just sort of wiped up the puddle of syrup, mostly, and split. We decided it's better to be a huge jerk when stuff like that happens if you'd like any consideration for it. I spent part of the meal in the bathroom washing maple syrup off my shoe and foot.So, the food is OK. The whole pancake on a griddle thing is cute.

The maple syrup dispensers were sticky and our waitress hardly came by, so I had to eat half of my meal with sticky fingers, along with my two kids.  The batter was grossly over-priced, and each $6.00 container only made about 4 small pancakes.  My kids left hungry, and I spent over $30.00 between two orders of pancakes, some sides for the pancakes (1/4 of a brown banana cut up into a little dish costs $1.50), and breakfast for my partner, and two coffees. My kids drank water.  So overpriced I couldn't swallow my pancakes.  Our waitress gave me the impression that because she was sporting some cool tattoos that she didn't have to provide good service, and she didn't.  The pancake batter tasted like cheap mix.  I agree with another reviewer that it's I-HOP quality, except they get to charge outrageous prices because they're on Belmont and have hipster staff.  I'm so sick of paying for shitty service & food in SE Portland.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, and we didn't even have to wait in line.

I have no idea how this place has a 4 star average unless it is the only Italian in a 25 mile radius.  Let me make it clear that I cannot eat a kid's sized portion much less an adults entree.  After viewing the menu, we decided to play it safe by having the chicken parma but with the cheese ravioli.  Both simple, straight forward items.  I mean we are talking breaded chicken and cheese filling in some pasta.  Upon ordering our entree, we informed the waitress that we were sharing because I am unable to eat very much due to gastric surgery.  At that we were informed that it would be an additional $3 charge.  This was a first and the start of my list of disappointments.  I have never been charged an additional fee for sharing because of a medical issue and even have a card showing my status and requesting smaller portions.  I was certainly glad I didn't try to order a kid's meal.  At this point I was not going to stress over the $3 charge as I needed food and I picked out a 4-star place so at least this food should be worth it.  Wrong!!!  If that ravioli was made in-house, they need a new pasta cook.  It was extremely thick and tasted as if it was from the freezer section at Costco.  The chicken was even worse if that was even possible.  Most of what I eat is meat due to needing high protein consumption.  This was the driest chicken parma I have ever had in my life.  Ever over do it heating something in the microwave?  Well, that was the chicken which left me with the idea that it had been microwaved.  That then made me think that this was most likely not made just for me chicken.  The only saving grace was that they drowned it in their red sauce so that you could pretend it was all moist and delicious.So why the 1-star?  For this:\\n1) The staff is semi-friendly but doesn't listen to customer needs.\\n2) The food was bad enough that I would have been better off going to an Olive Garden.\\n3) For the price of $17+ for 1 entree, a glass of water and a glass of ice (I can't drink and eat at same time), the fact that $3 of that was a charge for sharing was a slap in the face.\\n4) Glad I didn't bother to check in there for the free dessert because we weren't even asked if we would like dessert.In the end, it's money that was wasted, but as the boyfriend tells me, \\"It was at least a new experience.\\""},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"So many levels and vignettes of fabulous books.

It seems  that they view the other coffee houses the same way they might view a favorite cousin.   My point here is that even when I am at another coffee house, people are always mentioning that I should check out Clementine Coffee Bar.  Usually, they tell me to check out Clementine after I tell them that I enjoy opportunities to meet interesting people and expand my peer group.  I stopped at Clementine Coffee Bar at 12:30pm on a Sunday, ordered my Americano, and sat down at the bar (typically a good space to meet people).  At 12:30pm, the crowd had yet to arrive and I wondered if it would, but by 1:00pm, folks were pouring through the door ordering lunch plates and iced coffees.  The spaces at the bar quickly filled up and I had at least three opportunities to engage people in conversation.  Had I arrived on a Friday evening, I am certain, my opportunities to meet people would have increased times three.  While speaking to one of the barista's behind the bar, I also learned that one of the owners, Ryan, was in the house.  I decided to introduce myself to Ryan.  I let him know I was Yelping and asked him if there was anything specific about Clementine Coffee Bar that he would like people to know.  I figured I might learn something interesting myself.

Well, I work in the cattle industry and have eaten a lot of steak in my 20+ years and this is what it's all about right here! Visiting my sister in the ATL and thought we would go out on a \\"date.\\" We made reservations and showed up a little early. No problem, because we hit the bar up for a couple of cocktails...you know, to get us in the mood. Then, we were seated in a timely fashion to our \\"lovers\\" table. We got one of those rounded booths typically reserved for couples. They either thought we were there on a date OR could see in our eyes that we were ready to eat and needed plenty of table space. Either way, it was sweet and we got a bottle of Red to start. I believe it was the Patricia Green Pinot Noir. Very middle of the road price range, but VERY tasty (probably could have had two bottles, truth be told). We needed some apps so we went with the Rock Shrimp and Oysters (those came in a half dozen and again probably could have ordered x 2). The older sis and I were trying to compromise on everything from side dishes to potentially splitting a salad when our apps came. We got something a little unexpected too...some suit clad dude from the four top out in front of us to ask if we wanted to join their table. Sorry buddy, you look like the type who can't even grow facial hair and my sister and I are carnivores so naturally, not interested. Hold your breathe and maybe we will meet you at whatever that bar was that you just mentioned after we pound this meal. ANYHOW, back to the good stuff. Sean our super fun server came over to apologize for the desperate table of dudes and help us decide on some more feed stuffs. In true \\"on a date\\" fashion, Sis and I went with the Prime Porterhouse for 2 with black truffle butter. I made sure he would have someone slice it for us at the table because I thought Sis and I might get into a knife fight if it wasn't divided up fairly. By the way, that is standard practice for them with this cut so no big deal. Also, to our joy we only had to agree on the two family style sides we wanted to split.

Ordered the chicken wings, the boiled chicken with sticky rice, and papaya salad. They seem to shine on the protein entrees, but the salad was soggy, watered down, and on the bland side. The boiled chicken was incredibly tender, but the dipping sauce was not particularly unique and there was nothing special about the sticky rice (but perhaps I am spoiled by good Asian restaurants generally).

The service was never long or we were distracted enough to not notice anything.  Our group ordered wings first with drinks and there was always something in front of us so we weren't waiting with nothing besides the initial sit down.  SERVICE: The service here is great, very friendly and knowledgable staff.  Overall the main dishes took as much time as you would expect for intricate and flavorful dishes to be made.  We were served the wings and drinks right away so we didn't notice how long the wait was.  When a plate was empty it was removed rather quickly and our water was never empty.  The staff was knowledgable and suggested we try each corner of the menu as the different flavors would all compliment each other.FOOD: Our group ordered too many dishes to name in this review.  The food here is not what you would get at a traditional americanized Thai restaurant so it was a good change of pace.  Almost all the dishes we had had fish sauce so be weary if you do not like that.

The spicy wings (we ordered both the original and spicy) were the absolute best wings I've had. I considered getting them for a main dish as well. They were that good. The wings alone are worth the wait and the hype you've heard."},{"name":"U & I Thai Fine Cuisine","address":"3364 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We tried this after passing by several times when we got a coupon. First of all we got parking not far off which was nice. (also noticed a cheeze store down the block)I like the concept. A  mod thai. The service, especially the food deliverers (there seems to be a division between order taking and food delivery) was excellent. We got our appies very quickly. The green papaya salad was forgettable but there was a house special...  Isaan Lettuce Wrap (Yom Nam Khao Tod). Very generous proportions and extremely yummy. We also had swimming rama and pad thai. I'd say the swimming rama was very nice...and also generous proportions.  The pad thai was a wee bit spicy (a 3 on the richter scale) and I would order down next time. (Or order the curries that seem well recommended). My 8 year old had satay and white rice which he liked (not too spicey). The nice thing about this place is that it has a good drink selection as well, so you're not relegated to one type of white wine or a couple of beers. We have another coupon so we'll go again next week before it expires (my son even requested it...)Very good.

Everything comes in huge Texas-sized portions so be ready to share!The cornbread that came with our meal was absolutely amazing! Best I've ever had! Sweet and extremely soft. The garlic bulbs were quite tasty, not really my kind of dish though. The fried green tomatoes were really crispy. I'd never had them before, so I was a bit hesitant about trying them, but they far exceeded my expectations! I had the chicken sandwich, which was juicy and delicious. I love sweet potato fries and while these were not quite crispy enough, they had a wonderful spicy seasoning. I tried some of the macaroni and cheese, which I highly recommend it. The green chile has a very unique flavor.I don't think others in my group enjoyed Moonshine as much as I did, because they are not big fans of Southern food.

Coffee was good. \\nMy only suggestion is that this restaurants must have \\"flying biscuits\\" as the name claims. The biscuits they are made on sight (according to the manager), but they definitely are not \\"flying biscuits.\\" I think the problem is that the owners now are \\"investors\\" who probably know nothing about food preparation in restaurants.

They should visit the original Candler Park location to see how the Biscuit culture has survived and is doing well. \\nThis location has recently relocated from Paces Ferry neighborhood.  The new manager worked at the previous location.  She is great; responsive; interested in comments; available to pour coffee if needed.  She, and this location will do well.

Don't trust me, then google it.  Shout out to the hostess who corrected me when I called this teppanyaki.  Well anyways, Kiku is a very typical teppanyaki style restaurant,  similar to Benihana.  The cooks do not come until the whole table is filled, so expect to wait at least 15-20 min after you place your order. The ventilation was subpar, and the seating area had a layer of oil covering it.  The food was nothing super special, just chicken bathed in teriyaki sauce.  The portions are not divided evenly amongst the guests, the last person usually receiving less.  The show is a lot more entertaining and involves a lot more fire than Benihana's though.

We've been in his hometown of YVR for several weeks and have tried several HH's prior to visiting this place. My biggest pet peeve about any happy hour is when cocktails aren't on the list. I'm not a beer or wine gal, vodka soda please. In BC, the standard liquor pour is regulated to an eye dropper's worth. To pay over $5 for a well drink outside of HH is ridiculous...let alone during HH! This place is only beer and wine on HH, and a minimal selection at that. (no Chardonnay?!) I usually just leave a place in this situation but, husband was starving so we stayed. We had the halibut fritters and fresh oysters. The halibut was tasty but the fries seemed old/re-fried and were an inch or less in length. Odd. The oysters were $2 each which I immediately side eyed. There are *several* high end restaurant options in Vancouver with $1 HH oysters, so it seemed strange to advertise $2 oysters as a special price. (At many places, $2 is regular menu price for several types of oysters)  Unfortunately they were full of shell fragments  - definitely awkward to slurp and try to inconspicuously spit out shell pieces in your napkin. It wasn't just one, it was all of them. We won't be returning here, many other options for HH in Vancouver with offerings above and beyond those of the Vancouver Fish Company."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Get lost in books.

On the third floor we went into a rare book room, and I got to see the original copy of The Wasteland by T.S. Eliot, one of my personal favorite poems. I also bought a book for school, and was blown away by the foreign languages section - they have books in over thirty languages!

However, it turned out to be such a disappointment. I came here on a Wednesday for happy hour. The restaurant was pretty busy, and they only serve the happy hour menu if you sit at the bar. We got the the sangria, wine, pisco de sour and house ceviche off of the happy hour menu. From the regular menu, we got the octopus ceviche, lamb chop, tabla mixta meat and cheese plate, and the picanha skirt steak. The sangria and pisco sour here tasted okay. The sangria was not sweet enough for me and the pisco sour did not taste very authentic (I did not taste the egg white). The house ceviche and squid ceviche were good, but not authentic neither. The lamb chop tasted nothing like lamb, it actually tasted like steak. The tabla mixta was alright, nothing special. I did really enjoy the honey that came with the plate. It tasted like real honey and even came with the honey comb.  The picanha skirt steak was disgusting. It was way too overcooked and tasted sour. They also gave us complimentary bread and olive oil, the bread was very fresh and yummy. The food at this place was okay, but service was absolutely horrible. Our bartender was giving us some major attitudes and did not look like she wanted to serve us. She cleaned up our plates when it was clear that there was still food on the plates and we were still eating.  I understand that the restaurant was getting crowded and she probably wanted to clear some space, but we were not even there for that long and there were other people who were there for much longer than us. When we asked for our checks, I did a quick audit of the receipt and the food and drinks that we ordered off of the happy hour menu were not given the happy hour price. I was going to bring this up to the bartender but did not want to waste anymore time with someone who was clearly rude to us. Overall, I think the food here needs some\\nimprovement but the service really needs some major fixing.

Atmosphere/Ambience: This is certainly rustic hipsteresque with lots of grain wood, minimalistic furniture, indie tunes, and big windows. They've used the former restaurant's space wisely. Service: Always fairly attentive. Sometimes a tad disorganized at off-times and busy, but very professional and eager to please staff. Sometimes when it gets busy it seems more disorganized but nothing to scoff at or that would ruin your experience. The service vibe is laid-back but professional. Most of the services have a good handle on the drink list and menu. Though they don't take reservations, we're often able to get in no problem. I appreciate their flexibility taking in young children as you'll often find a lot of kids and infants here throughout the evenings and brunch.Food: A full array of wood-fired options exist here -- this isn't a simple pizza, bread, and dessert-only wood grill. Their market greens are charred and surprisingly scrumptious and well-balanced. Their charred oysters rock. Their pastas are always al dente, usually a bit rustic, with great ingredients. They cook simple things very well, and their complex dishes are usually spot on, too. They utilize lots of quality ingredients all around. We love the cacio e pepe, any of the pizza specials, the cheese boards are always generous with great accompaniments, and their vegetarian and protein mains are generally great (including the fish). Drinks: They have a lot of interesting NE and broader US finds. They seem to always have a dry cider rose from somewhere different that I can't help but try. Their rotating beer specials always have impressive range. Their wines are fairly good with some nice finds at less expensive prices. Prices: Fairly reasonable for the area and it being one of the nicer dining experiences but still not an inexpensive night once you get a couple of apps, drinks, and dinner. This makes sense considering the quality and service."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"For our Boston vacation, we chose Island Creek Oyster Bar over other oyster restaurants because they took reservations and I freaking HATE waiting for a table.

The manager (owner?) only talked to us when handing us the bill (and then quickly walked away while we over tipped the seemingly annoyed waitress in the empty restaurant when we came in) as opposed to the other people that came in after us. Service aside, food was interesting. Chicken Korma that my teen daughter had was tasty. Good spice. Nice presentation. Chicken Curry that my other teen daughter had was pretty okay. Tasted it and bit into a rather large uncooked spice that made for a difficult bite. Tried my wife's Lamb Vindaloo where I bit a rather large uncooked spice that made for a difficult bite. Finally, my Lamb Biryani had huge Allspice berries (I believe, I'm not a foodie but have had a solid background in Indian food, but admittedly not Pakistani) that made me have to chug half a glass of water to swallow. I would've chugged one of their many drink offerings, but we were never offered one, as is often the case in most restaurants. Also were told that there was no Lamb Kababs or Garlic Nan from a place called \\"Mumtaz Curry and Kababs\\", which was odd since two of the four at the table had lamb, but hey, I've never run a restaurant so I don't completely understand how you can offer a protein in one meal and not the other. The waitress/hostess (in lieu of the guy who went to the other two tables  and had good conversations about the menu that arrived after us) never came and asked us how our food was, because I would've mentioned that their medium spice was f*cking hot.

I took 3/4 home, because I didn't want to be rude, and I'll try again later to eat the leftovers (the Biryani had a ton of rice, so good on them for portion size for that.)

I update this review not to sh*t on dish dive but more because I care about the integrity of my reviews :(We've been coming here for years, no less than a dozen times, have recommended this place countless times to others, and we actually got our wedding cakes from here! Without the original crew of Jeff & Travis, this place has lost its magic. The staff that was there on Saturday night were incredibly disappointing. We made a reservation nearly a week in advance, and showed up 10 mins early. We were patient, we know how slammed they get, but once we saw several parties arrive after us and get seated before us, we started to get pissed. We overheard the other parties saying they didn't have a reservation which added to our frustration.We decided to stay purely because of the food, as we were seated over 40 minutes late. Looking back in the kitchen and not seeing Travis was sad, but we still had faith. Unfortunately, the meal did not deliver. We were used to creativity and inventiveness, unpredictable combinations that were delicious. Instead, we got okay tasting food with none of the extra zip we had become accustomed to.  If dish dive hadn't been so good in the past we wouldn't be so disappointed now! The food was still fine, just a huge let down from how it's been and can be. I can't recommend this place, and I won't go back unless the original staff is holding down the fort.

I am a little obsessed with cheese plates. This bistro definitely has a French-farmhouse vibe going on- I love everything about the decor from the faux-tin ceiling, to the French loaves sticking out of a metal bucket, to the shelves of condiments on the wall, to the glass jars of olive oil behind the cash register. I have had dinner once, cocktails and appetizers a few times, and breakfast a few as well. This place introduced me to the Singapore Sling, an old-fashioned cocktail, and gnocchi (I know, how had I gone so long without gnocchi?), so I will be forever grateful for both of those things. Service is always great once you get to a table, but that first walk-in-the-door moment could use a more prompt, friendly greeting. I hate the feeling of walking into a restaurant and being unsure of the protocol.My one problem with Everett Street: I have tried to go twice in the last week and found them closed, regardless of the hours printed on the doors. On a Monday night (they recently started opening for dinner on Mondays) my boyfriend and I walked over and were greeted by a chalkboard sign inside the locked door reading \\"Closed- Sorry for the Inconvenience\\". Another time we were looking for a cocktail at 4:30 pm and entered the restaurant, only to be told by a kitchen worker, \\"oh, sorry, we are closed from 3 to 5 every day\\". Seriously?? With the happy hour expectations that this town brings? Also, their hours say \\"Open at 8 am Everyday\\", with no mention of that two hour gap. A little notice might be helpful. This speaks to a little bit of a lack of professionalism in my opinion. But, that wild mushroom gnocchi was damn good."},{"name":"Chung Ki Wa","address":"27 Riverside Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in the Boston area.

CHICKEN!I have to tell you I'm a die hard fan of their chicken here. As much as I love Korean fried chicken, I'd probably say this beats all. After being in Korea for almost a year and roaming around in search for great chicken around the Bay Area... Portland's Pok Pok has gotten me HOOKED! Asides from the Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, I enjoyed their Kaeng Hung Leh, which goes well with their Jasmine rice. I highly suggest ordering rice with it as it tastes better when it's mixed together. The flavors are great and hits the spot! However, the portion they give is pretty small, but it's enough to satisfy you.The prices here aren't so much on the cheap side, with ordering just the chicken wings, kaeng hung leh and rice, It was probably already over $30. But it's worth it. One thing that threw me off though was my recent visit. I ordered the lime thai tea and asked if I can get some evaporated milk on the side. The bartender gave me a weird look and hesitated to even continuing grabbing for me it seemed like just because she advised it would 'curdle'. I told her it wouldn't as I always mix these three together. She eventually gave me some, but I felt like she was offended that I still insisted on asking for it which was pretty obvious through how she approached my friend and I when taking our order. She didn't even bother asking: \\"are you folks ready to order?\\", rather she just stood there look at us. Because of this I refuse to give this business 5/5.Anyways, I would still recommend this spot to visit to anyone planning to visit Portland.*If you're planning to place an order be sure to do it through their website."},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Delicious, authentic Cuban Food!

If I am spending over $100 on dinner for two people without any drinks, it would be nice to have parking validated or discounted. \\n3. The prices are high. Maybe they are making up for lost revenue because they do not have a liquor license, but I think some of the items are overpriced for what you get.

Come on out early-ish on Sunday morning (9 or so), when all the college kids in Allston are still nursing their hangovers in bed and the streets are quiet and covered in trash from the night before. This joint has some damn tasty chicken & waffles. The breading is really nicely seasoned and the chicken is fairly juicy for boneless chicken. The cornbread waffle is really nice- light and fluffy. They're super generous with the amount of chicken you get and I couldn't finish my meal.They offer sausage gravy, which I got just because I was curious, but the syrup is a better compliment. I'm from the south and I love me some sausage gravy, but chicken and waffles are supposed to go with syrup, it's just the way it is. The gravy was also a bit thick for my liking, though the flavor was on point- my husband ended up using it as dip for his potatoes, because he's gross like that. He got the breakfast montecristo, which he enjoyed.

They are located in a part of the SE 82nd and Foster Fred Meyer complex I was shopping at, so it was super convenient.  I ordered a teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu combo which included steamed rice and my choice of either a salad or steamed vegetables.  I asked the lady at the front counter what the steamed vegetables consisted of.  I mentioned that I hoped it had plenty of broccoli (a super food!) and not just mostly limp cabbage.  She said their veggies were a good blend of fresh broccoli, carrots, and cabbage. . .so I chose that.  OK, the meat for both the teriyaki chicken and the katsu was tender and tasty, although the breading on the katsu was just slightly too crispy (katsu was probably fried a bit too long. . .not a big deal). I liked the taste and the thick consistency of both the teriyaki and katsu sauces.  The sauces stuck to the meat and weren't thin and watery.  The steamed vegetables were a good blend of broccoli, carrots, and cabbage, just like the lady said.  Overall, everything was flavorful and of good quality, but a little bit more chicken for the $8.95 price would have been nice."},{"name":"Eddie George's Grille 27","address":"4575-4667 Sawyer Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"I've eaten here several times since choices are limited beyond security.

We don't order from here very often, but when we do it's always an amazing experience. This holds especially true during finals and other times of high stress. The wings from Wings Over Sommerville saves minds and lives. Most of the time we get bone-in (and I would advise to get bone-in unless you want to inhale chicken strips faster than you can take breaths and then regret gorging on two pounds of friend chicken ten minutes later). I will admit that you get more food when you order the boneless, but for the sake of your health and the inevitable indigestion that follows get the bone-in just as a way to slow yourself down. Also, the waffle fries are delicious, but if you're getting delivery I would suggest asking for the cheese on the side because they will come soggy and weird. The order online function is great, especially for phone phobic people like myself. We always get it delivered to a college campus, but they come right to the main gate and we've never had a problem with delivery, although one time it did take them over an hour to get there. To be perfectly honest it's a little pricey, but in the end if you don't order all that often, it's a good way to get a group together to enjoy some good food.

This has been one of mine and my boyfriend's favorite place since I moved to Oregon almost a year ago since we love their Ramen. Almost every week I would bring visiting friends from out of state. Yesterday, I brought a family to have them try it themselves. We are used to 45mins to an hour waiting and we didn't mind. We came when they text us our table is ready. I reserved for 8  plus one high chair since we have a toddler. They said they cannot put us altogether in 1 table so I agreed to be on 2 separate tables.When we got there, only 1 table for four is available. We had all 3 kids and the mom seated first. So the parents were behind the table tending into the kids. The waiter told us that they cannot be standing there cause they are on their way( with an attitude). Politely I told him, well you called us so we assume table is ready. The mom should be there to tend to her toddler...\\" and then we waited by the crammed door entrance another 25mins or so and the waiter said a table for 5 will be available soon. Before the rest of our party get settled, I asked if my guest with kids can take that bigger table instead so they can all be together, the parents and the 3 kids... the waiter hesitantly says ... you're not allowed to change tables, but go ahead whatever you want...\\" and just when we are doing so, a woman( without a name tag approach me saying... You're not allowed to that..\\" I said why, doesn't it make sense that they seat altogether? She said no, you cannot do that cause you're disrupting the flow and causing disorder...! I said \\"what?! is this the way you treat customers???\\" So frustrated from the beginning and unpleased by her statement... we decided to just leave and dine somewhere else.On our way out that same woman, chase me by the door yelling and said.. you're 86 here and you cannot go back anymore! I asked for her name and asked for the manager and she said \\"no you cannot, and I am the manager, go or else I'll call the police!\\" An absolute display of unprofessionalism and evidently lack of skills to be a manager.I am really disappointed and concerned that loyal customers would be treated with such disgraceful manner.

It's a long story. We're on the same team, basically, though we play the game differently, and have different offerings to what we're entangled in. On my way out the other day, after coming to see her for the first time since she'd opened - I told her \\"You humble me (like the Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings song).\\" She laughed it off, as is customary of her character.I only ate one thing off the menu. I sat right in front of the cooks though, and watched Burdock & Co. do its thing intently for a good hour and a bit. They were close to closing up, and I'd come in solo to discuss something with Andrea. Staff energy was high, powering through the tail end of a Friday. It was quite the show.What I had was as good as it could have been. To critique a menu like Chef Carlson's with Burdock & Co., is to meagerly voice a difference of opinion.What I want to say here though, is that I'd try anything from her menu - anything. I'd ignore my dietary restrictions, to try anything she'd give me. Andrea is a Chef who you'd want to be with in the event of a zombie apocalypse. Her knowledge of local produce, the act of growing said produce, drying, preserving, pickling, salting, curing, and on and on - that's why you'd want her. If you gave her enough time, she could turn a plot of bare land and a nearby forest into an amazing (and healthy) meal for you with a smile. Very few Chefs in Vancouver have her rounded expertise, and the ones that do come close to her, lack some of the depth that she has - especially in terms of her knowledge of production. What she's doing now is very much a part of who she is; what she's doing now is more true and enjoyable than what she did for Bishop (\\"Bishop's\\" on W 4th Ave...). And, the title - Burdock & Co. - is perfect for what it is. You might want to do some research before you go here to try and appreciate it like you should.

Or maybe eggplant. Can't recall what they had, but that is my approximate usual pizza. Then they send it through one of those conveyor-belt-type ovens to cook.

However, as soon as he had the sample of the moist brisket, all his worries melted away. We ordered some ribs, some moist brisket, an jalapeno sausage, a small creamed corn, and a coleslaw. The moist brisket was amazingly outstanding! (Yes, it deserves two adjectives). The ribs were very tasty, but not fall-of-the-bone soft, like I expected. The jalapeno sausage was, also, excellent and my number two favorite after the brisket. It was my first time eating creamed corn and I thought it was excellent. I liked Rudy's BBQ sauce too.

However, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to an out-of-towner and wouldn't rank on my immediate list of places to eat in Midtown.  My breakdown:\\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK: They have your standard pub fair, but specialize their famous totchos ($10). I've also seen them murda the Bloody Mary game on the 'gram, so keep that in mind while planning your weekend brunch plans.  I did not have a totcho, unfortunately, and opted for a dozen oysters and their Piedmont Park.*Piedmont Park: Their signature sandwich consists of mesquite pork topped with Coke BBQ sauce and blue cheese and apple slaw. Everything was all in between a jalapeno Kaiser roll. Taste? All right, but I wished I ordered one of their burgers, instead.*Oysters: I think they were from the Gulf, and they tasted fine. They lacked a bit a salinity, but I couldn't complain about the price (which were around $1 for each at the time). They definitely hit the spot. For drinks, they have plenty of local brews, standard cocktails, and wine. In other words, there's something for everybody. II. SERVICE: I sat at the bar. Super friendly people and the food came out fast! No problems here. III. AMBIENCE & DECOR: It's a neighborhood joint with a fantastic patio, nice bar inside (as I mentioned before), and ample seating inside.IV. PRICES: Fair/ affordable, especially for the price.V.

Night two marked our visit to Giacomo's, TDC's division rival and sworn blood enemy [citation needed]. Since these two bitter rivals are located just a block or two away and serve similar seafood-themed Italian food, it seemed only fair to compare them directly to help you out. Menu Availability:\\n*The Daily Catch, as their name suggests, serves only what they caught that day. \\n*Giacomo's has a more trustworthy menu that does not seem to rely on the whims of the local seafood or noodle-catching industry. \\nWINNER: Giacomo's Wait time / Seating Arrangements\\n*The Daily Catch has a seating occupancy of exactly 20 chairs. The place is hectic, small, and very Boston. There is a line out the door, and I can use present tense because I'm positive that there is a line RIGHT NOW as you read this. Inside, the place is cozy, so be prepared to make new friends and share a table for four with another couple. \\n*Giacomo's, on the other hand, had an even longer line (about an hour and a half wait). Fortunately time flies when you're waiting in line drunk after a brewery tour, so it didn't seem that bad. The line gives you a great chance to people watch, catch up with your dining parter/group, and generally stand in one place for longer than one usually does so. Inside, we shared a table with two different couples. Neither had a Boston accent, so we considered this a huge victory. \\nWINNER: The Daily CatchPopulation:\\n*The Daily Catch will have over 50% Asians (so you know it's good), but you will be overwhelmed with Boston accents from everyone else, including (especially) the staff. There will be a lot of screaming, which is apparently how people talk up here. \\n*Giacomo's is a fairly standard restaurant.\\nWINNER: TieFood\\nWho cares about food, let's skip that part. Food\\nJust kidding, here come the reviews. \\n*The Daily Catch: luckily, they had caught some delicious fish that day. We got the appetizer portion of the black pasta aglio olio (apparently they use squid ink to make their pasta harder to find at night), which was one of the top 5 pasta dishes I've ever eaten, and I can cook a mean macaroni. Warning: if you don't like garlic, or are a vampire, or are afraid that squids are always watching you and will know you ate their ink, avoid this dish. If none of those apply, you NEED to eat this. Both the aglio olio and the puttanesca are out of this world. It's worth stopping here just to try them. We also got the Fra Diavolo (for two), which is one of the more overwhelming dishes I've ever seen, what with the ridiculous amount and variety of seafood. It was a very good dish but for $70+ I wouldn't get it again. But that squid ink pasta...spoiler, we came back again to get more of it  \\n*Giacomo's wants you to like them in spite of their flaws (the wait), and to do so they bribe you with delicious food and fantastic service. As far as bribes go, this makes sense as the choice for a restaurant. Anyway, we started with the fried calamari and the garlic bread, then moved on to our main dishes of pasta with salmon and sun dried tomato and fusilli with seafood and fra como sauce (a half and half mix of two sauces). The calamari was delicious but heavy, and the garlic bread was heavy but delicious - calamari won our appetizer mini battle. The pasta was unbelievable. Both dishes were so good that I could eat them every day for the rest of my life, assuming I won some sort of lottery and also lost some sort of bet where I had to only eat one food. Overall I left ridiculously full and ridiculously satisfied. That was some GREAT pasta. \\nWINNER: Giacomo's  Service\\n*The Daily Catch wants you to hang out, eat slowly, and infuriate the people waiting outside in line who can see inside and watch you prevent them from eating. They will bring your food eventually, when they feel like it. You won't care because it's delicious. \\n*Giacomo'swantsyoutoleaveassoonaspossiblesohurryupandeatandleave\\nWINNER: Giacomo's - you wait for an hour and a half to eat for half an hour, but they get your food out quickly so you're not waiting around. Note: The Daily Catch is cash only. So is Giacomo's. \\nWINNER: Tie\\nOverall\\nI liked Giacomo's better, but it depends on what you're looking for. You can't go wrong with either place.

A brightly lit buffet of sushi, intricately garnished and neatly placed on a porcelain white platter waiting to be devoured by ME! Ok, I know what you're thinking. A sushi buffet that's actually good? Trust me. I've been to some pretty shady sushi buffets, so I can feel your pain, frustration and devastation. So let's start with the presentation. When you walk up to the buffet, it's immediately apparent that someone took pride in making these maki rolls and nigiris. Each one was consistently garnished in a precise and neat manner, quite the contrary to most items that are being made in mass quantity. Also, you won't see the buffet overcrowded with sushi. It is steadily brought out so as to not appear as a congested rice conglomerate when you're trying to make your selections. Rather, each roll or nigiri is distinctively separated and quantity controlled. With a limited number of each kind of sushi out at one time, I was afraid they would run out, causing a much dreaded wait for the sushi to be replenished. However, these people were right on top of things and no such wait occurred. I also particularly liked that someone was frequently wiping down the counters around the buffet, which made it all the more appetizing. The buffet had your typical hot side/cold side and grill. Noteworthy items from the salad bar were the raw oysters, crab legs, and already peeled and de-vained boiled shrimp. Probably the only negative thing about this night was that the crab legs were way overcooked. I am hoping it was just a one off thing. Aside from that, there was nothing on the buffet I didn't like. The array of salads are awesome, from asparagus, salmon, eggplant, okra, and bok choy, each had an eclectic mix of Japanese style. However, don't be fooled, most of the veggies in the salads were fried before tossed in a deceivingly light vinaigrette. As for the hot bar....well my advice is, don't waste your time. But if you must, it wasn't bad, a decent mix of seafood and beef. I'd say lots of beef and seafood here. Chicken was rather scant. I didn't even get to the soups but they had udon, miso, and crab. Not sure if it's really worth the room in your stomach with so many other great things to choose from. I was so sad when it was time to go, although I did top the meal off with desserts. Of course, the mini \\"I can eat as many of these as I want and not feel guilty\\" cake pieces were there....so that's just what I did."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pok Pok has very flavorful food.

I have had this both mild and spicy, and honestly, I cannot tell the difference between the two- the spicy is not spicy at all. The wings are nice and crispy, and the fish sauce flavor is delicious. Like everyone else, I would definitely recommend the wings. During this visit, we also tried two new items: Kung Op Wun Sen and Kaeng Hang Leh. Kung Op Wun Sen- prawns, pork belly, and noodles in a clay pot. I feel like meals that are cooked in clay pots really bring out the flavors in each ingredient. There is a good amount of meat and noodles in this dish. I really liked it and would recommend. Kaeng Hang Leh- flavorful but it is literally 4 small pieces of meat. This dish was expensive for what it is. I will not be reordering this one. The service during my visit was not so great. We had a tall lady with short brown hair. She was rude and not personable at all. We ordered papaya salad, and she warned us that it was spicy. We asked for extra spicy, and she told us that were not able to accommodate that. Ok.... then we requested it to be made Laos style, and again, she told us that they were not able to make it this way. I have seen posts/photos of people who have ordered it Laos style. She was just short with her responses, and it felt like we were annoying her."},{"name":"JuiceLand","address":"1625 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Soul Boulder - so good! Gave me the idea to now add cinnamon to my own smoothies (paired with vanilla it tastes like a Teddy Graham). This just has so much goodness to it and in my opinion did not taste too sweet or too rich. One issue with this place is the prices. Some of the products are reasonably priced, but some are crazy. My 16 oz Soul Boulder, which I finished in about 10 minutes and I would not necessarily call a full meal replacement, was about $11. Thank goodness I had a half off coupon cause I personally would never pay that full price.

The much raved about Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings are a salt fest.  There is a strong flavor, but overall masked by an incredible amount of salt.  The cat fish over rice noodles was very refreshing, but I wasn't a fan of the strong dill taste even though the fish and noodles both had great texture.  The sweet pork belly in Burmese curry was my favourite.  However, why people would wait 45min+ for this restaurant is beyond me.  Good place to try out the hype if you don't have to wait long.

It's shocking to hear some people say they are too sweet, or the non-spicy are too spicy overall. They are definitely the best wings I've ever had and we continue to come get them. I'm sure I could probably eat them every week (and heck sometimes we do).The boar collar is also something we get regularly (and is especially great if you like spicy stuff - plus it comes with tasty leaves to cool you down).Their drinking vinegars are also worth a try as they are quite tasty and something a little different overall (alcoholic or non).Really though if you try anything get the wings (especially the spicy ones if you can handle a slight amount of heat) and you will not be disappointed. We always want to try something new but I can't bear to go without them when we go! I would highly reccomend getting some rice too (the coconut is our favorite and generally I hate coconut its just so subtle here that its perfect).Surprisingly the to go orders are nearly as good and is usually what we do (2 orders of wings, 1 spicy, and coconut rice) because this place is generally super busy.Anyways, get the wings!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Strand but organized!their foreign language section really stands out as the best I've ever seen.

I've been to a few places here in Austin and fell in love. This was sadly not one of those places. I had errands to run at the market next door, so I decided to stop in for some bibimbap and black bean noodles. I stood awkwardly for about 10 minutes by the door while the staff watched tv until they took notice of me and seated me. I didn't want to let that deter me from getting a good meal and the smells coming from the kitchen were too tempting. So I sat down and waited to order. Took a while for staff to come take my order. Again, I didn't want it to phase me since I was pretty famished and had a craving for Korean food. When my food arrived any disappointment I had disappeared. The food portions are terrific. I ended up having to take my noodles to go untouched because I filled up on the bibimbap, so come hungry and bring someone to share with! Now my only two complaints are the services and those little Korean side dishes. You know the ones I mean, those tasty little appetizers that get you pumped for your meal. Usually they're one of my favorite parts of eating at a Korean restaurant. I was super disappointed by the selection here. They were honestly nothing more than some garnishes on tiny plates and some kimchi. I'm used to having squid, seaweed salad, and all that good stuff, so I was pretty shocked at what I was. As for service, they seem prone to forgetting about their customers. I never got a refill, and waited so long to be seated and again for my check.

We had the fried artichokes and courgette flower beignet, the latter being the prized starter.  For the entree, we had the Seared Duck Breast and Roasted Monk-fish with Grilled and Roasted Eggplant.  Both were cooked perfectly, and the monk-fish dish was well balanced with plenty of rich flavors and textures from the eggplant, tomato, capers and olive oil.Perhaps the only drawback was that we were seated next to a private party room which had some large glass sliding doors that were repeatedly announcing themselves with a thud as servers and guests busily went in and out.

The queso is phenomenally good!  In fact, it may now be my favorite queso in all of Austin, and that's saying something!  However, I'm withholding my five star rating for two reasons:1) The prices!  While I absolutely love the taste of everything I have had so far (about 1/2 the menu), the prices are a little high -- I mean, $15 for queso, two tacos and fountain drink?  Really?  Really?  Did the price of food skyrocket and I just didn't notice it?  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that everything is cooked to order and made fresh -- that alone is worth it's weight in gold when it comes to great food.  But really, $15?  I can get the same meal at Taco Deli for about $10, give or take on what I order.  But, the tacos are sooooo good at Torchy's that I'll continue to grace them with my presence and hard-earned moolah on a regular basis.2) Their breakfast tacos.  To be fair, I've only tried breakfast there once, and it was actually at the location on the Drag by campus.  Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed after hearing so much about how good Torchy's is (my experience at the drag location shortly after it opened was my first Torchy's experience).  Maybe I'll be fair and give their breakfast tacos another try sometime in the near future, but with Taco Deli about the same distance as Torchy's from where I live, it's just too hard to give up the Jess Special and Salsa Dona from Taco Deli.All that being said, I absolutely love Torchy's and will most definitely continue to frequent their excellent dining establishment.  I am in LOVE with the Baja Shrimp taco.  The Mr. Pink is good too, but I'd prefer a little bit larger piece of tuna.  The Republican is pretty good, but it's nothing special.  I don't think I'll order it again unless I'm really craving sausage.  The Crossroads is excellent.  I was really surprised to see the brisket cut into cubes rather than traditional thin slices, but it was perfectly cooked -- juicy, soft and tender -- it melted in my mouth.All in all, I highly recommend Torchy's for lunch or dinner -- breakfast I'll still have to reserve my opinion on until I'm willing to give it another shot, but the queso alone is to die for and worth the trip!  Oh!  And an added bonus, they have excellent fountain drinks!  Imperial Dr. Pepper!  Can't go wrong with soft drinks made with real cane sugar!

Yes, there were kids everywhere, but a mimosa cures all, and we were too busy making blueberry pancakes to care.

Since Denver/Boulder is short on places that have a real deal authentic TexMex margarita, I've been somewhat of a regular here. Food & drink quality is consistent with the original Texas locations, as is the interior decor and level of cleanliness, but they've changed management at least 3 times since I've been going. The last manager, Dessie, was amazing and I always loved coming in. I'm not sure who the new manager is currently, but under his management, the service has gone waaaay down. To the point I don't even want to go in anymore. Which is so sad. :( The last 2 times my boyfriend and I were in, we had horribly rude and bad service. We tried to avoid getting Dio as our server the second time, but failed. We were planning on eating dinner there and we were really hungry for THEIR food, but since he ended up being our server again, we just ordered 2 margarita's and took off, making it a point to not give anymore money to the establishment as long as that guy is still there.

Even though we were smack dab in the middle of her section, after bringing us our food, she seemed to be purposely avoiding us (more on that later). I had to raise my hand and call her over twice during the meal because she kept breezing past us without a glance.We started with some bacon puff appetizers that were very tasty. Looking back, I would say they were the highlight of the meal, and that's really just sad. After some discussion, my husband and I decided on the Steak for Two, a dry-aged Porterhouse that was embarrassingly expensive, but since it was a special occasion, we figured -- what the heck! We ordered it medium-rare, which, in hindsight, was a mistake on my part as I prefer my steaks more on the medium side. What came to our table looked nice, already sliced and covered in jus. Taking a bite of the strip side, however, I had a different opinion. It was chewy and rubbery and not at all appetizing to me. Did I order it too rare? Maybe, I'll concede that's a possibility, however, even a rare steak shouldn't make squeaking, rubbery noises when you chew...and chew...and chew. The filet side was cooked more toward medium, but was still just ... fine. To her credit, the waitress realized that we weren't happy, and halfway through the meal someone from management came out to find out what they could do to fix the situation. Let me say, that guy was a little scary -- polite, but really stern, like he was pissed he was even having to have this conversation. We waved him away and finished our meal, just wanting to get it over with at this point. As I said the filet side was fine, and I filled up on that and the sides which were also fine. Not great, fine.It was at that point the waitress wrote us off and avoided us like the plague for the rest of the meal. At one point, my husband, his back to the restaurant, made a comment about her absence, not knowing that she was passing right behind him to another table. She glanced at me, startled, but instead of stopping and asking what we needed, she hurried past to help the other customers. We skipped dessert, and only had one drink apiece, and our bill was over $100. For a really good meal, I don't mind spending that much once in a blue moon. But for a meal that was just okay?

It is only available for take out. For $11 you get  half a game hen, sticky rice, papaya salad and 2 dipping sauces. The hen is exquisitely seasoned with herbs, not salty, and barbecued. It is delicious by itself but there are 2 dipping sauces to make it even better. One sauce is a delicious dark mystery with herbs. The other sauce reminds me of sweet chile sauce. The sticky rice comes warm and is handy to sop up chicken juices and sauce. The papaya salad tastes great and adds a delicious crunch.

Every table was packed, but we managed to squeeze into a two-top in the corner.  Unfortunately, this was right next to the bins where they kept dumping the dirty dishes.  I wish this was a little more hidden.  It was hard to enjoy conversation when the dishes kept clanking as they were deposited into the bins.  The place is pretty plain.  There's a fish tank right at the front, but otherwise, it's pretty bare.  FOOD (4/5): It was alright. We ordered sticky rice in lotus leaf, steamed chicken feet, pork siu mai, shrimp dumplings, and pork wrapped in noodles. I thought the chicken feet was okay.  It didn't really have the flavor I was looking for.  The pork siu mai was pretty standard, as were the shrimp dumplings.  I did enjoy the sticky rice and the pork wrapped in noodles.  The prices were pretty reasonable.  The cheapest dishes were $3.50.  All in all, our meal cost around $20 - that is the five dishes with a pot of tea.SERVICE (3/5):  I wish I could say that the food made up for the poor service. We ordered five dishes with the thought that we would order more if we needed it.  Well, nearly thirty minutes go by, and we wonder where our food was.  Most dim sum places I've been to will bring out dishes as they are prepared by the kitchen.  However, Golden Lotus will serve food in the order the orders are received.  We were told that other tables were waiting for their food.  Well, we might have ordered more food, but the thought of having to wait another forty minutes for our food was too much.Will I go back?  Possibly.  I'd think twice about when it's busy, but if it weren't busy and I was in the area, I would come back.

The four-course dinner consisted of an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. Each course had a decent amount of portion, not like most fine dinning restaurants I've been to. First Course- Chicken Consomme\\nSecond Course- Ten Herb Salad\\nThird Course- Grilled Carlton Farms Porkchop\\nFourth Course- Brownie & Vanilla Ice CreamThe Chicken Consomme was basically chicken broth with some finally chopped carrots and pearl-like pasta on the bottom. It was flavorful but I would probably have liked it more without the pasta since they didn't taste like anything except little balls of flour. The ten Herb Salad was really great because it was full of leafy greens/herbs and was tossed in a really light vinaigrette which didn't make the salad oily and heavy to eat. The porkchop was the star of the show! Normally, I do not enjoy eating pork but this porkchop was so tender and precisely cooked that I finished every bit of it! It was juicy and well seasoned and extremely tasteful! The greens on the side, however, were too salty and buttery for my taste.  The dessert was good but didn't stand out for me. The brownie tasted like most brownies I've had except less sweet. Maybe I'll try ordering the Creme Brulee next time. All in all, I really enjoyed my time here.

I'm waiting to see actual 'snake oil' on the shelf one day.\\nSecondly, the place is kinda pricey.

The whole town is snowed in. Friend, and stylist to the stars and pharmaceutical companies, L.N., is in desperate need of oyster shells for a photo shoot the next day. We call around and yes, ICOB is open after being dumped on. Yet again. We hailed a cab and left the warm and comfy confines of JP and arrived at ICOB to be greeted quickly, efficiently and warmly. We debated sitting in the main dining room but thought the bar area fit our more laid back crew. Drink orders were taken after much perusing of the cocktail menu. That took awhile because they all sounded absolutely amazing. I had the High Pines because I'm a sucker for both elderflower and grapefruit. I had several more. One dining companion ordered the clam chowder which he said was excellent. I, alas, could not try it. I don't do bacon. Which is a shame because it looked and smelled amazing. We also ordered some fried cod cheeks to share which were seriously, one of the best things I've eaten in Boston this year. Then we went all raw. We ordered a big combo of stuff that included a bunch of island creek oysters, some clams, shrimp, lobster tail, and a crudo of some sort. All excellent. But that wasn't enough. We needed more oysters. So we ordered another sixteen, taking the advice of our very knowledgeable waiter. We ended up with four different kinds, spanning both the east and west coasts. Our conclusion: east coast oysters are far, far superior. And ICOB was more than accommodating when we had the rather unusual request of keeping all the shells of the oysters we just slurped down. They even threw in a few extra. The photo shoot was a success and ICOB will definitely go into the high rotation and recommendation line up."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Only one thing wrong with this place........they're not open 24-7.

Their bbq and grits was an odd dish, which is probably why I can't find it on their brunch menu anymore, but the actual grits in the dish were tasty. For a friend's birthday, we came here before going to a baseball game. We shared a Blue Lagoon fishbowl. They poured in a whole pint glass of tequila. Really a good value ($30) and definitely a fun environment to enjoy some drinks outside alongside Piedmont Park! We suggest you share the bowl with 3-5 people. Their buffalo chicken totchos were good, but a little lacking on the buffalo sauce. My friend and her boyfriend ordered the Mac Daddy totchos, which they said were good but also lacked in the topping department. Overall, I enjoy the Nook every time I go!

You can also choose to get squid ink pasta instead, but the server recommended it the traditional way if it was your first time. The service was also impeccable -- there was only one guy but he made sure that each guest was well attended to and took the time to actually talk to you when he had a moment.

Chicken cacciatore is my absolute fave, but the eggplant parm, spaghetti, and a lasagnas are all delicious, too. They clearly make their pasta and sauces from scratch. Note that the wine and beer selection are not particularly inspiring. But the deliciousness of the food will intoxicate you enough. Not super cheap, but check out their website for their nightly specials, which will save you some bucks. Also, the portions are so huge most anyone would be ok splitting an entree."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Go here for the atmosphere and eat mussels as appetizer and black pasta as main dish - nothing else.Atmosphere:\\nThe North End location is definitely a charming hole-in-the-wall place, as many say. The atmosphere is special, as you can watch the cook operate and it is an experience to dine here. You practically sit in the kitchen while you're at The Daily Catch (which is the great thing about the atmosphere). You should consider that when picking your cloths, you will take the good smell with you once you leave the restaurant. You will have paper napkins and you will drink from plastic glasses which adds to the atmosphere (not necessarily to the taste of the wine, though). The cook interacts with the guests and it's all very friendly and family style. We loved it, because it is so different. Food:\\nThe food is as fresh as the name indicates. We had really good mussels as appetizers in a very good and tasty garlic white wine sauce. That was clearly the best dish we had in the restaurant out of all dishes we had. It was not creative, but very well done. Our other appetizer choices were a salad and calamari. The salad was nothing special, the calamari were way too far on the rubber side.\\nFor main courses, the best dish was the home made black pasta alio olio style. Very rich taste, very well made pasta with an extraordinary look to it. Again, not a lot of creativity in the taste of the dish, but very well made. The other pasta dishes with clams, scallops and either white or red wine sauce were disappointing. The sauces were tasteless. I dine out a lot, and I cannot remember the last time I had to add salt to the pasta sauce. You could fix them with some salt and chili to get a little kick, but they stayed boring. On one dish the pasta was undercooked (okay, rather undercooked than overcooked, but still), other than that pasta was fine but not home made. The seafood coming with the pasta was fresh and good. The amount of pasta would have satisfied 2-3 people per dish. All food is definitely as they say 'no fuss' which I clearly like, but I prefer no fuss with great taste.Drinks:\\nThe wine list is as anything else very simple, in no fuss style. We chose the regular Primitivo, which was a good table wine. Drinkable from the plastic glasses, if you leave the little wine snob in you at home.I would give a 4 star rating for the mussels and the black pasta and a 2 star rating for all the rest of the food. I would go there again for the atmosphere and since I now know what to order."},{"name":"U & I Thai Fine Cuisine","address":"3364 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay so I've raved to more people than I can remember about how good this U & I Thai restaurant is. The 3 times before when I ate here, it scored five stars in all major areas: food quality/value, service, atmosphere, etc.... so it is with quite some dismay that I update to a three star review for U & I Thai based on my most recent visit.This review is for a dine-in dinner experience with 5 people. Right off the bat, service wasn't there from reservation through to arrival and seating. Throughout the dinner, drinks often went unfilled and we were slow to receive any attention (even to order). Note: the restaurant was not busy, maybe 30% capacity on arrival and 50% on leaving. Two stars.Food quality and value were both misses. Biggest issue: we did not leave feeling full despite a huge order of food. Here's roughly what we ordered for food: 2x stuffed chicken wings, 1 feature satay (6 skewers?), tom yum gai soup, green papaya salad, fried rice w/ crab meat, some chicken thing (can't remember which), stir-fried duck with thai basil, one of the curries, 2 orders of rice, and possibly a veggie dish. Don't think it's just me when I say that should be an ample amount of food for 5 diners. Portions felt much smaller this time. Anyways, enough about that, on to quality! The flavour was pretty good for all dishes, but the only one that stood out as great was the curry.

You get two sandwiches on their AMAZING biscuits and you can make one with hash and the other with anything your heart desires (in my case, that's sausage).

I love having things shipped to my door, I love being able to shop in my pajamas, I love buying baby wipes and professional texts in one quick transaction. I love the internet!

Because I have set very high standards in the way I treat those with whom I do business, I rarely receive customer service that exceeds my own standards and expectations. This is the first time I have ever written an online review based on a positive customer service experience that I personally have had. The past two occassions I have been at Firehouse Subs on Polaris Parkway I have had the pleasure in placing an order with Spencer. Both times, Spencer has gone above and beyond my expectations and provided me with an outstanding experience in what I would consider fast food dining. He is both professional and has positive interaction with customers. In both instances dealing with Spencer, not only was my food prepared in a timely maner, but he also engaged in conversation with me and asked me to return to Firehouse. This evening, while discussing my boyfriend's taste in hot sauce, he mixed me a personal recipe of different hot sauces, which was a perfect compliment to the cheddar beef brisket that I ordered for my boyfriend. He not only wrote the sauces on a piece of paper for me, but explained where I could purchase these hot sauces to make his concoction, if my boyfriend enjoyed the recipe! After this he once again invited me to return to Firehouse Subs on the days he would be working to let him know what my boyfriend thought of the hot sauce. (Andy LOVES the sause by the way!) Spencer is just a kid... who has excelled in service and excels in his lower scale position of simply making food. Based on the phenominal service I have received from him, I am confident that he is only going to excel future. Firehouse Subs has a real gem of an employee, and I will continue to order food from this franchise in the future completely based on my experience with Spencer!"},{"name":"Ristorante Roma","address":"1216 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There really isn't much I can say that others haven't.

She asked if he had any Latin songs. He spewed back some nasty, racist comments at her that were UNBELIEVABLE. Not worth repeating it verbatim since it is just sad and revolting. It is 2014, and we are in a large, diverse city. Close-mindedness and racism are everywhere, but I suppose in a context of a bar in the middle of a big city, one would expect something more tolerant and inclusive. He could've said, \\"no, we don't have any Latin songs\\" and left it at that, but he chose to make sure it was known what he thought of anyone of Latin descent.

Thai Star Management/Owner if you are reading this and really care about your business, here's what could've done when you realized you made a mistake.1. It's not a rocket science to put an order together at the first place. Especially you don't have any other people at the time of taking down the order as well as when it's been picked-up. No excuses there.\\n2. Rather by saying, \\"Can you come back?\\" -- What about \\"Would you mind coming back to get it, please?\\" Or even better, \\"Would it be okay if we deliver to your appartment if it's okay with you?\\" (Maybe go an extra mile to delivery a drink or something to make it up and impress your customer while deliver the rice noodle).\\n3 When the customers did end up going back to pick it up (for the mistake caused by YOU), maybe see that as your last chance to make it up, rather than just a plain \\"sorry\\".This is jsut a very unpleasant experience overall, regardless of what the food tastes, they failed at the customer service big time.

And this was its second strike (I've been here perhaps a half dozen or more times). The setting is wonderful, perfectly Portland - all the reclaimed furnishings, wood, light fixtures - in some ways better than what the McMeniman's do. And you gotta love their delivery bicycles. After that things go awry. With so many wonderful choices for pizza in town (Apizza Scholls, Ken's Artisan are the best) and even faster slice joints which are fantastic (Sizzle Pie!, Hot Lips, Flying Pie and even Blind Onion and Pizzicato) why can't they get it right? I mean they claim their dough/crust is the freshest around (check tabletops for the flyer on that). The crust is capital \\"T\\" Terrible. I mean its not quite cardboard from the frozen aisle - but very close. The toppings are limited and the value is low (cost for pizza is high here - and it doesn't match/respect prices expected to be paid in the neighborhood). I'm glad Rachel Ray stopped by but she must have only approved of say, the salad? I think the antipasto is just so-so to boring. It comes with all things that you'd find as toppings for a pizza, and comes with a heaping portion of bread triangles that are basically their dough without much else. The tomato sauce needs a bit more spice or kick or something. I got it with garlic and onion and it was still just blah, boring. The waitstaff is inconsistent. If you go in at a slow time expect slow to no service. When they are busy they seem to work better as a team.  I recently had Papa John's take-n-bake and honestly it blew this place away and was about 25% cheaper. To be honest I even like Sparky's late night specials better - and that's saying a lot.

By the time we finished dessert, it was 11:45 so we decided to just stay put for the next few minutes, thinking maybe they would do some kind of countdown or something.  Nope! Instead, they were taking down decorations, moving tables, etc.  The party next to us tried to get champagne and shots, from what we overheard, the bartender was pretty pissy.

Steel Toad does not shy away from beer styles that other brewers are afraid to take on.  Right now they have a Berliner Weisse on that is quite aggressively sour.  Sour enough that they offer woodruff or raspberry syrup as an add-in, just like you'd find in Germany.  They've offered a Brett. beer as well.  Of course the more mainstream beers are well-brewed as well.  Anyone can brew a rip-your-face-off IPA, but I think theirs have a nice balance.  Especially the \\"east coast\\" rye IPA that is on offer right now.The food is great as well, although maybe a little too far on the high-brow side, for a regular customer.  Not that beer drinkers don't deserve great food, but some of the dishes can come across as a bit hoighty-toighty.

We dined in and paid for almost the entire meal for two with the gift certificate - $25 - and we each had leftovers.Without going into detail and duplicating other Yelpers, it is very reasonable and the portions are quite large. The food is not out of this world but it's better than average, especially for the area. It's of high quality and the preparation is quite on point.The service is ok, it's \\"neighborhood service\\" as I have coined... which is the casual, kind of not entirely attentive service where they call you \\"sweetie\\" and \\"honey\\" and then forget to refill your soda... but it's not entirely off-putting here, since it jives with the family restaurant vibe plus the food overcompensates.This is, as another Yelper said about an inferior Quincy restaurant, \\"an old-school, red sauce Italian joint.\\" There are a variety of meals available, but much of what you'd expect. And it seems like it's all done well. Even the less impressive items are merely unremarkable, yet consistent and good enough - and that's the worst items we've had there (though nothing particular comes to mind, which is itself a great sign).The real story here is the pizza, which I get take-out once or twice a month. It's incredible. It's probably the best part. Not only is the pizza quite good, but it's fairly reasonable, it reheats well (I bake it at 375-400), and the service from the takeout window is great.Full disclosure... I reheated some pizza from Tuesday night just as I was writing this... amazing...It's a true family business, and I get that feeling every time I pick up pizza. They also have a great deal on Tuesday where you can get a free small cheese pizza with any large pizza at full price. Not bad!

I've tried their pizza, different pasta dishes, ravioli, calzone, lasagna, and desserts. I also have tried their rotating daily specials.Pizza: \\nIt's heavy on the cheese, I had a friend who thought it was too much. Personally, I'm all for more cheese. The ingredients are all very fresh, probably bought daily. It's always cooked to perfect, never burnt nor doughy.Spaghetti Parms (Chicken/Eggplant): \\nI was never a fan of eggplant parmigiana and unfortunately it didn't change with Gennaro's. On the flip side, the chicken parmigiana was excellent. Classic Gennaro's, they give you what looks like two pieces of probably 1-lb chicken breasts. The chicken was very juicy and the outside was not dried up and tough like how a lot of bar&grill places cook chicken breasts. Warning: Lots of cheese tooSpaghetti w/ Homemade Meatball*:\\nIf there's one dish I would recommend, it would be this. It's really back to basics with this dish. They have a no-nonsense sauce, it is stacked with layers of flavor and not watered down at all. The meatball is homemade and is delicious.Calzone:\\nThis is by far the best value you can get from Gennaro's. Whether you're getting the daily special calzone or the regular calzones, it's only $7.99. For this price, you're getting a 16x4x1 (inches) calzone. It is jam-packed with enough food for almost three meals. Also, it tastes fantastic, just don't try to eat it all, you'll fall instantly asleep.Lasagna: Skip this, wasn't that good.Deserts: Try all of them, they're all good, especially the rum cake and the chocolate cake.Specials:\\nGenerally speaking, I've had no bad experiences with special (seafood, steak, etc..), except for the ones that look like a mashup of the regular menu items.If you're looking for gourmet Italian food, this may not be the ticket, but if you're deathly starving and you want some American Italian comfort food on a budget, this is your place (I'm in that mood 95% of my conscious day)."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite restaurant!\\nThe food is almost all organic, including the soy products.\\nI love their vegan food and their fresh smoothies and juices.\\nYou can have a demi bowl or a full bowl of most of their dishes, or make a wrap.\\nYou have to stand in line to order, and it can be busy and noisy.\\nBut it has a fun community feeling, and sometimes live music."},{"name":"Pon Thai Bistro","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Took my girlfriend there for dinner this weekend, this place is more on the fancy side (that was pleasing) with most meals around $15, great service and good portion sizes.

It didn't taste very authentic, it didn't come with crushed peanuts, pepper flakes or chives like an authentic pad Thai would.

We ordered coffee, a tube of batter, two toppings and bacon.  The bacon was pretty dry, and our serving needs were extremely low, considering that we were otherwise making our own breakfast.

Love love love love LOVE Moonshine.In fact, I would even go so far as to say that it's my favorite restaurant in Austin (!).The little gem tucked behind the Convention Center near 4th and Red River has delicious and original menu offerings...I have loved everything I have tried here...Chicken Almondine, Green Chile Macaroni, Snapper, Griddled Polenta, I even liked the corndog shrimp and I am not a fan of shrimp at all...and the veggies that come with the entrees are plentiful and tasty. Not to mention the cornbread muffins AND the delightful seasoned popcorn that they bring in a tin bucket to munch on while you peruse their menu.  The atmosphere is as wonderful as the food. It's very charming, from the historic building that houses the restaurant right down to the mason jar water glasses. This is a very popular place but you can call ahead on weekdays, and I have found that the earlier you get there for dinner, the better! They do have quite a bit of seating, both indoor and outdoor, and the outdoor areas are heated for year-round seating.But by far, the best part about Moonshine is the Sunday Brunch. Oh. My. Goodness. The best brunch I have ever had (and I have had it more times than I can count). So many delicious dishes, both traditional and non-traditional. A bit pricy at $15.95 but well worth every penny.

The bar had a flat screen playing a fireplace scene which was fun for the holidays.The servers were very nice and attentive.We ordered some pork satay skewers, the chicken laab and green curry with prawns.The pork satay came a bit cool, we sent it back and they threw it back on the grill for us. It tasted OK, but a disappointment for us.The chicken laab was quite good. The server asked us how spicy, we ordered 3 which was spicy, but this traditional dish has to be eaten spicy. We ate it with some sticky rice and lettuce wrap. Yummy!Finally, the green curry with prawns came. Funny, the server didn't ask us how spicy for this dish and I have to say it was disappointing. It wasn't spicy, and it was sweet. In fact it was too sweet. Also, it only had 4 prawns in it. 4 prawns for $14.95? You must be kidding.After tasting this, I felt the style seemed to have been westernized with the sweet taste. Maybe too much sweet coconut milk in it, not sure.With the Groupon it was still a pretty good deal, but the last dish kinda killed it for us. I guess too many years living with a Thai or Laos house mate.I wanted to give 2.5 stars because it was just a little short of A-OK, but seeing so many high ratings, I had to give 2 because I have had better."},{"name":"Mitchell's Steakhouse","address":"45 N 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Very attentive service, our waiter did an excellent job.The food was overall very good.

The buffet selection is pretty big and is replenished often enough. \\nI have to say I liked most of the dishes. I found the eggs, especially the pesto ones, a disappointing after what I read in other reviews, but that might be because I like my eggs on the creamier and runnier side. Also the grit was noting special, not cheesy enough. On the other hand everything else was pretty good. The cornflake fried chicken was super good crispy and not at all greasy. Other highlights of the meal were the cheese spreads for the bagels, the broccoli and cheese rice casserole and the jalape√±o sausage.I did not have any dessert except for a small apple danish because I was rather full from tasting pretty much everything else and I am not a dessert person in general, but the danish was really good, made me regret having eaten so much of everything else!Great selection, not everything is top notch quality, but after all it is a buffet.

It was nostalgic and great to see a welcoming assortment of Asian beers, including the usual suspects of Tiger, Chang, Singha, and my personally revered Taiwan Beer. The Laap Pet Isaan may have been the best dish of the entire meal, with perfect spice and flavor balance that made me crave a return trip. The other stand out dish was the Kaeng Hang Leh, which features sweet, tender pork belly bathed in a hearty, curry powder broth. (Yes, I indulged and slurped some broth by itself - don't judge me.)Khao soi, which is my favorite Thai dish and was the main reason for visiting Pok Pok, was surprisingly mediocre. The chicken was perfectly cooked and fall-off-the-bone-with-a-chopstick-nudge tender but had absorbed none of the flavor of the curry. The noodles were a tad undercooked and the accoutrements were far from fresh (e.g. the pickled items were mushy and lacked crunch).

I have never wanted to go - for I couldn't imagine an evening meal that was comprised of a bowl of soup (even if the best in the city) only. Oh my goodness was I wrong - this place is fantastic. And, believe you me - it is so much more than a great place for the best Minestrone soup in the city (it is the best by the way).We walked in at 5 pm on a Friday night without a reservation (we have a three year old). The host was so nice and made a special concession to accommodate our table of four. We had a terrific meal that started with an appetizer of clams. Really well done. Everyone at the table ordered pasta dishes (of course my wife got the Minestrone soup). [A word of note - they have two kinds of Gluten Free pasta. It is not noted on the menu, so make certain to ask the server.] The dishes (from the spaghetti with meatballs to the pasta carbonara were really well prepared. The stand out dish was ordered for our daughter - needless-to-say, at three years old she had a few bites and then left the plate for me to consume. Her pasta pomodoro was fresh, authentic, and really delightful. By far the best dish on our table.The restaurant has a wine list, although the selection is a bit \\"off\\" from my likings. You can grab a good glass - but if you are going to drink a bottle - pay the corkage fee and bring your own.Finally, the service was really excellent. The staff were attentive, polite to our \\"three year old table\\" nuances, and very considerate to get us into a busy restaurant on a Friday night. Roma Ristorante is not a high end restaurant.

We tried to go a few nights ago albeit without a reservation and they were able to rearrange some tables to get us seated.

The tables next to us that could have been combined stayed open for at least 20-30 more minutes and I should mention this was at around 845 and the restaurant closed at 9:30 PM. We also noticed there were four people seated next to us with two tables combined together and they stayed for at least 45 minutes just BS'ing amongst themselves. However we noticed that parties that were seated after us had received water and bread and in fact meals before we even got silverware and water. We had to actually flag down an employee to even get some water and bread. Our server (a male) eventually came over and took our orders but only after spending a good 5 minutes blatantly flirting with women wearing very short and revealing dresses. I then caught him continuing this behavior after taking our order but before going inside to actually place the order. We were treated as if we didn't matter. We ended up being at the restaurant for nearly 2 hours and all we got was water and bread. I should also mention that we were not the only party frustrated with the amount of time it took to get seated, I overheard another group saying they had to wait almost an hour as well.

The vegetable to rice ratio was too heavy on the rice side in their Adventure Bowl...you are basically eating a large portion of rice with a handful of vegs on top...and the vegetables were smoothered in too much sauce.  Very crowded (over 20 min line to even place your order) & noisy and no where to sit -- people had to stand up eating their meal.  This location is more of a take out or fast food type of atmosphere than sit down dining.Nothing on their menu was labeled as gluten free except a few sauces so it was very cumbersome trying to order something as you had to go through every ingredient in a dish asking how it was prepared to make sure it was gluten free -- the person taking the order wasn't informed so they had to stop and ask someone else if something was gluten free.   Most infuriating was the snide comment she made \\"are you allergic or something ... is that why you are asking about whether the items are gluten free?\\"  to which I had to reply that yes -- I get very sick if I eat gluten so I have to be careful.  She could have chosen her words more carefully (or had a bit less of an attitude because I was taking longer than normal to get my order in because of so many questions).   I was aware that I was holding up the line by asking questions, but maybe if their menu clearly listed what dishes were gluten free then I wouldn't have to go through the ingredient list one by one to make sure I didn't get sick.Only way I'd go here again is to do take away and then tell them to cut down the amount of rice they put in their bowls & put the sauce on the side.  I've been a vegetarian for over 40 years and this place isn't anything special -- I guess if you're a meat eater, then it opens up a whole new world for you, but for me it was barely tolerable.   I like the taste of vegetables ... for people that aren't vegetarians they probably like the fact that the vegetables are covered in so much sauce that you can barely taste what vegetable you're eating...all you're tasting is the sauce.   For me, not so much.  I ate about 1/4 of the dish and took the rest home -- I'll add more vegetables myself to make it a good dish to eat.\\nThe only good part of the meal was the Elvis smoothie."},{"name":"Brothers Kouzina","address":"25 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"Excellent, friendly service.

Its huge, a full city block, much of it multiple floors. With great selections in every catagory I could imagine.    I have been in bookstores smaller then their sci-fi or travel sections. Maybe that is why they are still here when so many others have closed. The experience:  Powell's has a great selection of both new and used books.

I'm rating this place based on thai restaurants i have experienced... and I love thai food! We ordered the wings, half a chicken, side of sticky rice, boars shoulder, and catfish laab. Wings: I expect wings to come piping hot and it wasnt...that was kind of a let down. It was marinated nicely so it was full of flavor all the way into the meat. The only thing is, the glaze on the outside was a little too salty...for those of you drinking it may have been perfect. Half chicken: OMG this was really good... the chicken was moist and the smoky flavor of the charcoal was awesome! It reminded me of a thai version of a Mexican chicken joint called el pollo norte√±o..if you are ever in California   that chicken is bomb too! (P.s. i wouldnt get the sticky rice here...it was dry...)Boar: The meat itself was nothing special but the sauce on top..yum! The spicy,tangy, and garlicness is addicting! It is similar to a thai dish I love that is made with raw shrimp with the same kind of sauce. Catfish laab: this was a pleasant surprise... it is dry compared to what I'm used to when I order pork or chicken laab. The good thing about it being dry is that the roasted rice was still a little crispy and gave the dish a nice texture!

All were fairly solid and an interesting Thai/Pan-Asian fusion style mix with western influences. We washed everything down with some Vietnamese coffees, cha yen (Thai iced tea with condensed milk), and whiskey soda float.I was more than satisfied with the overall dining experience and family style dinner at Pok Pok.

I didn't bother checking Yelp because the decision had been made. To say I was non-plussed would be an understatement.  \\"Upscale meets casual\\" indeed. The prices are upscale and everything else is just a bit familiar. You'd be better off at TGI Friday's or something. This is an example of a place that clearly is trying to be \\"elevated\\" but is just nothing more than your standard bar and grill wrapped up in a few half-hearted bistro touches.This place would be a one-star rating aside from two things; my aunt enjoyed her meal for the most part and the waitress, Glenda, was super-pleasant and worked her butt off to make everything OK. But it took forever to get bread (the busboy/breadboy seemed a bit like a hot mess). The manager who ran the food was devoid of personality, and he dragged his cheap, used car salesman sport coat through my aunt's bread and butter and various other plates on the table (seriously dude? Button that ugly thing or don't wear it). The ambiance was a lame attempt at \\"bistro\\" but was more a low-budget attempt at dressing up a hotel bar. The french onion soup, or as they call it, Onion Soup Gratinee, wasn't much better than the Lipton stuff from the box. The stock was weak and watered down, the onions really didn't have much going on, they were more flavorless than savory and the crouton in the soup had a rubbery texture of a piece of Wonder Bread that was nuked for too long. Moreover, it was clear the soup sat on the line for a while. Rather than coating the whole top, it was a brown mess with a little cheese island floating in the middle. The rest of the cheese was petrified around the crock. Next up, Parmesan Crusted Chicken with Risotto (along with a vegetable medley). The chicken's breading was burnt and dry without a hint of parmesan to be tasted. The vegetables looked like they'd seen much better days, sort of like they were sitting around drying out under a light. But the worst offense was the risotto.Let me make one thing clear to all the would-be restauranteurs of the world. Risotto is not an easy dish to get right unless you really know what you're doing. If you can't do it, don't put it on the menu. Spare your guests the disappointment of your sad attempts. Risotto should be creamy and soft to gently al dente. One Bistro's looked like a mound of Uncle Ben's on the plate. The seasoning was OK, but it didn't matter because this risotto's consistency was so inconsistent, ranging from gummy to just plain hard, that it was inedible. Suffice to say two hours later, I left hungry. Do yourself a favor. Just stay away."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food!

Really.Well... I guess I was a fan until they recently started this price increase on all used books.  Before, someone simply wrote what they thought was a reasonable, yet profitable, price in the inside cover or first page in soft pencil.  The more damaged the book, the smaller the penciled in price would be.  So it was fun to rummage through the shelves to find the most fucked up book and pay the least.... I'm cheap, what can I say?Now, every used book is $4.95 regardless of condition.  And there is no more flowing pencil script letting me know the price.  Instead, there is a bright, white semi-gloss sticker on the back of the book that reeks of sterility and a desire to be a bit more like Barnes & Noble telling me what the price is ($4.95).I'm disappointed in you, Powell's.  You've gone corporate.  You've sold out.  You're not the cool, edgy, punk rock, street tough you used to be.

Unfortunately, this one was a miss for me. The pasta itself was fine, and same as the sauce, but the merging of braised short rib with lobster didn't do it for me. Not only did the dish not balance well, it was overall a disappointment in terms of flavour an innovation. I wish I had gotten something else, as I saw everyone else's food - especially given the price of this dish. Definitely not worth the price tag on it - even when you consider the ingredients. (1.5/5)Overall, I'd say ICOB is a good place to go for a semi-casual, albeit expensive, dinner. I felt that considering the prices, the food and dishes were not worth it. Maybe it's just the location making it more expensive?"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Healthy guilt-free food that's delicious.

I'm used to seeing photos of Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra, and instead I see Luca Toni and Fabio Cannavaro on the TV screen.This \\"Italian\\" experience is a serious departure from the Italian-American experience I'm used to, like \\"Mex\\" without the \\"Tex.\\" Someday I hope we get to the point where every kind of ethnic food in America turns into an American bastardization of itself and then suddenly bumps up against a more authentic version. It's my very special American dream.Anyway, I had the gnocchi with prosciutto and a cream sauce, and it was outstanding. The staff was friendly and attentive, and our waiter addressed me as \\"my friend,\\" but not in an annoying, presidential candidate way, but in an \\"if it weren't for your red hair and complete inability to speak my language, I might confuse you for a countryman\\" sort of way. It was nice.I have to complain a little about the price, though, and that knocks a star off. I mean, usually when I go to a restaurant decorated with sports jerseys, I don't expect to pay so much.

The Big Man ordered the same thing and we shared some 'library fries'. Those were kind of disappointing BC there were 7 or 8 small wedges. This hardly can be a full order...We sampled some of the famous house made ketchup. Eh! It was okay. It tasted like tomato paste with some cloves, and it was served stone cold. I make a mean yellow tomato ketchup and so I would avoid this next time. Coffee was Stumptown, thus predictable. OJ was supposedly fresh squeezed. I have my doubts. Still, a cozy little spot with some amazing sounding selections. Next time I am going to try their quiche which sounded delightful. Apparently they pride themselves on their daily coffee cake.

I had a fairly light dinner (for me): entree (monkfish), side (broccoli) and dessert (chocolate souffle). The monkfish entree was very small, but my primary issue was the sauce that was a touch too buttery. With bread, it was okay, but alone with the completely flavorless, it was overpowering in buttery-ness. The broccoli was nothing more than steamed broccoli from a Chinese takeout place. But then again, all is forgiven here, because the menu did not say it would be anything more. Then finally there was the souffle.

Yes lobster is not the cheapest, but it is so far out of the price range of the pasta (3 pastas and change), it was not worth the money I guessI will say that if its a nice day, the line will be long, and as long as you maintain happy optimism it'll be a great time.

The waitstaff is awful. They are generally pretty rude and you can tell they do not want to be there. If you sit at an actual table you will be reminded at least 100 times by a waitress that you have to order through her. I do not mind being told once, but when you tell me I have to order through you with a snotty look on your face everytime you come by my table, it gets pretty irritating. Getting a drink at the bar is even more of a struggle. The staff is just extremely slow overall. Whenever I order food here it is pretty good, just your basic bar food. Nothing special. My favorite thing is the spinach and artichoke dip because it comes in a breadbowl which I think is awesome. The only real reason I keep going back to Cask'n Flagon is because of its close proximity to the park. I would much rather go to another bar near Fenway.

The tatertots are also a must. They have a good (not great) selection or bottled and draft beers. The variety isn't huge, but it covers all of the bases (IPAs, Porters, Stouts, Lagers....) If beer isn't your thing, they do have a full liquor bar. There's usually some sort of special going on if you're trying to get down on the cheap.The location isn't bad. The only downside is if you sit at one of the picnic tables, you can expect your ass to be sore in about 8 minutes. Look for a table with chairs if you can. Also, if you don't care for loud music, you might not be thrilled with this place.

We checked our happy hour apps and Morton's popped up so we ventured to steakhouse land.  Upon arrival, we entered the bar and grabbed a table on the spot.  The late night happy hour from 9-10 at that time was not busy at all.  The server arrived promptly immediately asked if we were tweeting each other since we had our phones out.  After a rash of jokes, we placed our drink order and glanced at the menu.There is something for everyone and the food listed is discounted at 50% off.  Prices per dish ranged from $6-$8 I believe.   The cheeseburger sliders, fries, chicken strips, crabcake sliders, and filet mignon sliders were all ordered for our table.  The ambiance is very calm with a couple of other people in the area keeping to themselves and relaxing.  The food arrived and I was amazed by the portion size and how well presented the food was.  The fries arrive in a tall basket so I couldn't help but take some food porn shots in amazement.  Family style was the way to go so we could all sample the goodness that arrived.  The cheeseburger sliders were not small by any means and with 3 of them it could have easily satisfied my hunger alone.  The fries had just the right amount of seasoning and crispness.  Not one single fry was left by the time were done.  The ketchup is house made and certainly gives a bonus zing.  The chicken is very moist, not greasy, and just the right amount of breading.  The only item that failed was the filet mignon sliders.  It looked poorly edible and hardly had any flavor.  Sure the size was prettty good but it was an item that not only was the priciest but the blandest of the bunch.  The server gave us fantastic service.  He should be a good example of what other service should be like in the city.  He joked if we just saw a performance or a play and we admitted we saw the turkish star wars performance.  He had no problem with us splitting our check when it arrived.  The beer is poured into a nicely chilled glass.

Simple math one would assume.We get our checks and I receive 2 checks with two different amounts and my friends bill was for $78 which should have been $56 (the difference/remaining amount due).Long story short. It was embarrassing because those dining around us heard your rude manager continually talking over the customers and delivering rude and unacceptable comments.  In the end, we were of course right and instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding he continued to offer insults.\\nI hate writing bad reviews however this one by far has taken a toll and future patrons need to be aware.

Island Creek isn't afraid to add flair or go bold with traditional dishes; the essence of the seafood shines through while still sparkling with innovative flavors. While the lobster roe pasta is AMAZING (a must try!!! get an early reservation before it runs out), it is quite rich, so I recommend splitting a full portion and supplementing your meal with something lighter. The mussels without the shell are a steal at the price and come swimming in a creamy cous cous risotto.

The iced coffee is just light brown flavored water.  It looks like iced tea actually.  And the tomato basil mozzarella sandwich is more terrible than I even thought something like that could be.  It's on panini bread with pesto sauce and a bunch of onions.  There was only 1 halved cherry tomato on each side of the sandwich, which meant that only a couple bites of the sandwich had tomatoes in it.  And the mozzarella was not quality buffalo mozza or anything.  It was like string cheese.  Very gross, and it didn't really taste like basil, or even pesto.  I'm sure the pesto is out of some jar and not fresh.  And the sandwich was loaded with red onions, which made that the dominating flavor of the sandwich...which is not what you're going for when you order a tomato basil mozzarella sandwich.  Oh yeah, and the sandwich came with a salad that was so heavily salted that I couldn't even eat it.  And I like salt!  But why would you salt a balsamic salad so crazy much?

I remember it clearly: I got their Thai Curry Burrito and, being only 17, glanced longingly at their draft beer list. I thought the meal was great. The atmosphere seemed so \\"college-y\\" to me, between the interesting/bizarre artwork, the prominent position of the bar, and the clientele. I made a mental note to visit often if I chose to attend Ohio State.Five years later, my outlook has changed. Now, to be blunt, I'm over it. I made infrequent journeys to the restaurant throughout my time as a student, and now as an alum, I go for happy hour or burrito night every once in a while with friends. But I guess you could say the rose-colored glasses are off. The happy hour (for me, the half-off drafts are more attractive than the margaritas) is by far the best thing this place has going for it. They do keep a consistently high-quality and varied selection of craft beers on tap, which I appreciate. However, the food has fallen to the point of what I would reluctantly call \\"mediocre\\".A rule of thumb: do not, under any circumstances, order a normal burrito on their $6 all-you-can-eat burrito night. They will give you the same proteins used in the cheaper burritos (which a particularly unpleasant waitress actually TOLD us is day-old meat), fill your tortilla 3/4 of the way up with rice, and if you order a burrito with any veggies in it, as I did yesterday, you will be sorely disappointed with the results. I literally only found three spinach leaves in my burrito. THREE. Keep in mind, this thing was 6\\" long and 6\\" wide. Come on.Safe bet: Go for happy hour, and get the Pickadippa salsa sampler if you get hungry. Their guacamole is more than passable, and they have a tasty and unusual black bean dip as well.Better yet? Get your Mexican fix at Cabo Cocina on Riverside Drive, in Dublin.

The menu is a very basic Italian menu, so if you are planning to eat here don't expect obscure flavors hidden in each dish. The wine list was not too extensive and was reasonably priced for the selection. The ambiance is slightly romantic and reminded me of a recent trip to Milan with small caf√© tables for two set close to one another.

The servers were adorably decked in denim and did everything right.  The vibe was casual but with a polished presentation.  There were so many unique items on the menu, like the delicious drinking vinegars and the gorgeously presented specials, like our whole fried serpent head fish.  Some of my favorite items were the spare ribs, pork belly, and the fish sauce wings.  I wish I had been able to snag more than one before the rest of the table got to them!There were so many unique flavors and things I'd never tried before, right down to the rice which was slightly crisp and served in individual thatched containers.

The hunk of meat was of considerable size but almost no veggies on the side. Made me wonder if I should have part of the meat to go for lunch next day.The creme brulee was too cold, while the top was too thick and too solid.

We arrived early enough so there wasn't a line and got seated upstairs. Let me tell you, this is not your typical Thai food, if you are expecting Pad Thai or Pad see eu, you better walk your butt elsewhere. This place serves some authentic northern Thai food. The flavors are very intense and I can tell they use lots of fish sauce in their cuisine. So for those that are not into intense and exotic flavors, this would not be the place for you. We ordered the chicken wings with fish sauce, Pok Pok special which was more chicken served with Jasmine rice, and Pork belly braised in Burmese curry. Everything was amazing and aromatic. I would not recommend you to kiss anyone after though because your breath will smell like onion, garlic and loads of fish sauce. The reason I gave them a 4 star and not a 5 is because our jasmine rice was served in a small bamboo container and when we opened it, there was a crushed up Kleenex on top of our rice.

Oysters and Littlenecks to start - breathtakingly refreshing, cool, briny sweet little things. High quality. The bread is soft and chewy, very moist. But the butter was sweetened instead of being salted. I recommend the diner to forgo the butter, or ask for salted butter instead. Lobster roll (succulent, springy, sweet mayo-ed lobster meat on buttered toasted brioche; rivals Neptune Oyster) and other dishes are well cooked. I noticed that the kitchen is too afraid with the salt though. The seasoning is a little bland, even though the cooking is precise and evenhanded. The potato chips, for example, tasted a hundred times better with a generous hand of salt and pepper. The cod was in DESPERATE need of more seasoning!!!!!!!!! It was perfectly fork-tenderly cooked, but underseasoned seafood = UNACCEPTABLE. They should really watch out in particular bland fish like cod or haddock, tilapia. Other than the lack of salt (it's not the Roman times, please invest in some good sea salt or whatever quality NaCl you can get your hands on), I'm very happy about my experience and am glad about the new addition."},{"name":"Mee Thai Restaurant","address":"1200 Lee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"This is the best Thai place I've ever been to.

There were hardly any red plates (mostly just sesame balls and edamame) so my friend and I had to splurge more money with the orange plates to actually eat what we came for. A little absurd. My friend made a good point that during lunch hour they only had more expensive plates out so that people pay more. Not surprised with an Asian establishment.

The service was slower than I like, but it was acceptable considering the number of orders at our table (6). My only complaint is that my twin 4 yr olds' orders weren't processed first as I requested (they were famished). The prices were pretty much in line with other establishments offering the similar menus, although the thought of spending $16 on a burger, even a damn good one, is beyond me.

POK POK is southeast asian bar food elevated to the Nth degree.POK POK was also a stop on my bucket list. we made two trips, one for lunch and then a couple days later after a thinly veiled ruse (i mean we were in the neighborhood anyway) we went back for dinner. as is so often the case, i thought the second visit was my idea till the wife admitted to dreaming about IKE's WINGS after our first visit (apparently whatever they call them in THAI sounds a lot like BRAD PITT 'cause that's what she kept moaning in her sleep).the first (long-awaited and much anticipated) bite and i'm thinking, hey, you know, these are pretty good. by the second bite i was completely obsessed with them. sweet, sour, salty and bitter (sticky might not be a flavor but it certainly added to the experience), they are AMAZING !!!MUU PAA KHAM WAAN was a dish i just had to try (and one of the reasons we went back for dinner since it's not on the lunch menu). grilled chunks of boar's collar. sliced into small enough bites to be finger food and scooped up with a little STICKY RICE (ordered separately) that helps manage the heat. this dish is fun chew but seriously spiced. loved munching the icy cold mustard greens that come as a side. the KUNG OP WUN SEN (prawns with pork belly and bean thread noodles baked in a clay pot over charcoal) was pretty good. nice smokey flavor from the charcoal, an adorable clay pot and how far wrong can you go with shrimp and pork belly ??  i thought the noodles had a rubbery, off-putting texture but the kids gobbled them up. POK POK's version is the best PAD SEE EW i've ever eaten. the difference between theirs and the couple dozen others i've tried (besides that they actually source kai-lan (CHINESE broccoli) rather than just tossing in one of the more familiar EUROPEAN varieties) is that they \\"overcook\\" theirs on a very, very high heat to get a deep, smokey burnt sugar flavor.we also tried the KAENG HUNG LAH, a dry (coconut dairy-less) pork shoulder and belly curry with JASMINE RICE (ordered separately) -- really delicious.also had one of the drink specials, a MANGO ALEXANDER -- coconut cream and mango infused vodka concoction. OMG. glad i was driving or i would have indulged in several more of those bad boys ...been home from PORKLAND for more than a week but IKE's WINGS still haunt my dreams -- and, i know i'm not alone. last night i heard the wife moaning that thing that sounds suspiciously like BRAD PITT again."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been here only one time.

She was knowledgeable, playful and patient with our birthday party for our friend.  She did a much better job of explaining the difference between wet and dry aged steaks than I did even though my friends asked me.  I was pontificating and was somewhat correct, but she was much more accurate. She also provided us with great wine selections that complimented our food wonderfully.  I can not speak more highly of her.  I gave her a 30% tip and feel like I got the better of the deal!The food was outstanding.  We got a bunch of apps.  The seafood tower in wonderful and worth it for sharing.  However, I must warn you, since it is at the beginning of the evening, it is like ordering a pizza with a group of sober people....no one wants to eat the last slice; everyone is polite.  Oysters were great, if small and the shrimp were as big as a baby's arm.  If you drink enough wine, there will be fisticuffs over the giant crab legs!  My one complaint was the escargot.  They are served in a dish that is not \\"escargot friendly.\\"  They should use the \\"snail wells\\" that other restaurants use.  Oh, I just remembered...get the thick cut bacon.  They should serve it as a desert, it is that good!I got the Dry aged cowboy ribeye ($82.00!) but worth every penny!  It was hands down the best steak I have ever eaten.  I was so amazed, that I don't even know what or if my table mates got to eat!  Usually we share (\\"here, try my filet\\" kind of stuff) but I was so engrossed in my steak that the world disappeared.  Sides:  I loved the scalloped sweet potatoes!  The garlic spinach was above average and the other sides were unremarkable.  So much so that I can not remember what they were.  Not bad, just paled in comparison to the apps and the steak.Desserts:  The baked Alaska was great, but unfortunately, the only dessert that rang anyone's bell.  The others were just so so.

First, an experience.  Walking into Powell's can be a book worm's entire Saturday--happily spent.  While some times the amount of tourists or  the post-finals week College students selling back their books can be a bit overwhelming, the experience on the whole is positive. Second, variety. There's a wide range of different types of books, and Powell's has many topic-specific options, rather than just scraping the surface of broader interest areas.

So while for most americans, like my bf, steak is a rarely enjoyed delicacy, for me it always just reminded me of weekly eat-til-you-die family grill outs. Enter Kevin Rathbun Steak. So yes, I still prefer Rathbuns over the steakhouse, but I love both. Kevin Rathbun Steak does everything right and is probably my favorite Atl steakhouse. The service is impeccable, the wine list is lengthy and all accommodating (I think I saw bottles in the 20s, but definitely in the 30s and lots of options in the 40s), the steak is solid and the sides are the most imaginative of any american steakhouse I have been to. (If I think steakhouses are overrated and boring, creamed spinach, asparagus and twice baked potatoes just take this to the extreme). We started with oysters and they were perfect. Refreshing and light, and the gastrique that accompanied them were perfection. I wish I knew what went into it. \\nFor the entree, we ordered the dry aged steak for 2 with truffle butter, side of mushrooms and the scalloped sweet potatoes. Everything was very good but the scalloped sweet potatoes were the star of the meal. I would happily eat two of those and skip the steak all together (I know, I know... I'm already at the stake, holding out matches for you to start the burning). For dessert we ordered the creme br√ªl√©e, which was everything a creme br√ªl√©e should ever be- silky sweet custard with the perfect layer of smoky, caramelized sugar. Drinks- I had a champagne cocktail at the bar that was very good (and props to the bartender for asking if I wanted sparkling wine or champagne, instead of automatically going for the upcharge). The wine selection, as mentioned, was also excellent. I just wish they would add a cocktail list to make ordering a little easier. Service was so impeccable that I have no words. If it weren't for this awesome team of servers, this may have been a 4 star review. Other notes- the menu has so many excellent non steak options. I was actually going to go with the carpaccio or the tartare (ok, still steak, but it's so different when it's served raw) or one of the fish options, but the bf guilt tripped me into sharing with him. Oh and the whole experience cost about 100 pp, and we didn't even go crazy with the wine.

The boar collar is perfectly cooked with the right amount of char and amazing flavor. The drinks are amazing - different, complex and flavorful. The reason why Pok Pok loses 2 stars is because it's simply an establishment that doesn't care about its customers, but rather just its customers' money. I don't even want to go into the details of this because when I do, I just start disliking Pok Pok more and more. I'm definitely going back, hopefully on less busy night, and try some more dishes.

The staff are very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and will gladly tell you their favorite dish. I also enjoy Pok Pok because I always seem to make friends with whoever is sitting beside me at the next table whether it be a seemingly conservative family or a young betty-page pinup type.  Wait Time: NOT one of my favorite places when it comes to the wait (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but it's still worth it.

It's kind of tough to maneuver around the large wooden bar. There are a few tables beyond the bar by the kitchen, but the social crowd lingers around the bar.The scene is filled with polo shirts, Sperry shoes, and pastels...even after dark.

I should have planned a full day around wandering the shelves and exploring each section in detail. Even so, my partner was scared by the huge stack of books I eventually brought to the checkout, and I could barely fit all the books into my suitcase. For a bookstore, size does matter. I found so many obscure titles and editions I would never have been able to find at another bookstore, let alone online! The drawback with Amazon shopping is you have to know what you're looking for.

Knowing that this place was coming in to the former Azul location (sorry Shuck Shack), my wife and I made a treck to their Tribeca location the last time we were in New York City.  We wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  And fuss there was.  And well deserved.  It's fantastic there and equally but differently fantastic here.This place looks a lot like the location in Tribeca, which is cool in itself.  It's like they took the experience of a bar in the middle of NYC and just packaged it up into an Austin version.  Beautiful lighting, subway tile, copper bar.  It definitely has its own personality, but it's also very obviously the little sister.  Anything that has to do with New York, I'm a fan of.  Except the Yankees.One of the best first impressions of a cocktail bar is its menu.  I rarely order from a cocktail menu because they usually suck.  This is an exception.  On our first visit (I say \\"first\\" because barring Armageddon or getting hit by a bus, we will be back), I had two whiskey cocktails chosen from the menu.  My wife had two gin cocktails chosen from the menu.  All drinks were simply amazing, and we thoroughly enjoyed chatting with the bartenders and other patrons.There are perhaps 4 cocktail bars in Austin that really deserve to be written up.  They are, in order of appearance, East Side Show Room, 2nd/Congress, Drinkwell, and now Weather Up.  There are others that earn honorable mention, but those are the standouts in this city.

Came here for one of their daily specials, 75cent wing night. They have a mandatory $6 minimum for the deal to be in effect. It's written on the board, okay I get it. But I feel like I were a server there, j would still remind customers that the $6 minimum is necessary if you want the deal. Long story short I ended up getting a beer and a mixed drink (terrible mixed drinks, do not recommend).Wings are awesome, if you have never had twice fried Korean wings before, please do yourself a favor. Opt for Thai BBQ, you won't regret it. The spicy is a lot to handle and the soy garlic is good, but is really sweet so it was hard for me to eat a lot of those in one sitting. Wings also take a lot 45 min to make, so keep that in mind when ordering.Sushi is decent. They have their lunch specials which I've taken advantage of plenty of times. 3 rolls for $12 if I remember correctly. If you want legitimate, authentic sushi, however, I would look elsewhere. Lunch/dinner plates are decent. I've had numerous entrees and never seem to be disappointed. The prices don't match the portions. Overall, a good college neighborhood restaurant.

Of course visiting Portland for the first time, and staying so close, I had to check it out. And I'm Thai. I ordered the classic -- Grilled Chicken with somtum and sticky rice. I was impressed with the chicken. Usually, I find most Thai restaurants have a problem with the chicken being too dry. Pok Pok go the chicken part right. The somtum was also not bad. It's hard to please every palate where the somtum is concern because everyone has their own preference. In Thailand, if you order somtum, the person making it usually will ask you how you like it. So, each somtum is customized to the individual. For example, you might say 2 or 3 chilis, not too sweet nor too sour, etc. The papaya could have been pounded a bit more though. You want to sort of smash the strands down and get all the seasonings to blend in well together. But overall not bad. I don't know if it was worth the major hype, but it was not bad. Unfortunately, since I was by myself I couldn't order other dishes that I was interested in. I liked the atmosphere of the place. Reminded me of hole in the wall places in Thailand. I thought it was funny that most of the wait staff were all 'farang' (white westerners). I'm use to most Thai restaurants having Thai wait staff. Not necessarily a bad thing. Just noting the difference from what I'm use to seeing ..... and also this seems to be a Portland thing. I went into a Japanese place down the street on a different night, and also the staff -- cooks, waiters etc. -- were all farangs too!!  And they were yelling out the Welcome in Japanese at all the people entering the place!  (This is messing with my head yo! Lol!)  And this being Portland, I also noted the vinegar drink on the board and craft brews. Even in a Thai place, you're still getting that Portland twist to it. (This town is so endearing.)

Whenever I see a menu with an al nero di seppia or tinta de calamar pasta dish, I just have to have it... especially here at The Daily Catch, where the infamous black pasta stars in the center of the chalkboard menu.I ordered the appetizer portion of the homemade black pasta prepared aglio olio. Though literally translated as \\"garlic and oil,\\" the pasta aglio olio here is so much more. The perfectly al dente pasta was coated in garlicky, flavorful sauteed ground squid and glistening (but not greasy) with olive oil. The pasta itself was hand-pulled with a thickness reminiscent of udon and sharing its chewy and firm texture. SO FREAKING GOOD.We also got a small order of the fried calamari and a side of marinara sauce. You really can't go wrong with fried calamari, but the one here is pretty stellar. The crunchy batter was not too thick or grainy, the squid was fresh (the body was cut into strips and not those rubbery pre-cut frozen rings), and there were plenty of leg/tentacle pieces to fight over.Frankly, if I lived anywhere near the North End, you can bet I'd be lunching here on a daily basis. The dishes we ordered were delicious and I appreciated the no-frills atmosphere. Just remember to bring cash (and lots of it if you plan to experience the Lobster Fra Diavolo at about $75 for 2). The restaurant is a teeny, tiny shoebox that seats no more than 20 people at any given time, so plan smart - don't take your whole entourage here, just a BFF or two.

When it came time for desserts we had a Groupon that included cannolis,  they were out of them and were going ro charge us for a different dessert,  horrible. I had to literally complain with the owner so much in order to be able to get cannolis at a different time.

I am ashamed it took me so long (since their inception) to dine here.The oysters were top of the line, which is to be expected based off their namesake. One downside is there weren't any descriptions on the menu of what they would taste like, simply where they came from - so if you are a novice, be prepared to ask.I had the lobster roe noodles for my entree - wowzers. Slow cooked short rib, perfectly poached lobster, crunchy asparagus, earthy mushrooms, and perfectly cooked pasta. It was a party in my mouth. Both my wife, and her friend opined that it was a little oily - FYI - but I didn't find that to detract from the dish at all.My pre-dinner old fashioned was made perfectly, but the wine list ran pretty expensive IMO - so maybe stick to cocktails. I had a Sumatra slow drip coffee at dessert, which was extremely bold and had zero bitterness - the perfect cup. The presentation of it was also really cool as it came out in a beaker type thing, with the filter and all. Our service was a little slow/spotty, but they were all extremely nice - which made up for it. And the atmosphere here is off the charts; there aren't many places like it.

I cannot thank the servers and bartenders enough for such an entertaining experience, and spot on cocktails. I have to say that who ever is in the kitchen does an awesome job as well.  Fabio, Steve, and Skip (I believe it was) were just delightful company, with awesome personality and hospitality skills. The decor here is pretty modern sports bar in my opinion, but the food certainly isn't anywhere near the run-of-the-mill bar food you'd expect by looking at the name of the place. The restaurant and bar were impeccably clean as well as the floors. I will admit that a large part of this review is about the cocktails. I tried I believe 4 different Martinis and my fiance drank his usual beer of the season.  I cannot rave enough about how absolutely tasty, and perfectly crafted they were. All of the little elements like house made, and infused simple syrups to simple garnish and being carefully served. The bartenders here were really impressive and fun!1) Pear Martini\\n2) Ginger Martini\\n3) Lavender Martinin\\n4) Specially crafted Ginger and Lavender Martini (at my request )Mussels: These guys came out piping hot and steamy with a side of perfectly toasted garlic toast. Plump, sweet, and full of flavor, the mussels were served with tomato, corn, onion, and a really good wine sauce. I think it took us all of 5 minutes to scarf down every last one of them. Truth be told, I probably could have eaten another order of them, and can promise that there will be a repeat order on my next visit. Jambalaya:  Absolutely delicious! I personally hadn't ever had Jambalaya as I tend to be a Paella kind of chick, but we certainly weren't disappointed. Their Jambalaya has amazingly bold flavor, medium heat, and a good amount of meat. I really liked the sausage that was in this dish, and was happy with a successful food adventure.  Our server sent our food out already split for us, which gets these guys a high five for paying attention to detail."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I won't lie and say this is the best, most fun bar in Boston, but it is a must stop for any Boston Sports Fan.Consider this, you can type \\"Cask\\" into a Google search and the first hit is the Cask'n Flagon home page... and it's not sponsored.  Cask is simply synonymous with Boston sports, more specifically the Red Sox.  I wouldn't recommend going for much else, but during a game it will make you feel as though you are in Fenway Park, and you'll have the jump on the hundreds of fans that will flood it post game.Cask also offers a cheesy little dance floor in the back room that they named \\"Oliver's Nightclub\\" as a tribute to the original bar.

The place was surprisingly empty at that time, but rest assured the masses filled in soon after.  Not over crowded, but a fun atmosphere.  The waitstaff was prompt and professional, what you expect from a Rathbun restaurant.We started with the Lobster Fritters & Pimento Stuffed Bacon Puffs, both were delicious, (Breaking Story: warm cheese and bacon is good, in other news, water is wet).  My girlfriend and I spilt the Dry Aged Steak for 2, and it was amazing.  It was plenty for the both of us and the biggest surprise was the price.  It came to under $80 for the entree, which meant less than $40 a steak which is less than I was expecting.We were there celebrating my birthday and right on cue, they brought a dessert with a candle on top sans the singing (thank the sweet baby Jesus) and it was the perfect little cherry on top to end the night.To Recap:The Good:  The food, the service, the atmosphere.  Everything was met expectations of a good steakhouse.  Steakhouses are not my first choice for a night out, but when I go I prefer Rathbun's.  Stay hungry my friend.The Bad:  I love the fact Mr. Rathbun is doing well enough to open another restaurant, I loathe the fact they have almost the exact same name and are three blocks down from one another.  A couple that was meeting us, went to the other one first.  At least it was a short drive over to the right restaurant.

In my opinion, it's hard to make a fish taste spectacular ... it's really about the sauce. And the sauce definitely wasn't anything memorable. It wasn't bad either, though.

On my most recent visit, I was able to hang out in the fiction area while my boyfriend perused the car section, and we just met up when we were done.\\n5. I love that they have a coffee shop.

The main focus is the sushi but there are other asian/american food items in between(fried rice, salads, skewers, teriyaki, tofu, noodles, soups, hibachi made to order, and even a section for desert). The place is big and has plenty of seating. I had Spicy tuna roll and California roll and they were ok. What I liked about the Spicy tuna roll was that it wasnt the typical kind you would find at Tanaka, Sake, or even Hashiguchi Jr. It had regular tuna and avacado on the inside. On the outside rice, there was red chili pepper sprinkled on and scallions mixed in with the rice. Only downside is the price is rather high. I went on a Sunday for lunch and the bill was roughly $19 before tax and tip. Id imagine dinner is at least $25. On the weekdays, the lunch is $15.95. Kinda lame that they charge differently like that.

The atmosphere in this restaurant is beautiful with tables spread far enough apart that you don't feel like you are sitting on top of one another. Tableside service was excellent.  Our server was very knowledgable about the dishes and the wines.  My friends like sweeter wines, while my wife and I like dry wines.  Our server made an excellent suggestion for my friends and they were very pleased with the choice.  I like to start the meal off with the Antipasto plate.  This comes with a mix of cheeses, roasted vegetable, crimini onions with parmesan cheese.  The bread served with the meal is warm and fresh and there is an olive oil dipping sauce with roasted red peppers, that is very good.For my main course, I like to have the Lamb Lollipops with mushroom polenta.  There is also a fig demi glace that finishes the dish off.  I've had this dish 4 times and it is consistently good every time.  The lamb is done just perfectly and you get enough to fill you up [even though it  is listed as a small plate].  My wife had the Luce Bolognese and I tried it.  WOW, it was fantastic.  I may have to break out and try something different next time I go there.  After we finished our meal, we stayed talking and our server came by to refill out water glasses.  We never felt like we were being rushed out so that they could seat someone else.  All--in-all, I would rate Luce as one of the top restaurants in the Columbus Area.

No more. I WANT to love this place but I can't . Especially this location. The service is super slow despite not being very busy.The portions are pinched. I got the black bean brown rice burrito. That is like the two cheapest things in the world. Why are they charging $8 for a burrito that is smaller than a Reser's. My husband's food was so bad he wouldn't eat it. The potatoes were stone cold and very under cooked. They forgot his salsa and sour creme. He had to flag the server down twice to get it. He sent his plate back to get some warm food and they microwaved his food. Sorry Cup & Saucer. Portland has way too many food options to settle for poor slow service, undercooked pinched portions, and a restaurant space that is creepy. If you are thinking about going to this location, save your money and go across the street to Laughing Planet where the portions are better, cheaper, and the restaurant space is enjoyable.

It was even better with the side of dressing/sauce I got. I would definitely recommend getting a dressing on the side to dip it in. It was good the next day too. The inside of the restaurant did look dull and draining when I went in to pick up my order. The side of BBQ jackfruit had a kick (I am sensitive to spicy food). There were more kidney beans than jack fruit FYI the ratio seemed a little off.  Overall great healthy post workout meal I didn't feel terrible eating.

Order two or three depending on how hungry you are (and consult with the server to determine the size of the dish). My very favorite things on the menu are the Tortilla Espanola (basically a potato omelette, super good) and the Espinicas (spinach with figs and honey - magical). Those two tapas are pretty much enough for me... and then of course I sample everything my friends order. That's the fun of tapas. The sangria here is really good. It's a little sweeter than some places (like Hawaiian Punch meets red wine). Anyway, I can drink buckets of the stuff (not really).Service on the restaurant side is much, much better than on the flamenco lounge side.

When I heard MF was back in Atlanta, my husband and I were ecstatic. We went for lunch last Saturday and were one of like 3 tables i.e.. the restaurant was fairly empty. I ordered a combo lunch but after a very long time, I only received a piece of salmon -- literally -- on a plate. I asked the waiter where were the other items and he was like oh yes there are other things that come with it. So my husband got his sushi (which was excellent) while I was still waiting on my meal. The teriyaki salmon I ordered was overcooked (tough to cut or chew) and I got the rice, soup, and salad all separately after I got the salmon -- with the salad coming last.  The server was friendly but seemed unfamiliar with the menu, the sushi was very good, and the decor is amazing, however, the service -- as in the past was painstakingly slow -- especially considering there were at least 5 sushi chefs standing around. Oh yes, even with all of that help, somehow my hand roll order got lost. I had hoped the owners would've learned from the Buckhead venture that $18+ sushi rolls are tough to swallow -- especially now in Inman Park, where you can get good sushi at Zuma at reasonable prices. Why not just keep the Midtown menu you had before? So we ended up paying over $50 for lunch -- for 2 lunch \\"specials\\" and a hand roll, with water. The last burn at the end was they didn't validate parking, so that was another $5 pp since we drove separately. On my way out I also noticed the hostess standing on the bar barefoot reaching for something on a shelf. Eww. I want to support these guys and may give it another try but I'd wait a few months until they work out the kinks.

Our order was taken - I had the mini ahi tuna tacos and she got the enchiladas de mole - remarking that it is some of the best mole she has tasted. My mini tacos were the perfect size for a quick bite, had a decent amount of tuna and were resting on top of individual dollops of guacamole. Unfortunately there were too many onions so it overwhelmed the rest of the dish. The food came out super fast and a few minutes later our server checked in on us and then seemingly disappeared. Our drinks ran out and my friend wanted to order dessert - we figured he must have been busy with other tables in another section. He was nice enough - just slow moving to come back to us.

However, eating at the French restaurants in town, I did learn what bisque was.I say all this to make a point. You do not have to \\"know\\" biscuits and gravy to appreciate the excellence of Dilly Deli's biscuits and gravy. Their gravy transcends gravy. It is sausage bisque. Add a dollop of sherry and a sprig of marjoram, and it could be served before the fish in \\"America's finest restaurants\\". This gravy has never met corn starch. It is cream reduction all the way down to its sausage dripping soul. The black pepper is fresh ground, and applied as perfectly as it was in their fried chicken breading.

And you literally have to walk into the kitchen to use the bathroom, which feels more like a closet.The food itself was hit or miss.

Plus, a friend very into Thai food spoke of disappointing experiences. So maybe I came in with more reasonable expectations than some. Still, I get why this place has the reputation and crowds - the food was delicious, some great, and the atmosphere and staff are excellent.\\nFirst, the setup looks like something that evolved and grew over time, like a food truck turned shanty turned patio-built-over-nearby-tables, etc. It's very cool. We were lucky enough to go on the right day at the right time (midday), and didn't have to wait to sit at the knee wall.\\nWe sampled just two dishes, and decided to try to Thai basic drinking vinegar. Man, that stuff is addictive. No wonder they bottle it. And the coconut water they serve is a great but simple thing.\\nWe ordered the Laap Pet Isaan, made with duck skin & liver, and served with sticky rice as recommended, along with a plate of herbs and veg. This seemed a little like the better-known larb or laab salad, usually made with beef and eaten with cabbage or lettuce leaves. It was far and away the favorite of the two dishes we had; spicy, beautifully balanced and complex flavors I think of when I think of Thai food. The toasted, ground rice, the fresh herbs, the bright flavors - it all came together beautifully. (If you try this, don't make the mistake of leaving any of the green stuff on the plate; it's not decoration but an essential component of the dish.) Magic.\\nWe also got the Kaeng Hang Leh, a Northern dish with pork belly & shoulder, spices and a curry. It wasn't as successful, and came off as kind of one-note next to the other dish...more a comfort food stew, a bit sweet, but the flavors melded together. No doubt that's the point - but we weren't as thrilled by it.\\nYet there's no question these dishes are loyal to traditional Thai cooking and represent different regions. It's kind of an immersive experience, eating at Pok Pok - and that's probably a big part of its runaway success.

It is not Starbucks. It is not Dunkin Donuts. It is not a quick fix for milk and sugar laden coffee, slightly better than Folgers, as you rush to some other destination.For that matter, Lineage in its present form is not a fine espresso caffe combined with custom roaster in the mold of Chicago's Intelligentsia. It is not focused on multi-origin, blended espresso roasts, where beans are sourced throughout the year to maintain a relatively consistent flavor profile in a blended roast. It does not even have an espresso machine behind the counter at present.So why five stars? Because what Lineage does, it is doing exactly right, and it will only get better the longer this business is around and supported.Lineage is a craft roaster of mostly seasonal, fresh, single-origin coffees. They are the first roaster in Orlando that I have ever found that understands that coffee, like a fine wine, is about terroir and subtleties of the flavors of the fruit. It understands that there is a science to roasting, that when combined with a passion for the bean, results in something far more subtle and beautiful than an oversized jumbo soy milk latte with pumpkin flavored sugar water added to balance its bold but burnt beans.If you want to sample Lineage's coffees, they will give you a tour of the limited but well-selected and perfectly roasted single-origin coffees with an earnest smile that shows they are there because they believe in what they're doing and have something to share with Orlando. As I mentioned earlier, they are not currently set up for espresso. They do, however, brew with French Press, Chemex, and Pour-Over methods, fresh to order. These methods are not quick, but they highlight the flavors of the beans. Kudos to them for choosing the best tasting methods over higher throughput, higher output, higher profit methods. Will I wait a bit longer for great coffee instead of good coffee? Absolutely.I had a Rwandan brewed as a pour-over, and also tried a Brazilian that they did with a Chemex on my first visit. Both were excellent. My wife, who typically adds at least a little milk to her coffee to balance out any bitter overtones, commented on how well balanced the Rwandan was with nothing added. The mark of a good roaster is bringing out the unique subtleties of a bean without brining out its off flavors, and Lineage nailed it.I've been getting my home espresso roast by mail from Ecco Caffe (before they closed), Intelligentsia, and Counter Culture for years. With some mild apprehension, I picked up a bag of Lineage's fresh Modern American Espresso Roast to try at home with my Rancilio Silvia/Mazzer Mini combo. Currently, the Modern American Espresso Roast features Columbian beans, with a light medium roast.By the third shot, I had the grind dialed in just right. Nice crema, with some dark lacing. You can smell the fruit in the aroma. The mouthfeel was not quite as thick as what I typically pull, but was substantial enough. Flavors were smooth, mild, with a natural sweetness, good acidity, and pleasantly bright fruit notes. Simple. Elegant. Not an overly complicated flavor profile, but one that hit all the right notes with none of the wrong ones.I will be shifting getting the majority of my beans to Lineage instead of from Intelligentsia or Counter Culture, who are more established and do a fantastic job in their own right. The reason? While Lineage takes a slightly different approach, they do it extremely well, and they will only get better over the years. I'd highly recommend that local restaurants who are serious about serving coffee with the same careful selection guidelines that they would their fine wine and craft beer menus should also give them a try.Orlando needs Lineage.

Unfortunately, it was about 35 degrees outside and the only seating available was in their patio. Sure, they had their infrared heaters cranked to high, but it still took a little getting used to. Anyway, on to the food.When the weather is what it was, nothing is as comforting as a pipping hot bowl of soup, so I opted for their Khao Soi with chicken. It is a mild curry soup served with egg noodles and chicken. The chicken pieces consisted of a small leg and thigh, skin on. The broth was rich and flavorful, but the rest of it was...nothing to get too excited about. And it cost $15.50. The cost, coupled with the high expectations for a place so highly regarded, left me less than satisfied.My older brother got the same Khao Soi, which he seemed satisfied with, and my younger brother ordered the half chicken dish.

Have eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants since moving to the south from South Carolina to Georgia....most were just okay!   Out of all of the places I have eaten Aloha has the WORST FRIED RICE I HAVE EVER EATEN......this is the laziest fried rice I have ever seen.  How does Aloha make a fried rice with nothing in it....no onion, no scallions, no bean sprouts, no nothing.  Just plain brown rice (see picture) with absolutely nothing in it!  The other thing that I just don't understand is why it takes Aloha 1 1/2 hours to cook and deliver the food to an office that is 5 minutes away?Oh and keep in mind I decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews.....makes me wonder where those of you that gave this place a good review have been eating.

Although I haven't been to the likes of Neptune or B&G yet, I can say that I almost have no urge to go after ICOB.  The place was packed on a Friday night.  Their drinks are extremely reasonable in price, the service is excellent.  We had to try some of the raw oysters, so we got two of each of 4 different varieties.  The cocktail sauce is worth it just in itself.  The bread and butter were excellent and I had to pull myself away from the fresh baked sourdough with the honey butter with red sea salt sprinkled on it.  We started with tuna tartare, which was excellent with the fried root chips.  (They use sustainable seafood and local products, as our waiter told us).The lobster roll gets a paragraph to itself.  Priced at about $7-8 less than other restaurants of this caliber, I expected something smaller and not as good.  This thing was a culinary gem.  The lobster was probably as tender as lobster gets, and there was a great balance of flavor and crunch with the celery.  The rosemary bun was an excellent edition and the coleslaw was extremely delicious.  I didn't even finish the fries that I exchanged out from the kettle chips this thing was so good.Dessert was also good, we got the peanut and banana frozen yogurt.  The only suggestion I would have for ICOB would be that they should reconsider the seating situation.  Because this place was so packed and we got a table that was next to the bar, people that were drinking and hanging out at the bar kept slamming into our table and the waiters and others kept brushing up against us to sneak through.  For now, you should ask for a table not  by the bar if you don't want to be disturbed constantly.I will most definitely be back to try out more of the excellent food and drinks, and bask in the success that will be ICOB."},{"name":"Kiku Japanese Steakhouse","address":"3630 Marketplace Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We had a wonderful time...our hibachi server John was excellent his skills with knives were spectacular and his sense of humor was hilarious Kiku is a show-stopping restaurant"},{"name":"Abner's Casual Dining","address":"4051 Main St","city":"Hilliard","stars":"3.5","text":"Very disappointed.

I was intrigued with the poutine dish offered here.  For those unfamiliar, this is a dish that probably originated in French part of Canada.  Its a decadent dish of fries served with hot gravy and cheese curds on top.  Since I live in Los Angeles, I don't have the opportunity to try this dish at the Burger King there.  I thought it would turn out gross, but I found myself surprisingly happy with it.  While there was the option of adding bacon bits, a sweet onion dip, and even hamburger meat, the purist in me chose the basic poutine with no other topping.  For better or worse, there is no small size for this.  There's only one portion size, and its fairly generous enough to be a meal in itself of share between a few diners.The location isn't easy to get to.  I think this is the only branch of Burger King open at Vancouver Airport as of Jan '15.  Its located in the terminals leading to US flights, and after security.I'll get into the specifics of what I thought about this dish.Poutine (description from BK website)\\nTry a poutine at BURGER KING¬Æ and experience the great taste of fresh golden fries smothered with cheese curds & piping hot gravy. The flavours melt together to create a truly Canadian favourite.  \\nApprox $5.\\nDish rating, 60%- Visually it doesn't look flattering with it being served on a plastic cassoulet-like container.  Not unsurprisingly, it looks nothing like what's advertised.\\n- Temperature is good.  It really is served piping hot, and that remained to be the case throughout the five minutes or so I enjoyed it. \\n- The fries themselves are about average, although nothing distractingly poor.  I've always found Burger King fries a bit average.  There's not a lot of crispness and crunchiness with each fry.  The presence of potato flavor is a bit mild.  The only positive is that they're not over seasoned or under seasoned with salt.  Salt was applied with restraint, and it bridged the salty flavor of the gravy nicely.\\n- The gravy works great.  I found it had a nice saltiness throughout.  The flavor reminded me of a meat stock with some sweet undertones.  This seemed to be the most dominant flavor throughout.  While certainly delicious and comfortable with the first few bites, it does become a bit more tedious towards the end.\\n- The cheese curds weren't bad either.  It had a nice sour flavor to them that was mild yet not buried by the gravy.  The texture was nicely chewy and offered welcome diversion the fi=ries and gravy.  I do wish there may have been a bit more of it.\\n- Overall its not a bad dish at all.  I think poutine is one of those things where its difficult to go wrong with as long as there aren't some exceptional missteps in cooking.Service isn't bad.  I found the counter person to be helpful and the kitchen efficient.  Without the place being busy when I visited, my food arrived less than five minutes of ordering.While I may not necessarily suggest making a dedicated cause to visit Burger King, this isn't a bad choice to get something tasty before flying out.  Not bad."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"food is fantastic and healthy,  a win-win!my Favorite dish is the Green GODDESS and the Chai alive smoothie for dessert"},{"name":"Java Monkey","address":"425 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"Yo am I starving, or did I just wolf down an AMAZING sandwich?

This wouldn't be much of an accomplishment in and of itself if the food wasn't so....unbelievably......good.  The suggestion to order as many different plates as possible and share between the table is a good one.  Hard to really recommend specific dishes simply because I loved everything, but the wings are a must-try if forced to pick only one.  And the rice itself is the best rice I've ever had, perfect in every way.  The drinks also impressed.  The drinking vinegars were unique, and the Mango Alexander, a cocktail style that isn't typically up my alley, was fantastic as either a dessert pairing or a dessert in and of itself.   I also loved the setting.  Other reviewers more observant than me pointed out that the setup of indoor-outdoor space suggested a Thai market.

I will say that the service was pretty great, which saves Mad Mex from a 1-star review.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and both our food and drinks arrived quickly.I ordered the potato taquitos for an appetizer.  The potato filling was hot, but the outside of the taquito was soft, and it made the whole thing mushy.  To be honest, it was pretty much just a longer version of a potato pierogi.  I did not taste the black beans or monterey jack cheese at all.  Very disappointing in comparison to the Pgh location's crispy and flavorful offering of this same dish.But sadly, the potato taquitos were a dream in comparison to the chickpea chili, which is described on the menu as \\"tomatillo-jalapeno based chili gone garbonzo with spanish onions, cheese and sour cream.\\"Not so much.I'll be honest, it was just a bowl of garbonzo beans and onions.  Like the taquitos, I was missing most of the advertised flavors.  The last time I had this dish (again...in Pittsburgh), it had a true chili texture with a little kick to it.  This was literally a bowl of garbonzo beans.  I couldn't finish it, and was very disappointed.The drinks were fine (Yuengling, and one of my dining companions loved her frozen margarita) and the bathrooms were clean, but none of us really enjoyed our food.So, if I do come back to this location, it will only be for drinks.

There are too many different and tasty sounding pancakes on the menu for two people to order at one sitting.My wife had the ginger pancakes with lemon curd and pronounced them \\"gingery\\" which was a compliment. I think she ordered the ginger pancakes so that I wouldn't steal bites as I don't much care for ginger. The lemon curd was nice and tart.Cooking pancakes on their grills is no easy task and the grills take up so much room on the table that its hard to read the morning paper. We were the first seating so the grill might not have been hot enough when we made the first batch of pancakes as the second batch didn't stick nearly as bad as the first batch.My wife also ordered the savory bread pudding. She liked it and thought it has a good flavor but was surprised by the whole garlic cloves. Most were small but one was fairly good sized. They were all cooked to the point that they were nice and sweet but it was still a little off-putting to find whole cloves in the bread pudding.I ordered the trucker breakfast which is your standard breakfast with biscuits and gravy added. I had the sausage gravy. The gravy was tasty but the biscuit was average at best. Neither the biscuit nor the gravy was as good as Byways Cafe in the Pearl or Screen Door a mile or so away on Burnside.They had two house made syrups. We tried the raspberry combo and it was nice and tart with a good consistency for syrup but bad for jam. (I poured it on my English muffin and got it all over my hand but it was worth it.)I had the homemade English muffin with my breakfast and it was far superior to the biscuit. I'd order the muffin again. They throw it on the flat top to crisp one side and warm it through. Tasty.I ordered my eggs over easy and they came sunny side up but they had cooked them enough that the whites weren't runny so they were OK.The biggest disappointment was the bacon. We ordered the daily special, candied bacon, and I had bacon with my breakfast. We like our bacon crisp and ordered it crisp on both dishes. While the bacon we were served wasn't limp it wasn't exactly crisp either.My wife said it probably was because they \\"candied\\" the bacon and I pointed out that we had had candied bacon at Screen Door and they managed to get it crisp.If your looking for a breakfast joint with sickly sweet syrup and jams Slappy Cakes isn't your place. The lemon curd and both house made syrups are on the tart side which we loved as too many places make their sweets too sweet. Though I guess you could add sugar at the table if you wanted your syrup sickly sweet.Service was friendly and efficient. The wait person kept my wife's coffee cup full and the food was served quickly.So its only a few little things that kept me from adding another star to my review. If you have a large family or want a fun place to go for breakfast with some other couples Slappy Cakes would be a good choice.Would I go back? Probably not but I live in the Aloha area and Slappy Cakes in in Southeast so I have to drive by a lot of good restaurants to get there.

With an unassuming store front, and only two or three metered parking spaces, and a few tables, I'm not surprised I haven't been here before. Semi off the beaten path... but as I recently found out, it's worth the trip.The pasta is cooked al dente with good flavored sauces, and plenty of it at that. For around $10 you're going to get two meals out of your order... and it's apparent that Basta Pasta knows this because they have to-go containers out on the counter ready for you to grab.If you're looking for their homemade fusilli, you need to go for dinner as it's not offered at lunch. That was okay though... the Chicken Parm over pene was just what my tummy was looking for.I am normally someone who brings lunch to work, but this place might make the small list of restaurants I'll break my habits for... my real only deterrent is the parking situation since 99.9% of the parking around there is permit only.One last note, if your meal is under $10 - you'll need the green b/c they won't take the plastic."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Eh, average chain Mexican food.

The brisket can be hit-or-miss but the other meat items are generally very good. I'm always leery of a place that cuts their brisket paper thin because they're usually trying to hide tough meat. I asked for thicker cut brisket like you'd find at a Lockhart smokehouse, and my theory was proven true. If you're a seasoned BBQ connoisseur who looks for thick bark and rendered fat you won't find that here. It's BBQ for the masses which means they trim it down to the \\"essentials\\" and give the average person what they want. Comparing Rudy's BBQ to that of the great joints in central Texas is like comparing a hot dog to a steak. But somehow just want the ease of a decent hot dog.

Here's how I break that down:Regarding your well-hyped celebrity chef owner:  I feel neutral.  Good for him for doing something unique and getting attention for it and taking it to New York and getting a writeup in the NY Times.Regarding the 2.5 hour wait to eat dinner:  I feel highly negative.  Sure, it's not totally your fault, but you control the supply of seats.  No one wants to eat at an empty restaurant, I know, but it still was not a great introduction to your establishment.  Waiting at the Whiskey Soda Lounge was some consolation, but it had the effect of pulling more time and money out of my dining party for no particularly good reason.Regarding the quality of your food, for the price:  I feel highly positive.  Our group of three vegetarians decided to split 3 of the 4 vegetarian items on the menu:  A curry with an unpronounceable name, some stir-fried fiddleheads from ferns, and a mushroom dish.   The curry was the best, with a rich coconut broth and delicious firm mushrooms and tofu.  The stir-fried fiddleheads were stir-fried fiddleheads.  The mushroom dish was very tasty, but extremely spicy.  Why was it so spicy?  I'm not sure.  If I had had a say in it, it would have been less spicy, and I would have enjoyed it more.  But I didn't have a say in it.  Also the water that was served by default had some kind of southeast Asian jungle vegetable in it.  \\"Oh good, I was always hoping someone would improve on water,\\" I thought at the time.  Still, the food was overall very good, and our total bill came to about $45 for 3 people.  Not too shabby for Portland's hippest restaurant.  (So I hear.)Regarding your decor:  I feel neutral.  Sure, it looks cool inside.  But what is the point of producing an \\"authentic\\" ethnic menu and then housing it in a typical urban hipster joint?Regarding your service:  I feel highly positive.  Our server was chatty and helpful, joking with us about some of the various food items on the menu.  His guidance really made an intimidating, often inscrutable menu much less intimidating.Regarding the physical menu itself:  I feel negative.  Complex Thai names, dietary indicators strewn about haphazardly, etc.  Even the lists of ingredients are infuriating.  Typical list:  \\"Stir-fried rice noodles with snipped lemongrass, roasted galangal, dried morel mushrooms, sorted bell peppers, slapped pork eyeballs, clipped rainbow chard, and tossed key lime leaves, in a rich yellow curry sauce.\\"  My reaction as a vegetarian, in realtime:  \\"Mmm, okay... looks good... ooh, morels, maybe I'll get this... uh what the fuck?  Ew, no.\\"  Bottom line:  putting a simple \\"V\\" or a fucking leaf icon next to non-animal dishes, like every other restaurant ever, would help clarify this menu.Regarding your vegetarian food offerings:  I feel negative.  You offer 4 vegetarian things out of a fairly large menu.  We ate three of those, and they were good.  But they were clearly tame dishes that you didn't put a lot of thought into.  One thing I hate is feeling like a second-class citizen at a restaurant because I'm vegetarian, even though it happens all the time.  It's sad that this can happen in Portland, even with its progressive values and fantastic culinary scene.Overall, Pok Pok, the quality of your food was fantastic for the price.  But I would have preferred not to wait 2+ hours for a dinner that felt like you were making reluctant concessions to my dietary preferences."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's Books is so huge, they've got multiple locations!I thought I'd be completely lost, but the fact that they had sections of the store were color coded really helped me get around.I bought a career book there that was less expensive than if I were to get it online, win!I definitely think we need more bookstores like this everywhere.

I'm probably the only person who didn't realize that the name \\"Torchy's\\" and the flame shaped wall and ceiling decorations would imply that perhaps the food hear is hot. Who knew? I didn't. I ate here about 3 times and I started to get incredibly annoyed with how hot everything was... And then it hit me. There are flames on my soda cup... And a little devil. HOLY SHIT IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW. At that moment I appreciated the tacos a little more, and I was much more accepting of the mouth numbing heat that accompanied many of the tacos.My favorites are as follows:\\nBaja Shrimp Taco\\nThe Democrat (add cabbage slaw for crunch)\\nThe DamnBP (rest in piece)Unfortunately that last one was the July special, and it will now be removed from the menu and replaced with some August-themed deliciousness. But the Damn BP was basically the healthier version of the baja shrimp taco. Instead of fried shrimp, it was achiote-grilled shrimp, and they added mangos and jalapeno tarter sauce. Outside of that, I'm relatively sure it was the same taco. It was basically heaven (except hotter... hell?) in a tortilla. The democrat with cabbage slaw is probably my all time favorite taco actually. Thus note that the tacos list above was in no particular order. The barbacoa on that thing is just so full of flavor and umph that I could probably eat a bucket of it by itself and be satisfied. The avocado just adds to the smooth richness of the meat. The cilantro and and onion bring you back down to earth with a spritely kick, and of course, the cheese is just cheese and that's awesome. And my personal preference, adding cooked cabbage slaw, adds a much needed \\"crunch\\" factor in my opinion. I hate it when tacos don't have a crunchy, crisp factor. Lettuce is fine I suppose, but cabbage just has so much more body to it and can really hold up to these tacos. Freaking good man. Freaking good. Baja shrimp is unhealthy (already points going for it there huh?) and delicious. Fried shrimp, slaw, cheese, jalapenos and onions, and cilantro, what's not to love? it's a well balanced in both the world of texture and flavor. Get one.So here's what you should order: A democrat with cabbage slaw. A baja shrimp taco, and if you feel like something without meat, get a fried avocado taco. Those things are the bomb.And don't make the mistake I made. Realize immediately that these tacos are HOT AND WILL MAKE YOUR MOUTH BURN.PS: extra cool points for torchy's because they carry dublin dr. pepper"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"My favorite bookstore ever.

Being a culinary professional, having worked in fine dining restaurants and for Walt Disney Company, my standards might be a little high for such simple and straightforward Asian restaurant. Upon walking in to a spacious, unique atmosphere, I noticed it was not busy for a Tuesday night at 6pm. First things first, if you are looking for a place with phenomenal service, knowledgeable servers, or even a server with a smile on her face, look elsewhere. Now having said that, I have been here once, and could have just gotten the shaft with this terrible server. None the less, waited about 2 minutes to be sat with literally 2 tables full in the place. Sat down to a rather irritated server who literally laughed when one of my friends asked her for pronunciation of a dish...I am of Korean decent, however I was eating here with Americans. I ordered the seafood pho. Came with tiny bay scallops and shrimp. Would have liked more scallops, but I'm a seafood lover and am hardly ever satisfied with portions. Ask for extra sprouts and basil as they literally brought one small side plate for 3 of us....ummmmm two asians are dining here and you don't think to bring a plate for each of them???  Needless to say we asked for extra garnishes for each of us, which was brought in plenty after the server gave us some attitude. The broth itself was very tasty, all proteins come in the broth already cooked. For $12 in Kissimmee, Fl, you get what you pay for. Will I be back, probably. Will I be as excited as I am on my way to momofuko, hellllllll no. But if you're looking for a quick, cheap, and filling pho craving, give it a go. *server was filling roles of hostess, server, bartender, and foodrunner. Yes, that is a lot for one person, however, the owner/manager needs to keep in mind the type of people you give all of these responsibilities. This is the face of your business.

The lady there only seemed to be nice to people she knows, to a tourist and a foreigner like me, not so much really. And the people waiting there always sneakily watched me eating. That was uncomfortable to me, I understand why they did it though. Probably they had waited too long and started to be unease.

We were about to pick another restaurant but decided to go to Mike's Pastry first.  THANK goodness we did.  Right across the street is this little hole in the wall joint, that had a long line outside of it.  We crossed the street, stood in line, and checked 'YELP' to find out why there was such a long line outside of this place.  All the reviews we read made us stay in line.  We waited in line for about 45 minutes (and this was around 1:30 p.m.).  Finally got in, ordered what a lot of the Yelp reviewers recommended -  the aglio olio aka squid ink pasta (UHMAAAAZZZING!!!!).  We also ordered calamari (very very very good), some other shrimp/scallop over linguine in a white wine sauce (also delish), and monkfish marsala (I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so this dish didn't do anything for me).  Wait is totally worth it.  However, next time I think we may consider take out if we're really hungry.Aside from the delicious, mouth watering food, the experience is a lot of fun.  The chef and the waiter are (very) Italian and we got a kick out of their camaraderie.

They used pork slices, rice and a few cut up leaves of basil and carrots.  The peanut sauce was pretty bad flavor and we ask for fish sauce instead.  My beef pho was well below my standards.  The broth was weak and flavorless.  The meat was sparse and the noodles were a wadded gob at the bottom of the bowl.

When I say the right way I mean customer service, quality of food, and the overall dining experience. I had read that Kukai just opened and overheard one of the waitresses saying it opened yesterday. For it being the second day of business it was surprising to see the restaurant so busy. In fact, reservations for tables were all booked. If you are looking to dine with a larger party make sure to call in advance. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar area which was just as nice as a table. Most bar areas feel crammed but the bar seating had plenty of room. The amount of servers was perfect for the size of the restaurant. The overall experience was very welcoming. Other workers besides our waitress checked up on our meal. Moving onto the food, the consistency of the wavy noodles was just right. My girlfriend ordered the Shoyu ramen and I had the Miso ramen. Both were great choices with different tastes. If you are looking for a ramen that is simple but still packs a lot of flavor, then the Shoyu ramen is a great choice. The Miso ramen broth was thicker and had a stronger taste because of the garlic. One thing that was different compared to other ramen joints was that Kukai offered a side of clear broth to compensate for saltiness. The clear broth comes in a mug and there is plenty of it to add and adjust the flavor of the soup. I am excited that there is another soup option other than pho close by. I hope Kukai continues to do well and gains more business."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"RUDE!

There was barely enough room to adjust the chairs to be seated.  This was bad, but we tried to have a good attitude.  Then, the insolent waiter brought us a menu and took our drink order...never saw the drinks.  My friend saw a  fancy dish served to the table next to us and told the waiter that he would like to have the same thing.  The waiter told us, \\"That?  No...that's a special dish just for them.  They are friends of the owner.  We don't have that for you.\\"  CHARMING!  We tried to suck it up and ordered some food, thinking things couldn't get worse.  Suddenly, another waiter appeared at our table.  He informed us that he needed to get wine from the shelf above our table for another patron and reached across us to get it.  We were dumbfounded, but thought maybe this was just a case of not having their normal stock up front.  NOPE!  They seated us directly below their wine store!  Yes, they expected us to \\"enjoy\\" our meal while waiters regularly came to our table, reached over our heads, and extracted bottles from above us.

Every time we come by it's super busy and we just haven't wanted to wait, but we finally got the patient to do so. We came at 7PM (there were ~a dozen people waiting) and we signed in. We ended up waiting 30 minutes to get a table for 2; ok. For appetizers, we ordered chicken karaage and takoyaki (octupus balls with bonito) (about $6 for each appetizer) and a flight of sake each ($10-11 a piece). They came out fairly quickly, beautifully plated, and everything tasted great. The chicken was crunchy on the outside, seasoned nicely, and the chicken was moist. The spicy mayo and lemon on the side were nice toppings that added a bit of zing to them. The takoyaki was slightly crispy on the outside and really soft and melt-in-your mouth on the inside, with a piece or two of tako. We both really enjoyed both of them. We also got ramen each (I got the shoyu, original style) and were quite happy with what we got as well. Mine came with mushrooms, beansprouts, and a slice of pork. The broth was rich and flavorful but not too salty, oily, or rich. I would say it was overall better than Boxer Ramen. The only gripe I have is that it's a bit overpriced. It was $12 and I got ONE slice of pork. I think if we hadn't gotten the appetizers then I probably would have still been hungry, and one piece of meat is pretty disappointing. If you're willing to wait a Long time for ramen, this place is unique and cool to check out.

Also, they have free wifi !!!"},{"name":"Olympia Pizza","address":"3205 Broadway W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great pizza! Our waitress was very friendly and service was quick.

But here's the thing, the tortillas.. it wasn't tortillas. It tasted like flour, the flour was in your hands, it was too mushy. I've been to Mexico and know this is not a tortilla.

No real apology other than offering us more queso (we had already paid for queso and eaten it). Very disappointed!"},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So awesome, food and setting were great.

In my opinion, this place ranks in the top 3 spots easily. The beef here is so soft and tasty, I cannot believe it. The unlimited veggies they give you is also a plus. Everything was very fresh and the service was superb. I just went there 2 nights ago and am planning to go again this weekend. Highly recommended!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Par for oyster bars is still pretty good.  Visited the ICOB (when the hell did such a large restaurant appear in Kenmore Square without me noticing?) on a Saturday night too late to catch dinner, but definitely early enough for the raw bar.Limited menu was actually adequate, if the goal is to eat oysters.  16-ish different oyster varieties, mostly sourced from Cape Cod or Rhode Island.  Priced between 2 and 3 dollars a piece - which puts the ICOB about par for oyster establishments not under a \\"happy hour\\" arrangement (see \\"Providence Oyster Bar,\\" Federal Hill, PVD).  All the oysters served were very fresh, though some were definitely better than others - price does not necessarily correspond with taste.  Additionally, I thought the oyster liquor was a bit saltier than at other local oyster bars - dunno if oyster liquor is supposed to be this salty, or if there's something odd about just this place.  Oysters also tended to be on the smaller side when compared to the more tony places further east in town.  Overall, however, pretty good.The win, however, are the sweet biscuits.  At $2 each, these were enormous, golden mounds of sweet bread, crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside.  Because these were so large, I had to call it a night on the oysters at a mere dozen.  Not only are these biscuits good, they'll save you cash as well!Also got the crunchy garlic crusted kingfish.  Not good.  Fish was fine, but the soy sauce-based marinade was too salty, and definitely detracted from the delicate tastes you go for when eating raw (seared) premium fish.  Fish soaks up the marinade on presentation - not much you can do to wipe it off.  Recommend that you ask for the marinade on the side as a dip.Ambiance was nice - a bit industrial chic for an oyster joint, but it seems to be the kind of place a BU student could come to charm a wiling co-ed from the Midwest.  The place reeks of new money.  Just sayin'."},{"name":"Austin Kolache & Koffee Shoppe","address":"7113 Burnet Rd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Recently I have been craving some good Kolaches and was continually disappointed by the lack of authentic pastries from most places I have found in Austin.  I read about this place and knew I need to give it a try.  I am of Czech decent who grew up eating outstanding Kolaches from local Czech bakers around where I grew up (not in Austin).  I have to say this is the best place I have found to buy them in Austin.  While they are very good, they still aren't quite as tasty as some you can get outside of Austin in West, La Grange, or some other Czech communities.  That is the only reason I dropped them to 4 instead of 5 stars is I know these can be even better.  Still, they are worth the trip if you live in Austin and I will be returning."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a review for brunch only. The wait was 25-30 min for a table, the buffet line was 10-15min and the food was lukewarm.

We found Kiku's, which as far as sushi goes was not bad, just wish they had more traditional items such as chirashi or uni.  90% of the sushi-roll menu consisted of rolls that had that sweet yucky eel sauce - and in my opinion is a waste of an otherwise good sushi roll.  We asked for hand rolls and it took forever to explain what that was to the server.  But once we were served, the food was good (sans eel sauce).  My biggest complaint was the auto added 15% tip.  I normally tip 20% or higher and most likely would have given Kiku a better review as well as our server a better tip if not for this auto-added 15% tip.  Not sure how they get away with doing this and maybe it is just an Atlanta thing.  By the way, as big and vibrant as Atlanta is, where are all the really good sushi restaurants??  Why no reviews my Yelpers'??"},{"name":"Corner Bakery Cafe","address":"9761 Great Hills Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Corner Bakery has the BEST cinnamon rolls in town.

He helped us navigate through check in, bell hop service, valet parking and gave us family friendly restaurant advice.  The Harvest Bistro was perfect for this tired, hungry family of 4.  The buffet for the children has a variety of breakfast, lunch or dinner choices for even the pickiest eater. The breakfast buffet was overwhelming with something for everyone to enjoy starting with fresh fruit, grits, made to order eggs, back , sausage, croissants, quiche, and much more.

I always get the same thing: Mi Fen Chao (rice noodles with minced pork) and taro boba tea. It's utterly delicious.
