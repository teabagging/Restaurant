I tried the jalape√±o cornbread with honey butter, the Fox Bros Burger, the Chicken Fried Ribs, Chili Mac, and Texas Fries. I would say that it was a split in terms of execution. The cornbread was very good. You could see the fresh corn kernels inside and the bread was soft, flavorful and moist. The burger was decent, but I felt the actual chopped brisket was kind of dry. The toppings on top made up for it in most bites, but it was still evident that the chopped brisket needed either some sauce or a little more fat to make it juicier. The Chicken Fried Ribs with the white bbq sauce were tasty and I would recommend those if you're dining here. Surprisingly the ribs stayed tender and moist even after frying. Very well executed in my opinion. The Texas Fries were nothing special and could have used a sauce underneath the cheese and toppings layer, as the bottom was pretty dry. I also felt that there was very little meat actually on the fries under the melted cheese. The chili Mac was interesting in flavor, almost like a smoky spaghetti sauce, that I would pass on in the future.

This classic old school place is located in downtown Portland. Parking is difficult in the immediate area, but it is very walkable and bikeable.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is straight out of another era with wooden dining booths and a cozy dark feel. You can even hang your coats on the ends of the booth. The servers are all wearing fancy clothes making for a really formal and fancy experience. There is a rather large bar area too if you want a nice cocktail and some appetizers instead.\\n\\nI opted for a nice quiet booth to begin my slow paced lunch. My meal started with the bay shrimp cocktail and a cucumber mint lemonade. Both complimented each other well, but the shrimp portion was a little small for the price. The lemonade was delicious and very well made. My main course was the Rockfish Lafitte which sounded much better than it tasted. The crab topping was scarce, and the sauce was fairly weak.\\n\\nJake's target audience was mainly older folks looking for a classic dining experience. I am sure this is a classic destination with many people expecting the same thing over and over for their visit. My visit was a little underwhelming with the food being rather basic and not a great value. It is still a really nice place for a fancy dinner - especially if you are trying to impress the in-laws!\\n\\nThis place is a solid three stars. It is a very nice place, but I cannot recommend going out of your way to visit. This is old school in the highest order, mainly for the older crowd.

All of the positive reviews and good feedback created an unsettling expectation for the food from this place. While they're known for their brunch, we ended up going for dinner since we were nearby. \\n\\nWhile the restaurant isn't the biggest, it's definitely decently sized with a good amount of tables both indoors and outdoors. We were actually pretty lucky that the wait was less than 20 minutes, especially since it was so cold outside. The host was really friendly and efficient in getting tables cleared and customers seated as soon as he could. \\n\\nAmbiance was pretty nice - I can see it being a classy and fancy date spot just from all the customers that frequent the place. After looking at the menu, we realized that most of the popular dishes were fried. And not everybody was a fan of all the various choices. \\n\\nSo we stuck with ordering the crispy fried buttermilk-battered chicken ($17). Huge portion of boneless breast and thigh with the crispy batter as well as some mashed potatoes and gravy. I think the batter is not bad if you're a fan of the Cajun cuisine. Otherwise, it can get a bit overwhelming. We were all pretty overwhelmed with the chicken after several bites - we ended up eating only the meat because nobody wanted the fried batter. It was just too much. Potatoes were tasty though. \\n\\nScreen door plate ($18) where we could choose from a combination of any veggie side or house side. We made the mistake of going with all fried-items for the plate. Not a good idea when you already have two huge pieces of fried chicken coming your way. We tried the catfish, wings, and drumsticks. And it was difficult finishing the entire plate. I have to say that the catfish was probably super tasty. Because you get the lightness of fish inside of the batter, the more salty outside goes well with the quality of the fish. My parents thought there was a slight fishiness to the dish, but I didn't taste it. I wasn't a fan of the wings or drumstick though. Batter wasn't as crispy and so the skin stuck to the chicken. Bites of the chicken were super salty and hard to swallow down. We did enjoy the cheddar chive drop biscuit. \\n\\nAnd so glad we didn't go with a fried dish for our last option. We ordered the 12 oz grilled St. Helen's ribeye for $21. This came with mashed potatoes, red wine tomato demi-glaze and topped with some poblano butter. The best dish of the nice. The potatoes underneath were creamy and rich and incredibly buttery. Loved that I could mix the potatoes with the sauce and still taste the buttery goodness of the potatoes. The meat was melt in your mouth tasty. So tender and not too salty - super glad we got to order this dish. \\n\\nPrices of the dishes are not too bad considering the amount they give you. We were just a little bummed that the chicken wasn't as good as we wanted it to taste. I guess we just aren't big fans of Cajun chicken. \\n\\ntl;dr - we didn't enjoy the chicken, but the ribeye was a nice surprise.

The buns were on the smaller side but still substantial. I wasn't QUITE as impressed with the mac & cheese. It was covered with some sort of green spice and slightly browned bacon crumbs which were both good, but overall it tasted a little dry. This could be because it was catered though.

Hailing originally from Calgary, they've recently opened a location in the Yaletown area in May with plans to open a location around Brentwood soon. \\n\\nI visited shortly after their grand opening on a sunny Saturday morning. And to be fair, this was their first weekend opening so I'm sure they were still trying to work out all of the kinks and get everyone trained. The space is quite nice and it takes advantage of the large windows that front onto Marinaside Crescent and False Creek. The interior is bright and airy but I'm not a big fan of all of the high tables that they use (not exactly comfortable).\\n\\nTheir menu is fairly extensive and I decided to order their Hog & Scallops ($21) under their Breakfast Poutine menu as well as a Hot Chocolate. Unfortunately, their machine was broken (within the first week) and were unable to get me a hot chocolate. Just a note about the name of their dishes... it's a bit deceiving so be wary. For example, this dish has the word \\"hog\\" right in the name so you might expect that some form of pork would factor heavily in the dish. But aside from the bacon lardons bits (which can be found in many of their other \\"poutine\\" dishes), there isn't any pork here.\\n\\nWhat you do get in this dish is 3 large and plump scallops, the aforementioned bacon lardons, a few pieces of Saint Cyrille cheese curds, and brown butter hollandaise all piled on top of wedge-cut herb potatoes. I originally asked for my eggs to be poached soft but they informed me that their soft poached eggs are very soft with translucent and runny whites and that their medium poached eggs are more like regular soft poached eggs... so confusing, right? \\n\\nOverall initial thoughts... pricewise, it's on the higher end of the breakfast spectrum and they definitely have some early kinks to work through including getting a hot chocolate machine that works. Service was friendly, although at times, awkward (again, possibly due to being recently opened). Maybe best to wait for a bit before coming back.\\n\\nUndeterred, we made a subsequent visit over a month later (figuring they should have their act together by this time). Unfortunately, it seemed the service here was worst than our first visit. We arrived around 9:30am and we didn't have to wait to get a table (I've heard they have some big lineups here if you show up later in the day). They seemed a bit unorganized at the front (I get it... you're busy - but a simple smile and acknowledgement would have been nice). After being seated, we were ignored for about 15 minutes while other tables around us were being served. Eventually, they took our drink orders: Hot Chocolate ($4.5) and Mango Juice ($4.75).\\n\\nWe originally tried ordering the Lobster and Shrimp Cr√™pes but we were disappointed when they told us they were all out. Strangely enough, the waitress said that they still had the poutine version (which she told us was basically the same thing but on potatoes instead of being in cr√™pes)... which didn't really make sense. I mean, if you still had lobster and shrimp available for the poutine, why can't you put it in cr√™pes?!?! We told our waitress that we'd need some more time to decide since they didn't have what we wanted. But then she kept coming back every minute and asking if we were ready yet.\\n\\nInstead, we wound up ordering the Scrambled Cr√™pes ($17) which comes with eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, spinach, asiago cheese, ajvar (roasted pepper sauce), and topped with brown butter Hollandaise sauce... basically a cr√™pe-omelette hybrid.\\n\\nWe added some Maple Bangers ($4) as a side for our cr√™pes. They were eminently better than the side of \\"fresh\\" fruit that came with my benny dish. The apple slices looked a bit sad (like they had pre-cut them and left them out too long). \\n\\nSpeaking of the benny, I ordered the Waterfowl ($19). This dish is supposed to be prepared with smoked Peking duck breast, porchini mushroom-truffle rag√ª. Just to be clear, this is nothing like \\"Peking duck\\". The smoked duck was quite tough - like chewing jerky. The fries were the best part of this dish but they could have used a bit more crispness for my liking. Also, they should rethink their decision of serving this on a croissant because it gets too soggy for the base of a benny dish.\\n\\nAfter our last visit, I have to confirm that things really haven't gotten much better and they suffer the same issues as before. The interior (while bright) has a poor layout and it feels like you're cramped even though the space looks like it should be big. Service is hit-and-miss and the food is over-hyped for the quality and execution."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Along with the food, the atmosphere and service have been great. I like this restaurant and think it's worth checking out. This is one place you'll definitely want to keep in mind to bring out-of-town guests for Southern food.\\n\\nRevival opened July 23, 2015 in downtown Decatur, just south of the square. It's located in an old house. Various rooms have been converted into dining spaces. There's a full bar with a mixologist and assorted seating areas including a string-lit covered patio. The atmosphere is charming and old-timey.\\n\\nI've heard this place described as a \\"modern\\" Southern restaurant, but I think it's more of a traditional Southern restaurant. The food is conventional. There aren't contemporary takes on the cuisine like you'd find at places like South City Kitchen and Empire State South.\\n\\nWhen we visited for dinner, appetizers and sides ranged in price from $5-13 each, entrees $14-32 each, and desserts $6-8 each. We decided to go with Revival's family-style dinner which costs $42 per person. In order to do Revival's family-style dinner, the entire table must opt in. The family-style dinner includes one entree and one dessert per person (each person must choose their entree and dessert) and the chef picks the appetizers and sides which are shared. The $42 price tag for the family-style dinner doesn't include a drink. Some entrees, such as the shrimp and rice and NY strip, have upcharges.\\n\\nHere's what we had (regular a la carte prices shown in parenthesis unless otherwise noted):\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n* Local kale salad with Georgia strawberries, Decimal Place feta, and boiled dressing ($10)\\n* Toasted deviled ham tea sandwiches ($6)\\n\\n* Revival cornbread and butter\\n\\nEntrees:\\n* (2) Revival fried chicken ($14 each)\\n* Grass-fed beef and pork meatloaf wrapped in bacon ($14)\\n* Cornmeal fried catfish with remoulade sauce ($15)\\n* (2) Wood-grilled Riverview Farms bone-in pork chop basted in \\"KG Masterpiece\\" ($23 each or $5 upcharge each when ordering family-style)\\n\\nSides:\\n* Revival mac 'n cheese\\n* Hickory-smoked local greens\\n* Green cabbage with ham hock\\n* Pencil cob grits with pepper jelly\\n* Pork fat fried potatoes\\n\\nDesserts:\\n* Triple chocolate tart with candied orange ($7)\\n* Lemon icebox pie ($7)\\n* (2) Strawberry fried pie with vanilla ice cream ($8 each)\\n* (2) Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting ($7 each)\\n\\nJust about everything at dinner was delicious.\\n\\nThe dressing in the kale salad was made with flour, milk, butter, cayenne pepper, and apple cider vinegar. It was terrific. The toasted \\"deviled\\" ham sandwiches were delectable. The cornbread, served hot out the kitchen, was buttery and pillowy soft.\\n\\nRevival's fried chicken is among the best I've tried anywhere. It has excellent seasoning and crispy batter along with tender, juicy meat. It's hard to find fried chicken much better than this. One order comes with 3 pieces.\\n\\nThe meatloaf was outstanding. It was very flavorful with an appetizing consistency. The catfish was OK. I was hoping it would be crispier. The pork chop was phenomenal. The quality of the meat was fantastic.\\n\\nOne thing I appreciated about the sides was generally, they weren't too salty nor heavy. However, none of them really stood out. If I had to pick a favorite, it'd be the cabbage. The only disappointing side was the greens which could have been enhanced with some vinegar.\\n\\nThe desserts were top-notch. Favorites among our group varied. Mine was the lemon icebox pie. It was delightfully creamy and custardy with just a hint of acidity and tartness. The strawberry fried pie was wonderful as well, served very hot.\\n\\nI tried the Chatham punch ($8). I'm not a fan of rum, but this cocktail was quite yummy.\\n\\nBrunch is served Sunday only, 10:30am to 3:00pm. When we visited for brunch, there were 10 selections priced at $6-14 each with $4 sides. There were over a half-dozen brunch cocktails ($9-12 each) as well as canned, bottled, and draft beer available.\\n\\nHere's what I had:\\n\\n* Assorted homemade baked goods (pound cake, muffin, biscuit) with honey butter and preserves (marmalade, jam) ($6)\\n* Old-fashioned warm cinnamon roll with buttermilk frosting ($9)\\n* Revival breakfast plate with local eggs, Anson Mills grits, homemade sausage, smoked Benton's bacon, and warm biscuit ($12)\\n\\nEverything at brunch was great. The baked goods and cinnamon rolls are great for sharing. Our table ordered 3 of each and shared them. The muffin was delicious. It was airy and super soft. I especially enjoyed the sweet honey butter and jam. The cinnamon roll was huge and probably my favorite brunch item. It was warm, soft, and rich. The frosting was the best part. The breakfast plate was a solid, complete breakfast with sunny-side-up (default) eggs, thick, salty slices of bacon, hearty, plump sausage, and comforting, tasty grits. I asked for a side of sawmill gravy to go with my biscuit. The biscuit and gravy was wonderful."},{"name":"Solid Ground Cafe","address":"742 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"5","text":"For $6.50, you would think this place would serve you the greatest bacon egg and cheese in the world, dipped in gold.

They offer a range of hot sauces to compliment the meal. While poutine is traditionally a greasy, heavy meal, the crisp flavorful wedges topped with well poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and bacon was a satisfying and delicious combination. They have a few dishes that feature shaved truffle so the restaurant smelled rather heavenly when we entered. I love how they serve Umbria coffee in large mugs and a large creamer for the table.

Since they couldn't make the cocktail I wanted, I ordered a basic vodka and sour (which I order all the time).  I tried it with two different flavored vodkas and both drinks were awful.  I finally resorted to straight liquor and a Coke. In my past experiences, the bartenders here cannot make a drink, and they still can't.  \\n\\nIn the past, I have not enjoyed the food here, but I was getting hungry so I ordered the pretzel which is a huge, long, loaf of pretzel bread.  And it was delicious.  However, the cheese fondue accompanying it was not.  *sigh*  It also comes with a mustard sauce which was fine, but I would have preferred the cheese.  Our food server initially started out a bit cold, but he eventually warmed up; that being said, you only get one chance to make a first impression and his wasn't good.  \\n\\nTo top it off, the garage parking next door which used to be $5 is now $8, and Cypress doesn't validate any of it.  You may as well park on the street out front if it's available and give your money to the city rather than to a private parking garage.  \\n\\nIf ownership changes, maybe I'll give Cypress a try again, but for now, there are other places I'd rather go.\\n\\nYelp100 #1"},{"name":"Odd Moe's Pizza - Tanasbourne","address":"2087 NW 185th Ave","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"Delivery time was excellent.

Blearily, I open my eyes to see spicy edamames bearing candles, chanting and swaying around my bed.  Occasionally one of them throws down a spice bomb like a firecracker, making my gut contract with fear.  Above my head, little aji-tama eggs are spinning out of control (director's note:  we also saw \\"Gravity\\" before dinner. These eggs were in orbit around my belly.).  I struggle to sit up only to find I am tied to the bed with long, tangled skeins of ramen.  I am helpless as I notice a nine month's growth in my belly.  The chanting increases and I hear the sound of hooves, pig hooves, coming closer.  My huge belly rumbles and roils under the skin and I scream but nothing comes out of my mouth......\\n\\nI wake up to find myself blessedly in my own bed, belly flat.  In delicious relief, I almost laugh at the fear I had felt only moments earlier.

I finally made it out the other day to try it out. It looks like a popular spot in Atlanta.\\n\\nWhen I went there, they had a huge outdoor area. The inside looked tiny, so they needed the outside area to cater to all the people that went there. This looks like a popular place. A ton of people were there and parking was hard to find. During busy days, you won't find parking in the lot, you would have to find street parking. \\n\\nThe menu had all your BBQ favorites: ribs, pork, brisket, etc. They also had all the traditional sides you can get at a BBQ like Mac and Cheese, Green Beans, Brunswick Stew, and others. \\n\\nThey also give you a ton of food. If you're feeling extra hungry, you can go for the Everything Plate which consists of your choice of 4 from Ribs, Wings, Pulled Pork, Chicken, and Brisket and your choice of 2 sides.\\n\\nTheir ribs tasted good. It was on the bland side though. It seemed cooked well because it melted off the bone and was easy to eat. I needed to use more sauce to lift the flavors. \\n\\nTheir wings tasted good. It had a good smoky flavor and cooked well.\\n\\nI tried their chopped brisket. I actually like brisket done this way; it makes it easier to eat. I liked the flavor of the brisket. Unlike the ribs, I don't think I needed any sauce for the brisket.\\n\\nTheir pulled pork seemed dry to me. It had a decent flavor though. I wished it wasn't dry though. \\n\\nTheir collard greens tasted okay. I didn't like the sweetness of it. I wonder if it's a regional thing or what, but I've been having these sweet collard greens lately, and I'm not a fan. \\n\\nTheir Brunswick Stew seemed sweet as well. I thought it was interesting. Unlike the collards, I actually liked the slight sweetness of the Brunswick Stew. I'm not 100% on board with it though. Perhaps it'll grow on me. \\n\\nThe Mac and Cheese tasted good. It had a creamy texture and had good cheesy flavor. \\n\\nTheir green beans had good taste too, but it seemed soggy and overdone. \\n\\nOverall, Fox Bros seems like a decent place for BBQ. I hoped my ribs had more flavor though. I guess it was overhyped for me. But I liked it enough to be a fan.

My recent experience at Tapestry left me questioning. Today was my first time visiting the establishment. My friend suggested it after a call to FB for someone to have oysters with me for dinner. I arrived from my public transport trek from Boston excited about the prospect of $1 oysters. Being a budget conscious individual who takes the bus, I specifically asked for the $1 oyster special. My first waitress said okay. I waited a while, my friend arrived and we were revisited by a gentleman. Again, I asked if the $1 oysters were available, he said, \\"typically, only in the club room, but I'll check with Chef, it should be okay. I'll see what I can do.\\" The next waitress, a different one, came to request our drink and food order. I hadn't seen the last gentleman in a while, so I inquired again for $1 oysters and placed my order for truffle pizza. She said, \\"That shouldn't be a problem, I'll be right back.\\" She returned with oyster forks for my friend and I. She didn't ask us to move to the \\"club room\\" for the $1 oysters. The pizza came first, and I inquired again. The PRIMARY reason for my trip from Waltham to Fenway by bus was to have OYSTERS. I don't have to travel that far to get $1 oysters but I was excited to try a new place. After about the 4th request, they appeared. Being in Boston and being observant has taught me to keep track of experiences in order to reduce opportunities for being taken advantage of. Hence the repeated, consistent and deliberate requests for what I wanted. I enjoyed my meal, but when the check came the first time, I was charged $36 for $12, $1 oysters. The math is wrong. I inquired with my waitress(es) calmly and described the above scenario. I was placated. It took 5 minutes but the waitress returned with  new check. The new check charged $2 additional for the pizza we order. COME ON YO!!!!!!! I'm happy to pay my fare based on my budget and what I ordered, but why you tryina play me? I returned to the front to ask for the manager only to find out that \\"they just left.\\" A nice bartender from the back offered to adjust our bill for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, I'm loyal.

The one that made me laugh out loud was called \\"The Glenn Beck\\" described as just a plain, old weiner!  Each hotdog is served on a steamed poppyseed bun unless you ask for a lettuce wrap or gluten-free wrap.  While they normally use a Vienna all-beef dog, you could opt for a tofurkey veggie dog, polish sausage or bratwurst.  Truly it took a bit to figure out what we wanted because there was so much to choose from and they seemed to have an extensive beer list, too.

The other two of us had sushi.    \\n     \\n     The restaurant was busy and service was slow.  Our wait person came over with our menus, brought us our drinks and vanished for 15 minutes.  When our wait person did take our orders, we started off with a pu-pu platter.  We went through it pretty quickly (we were hungry), except for one skewer of beef.  I was about to eat it when our wait person came over and asked if I had tasted the skewer yet.  She stated the reason she was asking was because some other customers had just ordered the pu-pu platter and had complained that the beef was bad.  I bit off a small corner of the beef skewer and quickly spit it out.  I agreed:  the meat was bad, vinegary tasting.  She apologized and took it away.  \\n... and, that was it!  There was no, \\"Hey, can I bring you something else?\\" or \\"Gee, sorry about that.  I'm not even going to charge you for it.\\"  Nope, she just quietly took the plates away, said she was sorry and that was that.  (I'm not done with this story.) \\n\\n     My two companions that had Chinese food ordered the \\"Combination Dinners\\" for $15.95 per person.  I was surprised that they both came in BENTO BOXES!!  I was expecting regular plates of food with orange chicken and sesame chicken, rice, etc., but instead they each received a bento box each with a serving of orange chicken, sesame chicken, rice, a little spring roll, one crab puff, and (get this!) a one-inch square of brownie for dessert.  Yes, I said a ONE-INCH SQUARE piece of brownie for dessert!  Oh, they also received their choice of soup with the meal but they were so darn full from that dessert they couldn't finish it.  (Yes, I'm being sarcastic.)  Needless to say, I feel like their meals were waaaaay overpriced!!\\n     I, along with one other person at our table, ordered sushi, and lots of it!  Some of our orders included spicy tuna rolls, the California rolls, a deep fried California roll, tamago, double shrimp roll (something like that -- it's not on their regular menu -- you have to order it from a \\"special\\" book), a dragon roll and one other type of roll I forgot the name of.  (Yes, that's a heck of a lot of sushi for two people but the other sushi diner at my table was a 21-yr-old that eats like a horse.)  Overall, the sushi was okay.  I've had better (Thai Orchid); and frankly, after that pu-pu platter ... yeeesh! \\n\\n     So now comes the check, and lo and behold, there on the bill was the infamous bad pu-pu platter.  I pulled my wait person aside and told her very quietly that I had no intention of paying for the appetizer.  She said I'd have to take it up with her boss.  (Uh, okaaaaay?!)\\n     So I told \\"the boss\\" up at the cash register that I had no intention of paying for the pu-pu platter because the beef was bad.  Without batting an eye, she said, \\"Ok, let me take a few dollars off for that.\\"  (Because of the lack of surprise by \\"the boss,\\" I was only left to assume that she already KNEW the beef was bad.)  She took $5 from my total bill of (drumroll please) $98!!!!!  (Yes, that's right!  I was dropping almost $100 and she took off a whopping $5 from my total bill for BAD FOOD!  Not \\"eww, I don't like that\\" food but actual BAD food!  I said, \\"Speaking of $5, I happen to have a coupon (Payback book) that'll SAVE me $5.\\"  She also gave me that $5 discount and gave me these parting words of wisdom, \\n\\n     \\"Next time this happens, let us know so that we can tell our chef that the meat is bad.\\"   (I'm sorry BUT WHAT?!?!?!?)  \\n   \\n     I don't work in the restaurant industry, and I don't pretend to know anything about it, but I do know a whole heck of a lot about cooking and baking.  (I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I'm a pretty damn good cook!)   After raising three boys (four, if you count my husband) I can say without hesitation that it is the \\"CHEF'S\\" responsibility to KNOW if something is spoiled or rotten in their OWN KITCHEN!!!  It is NOT the customer's responsibility to INFORM the chef that the food they are preparing is rotten!!  Moreso, especially when the restaurant's OWN wait staff is informing your customers that something is BAD!!! \\n     Un-be-lievable!  Next time, we're going to Thai Orchid (downtown Vancouver)."},{"name":"El Vaquero Mexican Restaurant","address":"8715 Sancus Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I have to preface this review with saying that I hate giving bad reviews. \\nMy friends and I just finished eating lunch here.  The first thing we noticed was a sign on the front door saying that the air conditioner was not working. It was not a hot day today, so I figured it would be okay and for me it was. My friends did get a little warm by the end of the meal. When we were first seated the table was very dirty it still had crumbs on it and it was difficult to move the container that had the salt and pepper and other hot sauces in it because it was so sticky. We ended up moving to a different table and actually had the same problem they are. The chips and salsa was good the drinks were delivered on time the waitress was doing her job very well well. Nothing to say bad about her I ordered the Carnitas Express, and when it arrived there was no flavor to the pork at all not even salt on it. And I was told that you were supposed to mix in the salsa and other things besides to give it flavor. I will say that the salsa on the side that had the mango and pineapple and it was excellent. I picked up the salt shaker to add it to the park and couldn't get any salt out of the Shaker due to all of the holes being clogged and I couldn't even get the top off of the salt shaker to try and fix it. I think that they need to do a heavy duty cleaning at this location. Perhaps the cooks could do with an updated training."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Our go to place for downtown dining.

Finally got the gumption to try Tatsu-Ya after hearing so much about it. Pulled into the parking lot today and... It was the same place in the exact location but with a different name. Alright, well, back then it wasn't too popular and now it's blown up so maybe they've gotten it together and the food is really good, right? Man if ONLY. This place is just as mediocre as it was five years ago and with WAY worse service. Dunno where to begin:\\n\\nFor food I had the Mi So Hot ramen and the curry bowl as a side. The curry was SUPER WEAK. I make Japanese curry with katsu at home all the time and I felt like even I could have made something better at home: bland and flavorless with tough, half-cooked veggies. The ramen wasn't horrible but not very good either: really thin and bland noodles instead of the full bodied kind you can get elsewhere and salty broth that was watery and hot but had no real flavor or thickness like tonkotsu is supposed to. Really mediocre food compared to the hype.\\n\\nAs for the service? Hoo boy. Food came out and the waitress tipped her tray while trying to get our bowls off it and spilled my ramen all over my pants. And let me say first: I've worked in food service before, I know how it is, sh*t happens, not a huge deal, etc. But all I got was a hurried \\"oh, sorry\\" as she rushed off... and then never came back for the rest of the evening. Uh, how about at least doing the courteous thing and getting me like a wet towel or something so I can clean the hot ramen that you just spilt all over my pants? I had to use my own drink and a napkin to wipe it off, then when I asked a different waitress for water, she said \\"water is self service in the back, go get it yourself\\". So to recap, let me get this straight: \\"Hey we're gonna go ahead and spill ramen all over your pants. Use your own drink and some napkins to clean it off, not our problem. Oh, you want a refill on water because of that? Get it yourself.\\" Cool, thanks guys!  \\n\\nIn closing I hate to be THAT B*TCH but I've actually lived in Japan for five years and spent a couple on the west coast (Where good Japanese food is plentiful) and if this is really the \\"best ramen in Austin\\" then this city needs to step its game up big time. But I actually already know that Tatsu Ya isn't the only show in town: not too far from here on West Anderson there's Haru Ramen which is a lot less hyped but having been to both I can say that Haru has better food (their broth options and noodles are WAY ahead of this place) and the service is better too with almost no wait time by comparison. With a better option not too far away I can see no reason I'd ever come back to this place. But hey, at least now I know I don't have to bother waiting in line listening to bad EDM to eat here again!"},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I grew up on dim sum, whether from China or in an authentic Chinese Dim Sum places around the States. And honestly, the dim sum here is pretty good compared to other places around Boston's Chinatown. Their shu mai, and shrimp dumplings were good. Their cha xiu bao's did not have enough filling + the bun was rubbery and dry. Their shrimp wraps (xia chang) were also decent, although they don't cut it for you which means you better have good chop stick skills. Overall, their food isn't TERRIBLE. It's even pretty good, depending on what you get. In terms of price it is still pricey, especially if you, like me, have had good and cheap dim sum in the past, but I feel like compared to other dim sum places in Chinatown, it is not that bad.\\n\\nBut, the only reason why I give this entire place 1-star is that their customer service is TERRIBLE. I went on a Sunday afternoon, and sure, it's a busy time to be going to get dim sum, and I get that. But, even the busiest Chinese restaurant's I've ever been too will at least smile and say hi before asking for how many people. And then, even as we had sat down, no one came to make sure we wanted tea or anything. I had to ask a passerby (manager, I believe) for tea, he looked at me, and then walked away. No acknowledgment of whether or not he even heard me. And then two minutes later he plopped the tea onto the table and walked away. By the way, this restaurant is so busy that I kept seeing people get out of their seat to just grab food from the cart and bringing their slip with them. I feel like dim sum is a family gathering, and should be viewed in similar veins as American brunch, so the fact that I wanted to leave as soon as I sat down gave me a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\nLastly... you better give them a tip, coz otherwise, they will come right back at you and won't let you leave until they get one. A waiter actually stood by me as I wrote it down. Why should I have given a tip? The service I received was abysmal and downright rude. Even if the food was 5-stars, I would never go back again, and sadly they have lost me as a customer. (Also what service did they provide? We didn't get any attention whatsoever. And it's not like we were asking for much. An acknowledgement or smile would've sufficed. Is that too much to ask for?)\\n\\nBy the way, I feel like I should justify this review by saying that as a Chinese person, I have had experiences eating dim sum in a rushed setting during peak hours. The fact that I grew up on curt Chinese customer service means that my tolerance for bad customer service is pretty high. So this entire experience was NOT OKAY for me. I don't even have to say it but I'm sure you can tell I do not recommend this place. If you must go get dim sum in Boston, go to Windsor Dim Sum. It's a block away, less seating, they are just as curt, but at least their food is better."},{"name":"Marco's Restaurant","address":"47 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"A smaller restaurant so be prepared to wait if you do not have reservations.

Mainly in our server's lack of knowledge of the drinks and not being able to explain them that well. \\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, for whatever reason I often find tropical themed places to feel a bit kitschy. Maybe it's because we're no where near a beach, I don't know. I do love being in the tropics, but tropic like bars/restaurants rarely transport me there. Anyway, there is not too much kitsch here and they balance it well with some nice decor so it has a bit of a tropical eclectic feel to it.

The Century House has always had very special sentimental meaning. Certainly not any more. \\n\\nFor starters, my mother asked if it would be OK to instead sit @ a booth in front of the window. The server was terse, rude, anything but accommodating.  Clearly she was doing some monumental favor. There goes the concept of being a \\"guest\\". Apparently the concept of customer service no longer applies @ the Century House. The server continued to be underwhelming.\\n\\nThe staff had fair questions and understandable concerns at the time of payment. I personally worked as a dining room manager many years ago.  It was not content of the concerns or questions, rather the combative approach, the insinuations of criminal behavior, the threat TO CALL THE POLICE, the stress that played out in front of a vulnerable and elderly customer with dementia, the loud and hectic embarrassment caused our most wonderful Home Health Care gal in front of the entire restaurant. \\n\\nOur Home Health Care gal took my mother to dinner this eve. Our HHC gal is a saint. I ask her to get one bill because my Mom likes to treat. Meagan being as generous as she is, got two bills instead. When she went to pay her share, she put down her cc that is a joint account with her husband, but only had her husbands name on it. Rightfully so, she was asked for ID, which in turn did not align with the name on the cc. As Meagan was discussing the two bills, and the solution, David, the \\"Manager\\" then accused her of not being willing to pay, threatened to call the police, escalating a situation that could have been easily rectified with easy dialogue. Meagan was more than willing and bale to pay, using the ATM that is right there in the building, although he didn't let her get to that. Meanwhile, Meagan's husband called the restaurant. He got nowhere. David is a poor listener. Far from ideal for a \\"manager\\". When it then came time for my Mother to pay, the server was being aggressive and pushy toward my bewildered Mom. Meagan had to step in. Meagan did not have my mothers wallet with her ID, my fault as I had failed to give it to them. The result of being an overwhelmed caregiver, low on sleep, attempting to juggle all the details and stresses of caring for an elderly parent struggling with dementia. More combative accusations came from David.\\n\\nI get it. A restaurant or business establishment can and should ask for ID. Although we all know that rarely happens. A simple effort to work together on sorting out an easy and way to pay graciously and end the evening on what was supposed to be a nice night for my sweet Mom. My mother just recently recovered from a broken hip in 5 places, non-weight bearing status for 3 months, and a very, very long winter. Her special spring outing was ruined by poor judgment and bizarre management behavior. As you can imagine someone suffering from dementia was beyond overwhelmed from the stress. Meagan was shaking when she walked in the door. A woman of four children that is a fully competent and functioning human being full of confidence was that thrown off from the treatment she received @ what was supposed to be a simple and nice night out @ the Century House. \\n\\nI called David upon their return. I asked for an explanation. Rather than explaining in a constructive manner ... look, they didn't have ID, I wasn't comfortable with it, you can understand given the fraud out there these days ... he instead was aggressive, using combative language and tone. He then lied and said Meghan did not have her ID with her. I let him finish, then as I went to respond, David interrupted, and again was combative ... exhibited every behavior contrary to management 101 basic skills. I raised my voice in an effort to not be talked over. He spoke over me louder. I eventually just hung up the phone.\\n\\nCentury House, I leave you with a few last thoughts. I have been in business for 30 years, many in management leading large teams of business professionals. David is in the wrong job. He possesses absolutely no management skills. Moreover, if the majority of your customer base is elderly, which they indeed are, some very basic education on the vulnerabilities of that age group would deem appropriate. With the large and shocking growing numbers of dementia and Alzheimer's, might I suggest you start there. \\n\\nLastly David, you might try listening. You just might learn something. \\n\\nIf this were a Saturday Night live skit it could have been funny. Funny in terms of how to treat your customers like the enemy. But it wasn't funny at all. I walked into an overwhelmed sweet Mom and a rattled HHC gal that simply attempted to go out for a nice dinner. Shame on you.

I dragged my husband out of our hotel bed so that we could get here early enough (going here was on his bucket list, but we're both evening-shifters). Was an overcast (and previously rainy) Thursday morning, and we waited 2.5 hours before eating. Not too bad, considering other reviews I've read!\\n\\nThe woman taking order estimates from the line was able to readily tell me what was gluten-free (pretty much everything except bread and espresso BBQ sauce), and she got us chairs once she was done going through the line. The line moved fairly quickly once the restaurant opened, and they took beer orders once we got inside. We got samples of burnt ends once we got close to the counter, and HOLY CRAP, we died of happiness!!\\n\\nThis was the first time for both of us, and we over-ordered on purpose. 1 lb of brisket, 1 lb of ribs, 1/4 lb of pulled pork, 1/4 links of both sausages (garlic & pepper and the seasonal fig & blue cheese), and my husband got all 3 sides. He wasn't a huge fan of the potato salad (I've spoiled him with my recipe), but he loved that the beans have brisket bits in them.\\n\\nThe brisket and the ribs were the best we've both ever had, as they were ridiculously tender and flavorful. Heaven on earth, and fully worth the wait!!! I did try the vinegar BBQ sauce on the pulled pork (with onions and pickles), and it was definitely good. I normally LOVE condiments, but the ribs and brisket were too good for sauce.\\n\\nMy husband loves to smoke meat too (and he's awesome at it), and he says that Aaron Franklin is a BBQ god! We've watched his PBS show and have wanted to go experience his food for ourselves. It is not cheap, but it tastes delicious, and he uses the best quality meats, so I don't mind dropping a small fortune for his BBQ. We also bought t-shirts and his BBQ book.

The pastries were all beautiful and delicious!\\n\\nUnfortunately, my second experience with this bakery wasn't as good.  I went in looking to buy a cake for my mom's birthday.  They had a few of the smaller sized cakes available and the girl behind the counter was very helpful in helping me pick.  They had a beautiful carrot cake, and she told me that she \\"didn't even really like carrot cake, but she loved this carrot cake,\\" it was that good.\\"  My brother is severely allergic to nuts, so before I said yes to the cake, I asked her if it contained nuts.  She didn't know, and went into the kitchen to ask the baker.  The baker said it had no nuts, so I bought it.  They offered to write a message on the cake for free, which was in chocolate and looked beautiful.\\n\\nThat night at my mom's birthday dinner, we discovered that the cute little carrots on top of the cake were made of marzipan.  One of the key ingredients in marzipan?  Almonds.  Luckily, we figured this out before my brother had a piece.  But my question is, shouldn't the baker at Cassis know that there is marzipan on top of a nut free cake?  Shouldn't the staff?  With nut allergies being pretty common, they are putting themselves in a dangerous situation by not being aware of this.  The cake itself wasn't bad, although I don't think it was amazing in any sense.  The frosting though, was really weird.  Not sweet at all with basically no flavor.  Definitely didn't contain cream cheese, which I think is a must with carrot cake.\\n\\nSo while I may go there again for their tasty little pastries, I definitely will not be buying another cake from them.  It wasn't worth the $25 it cost--even more so with the fact that a member of my family couldn't even eat it.\\n\\nI will say that I emailed Cassis about the nuts and they wrote back right away and were apologetic.

Your choice of soda, beer or wine, dessert lemon pound cake. At times during the show you couldn't eat because you were so engaged in the performance you thought you might miss something.

They sport some cool decor outside, which contains statues of icons like Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. The interior is equally well decked, with booths, pictures, and other decor. Their menu consists of various breakfast and lunch items, many of which are named after movie icons. I had their Elvis Eggs Benedict. It was fairly good, nothing mindblowing. I did find the price to be a little on the higher side. The service was good though; the food comes quite quickly and the server I had was extremely warm and friendly. All in all, while the food didn't blow me away, I think the diner is still worth checking out for the decor and service alone.\\n\\nElvis Eggs Benedict ($17.45):\\n3.5/5\\nThis contained bacon, back bacon, and turkey bacon, and is served with home fries and a cup of fresh fruit. The eggs were tender and runny; the hollandaise was quite creamy albeit a bit on the bland side. It was quite salty from all the bacon. I wasn't the biggest fan of the English muffin, which was quite tough at the bottom. The home fries were a bit soggy, but still tasty. I quite enjoyed the fruit, which came in quite a good variety, and were fairly fresh.\\n\\nSummary:\\nFood: 3.5/5\\nPrice: 3/5\\nService: 4/5\\nOverall: 3.5/5\\nRecommendations: N/A"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"GREAT PLACE!

Pickup on site but no waiting in line.  See tip below.\\n\\nHoly F***.  It quivers when spanked.  Fat end.  Juicy doesn't describe it's glistening glory.  Simply seasoned with salt and pepper, it's bark, black as night, perfect.   Deep smoke ring, at least a centimeter thick, clean oak smoke leaves ZERO astringent bitterness.  The texture, perfect.  Pull a slice and it stretches like an accordion before tearing apart.  No shredding.  Incredibly well trimmed, no silver skin, the fat so well rendered, what remains is tender and beef like, the beef itself, flavorful.  12-20 hours on the pit.  Whatever.  It's so good you'll slap yourself.\\n\\nGuts (sausage), all beef, very well seasoned.  beautiful snap from the natural casing.  Great smoky flavor, lacking any kind of bitterness.  Chunky and tasty.  One great beef sausage.\\n\\nSauce?  Haha.  Seriously?  Why mess with perfection.  Dive in with your fingers and go all primal animal.  Wow!\\n\\nTip:  Pre-order. Use the website.  Six week advanced notice required.  It sells out quick.  Prices the same as in the restaurant.  Choose your time for pickup. Five pounds minimum.  Pickup in back. No sides available.

This made my first and second experience at DeSano that much more of a pleasant surprise. Especially when learning this is a small chain (4 other US locations). They have some awesome Neapolitan pizza here which rivals my other Austin favorite, Pieous. Where Pieous seems like a blend between traditional and non traditional pies, DeSano screams full traditional to me.\\n\\nFor the carnivores, I highly recommend starting out with their San Ginnaro pizza. It's a great pizza to showcase what they offer, with layers of flavors and textures that all work so perfectly together. The fennel sausage, the creamy mozzarella di bufala, the bright acidity of the peppedews, the richness of the San Marzano tomato sauce, the perfection of the crust all make for a pretty amazing pizza. My mouth is watering just reliving the experience. I tried their Diavola too and liked it, but when stacked next to the San Ginnaro, it's not as good in my opinion. I do want to try their Margherita D.O.P. next time, which is a Neapolitan classic. It looks like a work of art too.\\n\\nAt their water station, you'll find bins of freshly grated parmesan, red pepper flakes, garlic, and more. A highlight is the Calabrian peppers which have deep almost wine like flavor along with a good amount of heat. Next to this station you have a full view of them making each and ever pizza from scratch. The service here is great and a number of people stopped by to make sure we were happy and getting everything we needed.\\n\\nI think the problem with most average to subpar pizzerias is that they skimp on one of the absolute most important components of what makes a good pizza, the quality of the ingredients. Most all ingredients DeSano uses are products of Italy and you can taste the difference. In fact they strictly follow the ingredient guidelines set by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana. They did tell me their meat products are all from Chicago, which as a Chicago native, I won't take any issue with. Chicago has some supreme quality meats.\\n\\nI am thrilled that I can now have pizza of this quality without driving for 40 mins or getting on a plane.

My coworker took me here because she wanted to verify that this place was good outside of just Texas, and damn. This place is good. Probably some of the best ramen that I've had throughout my travels. \\n\\nThis place is apparently no stranger to lines. We waited for about twenty minutes which was fine. Plus the line is pretty efficient and constantly moves forward. They basically let in a certain number of parties after an amount of time. You order and pay up front before getting seated and having the food delivered to you within minutes.\\n\\nI got the tsukemen which was good, but I definitely missed out because the #1, the tonkotsu is AMAZING. I would definitely go back for this and highly recommend anyone who goes here to get it. So many great things about it. Firstly, the soup is on point. It's not fatty (which seems to be the trend in California ramen), so nothing is detracting from its wonderful porky flavor. The noodles are skinny and al dente, but they're also chewy and bouncy at the same time--making each noodle so delightful to slurp up. THE EGG. Oh my god the egg. It's so good. It's a perfectly cooked ajitama egg. It's marinated in pork fat so the egg itself actually has flavor. The white and the yolk of the egg are both super soft and flavorful. Ah it was amazing. Make sure to get an extra egg otherwise you'll only get half a slice!\\n\\nOkay, so that was the number one which I tried and wish I got. I got the tsukemen because I haven't been able to find it in Norcal. Tsukemen was alright but it wasn't standout. The noodles are noticeably thicker and good, but they're just not as bomb as the thin ones in the #1. Tsukemen is known for having a thicker dipping soup. This soup was supposed to be tonkotsu flavored but I have to admit that it was just a little too strong for me I felt pretty overwhelmed by it about halfway through the bowl. I couldn't quite taste the tonkotsu flavor in the broth at all. Just seemed like a big heavy mess of stuff. There were a lot of flavors going on in that bowl that I wasn't able to finish it, but it was good! Just wish I got the #1 though because it was even better :)\\n\\nWe also got the brussel sprouts which were alright. Apparently they're all the hype. I thought they were fine, but no strong desire to order them. \\n\\ntldr; best ramen that I've had? strong statement to make, but I really can't think of anything I had an issue with in this bowl of ramen. pretty amazing. go for the #1 with extra egg! ajitama is the standout here."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good food and super friendly staff!

With only two non-pork broth options asking to sub something for a $3 component doesn't seem outrageous.

It was soooooo worth the wait.  This was in my top 3 things when I decided to visit Portland so I sucked it up and waited.  Fortunately Heart is a 2 minute walk away, so we killed some time there and had their wonderful coffee.  The Chicken & Waffles is easily THE BEST one I ever had.  In LA people talk about Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, but that has nothing on Screen Door.  Seriously some of the best chicken and waffles I ever had.\\n\\nWaffles are crispy on the outside, but cooked perfectly on the inside.  There's a hint of cinnamon which complements the chicken well.  I also love how the squares of the waffles are big so it holds the syrup.  The chicken is YUGE (Donald Trump voice)!  You get 3 large pieces which is fried and crisped to perfection.  Your 3 pieces are stacked and stabbed on top of your waffle with a knife.  The batter is pretty peppery which I liked, it works well with the sweetness of the syrup and the cinnamon in the waffles.  Ugh, I'm already salivating just thinking about how good that was.

This includes 2 specific starters, an entree per person, 5 specific sides, and a desert per person.  I felt like this was a little restrictive and that there was no way our group of 4 could finish 4 deserts.  Luckily, you can also order a la carte! So we did 1 starter, an entree per person, 5 sides and 2 deserts.  This was plenty for our group. \\n\\nThe food: Order the creamed corn.  After one friend tried it she announced, \\"ok everyone needs to try the corn\\" and rave reviews followed. The other sides were good - the mac and cheese comes in a little pot, the collards taste like Aunt Beverly's, and I haven't ever met a black eyed pea I didn't like. Cream corn is the clear all star side dish.  Also! Corn bread is complementary!\\nWe ordered 2 fried chickens, a quail dish and meatloaf.  While the fried chicken was everything you want fried chicken to be, I think the meatloaf was my favorite.  The quail is quite delicious as well, but small so harder to share. For a table of four - if everyone wants to try fried chicken, you really only need one order and that opens up for you to be able to try something else!\\nThe deserts are MASSIVE.  Honestly 4 people struggled through one piece of cake and one tart....ok struggle is a hard word since they were so delicious but the cake really is big. \\nWe ordered some drinks as well, the mint julep is the one that really stood out.\\n\\nThe atmosphere: The house that Revival converted off the decatur square is the perfect setting for a southern, homestyle restaurant.

With the exception of the first floor entrance, the Cowfish restaurant is located primarily on the 2nd and 3rd floor. When we walked into the Cowfish on the first floor, we immediately had to take the stairs to the 2nd floor. The restaurant has large bars on the 2nd and 3rd floor, plenty of booth seating, and a patio on the 2nd floor that overlooks all the city walk passers by! \\n\\nAt first glance, I thought the Cowfish Restaurant could have done a better job making their half cow half fish mascot that patrons can take a picture with outside the restaurant. I was surprised to learn that the CowFish is actually a real fish who's full name is the \\"longhorn cowfish\\" and is recognizable by its long horns like those of a cow. The longhorn cowfish can be found in the Indo-Pacific region which includes the seas bordering East Africa, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and Australia. \\n\\nThe CowFish features colorful Japanese inspired cartoon style zany drawings including a sumo wrestler Elvis Presley, King Kong, Godzilla, Fish, different colored Sushi rolls, a Gator Conquistador, and Japanese architecture all over its walls with random cows thrown in everywhere to represent the blending of Japanese and American cultures and foods that are represented at this restaurant. The 2nd floor bar is very futuristic looking with large vertical television displays with aquarium fish swimming around. The concierge desk on the 2nd floor features a huge noodle bowl filled with chopsticks, fake noodles, water, and the cowfish the restaurant is named after! \\n\\nThe Crab Rangoon Dip came with parmesan panko crust, wonton crisps, Thai sweet chili sauce, and chives. The wonton crisps were all curled up to resemble typical wontons and it was a bit hard to evenly spread the crab rangoon dip on them as a result. It was good but I think I prefer the original style of crab rangoon where the dip is already inside and ready to be eaten. 7/10 \\n\\nThe Firecracker Roll featured Shrimp tempura, kani inside coated with tempura flakes, topped with yellowtail, salmon, spicy mayo, masago, tobiko and scallions, served with ponzu dipping sauce. 9/10\\n\\nThe Prime Time Filet & Lobster Roll featured Lobster and cucumbers inside, topped with seared rare seasoned filet mignon, pan-fried portabella mushroom slices tossed in truffle oil, green onions and spicy mayo, served with a side of pounded ginger sauce.

There is A LOT of different combinations to choose from, and none of which you can go wrong with. They have all the typical proteins: Chorizo, Brisket, Steak, Chicken, ect.. Everyone has strong flavor that doesn't get lost within the taco. Which is good because there can be a lot going on within every taco you make. There is also a lot of choices within Cheeses, tortillas, Sauces, Salsas. There are so many different items that you can make your tacos with its hard not to have a different variation of tacos every time you come in. I'm not sure if I have made the same taco twice since I've been coming toany of the Candado's locations. Also I'd like to throw in that I recommend that you start off with the queso. It's pretty good, it's nice and creamy and not too runny or too thick. I like getting it topped with Chorizo. The chorizo has a strong flavor and adds to the queso. Although I will say that their chips are a little on the greasy side. *Side note* Their margs taste like they dont have too much alcohol in them FYI*\\n\\nI love the way they set up their ordering system. When you sit down you will find menus on paper pads where you tear one off for yourself. There are pencils available so you can write your name on your menu and fill in the bubbles of what you want like those test everyone had to take in HS lol. Once you fill that out the waiter takes your menu and they prepare your food based on what you marked you wanted. It's simple but a pretty good idea and offers something different.\\n\\nI can say that I've never really had bad service at Condado before. Everything is normally pretty quick and you get everything you need.\\n\\nEvery location of Condado is pretty colorful with art on the wall. It's a pretty hip vibe in there and they offer outside seating which is great. But be prepared to be sitting right next to strangers. You will have people right next to you because the tables are very long and you share the tables with everyone that comes. They do have a couple tables here and there that are separated and you won't have a stranger right beside you. But if you are socially comfortable it's not a big deal at all. \\n\\nCondado is very solid all around. This goes for all of their locations. If you're looking for good tacos, then don't waste time and go to the nearest one to you. I have not found one that I didn't like. Only leaving my review here because this is the last one that I've visited. 5 stars because they do everything well and nothing wrong."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"There is no much to love about this little spot.

First and foremost we got 12 pounds total- 2, 6lb trays of crawfish, 2 trays of king crabs and snow crab with 10 wings, bread, and fries. Clearly we went all out.\\nThe wings were probably the best thing I had. They were perfectly fried to a crisp and the dipping sauce was delicious. Out come the trays. Sooooo much sauce. Swimming in sauce might I add. It comes with your standard red potatoes, corn and bits of sausage. Personally, i think the sausages should have been cut into thicker slices- they way they were cut made them look like match stick carrots. Still good tho. So I went around and asked what people liked and didn't like and some of the complaints were just that the crab legs were bendy and hard to crack which (I guess) means the crabs been sitting out and old. \\nLuckily, we knew the owners of the restaurant and spoke to them about our experience and the quality. He was extremely understanding and even gave us dessert on the house. :/ I wish I could say the dessert was good but the beignets were stale, luke warm, and meh.

Some of my best memories took place in the shadow of the giant Pulp Fiction mural at this location, and the food is just as awesome. Tasty Burger is what it is, and that's a burger joint that does comfort food well. If you're looking for something fancy or groundbreaking, you'll be disappointed. But if you're happy with a wonderfully greasy burger, thin and crisp fries, and a thick, sugary milkshake to dip 'em in, you'll be in heaven!\\n\\nYou can't go wrong with the classics, and that's why I recommend that any Tasty Burger newbie start out with a Bacon Cheeseburger. It's flavorful and tender, with bacon for an added smokey and savory kick. Of course, once you start coming here more often, you can branch off into Gorgonzola Burger territory, but for now, no need to get funky funky fresh! Even though Tasty Burger has fries, I would go for the Tater Tots, which taste just like how you remember them from elementary school lunch. That's awesome and super comforting, so I love the homage to something that was so nostalgic for many of the young clientele that frequent this spot. Wash it down with a sweet and bubbly house made raspberry lime rickey or a mint-chocolate Green Monster shake (they ARE the official burger spot of the Boston Red Sox after all), and you have a perfect late night meal.\\n\\nEven though everything seems like it might just be a hipster McDonald's, Tasty Burger prides itself on sourcing from local purveyors, like the hot dogs, which are made in New England, and the sauces, which are all made in-house daily. Kind of cool, and I'm okay with shelling out a bit more cash if it means getting to eat fresh and local food. Tasty Burger is one of the restaurants I miss most from my college days, and I look forward to making a return visit soon!"},{"name":"Aman Palace","address":"63 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered through Foodler, but didn't receive what I ordered.

If you get a 3rd party voucher for a cheaper price do that. But make sure you print it because their system won't be able to scan it thru your phone. So you have to stand there and email it to them, wait till they get it and that's takes at least 15min! So after that whole ordeal they upgraded us, since I had called to ask if we needed to print the vouchers. The guy that picked up the phone, said yes. But noo he failed to say NOT 3rd party vouchers!!! Honestly if your a die hard Pirate fan then go for it, I guess.

The meal started with summer squash and leek soup, made without cream, yet rich and delicious.\\n2.With two types of beets, fresh goat cheese, spiced walnuts and a wedge or two of orange, one can't go wrong with Aria's beet salad.\\n3. As another Yelper pointed out, the lump crab cake is perfect, particularly paired with  mint, basil, cilantro, papaya and toasted peanuts.  A blend of flavors and textures.\\n4. I probably wouldn't have ordered halibut, but it ended up being my favorite dish! (The advantage of having an open mind with the tasters menu!)  Succulent, and served with jalapeno pepper (surprisingly not sharp), cilantro, garlic, heirloom tomatoes, and fingerling potatoes.   (A patron next to us ordered seared sea scallops, which he said were as good as they looked.... and they looked great.)\\n5. I was hesitant about the lamb -- I'm not a fan of lamb -- but oh.... served rare, without that overpowering lamb flavor -- slices were almost delicate and melt-in-your-mouth good. The meat was plated with a delicious dumpling -- ricotta! -- charred eggplant puree, confit tomatoes, and what they called a 'torpedo onion.'\\n6.  I read about Aria's signature chevre cheese cake, which prompted one of us to get the dessert that came with the tasting menu -- the aforementioned angel cake -- and the other to choose cheesecake.  (There was a $4 upcharge.)  Ricotta  was formerly my favorite kind of cheesecake.  Now it's chevre:  surprisingly light without distinct goat cheese flavor -- simply delicious, and served warm with a dollop of ice cream.\\n\\nSome tips:\\n-- If Open Table claims reservations for your preferred seating aren't available, try calling!  To our delight, we were able to snag reservations for Saturday at 7:00, when we called the night before.  (I don't recommend waiting till last minute, but in a pinch, it's worth a try.)\\n-- The parking lot is small but no worries -- free valet! (but leave a tip)\\n-- The wine list is pricey whether  by the glass, the half bottle, or full bottle. (They offer an amazing selection.)  We brought our own,  a lovely Rosenblum reserve zin,  and paid the restaurant's $25 corkage fee.\\n-- A mother and daughter next to us, had a smart idea by sharing everything.  Their meals were brought out already apportioned, and I noticed the serving size was the same as what one gets on the taster's menu.  A good way to save money!\\n-- Dress nicely.

The chicken fried rabbit was good and the flavors of the apple/cheese went well together.  It wasn't a dish that I would crave but it's worth trying. The pork belly on the other hand........SO GOOD. The layers were melt in your mouth and I must say, it was done perfectly. I would definitely get it again. The only sad part is that it will be hard to share...so get your own!\\n\\nWe also had dessert. The smoked chocolate bread pudding was pretty good. The salt ice cream was excellent.

Nope, neither did I... until I started reading some Yelp reviews about this little vegetarian cart that sits all lonely in the middle of a big empty gravel lot on Morrison and 20th. The suspense was killing me, but I can now say with certainty that this story has a happy ending.\\n\\nI finally made it down to try Wolf & Bear's today for lunch, and just one \\"sandwich\\" has me sold. I ordered the Out to Lunch, which consists of a \\"pita with labneh [a creamy cheese-type creation made from cultured yogurt], gorgonzola crumbles, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, falafel, salad greens, freshly cracked pepper and drizzled with tahini sauce and olive oil.\\" (ingredients lifted from the menu on the website).  As you can probably guess from the list of ingredients, this pita sandwich was fucking delicious. The heady gorgonzola was made creamy by the labneh, and then offset by the sweet onions and peppers, and made hearty with falafel and some lettuce. The addition of the \\"hot sauce\\" which is a jalape√±o/cilantro puree that's both very spicy and incredibly delicious, totally completed the combo. \\n\\nServed up with a little side dish of peperocini, 2 kalamata olives, a pickle half and some uncooked onion (?), it made for a fairly filling yet obviously healthy lunch for $7 (yowch!). I understand the high price since everything is made from scratch using wholesome ingredients, but it always smarts paying much more than about $6 for only food from a cart. \\n\\nThat said, I will not hesitate to recommend this cart, especially to vegan and vegetarian friends. The falafel and cheeses made this sandwich plenty hearty for me, the meat lover, and the fact that any dish here can be easily made vegan without taking too much away flavor-wise is a major bonus. \\n\\nGood stuff."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was AMAZING!

Most of them never gave me and my brother the 60+ pieces of sashimi we order every time so usually we have to make multiple orders to get the amount of sashimi we want (I understand that a lot of people order too much and don't finish their food at all you can eat.)\\n\\nI arrive at Ninkazu with free parking which is a plus, and their menus also have a slightly bigger selection than Tomokazu. Age Manju, Soft shell crab roll, raw oysters (was crossed out), chopped scallop rolls, and a few other items that Tomokazu used to have but had removed from their menus over the years.\\n\\nHere are my dislikes: \\n1.We ordered 45 pieces of salmon and toro (tuna belly) but received 12 pieces, other raw fish that we've only ordered 3-6 pieces, came out to be 6-9 pieces, except the raw beef which we ordered 6 pieces and ended up getting around 12 pieces. It took them 30mins but it was quite busy. \\n\\n2. I waved down one of the waiters and asked him if there was a limit on the sashimi and had explained the above to him, he apologized and said that the kitchen might have gotten the wrong order. So we gave him the sheet asking for 60 pieces of both salmon and toro sashimi and he confirmed if this was what we wanted, we told him yes. It took another 30mins and only 15 pieces of salmon and toro came, I guess it was slightly better.\\n\\n3. We were about 1hr 45mins into the dinner now (about 8:45pm) and only 30-40% of the tables were filled. We had threw in another order of 60 pieces of sashimi. After waiting for 30mins, we waved down a waiter and told them that we had been waiting for 30mins now for the sashimi and they apologized for the wait since it was so busy.... I looked around and uhh remember the 30-40% tables being occupied? Yeah... ._.\\n\\nOne of the waiters even mentioned that if a table ordered too much food, the kitchen would question the order....\\nBut my table was always cleared of any food before we handed in our next order.\\n\\nIn the end, we ended up staying for 2hrs and 30mins. My brother gave up on trying to get more of sashimi so he just went for ones that were full of rice to get him full before we leave. Pretty disappointing in my opinion. I had high hopes, but those were crushed. The baked oysters did taste a lot better, and the staff (some) had smiles, but I won't be coming again.\\n\\nTL;DR I gave 2 stars only because of the food selection and free parking.

What really stands out for this unique shop, is their flavor options.

Flavors like butterbeer (with actual alcohol content), cardamom rose, orange saffron, black ash coconut and sweet cream -among many others- are some of the options you'll be faced with, and they're all as amazing and exciting to the palate as you would hope. The flavors offered change daily so expect surprises as well as a little heartbreak if your favorite isn't always there. They also have the now famous charcoal waffle cone, or you can opt for a cup. Toppings are of the limited variety but include your usual sprinkles and sauces as well as newcomers like rose crystals.

The next 30 minutes did not see it get much longer but by 9:00-9:30 it's long enough where you risk being behind last man standing. Doors open at 11 and I probably ate around noon.\\n\\nFor the haters who don't think waiting in line 4 hours for barbecue is worth it, I respect your difference of opinion but please keep those thoughts to yourself as most people here don't care. Don't be angry. I'm sure you can spend the time better waiting 4 hours in line at Six Flags to ride the Scream Machine one more time. Or getting the new XBox. It's not like I'm here the morning of my wedding. I have nothing to do so the opportunity cost isn't too much. I'm in line, talking to some college kids, drinking beer and taking in the experience. The outcome made it all worthwhile.\\n\\nNot sure if it's every Saturday but they had beef ribs that day. Initially I said no as the ladies were making their way through the line to get a meat estimate. Then I thought about it, slapped myself and told them I changed my mind.\\n\\nGET THE BEEF RIB. If it's available. Amazing. The texture is wonderful. Better than the brisket I thought. My friend in Austin said he has heard many others say the same thing. I mean, wow. Get this. Don't live your life with regret.\\n\\nI also got half a pound of fatty and half lean brisket. You really appreciate how good this is if you have ever tried to make your own brisket. Smoky, moist, delicious.\\n\\nI also got one sausage link. Hey, this was really good too. Great flavor. I added a bourbon banana pie to keep my body from going into meat shock. Pretty tasty as well. Live Oak beer to wash it down.\\n\\nBring something to sit on unless you want to pay the dude across the street $5 for a chair. I brought a little styrofoam cooler to sit on which seemed to suffice. Make sure your cell phone is charged fully. Bring a book if you want. Bathrooms are available early on too so don't wait too long for the beer."},{"name":"The Pie College Park","address":"2429 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We stop here during the College Park Jazz festival.

I have been to several juicy crab locations and this was my first visit to the new tucker restaurant. I'm not sure if changes have been made at all locations but if they have I will not be returning to any juicy crabs. \\n\\nFirst is the waste, our drinks were served in disposable to-go cups and we got plastic utensils despite being at a restaurant where you pay upwards of 25 dollars a person for your meal. \\n\\nSecond are the drinks. I think drinks are no free refills because we weren't asked a single time if we needed a refill. 2.50 for one small Togo container of unsweetened tea? That's ridiculous. If there are free refills I wouldn't have known because we never saw our server aside from when she took our order, when she dropped off the food, and when she brought the check. \\n\\n\\nLastly the prices have stayed the same and the quantity of food has dropped. Our first visit to juicy crab at another location was nearly a year and a half ago and we got 3 or 4 potatoes and an ear of corn with each meal. There were a couple of trips where someone at the table got some extra corn even. The food is still plenty to fill you up but I would expect the prices to drop if they drop the quantity of food. Potatoes and corn are cheap anyways compared to the other items in a meal so why the decision to only give one small golfball sized potato with my meal? \\n\\nI won't be back after this visit. I don't like to feel nickel and dimed by a restaurant where two people eat for over 60 dollars. Bring back actual drink glasses, real metal utensils, and more generous potato and corn portions and I would happily return.

Lemme tell you, no one in KC can compare to Franklin. Franklin will easily surpass any BBQ place in KC.\\n\\nI was actually going to skip out on Franklin because I had no interest in waiting several hours for food. However, I found myself looking for somewhere to eat a late lunch, and I thought it was the perfect time to try it out - assuming that I had beat the early lunch crowd.\\n\\nI got here around 2 PM on a Wednesday, and there were only about 10 people outside. I got in line, and shortly after, a Franklin employee came out to tell us that they were not going to be able to guarantee that we would get any food by the time we get inside. Essentially, we were told that we could risk it by staying and waiting another 45 minutes, or you could tap out now and come again tomorrow.\\n\\nI was willing to risk it - I didn't have anywhere to be, and I was already here. Their estimates for waiting times are actually fairly accurate, but you can tell people get antsy and try to get inside as quickly as possible, even if there's no room for them to stand. \\n\\nAfter I got inside the door, where they anticipate a 30-minute wait from there, the same employee came over to tell us there was still plenty of food left, and we can order anything we want. I was relieved, as I actually walked about 1.5 miles to get here in some powerful heat and had already waited 20 minutes at that point. I didn't want it to all be for naught.\\n\\nAfter getting my food - brisket, pork ribs, and potato salad, I found myself a table and dug in. The brisket was amazing. I veer on the fattier side of meats, and Franklin did not disappoint. The pork ribs slid right off the bone. The meat for both the brisket and pork ribs were so tender and perfectly seasoned. Even cold (when I had the leftovers later in the day), they remained tender!\\n\\nI love that they don't slather their meats in BBQ sauce, like they do in KC. I'm a strong believer in not having to add anything to my food - it should already be perfectly seasoned and have what it needs when it gets to me. They do have BBQ sauce and other condiments, if you do want to add to your meat - but at least try it without first.\\n\\nAnother thing that I have to say is that their Sweet Tea is freaking delicious - it's not too sweet. I hate when sweet teas feel like they have a whole bag of sugar in them - but not at Franklin. It was the perfect complement to the BBQ. \\n\\nThe only thing I didn't like was the Potato Salad. It was just too mustardy and vinegary for me. I prefer a more simple potato salad, and the mustard just overpowered it for me. I actually ended up throwing it away because I just couldn't stand to finish it.\\n\\nThe staff at the counter were SOOOO nice. I ended up with almost a half pound of ribs for free! It was too much food for me, so I took it home, but it was still a nice gesture.\\n\\nIt was certainly worth my 45-minute wait, but I really don't think I could ever stand to wait more than an hour.

Deep smoky flavor. \\nLa Barbecue...smaller quantity, nice mix of dark & white meats, has a wetter consistency \\n\\nSausage:\\nFranklins...has a richer, thicker consistency.

Too hot \\n\\nPork rib:\\nFranklins...bigger, longer rib bones. Dryer although sauced. Good flavor. \\nLa Barbecue...smaller in size but juicer, wet consistency with more heat factor. Much more pepper. \\n\\nPotato Salad:\\nFranklins...more southern with a great deal of mustard. Thicker cuts of potato. Pairs better w smoky bbq flavor. \\nLa Barbecue...stronger dill flavor, potatoes seem blended or minced. Dryer consistency. \\n\\nbeans:\\nFranklins...awesome pinto beans.  Taste smoky and low simmered. Not typical bbq beans. Nice twist. \\nLa Barbecue...HOT.

Also, skimming through most of the reviews I can't help but notice that most of them are positive, which makes me wonder why my experience was the worst I've ever had in my entire life. Anyways, here's what happened: \\n\\nJust landed in Portland, checked into the Hawthorne Hostel and was super excited that Papa G's was a short bike ride away. I remember hearing about this place, I believe on The Stumptown Vegan's Podcast, so I had to check it out. At first, I loved the place--aesthetically speaking. Very comfortable vibe and what seemed like an eclectic selection. At first, the lady behind the counter was really nice to me and was answering all of my questions without seeming annoyed. I believe I ordered a tempeh sandwich and grabbed a big local beer while I waited at my table. She said my sandwich would be out shortly. Now, I don't know about anyone else but when someone tells me that my food will be out shortly I assume they mean 10-20 minutes, most likely far less since there were only three other people there who were already served. Twenty minutes went by, still no food. I charged my phone, did some stuff on my laptop, drank my beer, went outside for a cigarette, took some pictures outside, texted and used the restroom--which was about 40 minutes later. I just figured that they must of ran out of tempeh and do some kind of special preparation to season it well. I didn't want to come off as a jerk and rush her if that was the case or if she was preparing take-out for a customer that had higher priority. It was well over an hour and I couldn't wait any longer, so I went up to the counter. To prevent this story from getting even longer, suffice to say and she literally said, \\"I thought I served you? Ooops, I totally forgot about you.\\" Not even an apology. This would be unacceptable even if the place was packed, let alone if you're the only customer. Imagine how that makes someone feel. So, I ate my straight out of the package, bland as hell tempeh sandwich and proceeded to take my dishes up to their sink area, for what I perceived to be a pretty nice gesture as I knew she was doing dishes. For some weird reason she got offended that I brought my dishes to the sink area, gave me a dirty look and told me sharply to \\"leave them!\\" I have never been more embarrassed, dissatisfied, annoyed and bewildered by a dining experience EVER. I don't know if she had an off day or what in the world was going on, but a customer should never have to endure that. I came in feeling great and I left feeling like absolute shit. I will never come here again and will only recommend this place to my enemies."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"It was a beautiful day!

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fox Brothers has some awesome barbecue. Living so close, I can't believe that I've only been here twice. It's usually pretty busy but I haven't had to wait a ridiculous amount of time yet. Their patio is probably the biggest drawback. Because it's a slated roof top, it doesn't keep the patio area cool enough and the sun is always glaring in your eye. Service has always been pretty attentive, even when they clearly are slammed.\\n\\nTheir brisket is tasty, and not too fatty, which is my personal preference. Pulled pork and ribs are also good. The meat pretty much falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. That's how tender it is. My favorite is probably the smoked wings. They have both dry and wet options. Definitely go for the wet. Their wing sauce is top notch. In fact, you can even purchase it to take home.\\n\\nI think the biggest thing that sets Fox Brothers apart from the other barbecue joints in the area are their sides. Their tots and fries are A+ no doubt about it. But my personal favorite is the Fox-a-Roni. I know it sounds really cheesy (and it is... LITERALLY!) and too much like beef-a-roni, or rice-a-roni but it tastes SO good. It's Brunswick stew on top of macaroni and cheese. Seriously, that's like two sides in one, so why wouldn't I get it? That means if I get a plate, I've basically ordered three sides for the price of two! I'm no Brunswick stew connoisseur nor do I have much to compare to but this was awesome. I loved the little brisket chunks in the actual stew. Also, Fox Bros uses shells for their mac and cheese. Shells are probably my favorite pasta because I love that the sauce gets trapped in the inner coil and when you bite down, you get a burst of sauce and cheese in your mouth. We also ordered the spicy green beans. These weren't my favorite, but I'm also not a big fan of the Southern way of preparing green beans. I've also tried the Frito pie, which is pretty cute because they put the actual \\"pie\\" in a Frito bag. It's all about presentation! \\n\\nAfter my most recent Fox-a-Roni discovery, I will definitely be hitting up Fox Brothers more often, if not to try new things, then to just indulge in a vat of Fox-a-Roni."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"OK, my sister LOVED this and thought it was terrific. Me, not so much, but then I am from Vegas, so the show was not so impressive. However the dinner was quite good for this type of venue. \\n\\nWe went on Super Bowl Sunday and it was poorly attended (112 people). We used a Groupon and paid for the upgraded package which was supposed to include closer seating and 2 alcoholic drinks. Supposedly this increases your chances of being selected to participate. We did get seated in the second row, but no one was on the first row. We were the ONLY people, except for the cast, that dressed as pirates, but were ignored. Ageism? The drinks that were supposed to be offered were red, white, rose or champagne or beer. I asked for champagne. No that didn't come with the package. OK, red. No, no not that either.  \\n\\nThe audience is divided into 6 groups, each assigned to and cheering for your \\"pirate,\\" much like Medieval Times, if you've ever been to a show like that. Our pirate was a bit of a dud. He didn't interact with us at all, but the pirate next to us came over and heckled us a few times. The atmosphere would likely be a lot better with a bigger crowd. \\n\\nThe show itself was OK but the story was difficult to follow--I'm sure kids enjoy the stunts and fighting but probably don't have a clue what's going on. The couple of Cirque de Solei-type acts were good and saved the tedium for me. \\n\\nThe photos were WAAAY overpriced.  $25 for one and they try to sell you three. Why don't these places realize that they'd sell a lot more if they lower the price?  The photos are already printed up, not ones you look at on a video screen, so it's such a waste. \\n\\nMy recommendation--don't pay full price for this and don't have high expectations.

Saw that customers were also talking up the rest of the menu so gave it a whirl. The pasta was overcooked and underseasoned. Unfortunately the hair was snaked in the half portion that I went to eat a day or two later, so I did actually eat some of it. The meatballs were also underseasoned and I suspect low on meat, heavy on filler like breadcrumbs or straight bread, because on of them had some kind of firm doughy chunk inside of it (NOT cheese). Also had the steak bomb sub. I thought they were meant to be like a cheesesteak, but there was barely any cheese, and what cheese there was appeared to be kraft American cheese, not provolone. Bread was that cheap kind like wonderbread, made with bleached flour. It's not good bread. These subs are all about the meat and cheese, usually, but the cheese is also awful and the meat was really dry. The \\"bomb\\" it supposed to come with mushrooms, peppers, and onions, but I barely spotted any in there. It was mostly dried out meat. I think the fried calamari was previously frozen. It had that fishy smell that fresh seafood never does. It only comes with their marinara sauce, which is actually a nice red sauce, but serving any seafood without lemon is surprising. Even one lemon wedge for squeezing over might have just brought the calamari into the edible range.\\n\\nI would never recommend anything but the pizza, but after the huge HAIR in the pasta, which calls into question the most basic of hygiene practices, I honestly can't recommend eating anything here.

The hubby and I have enjoyed romantic evening sitting outside, group dates with friends at the bar for tapas and even an attempt at salsa dancing on Thursday nights. \\n\\nIt's a classy place for dinner with chandeliers, linen table cloths and impeccable service (tho we perfect the outside seating when the weather's nice). Yet, when you sit at the bar after a long day you can let loose and enjoy the huge drink selection and $1 tapas. The tequila list is pretty amazing and I always tell people to get the pitcher of margarita. It's a little pricey (check back before you go tho cause Masa runs 1/2 off margarita pitchers from time to time) but these margaritas taste like candy and kick you on your ass after a few sips. Thursday nights they do clear away the tables and have salsa, which is a great find in the South End. \\n\\nFood!! Everything is so delicious and equally beautiful! The best part about their food is that they don't shy away from using FLAVOR! Some of their dishes are spicy (beware boston! haha) but most just have incredible flavor from spices, peppers and quality product. Thank you Masa, the hubby and I have found our niche for great tasting flavor bursting southwest flare. I second everyone that raves about their corn breads and dips; honey butter, hummus and black bean. Great way to start your meal. Favorite dinners include: The tuna in yellow mole, pork shoulder with chorizo and swordfish with banana papaya sauce. I don't know if Masa still has the key lime creme brulee dessert, but if they do get it!

Right next door is their bar called Jake's Grill. \\n\\nMy friend had a couple old pals in town and decided to take them to Jake's Crawfish. We decided to dine in and endure the love of seafood and wine. After being seated for about 30 minutes (FAIL #1), our waiter finally decides to check up on us and deliver us the specials of the day. It was late at night and upon hearing the menu suggestions we decided to eat a light meal.  \\n\\nI chose to go for a healthy route and tried the Manhattan Clam Chowder (clam chowder with a tomato base instead of cream). It was exceptional because there was lots of clam pieces and veggies. I was glad that they did not skimp out on the clams. I also had the honor to sample their escargot and it was cooked beautifully. It wasn't overcooked or burnt and had enough flavor from the sauce that it was cooked in. I also was able to sample their appetizer of Lox - the smoked salmon and sauce was delicious. \\n\\nWith a lovely restaurant, and exceptional food, I wanted to give this place a 4, but unfortunately we had shitty service. When dining out, servers should be able to compromise having several cards being used when paying for a large group of people. People do not carry cash these days and as my polite group asked nicely about having this type of transaction occur, the waiter said yes but immediately ROLLED his eyes as he was walking away (FAIL #2). I was a bit baffled by the waiter's action because from my knowledge of those who are in the waiter business, it is allowed to have multiple cards run for the payment of the bill. \\n\\nSo our table decided to tally up their own total and write what should be charged to each card to make life easier on our waiter so that they would not be able to make separate bills.  My group and I totaled what we ate and added the service charge since we were are large group. Just to make sure, we double checked our addition and made sure everything was correct. We had enough cash and amount on the cards to suffice the bill and then some. Unfortunately the waiter came back saying that we were about about $7 short. To my dismay I was a bit shocked to hear this because the totals were counted twice if not three times. \\n\\nTo prevent any heated measures from occurring at that point. A good friend decided to shell out the $7 while the rest of us were a bit baffled over the secret over-charge our waiter had made. We sat adding the amount and it turned out he did overcharge us for something we had added correctly in the first place (EPIC FAIL #3).\\n\\nJake's Famous Crawfish is probably a good seafood joint to enjoy for probably a small party up to 4. To endure a large amount of people to enjoy this establishment would probably be overcharged by their waiters. Not to mention the unfriendliness and abandonment from checking up from our table. Although our water glasses were filled and for delicious food, I give this place 1 star. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but after really bad service, I do not think I would be dining here again. I will though try their bar and the bar menu. Unfortunately I have gone to 2 of McCormick & Schmick's establishments in Portland and have received shitty service from them. I think they honestly need to teach their waiters how to be more polite to their customers."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

It was a  biscuit bake with cream corn, bacon and chives and wait for it... topped with hollandaise sauce. I'm a lover of all things smothered in hollandaise sauce so that sold me right next to the cream corn. It was so warm and delicious and the epitome of comfort food. I'm definitely excited to come back and try more of their offerings, I certainly have my eye on that chicken pot pie. \\n\\nThe restaurant has a very southern/home-y feel with the \\"let us fill your pie hole\\" mural at the front and the family-style seating inside. The design of the dining room makes the place pretty loud when it's full but it's manageable. I was really excited when I saw the bakery too. The Little Debbie oatmeal cream pies are one of my guilty pleasures so I was so happy to see a homemade oatmeal cream pie here. I wanted to love it so much, I really did but it just didn't do it for me the way the Little Debbie ones did, there was too much cookie to cream ratio and the cream wasn't as thick as I prefer but needless to say this could still be the perfect oatmeal cream pie for someone else.

They were so backlogged with people in the restaurant + people ordering take out/delivery the wait was unusually long.   They couldn't be more apologetic and gave us a little extra as a token of their appreciation for our patience.   Not necessary but we couldn't turn it down!  Everything is worth the wait."},{"name":"Art Bar","address":"40 Edwin H Land Blvd","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here because I had a Dine Out Boston gift certificate and because, let's face it, I love to try new spots. The vibe seemed classy so we turned it into a date night. ArtBar is inside the Royal Sonesta hotel so if you're lucky you'll get to see a wedding party walk by on the way to snap some pictures by the Charles.\\n\\nI started by ordering the Fire Tonic specifically because I had seen it an another food blogger's Instagram account-- it was literally the prettiest drink I, and probably all her followers, had ever seen. Mine was just a light purple gin and tonic-- not even remotely close to hers-- I was tragically disappointed. It tasted very tonic heavy and lacked the edible flowers in the menu description.\\n\\nThe buffalo chicken dip was amazing. The poutine was nothing to write home about (3.5-ish stars). The ArtBar burger was also delish-- (4.5-ish stars). The salmon was also meh-- oily and with a salad that I would eat at home only if someone was forcing me to (3 stars). The S'mores dessert was great, but beware the size-- they say it suits 2-4 people but I would go for the 3-4 because we left overfull (but we did order 2 apps and 2 entrees before that).\\n\\nService was slow but not terrible. Our server was friendly and honored the gift certificate without qualms. The outdoor patio got buggy after 7pm in September-- they need to citronella that place up. It's a cute, classy atmosphere but doesn't really have the vibe you're looking for on a Friday night-- it's not very popular it seems, as outdoor tables opened up to about 50% capacity around 7pm on a 75 degree day next to the Charles River. I kind of wished we had ventured into the city to find better food and better digs, but I'm happy that I didn't spend a dime thanks to the gift certificate.\\n\\nSide note: we made our reservation via Open Table, and I wasn't a fan of the detail that they only reserve a table for parties of 2 for 1 hour and 15 minutes; parties of 3-4 for 1 hour and 30, etc. It comes off as cheap and tacky. The rule didn't hold true as we had our table for 2 hours and no one hurried us to leave-- on the contrary, we needed to be uber-focused to get our server's attention and there were open tables aplenty-- but just don't mention it: it turns your guests off to visiting."},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing food and wonderful service!

So for instance, 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 meatball should be $3.00, but they charge $3.00 for EACH topping even though it is only on 1/2 the pie.

I ordered the California burger (house made burger) and really wanted to love it, but unfortunately the burger was a tiny bit mushy, the bun looked and tasted like those cheap 89 cent bleached white buns from Kroger. I also overheard the guy (the owner I think?) tell someone they don't make their tempeh bacon in house and use a packaged product you can get at any grocery store. Kinda disappointing. The flavor of the burger was good, though, and the fries were GREAT! A little overseasoned perhaps (I am kinda sensitive to salt though) but whatever the seasoning was was delish. The peanut butter shake deserves four and a half stars.... that thing was good.

The waitress had no personality and took our drink order.  We reviewed the menu and ordered a house salad and a small Milano pizza.  The salad was literally all lettuce with about 8 grape tomatoes halved and red onion slices with balsamic drizzle topping.  I like my salad but this was just way too much lettuce, apologizes for no pictures.  The pizza came out it a square and only sliced into four pieces. I would have thought they could have cut it into eight smaller slices, but that's ok.  The pizza was fresh and delicious otherwise.  Service was not friendly, felt like she didn't want to be there.  Finally from Yelp, it had a 10% discount and she only deducted it off the salad not the entire meal.  I didn't say anything as I would have normally said something.  I just gave a smaller tip.  We will never be back."},{"name":"Dark Horse","address":"2922 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This place has a ton of character.

This is to express the things that hinder the full enjoyment of dining here.\\nFirstly the booths, are not designed for larger patrons. I have previously inquired about getting seated at a table, but unfortunately the request was refused, for some unknown reason.  If you're a customer, you should be able to have simple requests honored, if it reasonable & it helps your enjoyment of the establishment. Am I Wrong?\\nSecondly, the service has been slow, even when not that busy.  I understand that sometimes places get short staffed, when employees call out.  Although that was not the case when I experienced the slow service.\\nLastly, the restroom seriously is lacking in attention. I flat out refused to use them, after I saw this. The condition of the men's room, was exactly the same on several occasions.\\nI really wish these 3 issues, could be addressed, because, I do really want to patronize this location, because it's extremely convenient and the employees are really friendly and work hard."},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good pizza- a little pricy, but totally worth it.

I ate the halibut and a couple of pieces of broccolini, but left most of the $32 dinner on the plate. Wouldn't order this again. The dish was also poorly plated with lots of careless slop on the side of the large bowl (see photo). Service was great but sadly this halibut dish was disappointing to say the least. Question. Does chef taste these dishes before they go out? I like a well seasoned dish, but OMG, this thing was just about inedibly salty.

But I think it's also because when Justin and I go out to eat, we choose places that look good and review well. We don't really eat out much because I love cooking, so we mostly go to decent restaurants.\\n\\nAnd this is another one of those \\"decent\\" restaurants. It's probably one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta. I remember a few summers ago when he was interning in ATL, I was doing the keto thing for a while, so I opted out of the fried chicken. Big mistake.\\n\\nHe exclaimed how good it was, so I said what the hell? A few bites won't hurt. I got the bacon wrapped meatloaf, and while I'm sure it was probably packed with flour and such, that's what I got. The meatloaf was pretty delicious, but the fried chicken was better.\\n\\nWhen we moved to Atlanta last summer, I didn't hesitate to order the fried chicken immediately. I knew I wanted to get it. We came again last night, and I got the fried chicken. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get anything else but fried chicken when I visit Revival. \\n\\n_ fried chicken $20\\nFOR ME, it's the best fried chicken I've ever had. And I will tell everyone who comes here to get it for their visit. Fight me if you disagree. It's just so good and I dream of it. Any time I think of fried chicken, or have it elsewhere, I immediately compare it to revival. I got it with a side of the creamy peas. The peas had a bit of a bite and were delicious. I enjoyed them a lot.\\n\\n_ bacon wrapped meatloaf $22\\nreally good, and I'm sure a top favorite of people who come here. I do think it's really tasty and I love their meatloaf, but after one time, I'd rather either get the fried chicken (can you tell how much I love the chicken here by now?) or something else. I'd love to be able to say one day that I've tried the whole menu. Justin got this with the collard greens, which are good too and a southern classic. \\n\\n_ the cornbread comes before your meal and it's so HOT and delicious. the butter melts as soon as it hits the bread and is just so good. If I'm going to eat carbs (I'm no longer doing keto anyway), this bread is what I want to eat. I'd love to have this for breakfast every day.\\n\\n_ old fashioned $11 - their version has a slight twist on the classic drink. Justin loves it and always order it when we come here. I've gotten it a few times and yes, it's really good\\n\\n_ northern wind $13 - i was having trouble deciding on a drink because I didn't want to pick just ANY drink. the waiter said this is one of his favorite drinks and it's pretty boozy and boozy it was! I had a nice buzz going after finishing this drink. \\n\\n_ cinnamon roll bread pudding $7\\nfor the price, absolutely worth it. It's kind of dense like you would expect with a bread pudding, but with great cinnamon flavor. we opted to get a dessert because we forego'd the appetizer round. we're trying to try more desserts. Delicious and a great way to end the meal! \\n\\nWaiter and hostess both were extremely friendly and attentive. Valet was complementary, but a tip for them is always welcomed.\\n\\nLastly, while we made a reservation, I don't think a reservation is absolutely required if you're coming for dinner time.

There must have been some crab on it because there was a slight fishy taste, but you would have needed a magnifying glass to find it.  The dish had a musty taste as if it was beginning to support a  fungal infestation.

A random sedan with character, all the windows down and unidentifiable debris in the back seat and rear window came barreling into the parking lot and parked in the designated carry-out only parking spot.  The tank-top clad and lightly bejeweled driver hopped out and started walk-dancing across the parking lot and down the sidewalk. As I awkwardly took a few steps away from the car and pretended to be interested by something on my smartphone, a mustachioed man walked out and introduced himself as Basil, the manager. He inquired about the car and I narrated the story to which he shrugged and stood outside with me for a few minutes until another driver walked across the parking lot and hopped into the car driving away; a upstart competitor of Car2go perhaps?\\n\\n\\nAnyways, I told Basil that I was waiting for some friends and he asked if I had reserved a table as we would be 7 persons total. I informed him that I was not aware I could make reservations. He told me that it wasn't a problem and he'd take care of it. \\n\\n\\nA few minutes later everyone arrived and we entered the store and started to place our order. He pointed to the table he had reserved for us and told us it would be ready in a couple of minutes. After ordering we went to the reserved table and while waiting he stopped by and asked if we wanted a tour? As we were with 3 kids we answered in the affirmative and were shown the whole process from the imported ingredients, large dough mixer and even larger walk-in refrigerator with copious cheese which Basil offered us pieces of to try; delicious!\\n\\n\\nAfter our tour we returned to our table as our pizzas arrived and Basil pointed out the side table of additional ingredients including chili oil, chili peppers, sliced basil, etc. Many of us picked out some items and began to try the pizzas. They were all great; good quality ingredients and sauce, great dough, good ratio of ingredients to dough and sauce and all wood fired to a harmonious result. Adding some chili was personally the final component to one of the best thin pizzas experienced in Austin and the absolute best service and dining entertainment in an Austin pizzeria!\\n\\n\\nBasil even brought us a chocolate pizza which the kids and adults alike crushed. After the rest of our party had left, I attempted to give Basil personally an extra tip for his hospitality and generosity; he flatly declined stating \\"I'm not about that.\\"  He later told me that he insists that all tips be \\"forwarded to the staff.\\"\\n\\n\\nDue to the distance I don't get to DeSano as often as I should, mostly when friends or family visit.

Just thinking about it is making me salivate and wishing they opened up a shop in California so I could indulge. It is just THAT amazing.\\nI read about the long waits, so I am glad we got super lucky we had no wait at all. Granted we did come on a Thursday afternoon around 1:45 pm close to closing. We were worried that we wouldn't be let it, but they sat us down and got our food ready really quickly. \\nHonestly I think the most worth it (if you are going and wanting to share chicken and waffles with someone) is to get the chicken & waffles, get either 2 or 3 pieces and then add an extra waffle for ($7). This comes out to be a little cheaper than paying $12.50 for two 1 piece chicken & waffles. The chicken pieces and the waffle are HUGE. One waffle serving fits the entire plate. Both the chicken and the waffle are super crispy, you can hear the crunch in every bite. The chicken itself is crispy and moist, just what you want from a perfect fried chicken. Another twist is that the waffle is made out of sweet potato! It definitely has a little sweetness and flavoring of the sweet potato, and it complements the fried chicken with maple syrup very well. If you are not a huge fan of sweet potato, they do make normal waffles or the seasonal special as well. We tried the praline bacon as well which came with 3 big pieces. It was not super crunchy, but it was very delicious! I am usually not a huge fan of pralines and this thing was COVERED in pralines, but it actually added to the flavor of the bacon, giving it a different texture enhancing the sweetness from the brown sugar. Everything about the bacon went well together. I would definitely getting this as a little \\"appetizer\\" to share. \\nI wish I could back here more often. Even when we had leftovers the waffle and chicken were still delicious and crunchy the next day.

The better part was that he tried to convince us the bar was backed up so a bottle would be better than drinks.  Rookie move, we're not rookies.\\n\\nWe were with another couple and the ladies split the wine.  My friend had a martini which was made incorrectly.  Nothing too big, but for what they charge it should be perfect.  We ordered three appetizers: the tuna which was outstanding, the lobster mac & cheese which was lukewarm and had very little lobster in it ($20 for an appetizer, it should have lobster) and the pork cheek and grits which were phenomenal.  We then ordered dinner, and waited......and waited.....and waited....and waited.....and waited.....and waited....and saw the restaurant empty out and waited some more.  I had ordered the vegetarian spaghetti and meatballs because it sounded very unique.  Very small serving, and when it came, it was warm and glazed over because it had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time.

Total: $10.28.  The bread was fresh baked, light and crispy.  They loaded the pulled pork and the onion.  The pork was marinated and tasted, to me, like eating left over Turkey after Thanksgiving  (one of my favorite things) .  The onions were fresh and really enhanced the flavor of the pork.  Good stuff.  I can only offer one suggestion.  Because of the quantity of pork, it tended to get a little dry.  I think an Au Jus or beer for dipping the sandwich in would rock.  As for my fries, they were perfect.  Soft on the inside and crispy on the out.  The sandwich came with a bag of regular Lays (I didn't know that).  I could not eat all of my fries, and I left the bag of chips for someone else.  It was a good portion of food for 10 bucks.  I felt good after eating my sandwich.  Good flavor!!

The great thing about this place is that not even do they do an excellent steak, they also have plenty of seafood if you're not in the mood for red meat. We got the seafood tower as an appetizer and everything was extremely fresh. Although I wasn't in the mood for a steak on this night (I got the sablefish), I was able to sample the short rib and lamb. I got to say the lamb was basically like butter as it melted in my mouth. Most tender lamb I've ever had. As for the sides, I could probably do without the onion rings for $12 for five. You could get the same from Red Robin lol. However, the risotto was delicious. At the end of the night we had packed a bunch of food to go. However, one of our group's short rib didn't come back. We let them know and they basically cooked up a new one and comp'd it.

It's way overpriced, but is trying to convey this relaxed vibe.  And look at what people are ordering.  Everyone's having the cheap stuff.  This place should be slammed -- it 's a gorgeous day and there are tourists everywhere.  The prices are just ridiculous and there's not really anything else besides the almost waterfront location that is worth returning for.  I walk by here when I'm coming home from work and it's always filled with these loud assholes--\\n\\nFrancesca: Yah dudes.\\n\\nHusband: Yes, them.  Tourists don't know any better but anyone who comes here over and over must be an idiot - there's no view, the prices are too high, and the service is crap.  \\n\\nFrancesca: yeah, if I'm going to spend this much money, it should be a classier experience.  \\n\\nHusband: This burger tastes like reheated ass.\\n\\nFrancesca: I think that's literally what it is.

I found Mario's to have few redeeming qualities and this is one restaurant I cannot recommend.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very relaxed.  There are approximately twelve tables in the entire space.  It's sparsely decorated with a handful of reviews, a map of Italy, and a few signs.  The brick walls are a nice touch.  I'm all for a homely experience when dining (their slogan is \\"Closest thing to Mamma's Cooking\\"); unfortunately, this comes off as cheap.  They aren't trying to be a dive - so I wish they'd use nicer table clothes and dishware.\\n\\nThe food here is the real tragedy.  We started off with the shrimp scampi, Italian sausage, and the mussels in a red sauce.  The Italian sausage was solid.  It had that nice salty flavor that you come to expect from a good sausage.  The other dishes left a lot to be desired.  The shrimp was non-distinct and it was served over a piece of their bread that had been soaked in sauce.  The bread by the way was neither homemade nor fresh.  The mussels themselves were okay but the real crime was the sauce.  I would think any authentic Italian restaurant would have a decent marinara.  Not here - this stuff tasted like watered down Prago.\\n\\nThe side salads were pretty offensive as well.  The lettuce was bagged, the vegetables were not fresh, and the dressing was of the bottled, Sysco variety.\\n\\nMy main course was the special - Lobster Fra Diavolo.  Between the rest of the party, there was fettuccini alfredo, chicken with vegetables, and chicken limone.  Both chicken dishes were decent.  The chicken was lightly breaded and pan fried.  They had a solid flavor and I'd give each of those dishes 3  1/2 stars.  Unfortunately, the vegetables that came with them were probably of the canned variety.  The fettuccini alfredo was weak.  It had a spoiled taste that I could not get past.  The fettuccini was supposedly made in house - but I didn't find it anything to write home again.  My dish was the worst of the evening.  Their Fra Diavolo sauce was pathetic.  They used the same sauce here that they did on the mussels.  The addition of chili peppers was the only distinct difference I saw.  The lobster was over cooked and chewy.  I was not impressed with the quality of the lobster meat anyway.  In this area of the country - the lobster meat should be exquisite.\\n\\nIn a city with a strong Italian community, there are much better options.  I really can't think of any reason to go here.  In talking with others that dined with me - nothing I observed seemed to be out of the ordinary.

Most places lack the consistency or services needed to get that kind of a true rating. But I must say this place has achieved that goal and by far has the best southern food I've ever had!! \\n\\nThe Screen Door specializes in Southern, Cajun and creole food and they do it all really well. Let me start of with a disclaimer that the food is very fried, rich, and totally unhealthy, but that's what's so great about it. It's not like you could eat this stuff everyday anyways. But if you did you would be in food induced heaven. It's considered the number #1 ranked Resturant in the Portland metro area, and very deserving of that rating. I went with a group of ten friends and surprisingly we had no wait time for seating. \\n\\nAs a group we ordered a plethora of food spanning the majority of the menu. I personally ordered the fried chicken that came with mashed potatoes and gravy with a side of collared greens. I also had a side of macaroni and cheese, just because it's my favorite dish. The collard greens were tasty and well cooked. The chicken was moist and was made with just the right amount of tenderness. However, The mac & cheese was on another level of deliciousness. It's Creamy, filled with gooey cheese and could've been an entire dish on its on. Luckily for me it can be ordered as a side dish as well.\\n\\nWhen it came to time, There was very little wait time in between the dishes. It was practically non existent despite the fact it was a full house. So I complement the staff and cooks on speedy service. The waiter we had was fun and maintained a great energy with us the entire night. He was an all around joy. He cracked jokes but still conducted himself with a professionalism that's rare in the dining service, at least in my opinion.\\n\\nI personally loved this place!

A few months ago, I distinctly remember Voodoo having an average rating of 4 stars. In 2012, I believe it had a rating of 4.5 stars. Now it's at 3.5 stars and appears to be dropping rapidly. So what happened? Has the quality gone downhill over the past few years? Or is this a case where it's now become trendy and cool to hate the place? I can't speak for everyone else, but all I know is that I've been here three times and have never been disappointed.\\n\\nI guess a big deciding factor with the reviewers is the line. Fortunately for me, I didn't have to wait at all the past two times I went (I don't want to give out my secret for avoiding lines, but basically you just have to know what time of day to go and how to time it right.) If I had to wait in line for 50 minutes or more like the other reviewers, would I have been so positive about this place? Probably not. The donuts are good, but not worth waiting 50 minutes for. So I can understand the frustration.\\n\\nOthers have complained that the donuts are stale. This is another complaint I can fully understand. I once went in early in the morning and got 4 cereal-related donuts. I ate two of them as soon as I got them and they were fine. I saved the other two for dinner and unfortunately they had gone stale by that point. A lot of these donuts, especially the cereal-topped ones, seem to go stale pretty fast. My advice is to eat them as soon as possible, but even then there's no guarantee of their freshness.\\n\\nYet despite the complaints, I can't help but love this place for the insane variety. Will Voodoo Doughnuts be the best donuts you've ever had? Maybe, maybe not. However, it is almost guaranteed that Voodoo will serve the most unique donuts you've ever had. That's what they're known for, that's what they set out to do, and that's exactly what they accomplish. This isn't a gourmet dinner, this isn't an expensive $50 restaurant, this isn't a life-changing experience, this is fried lumps of dough with candy on top of it. I like it for what it is. If I want a glazed donut as a quick snack, I'll probably go somewhere else, but if I want a donut with bacon or oreos or M&Ms on it, no other place really offers that.\\n\\nIf you take these donuts for what they are, they're perfectly enjoyable. I think a big problem people have is that they hype it up too much in their minds, so much so that it's almost impossible to live up to the hype. So many negative reviews contain phrases like \\"really disappointing\\" or \\"overrated, not as good as I heard it was\\". I find that if you clear your head of all outside influences, go in without any sort of expectations, and just try the donuts for yourself, you'll probably enjoy them a lot more."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Screen Door blows any southern food I've had (in the PNW) out of the water!

The lady was kind and polite but the man was rude and not attentive at all. We were the only people there and he never even offered to refill our drinks which we paid for or our water. He brought one small plate of fries for us to \\"share\\" although each of our meals said it came with a side of fries. When we asked him about it he stared at us and said no \\"just the one for the table\\" to share! I was outraged should've left that instant. The menu clearly said fried in the description of each meal we order. That's deception if you ask me. He tagged on an 18% gratuity even though his service was incredibly lacking. The food was not good just average, but expensive  and portions were small. I've had better falafel, hummus and pitas at the mall in the food court. We brought our own desert since we were celebrating a birthday. I honestly wish we would've walked out immediately. We spent slightly over $100 that night and  were sooo disappointed. We could've spent the same amount of money, had better food and entertainment had we gone to another spot."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"8963 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Five guys in my opinion is over priced for the food they produce. Yeah the fries are amazing and the only reason I come back, but the burgers are nothing special the buns end up soggy before you finish. You can get just as good a hamburger  down the street for half the price and more toppings. If I want fries I'll go here, but for that reason alone. I've only eaten here twice for burgers and maybe they were bad days so my opinion can be taken with a grain of salt though."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Previous review:\\nHad a reservation for 10pm..showed up at 930 was told to wait for a text.

Told them I had a shrimp allergy and we ordered a chicken alfredo and spaghetti meatball..they brought me a shrimp alfredo...they made the table next to us who was celebrating a 22 year olds birthday cry because they messed up her entire night as well. Only getting 2 stars because the food itself actually tasted decent and our server was pretty attentive and nice eventho he may have messed up our order. Place is extremely loud, while expected was also overwhelming. Strongly suggest to be intoxicated before dining\\n\\nUpdated: After the manager reached out personally we decided to come back. This experience was much better. Our server Caitlyn was very attentive, refilled our drinks constantly, ensured my food allergy was taken seriously, and overall could be a server at any fine dining restaurant if she wanted. \\nThe food quality was good. We had an array of items, all were good, especially the meatballs, green beans and New York strip.

I mixed them all together. The meat was cooked to perfection- so juicy and tender. I took some home for leftovers, and it still tasted so good days later. My least favorite was the brisket. Everyone agreed that they went heavy handed on the salt. My absolute favorite was the pulled pork. As soon as I tasted it, angels started singing. I felt the same way when I bit into the Lemon chess pie. If you love that tart taste, you will love that pie. The others were pretty darn good, but didn't compare to the lemon IMO. For sides, we ordered the potato salad and slaw. The slaw was the perfect offset to the saltiness of the brisket.\\n\\nI'm not sure I would stand in line for 6 hours, but it was definitely one of the best I've had.

Happy hour menu is just two sad salads and some loaded fries that again, you can find almost everywhere else. Nothing outstanding, but their prices certainly are. The fact that they are just another Portland restaurant that adds a gratuity to your check (besides tips), really irritated me. Theirs is an outrageous 20%. I can't stand restaurateurs who can't figure out how to pay a living wage to their staff and choose to pass it on the customers instead. Change your prices accordingly and stop asking me to pay your employees, for goodness sakes."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"the man is a meat wizard, ya'll.\\n\\nYes, you will have to wait in line for 2 hours.

They do Southern food right and serve one of the meanest brunches in the city. Whenever I find myself back in PDX, I always make time to eat here. With the popularity of Cajun cuisine (what is up with that?) in Portland at an all time high, I would declare Screen Door the best of them all.\\n\\nIt's probably dumb luck but throughout my visits, I've yet to experience a bad meal. All of the food is locally prepared and sourced (\\"organic\\" for you Portlandia wannabes) and extremely fresh. That alone has hipster palace written all over Screen Door, but I promise their constantly evolving menu is worth a sample bite.\\n\\nThe Trout Pecan / Trout Orleans was flaky and delicious. Full of flavors and crusted just perfectly, this dish was perfect sitting on a bed of seasonal veggies, which in my last couple of times were on sauteed spinach. Their jambalaya was also decent, though the andouille sausage is known to be a tad dry at times. Though I'm not a huge fan of hush puppies, they do a good job of reproducing a golden crust version here. I can do multiple helpings of their pulled pork / pork belly, as well as their buttermilk fried chicken, which takes awhile to receive (and there is even a warning on the menu). None of these items are available for less than $11, which means all of this can get spendy quickly.\\n\\nBrunch seems to attract the crowds and most items on the menu are less than $10. I love their oyster eggs benedict and their farm grits, a bowl of cheddar grits topped with egg, provolone, and ham. The biscuits and gravy is solid, but not earth shattering in the biscuit breakfast world. Don't feel like platters? Try the pimento cheese and bacon sandwich, which comes with eggs and grits. \\n\\nNo restaurant is perfect. There have been notable service snafus (usually wrong orders) amongst friends and the wait for dinner and brunch can be brutal. The prices aren't exactly wallet friendly either, though brunch is still less expensive than dinner.\\n\\nUltimately, there aren't too many places like Screen Door in Portland. The food is delicious and the service has always come through for me. Though the prices are a little higher than most, at the very least Oregon doesn't charge sale tax."},{"name":"Pica's Mexican Taqueria","address":"901 Front St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"We loved it !

In a lot more words, holy moly those shrimp and grits and flaky, perfectly baked buttermilk biscuit changed my young life. The jumbo shrimp were saut√©ed in tomato, white wine, and garlic, and were lovingly placed on top a warm, comforting bowl of savory grits.

And I'm so glad I did!  Here's the rundown:\\n\\nParking: It's the back bay so it's hit or miss.  We lucked out and got a commercial vehicles only before 7pm space right on Dartmouth, but other than that there's lots of metered street parking in the area.  We went on a Monday night so I wasn't super worried.  I would guess Thurs-Sun it can be pretty difficult.\\n\\nAmbience: We sat outside - which is super lovely since it's sub-street level and there's also lounge seating.  The inside looks beautiful thought, with lots of different areas/decor/seating options.\\n\\nService: FANTASTIC.  Our server was super nice and accommodating, and she even chatted with us a bit and joked around.  My only critique - a slightly silly one - would be that that food came out too fast.  We ordered a ton of it, including a salad, and the salad was actually one of the last things to come out.  But like, 5 dishes came out rapid fire and it would have been nice to pace them a little.\\n\\nFood: The important part!  The group of us eat at lots of restaurants and have pretty high standards, and were pretty impressed.\\n\\n-Drinks - all of them were excellent (Whodi Smash, Garden District, Old Money) - well balanced with great flavor combinations.\\n\\n-Baby Kale salad - holy shit! Baby kale is a thing! It's like a kale/baby spinach hybrid and I like it so much more than regular kale.  This was a really great salad - the sharp cheddar and the sweetness of the grapes were a perfect contrast to everything else it included.\\n\\n-Cajun Guacamole - easily once of the best guac orders I've ever had at a restaurant.  And it's a pretty substantial portion with a nice amount of shrimp (though it doesn't taste shrimpy, and I'm sure you could get it without if needed), and a HUGE basket of house-made (I assume) BBQ kettle chips which were delicious.\\n\\n-Warm Honey Glazed Biscuits - I don't know what the deal is with people who are criticizing these. Maybe they had them on an off night?  I'm a semi-professional baker and a bad biscuit may as well be a hockey puck.  THESE ARE FANTASTIC.  Super fluffy and moist, with a crispy sweet exterior.  And they're huge. And there's 4 in an order. And to the person who said they didn't like that both cinnamon butter and pimento cheese were offered...then only eat one? Having both options is definitely the right way to go for sharing - some prefer savory some prefer sweet.  And I'm sure if you just wanted a double of one instead of the other they'd be accommodating.  Dare I say...I think these were better than Sweet Cheeks'...\\n\\n-Buttermilk Fried Chicken - obviously you have to order this.  Our table actually eventually had three orders - one of the half chicken (perfect for sharing amongst 3-5), and two of friend thighs.  There's barely any breading which is actually a nice shift, and my friend who came late ordered his own and asked for nashville hot with the white sauce on the side, and the server didn't bat an eyelash before saying yes.  My only suggestion here is that they automatically offer the sweet/hot sauce on the side in addition to cooked on.  The first order we got only had it baked on and it wasn't super flavorful.  The second we got extra on the side and DAMN is that sauce delicious.\\n\\n-Crunchy fried pickles -  the best fried pickles I've had at a restaurant in a long time.\\n\\n-Aged Gouda Mac & Cheese - if you like gouda, you will love this. Warning though, it's creamier than your usual mac & cheese, but good god is it delicious.  I can imagine the cheetos might get soggy eventually, but certainly not at our table given the dish was entirely devoured within 60 seconds of it landing on our table.\\n\\n-Crispy short-rib croquettes - these were tasty, but probably my least favorite item of our meal.\\n\\nSo, short story long - I highly recommend and will definitely be going back!"},{"name":"China King","address":"2366 E Irlo Bronson Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Food wasn't bad.

The mountain high food dish is served on a baking sheet to be devoured. I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese. The biscuit was baked well but not flaky. The bacon was thick and tasted great. The medium egg I quickly learned means no ruiny yolk. The second dish ordered for $9.75 was the three little pigs biscuit, baked egg in ham, pimento cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar chive grits w/ thyme sausage gravy. The grits were really flavorful (probably the best I've had) and I could taste the saguage bits in the creamy gravy.\\n\\nWe immediately compared the biscuit and gravy to our favorite breakfast place Maple Street Biscuit Company which we both agreed they beat the little pigs dish.

A definite hot spot the first few years they were opened even though the food, at best, has always just been okay.  \\n\\nNow when I say food, this pretty much covers everything.  Their shabu selections are sufficient.  They're enough choices for soup bases, meats, seafood, veggies and starches along with the typical condiments (minced garlic, sa cha sauce, soy sauce, fresh chili peppers, scallions etc) for dipping.  However, even now, I can't recall anything in particular that screams \\"Come back and order me!\\".   Same goes for the sushi menu.  They offer every imaginable item that any other typical Japanese restaurant would have but nothing especially memorable comes to mind that was dynamite IMO.  Overall, a consistent 3.5/5 across the board.  \\n\\nAside from the food, I'd upped it to a 4 rating if the servers didn't play the Houdini trick on us all the time.  Sometimes they're there but sometimes they're nowhere to be found and when they are around, the service tends to be super slow.

I had never heard of aloo pie until I stepped foot inside Kalla's. It is a pastry filled with mashed potato and spices (ginger?) and was a little sweet but also had a kick. It was good, the plantains, however, were too dry. I sampled the roti and it was really good. It looked like a soft tortilla filled with all sorts of stuff inside including your choice of meat and mashed potato. I was going to really be adventurous and try goat but I'll save that for next time. \\n\\nIt took awhile to make the food so while I waited I perused the two refrigerated cases and saw an assortment of unusual drinks.

If not just for the food alone, it's for the experience as well. While it's not for everyone, waking up early in the morning to wait 4-5 hours for barbecue with some friends is an Austin-must. Emphasis on going with friends or family. It's an easy way to pass up the time, especially with some cards or board games.\\n\\nOnto the food itself... I recommend trying everything on the menu at least once. They don't do everything the definitive best but it's all worth trying nonetheless. The sides are as you'd expect as well. Even the pies made specially for Franklin's are nothing special. The barbecue sauces are actually pretty novel and tasty. The coffee-flavored one is my personal favorite but try them all.\\n\\nIf you really want a narrowed list of what Franklin's does best, it's the brisket. It lives up to all expectations. For everything else, you can find equal or even better from their competitors. If you're looking for the same quality of barbecue without the wait, hit up Micklethwaits or LA Barbecue.

Then off to wait for your turn for the photo ops- which we never even looked at (ooops). Then you are corralled into a crowded room with high top tables and a bar and gift shop- there is a stage behind the bar. I had my grandmom (handicap) who couldn't sit on a bar stool if she wanted to and my 4 year old niece who again would likely topple off in one of her toddler shenanigans- so we hovered near the gift shop. I went and waited to get drinks- the menu has no pricing (boo) and also implies that you have to choose a glass to order a drink- my fail on not asking. 2 drinks in souvenir glasses = $36 before tax and tip. Woof. Then a little excitement on stage- all of which my grandmom and niece couldn't see thanks to their low positions. I put Addy bug on my shoulders but she had already missed the mermaid and was pouting. \\n\\nOnto entering- VIP's first and Handicap! Hooray- we can get away from the crowds- as I am hollering wheelchair coming through to attempt to part the masses with a toddler still on my shoulders. We were team Yellow and were sat in the second row since grandmom couldn't go up stairs. We were on the back/side of the pirate ship- but still had a good view. Relieved to sit and not be in line or in a herd of people- we slowly waited for everyone else to be sat. Salad came first- Caesar salad- dressing is put on top. Crisp and fresh and happy to eat something it was gone before I thought about taking a picture. We had a couple sat next to us (20 minutes after we sat) and they got their salad and meals before us. Shortly after they were served my niece got her mac-n-cheese and chicken nuggets dinner. We waited- Addy had finished her meal (and she eats very slow) by the time we finally got our meals. 1/4 chicken with mashed potatoes and veggie mix. My veggies looked like the last scoop in the pan- 3 carrots and a tiny broccoli and remnants of other veggies- I looked down at my mom's and grandmoms and they had zucchini and squash with their carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. So the next time I saw our server I asked if I could get more since mine were skimped on. She obliged and I happily got a nice big serving. The food was quite delicious- I was impressed. I know how hard it is to feed masses a good meal! \\n\\nThe show was interactive and top notch and taking a 4 year old with us made the whole night even more enjoyable as we were excited when she got to go on stage and then later when they took her away to dress her up as a British soldier! She was simply adorable. I was more excited over her reactions than the show! But that's the mom in me. Ironically a friend was there the night before on team yellow too! She has a 4 year old son!

Let's just say, his approval matters. Wasabi... oh the lovely wasabi is almost identical to Japan's wasabi. The hot feeling you may feel that strikes your brain and your nostril doesn't linger. Some favorites of mine are 24k maki roll, crispy pork belly clay pot rice, uni sashimi, tuna lettuce wrapped, and Hokkai Yaki. \\n\\nMaki rolls are made with care, as in they didn't just throw everything together and call it a day. Not thick in rice but thick enough to not feel like being cheated out. Crispy pork belly clay pot rice is delicious and great to share! The pork belly is crispy like the ones you get from Asian markets and the overall entree is not oily as you would expect from the crispy pork rice. 24k maki is my favorite because it has eatable 24k gold flakes and a hit of spice with the jalape√±o but if this isn't your kick then any of their maki is just as great. Sashimi are fresh! I've never been disappointed. When they first \\"reopened,\\" I used to get chefs special for the day to try a random nigiri or sashimi. They haven't done it all year long but that's okay. It was a big plus back in the day.  \\n\\nParking? Street parking (1-2 hours nonmetered, depending which street you park on) or you can park at Ross parking lot (behind the buildings in front of the restaurant). You can also get here by MBTA or walk if you're lucky to live close by.\\n\\nThey accept credit cards and cash... not sure if any places takes checks anymore. Price? Eh, a little up there but I'm willing to pay for quality food.\\n\\nPortions are decent. Don't expect Genaro's or Cheesecake Factory entree portion where you'll have leftovers.\\n\\nThis is where I'll go when I have my cravings and don't want to be disappointed in quality without the crazy Allston traffic + parking situation. Nice servers. There used to be a guy with glasses and always well dressed who used to talk to me when I would eat outside by myself. Nice fella who would always chat up with everyone in the restaurant to see if they're enjoying their food. Wonder what happened. I assumed he was a manager since I used to always see him for the past 2-3 years.\\n\\nAnyways, long story short.

In the first four seats at the top of the bar on the corner, by the door. It must be 35 degrees. It is FREEZING COLD!! I don't usually comment on things like that, but it is what is making this review a 3 instead of a 4. The AC ducts are right above the bar and they are shooting cold air out and it is hitting the wood ceiling above the bar and directing an arctic blast right onto the folks seated there. Try and cover or redirect those ducts somehow. Your options are likely limited because hey, it's air conditioning. But, you gotta do something. It basically drove me outta the place.  \\nAs for the dining experience: a 4.5 stars, if only that was possible. I was alone at the bar, so I will write an update when I return with a party (and NOT in that seat).\\nDan did a great job with some mezcal cocktails for me. The rainbow chard infused mezcal is great. And the cocktails he made with that, and regular mezcal, were excellent. The one with pureed corn and Fresno chillis was a perfect pair with the Woodbury clams.\\nI asked if the clams was a traditional steamer situation with a twist. I was told no. But, actually, it kinda was. It was a very savory pork broth with opened clams and toast points with parsley. Very good. If I could have a little more bread though because there was a lot of broth to sop. And maybe a softer bread? \\nBack up a bit, I started with house made chips and onion dip. Very good. \\nThe menu is SO UNIQUE. It lies somewhere between tapas and standard fare. Meaning, it is not ethnic like tapas, and the portions are larger than tapas, but enough to share with two ppl. And all are under $18. It took me a while to get my brain around the menu. There is basically three columns of dishes that are perfect to share, all under $18. And then one column of \\"entrees\\" which was nothing more than a steak dish with two cuts, one was $26 I think, and one is $44, a grilled blue fish, and a chicken thing, also both under $20. Also, a burger, which evidently always runs out by 6pm (I was there at 7p). It's weird and I am not going to go into it.\\nSo, basically, it doesn't belong on the menu if no one can order it. Take it off the menu and make it some kind of hipster secret that one needs to know the password to order. Another reason this is a 3 star instead of 4. Don't tease the patrons with things they can't order. \\nMixed in amongst the sharing plates are a couple of pasta dishes. One ravioli that I didn't try. And a whole wheat penne with favas and asparagus in a VERY SPICY butter sauce. That was excellent.\\nSome of the small plates are just veggies, like a charred broccoli with hummus that looked and smelled awesome, but, too much veg for one person. I will try that next time to share. And some are more substantial, like the pastas. Just ask for guidance. \\nThe wine list looks very unique too. A sparkling white from Tasmania! What!? A sparkling lambrusco. I tried a mainland Vermentino with the pasta. Pedestrian at best. Didn't really matter though considering the level of spice in the pasta. Get your Vermentino from Sardinia or not at all. Hope to try more wine when I return. There is also something called \\"Orange wine\\". I actually had to look it up. Sounds interesting. \\nThe atmosphere is pure trendy hipster, with some Harvard types, mostly young. There is plenty of friendly help at the front desk and lots of servers and clearers. Very astute service. \\nLots of wood, minimalist lighting, some booths and a ton of two tops. That seating arrangement, along with the menu tells me that they were directing their effort to couples.

The ramen is the standout and the slider is a close 2nd. Gyoza is also delicious and perfectly executed. I think the broth is the best I've ever had. It has a great creamy mouth feel. The pork is smokey and perfectly cooked.  The #1 comes with a 1/2 egg and adding another (full egg) is the right call. \\n\\nThe slider is a panko crusted meaty slice of heaven. It is served on a Hawaiian sweet/soft roll with pickles on the side. It was done in 3 bites and left me wanting more. \\n\\nOnly downside for me is that I live in NC and only get to Austin a few times a year. This place will be an every visit stop for me."},{"name":"No Mas! Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I am not easily impressed by aesthetics.

When we were seated, the waiter told us that we had only an hour to eat because you had to be 21 after 7. He wasn't particularly nice about it, just said we had to be gone in an hour. What's worse, is that he sat us, we sat there for 15 minutes with no attention whatsoever.  No drinks, no \\"I'll be with you in a minute\\", no menus. Totally pathetic!!!!

I did notice a couple of the rolls were only cut in 4 pieces rather than the traditional (at least in this area), six pieces. I think it really doesn't make a difference since you are getting the same amount of food. The steamed shumai that I chose for an app. while waiting were tender and flavorful.

Once you're shuffled inside of the building, you order right away. They basically eliminate the risk of people hoarding tables and crowding the restaurant by only letting you through the doors when it's your turn to order. After placing the order we found a seat immediately for our party of 6. We waited maybe 10 min at most for our food. The service is so quick here! \\n\\nThe food. \\nTalk about super rich and savory. It was DELICIOUS but I needed a nap immediately after. I think it's called Se7en Bites because that's how long it takes you to become stuffed LOL! The menu has so much to choose from I was in a panic when I got to the counter because I still couldn't choose. The awesome staff gave me some recommendations and I ended up going with one of the biscuit and gravy dishes. YUM. Also, they have cocktails here so +10 extra points in my book. Since I was in a large group I taste tested all of the cocktails. The blackberry sangria was delicious, the peach one was a bit too sweet for my liking but I also don't like white wine.

This was our one and only requirement when visiting Texas, so I had really high hopes for this place. Franklin's is known to have a 3-4 hours wait with people lining up by 6am when it doesn't even open until 11am. If you're in it for the wait, bring blankets and lawn chairs and maybe even a snack.\\n\\nBut let me give you a huge tip: preorder online! All you need is to order a minimum of 5lbs and you can skip all of the wait. The online ordering system is simple as you pick and choose your meats, sides, desserts and drinks. I was also able to e-mail them some changes on my order, which they quickly confirmed and resent me an updated order. Note that there is a $75 deposit made when you place your order though. Just like making reservations, you pick a date and time for your pick up order. We chose the first time slot at 10:30am before they even opened.\\n\\nThe pick up process was quick and easy. I checked-in, confirmed my order, paid the rest of my balance, and had all of my food ready within 10 minutes. Then we happily carried our food past the huge line of people still waiting for the restaurant to open, you poor souls.\\n\\nBetween 5 people, we ordered 3lbs of sliced brisket ($25/lb), 2.5lbs sliced pork spare ribs ($22/lb), 0.5lb of pulled pork ($22/lb), 0.5lb of sausage ($19/lb), 1 pint of slaw ($6), 1 lemon chess tart ($6), and 1 bourbon banana tart ($6). Even though they recommended about half a pound per person, we were ambitious. \\n\\nFranklin's BBQ is damn delicious. Everything is well seasoned, smoked, juicy, and tasty. But to be honest, I wouldn't physically wait 3+ hours for this, but the preorder definitely make it worth it. They include everything from pickles, onions, bread, and 3 types of barbecue sauce for you that's more than enough. My favorite had to be the pork ribs followed closely by the brisket. The pulled pork was a bit mushy while the sausages held a solid smokey flavor. I also really liked the slaw to help balance all of the meat. Finally, the pies fell flat for me. The lemon flavor was too strong and the banana was never a strong choice for my dislike of bananas, so those could definitely be passed next time.\\n\\nOverall, Franklin's is still a must try although I wouldn't quite say it's the best BBQ in the world. Don't skimp on the ribs and brisket as there's so much juicy meat on there with a perfect blend of seasoning. Come eat your heart out with BBQ goodness, but make sure you preorder and skip the wait!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"What a cute place.

The lady at the counter made sure there was seating before taking our order, which I thought was a really nice touch as there's nothing worse than ordering and not finding a seat somewhere.\\n\\nThe interior is neat. There's a lot of interesting use of materials and texture to create a cool vibe that's parts modern and even a little on the rustic side. The material used to make the barstools and chopstick holders is really interesting. It's an odd thing to notice, but you'll see what I mean when you visit. Which if you like noodles, you'll be smart to do.\\n\\nThe service was great and friendly. The broth of my #2 was packed full of complex yet delicate flavor. The slice of pork belly was out of this world, the soft cooked marinated egg was perfect in it's texture with a creamy yolk, and my corn on the bomb addition gave me a sweet little punch. The noodles were light but satisfying, and the serving size was nothing short of perfect.\\n\\nThe only miss was the A/C.

So one of my housemates and I decided to try a new spot for breakfast as a pre-study treat.\\n\\nWe chose the Cadillac Cafe, a place neither of us had ever been. Maybe it was the fact that I was starving. Maybe it was that doing anything but homework sounded appealing. Maybe, even, it was that I wanted to stuff myself with food in an effort to numb the pain of a quickly approaching semester's end. \\n\\nNow I absolutely love breakfast. I usually don't have time for it in the morning, but I will eat breakfast anytime of day that a restaurant is willing to serve it to me! My biggest gripe about breakfast: having to choose between salty and sweet. But here, I found my dream breakfast. I ordered the pumpkin almond pancakes, delectable pancakes made with pumpkin and vanilla bean and topped with candied almonds. This was served with...ta dah: eggs scrambled with veggies and cheese. I had a cup of coffee that never went empty thanks to the friendly waitstaff and a wine glass of cranberry juice that made me feel much more luxurious than it should have.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was great, and if you get a window seat it's easy to block out the craziness going on around you. The one downfall (hence the missing star) was the horrible wait time. I doubt there is a time of day that you could go to Cadillac and not wait for a lengthy period of time.\\n\\nIt's a little pricier than most, but worth a treat every month or two.

Last week, the Food Truck Armada swung into the Shops Around Lenox parking lot (which also happens to be very close to my office) and my luck changed for the better.\\n\\nAt least 8 or 9 different trucks pulled-up and created a near-carnival atmosphere of sites, sounds and aromas that were highly appealing to those of us in a hunger-induced trance, doing the zombie walk across the parking lot.  I checked out all the trucks very carefully before deciding that I would try the Pup Truck.  I was in a mood for a hot dog and the long line outside this truck told me they must know what they're doing.  The best part about the long line is that it gives you enough time to figure out which dog you're going to order.  The menu is fairly complex with a lot of variety to wade through.  Exactly like David K.'s experience, I ordered the dachsund, which says that it comes with spicy mustard and ketchup, but the dude in the truck hands it to you plain.  You then walk over to a table where another guy takes your money and tells you to pick out your chips and drink while directing you to the condiments area.  The system is sort of disjointed, but it kind of works under these circumstances.\\n\\nWith the drink and chips, the total came to around $9, which is pretty steep for a couple of dogs, chips and a drink, but not when you compare that to what you'd pay at Turner Field for the same set-up.  Also, these weren't the nasty dogs you get at a food court.  These hot dogs were delicious and high quality...like the kind of dogs you get at the old-school butcher market, with the outer layer that snaps when you bite into it like a brat.  The inside was juicy and full of fresh flavor.  I only put ketchup and mustard on it, but that was all I needed.

I think they meant to seat another table before us, but couldn't find anyone from that party.

The texture combinations - the pork, the crunchy slaw, the corn tortilla thing - and the flavor - whatever that orange sauce was on the sauce was divine - really made this dish stand out.  I also tried the sweet corn bisque that my friends ordered - sweet flavor, but not too sweet - really good, and I don't even like corn!  The chicken - not so good.  Mine was definitely charred.  It came out really brown, and I hoped that it was just whatever kind of breading/sauce it came with, but upon tasting, it really was char.  The veggie/cheese combination served with it was delicious, and I'd like to think that they were just cooking so much of the chicken thighs for the MRW menu that it would be good on another night.

So my review is mostly based on face value rather than comparison to Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao.\\n\\nIt's a small, intimate place. Maybe 20 tables, nice little bar. The salad bar is small but well packed and there's a small station in the middle for hot side dishes and a soup of the day. They have an extensive wine and liquor menu.\\n\\nI've always made reservations, as they suggest to do, but I've never seen it more than half full. Granted I've never been on a weekend evening, only during the week, so that may have something to do with it. That being said, if you decide to try it on a whim but worry you don't have a reservation, don't let that put you off, there's likely to be room.\\n\\nAs I said, the salad bar is a bit smaller from what most people describe at other places in Orlando, but it's always fresh and well stocked. They have lettuce and dressing, plus various types of marinated veggies, cured meats, cheeses, roasted veggies, different types of mixed salads (potato, honey mustard chicken, chickpea, etc.), and some ceviches. Your table is provided with an endless supply of those light, airy and cheezy popover rolls. \\n\\nThe hot sides are the standards, mashed potatoes, black beans (tasty!) and rice, plantains. The soup of the day changes daily, but I can totally vouch for their cream of broccoli - on point!\\n\\nAs for the meats, the service can be a bit slow - the last time I was there they had 2 guys doing the rounds. But I find that helps with pacing of your meal so you don't gorge yourself on too much meat at once. The selections are your standard faire:\\n\\nBacon-wrapped filet mignion or chicken\\nParmesan pork (my favorite pick)\\nParmesan beef\\nFlank steak\\nLeg of lamb (second favorite)\\nChicken legs marinated in beer (third favorite)\\nPicquina (the C shaped chunks of beef)\\nPork ribs\\nBeef ribs\\nChicken sausages\\n\\nI'm probably missing a few. The flank steak seems to come around most often but sadly had the least flavor of all the cuts. You can always ask for a particular cut if you don't want to wait.\\n\\nThe servers are very attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere is quite nice and intimate, great place for a date night or special birthday. I have to give them props on their customer incentives - sign up for their mailing list, because they do specials off the regular $39.99 price all the time, plus drink specials and such. And if you put down your address and birthday they mail you a birthday card on the first month of your birth month that's good for a free dinner! Bonus to that - you get a free slice of a decadent chocolate mousse cake!\\n\\nSo all in all, great experience, and if the price is a bit much (it shouldn't be, considering other places go for $50 and up), wait for an e-mail special about pricing or watch Groupon because they do deals there regularly. \\n\\nI go here every so often when I want to do a special treat."},{"name":"Stelios Restaurant","address":"293 Boston Rd","city":"Billerica","stars":"2.5","text":"Went there for dinner tonight..never again..nasty food..nasty manager..

Some hot sauce might have made it more enjoyable...I don't think ANY of the \\"lunch and dinner\\" type places that serve eggs serve real eggs, they all have egg beaters...I would not be the least surprised if mine were cooked in the microwave...But there was a good bit of ham and plenty of cheese and it was right around the corner from our gate in the SouthWest terminal, so I'm A-OK with the experience.  Service was pretty quick and friendly.  The bar backs up to the mini convenience store where you can get a variety of packaged drinks and snacks for your flight or preboarding experience.  The bar opens at 8:00 AM!  Got my order to go and ate it in the terminal, but there was plenty of seating in the bar area."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Basically like Franks Red Hot and butter. Good.  I'm just contemplating all the different styles of foods they serve that can be coated in their buffalo sauce. Very pumped about football season - definitely going to be working my way down the menu for it. That being said, great place to watch football and actually take a date.

I like the menu size because it wasn't overwhelming as many restaurants are. The menu looked very manageable for the staff and to keep the food fresh.  The menu also had wine pairings with a different entr√©es which was nice.  The noise level is pretty high here because it's a small room with lower ceilings and everyone is sitting within close proximity of each other. \\n\\nWe ordered garden salads, salmon, fish and chips and the signature relish burger.  For as busy as they were the salads came out promptly as well as the drinks. The house made vinaigrette for the salad was very tasty and the mixed greens were fresh.\\n\\nThe blackened salmon came out perfect with brussels sprouts and a blood orange sauce. The fish and chips had a light tasty batter that was not greasy and the hand cut fries were addicting.  The burger was painted Hills beef and was cooked perfectly the gruyere cheese was a good compliment as well as the pickled onions. \\n\\nPricing was on the higher end for the portion size that was delivered we felt.\\n\\nAll in all the food was delicious and came out pretty fast. Don't expect large portion sizes though. \\n\\nThe only issue we encountered was that the waitress was not really paying attention to us and just kept wanting to leave our table before we were done ordering three times.

I'd read about this place on Yelp and despite it being almost 20 miles from where we were staying (and us being from the UK, so this was a DRIVE!), as it was just a 'little' further than where the mall my parents wanted to go to, I convinced them to go there for breakfast. It's a small single storey building shared with a bicycle shop but easy to spot with a good amount of parking.\\n\\nGo inside and there are a few tables and a line of people waiting for their food. And while we were there, the line never went away no matter how fast it moved. They serve an all day menu (but they close mid-afternoon) of both breakfast and lunch items, mostly along the Southern tradition with a couple of extras mixed in. And then there's the bakery side - we'll come back to this later. We were greeted and had a quick exchange as to what was good and my parents spent a while on the menu before ordering. Parents had questions but I went with a good southern breakfast of eggs, biscuits, bacon and sausage gravy. It hit the spot although quite salty. Both the parents were very happy with their various combinations of grits, sausage, eggs and other bits and pieces.\\n\\nThe hot food was good, but the bakery was even better! Constantly at work, the kitchen was turning out new, great smelling items as we were there. We picked up a scone, a couple of house specials (salty caramel pecan tarts and their signature bar). SO GOOD, we ate them over a couple of days and you know what we did then? We went back! 5 days in Orlando and we ate there twice. I was telling my sister about them (we were meeting here in the Keys later that week) and she asked me to bring some along. No complaints from my parents about heading there again. We drove back for brunch, meatloaf sandwich with mashed potato schmear, a Cuban better than one we had in Ybor (where it was invented!) and a relatively simple breakfast dish for mum. Stocked up on more pies, a coconut macaron and with a lovely goodbye from the staff who remembered us, we were on our way. \\n\\nThese guys have built a business that they love working at and it completely shows. Good food, great people, even better attitudes and service.

Calamari is straight out of a deep freezer bag and into the fryer. Too much flavorless breading, chewy texture and get this! The marinara and other sauces are Heinz pouches. What restaurant doesn't make homemade sauces? \\n\\nWe also ordered 1 lb shrimp (Cajun, medium heat) 1 lb Dungeness crab (server recommended the everything sauce) read pure garlic. We asked about the sides and were told we get potatoes and corn. Try 1 small red potato each (maybe 4 bites) and half a frozen ear of corn. We ordered a side of hush puppies which typically are eaten quickly. These were hard, dense, lacking in flavor. Again from freezer bag to fryer. We left almost all of them. \\n\\nThe shrimp and crab are cooked in giant plastic bags, you eat off plastic plates with plastic utensils. Cups are disposable and always with a lid.\\nAs someone trying to reduce my carbon footprint this was a plastic nightmare.

Some of the popular menu items are the \\"Grateful Bread\\" that is described as \\"Thanksgiving dinner in your hand\\", with roasted turkey, bleu cheese stuffing, red onions & cranberry aioli on fresh multigrain wheat. Another favorite is \\"Mike's Open-Faced Meatloaf\\" with homemade meatloaf on a pressed Cuban roll with mayo then covered with cole slaw. \\n\\nWe opted for the Hummus Platter with homemade roasted garlic hummus served with toasted pita points for a starter, and it was a really good and flavorful hummus.

I think this place has the ability to survive in the tough and growing niche restaurant market of Atlanta. However, bells and whistles to the F&B can't be honored if the service isn't great. On a personal note, I know how to work for tips. Recovery is key. If you don't have a recovery system, even for sensitive issues, you are telling me you can't be bothered or afford to do so.

The kitchen was nice enough to split the salad on 2 plates without us evening asking.  They both said the salad was very good.  Also the server said it was one of there most popular salads.\\n\\nFried Green tomatoes - very good again.  It was green tomatoes topped with a layer of goat cheese then breaded and fried. comes with a tomato basil sauce drizzled on the plate.  delicious.\\n\\nShrimp and Grits - two people the table ordered it and I was able to take a bite from my husbands plates.  I have to say very tasty.  They also give a good amount of shrimp.\\n\\nCrisp Tennessee catfish - this is what I ordered and I was very glad I did.  It was cooked perfectly.

The kids version was 3 boneless chicken tenders and it had the same seasoning and breading as the regular fried chicken entree.  It also came with just mash potatoes and gravy, no collard greens.

The best tasting tacos are at Taco Deli.  Mole tacos, the Mexico City, Al Pastor and Akaushi Picadillo are some of my favorites.  And yay for Scallop Taco Thursdays! The fact that they use locally sourced (Heartbrand Ranch, Lightsey Farms, Oak Hill Farms, Pedernales Valley Farms....just to name a few) and organic ingredients makes a taste difference.  Taco Deli WINS!   \\n\\nTaco Deli's menu is bigger and they have a daily taco special.  VS  Torchy's menu is smaller and they have a monthly taco special.  Taco Deli WINS!\\n\\nI can't help feeling the hit in my wallet every trip to Taco Deli.  An average of nearly $4 a modest sized taco (although some tacos are more substantial than others, i.e. the meaty pork Chile Relleno vs. the lightly filled Akaushi Picadillo).  I don't need a ton to fill me up but 2 of these tacos usually doesn't do the trick (so an $8 bill that might leave me hungry, since I'm not a fan of rice/beans combo plates).  Torchy's tacos are much more fat; they are stuffed so many ingredients sometimes the double tortilla can't hold it all together.  TORCHY'S WINS!\\n\\nSalsa.  Salsa is secondarily important only to tacos.  Taco Deli features a salsa bar and has several options and it's fun to try a variety of them.  Torchy's adds sauces to some of their tacos vs. the salsa bar idea, and you can substitute upon request.  But when I just want a side of chips and salsa, hands down my go-to is Torchy's Tomatillo salsa.  TORCHY'S WINS!\\n\\nBranding: Torchy's \\"damn fine tacos\\" and the little devil dude is cool, and memorable.  It's also cleverly embedded in some locations as unique works of art (check out the ceramic mosaic and the 1st Street location).

I have NEVER received such quick service. I ordered the jerk chicken special and my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork. It was all SO good. I felt like I needed a nap afterwards. When we received our food the waiter told us about their 3 house made bbq sauces and brought them all for us to try. I personally like the white bbq sauce the best.

The service is five stars.  And the food?  Six stars!!  Everything was delicious, perfectly prepared and with just enough of a unique twist to keep things interesting.  The Caesar salad was among the best, if not the best, I've ever had.  Served on a chilled plate, a wedge of fresh and crispy romaine is perfectly dressed and accompanied by the lovely anchovy along with a yummy crouton.  The Scampi, while garlicky and buttery as expected, was enhanced by thick pasta, slices of tomatoes and capers.  So good.  And, oh yes, a starter of caprese salad that paired pesto with the tomatoes and mozzarella was divine. Since we had an early reservation this evening, we were pleasantly surprised to find it was happy hour!  And this is probably the best happy hour in Louisville.  \\n\\nWe finished with tiramisu and coffee (French press coffee).  And I loved the bowl of brown and white sugar cubes.

The menu boasted southern favorites in the appetizer and entree sections. Fried chicken is what they're best known for but our waitress expressed her fondness for the pork chop. We tried both, as well as the lamb shank. As we waited for our food, we enjoyed the biscuits and cornbread. The biscuits were excellent - soft, flaky, and so good!\\n\\nGreatly anticipating the fried chicken, my first impression was that the skin looked crispy and the meat appeared juicy. I'd asked for my meal to be separated so my sides and the honey jus came out in dishes rather than under the meat. This kept the skin from being soggy. \\n\\nThe chicken looked better than it tasted, as did the pork chop. Seasoning was evident on the surface of both meats but none of the goodness permeated into the actual meat. The sides were ok but I've definitely had much better greens. The spaghetti squash was fairly tasty.\\n\\nThe restaurant was loud and it looked a little unfinished inside.

The best advice I had was regarding the \\"burger\\" and they had them so we would be fine.   They told me that it was small plates and said they did not have a kids menu so be warned!  For those with kids you will know that \\"small plates\\" or \\"sharing\\" are probably two of the worst words you can tell to a 12 year old.\\n\\nWe were seated promptly and the layout of the restaurant was perfect for regular adults.\\n\\nIssue number one....no burgers....be ready to order before 7:30 if you want a burger.  No burger = shitty kids who don't understand why you can't run down the street to get more meat.....like the kid in Chef saying, \\"why don't you just buy it at the store\\".\\n\\nIssue number two...small plates - not good for kids - already said that but if your little ones can share with others and everyone gets an equal portion then the judgement of King Solomon is lost on you.  You should also get your kids to apply for the noble peace prize because they are so unique that I am sure a check for $1.2M is a small consolation for your brilliant and freakish children.\\n\\nNeedless to say the night was a disaster with the kids.  They hated sharing, hated things that did not make sense and hated the fact that there was not crayons and coloring books....my bad, I get it, I am an idiot but after 8 days this these kids at Martha's Vineyard and no real food for many days, I just wanted a cocktail and decent grub.  shame on me.\\n\\nWell that is where the story gets great.  The staff totally picked up for my errors.  Let me share the ways:\\n\\n1. They bought over \\"mock-tails\\" for the kids at no cost.  They killed with the way to show the kids a dining experience without overwhelming them.  Bravo.\\n\\n2. they made us grilled cheese - not on the menu but loved every bit of it and the kids were impressed.\\n\\n3. They gave us a list of local ice cream places that we could go to for dessert.  So I thought at first that this was to get us the hell out but they actually told the kids about the dessert menu after we got the list and tried to talk them into how great it was.  I was so impressed.\\n\\n4. Everyone on the staff came over - I was blown away with how great the manager and everyone was on our dinner and how they could accommodate.\\n\\n5. The six year old never got her meal....holy cow, that really is a bad thing for those that know how pissed a six year old can get.  but they knew it and offered to make it up.  I was blown away at how they made her feel like a grown up.\\n\\nPeople, this was my screw up.  I should have never taken my crew to this place and it was selfish to want a good meal after 8 days of fried shit but you could not imagine how great the staff was on every turn.\\n\\nIf they can treat a crappy family from Texas this well then they screw up, there should be no reason they cannot jump over the moon for you on your visit.\\n\\nBTW, the pancake, beets, gnocchi, and pickled green beans are out of this World.  We also had two cocktails which were fantastic and met out high expectations (come on people - we have four kids and we needed a quality cocktail.....amazing.\\n\\nIf you have every heard anything about bad service, you had the wrong night.  If you have every heard that they are stuff or don't accommodate, you are wrong.

Stopped in for a late lunch.  I ordered the Stubb's Major because I could not just pick two meats... I needed three.  So, I ordered the Ribs, Sausage and Brisket, my sides were potato salad and pinto beans.  I was SO excited because I've ALWAYS heard great things about Stubb's.  You know like... It's the best BBQ around.  Or it's the best in Texas!\\n\\nWhen I plate arrived everything looked in order, except one thing... they gave me only one rib... yes... you read that right... Only one rib.  The ribs happen to be my favorite part.  I did have to order the brisket though... that is how you tell if a BBQ place is really good... if they have good brisket, everything else just falls into place.  Since there was only one rib on my plate I decided to go ahead and start with that.  Took one bite and it was DELISH! One of the best ribs I've ever tasted.  It was seasoned perfectly.  Needless to say, that one single rib didn't last long.  After having something so wonderful wake up my taste buds, I was MORE than ready to dive into the rest of my plate.  So, next up was a bite of sausage.  It had to be the WORSE sausage I've ever put into my mouth.  It was super greasy and full of fat.  I really wanted to just spit it out. It also had a funky after taste.  I'm a super picky sausage eater though.  It can't have a lot of fat or grease in it, or I wont like it at all.\\n\\nRight now we are one for great BBQ place... One for bad BBQ place.\\n\\nNext up to bat is the brisket.  In my opinion the MOST important meat in the BBQ family.  I'm sure that has a lot to do with me being around too many cookoffs.  Anyway, brisket is hard to cook... and if you do it good, then you have major BBQ skills.  I examined the meat like the expert I am.  (Yeah right!) So, first I judged it on appearance.   It appeared to be VERY dry, but it did have a little bit of a smoke ring, so I have to give it a few points for that.  Next was aroma.  It smelled like BBQ brisket... so they get points for that.  Next is taste... As dry as it appeared I was hesitant to put it into my mouth without sauce, but I knew I could not get the true taste of the meat if I drowned it in sauce... So, I refrained.  Cut off a piece of this extremely dry looking piece of meat and took a taste.  It tasted like a piece of super dry brisket soaked in liquid smoke.  It was NOT good at all... So, all the + points it got were just taken away. So on a scale of 1 to 5... I have to give it a one.\\n\\nTie has been broken... One for good BBQ place... Two for bad BBQ place.\\n\\nI guess I should say a little something about the sides.  The potato salad was just that... potato salad... not anything to write home about.  The pinto beans... they also had a very strong taste of liquid smoke.  Even after that said... the potato salad and pinto beans were better than the sausage and brisket.\\n\\nAll and all...

My friend and I came during lunch so it was relatively dead, and our waitress still only managed to come around once after she took our order (to drop off our food). We had to constantly wave her down to refill our tea and also to fix our order. The sushi rolls also didn't hold together at all and broke apart when lifted from the plate.

I could've been number 1 in line. But I left. \\n\\nTo preface, we made it into Austin with the explicit purpose of acquiring Franklin's -  against the counsel of skipping it from most of Austin's Yelp Elite network weeks before. I felt I HAD to check it out, for arguments sake.\\n\\n11 P.M. we pull into our hotel straight from Kansas City to find out that the Austin Marathon was going on the next morning, and our confirmed and reserved hotel room was never ours - thanks, third-party booking. Without a room available under $400 to sleep, we sat in the car next to Franklin's from 11 P.M. till 6 A.M.; that's about the time the groupies began to show up. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, no food - I don't care what it is - is worth standing ignorantly outside for nearly as long as it takes for said food to pass entirely through your body. None. Do not fool yourself: on a weekend, you MUST wait a minimum of 4 to 5 hours. There's no working around that AT ALL.\\n\\n\\"But maybe the day I go it'll be...\\" \\n\\nNOPE. It won't. I visited during the marathon, when the entire city is literally cut into impassable road-blocked shards, but somehow 300 people figured out how to push through Austin's demonic traffic to assure a wait of still over 4 hours long. \\n\\nFranklin's business model was always designed to be a wait. If there wasn't a wait, and his food was abundant and easily accessible - which could be done with a bigger facility and more than a single man slicing all the meat by hand - his reviews would suffer through the quantitative temperance of a more complicated and thoughtful diner, and the cost of growth would be a self-defeating exercise. Selling more would actually net him less money. \\n\\nOn the other hand, if Ol' Franklin's stokes anticipation in an ever-hungry and simplistically queued creature through the smell of smoked salt, sugar, and fat over 4 requisite hours, then fed them that which they've been breathing in for half a working day, it'd be the \\"Best barbecue in Texas hands down!!!\\" ~ Quote from any recent sparky 5 star review below. \\n\\nBut is it REALLY the best, if you have to pay 5 hours of your life AND 25 bucks for a pound of brisket? Overall value matters, and my time isn't free, so the cost of entry exceeded greatly the possibilities. Albeit, it seems many other locals have nothing better to do, which brings me to my final understanding of Franklin's - and the greater Austin dining scene for that matter:\\n\\n We left Franklin's to see all of Austin (Barton Springs; The Capital; South Congress; Terry Blacks; Veracruz; Homeslice; Zilker Park; among other misadventures), then came back at 10:35 A.M.; found they were completely sold out 45 minutes before doors open - the sucker 19 spots in front of us was the last person assured meat, slated for a 2:35 P.M. lunch - give or take a few minutes. \\n\\nSitting in front of an empty Franklin's all night gave me a clarity of perspective that most aren't privy to: Franklin's is a collection of fallible people attempting to replicate consistent meat stuffs in a small building to above-average success; but utilizing those five additional hours exploring a city I've never seen proved to be worth more than the \\"best barbecue in Texas hands down!!!\\" \\n\\nTurns out, every place in Austin has a line at least an hour long - part of the culture of Texas food I've found. Food was tough to find, and when you finally got it, it was mostly not worth the cost of admission. Seeing Franklin's live before sunrise was as far as I'll ever get to his brisket experience. I wanted to be free from the ambiguous constraints of a productive business model, so I left. \\n\\nIf you stay, take stock in my many days of Franklin's research: Franklin's turkey and brisket were both assuredly on the menu for Jesus at the last supper, the hyperbole is that real. The $6 tiny pies are excellent, and all of their sides are usually a disappointment. But temper this information with the fact that the people relaying their \\"stellar\\" experiences are also the same type of person that brings beer, their favorite oakley's, a yeti cooler, and 5 useless hours of their bro-culture lifestyle to barter in exchange for edibles they're going to poop out shortly thereafter.\\n\\nJust think if you'd invested as much but then didn't like it?

Biscuits and gravy were on point, no complaints with either. Everything was very fresh and hot. My meal came with their cheesy grits, not a huge grits guy, but they were pretty good. My other half went with the fried chicken and waffles, I tried it and thought it too was delicious. We also ordered a side of their praline bacon.

The scorpion maki with shrimp on top of eel, cucumber, and avocado was nicely balanced with the eel sauce not overpowering the individual flavors of the ingredients in the roll.

I had never heard anyone talk about this place and me and my friends decided to try a place that no one has tried before. It is very easy to do this btw in Atlanta. So this restaurant has valet parking and you almost have to do valet parking because there's not really anywhere for you to park nearby. The restaurant size itself isn't big at all either. You don't have to make a reservation when you go, but almost everyone that goes does reservation so some times you might get unlucky and not be able to dine because they're booked. So make sure you do just in case. \\nThis was a fusion restaurant so they had different kinds of food on the whole menu. The last time I went to a fusion restaurant and they had a Thai curry dish. I immediately regret my decision and told myself I would get it next time. There was 2 menu items that had Thai curry in it. It was a little easy for me to choose because the other dish had pineapples in it and I'm allergic to them. Also, once your waiter comes, they will ask the table if anyone has any allergy and make recommendations off of that. But if you wanted to eat something but was allergic to a food item, they can make it without that item! \\nBut I got the grouper Thai curry and omg. Hands down was a 10/10. The taste was exactly what I had hoped it would taste like. The grouper says it's fried but it's lightly fried and it cuts so smoothly and it's so soft. The mixture of everything was so perfect with the jasmine rice. This dish was seriously everything. My bf got the chicken and waffles because a lot of people get that dish as well. I thought it was really good but at the same time. Nothing I was too crazy about but I also believe that just because my grouper Thai curry was just so bomb. \\nMy friend ordered the prik king soft shell crab which is also their other top ordered food. I couldn't taste it because it has pineapples in it. But from what my friend was telling me. It tastes good don't get me wrong by saying this. But it's one of those where it tastes good but it's more for the picture and representation. Because it comes in a half cut pineapple and has the crab just sitting on top. \\nAlso I would say that most restaurants that are 2 $ signs, it's still a okay decent pricing.

The salmon was grilled just right with a crispy outside and the inside sufficiently juicy to be on the right side of done. The dessert was an appropriate ending after a satisfying meal.\\n\\nWe had pre-chosen wines for the group dinner so I can't say anything much about the wine list.

I ordered the chicken and waffles, and while the fried chicken was good, nothing screamed special about it. The chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy, but I didn't find the batter or flavor unique. I did like the sweet potato waffles though! I liked the texture and that the sweet potato gave the waffles a sweet earthy taste.\\n\\nI also tried the shrimp and grits, which were just okay. The grits were a little boring - not cheesy or flavorful enough. Also aside from the two large shrimp on top, the other shrimps were small. Halfway through, I decided to put the egg in the shrimp and grits bowl, only to discover a strand of hair under the eggs! And if that weren't bad enough, I realized I contaminated the entire bowl when I placed the eggs in it. -_-\\n\\nWe also ordered a small gumbo, which fortunately, was pretty tasty. It was flavorful and packed with ingredients, which I liked.\\n\\nMy favorite item of the day was one of their drink specials, which was a warm caramel apple rum cider.

Owing to the large number of German and Czech immigrants, they utilized a lot of their meat-making traditions in the form of meat markets. Before refrigeration was invented less desirable cuts of meat were either smoked or ground to make sausage. Meat is smoked using offset smokers burning post oak wood, a wood prevalent to the region. \\nHonoring the meat markets predating the restaurant operating hours are during the lunch rush and close when meat runs out, often only 4 hours after opening. The meat is carved by the pound or slice in front of the customer and is wrapped in butcher paper. Also sauce, sides and dessert are an afterthought of Texas barbecue though Franklin's offers them out of courtesy to people who come from barbecue regions more known for sauce/sides. \\n\\nBrisket ($22/lb)- pectoral muscle of a steer. Filled with connective tissue this muscle helps support the weight of the cow. It also has a fat cap on one side. To turn a once-less desirable cut into something magical is the Central Dogma of Texas barbecue. Franklin's uses Prime or top Choice-graded Certified Angus Beef from ethically treated cattle free from hormones and antibiotics. Cows are pasture fed then transition to a grain and corn diet. \\nBrisket is cut to order with choices of lean or fatty brisket.\\n\\nRibs ($19/lb)\\n- Pork: Spareribs are the ribs from the bottom of the ribcage as opposed to baby back ribs, which are taken from the top of the ribcage. Located near the belly spareribs have more fat and connective tissue than baby backs. Not only does this translate to more flavorful meat, it is conducive to barbecuing. \\n- Beef: The plate rib is used as it is most suitable for barbecuing as the ribs are full of fat and connective tissue. Butchers are more willing to use plate ribs for barbecue as the back ribs are much more profitable as rib roast and ribeye steak.\\n\\nSausage ($14/lb) - a 70/30 lean/fat mixture of leftover brisket and pork butt trimmings. Though sausage is one of the meats associated with Central Texas barbecue, Franklin's doesn't make its own sausages in-house. \\n\\nPulled Pork ($19/lb) - pork butt. Pulled pork is not a traditional Texas barbecue item. Try the Carolinas?\\n\\nEXPERIENCE\\nMy friends and I fell in line at 8:30AM. There were close to 50 other people in front of us on a Thursday morning. We were early enough to not only use the lawn chairs Franklin's provides to the early-bird customers we also got to try Legend Coffee nearby. Had my friend made his request several weeks in advance we could've taken advantage of preordering, which would have allowed us to skip the line. However, part of the Franklin Barbecue experience is to wait in line. Notably only POTUS 44 was able to skip the line.\\n\\nThe restaurant opened at 11AM sharp. As early as 9am someone from the restaurant took orders so staff can assess the day's stock to orders. This also will assure later linegoers if they are guaranteed any of their world-famous brisket. You'll then repeat your order at the counter as they will prepare your order for you. Pitmaster etiquette dictates samples of brisket as a reward for waiting in line. \\n\\nThe seating is limited but by the time you order tables will free up to sit. Don't be afraid to sit communally as you will have waited in line too long to waste more time finding a good table. At the tables napkins and sauce are provided. Pickles, onions and white bread are notable complimentary sides.\\n\\nTo this date Franklin's has served up the best barbecue our group has ever had to the point that this experience has ruined subsequent barbecue eating for life. I have never eaten such a moist, tender and flavorful brisket up until now and a lot of that is due to the quality of the meat and leaving the fat on. It also doesn't help that spareribs and sausage are also the best barbecue of its kind I've ever eaten. My dad makes a killer baked pork rib rack and only Franklin's ribs is better than that. Meats also did well over the next two days as we converted the leftovers into breakfast tacos, a notable Texas breakfast item. Sides and dessert were excellent; my friend and I enjoyed our pecan and bourbon banana pies two days later. We enjoyed our barbecue over the Texas native Big Red soda, a bubblegum-like cream soda.\\n\\nComing from California, a region not well-known for their barbecue, Franklin's was a life-changing experience. This was my first REAL introduction to REAL barbecue from one of the traditional barbecue regions of America. It is a shame that to experience barbecue that comes close to this in quality and taste I would have to shell out the cash and travel at the very least as far as the Midwest. If it were not for my friend's observations I would have missed out my opportunity to try barbecue while on vacation in Texas for a week, and for this I thank him."},{"name":"Captain Ankeny's Pizza & Pub","address":"116 SW Pine St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Me and my family just came today for the first time to try the pizza and it was fire!

It's the best brisket in the whole world.  The problem is the line up.

I don't think it's cool to do that to customers that take the time and fall in line.  They need to do something because this formula does not work and it's unfair.  Maybe do a line for togo customers and perhaps have pre-maid stuff that we can take home and heat up?  At least give us a choice but anything is better than being turned away after spending all that time in line.  Anyway now to be on the safe side, I go to La Barbecue.

Somehow our quick lunch turned into a 2.5hour lunch.  Some of us wanted hot pot vs. sushi - so not all our meals came at once.  To top it off - both grills weren't working.

Their juices are made from 100% real fruit and veggies and you can see them make it right in front of you with their juicing machine! You get to choose any combination of fruits and veggies to make your juice. A few of the options are kale, cucumber, apple, pear, carrot, celery, beet, pineapple, pomegranate, etc. \\n\\nTheir bowls are also completely customizable. A regular Goodbowl is around $10, which is actually very reasonable because you can add a bunch of different produce to your bowl and it's all displayed in front of you. Then you pick your protein: beef, chicken, pork, or tofu. Prawns are available as well, but it's about a $4 increase in price.\\n\\nOnce you've selected your ingredients, you can then choose from a variety of different sauces. Again, you can choose and mix as many you want or you can go with one of their mixes. Once you've customized your bowl to your liking, they then cook it for you on their huge Mongolian grill! It's fun to watch them cook your food. Within a few minutes, it's all ready to go!\\n\\nI really enjoyed my food and juice! Everything was fresh and the cook on my bowl was great. I love the idea of having all of these different options available because you can create a new meal every time. Especially their large selection of signature sauces, which is what gives the food their distinct flavours! Overall, a really satisfying and pleasant meal from Goodbowl. It's the type of meal that isn't oily and won't make you feel too heavy afterwards. The food is actually quite healthy but tasty at the same time! The service was friendly as well. Even though it's not a typical sit-down restaurant where someone takes your order at your table and serves you food, the staff were very attentive and asked if we needed any water and so on.

Whether you are in a small or large party, I highly recommend making a reservation here on weekend nights.  The space was packed from when we arrived around 7:15 until where we left at about 9:30. \\n\\nSo obviously start your meal with the fried green tomatoes. The stack of fried green deliciousness is served on a most amazing roasted red pepper sauce. Also the tomatoes are stuffed with just enough goat cheese to make the dish extra extra special. I also tasted a friend's bank scallop appetizer.  It would be perfect with a salad for someone who isn't too hungry or someone who doesn't love traditionally Southern food. \\n\\nI ordered the famous fried chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes because when in Rome ya know. The chicken lived up to the hype and I now get why they are famous for it.  First time diners should be required to order it.  I thought the potatoes mixed with the collard greens (and collard greens juice) were better than the chicken itself. The she crab soup and shrimp and grits also got a lot of praise at our table. \\n\\nService was fantastic. Our waitress timed everything out perfectly for us.  Our waters and drinks stayed filled all night and they were happy to accommodate a last minute addition to our group. At the end of the meal, she brought a complementary piece of cake out for our friends birthday.  We all had a bite and lordy that cake was good.  I got a coffee after supper that was one of the best I have had in a little while.  I think the pricing is completely reasonable for the quality food and the portion size. \\n\\nParking is the only tricky thing about South City.  Parking is strictly valet and the traffic on crescent can get truly out of control.

With people being more cognizant of what they're putting into their bodies and more vegans popping up in central Florida, The Greenery Creamery is a great place to bring a friend group because there's options for almost everyone on a certain diet.

It's not just a sweetened flour mix like a regular cone.\\n\\nThe black ash ice cream tasted good with the cone, but on its own it has a weird filmy texture as it melts in your mouth. I'm assuming this has to do with the type of fat they use to make it vegan. The crunchy cone helps to mask that texture.\\n\\nThe lavender honey ice cream is complex and almost savory. The lavender flavor is strong so if you don't like herby tastes, steer clear. The basil crystals were weird, but that's what I was going for.

Fantastic food, killer cocktails, and superb service combine to make this place a total knockout. I took one point off the food for the lackluster cheesesteak wonton/dumplings as I found them to be a little too close to a Hot Pocket for my liking.  Otherwise, Ward 8 was pretty much perfect.\\n--\\nThe steak tacos were awesome and overflowing. The chicken was dry, however, and they skimped on the poutine gravy. I enjoyed my beer and there were lots to choose from. The service was especially nice and they were very accommodating of my early arrival. \\n--\\nOur waiter was amazing.  A large group with people coming at different times was accommodated early and expertly.  Then there's the food - the beet salad I had was not at all what I was expecting but was great!  It was light, with citrus dressing, and had a great crunch.  I definitely didn't think that that was the salad I was getting, but was very pleasantly surprised.  I had the mac and cheese for my entree and it was very good, too, but I admit I was looking longingly at some of the other entrees.  Both the chicken and steak frites entrees looked awesome - I'm definitely looking forward to going back and sampling other parts of the menu.  Finally - the decor was pleasant.  Dark and warm with a bit of an industrial vibe. I'm looking forward to my next visit.\\n--\\nSouthside gin and mint cocktail was excellent. I enjoyed the tuna tartar it was served with perfectly crisped and lightly salted taro chips. The steak frites had a great char on the exterior and was cooked to perfection on the inside, the blue cheese butter topping did not disappoint. The staff checked in frequently and the service was very good. I liked the massive industrial light fixtures and wood floors, . I am eager to head back and try other entrees\\n--\\nI LOVE WARD 8.  Food was excellent and creative and the cocktails stood out on top of the [great] food. My moscow mule was icy cold and minty and the barware was enviable. You can't go wrong with the restaurant's namesake which was perfectly balanced and light despite its rye roots. Maple chili duck wings were sweet, meaty and falling-off-the-bone tender. The roast chicken boasted a fragile and crispy skin and the polento-poutine-concoction it was served with was interesting and addictive (though could have benefited from a little extra splash of gravy for moisture). Latecomers were quickly \\"caught up to speed\\" with drinks and apps. The decor is industrial and, let's face it....a little NYC-hipster, but also warm and romantic. Dollhouse-sized chairs too small for grown asses prevented a 5 star decor rating, but overall a comfortable, delicious visit which would be great for groups, dates, drinks with friends .\\n --\\n I started off with a Moscow Mule, which came out in the traditional cup, and was delicious - I could have had 3 of them and called it a night.

My make-up-for-the-appetizer sliced steak chopped salad was not the compromise i expected, but a delicious blend of fresh veggies and a perfectly cooked and seasoned steak in just the right proportions.\\n--\\nI was a lush and had two drinks and a main. The Lion's Tail and Prescription Julep were spot on. Great tasting and packed a punch. The Chicken and Polenta Poutine was super comforting but needed more gravy.

We'd looked at their offering before when we went to Lotte, and this time we pushed the button for a friend's birthday.  This is your boutique Korean cake shop, the local version of Mozart Cafes, for those who are familiar with those in Atlanta. So we weren't expecting Walmart pricing; but even mindful of that, I had to say 'ouch' when I found out it was $29.99 for that bitty thing - the slightly larger ones would set you back $40 minus a penny. \\n\\nPrice and value consideration aside, we had great expectations when we sampled it.  In the famous words of Eliot (Journey of the Magi), \\"it was (you may say) satisfactory.\\"  Delicate, never too sweet (hallmark of good Korean pastry-making), and moist, to be sure, I came away muttering \\"too muted\\". There was not much that's terribly complex or mind-blowingly delicious - it was so \\"subtle\\" that there wasn't even much of a mocha taste to it. I can't help but wonder: did we just pick the good-looking one (but no substance), or are they all pretty much like that. We could continue sampling, but it may be a pretty expensive proposition.  Just think: if my wife and I eat that cake in 4 sittings, it figures to be $3.75, retail.  At a restaurant, they'd have to sell it for more than $7.50 a piece, since there's no way they'd even survive, never mind make money, at 50% food cost.  So is $9 or $10 a fair price for that piece of cake?  Hmmm - I wonder.\\n\\nThey also have a lot of other great-looking baked goods.

The rice that came with the enchiladas was really rock hard, I wasn't sure if that was part of the experience? And I personally found the refried beans a little too salty. The other dish I tried was the flautas de pescado, which was a little too greasy yet also dry at the same time. The fried tortilla to filling ratio was also a little lacking IMO. \\n\\nI didn't hate the place but personally won't be back for a typical weeknight meal.

I'm guessing the five stars are from either morons, idiots, or people trying to be \\"ironic.\\"  There is a special level of hell for perpetrators of this kind of garbage.  They'll be taking laps in  Satan's Olympic sized pool o' flames, fire and brimstone along with the owners of Cheesecake Factory, Applebee's, and Dick's Last Resort.\\n\\nLet's begin the hatefest, shall we?\\n\\nThe official laundry list of why Border Cafe might be hell on earth:\\n\\n1.  It's about 85 degrees in there at all times.  I like 85 degrees, when I'm on the beach or on vacation or when I'm in a sauna, but not when I'm getting ready to try to choke down what passes as food at this joint.\\n\\n2. It's so fucking crowded with douchebags, people with babies, women trying to pick up douchebags, and Harvard undergrads trying to get a margarita without getting carded you can't breathe, let alone move.\\n\\n3.  The margaritas are really sub par.  Not well mixed.  Not salted properly.  And I'm pretty sure they use the same margarita mix you can pick up at Stop and Shop.\\n\\n4.  Hey waiter guy- do you really need to check our IDs again when 1) we are all clearly in our late 20s, early 30s; and 2) we are still carrying around out shittily mixed margaritas?  No, not really but thanks for making us dig those out again for the umpteenth time that night.  Really appreciate your thoroughness and attention to detail.  Too bad you didn't extend such skills to actually getting the drinks we ordered to us.  C'est la vie.\\n\\n5. The food.  Any place but Boston and this shit on a plate would not be tolerated.  I don't get it.  Bostonians are generally known for a few things: being assholes, liking the Red Sox, throwing tea into the harbor, and being wicked smart 'cause we all go to all these fucking colleges in town.  The last item on the list (and heck, even the first) does not compute with Bostonian love of all bad Mexican food.  It's like we have a complex- we don't think we deserve good Mexican food so we go around eating this shit thinking it's the best we can do.  We have low Mexican food self esteem.  Can't we all just agree to go cut ourselves, take the angst level up a notch, and then demand a fucking good TexMex place in Boston or Cambridge city proper?  \\n\\n6.  I've cracked the recipe for their queso dip.  Go to the Stop and Shop (so you can also recreate their margaritas), head to the processed cheese aisle, pick up a pound of Velveeta, throw in a bottle of ChiChi's salsa and set it to nuke in your microwave for five minutes.  Voila!  Bon Apetit!\\n\\n7. And don't get me started on their Creole/Cajun offerings.  It's even more offensive than the Tex/Mex they throw on your plate.\\n\\n8.  My husband, while trying to push his way to the bar to get us drinks, hears this: \\"Hey Brah, watch it dude.\\"  Brah.  For realz.  It appears that Brody Jenner and the Bromance crew hang out in the bar area of Border Cafe on Friday nights.\\n\\n9.  There is an hour long wait to eat in this hell hole.  A full 60 minutes.  Longer if your group is on the large side.  You can count on 90 minutes for your standing pleasure.\\n\\n10.  There's a Tom of Finlandesque cowboy mural on the wall in the basement.  Oh wait.

Nowadays when I want the best BBQ I naturally think about Franklin's first.  I've been a fan ever since they were born and have always felt the need to spread the gospel due to their excellent track record for top notch BBQ and service.  Unfortunately on this weekend it just wasn't the usual 5-star performance due to breakdowns in customer service and my very salty brisket.\\n\\nI got there at 10:15am to find 50+ people already waiting in line.  Wowsers.  These guys are growing exponentially, and when you grow so fast so quickly it heightens the probability for errors.  I am excited as I get to Mr. Meat Cutter himself after a 2hr wait, he is always consistent - - very friendly and eager to please.  I have a laundry list of orders for my friends (Franklin Virgins):  three 2-meat plates, turkey sandwich, sausage sandwich, and some extra pork ribs.  For the plates I got a combo of ribs, lean and fatty brisket.\\n\\nService was excellent up to this point, as usual this guy is extremely friendly and happy to serve you, however my experience starts to take a gradual decline.  I am cognoscente that it is very chaotic up here and they are moving as fast as they can, and since I get several different items and combinations I ask the next employee of he could please mark each item so there is no confusion.  I get a blank stare from him, so I repeat my request back, and again I could tell it's not resonating.  The register gal was listening in - - a good thing because she chimes in and re-communicates my request to him, so he grabs a sharpie and improves the visual management.  Cool beans.  \\n\\nNext up - register gal rings me up, and since this is to-go I ask for extra BBQ sauce.  For my 3 plates + 2 sandwiches + ribs she gives me 3 small cups of expresso and 3 small cups of sweet sauce.  She asks if that's enough, it's not (someone will miss out), so she gives me 2 more of each.  After this I feel a little better, but then she asks me again:  \\"is that enough, or would you like more?\\".  I respond:  \\"well, I love your sauce and I always run out, so if you're going to offer more then I will certainly take you up on it\\".  She then sharply responds (with attitude):  \\"well, lemme see here, the problem is that we have other people waiting in line and they want BBQ sauce too.....\\".\\n\\nOkay.  Well you offered nicely, and I accepted, so why am I getting flack for that?  After waiting in line for 2 hrs and dishing out $52 for BBQ I felt quite disenchanted with her sarcastic attitude, it was unwarranted but I held my tongue since it was busy and I gave her the benefit, however, her comment and attitude bothered me the entire drive home.  Unappreciative?  Maybe.  Stressed out?  Most likely.  But I never ever got treated in such a manner like this before, and I didn't see a sign limiting the # of sauces to go, and if I spend that much on BBQ should extra sauce really be an issue?\\n\\nThe final blow:  I get home and take a few bites - - the ribs and cole slaw were perfect, the sauces rocked, but the potato salad was quite bland and my fatty brisket was so salty that I could not eat it and had to toss it out, and I was really bummed about that.   It was a 2.5 star experience but I'll round up to 3-stars since everything else was good and you don't expect these things to happen at Franklin.  You see, I could care less about the long wait or the confused employee marking my food, but the Negative Nellie attitude and salty brisket shouldn't be part of the wonderful BBQ experience."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I went here late for drinks after meeting up for a business dinner while in town.

It is located in Harvard Square (near MIT and Harvard), so expect the average age to be about 20-25.\\n3. It is very noisy.

The tortilla chips are so good that you need to restrain yourself from munching out on them to leave room for dinner.\\n\\nWith that said, I've ordered the Blackened Catfish, Fajita, Blackened Salmon, Crawfish ettouffe.

My husband got the alfredo with chicken and it was some of the best alfredo I've ever had! In total for lunch we only paid about $25 which wasn't bad at all given how much food we got.\\n\\nWhat I liked about Bambinelli's is that they make all their pastas and sauces daily and you can tell.

We're talking BBQ after all, right?\\n\\nIt's a down home, old school place. Lots of wood, nothing fancy.

Amazing is all I can say!!!\\nI am going to say that I'm not a fan of the coleslaw. For me it was a bit too vinegar-y. It's clearly a vinegar based slaw, and in my opinion it was too much vinegar.\\n\\nThe service was very prompt, attentive and fun, so I'll give them very good marks on that. Also, considering that we had a group of about 12 of us, the food came out very fast, so props on that too. I know, it's BBQ. Chances are it was cooked overnight and held, thus lending to fast service times. But still, it's worth noting that our wait was not very long, and the food did not taste like it was held for hours on end. So high marks here. I'd definitely return given the chance."},{"name":"Wild Magnolias","address":"15424 Fm 1825, Ste 240","city":"Pflugerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Alright I've been here a couple times now. The swamp fried and Cajun pasta are good. Same flavor. But, the fries they use have been old, stale, undercooked or something both times I've had them. Second time I got them it was a mix of good and bad fries. Not happy w that. My mom (her first time there) had the fish plate. She was told it came w shrimp but she didn't get any. She wanted Mac n cheese as well but at 5:30 pm they were out. By the time she got her food minus the shrimp she was over it. Also, Idk who does or does clean but the restroom was disgusting and didn't have soap. Great way to start a meal. I asked my mom if she would come back and she didn't answer me. She thought about it but didn't give me an answer lol."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"For such a large crowd on a Saturday night I was expecting to be \\"wowed\\" by my food a bit more.  Th she-crab soup was probably my favorite dish that came to the table.  Rich and creamy with a great crab flavor.  The pimento cheese starter (served with house pickles, celery, and crackers) was fine but nothing outstanding.  The hanger steak over Tuscan kale and fingerling potatoes was well cooked and tasty, but a bit small.  The steak was ordered medium-rare but came to the table closer to rare or \\"blue\\".  It was brought back immediately and came back cooked perfectly, kudos to the chef for not overcooking it.  Service was friendly."},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food here is great! I highly recommend! I recommend the dinner plates.

Now it's always crowded during the weekend so I try to crave it during the week when it's not as bad but still a moderate crowd or wait but it's sooo worth it. I love the food(smoked wings). When you walk in it can be confusing. There is a tight space when you first walk in for carry out and dine in. If you don't like a bit confusion to start off your dinner then I would recommend calling in if they ever pick up(the reasoning to why I gave 4 stars and not 5)!"},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I was in the area to see a movie at the theater next door but due to traffic we missed 15 minutes and decided to go to the next show. To kill time why not have lunch and some libations. \\n\\nThere is outdoor seating but we chose indoor because it's so hot. As soon as we stepped in I was greeted and told we could seat ourselves. The bar is to the left. There are bar tables with high chairs and there are regular tables and booths to the right.\\n\\nI fell in love with the place almost immediately. Why? It was intimate and had a familiar bar smell that took me back to my home in Philly. The only problem I have with place is that we were virtually ignored for 20 minutes aside from a young lady bringing us water when we first sat down. I can understand everyone being busy running each others tables. But someone should have noticed our table had nothing on it because we sat close to where they pull food from the kitchen. \\n\\nWe were finally taken cared of by Karen. She apologized to us and we ordered Lemon Drop Martinis and Calamari. The bartender in there is the bomb. That drink almost knocked me on my %$@&. Yes it was that good. We both ordered Angus Burgers no egg with salad and fries. Best dang burger I've had in a long time. So so good. \\n\\nMy dessert was Kalua Cheesecake. They dressed the plate up for me for my birthday. It was delicious.\\n\\nThis is the kind of place that only the local folks who live in the neighborhood would know about. It is a gem. They also play live jazz music. Ohhh I felt like I was in New York in the summer time. It was all so lovely. Everyone was in a fantastic mood. I will definitely return."},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"132 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Super slow service. About 3 minutes and then another seven to eight minutes take our orders back to the kitchen. If then took an additional 40 minutes to get our order.

After our meal, we gave the waiter both of our cards to split the bill. A couple of minutes later, the waiter returned and told us he had \\"lost\\" both of our cards. Apparently they must have both fallen out of the checkbook. The manager assured us he had multiple staff looking for our cards but they never found either card. The manager comped our meal, which was nice because we gave them our only form of money. I had some hope that we would be called with news that our cards would be found, but two weeks later I guess I must assume the cards \\"disappeared.\\" I gave two stars because the food and drinks were good.

I can't say enough about this restaurant. It is upscale and a wonderful dining experience. We came in as a family after a wake and they were able to accommodate our party of 11 with two tables right next to each other. We had two small children and the servers were more than happy to get them started with crayons, some drinks, and crackers right away. The servers are incredibly knowledgeable and really care that you are happy and satisfied at the end of the meal. I loved the fact that I could order \\"off the menu\\" by substituting cavatappi for penne noodles. I was also able to add vegetables like broccoli, mushrooms, and peas to my entree. It was DELICIOUS!! The sauces were creamy and spiced to perfection. The portions were huge. There was enough leftover for lunch the next day. My husband had the Special of the Day which was lobster ravioli and it was fantastic. The portion was a little smaller but he was still full at the end of the meal. They have a nice bar area where we went to enjoy after dinner drinks. They had craft beers and made great mixed drinks. We were only in town for 5 nights due to a funeral, but we ate there twice because we liked it so much. We didn't try the desserts, though. We were just too full after our meals to eat anything else. Definitely a must if you are in the Concord area!!"},{"name":"Oz Asian","address":"3579 Lake Emma Rd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4.5","text":"I went there to have sushi and they had a limited sushi menu.

The waiter was excellent, was helpful in recommending something for our toddler. Food came quickly. We thought it was quite pricey for what it is. $80 for 4 breakfasts with coffee. The eggs come with \\"duck fat\\" fries rather than breakfast potatoes which we think sounds really gross.
