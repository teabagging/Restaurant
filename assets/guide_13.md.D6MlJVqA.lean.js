B√°nh m√¨ is a Vietnamese term for all kinds of bread. Tr√®s Bon in the French language means 'very good'. The name of the cafe can be loosely translated into \\"Very Good Bread\\" or \\"Delicious Bread\\". Bread (especially the baguette) was introduced to Vietnam by the French during its colonial period in the mid 1800s. The cafe is a blend of Vietnamese and French fusion food, with a seating for about 20 guests. The interior is designed in a feminine French style with a small cozy lounge in the corner. The service was slow on a Saturday afternoon, so it would probably be better dining in on a weekday. The staff were polite and checked to see if guests were happy with their meals. The restaurant prides itself on clean eating, because its menu announced it served grass-fed hormone-free beef with no MSG in their food.\\n\\nThe Savoury Mini Crepes was a visually attractive appetizer. The round gold crepes were nicely presented in a cast iron escargot-style skillet. They stayed very hot inside the skillet, so take caution on the first few bites. The crepes were crispy on the outer sides, and soft in the center. Pouring fish sauce onto the crepes brought out the salty and sweet flavors, otherwise the crepes would taste bland on their own without the sauce. They were topped with fresh onions and fried onion flakes.\\n\\nThe Pho Tai Bo Vien also came nicely presented on a set wooden tray and the bean sprouts in a small fishing boat. The golden broth was very clean tasting and included beef balls, beef steak cuts, and a chunk of bone marrow. The bone marrow was a nice touch in the Pho bowl. The restaurant said that their pho is served authentic, and its broth is created by simmering beef bones, toasted onions and ginger, and a variety of spices for hours.\\n\\nThe cafe also serves tea in beautiful little teacups and macarons on small colorful trays. There were red and yellow macarons with red bean butter cream and dark chocolate for Chinese New Year. Their macarons and desserts are brought in from a local Vancouver French bakery, but everything else is made in-house. The cafe has limited seating - there is one large shared table at a corner, and a few tables that are crowded very closely together. It would be more advisable to come in on a weekday to get your pick of the table and avoid the crowds."},{"name":"Dang's Thai Kitchen","address":"670 N State St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant isn't perfect, but I appreciate Dang's for going the extra mile and being a little more stylish and interesting than most of the other Thai restaurants in the area. This is tablecloth Thai cuisine; not grab and go.\\n\\nRather than being stuck in strip mall, Dang's has a good location along Highway 43 with ample parking. They've done their best to add a little style to a former coffee shop and have a nicely appointed dining room and a separate banquet room for private functions. The plates are stenciled and the tableware has heft. I love the stone carving of the tropical maiden and the wood cut of the elephants. Also, check out the royal portrait in the entryway for a little regal splendor.\\n\\nThe lunch menu is diverse and in addition to your basic curries and noodle dishes, Dang's offers some appealing specialties. The Tom Yum Noodle soup (not to be confused with the standard Tom Yum soup) is the best version I've had anywhere and it is served in a playfully oversized bowl. The rich and creamy Khao Soi is also in my regular rotation. They serve beer and have a decent wine list. You will pay a little bit more for the Lake Oswego razzle dazzle, but most lunch entrees are still in the $7 - 9 range.\\n\\nMy first experience was on New Year's Eve and the entire family enjoyed dinner. The standout from that meal was the Yum Nuar (grilled beef salad w/lemongrass and mint). My most recent experience was with fellow Yeeps for a group lunch. In both cases, I really enjoyed the food, but the service was a bit on the slow side. Again, not recommended for a quick bite to eat.

The first time I was put on hold (forever) by this lady and I had to hang up.  I figured, fair enough if they're smoking busy.  The second time, another lady picks up but due to the miserable weather, my cell phone reception cut off. No matter, tonight I will have my Lamb Butter Masala, Ras Malai and Gulab Jamun.

There was one server running around.  Although it seemed to me that the dine-in customers were getting treated well, I found the take out service a bit wanting in terms of friendlier customer service.  I walked in to stand at the counter for an awkward 5 minutes because the gentleman behind the counter was chatting with another customer and a lady who popped out from the kitchen to say a few words in Indian to him.  Nobody even greeted me.\\n\\nMy food bill came to $27, ordering two portions each of the dessert (so 4 ras malai piees, 4 gulab jamun donut pieces and a small order of the lamb curry).  I found it quite pricey for the amount of food and the area they're in, but otherwise the food tastes like your standard Indian fare, not horrible, but not spectacular either.  I say in today's economy, spend your money somewhere else with better service and better food.\\n\\nOh well.

It is solid black and at first I just looked at it thinking there was always next time, but I went ahead and tried it, hoping it wasn't anything remotely sea-life-ish. It wasn't, it was sort of tasteless.

Moist, crispy, tender, delicious sauce, I could go on, but I'm drooling at my desk. We tried the fried pickles, rabbit and dumplings, and short rib croquettes, all of which were very good.

Both were large portions and tasty. Our server was excellent. She was attentive, energetic, and friendly. The reason for the 4 star rating versus a 5 is due to us finding a hair in our Brie that was neither of ours .

Found a good deal on a night here via Priceline. Paid just under $65. Great considering the nightly rates on the hotel website are nearly three times that price.\\n\\nThe location is awesome. It is just two blocks away from the MAX station which is served by three different lines. And in the last year, a new Portland Streetcar line (CL) has opened that runs on the same street as the hotel. There is a stop in close proximity to the hotel. The hotel offers parking for a somewhat high fee ($18 self-park or $21 valet), so if you arrive in Portland, I would say that taking public transit would be a better option. Especially since a day pass is only $5.\\n\\nThe lobby of the hotel is beautiful and modern. A nice touch is the complimentary coffee and tea they offer here. I had arrived at the hotel several hours before the check-in time, but I decided to take a chance to see if a room was available. Fortunately it was and I could check-in early.\\n\\nGot a room on the top floor with a decent view to the east. The room was quite large with room for a sofa and coffee table. The hotel facilities seem to be well acquainted with a fitness room with the essentials that I was able to utilize. There is also an indoor pool as well.\\n\\nThough there are many nice amenities, there were a few dings about staying here. I had a lot of trouble with their Wi-Fi. I was not able to use it for most of my stay. Particularly had trouble accessing Yelp. Go figure. It only started working later that night and in the morning the next day.\\n\\nThere are also a few items that were missing from the room including a fridge and a hair dryer which were available in the other two hotels (with a lower star rating). The layout of the room I stayed in was a bit awkward as well. Specifically, the bed was not facing directly towards the TV unless you wanted to turn your body sideways to see it. Nor was the sofa in close distance to the TV either.\\n\\nI will say the quality of the rooms are better than the other two hotels that I stayed at, but it feels like they are missing a few comforts here.

My first visit was because of a Traditional Chinese Wedding Banquet and my second being a Dim Sum visit.\\n\\n I came here for a Chinese Dinner Wedding Banquet, with about one-hundred guests in attendance.  The blessed event served 10 both very beautifully and delicious dishes, each one having an amazing presentation and it's on unique flavor to in honor to this celebration.   I have been to many of these banquets, especially recently with all my friends getting married, and they are all good, however, something you notice when attending banquets with a large amount of guests is that by the time one of the dishes come out, it is cooled because it takes so long for the back of the kitchen to plate all the dishes for all the tables.  However, this was not the case for this banquet.  Hei La Moon executed this very well, where the dishes came out very timely to all the tables, making it so the dishes were hot. \\n\\nBecause of the great experience that I had with the banquet, I came back here for Dim Sum with visiting friends from out of town.  This too was done very well.  We came on Saturday, and had to wait 30 minutes for a seat.  FYI for those who are not familiar with Chinese Dim Sum and weekends in China Town, it's very busy, so expect to wait a bit and also be prepared to share a table with complete strangers.  However, the wait and sharing the table with another group of customers is so worth the food and the experience of having Dim Sum.  It was actually because we were sharing the table with a group of strangers, that my friends from out of town saw some things that they were interested trying and ended up liking very much.\\n\\nThe Dim Sum dishes here are very good, there are a lot of options and the carts being pushed by the staff are moving around very quickly, making it so you can get your items quickly.  If there is something you want and had not seen yet, you can flag down one of the staff with the vest, and let them know what it is you are looking for, and they will bring it to your table.

For me, this was an exercise in observation while waiting for, admittedly, the best brisket I've ever had. \\n\\nAs awesome as the BBQ is, it's the law of supply and demand that rules supreme here. Franklin Barbecue is open 6 days a week (closed Mondays) 11 a.m. - sold out. This amounts to roughly 3 hours of lunch service per day, which leads to the I've gotta have it frame of mind and daily ensures that the perimeter of the restaurant looks like a feeding line at the local soup kitchen. If there was greater access and increased availability, the line 'experience' would disappear, as would the hype. There is a carefully orchestrated image at play propelled by great product but ultimately more so by INCREDIBLY LIMITED opportunity.\\n\\nBy the time people get to the front of the line, they're staring at the meats with their I'm-not-deranged-just-drunk-and-starving eyeballs. After this many hours it had better be phenomenal 5-star food, and if it's not, you're too famished, desperate, and delirious to notice or care. Up until this point, it's been one prolonged tailgate party complete with coolers, lawn chairs, frisbees, and other amenities you'd find at a campground. Contrast this with a few Ubers dropping off late-comers, mouths opened and stunned, clearly disappointed that this won't be quick like the Jack in the Box drive-thru.\\n\\nThe line is mainly tourists, as I'm told very few self-respecting Austinites would make a habit of spending half their day here, not when there are boatloads of other formidable BBQ options in town at half the price that don't involve queueing up at 6 a.m. for a shot at lunch. You wait for about as long as it will take you to digest what you're going to eat here. How's that for a visual?\\n\\nWhere was I? Oh right, the moment of reckoning. Once you get to the end of the rainbow, you'll encounter a friendly leprechaun (yes, singular) hand-carving cuts of beef, pork, turkey, and other meats for you by the pound and placing them on a cafeteria tray lined with butcher paper. Napkins double as plates, quickly soaked through by drippings from some of the moistest brisket I've ever seen. \\n\\nMeats at Franklin are seasoned and then slow-smoked using oak wood in smokers located behind the restaurant. I had brisket, pork ribs, and pulled pork, all tender, moist, and fabulous with the brisket serving as the star in the trio, as everyone says. The fat in the brisket is evenly distributed and marbleized throughout the entire cut, giving each piece a flavor profile I have not experienced before. There are sauces provided in the small dining area as a courtesy, but they're not needed as the taste and moisture of the meats speak for themselves. \\n\\nWhat I do know is that I won't eat BBQ like this again until my next visit to the southern USA. With such a strong BBQ culture in Austin and other parts south it's unlikely I will give up nearly 3 hours of my life again to happy-hippo binge eat here in the future, but if feasting at Franklin Barbecue is on your foodie bucket list like it was on mine, I'd recommend the trip at least once."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The best bbq in the whole world.

Normally, I would venture over to Community BBQ on Clairmont, but I was on this side of town at Lil 5 Points. I ended up here to order some takeout. I had been here once, years prior and wasn't a fan, but decided to give it another chance. I ordered at the To-go window after telling the hostess that I didn't need a table. Once I ordered, I wasn't expecting much of a wait, so i told the cashier that I'd be back after I used the restroom. Came back less than 5 minutes later and proceeded to wait at the to-go counter...i.e...the entrance. After telling many Patrons that I was not in line and simply waiting for my food, one of the hostesses told me that I could sit across from the bar and they would call my name when my order was ready. I told her that it was so loud in the restaurant that I didn't want to miss my order and she reassured me that it was fine. So, after standing at the door for about 8 minutes and then sitting by the bar for another 10 minutes, I noticed a man call out an order for the couple that ordered waaayyyy behind me, so then I decided to ask him about my order and he told me he'd check on. Low and behold...my order was ready a long time ago during the 5 minutes or less that I was in the restroom. At this point, I was highly upset because the cashier and/or hostesses could've told me that while they were standing there discussing non-business related things. Instead, I decided not to make a fuss about it, even though they forgot my drink that I ordered and I had to wait for that some more. So I ended up spending over 30 minutes on BBQ that is pre-cooked and by the time i got home, the food was cold. I warmed it in the microwave and like my first time, I was not impressed. I ordered the meat combo with ribs, wings, mac n cheese, and potato salad. The wings were great! The ribs were small and kind of dry. The sides were just OK. After giving this place another shot, I have come to the conclusion that it does not live up to the hype. The lack of customer service really took my rating down a notch, being that the food wasn't bad, but not great either. If you want a great meal, please do yourself a favor and head to Community BBQ where the food is delicious and the service is great...I'll try not to cheat on community Q going forward."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Pros: Food is great!

I noticed they added a few items to the menu, so my husband and I both tried something different. He ordered the Duck Leg and Waffle and I ordered the Banana Cream Pie French Toast. We're we ever so glad we went with the new items?! Omgosh those two dishes were excellent. I can't say enough... when you see my reviews of this place you would think I've invested in this restaurant lol but it's just that good! \\n\\nOk I'm all over the place but whenever I go for brunch or breakfast, I never order a sweet item UNLESS I am able to share a savory dish with another person. I have to say Oeb is the only restaurant I will gladly order a sweet dish even if that's the only thing I'll be eating. They're all so delicious, well balanced, and not overly sweet. I'm always full when I leave, but I never feel disgusted - I'm sure you know what I mean by that. Sometimes at other restaurants everything is so delicious but I feel gross afterwards because the food was either too heavy, salty, etc. without me noticing it at the moment. At Oeb I never feel like that :)\\n\\nBack to reviewing the individual dishes we ordered today- the Duck Leg and Waffle was a generous portion with a delicious syrup drizzle on the plate for the waffles. The duck leg had a nice crispy skin and the meat was very juicy/tender. The waffles were perfectly cooked- crispy on the outside and fully on the inside. It came with a sunny side egg and pickled veggies which accompanied the duck leg perfectly :)\\n\\nThe Banana Cream Pie French Toast is now my favorite sweet dish. The French toast was fluffy with tons of fresh bananas, topped with a generous amount of whipped cream. The toasted almonds gave the dish an extra bit of nutty deliciousness and added a nice crunchy texture. I can't wait to go back and order it again. Please don't take it off the menu Oeb!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I've heard so many things about this fab place and just had to give it a try for breakfast. I have heard there is always a wait, so we arrived right at 9am. Sure enough there was a long line, but they shuffled us in within 10 or so minutes. We were within the \\"first wave\\". Once the place was full, I could definitely see how a wait is probably eminent. Tip #1-Arrive before 9 if you don't want to wait.\\nThe ambience was fun, but it was a little cramped and definitely too loud. The prices were decent and the portions were plentiful. I ordered the infamous chicken and waffles and it was delicious. There were 3 perfectly fried chicken breasts on the top of a sweet potato waffle with a knife holding it all in place. The chicken was spicy and a little peppery, and perfectly cooked. The waffle was average, nothing noteworthy. This dish is certainly big enough to share, or if not sharing plan on lots of leftovers.  My friend ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy. The gravy was full of flavor and obviously made from scratch. My friend wasn't fond of the biscuits because they weren't really \\"biscuits\\". They weren't dense or crusted on top like a traditional biscuit. However, I LOVED them because I am not a biscuit fan and they were definitely different. They were light, fluffy and full of air, reminded me of the texture of coffee cake more than a biscuit. The hot chocolate was real and amazing and the other meals looked equally as delicious. \\nWould I go back? Probably, if I was in the area, but I certainly wouldn't drive that far again unless it was for a special occasion. I think it is definitely one of the better breakfasts in PDX, but I don't think I would crown it the \\"best\\". I think that everyone should give it a try at least once.

Instead, when we mentioned how disappointed and frustrated we were with the meal being wrong and the wait to receive the corrected one, the server got very defensive and blamed me for how I didn't order it correctly. He made it a point to show me his notes where he didn't write no sauce on it, proving nothing.

We got there at 11:15 AM on a Friday and the parking lot was already filled. They only had opened 15 minutes ago, so that's saying something. The hostess informed us that they usually have a line outside before they even open their doors at 11 AM, how many restaurants do you know have a demand like that?! We parked in the neighborhood exiting the restaurant parking lot to the left. The manager informed us they're working on building a larger parking lot, just having slight trouble with getting the approval of the surrounding neighborhood residents.\\n\\nWe decided to share the texas fries w/ brisket and a 12 piece smoked wings. They were phenomenal, and filling between the two of us. I wasn't sure if I would like the smoked wings, because usually places leave them too fatty. However, they were cooked perfectly and the ranch with them was really good as well. As we finished our lunch prepared to order dessert, two managers at different times came to our table and asked how our meal was. They both were the standard of management all restaurants should have period. Both were personable, and shared their thoughts on their menu favorites. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the newly added red velvet cheesecake. One of the managers shared that they had stolen the pastry chef from the Ritz Carlton downtown, so you know they're doing well to have talent in their kitchen of that caliber. My mum and I shared the red velvet cheesecake, a generous portion, and it's hands down better than the one they serve at Cheesecake Factory.

I can't speak for their other items, but I definitely plan on trying more from their diverse menu in the future. I wouldn't recommend the \\"cheesy\\" bread sticks. They are not cheesy at all.

The first time I ordered I didn't realize there was a 50% off coupon, but they applied it anyway which was a nice surprise! You get a free side of sauce of your choosing and banana pepper with every pizza. (Although, every time I've specified I wanted garlic sauce they gave me the default marinara sauce, but not a big deal!)\\n\\nThey are also a bit snobbish about tipping. I live right upstairs so of course I choose pickup each time.

Mind you this was after waiting 10 minutes trying to get the waitress' attention, and having to finally go up to the bar to get a new glass after being ignored. A different waitress came back with the same wine in a new glass and rudely asked, \\"was it just the butter on the outside of the glass that you had a problem with?\\" Really? It doesn't really matter what it was on the glass, you served it to us that way and that's unsanitary. And the same wine? Very low brow. \\n\\nAnyway, we loved the romantic setting and the food.

It opened March 2000 and is owned by the same group as Canoe. Located in a small white building surrounded by hedges and a big tree, it's easy to miss this restaurant on the corner of East Paces Ferry Road and Maple Drive. The entrance is in the back next to the valet stand. Valet is complimentary.\\n\\nThe restaurant isn't terribly big, consisting of a small bar and a single dining room with two sections of seating. The interior design is nice, but also a bit strange. From the entrance, you have to walk through this curtain of heavy beads through the intimate bar/lounge to the white-colored dining room filled with classical columns and avant-garde decor. There's a bizarre light fixture in the middle of the dining room which vaguely resembles a tentacled sea creature. There are two jewel-encrusted dog sculptures on either side of the steps leading to the dining room. The monochrome floral patterns on the upholstery is beautiful.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is cozy, romantic, and intimate. There are white tablecloths and candles at every table. Seating against the wall is snug and you can hear the conversations of those sitting next to you and vice versa. If you don't like this, you can try to request to be seated elsewhere when making your reservation.\\n\\nReservations are recommended. Aria is on OpenTable and has offered 1,000-point reservations at times. Take advantage if you can.\\n\\nThe restaurant's menu changes nightly. The cuisine is New American with an emphasis on slow-cooked and sustainable foods made from high quality, local and regional ingredients. On any given night, the menu will feature about 10 starters and 10 entrees. Most starters run about $10-15 each and entrees $30-35 each. There's also a pre-set tasting menu that runs $68 per person. This is less expensive than comparable Atlanta restaurants such as Bacchanalia and Restaurant Eugene ($85 each).\\n\\nI love tasting menus, so that's what we went with. At Aria, each course of the tasting menu is described on the printed menu. There are no substitutions or optional courses. Accommodations can be made for those with food allergies. Here's a rundown of what I had, course by course:\\n\\n* Bread: House Focaccia\\n* Course 1: Creamless Celery Root Soup - black truffles, Parmigiano Reggiano\\n* Course 2: Crisped Tempura Octopus - roasted butternut squash, roasted peanuts, Fuji apple, mizuna, frisee, candied ginger vinaigrette\\n* Course 3: Blue Ridge Mountain Trout - butter fondue, melted leeks, Hakurei turnips, baby carrots, fingerling potatoes\\n* Course 4: Crisped South Carolina Quail - shaved Brussels sprouts, applewood smoked bacon, grain mustard vinaigrette\\n* Course 5: Pan Roasted Loin of Venison - charred broccoli, Hakurei turnips, baby carrots, pearl onion petals\\n* Course 6: Chocolate Espresso Cake - almond toffee ice cream\\n\\nUnlike other fine dining restaurants, there are no amuse-bouches or gifts from the chef at Aria. Just one bread course and then the items listed on the prix fixe menu.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic. The House Focaccia bread was exceptional. It was freshly baked, warm, soft, and herby. Also a little bit oily, it was served pre-sliced into rectangular strips.\\n\\nThe Creamless Celery Root Soup was delicious. It tasted similar to a cream of mushroom soup, but lighter. The hint of truffles was absolutely mouthwatering.\\n\\nThe Crisped Tempura Octopus was my least favorite dish of the night. While the octopus meat was fresh, its consistency felt relatively soggy or mushy and the thin layer of tempura batter wasn't crispy. The rest of the dish was great though, from the julienned apple to the delicate mizuna and frisee greens. The delightful ginger vinaigrette tied it together.\\n\\nThe Blue Ridge Mountain Trout was very good. The skin was perfectly succulent and crispy. This dish normally came with a lobster bisque sauce, but due to my food allergy, the chef specially prepared a butter and cheese fondue sauce instead. I particularly enjoyed the tender baby carrots and sweet and fruity Hakurei turnips.\\n\\nThe Crisped South Carolina Quail was phenomenal -- one of the best-prepared quails I've had to date. The half-quail meat was juicy and flavorful. The little bird had been expertly deboned. The Brussels salad and pork belly bits were icing on top of the proverbial cake.\\n\\nThe Pan Roasted Loin of Venison was excellent. The venison was cooked medium rare. The slices of meat were moist, luscious, and flavorful.\\n\\nThe Chocolate Espresso Cake was superb. Rich yet airy. I had to eat the almond toffee ice cream quickly before it melted away.\\n\\nService was good though a bit slow. Coats were checked and silverware and plates were changed in a timely manner. We liked our server and the other staff were nothing but polite and courteous. However, course pacing could have been better and we had extended waits on the check.\\n\\nOverall, Aria is a terrific restaurant.

Buttermilk and Bourbon isn't trying to make a loud statement nor is it appealing to the rowdy millennial crowd (so far at least). I love it. The bartenders were nice, the food and drinks were phenomenal, and the atmosphere was relaxed and suave without being sleazy. \\n\\nTechnically this is tapas but there was nothing tapas about the size of each plate.\\n\\nFried pickles: large order with a side of buttermilk-cayenne ranch. Not too oily and arrived pipping hot. I should probably go get my cholesterol checked because I ate way too many of these.\\n\\nCajun Guacamole: again, a large order than arrived with blackened shrimp and house-made barbecue kettle chips. Very good (and addictive) but this would have better if the chips were plain, not barbecue. I had a hard time focusing on the guacamole, which was phenomenal, because the barbecue-dusted chips were overwhelming. Also, why the shrimp? Vegetarians might have a hard time here. Most menu items have meat incorporated into them somehow. I still ate almost all of the chips though. No shame.\\n\\nWarm Honey-Glazed Biscuits: an order of four huge biscuits salted on top with smoked cinnamon butter & pimento cheese spreads on the side.

I heard the line quickly wraps around the building so I knew I would try to get there before the lunch/church crowd. When I did arrive, there was already a trail beginning. Tents and bikes were gathered on the property from where campers had waited their turn. The ramp, going inside, was snaked around with people standing like dominoes. They even had an employee standing outside making progress updates. I waited in line for 45 minutes (very much worth it) and the only thing sold out was turkey, which wasn't initially on my mind until I heard it was sold out. Means it has to be good, right? As soon as you step one foot inside the door, the amazing smell hits your nostrils and you see memorabilia available for purchase. I ended up getting everything else. Brisket, pulled pork, sausage and ribs filled my tray as the meat cutter finished butchering a freshly pulled out slab of ribs and a whole brisket. The brisket was juicy and super tender- accompanied with the perfect smoke ring. Both lean and fatty cuts were excellent but the fatty cuts provided more flavor and juice, while not being overly fatty. Ribs slid smooth off the bone and also carried that awesome smoke flavor. The pulled pork was given to me as a sample. Typically, when I try pulled pork it's still extremely salty... not at Franklin. The smoke and salt flavors actually complimented each other- the perfect pork for a pulled pork sammie! And the sausage was delicious with that slight snap/crunch from the outer layer of the skin. I literally had no complaints and a small little wrapped up doggy bag to take home.

So I can safely say that Franklin BBQ was the BEST barbecue I've had :)\\n\\nThe wait is long, there's no going around that, UNLESS you pre-order online like a couple weeks ahead or something. It wasn't something I knew about until a few days or so before my trip to Austin, SO I didn't have the opportunity to pre-order and avoid the lines. There's also a minimum amount for pre-orders, which honestly doesn't seem too bad since I'm pretty sure I ordered more than the minimum when I actually went. So look into that if you absolutely do not wanna wait in a line.\\n\\nOTHERWISE, for all the suckas that don't know about the pre-order thing, me included, the lines seem to average about 5 hours or something lol. I got there around 7:30am, and there was already quite a line forming. The place don't even open til like 11 or something! Geezus. So they have a system going where they take down people's orders while waiting in line (only for estimating purposes - you order forreals when you get to the front), so they can estimate the amount of BBQ left for the people towards the back of the lines... if they're lucky. It's good of them to do so, so they can just tell you to go home if you're standing in the part of the line that doesn't guarantee you any food after years of waiting :)\\n\\nSo anyway, after 5.5 hours of waiting... it doesn't actually seem that bad btw. My friend and I had our phones and played a ton of games while waiting, also went to CVS to buy some picnic chairs to sit on for a good few hours lol. Also brought some snacks bahaha. WELL after all that, we finally got to the front and ordered every damn thing on the menu. I wasn't about to wait that long just to order a tiny sandwich NOPE no effing way.\\n\\nWe got: pork ribs, brisket (80 fatty/20 lean), pulled pork, sausages, and turkey. Don't remember how many pounds of each but it was at least 5 lbs total. It was a LOT. We also got potato salad and some other sides or something, and the order came with some white bread.\\n\\nThe ribs and brisket were my FAVES. I LOOOOOVE brisket, and the fatty brisket just meeeeeelts. The ribs were ripe as shiet. So tender! There were some sauces available, and I forgot which ones I like but they didn't neeeeed sauce. It was plenty flavorful, but it's also nice to have some extra moisture/flavors. The pulled pork and sausages were also extremely delicious. The turkey was good too, I'm just not a huge turkey fan, but felt like I should order it just because 5.5 hours lol. But damn, everything was so good! \\n\\nOf course 2 people couldn't finish this 5lbs meat mountain, so we made a couple meals out of it.. maybe even 3. Well, so I packed the rest to bring home to LA (had a TSA guy double check my meat-filled luggage, which was kinda funny and probably not all that uncommon right? lol), and alla that BBQ fed me for a straight week. STILL so good.\\n\\nSOOOOOO take what you will from my experience, I love this place and the BBQ, but will never again wait 5.5 hours or so for this. So if I find myself back in Austin I will absolutely plan ahead and pre-order my meats.

I'm not sure if Disney perfected it's chicken nuggets receipt, but Cosmic Ray's offers some of the best chicken nuggets in any Disney park. They're cooked to perfection. Something that really puts the chicken nuggets over the top is the new Sriracha Spicy Aioli sauce. You'll find a pump for this sauce near the ketchup, and mustard. Seriously, GO TRY IT NOW. This stuff is amazing. Cosmic Ray's is the only place in Disney that I have been able to find it. Dipping your chicken nuggets in the Sriracha spicy aioli is one of, if not the best, thing to eat in Magic Kingdom. I also enjoy the new strawberry lemonade slushy that is offered. Pay a little extra and you can get a Mickey straw with your lemonade.\\n\\nCosmic Ray's has always been a go to place for me and my family to eat, but over the years they have updated and improved their menu.

I am aware that working so close to a busy stadium is stressful and busy game days can be overwhelming however, you should know what you are getting yourself into if you choose to be a waiter here. \\n\\n1st bad experience we had was on a game day. We were a larger party-6 people. It was actually 3 couples so not too crazy to keep track of who ordered what. I drank one beer and when we got the check my husband noticed we were charged for 3. I showed the waitress and she proceeded to argue with me saying that she wouldn't have rung up a beer if someone didn't order it. I'm sorry but WHAT?!!! I'm not a dumb teenager and I'm well aware of how many drinks I got. I was pissed. She did take it off after my husband asked for the manager, but she never did get the manager for us to see. \\n\\n2nd bad experience came last Monday. Also a game day it not particularly busy. It was hot as hell and Labor Day so the battery was a lot slower than usual. We were meeting another party of 4 for lunch before the game at around 11:30. My husbands dad beat us to the restaurant so, he asked for a table to seat 8. They refused to seat him for 8 and told him that they could only seat the 4 that were there. Understandable but, we were going to be there in 5 minutes. He asked if when we arrived, would they add a table so we could sit and the hostess agreed. \\n\\nWe arrived shortly after and were told we were not allowed to be seated and that we would have to put our name on the wait list. The hostess said to my face that my father in law only asked for a table of four and obviously didn't want me and my husband and my parents to sit with them. WHAT THE HECK?!?! She lied to my face because my father in law was almost in tears because he had been looking forward to this day with our family for a long time. We don't get to see them often and this would absolutely not be the case. Crystal was the hostess's name and she basically kicked us out. At some point we put our name down and got called 3mins later to be seated. With hopes we could sit with our family e went back and crystal refused to give us a big enough table. We sat looking directly at an empty table for 8 that was also empty when we arrived the first time. It was shocking and rude. \\n\\nDespite the food being good the service and rudeness of crystal really ruined it for me.

Value is where these two factors merge and where individual taste emerges.\\n\\nFlat Patties is a fast food place in every sense of the word, and whether or not you like it is dependent on your tolerance (or love of) your standard fast food. In every way, Flat Patties is much better than your typical chain fast food place - but it is unabashedly still fast food. And foodies beware this is food for convenience and price nothing more.\\n\\nI personally have a very low tolerance for Fast Food and found myself significantly less enamored with Flat Patties than my companions who have taken me. The buttered brioche buns are a fabulous touch, but it is the greasy low-quality beef that fails to excite me, the cursory not-always-fresh toppings, and the unimpressively average fries that fails to impress. Sure it's better than Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's but not much more.\\n\\nFor the price, you'll struggle to find a better deal in Harvard Square.

The biscuits were flaky and dense rather than flaky and airy. The eggs and green tomatoes were lacking salt. And I didn't see any available salt or pepper on any station or table. And frankly didnt feel like asking for it since I already had to ask for lids and straws for the cups and utensils since weren't delivered to our table. \\n\\nMy daughter ordered the kids Mac n cheese ($4.99) and a side of grits. She said the Mac n cheese was just ok but again needed salt. Cheese was running/watery. Again the grits were the hit of this breakfast.  My husband ordered the 7th trimester which is basically a biscuit egg, bacon, gravy, and Mac n cheese. His feedback--it's ok. Needed salt. He sampled my grits and liked those.

The food itself is spiced and prepared in excellent fashion. The salad bar has nice offerings, but not overly many, and it is all super fresh and of the highest quality (the items are gourmet, such as grilled vegetables, marinated mushrooms, palm hearts, tabouli, various pasta salads). The hot 'carb' options were Brazilian style rice and black beans, mashed potatoes, and bread. Those were good, but I tried to stay light on the carbs since I wanted to indulge the meat side.\\n\\nThe first time there, they offered pork and chicken during the rounds, but on a Thursday at 6:30 pm they only offered steak and lamb options until about 7:30 when one offering came around of chicken sausage and of pork. I had a Groupon deal both times I went. All of the meat was superb cuts and taste. Various states of done-ness would appeal to most visitors. To be honest, the waiters kept coming around with the same cuts over and over again, and I'm sure were a bit impatient at being told \\"no\\", but we were waiting for something different.

Well done! \\n\\nHighly recommend the place, as the food is stellar... but for the amount that I personally could eat and the variety, I could not see paying full price for this. The  taxes and gratuity added up to $18.60 and we paid about $40 for the groupon, so it was still a $60 meal. Well worth that price.

My expectations are very, very high when it comes to BBQ.

We got: \\n\\nFirst and foremost, the night we went for dinner, there was live music, which was definitely fun! \\n\\n_ 1/4 Rib and 1/4 Chicken Combo 11.95\\nI think the price is absolutely worth it. And the flavor is good. The ribs fell off the bone and I LOVE that! So why the three stars? For flavor alone, absolutely I'd have given at least 4 stars, but the ribs and chicken were lukewarm. Maybe because we came here rather late in the evening, but the meat did not seem to be right off the heat. At best, it seemed as if they were under a heating lamp that didn't do a good job at heating up the ribs and chicken, unfortunately. The food got cold rather quickly.\\n\\nAnother negative in my opinion, but this is no fault to the restaurant and I did not knock off any stars for this. I understand that this is how they do BBQ, but I am not a huge fan of wet rub BBQ. It was slathered in sauce, which is fine, but I am definitely more of a dry rub fan. The sauce was thick, kind of like a ketchup consistency. Personal preference, but if there's going to be any sauce on the meat, I'd like more of a liquid consistency, that of say hot sauce or a thin gravy. I also find it a bit funny that even though the meat is slathered in sauce, they still give you a little cup of BBQ sauce. \\n\\n_ Chopped Pork Sandwich 5.99\\nMy bf got the chopped pulled pork sandwich, and he definitely chose the right dish. His entree was definitely better than mine. Yum. I took a bite and really enjoyed it. When we go to a BBQ joint, chopped pork sandwiches are usually his go to.

On a Friday, there were no open reservations until 9:45 PM, so we just showed up at 8:30 and were seated about 15 minutes later. Sweet!\\n\\nTruthfully, this place was a bit difficult to find since it is in the lower level of the building and there isn't yet a permanent sign. But once you do find it - wow. The space is impressive and much larger than you would expect. And full to the brim with happy people. The decor is simple with a contemporary flair, and I especially enjoyed the open kitchen.\\n\\nDuring our wait, we squeezed ourselves over to the bar, and they offer a great variety of libations. The Hot Tiger's Milk caught my attention right away, and it tasted like all the things you would want in a winter drink - milky, sweet, ideal blend of spices like cinnamon and orange. It's one of those drinks your mom would make you on a snow day. Plus rum.\\n\\nOnce seated, the waitress explains that the restaurant's dishes are primarily small plates made for sharing and that typically they recommend 2-3 plates per person. In my experience, tapas places always recommend to order more than I can eat, so we just pick 3 to start out with and we'll assess our hunger (and wallets) as we go.\\n\\nInstead of bread, we are served some cold, pickled green beans with sesame seeds. Although I wouldn't order or crave this dish, it was unexpected and served as a nice palate cleanser without being filling, showing that their focus is on taste and experience. Cool, guys.\\n\\nNext up was the Ubiquitous Kale Salad, which was a slam dunk. Amazing texture! Leafy, crunchy. And that dressing! Creamy, nutty. Gotta love pistachios, amirite?\\n\\nThen comes the beef neck, which was a much smaller portion than we were expecting, but presented absolutely beautifully atop a parsnip puree and adorned with tiny purple flowers (yep, flowers are in our food). The meat is so tender you can easily cut it with the fork, and the flavor was nice. Beefy. The crisp parsnips on top provided a nice balance. Overall a solid dish, but I wouldn't necessarily get it again, especially considering the price relative to portion size.\\n\\nLast up were the corn pancakes. This was also something to look at, as they're served with popcorn kernels and jalapenos. The cakes themselves were both savory and sweet, with a nice little kick from the peppers, although I would have liked some more spice. Again, an interesting concept which I'm glad I tried, but it didn't blow me away.\\n\\nAfter the three dishes and two drinks, we were pretty full! So I recommend starting out with 1-2 plates each and then going from there instead of ordering a bunch all in one go.

But it was inside. The building space has been creatively utilized to say the least. The tables and chairs were those 1970's seats you used to see in libraries which also set an interesting tone. It's definitely not an elegant or refined aura. But, I thought, the food will make up for it.\\n\\nOur menus were two printer pages stapled together, smudged with food. Another unimpressive touch. We settled on a bottle of wine that was better than average, however the wine selection did not offer a wide price range. Basically, you could get a $20 bottle of wine or a $70 bottle. There were hardly any red wine selections in between.\\n\\nThe salads we ordered were amazing. The greens were perfect (the types of lettuce she uses in the salads can sometimes be extremely bitter if not selected at the right time - these were perfect).\\n\\nThe entree was extremely disappointing. We ordered a filet, which was drowned in an overpowering sauce. There was very little art to allowing the flavors of the food set the tone for the dish - it was all about sauces and spices.\\n\\n For a chef to insist upon no alterations to her dishes, she has not yet proven her expertise, and therefore has not earned the ability to be this presumptuous. \\n\\nAfter dinner, we has a seasonal gingerbread cake that was out of this world. No wrong could be done on this desert. \\n\\nOverall, the entrees are weak.

If you would like to elevate that to the next level, grab a seat at the chef's table and watch the magic happen in the kitchen as you dine on some of the best-balanced food in the Greater Boston Area. \\n\\nGlancing at the menu or walking down the stairs to what appears to be a basement dive does not prepare you for what you are about to experience at Alden and Harlow. As you cross the threshold you are immediate hit with a dark ambiance and wafts of spice and smoke coming from the kitchen. The place has a strange balance of dark wood and modern touch that can be found in all the trendy new restaurants, which can either create excitement or reservation within the individual (depending on their personality). \\n\\nI was intrigued as we didn't have reservations but were offered two seats at the chef's table, guaranteed a show and some lively conversation (which they were correct on both points). Our team of servers promptly greeted us, offered to take our drink order and plopped down a few menus. After briefing us on the daily specials, they told us about the \\"house favorites\\" and what guests often order when there is trouble deciding. \\n\\nUpon initial view, the menu looked disjointed and without a flow or actual \\"theme\\" of the cuisine. However, what we came to experience is that instead of pigeon-holing themselves into such a box, the chef utilizes what naturally accompanies the locally-sourced food and allows the ingredients to shine instead of forcing them into a particular \\"style\\" of preparation. The hot-smoked steelhead trout, countneck clams, patatas bravas, and pickled corn pancakes were all unique dishes around very common ingredients in the area. The treatment and deft hand of the dressings and sauces were there and paired to simply \\"pop\\" the natural flavor of the main ingredient, not hide or muddle it. We shared about 6 dishes and that was plenty of food for the two of us, who often are observed at eating more than most other couples. \\n\\nThe servers (and chefs) were friendly, prompt, and attentive during the entire meal. There was never a point when we felt neglected, shunned, or had an empty glass (water or wine), which is a testament of service when considering how much liquid I can consume at a meal. \\n\\nThings that may be viewed as potential negatives that I read when doing research on the establishment but personally did not experience: \\n- It was viewed as a more pricey restaurant in the area\\n- Waits can be long and reservations can be hard to come by\\nWhile both of these can be true, I find the value that A&H offers to be above many other places in the area even if they are at a lower price point. On the reservation front, I've found that every place in Boston worth going to comes at a price of having to wait or planning ahead. This is not unique to A&H or Cambridge or even Boston... so you just need to be able to deal with those facts when trying to dine out. \\n\\nOverall and from a final rating perspective, A&H is easily top 5 in places we've dined in Boston. While the price can feel a little steep, it's a better value when you consider the number of restaurants that command a premium in the area as well as Boston. Further, there isn't a thing on the menu that you can order and not be fully satisfied after eating.

We waited a couple minutes to be greeted at the host's desk, but were seated immediately as there was a table open. \\n\\nNow, I read from other reviews that this place is known for their soju cocktails. We, however, decided to get a bottle of the fresh and grape flavored, keepin' it simple. Drinks were cold, and we definitely didn't take that for granted. We decided to share a jokbal dish, and that is where things started getting serious. We were gonna put Sojuba's authenticity to the real test by ordering that fresh jokbal. We. were. not. disappointed. It was warm, soft, and chewy - gave us flashbacks of the motherland. \\n\\nSomething we thought that could have been better was definitely the long wait time for the food. Although the music selection was on point, it was so loud that we were basically shouting at each other across the table to hear.. but the volume could be a good thing, depending on the party you're going with! \\n\\nAll in all, this place is the go-to if you're craving some soju in a hip environment.

In the center, they were serving four choices of appetizers.  Each had a seperate line.  One station served pulled pork and a small square of bread.  The second station served chicken salad with a small square of bread.   The third station served baby carrots and ranch dressing.  The final station served canned tropical mixed fruit which was not good.  In the back of the room was a bar.  $15 for any drink in a 20 oz. Pirates Dinner Adventure glass.

I couldn't hear everything they were saying and therefore couldn't follow along with the store-line.\\n\\nDuring the start of the show, the server came around and asked if we wanted soup or salad.  I opted for salad which was a scoop of salad - nothing fancy.  Ranch and Italian dressing were the only two options.  Pitchers of coke and sprite were on the table.  I didn't try the sprite but the Coke was completely flat.  Once it ran out, we had a hard time getting it refilled.  Once dinner was served, the servers pushed industrial metal carts arounds.  They had to help each other lift the carts up the stairs which looked to not be any fun.   I had the beer option. I was served two skewers of beef chunks that were seasoned with a sauce.  The beef was mildly dry.  It came with a few roasted vegetables in the skewer. With the dinner tonight was seasoned rice and mixed vegetables which were good.  I asked for more napkins and didn't get them until I asked a second time.\\n\\nPlates were cleared and dessert was served. Dessert was a square of chocolate cake with chocolate drizzle and a dollop of whipped cream.

She then passed out trays that had a note laminated and taped down inside of it.  The tray was asking for a tip for the server.  It was suggested that you tip $5 per adult and $3 per child.\\n\\nOverall, I thought the experience was over priced - even with their discounted Easter special for April which was child's admission for everyone.

Or what is the point of getting an egg on a burger? I remember we went somewhere once, and the fried egg was over hard. That egg yolk needs to be bursting. I thought everything was pretty tasty.

It was a big waffle made with sweet potato, topped with three large fried chicken breasts. WOW. Amazing. Wowowowow. My friend and I only was able to eat 2 of the 3 chicken breasts. So yummy, moist and flavorful! The waffle was outstanding... especially since it was made out of sweet potato.

We saw on Instagram they were having $2 Tuesday, and it was family owned. We love to support different restaurants in the city and show our appreciation. Everything was going great. We were enjoying our selves. We noticed our waiter was a little absent. It was like we had to flag him down each time it was time to ask a question or even put in extra. When you're a waiter you should be attentive at all times. I was a server for over 4 years. We were always taught to be attentive. We ordered two drinks along with the $2 shots. The shots were \\"Golden Toro\\". Then we order a margarita and a another mixed drink. The margarita came with no salt no lime. So I immediately asked \\"Is this the margarita\\" and he replied yes. So I just was like okay I'm not gone trip. But when my husband tasted his drink... It was very nasty. Like Yuck nasty. And we are not the type that want any confrontation so we just asked if he could switch the drink. The drink was still full and he just had brought it so it shouldn't have been any problems returning it. The bartender looked as though she was very upset that the drink was being sent back. By this time we are like okay maybe we shouldn't have sent it back because we don't want any problems. Our waiter finally came back and said it will be remade. Over 20 minutes went by with out the drink. We got our food.. started eating and then received the drink. Okay we start enjoying our selves and feeling the vibe. We noticed a waitress started putting up tables why we were still sitting so we just was like okay we will just take our food to go cause they were about to close. It was only 11:20. So we get the check. We immediately look at the check and was like wait this isn't right... We calculated all of the things we ordered and it added it to be $58. Yet our check was $75. Then we noticed it was a $10 gratuity added. Me being a server knowing that when you add gratuity it should be a large party of 6 or more. It was only me and my husband. Our waiter \\"Rashad\\" argued us down about this. He said the policy was \\"if you spend over a certain amount of money, gratuity is automatically added\\". I was like who in world came up with that. So during the argument, he goes on to say \\"So yal wasn't gone leave no tip\\"?????????? We were looking like okay dude who trained you. You are never suppose to ASK for a tip. Your service speaks for itself. So by this time I ask for the manager. Rashad goes on to say \\"I'll just take it off, I already took off the drink so yal should be good with this ticket\\" me and my husband look at each like what in the world. We clearly see two charges for the two drinks we ordered on the ticket. So Rashad proceeds to take off the gratuity. He comes back with the ticket. The ticket was only $1 short of what it was before so at first it was $75. Now it was $74. I'm like Sir WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER. Because you are about to really upset me now. He never would get the manager. He proceeded to take everything off. Our total finally came out to be $62. Which sounded about right knowing that without tax it was $58. Adding liquor tax and food tax should have bumped it up but not to $75. I hate when I feel like you're trying to con money out of someone. We were going to leave him a nice tip until then. Food was great but that service from the waiter \\"Rashad with the tattoos\\" was down right low down. And we will not be returning because of this reason.

Honestly, I've been here three times already to have three different groups of people try the food they all loved it too. It's a great place for groups or even a date night. They have outside seating and couches that are a great spot in the summertime (if you can grab these seats). \\n\\nI enjoy the southern New Orleans vibe and I've tried several of the dishes on the menu and haven't had anything that's disappointed me yet. \\n\\nI have nothing bad to say about the biscuits. I felt like I had to try them at least once. The biscuits are warm, big, and honey-glazed so I enjoyed them. The smoked cinnamon butter goes perfectly with the biscuits, but I was not a fan of the second option. \\n\\nIn terms of my favorite dishes, the top two would have to be the fried chicken sliders and the new Orleans bbq shrimp. The flavors from both these dishes are amazing! I don't even like shrimp, but I tried a little bit of this dish when one of my friend got it the first time and I wanted to devour all of it for myself (sadly I couldn't since it wasn't my dish), so the next time I came here that's what I got. Personally, I like the chicken sliders way more than the buttermilk fried chicken. The sauce and the dressing on the slider is so wonderful. However, get either and you won't regret it. \\n\\nNext would be the buttermilk fried chicken and the prime burger sliders. Go for the boneless thighs over the wings, they're so much more enjoyable. The reasoning for the burger sliders is similar to the chicken sliders, the dressing they add make it taste great. \\n\\nThe Gouda mac and cheese with the hot cheetos crust was also surprisingly really tasting. The cast iron rabbit and dumplings were alright but not something I would get again. It is one of the larger portion sizes in comparison to other dishes and there's a decent amount of rabbit, but I was not too crazy about the soup-like mixture and the dumplings were very similar to the biscuits so nothing really memorable. \\n\\nThe fried beignets were fluffy, delicious, and a great way to end the meal. \\n\\nCon:\\nThe only downside would be the dishes are a bit on the pricier side for the amount of food you get. I opted for dishes where you get more bang for your buck, which is why I haven't tried the short rib croquettes or pig cheeks because I didn't think it'd be worth it.

After having poor quality brisket at another bbq restaurant in Houston the day before, you can really tell he uses top quality beef.\\n\\nSausage was excellent as well.  It's crisp, juicy and the links are small.  It reminded me of sausage from elgin.  The pork ribs were pretty peppery, tender and juicy.  You can't go wrong with any of those meats.\\n\\nBbq sauce comes in 3 different bottles on each table.  A light, a medium and a dark sauce.

I ordered a vegetarian ramen, and when it was being made something seemed off to me, as the girl making it was scooping broth out of the same pot I'd seen her scoop for a non-veg one. So I asked multiple times if the broth was vegetarian, and if it contained fish or dashi, and she assured me it was vegetarian and did not have fish, though it did have dashi (which doesn't make sense since dashi is literally a fish broth). I also want to point out that the sign did not say \\"Veggie,\\" ramen, it specifically said vegetarian.  Well, eventually an older guy in the back who had clearly overheard us talking said casually \\"Oh yeah, it has fish. They all do.\\"  When I asked why they were blatantly lying to their customers, he just shrugged and said \\"Oh we just forgot to tell you.\\" This was obviously just him lying to my face, as even if the girl serving me had \\"forgotten\\", me asking her to confirm in three different ways would have no doubt jogged her memory. Needless to say, I asked for a refund right away. If I had ended up never asking, and eating the ramen, I would have become extremely ill.

We shared the Edamame and fries, so it was essentially like we got an appetizer anyway.\\nI knew for my meal I had to try a Burgushi: Burger-Sushi hybrid. I'm a fan of a creative gimmick, no shame!\\nI got Doug's Filet Roll: Avocado, kani, and cream cheese inside, then topped with thin slices of seared filet mignon and masago. \\nI feel like in retrospect, I shouldn't have let the waitress talk me out of the Taste Explosion Roll. Doug's Filet Roll was alright, but the filet mignon was a bit overcooked, and the flavor profile left me wanting something more Wow.\\n\\nI'd love to go back and get apps, try the Spicy Poke Dip or Blackened Tuna Nachos.

Honestly, I'm impatient and am not the kind to wait more than an hour (more like 30 min.) for food, but somehow I convinced myself to wait five hours for BBQ. It's probably because: 1) it's famous and highly rated -- and as a foodie, I must try this place or else i'd be dishonoring my title and 2) most claim that it was worth their time and that yes, Franklin has one of the best brisket out there.\\n\\nThe whole 'Franklin' experience (as I like to call it) can be broken down into 3 parts:\\n\\n1. The Beginning\\n\\nThis is where you'll spend most of your time - waiting and daydreaming about you'll be eating. As you probably already know, come prepared - bring entertainment, snacks, beer and lawn chairs (or a picnic blanket). Find ways to make the time fly by. My favorite part about this whole experience is meeting people. My bf and I befriended our neighbors, which made the 5 hours fly by. \\n\\nDuring this part, there will be one person coming down along the line who will tell you about the process. Then another person will ask each group what they're planning to order to ensure that there is enough food. Therefore, if you get there late, they will let you know if they think there isn't enough for you. They will also give you a rough estimate of what time you'll be eating. They're pros so believe them when they say you'll be eating 5 hours later. \\n\\n2. During \\n\\nThis is the moment you have been patiently waiting -- the moment where you begin to salivate, the moment where your heart begins to race, the moment you get to take the first bite of that meat. \\n\\nWe got the sausage, brisket and pulled pork. As expected (and as it should be given how long we waited), everything is d e l i c i o u s. The sausage is plump and smokey. The pulled pork is moist. For the brisket, you can order lean or fatty so we got both. The fatty brisket (as everyone describes it) is like butter - it melts in your mouth and falls off your fork perfectly. The lean brisket is tasty as well, but no where near heavenly as the fatty brisket. \\n\\nAll the BBQ sauces on the table are delicious. The espresso rub sounds odd, but its roasty notes went well with the brisket's smokiness. \\n\\n3. After\\n\\nThis is the part where you'll walk away feeling 10 lbs heavier. This is the moment where you feel your body slowing down, trying to digest all the meat you just ate. If the food coma doesn't hit you within 30 min of consumption then you're doing it wrong. It means you didn't eat enough food! My bf and I were too tired to drive back to Dallas after Franklin BBQ that we had to find some nice shade to picnic after. \\n\\nAll in all, was it worth it? Yes, but it's not something i'd do again. Five hours is way too long, but it's definitely something worth doing once."},{"name":"HOTLIPS Pizza - Pearl","address":"721 NW 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"One of the spots my friend recommend I try while in Portland.

Atlanta - you have a good thing going with Fat Matt's.\\n\\nMy family came in for a brief vacation at the end of June.  We rented a car, and drove straight from the airport for a late barbecue lunch.  Even at three o'clock the place was doing respectable business.  I would expect a wait at more normal hours, and I'm glad we didn't face one.  Fat Matt's is a small place, truly a shack, with a counter for ordering and a good amount of tight seating.  I liked the homey, cheerful atmosphere.  The d√©cor is blues-themed, with paintings of famous musicians all over the walls.\\n\\nService was friendly, and the food came out quick.  We also got a pitcher of Yuengling beer - the draft selection is better than you'd expect from this kind of pre-Yelp era hole in the wall.  This went well with the barbecue, and was refreshing on a hot day.\\n\\nThe food was excellent.  We shared a full slab of ribs, a chopped pork sandwich, and a quarter chicken with a bunch of sides.  The ribs were the main event, as the name of the place might suggest.  The meat was juicy and flavorful, with just the right amount of sauce, and it slid off the bone at the touch of a lip.  I can't think of a place where I've had better ribs.  The chopped pork sandwich was also delicious, the pork moist and saucy, served on a soft burger bun.  Even the chicken was worthwhile - the meat was never dry, and it tasted great.  Our orders came with fluffy white bread and Fat Matt's tangy barbecue sauce, which we did not spare.  The sandwich also came with potato chips, which we took for the road.\\n\\nThe sides deserve their own paragraph.  We got \\"rum\\" baked beans, mac n cheese, collard greens, coleslaw, Brunswick stew, and to snack, a basket of roasted peanuts.  The \\"rum\\" baked beans were the winner here, stewy and savory with a mild sweetness that deepened the barbecue flavor.  The Brunswick stew was also wonderful, hearty and loaded with beef and tomato.  The mac n cheese, collard greens, and coleslaw were more typical but all very tasty, and the fresh roasted peanuts were a real treat.\\n\\nWhen I was deciding on where to eat in Atlanta, I had a hard time choosing between Fat Matt's, Fox Brothers, and Heirloom Market.  I decided on Fat Matt's because my fianc√© (my own (lean) Matt) had been before and liked it very much.  I'm sure he would've liked the others fine, and I'm sure I would have too, but I will now continue to recommend Fat Matt's.

I am no fan of grits but I could eat those grits anytime of the day. My cousins ordered the BFF Fajitas Burrito (a special that was served only on the weekends) which was stuffed with roasted potatoes, tender chicken, and eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. Needless to say, that was consumed so quick that I barely got a chance to steal a bite (made sense because the burrito ran out before I could even put in my order). My brother ordered the 7th Trimester that consisted of eggs, bacon, and creamy mac and cheese shells. It also looked like it was sprinkled with a bit of potato chips for texture. The 7th Trimester was hands down my favorite meal. The bacon was perfectly crispy, the shells were flavorful and there was just enough sauce to not leave the biscuit drenched and soggy. \\n\\nThe coffee was delicious but the orange blossom tea was even better.

It's clear they have the cook down to the science and that it's still feels \\"small batch\\" even after expanding from a truck to the space they've for the last few years. Obviously, there's a lot of great BBQ joints in Texas, and you might prefer others, but there's a reason why people brave the long lines. A lot of people still have their mixed reviews about Franklin, but what people cannot deny is that the staff really does put the work in and how nuanced the cook has to be to achieve their results. During this trip, we tried La Barbecue, Salt Lick, Micklethwait, Terry Black's, and Stubbs, and nothing really came close to Franklin. Also, I would not recommend eating smoked meats for 4 days straight. Oof. \\n\\nYou can decide whether or not you want to wait in the line at 6am, but I would just pre-order a couple weeks in advance. You might not get that Franklin tailgate experience and free brisket samples, but you might get a few extra hours of sleep and the same quality barbecue. The waitstaff understands that you're super anxious to get that barbecue, regardless if you're waiting hours or not, and they are really kind and accommodating.\\n\\nBrisket: Best brisket I've ever had. Great balance of fat, and it just has that juiciness and balance of firmness and tenderness. They gave us some burnt ends too, which I appreciated because they weren't doused in sauce, and you can tell the difference in texture from the actual brisket.\\nRibs: Echoing the brisket, with the right balance of tenderness. A lot of the time, ribs that are fall off the bone can be dry, but not these. We ate these, cartilage and all. \\nSausage: Delicious and fatty, just like everything else. Salty for sure, but worked well with all the other meats and sides.\\nTurkey: Great recipe, solidly moist. This is likely less popular compared to the brisket, but don't count it out.\\nPotato salad: Vinegary and delicious. Sourness really cuts through the fattiness of the meats.\\nBeans: Super solid. Need some fiber with all that BBQ, heh.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should eat here, in case the other reviews didn't convince you. And you probably shouldn't be friends with anyone who said that they didn't like this place.

That being said, there was a lack of cheese and the chicken was a tad dry and relatively flavorless. The ramen with pork belly was great! Love the amount of pork belly included (it'll definitely fill your belly). The ramen has a very interesting taste though. Don't know if it's missing a bit of salt, but it's a little bland.

There were a few bits here and there that were packed with juicy layers and soft fatty meat. But there were other bits that were a bit dry. The dry bits were canceled out with their sauce. The brisket DID have a red ring around the slices, which was pretty impressive. I had a hard time not comparing it to my favorite BBQ spots in Texas. Texas wins. \\n\\n- turkey: it was juicy. I was impressed that it wasn't dry at all. but, unfortunately, i do think the turkey needed the sauce as the flavor wasn't super strong. it was there, but just needed a bit more. \\n\\n- ribs: THE ribs. were. amazing. fall off the bone, very flavorful. this was definitely my favorite part of the entire meal. it came with 4 meaty ribs. absolutely must order if you come here. I will say, even though I tend to compare all BBQ to the ones I had in Texas, the ribs held its own. \\n\\n- baked beans were delicious\\n- brunswick stew was SO GOOD. the waitress started listing the things that were in this, and it felt neverending. my eyes widened and i had to get it. I felt like I cheated the system because there were some pieces of pulled pork in there. \\n- mac and cheese: good flavor, but wasn't ooey and gooey, which is disappointing but unless it's freshly made and served right away, that's a high expectation that will always be unmet.\\n- collard greens: good flavor as well, and had a bit of a kick to it. great! Recommend. \\n\\nThey have two Fox Bros. sauces available on the table. One mild, one spicy. The spicy BBQ sauce has a bit of a kick, so if you like it spicy, definitely use it! \\n\\nAlso, I asked, and they DO allow you to do 1/4 lb cuts, which I think I will do next time so I can get more a variety to try. I could do without the sides (though they ARE delicious), just so I can spend my money on the meats!! They have a LOT of variety when it comes to sides, and there are a few I would like to try next time too though. So who knows! \\n\\nThe waitress was really friendly and answered any questions we had. We came around dinner time on a Sunday, and they were busy! But we got seated right away, which was really nice. It seemed like there were people waiting outside, so it might have been because they were a bigger group and we were just 2."},{"name":"Freebirds World Burrito","address":"1100 Center Ridge Dr Blgd 3, Ste 380","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Tried this out as a recommendation from a friend.

There are several great choices in the area, but we went with Mario's because of the truly nice lady who answered the phone (Rino's didn't answer at all). \\n\\nWhen we got here (parking is horrendous) we were greeted by that sane nice lady who said it would be a few minutes.  It is a small room and was packed with big, loud family tables. Like a communal Italian dining room for several families. Loud, boisterous and happy people all around.\\n\\nAfter our wait we were seated and the food started coming very quickly. Bread and butter, oil, parmesan and red pepper flakes. Cans of soda. Then an uninspired salad drenched in dressing made me question maybe we had made a mistake here... \\n\\n...and then the veal and chicken parm came and everything was resolved. Spectacular. Crispy, delicious, covered in a truly fantastic sauce and great stretchy cheese, this rivals anything in the North End or Federal Hill in Providence.  \\n\\nIronically, the decent portions of the proteins and a small side of (really great) pasta in that sauce made this special. Fantastic. In lousy restaurants they give you lots of pasta, it's cheap, to distract you from the average food. This dinner is so good, you wouldn't really miss the pasta. But you'll want  more because it's so good. \\n\\nNormally the unevenness of the first parts of the meal would take this review down a star.

I went to the bathroom after I ordered, and the food was already at my table when I came out. \\n\\nI tried the 1/2 slab or ribs with \\"rum\\" baked beans. The ribs came with extra sauce, which I think is different from what they put on the ribs, a bunch of ribs, and 2 white bread slices. \\n\\nThe sauce it came with has a slight kick with a bit of sweetness. The ribs were falling off the bone. In fact, it fell off the bone so easily, you can scrape the meat onto the white bread slices to make your own sandwich. Make sure to add the sauce too.

The sweet caramelized onions go well with the bleu cheese. I'm not sure what Foster Sauce is made of, but it has a good tangy flavor that seems to go pretty well with everything.\\n\\nJohnny Apple Brie - Also ordered with a veggie patty. Another sweet and tangy savory combination burger. Pretty good. The housemade dijonnaise (tangy mayo) really makes it.\\n\\nRose City - Wasn't sure if I'd like the pickled beet, but it just adds a little sweetness to balance with the brie and the tangy dijonnaise. I liked it.\\n\\nGrilled cheese -- Added egg and bacon and saved it for breakfast. Pretty good, a bit greasy though.\\n\\nVeggie burger patty -- Has a great veggie burger flavor.

F#%^ me sideways and call me Sally Joe... Okay, well that wasn't a very classy sentence... And this restaurant is absolutely, positively classy... But whatever, I just cannot control myself when trying to explain the deliciousness that passed my lips when eating here. \\n\\nWhen we were first presented menus, I won't lie... Nothing really stood out to me. I was actually nervous a bit too because the menu seemed extremely pretentious, thus I thought the kitchen wouldn't be willing to accommodate my food allergies. That being said, I asked politely and sternly for menu items prepared a specific way... And our server at one point was like, \\"you probably should go with another dish since the BUTTER is what makes the trout tasty\\".... To me that comment was sad. It made me sad because it showed me that our server doesn't in fact appreciate clean and lean foods for what they are.... He seems like the type to get BBQ or grilled salmon and then pour sugar over the top... Ugh. But I stuck with my order and said, NOPE, I'm just fine with the trout, thanks... However LET ME BACK UP A HOT MINUTE. I also ordered the wild boar ribs.... Without the BBQ SAUCE. \\n\\nBEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. \\n\\nWhen they arrived they looked perfect, and far tastier than the order we got smothered in BBQ SAUCE. And let me tell you... The flavors were TRIPLE ORGASMIC... No but seriously. These ribs were coated in a cinnamon rub that blew me out of the water. I wanted to order 10 more plates... And honestly if I did that, and I was alone, my bill would probably have been cheaper than what the bill actually was for the party I was with (4 people total). I savored my wild boar as much as I could but I still managed to wolf (ha ha good call back) them down before everyone else, thus I was sitting there, waiting for everyone else to finish their appetizers. I honestly wanted to just RISK MY LIFE, pounce on the table and eat the remaining BBQ SAUCE LADEN wild boar ribs because gahhhhhhhh they were beyond good.

I can't even describe the perfection that was this skirt steak... And the French Fries, and I quote \\"are the best French fries I've ever had in my entire life\\".... I don't eat French Fries but I even snagged a tiny shoelace fry to see what all the fuss was about and um, WHOA. However, if you don't like salt then these may not be your favorite. Also if you don't like salt... Then I don't like you.\\n\\n- Elk: Seared to perfection, not rubbery at all. Simply phenomenal. As good as elk can get, and I've eaten a lot of elk in my day. \\n\\n- Beef Tenderloin: SUCCULENT and Devine!!! My fianc√© and I noticed that the person who ordered the steak wasn't going to finish his meal, thus we POUNCED ON IT like hyenas (you see why I'm marrying him?

It tasted like heaven... Unless you're a vegan, ha!\\n\\n- Rainbow Trout: AWESOME! Butter sauce and other side option.... SO NOT NECESSARY!!! Our server is ridiculous. I also got a side of asparagus that were grilled to utter perfection and paired amazingly well with this fish! FIVE STARS! FIVE... \\n\\nOh gosh...

And he had one forkful, threw his fork down and shed tears of joy. He wept happiness tears as he continued to take massive bites of the sugar cookie crust topped with creamy sweet bananas and a bourbon soaked & fired banana slice.

Decided to go for lunch with him and another friend.\\n\\nFirst impression, the interior is pleasant, a real restaurant, with a lovely sushi bar facing the front door as a person enters. Beautifully fresh fish, right there. As soon as we were seated, within seconds, someone brought us bowls of miso soup and of freshly made cucumber pickles. Yum! Best miso soup we've ever had, just lovely, with strands of seaweed and little cubes of tofu. The pickles were snappy and delicious. Ate all of that before ordering.\\n\\nI got the chirashi, and Sweetie got a bento box. The chirashi was beautiful, and delicious. Slices of salmon, tuna, and yellow fin, and of two kinds of egg omelet (one of them marinaded in something?). Several kinds of picked veggies. Shrimp, octopus, and (the only flaw) a small length of krab (not crab). Served over freshly made sushi rice. The rice alone was delicious. A little wasabi and soy sauce on the side, and I was very happy.\\n\\nThe bento box included an egg roll, California roll, rice, and beef negimaki, along with a nicely cut dessert orange. Sweetie loved every bit of it.\\n\\nWe didn't order any of the specialty rolls or sushi, but next time we visit (soon!) , that's the plan. We want to try everything at Hana.

When it finally came,  the pizza was pretty good but not spicy as we thought it would be.  I'm not a huge fan of the crust,  but it was alright.

Except, I don't have to go to a game when I'm drunk and tired, I get to eat BBQ!\\n\\nOur last experience was great! Some girlfriends and I went on Wednesday morning around 10AM. The line was already way past the parking lot, but we were prepared with our coolers of wine and chairs. In fact, if you weren't prepared, Franklin has chairs and umbrellas for you to use while you wait. Since we were planning on drinking and waiting, we Lyfted there, which was another great idea because the parking is very limited. Once the restaurant opened, the line moved along rather quickly with people taking your order to ensure there will be enough BBQ. They let you know if you're not likely to get BBQ so you don't have to wait in line even longer only to be rejected. Midway through our wait, they brought out samples of their brisket sandwiches, which kept our motivation up (and we were 3 roses in...)\\n\\nThen we make it to the front of the line. The brisket, a must. Ribs, sausage, and some turkey (I really like turkey). Now, I will be honest, I'm pretty sure everything was delicious! But...I was also starving and drunk when we finally got food (around 1 PM).\\n\\nOf course there are ways to bypass the line. You can order ahead if you have a big order and just pick it up. However, I feel like to really enjoy Franklin, you need to wait in line, chat up the people in front and behind you, drink rose all day, and then eat 10 lbs of BBQ. I actually highly recommending the waiting in line. Otherwise, like the other reviews said, Austin is a great destination for excellent BBQ. There are a lot of delicious BBQ places around and although Franklin is a top contender, if you're not looking for a wait, there are other strong contenders."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

That table was empty ever since we got there. I simple can't fathom why we couldn't have been given that table (even when we were ready to order asap). My friend asked the manager about that, and I'm quoting the manager here, \\"You can either sit on this table now, or wait for the bigger table upstairs for however long you want.\\" and he simply left while my friend tried to tell him that we are not even asking for a bigger table.

Also was incredibly difficult to understand the woman who picked up the phone. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but was just so underwhelmed. I was early for my reservation, so I thought I'd grab a drink at the bar. Mistake 1. There is no real bartender. Or at least there wasn't Thursday. So I had try and flag down someone who looked like they worked there. I legitimately sat there for 20 minutes. Finally ordered my drink and instantly closed my tab, and was then told my table was ready. 10 mins early still, but I was able to just take my drink to the table. \\n\\nSo now my friend arrives and we decided to order some pickys and more drinks. We each had different menus apparently? I tried to order the Cucumber Melon drink I ordered inside. But my menu and my friend's menu were different. Again, so disorganized. \\n\\nWe had the oysters to start. They were delicious. Then we ordered the whole wheat orecchiette & honey cauliflower. The orecchiette was great. But the cauliflower was literally a large head and didn't have much flavor. Not to mention it was very difficult to share and cut. They should have served it in florets, not a large head. \\n\\n \\nAs far as table/view goes--it's great. The view of the skyline is spectacular. Our server was nice.

The dining room wasn't full but had a flow of customers, with a few sitting at the bar watching the football game with their drinks.  We were seated in the back near the wood fired pizza oven and got to see the action there.  We didn't order the pizza, but maybe next time.\\n\\nGigia was our server and she is a sweetheart.  She went above and beyond even great service.  The menu is set up with antipasti, insalate, primi and secondi courses, if you're going to mangia a full traditional Italian meal.  We opted for a mix of courses by ordering the Buratta & Prosciutto antepasti and Lentil soup of the day to start.  The burrata is not as creamy as some of the best I've had but went well with the thinly sliced prosciutto on the soft Italian bread.  When our bread basket got low, Gigia just showed up with more bread!  The mix of pastas and seafood we each ordered were incredible!  Gnocchi with pesto, Spaghetti with whole clams and Spaghetti & meatballs were all so fresh that you knew the pasta was made that same day, if not that same hour.  My wife bypassed the pasta primi course and went straight for the secondi whole grilled Branzino.  That was the one of the most awesome fish I've ever seen or tasted!\\n\\nThe dessert menu had your standard Italian favorites, tiramisu, gelato and cannoli, but I was surprised to see crepes on there.  We tried the tiramisu, which was served parfait style in a tall glass, light and not too sweet.  The nutella, banana & strawberry crepe on the other hand was heavy duty and I almost didn't finish it even with help.  A steaming cup of cappuccino was all that was needed to cap off this great meal!

I would say there was about 50 people in there at maximum. At first I thought, I put on one of my best outfits and my good heels FOR DIS? But, I figured it was still a bit early and we'd give it an hour or so before we decide to venture to the other spots in the area.\\n\\nThere was only one bartender at the bar, and there really should be two.

E Ramen + is conveniently located just four blocks from my office and I am often admiring the crowds through their glass windows on my commute home from work. Finally, I get to join in trying their deliciousness! \\n\\nParking is available in the connected garage shared with Northside Hospital. Note that when you receive a validation from the restaurant, it is for REDUCED parking, not FREE parking. My friends and I paid about $5 for just under two hours - it would have normally cost us $14. \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is modern, very clean, and comfortable. We commented multiple times on how we enjoyed the interior - it is an industrial chic look that doesn't seem too manufactured. The staff here is very nice and welcoming. We were greeted by multiple staff with smiling faces as soon as we walked in and enjoyed flawless service throughout our meal.\\n\\nOn to the food! My friends and I started with a couple of appetizers: ITS A WRAP\\" - MUST TRY!! Pork chasyu, cilantro, cucumber wrapped in Asian flatbread. We were really curious about this appetizer because of the \\"MUST TRY!!\\" in bold print next to it on the menu -- and they won us over! The marketing gimmick worked! Honestly, the wrap is very delicious. The flatbread is a Taiwanese-inspired flatbread, warm and flaky. We ordered a double order and they arrived to our table one at a time as they are made fresh and meant to be enjoyed warm. I really loved the vegetables inside the wrap and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet and creamy. I only wish it were a tad bigger so I could enjoy it more! We also tried the GYOZA: Panfried pork & vegetable & chicken dumpling. The gyoza was cooked very well; fried with a perfect crisp, and the filling is meaty and delicious. My only criticism of this dish would be that the dipping sauce needs some improvement; the filling tasted sweet and the dipping sauce was even sweeter - I would have preferred more of a tart or spicy element to add more of a contrast to the gyoza and to break up the fried oil taste.\\n\\nThe most important thing: the ramen!! Of course, I had to order the award-winning E SIGNATURE RAMEN: Pork broth, pork belly, ground pork, scallions, egg, string beans, chili oil. This was very, very, very good. I would add a thousand more \\"very\\" if it wouldn't seem obnoxious. Everything in this ramen was perfect - EXCELLENT egg (see picture), perfectly cooked, crispy green beans, pork that melts in your mouth. The noodles are cooked phenomenally well and the portion is just perfect. Most commendable is the presentation of this dish - the chili oil is perfectly placed so the broth is divided in two different contrasting, gorgeous colors. The broth has a great flavor profile and is not too oily - we kept commenting how we tasted hints of corn in the broth without there being any actual corn in the bowl. I think it was sorcery. Seriously, I am wanting to devour another bowl as I write this review. At $14.50 a pop, this is a premium to pay for ramen, but considering its Midtown and a basic B salad costs that much and this took many more hours to craft, It's totally worth the price. \\n\\nKeep up the great work, will be back again and again!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Waiting 4 hours before opening hours of a food joint sounds crazy to me, and it's by far the craziest thing I've ever done for food....But it was totally WURTH it.

It was a Thursday so it wasn't as crowded as I am sure a weekend might be but it was still summer so there were still plenty of people. There's also a bar to get some drinks at, a few tables, and a gift store along different walls.

There's also a little dance party after the show where the cast dance.

This place has a lot of selections of burgers and it's not the typical cheeseburgers. Most of the burgers on the menu sounds delicious. This place is spacious and can seat a lot of people but it still gets busy during lunch and dinner hours especially right after the park closes. But it is worth the wait. \\n\\nOn our first visit we came around 6 pm and was seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. She remembered the side I ordered and corrected it when the other staff gave me the wrong sides. The burgers comes with fries but an be substituted with other sides for additional $0.50. I ordered the C.B.C.L.T (lettuce wrap with no buns) with grilled veggie (asparagus, green and yellow squash and green onion) and my boyfriend ordered the hoisin burger with sweet potato fries . Both burger was delicious but the hoisin burger was better. The short ribs and candied bacon is a must try! \\n\\nThe second time we came it was right after the park closed and there was a 20-30 mins wait for 2. This time our waitress was not as attentive and the wait for the food was much longer. We ordered the jalape√±o popper show stopper (lettuce wrap no buns) with edamame and the dynamic duo with sweet potato fries. The jalape√±o burger was not spicy at all. I even added siracha and I still did not get the kick. The burger was still good tho but I didn't like the cream cheese as much. The short rib in the dynamic duo was pretty good. But the best burger we had so far is the hoisin burger. \\n\\nPortion size and price are decent for the park and the food is pretty good. They also have sushi rolls here that looked pretty good."},{"name":"Stefano's Grill","address":"7512 Dr Philips Blvd, Ste 80","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"A restaurant with great promise. The food was exceptional in all regards. The Delmonico steaks were tremendous with one of the two a bit under temperature and the other slightly over seasoned. Both were within acceptability. The issues we have are front end operations. As a new restaurant, I had certain expectations from the signage. I was anticipating more steakhouse than Italian Tuscan grill. The steak selections were very limited (2 filets, the delmonicos, and pork chops). The advertisement also highlighted Chateaubriand which wasn't offered but was what got us to go. The front end was more argumentative than accepting of the issue. As a result we were asked around 17 different times how things tasted. There was so much over checking that it disrupted our conversations. My suggestion is that servers articulate the vision of the owners as this is a new place. Trust the food will be great and don't be so informal. We had a ticket for 2 that was $115.

I think my expectations were just too this thing.  It also didn't help that I had some truly incredible Mac n Cheese the night before.  Don't get be wrong, this dish is still an 8 out of 10.  \\n\\nThe only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that I didn't quite enjoy the bakery as much as I would have hoped.

She blamed her statement on the so called chef and further said \\"you wouldn't send tea back in a real restaurant\\". The whole interaction was mind boggling.  Even if the guest was wrong, you should just give them a replacement. The one thing I agree with the server is that this is not a real restaurant due to the unprofessionalism  by employees. Food menu looked like a nightmare from 90s coffee shops with chipotle aioli to boot. Further more they were offering discounts to people who reviewed their shop on yelp which is in bad taste. They won't have to worry about me coming back for my discount though.

It came with a choice of rice and beans or fries.  I went with the rice and beans and was glad I did. I'm not sure what was on them maybe cilantro and mango, but it had a great flavor to it.  I think the total was about $14 dollars for the entree. \\n\\nOverall it was a good meal and I'll come back.

The sushi menu has stayed somewhat the same with some stuff added to it, pricing has increased for the same items. I've tried a lot of items from the new menu ranging from sushi to the clay pots and everything tasted phenomenal. One thing i'm really impressed with is the style of presentation which the food is brought out on. Elegant plating really made the food that much more enjoyable. Wait staff was always top notch with keeping waters filled and being attentive to all our needs. I can only remember one of our waitresses names which was Elaine. \\n\\nThis is the type of establishment which you can bring a date out to or even just grab a drink at the bar while eating some sushi. They did offer us a free complementary sushi appetizer for new patrons. Overall a very good restaurant with a ton to offer. Quincy has been up and coming and show no signs of stopping.

The menu looked like they served typical bar food in addition to having some pasta dishes and an assortment of different types of burgers. \\n\\nTheir homemade burger of the day was too good of a value to pass up so I ended up getting that. It was a ground chicken burger with chipotle aioli. The burger was really good and the ground chicken was very juicy. I loved the dinner roll-type French roll bun that sandwiched the chicken. My favorite component of the meal was the salad dressing. It tasted like it was a honey-mustard and I dipped everything in it from the salad to the fries to even the end of my burger. I washed it all down with a special sarsaparilla type soda, which was grossly overpriced. Christopher's seems like a great local restaurant bar to hit up with a large selection of beers and a great atmosphere for both dinner and also catching the big game.\\n\\nEdit: I'm taking away two stars because I got food poisoning from the chicken and realized it was the burger when Kevin T. also got sick the next day.

Please, take a look at my profile for reference.\\n\\nWalked into this Pollo Tropical tonight (well, technically, last night) at approximately 10:50pm with my lady. We've been to this location before, & while we've never experienced extraordinary service, no prior visit has been as horrendous as this.\\n\\nAs we approached the counter, we weren't greeted for at least 30 seconds, though there were AT LEAST 5 workers behind the counter. Finally, one of those workers in the back behind the grill acknowledged us & alerted the others that we were there - one of whom appeared to be a manager, who said \\"hello,\\" but seemed more interested in completing his inventory list, or perhaps his closing checklist.\\n\\nA young lady, who obviously would've rather not have been inconvenienced by our presence, approach the computer & asked us if we were ready to order. My lady needed another minute to decide, so I let her know & apologized for not being ready. No counter of \\"please, take your time,\\" or even a simple \\"no worries\\" was offered. After a few moments she came back to take our order. \\"To-go?\\" She suggested. As if dining in wasn't an option. We knew the restaurant was open until midnight, so we chose to dine-in, although that, apparently, wasn't an option according to the option we were given (or should I say, \\"according to the options we WEREN'T given\\") by the cashier. ..Eventually, when we got our food, it was already in to-go containers, (as shown in the photo below) as if to say, \\"we know you said, 'for here,' but we'd rather you go.\\"\\n\\nThen, after finally getting our food & sitting BACK down (because we'd been sitting there for about 5 minutes before our food came up), an older lady who had just begun mopping the floors, hissed at us! (I only say \\"hissed\\" because I don't know how else to describe the sound she made to gain our attention.) Apparently, she didn't speak any English, but had communicated through hand gestures that she wanted us move from where we were sitting, at a table in the middle of the dining area to a booth by the door so she could finish mopping. Although a bit irritated, we politely adhered because we knew she was just trying to finish her work in order to go home at a decent time.\\n\\nWhen we finally decided to leave at 12:02am, a friendly staff member held the door for us & told us to \\"have a great night.\\" Honestly, I wish I would've gotten those two gentlemens' names: the one who held the door for us - he had dreadlocks & a 5 o'clock shadow - & the cook who greeted us & pointed out to both the cashier & the manager that we were there - he had short hair & a low-cut beard, (he should be managing the place, if you ask me). Those two points were about the only pleasant parts of our visit. That, & of course, the food was good!

He responded affirmatively and asked how I wanted my voucher for a free appetizer. So, he promptly emailed to me while I was still on the phone with him. We chatted for a few moments longer and he said to be sure I asked for him. \\n\\nOur server Christina came to take our drink order. She was very pleasant and knew her menu. I did what was asked. I showed her our voucher and retired I.D. and asked for Tim, who unfortunately was not there yet. But another manager came by and brought an additional gift card for a free desert up to $8.99 OR a free appetizer up to $9.99\\n\\nThis location is spotless, the food was excellent, well portioned and reasonably priced.

Yes, I agree, Victoria is frugal...with HER money.  You start with an idea or a budget and then every idea you have after that is $5000 extra.  I now have a $40,000 kitchen that I can't stand.  We have zero bells and whistles.  No sliding shelves or drawer accents.  It started out as $20k but after you spends months and months working with someone you just move forward.  I feel so dumb.\\n\\nI could end it right here when I caught her installer utilizing a SHARPIE marker to cover up his mistakes, scratches and dents in my cupboards.  Victoria claimed this is \\"industry standard\\".  Industry standard to cover up scratches with a Sharpie marker?  Cherry wood cabinets?  And not even admit to it until I caught the guy redhanded?\\n\\nAdditionally, her and Scott are as sneaky as they come.  Example?  (if the Sharpie incident wasn't enough) There are many.  I took out a full 3' of counter?  I didn't check the drawing and quote after each change we made.   I tried to save money by cutting my island down 2 feet.  Well she cut my island down for sure, only she only cut the countertop and not the cupboards, saving me about $200 instead for $3000.00.\\n\\nShe helped me put in an island that is 48\\" wide. Who needs that? I can't even pass anything across the island to my kids who are sitting on the wrong side.\\n\\nAgain, if you are doing business with this woman, do not forget that she is running a business.  You will think you are pals.  You will think she CARES about your project.  You will do something to save money. She will tell you she is just too busy to get you the revised price that week but it will all work out in the end.  And then...It doesn't. And you are don't find out until the end unfortunately.  \\n\\nThe worst part is the that Victoria makes you feel guilty about anything you ask.  A sample wood?  \\"Oh that will take 3 weeks to get a sample and that will put our project behinds schedule and I will be forced to put another project in front of yours\\"\\n\\nVictoria knows how to apply pressure but then when she is over-pressured in the middle of a project she has no trouble flying off to mexico to relax and leave your project to sit. \\n\\nIf all of this wasn't enough, she refuses credit and debit cards and when you don't have time to drive to Tigard to hand the woman a check for $400.00...she will hold all of the handle install until you do.

My friends and I decided to get the popular menu items: chicken and waffles, pecan-candied bacon, and shrimp & grits.\\n\\n-Waffles & Bacon -- Comes with 3 fried chicken pieces, easily making this dish enough for 2 people. The chicken is crispy, pretty moist and peppery, which I love. The waffle is not your ordinary waffle. It is made from a carrot-cake like batter which might not sound good, but it is -- trust me. The flavor is slightly sweet but mild, and adds a fun twist to the dish.\\n\\n-Shrimp & Grits - I thought this dish is OK. The grits could be creamier and the dish could use more cajun flavor.\\n\\n-Pecan-candied Bacon - At first bite, you'll fall in love. However, after subsequent bites, the bacon becomes too rich and creamy, making it almost too much. It is another dish that is made to sample and share.\\n\\nThe ambiance is quaint and charming.

It's equipped with a really cool fire pit and sits right along Gahanna's creekside plaza, so you have the creek on one side and the cool fountain on your other. If I lived closer to the area, this would be my top pick to chill outside with a cold beer.\\n\\nI'd never been to the spot before Barrel and Boar moved in, so I can't comment on how they transformed it, but I really like the interior. It's very open, and there's two separate bars. It's fairly large space, so hopefully they can get a lot of business. It also looks like they revamped the menu from what I remember before. Our service was great as well, especially given that they had just opened.\\n\\nThey were offering $1 ribs, and I believe there was a wing special on Sundays or Mondays as well, but I'll have to confirm that one. The wings are smoked, so that already puts them a step above 90% of wing places in town, and they truly were very good! I wanted some kick though and the buffalo was pretty weak, so I would recommend going with the hot if you like spicy.\\n\\nI went with the burnt end sandwich as well as a handful of ribs. The sandwich was delicious, and I really loved the sweet BBQ sauce that came with it. I went with the cornbread for a side which is absolutely massive. It was so good, but you could easily split it into two and share. The ribs were tasty as well, and I really loved the sauces on the table, but to me, they were a bit thin with not a whole lot of meat on them. Because of that, they were a bit on the dry side, but I would definitely try them again to see if it was a one off.\\n\\nAs far as everything else goes, there's a great beer selection and a beautiful view, and the patio makes you feel like you're outback on your own patio hanging with friends. There's a lot of good looking food on the menu that I'd really love to try, and I'm definitely making it a point to get back there before the end of the Summer or Fall to enjoy that patio again.\\n\\nP.S.

She said, well let me go check if we have enough buns left. While she was checking I went to the bathroom. Upon returning the waitress said they could run to the Safeway a few doors away and get buns. I said ok, we put in our orders. When the waitress left my kids whispered to me that when I was gone, one of the waitress had been saying very, very loudly, in a very nasty, rude and aggressive tone so everyone could hear: Burgers? What, they want burgers? People want burgers. I know when I'm in a restaurant and they run out of something, I don't expect them to run out and get it.

I have been to very few restaurants that offer the same ambiance that RA offers. I came on a chilly Sunday night and I chose to sit outside (bonus points for having both indoor and outdoor patio seating). I was shocked at the view that I had. A beautiful fire right in front of me, and the wonderful austin skyline behind me with the moon shining overhead. Additionally, the overhead heaters provided at each table and the upbeat music playing in the background created a cozy but exciting environment that was perfect for conversing with others. Lastly, I can't help but comment on the artistic aesthetics of the restaurant. The modernly designed menus with the nice furniture and the splash of red on the decor was beautiful.\\n\\nNow the staff. My friend and I were greeted with genuine compassion. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. There's really not much to say about him. He truly was the type of waiter that everyone wants when they go to a restaurant, someone who is friendly but respects your privacy.\\n\\nLastly, the food. First of all, I went on a late Sunday night (around 10) and was surprised at my good fortune. I did not expect it to be happy hour so late. This is great news for anyone who wants to have some fun before the week begins. Anyways, I ordered a sashimi bowl with rice and a plate of spicy salmon rolls. My friend ordered a crunchy calamari roll and a tootsy maki roll. My sashimi was excellent, the fish was fresh, the rice was a perfect texture, and the touch of avocado and cucumber thrown in added a refreshing element to the entree. My spicy salmon roll was mediocre, it wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad. Both of the rolls my friend ordered were savory and delicious. The crunchy calamari roll was especially tasty. I was surprised that their happy hour offered so many specialty rolls considering many sushi bars only offer discounts on the basic stuff.\\n\\nThis restaurant exceeded my expectations. I expected to come and eat some good sushi, but instead, I not only enjoyed my sushi but I also had a great time eating it. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially during happy hours.

We were in Austin on a Thursday during a slow week in early December. Arrived at Franklin's at 9:15, and there were 32 people in line ahead of us. We grabbed 2 camp chairs from under the stairway; there were about a dozen more chairs, and it seems like they brought out more when those were taken. At 10:00, someone from the restaurant came by with a clipboard and asked how much meat we were planning to get; I think it was a rough tally so they could estimate when they would run out of any meat and advise those farther back in the line. We were told that we could go into the restaurant at any time to use the bathroom, or buy drinks or merchandise. At 10:45, someone told us to put away the camp chairs and anything else we didn't want to bring into the restaurant. At 11:00, the people at the front of the line were let into the restaurant and serving began. Once we got to the restaurant door at 11:15, we waited another 30 minutes to get our food, which we got around 11:45.\\n\\nOrdering. When we got to the front of the line, we were asked what type of meats we wanted and how much. We wanted a pound of brisket for the two of us, and requested all fatty meat. The slicer told us (suggested?) that, if we're getting a pound, we should also \\"try\\" the leaner meat and some of the burnt ends, and then proceeded to put together a pound of brisket with fatty, lean and burnt ends brisket. We also got 2 pork ribs (which were charged as 1/4 pound each, but never weighed), and 1 original (salt and black pepper) sausage. For sides, we got a small cole slaw and a small potato salad. They asked if we wanted some bread, and when we said yes, they gave us 4 slices of white bread. The total bill for all this food was $45.00. We also added some tip, and 2 t-shirts ($18 each).\\n\\nThe Food. We really enjoyed the fatty brisket, and less so the leaner parts. Not everyone likes fatty beef, but we eat a lot Chinese food and are used to it and really enjoy it. The burnt  ends were too seasoned for our tastes and pretty lean, and we only ate a little. There were 3 unlabeled bottles of barbecue sauce on the table. We tried all 3 - one was vinegary, one was a little spicy, and the third (the darkest in color) was a traditional (?) barbecue sauce which we used the most. The sausage was pretty good, but a little dry for me, although my wife really liked it. The pork ribs were moist and tender and pretty-much fell off the bone, but also a little over-seasoned for our tastes. The potato salad and cole slaw were simple and fine. I can't remember the last time I had sliced white bread. Beer and soft drinks are available, but we just had water.\\n\\nMy Take. Was the 2-hour, forty-five minute wait worth it? Sure! At worst, the food was very good. Was it the best barbecue I've ever had? Not sure; probably not. But the trip to Franklin's was more of an event, than a competition. It's like saying that Knott's Berry Farm is \\"better\\" than Disneyland, because the rides are better and the lines are shorter. Disneyland is still Disneyland, and Franklin's is still Franklin's. If you're a foodie, you definitely have to do it if you're in Austin. Is it worth going to Austin JUST to go to Franklin's? That's a personal decision, of course, but for me it was worth planning a trip to Austin AROUND Franklin's, but probably not worth the cost and trouble to JUST go to Franklin's.\\n\\nTips. A pound of brisket was too much for my wife and me, but we're not big eaters (any more), and as I mentioned, the leaner and burnt parts of the brisket were not great. Getting a half-pound of ONLY fatty brisket would have been better for us. Franklin's offers a full, wrapped, cold brisket to take home and reheat; if you want that, you don't need to wait in the line until opening - you can just go inside the restaurant around 8:30 or 9:00 to purchase it. We thought about taking a cold brisket home, but we didn't have a way to keep it cold until we got home some 10 hours later. From our experience and what I've read, Thursday is a good day to visit. We could have arrived even later than 9:15 and still have gotten our food before 1:00. But maybe we caught Austin in a particularly slow week. Probably best to be conservative and get there as early as you can; you really don't want to miss out on Franklin's because you wanted an extra half-hour of sleep. We also had a full breakfast (at 7:30), so we weren't hungry while in line, but had plenty of appetite by 11:45. I think that's better than skipping breakfast and having to bring snacks."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Shawn C. and I were blessed by the Screen Door gods.

We are sorry that you had such a \\"crappy experience\\" but we don't do a 2 for 1 or have our guests come up with there own pricing guide when they come to dine here. Nor do we appriciate a guest trying to get a member of our wait staff to give food at half price because you don't feel like paying a full 12 dollars for 2 large french toast sticks that come with Pork Belly, Roasted Apples and Bourbon Maple Syrup and also a free mimosa or coffee. However, we do have a \\"Solution\\" for you. Down the street is a Whataburger where you can mix and match the toppings on a burger or chicken sandwich. Not only that you can also get it at that 12 dollar price tag you're looking for.

They were perhaps the most tender pieces of meat I've ever had, in the most pleasant way possible. The beef rib just ran out when we got to the counter but if I ever have a chance to come back, I would look forward to trying that.\\n\\nPros - the tenderness of the brisket and the spareribs were ridiculous. I've never seen meat easily being cut with a plastic fork. It was tender but not mushy - the structural integrity was there but just super juicy and ready to disintegrate when you chew into it. The smoky flavor was amazing as well and the rendered fat in the brisket was really the highlight of the meal. It was perfect to eat as is, but the tangy bbq sauces on the table helped in between bites to keep things vibrant and interesting.\\n\\nCons - we were lucky to have only waited 1.5 hours. Even after waiting that long, we weren't able to get the beef rib, which was our priority item. It would be tough for me to come back for a second try if I ever visit again.

Even there it was hard to hear each other over 100 decibels of dishes clanking together and people yelling at each other just to have a conversation.

The restaurant also sat us in two separate booths which was not ideal since we were a large party together. The server was very friendly just not the most proactive. \\n\\nAll of the food tasted very bland - not even the chips were good. The salsa tasted almost like nothing. The house margarita was WAY too sweet - I couldn't even drink it and it tasted like it had no alcohol in it. Another guest had to send back her skinny margarita two times because it was too tart.

We tried the brisket, turkey, and pork ribs.  But, it's not all that much better than what you can get at Black's BBQ, County Line, or a number of other places in and around Austin.  The sauces were just average, with a vinegar base.  None of them were labeled so we didn't even really know what we were trying.  Some of the sauces on the tables had weird colors as if the staff had gotten them mixed up when refilling them, so they ended up being a mix of 2 or even all 3 of their sauces.  It was very confusing.\\n\\nWe had to wait in line for nearly 2 hours on a Thursday afternoon.  They only had one guy cutting the meats and one guy working the register.  We had to stand around with our food for another 10 minutes waiting for a table to open up.  What really ticked me off was that they actually had the nerve to ask for a tip on my credit card receipt and that they had a tip jar out on the counter.  We have to stand in line for 2 hours, get our own food, get our own drinks, and then go fight for a table and y'all want a tip?  What the hell for??  When did tipping stop being about customer service and instead just a reason for these restaurants to avoid having to pay their employees a decent salary?  And it isn't like the food here is cheap.  For the two of us it was nearly $70 (and we only had water and shared one dessert).\\n\\nThis whole place is just a one big gimmick.

Is it a classic case of a place being over-hyped, or hipsters being pretentious children happy to do stupid things? The answer is no, the hype is more than real and if you want to have the best Texas BBQ on the planet, grab a chair and get ready to wait for ~5 hours! And for those complaining abou the wait, it really is a part of the whole experience. After all, life is about the journey, not the end right?\\n\\nI've only been here 3 times, but I've been fortunate that each time I've gotten food.

If you plan things out, a weekday may be better to go on as the line isn't quite as long (that was Obama's plan) but Saturday is the only day you can get the dino ribs (aka beef ribs) and if you've never had one before I highly recommend trying one here! The star of the show is of course the brisket. Don't waste your time with the lean brisket, get the fatty moist brisket all day! It's so juicy, tender, and flavorful, easily the best brisket I've ever had in my life, and easily one of the best beef dishes I've ever had in my life. The pork ribs are amazing too, just as well seasoned, meat so tender it falls off the bone, and a burst of flavor in every bite. I will say this, you can skip on the sausage...it isn't great. The sides are only so-so as well...but let's be honest....you didn't come here to wait in line for some potatoes and slaw, you came for the meat! \\n\\nAre there relatable places that require a much shorter wait, and are probably a little cheaper? Sure, I could go to Iron Works or Rudy's and get full and have a decent meal no problem.

I was greeted warmly and then gave her my last name to look up. She said I didn't appear in the system. I showed her the confirmation I received from OpenTable and after taking a look, she said it wouldn't be a problem and that we would get seated as soon as my friend arrived. Sure enough, as soon as my friend arrived, we were seated immediately. Not sure if this was a glitch on OpenTable or Sonsie's system, but the staff handled it very well and were very gracious.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, we probably had to wait another 10 minutes or so before our server came to introduce themselves and fill our waters.

The person taking our order assured us it was vegan even though it says vegetarian and the email I received also said it was 100% vegan. Then I messaged them on Instagram to ask about the oils used since it is absolutely vegan and I couldn't understand why my husband had a reaction and I thought maybe it's an oil of some sort. They told me the oils and then I wanted to clarify the dairy thing again. I asked if the brown butter corn is actual butter (aka dairy) and they said yes. Meaning the bowl is not vegan and meaning I was lied to or someone isn't giving the correct info.

Yes, I really would know.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is intimate with very few tables, so making a reservation is highly advisable if you are planning to dine with a larger party or on a weekend night. But the smaller space, combined with the glowing red votives and the proximity to the expertly-manned wood-burning pizza oven, makes for a very comfortable, relaxed dining atmosphere that is perfect for a date or any other occasion when you would particularly appreciate not having to shout in order to carry on a conversation with your dining companions. \\n\\nNow, I consider myself a relative expert on traditional Italian and Italian-American cuisine. Let's just say I didn't spend ALL of my study abroad budget on incredibly cheap Tuscan wine and Nutella. That, and I grew up enduring terrible Godfather impressions and endlessly asinine cracks about the nature of my family's business. In true Italian style, the pizzas themselves are much smaller than you would expect from a New York-style pie and leave nothing to be desired in the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The sauce gains major points for the distinguishable use of San Marzano tomatoes, the mozzarella is rich and elastic and sparingly used (less is more), the basil is actually fresh and - and here's the good part - the crust is significantly charred and crisp, yet still tender, chewy, and flavorful. \\n\\nAs a vegetarian and one who appreciates the simple yet delicious things in life, I usually order the Margherita and am never disappointed. For me, the Bianco comes in second, featuring arugula, mozzarella, ricotta, and pecorino romano. Mmm. I have also tried the Roasted Mushroom pizza with tomato sauce, ricotta, thyme, and capers. It was also delicious, although it had an unexpected citrus note as though the ricotta had been spiked with lemon zest despite there being no indication of this on the menu. \\n\\nBackspace gets extra credit for the inclusion of Chinotto (a bitter Italian soda) on the menu, a varied and exclusively Italian wine list with more than a few particularly delicious bottles, and the exceedingly delicious Chocolate Hazelnut Budino served in a miniature mason-type jar. \\n\\nPossibly not for you if you steadfastly insist on ice in your drink (although the staff has been known to make to the other, nearby Cirkiel restaurant, Parkside, during slower hours) or are afraid of visible carbon on your food."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This was our first time.

Great BBQ doesn't need sauce and believe me, sauce is not needed here!.  Neither are knives since the meat is SO TENDER.\\n\\nBoth times, I got in line around 9:15, but if you want to make sure they don't run out of your meat before you get to the register, you better be there an hour earlier (I believe the turkey is usually the first to run out).  When I ordered, it was 1:00 pm, and I managed to get the last of the brisket and the pork ribs.  The wait in line varies depending on when you go: weekday vs, weekend vs. the parts of the year where college students aren't in Austin.  The majority of the wait will be outdoors on pavement so if you're not willing to stand for several hours straight or sit on the concrete, be sure to come prepared with chairs.  They have water available, but wouldn't hurt to bring your own.\\n\\nOverall, Franklin's is insanely good, but it'll really test your patience and endurance. Last time I went, I brought bottled water, lawn chairs, and cold corn on the cob Despite the long wait, as long as the weather and the company is good, it'll be a great experience and it really isn't that bad.

Then release them and ask them to order food from Happy Garden and write a review.\\n\\nThe result?  All the reviews below this one.\\n\\nPeople sound genuinely surprised that a place that isn't P.F. Chang's is greasy and not complex in flavor.  Chinese-American fast food is the McDonald's of ethnic food and it's supposed to be eaten at times when you just don't care what happens to your body.  \\n\\nChinese takeout is the sentry on duty guarding the road to morbid obesity.  You may not go all the way down the road, but if you pass the sentry, you've demonstrated that you have the potential to blossom into a true lardass.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my rating.  (It doesn't, but I need to keep things moving).\\n\\nThe food I've ordered from Happy Garden is at least 3.5-star food compared to other fast food, Chinese-American joints.  Their shumai dumplings are sizable and surprisingly good.  They're sweet with a garlicky accent and a springy bite.\\n\\nThe health menu, which consists of steamed items, is fantastic if eaten right away with a splash of Tabasco and a dash of salt, but they were also surprisingly good when stir-fried the next day.  Because the meat and veggies were steamed, they retained moisture when I stir-fried them over high heat and stirred in some soy sauce for flavor.  This restaurant's beef and shrimp has never disappointed me so far.  I was also able to revive the rice fairly easily.\\n\\nThe soups are always good.  The hot and sour and sweet corn chicken are my favorites.  Both are generously laced with perfect amounts of wispy egg white plus their respective traditional ingredients.  You can tell the chef paid attention to detail.  The hot and sour could be hotter but how many times have we gone through this? \\n\\nBoston restaurants = fairy spice.  (Fairy spice = The name of the sixth Spice Girl, possibly Mr. Slave from South Park).\\n\\nMy favorite thing about Happy Garden is that they indulge silly requests like \\"please use as less oil as possible\\" and \\"nothing except noodles and meat.\\"  Foodler allows you to type in requests when ordering.\\n\\nThat's right, I prefer a dryer lo mein with only noodles and beef.  I also prefer my arteries not to look like a box of butter.  Even without these additional ingredients, there's still enough flavor to enjoy the dish.\\n\\nMy second favorite thing is that the grease Happy Garden uses doesn't taste stale but it still coats the noodles so they aren't like rubber bands and the beef isn't like the tongue of a shoe.  In fact, the meat is usually soft and pretty good and the noodles are just an iota beyond chewy.\\n\\nGranted, this food is way better while enjoying my ninth bottle of Chimay and humming \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" by the Verve at 3 a.m.  But obliterated is a given with Chinese food.  If you're ordering from Chinese takeout places sober, you have a much more serious problem than drinking.  You haven't just lost self-esteem, you have no standards left.  \\n\\nYou've stopped caring.\\n\\nAnd it's only a matter of time after you stop caring that you'll feel the stab of a harpoon in your back fat while you leave the bariatric surgeon's office.  I don't know why a whale ship would be parked outside a doctor's office but I'm trying to hammer home a point.\\n\\nMy point is that this is drunk food and it should be judged accordingly.\\n\\nCompared to other Chinese places I've ordered from in Boston, it's in my top four for freshness and flavor.

If you don't know to look for it, you could easily walk on by without noticing - perfect for the speakeasy vibes of this eclectic craft cocktail bar. \\n\\nFind the black door with the simple logo, and you've found a new paradise. Downstairs, you will be greeted by the hosts if you are coming for dinner, or you can head to the bar for open seating. The ambiance is dark and sexy, with a lighting focus on the bar to remind you why you've come. Ample seating around the bar or fancy couches and coffee tables will draw you in for a longer stay. \\n\\nThe cocktail menu offers a wide variety of craft drinks, for a wide variety of booze lovers. There is always a \\"special\\" written on the board behind the bar, which serves as an outlet for the creative minds of the bartenders to \\"trial period\\" a new favorite. Saturday nights behind the bar are made even better by Joe, one of the bartenders, who really fits the vibes of this place. Joe gladly took on the challenge of helping us try every cocktail on the menu (for science, of course), and even hooked us up when they had run out of one of the drinks by tracking down a secret stash. He made our experience here extra enjoyable, a nice treat in a city full of not-so-friendly bartenders. \\n\\nW&N also has, as I understand it, a \\"chef incubater program\\". This allows for a new chef team to come in for each quarter and showcase what they've got. Currently, they have Little Owl Kitchen, which presented us a menu of Italian Mediterranean fusion. The menu looked great, but we did not eat this time. I'm hoping to come back or track down Little Owl in the future. You can read up on which chef team is taking over on the website as well, so you can come mentally prepared for the ever-changing menu. \\n\\nWe have come here with friends, family, clients, and visiting coworkers, and it is always a hit.

I had the chicken waffles, maple praline bacon, huevos rancheros, mac & cheese and the blackberry lemonade.\\n\\nPraline bacon - good. I'm not the biggest fan of bacon but it was still pretty delicious. I think just half a strip is enough before you start hating yourself from the rich, fatty, sweetness. I would recommend for everyone to try but I wouldn't order it again. \\n\\nFried chicken & waffles - lord. The sweet potato waffles was rich but light but not overly sweet. I loved this waffle. It paired perfectly with the fried chicken. The chicken is all white meat but somehow they make it so moist and well seasoned. The breading has beautiful flecks of black pepper and it was just so crunchy and the perfect amount of breading to meat. This dish beats out Roscoe's in LA. Best chicken and waffles dish I've ever had. Must order! \\n\\nBeef brisket Huevos Rancheros - so so so good!!!! I think this was my favorite dish of the meal. There's so many different components but all of them have their own purpose and it was so well balanced. This dish had amazing texture from the rich crema to the crunchy corn tortillas, beans and brisket. It comes with two eggs and popping the yolks adds another rich element making this dish just so over the top delicious. I would definitely recommend and reorder this dish. \\n\\nMac & cheese - delicious. It's hard to mess up Mac and cheese in my opinion. This one was rich, creamy, cheesy and just perfectly seasoned as well.  I would reorder. \\n\\nBlackberry lemonade - just tasted like lemonade with no blackberry flavor. For $4 I would skip it. \\n\\nService - the table next to us ordered after us with the same waiter (Ben) but got their drinks 10 minutes before us which I thought was weird. It does take a while for food to come out so I would definitely keep that in mind. Our plates took about 35 minutes to come out. I ordered the 3 piece fried chicken waffles but the server made a mistake and brought out just 2 pieces. Kind of a bummer after waiting 35 minutes for the food to come out wrong. \\n\\nAll in all the place was great. Every dish met and exceeded my expectations and I can definitely see why this place is a favorite. I would give 5 stars for the food but take away a star for the service.

Let me start by saying that the BBQ is probably one of the best I've ever had. With that said, I'm not sure I will go back. Mainly because the wait and line is also the longest I've ever seen. But that's to eat in, if you are getting to-go and pre-order like 5 pounds of meat, you can supposedly go right up to the window and get it. So that may be the way to go if I can get a bunch of people on board next time.\\nIt turns out this place is a more modern newer place with kind of a celebrity chef sort of background, which is unlike the places I usually strive for that are usually most of the time old and cooked by old extremely seasoned chefs doing it for years at a family business that has been around for a long time. But I must say, this place broke that mold for me and really is that good and at least waiting on that line at least once in my life.\\nAnd now about that line. This is a day-long event if you commit to it. The place only opens at 11am and closes at 3pm when they run out of meat, but people start standing in line at 6am! And there is only a certain amount of people on the line halfway down guaranteed food, then the rest chance it! But this is less of a line and more of a party, people bring chairs and have buckets of beers and pretty much party the whole day in line. I've heard stories of people waiting 6 hours, and it's supposedly a minimum of 3 hours which is what it was for me - and that's like an hour and a half more than I ever waited before and would wait. But I just happened to have the time and nothing to do that day, which is rare. I got there at 11:30, just 30 minutes after it opened, and the line was wrapped around the building and halfway across the parking lot and I was 5 people behind the \\"last man standing\\" who is guaranteed food. But I made it in by 2:30 and luckily there was still food for me that day.\\nNow the other thing is that whenever I do BBQ I almost always get ribs. This place is known for their brisket, the fatty brisket. I usually avoid brisket unless it's Jewish Kosher style, because many BBQ places I've had it make it too dry or flavorless requiring it to be doused or soaked in BBQ sauce. So I decided to get a couple ribs, and the rest fatty brisket. And it truly was the best, and fattiest brisket I ever had! I believe the best way to judge a BBQ place is by being able to eat the meat without having to touch any BBQ sauce, and this place succeeded. So be your own judge, I dare you with that line, and I think if you do it at least once in your life, you wont regret it.

Haven't been to this location since it was Carlos N Charlie's.  When we arrived we were the only customers. Found we had to order food at a window and then drinks from the bar.  Was told to grab a seat.  Prices were pretty much similar to McArthur's but with zero happy hour.  \\n\\nOrdered food, received a buzzer and then went to the bar to order drinks.  Asked if they had beer on tap and the answer was no.  The bartender needs some training within the service industry.  I asked what beers were available and he points to a row of beers on the other side of the bar up on a hanging board and he said, the beer selections are up there and pointed.  I had to walk around to the other side of the bar to see what they had.  \\n\\nGot the beers and walked to a table. No water offered, zero service and prices of a decent restaurant with zero service.\\n\\nOrdered grilled cheese sticks & chips n queso with guacamole.   The chips  were crisp, the guacamole was flavorless, the queso had a texture of being reheated from a previous day and did not taste good,  the cheese sticks were over done and did not taste good.

The positives are that the pizza and caprese salad are very tasty and reasonably priced (and that's what's kept me coming back). However, I'm only giving it 2 stars because of my disappointing experience with the service last time.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I visited a couple Saturdays ago, and it took us 50 minutes to get our simple large margherita pizza. It was a very busy night (there was a large group), but what was extremely frustrating was that many parties who ordered after us got their pizzas 15+ minutes before us. I am willing to be patient when it's busy, but I felt very disrespected that we kept being passed over and that no one bothered to check up on us. Everyone around us started looking sympathetically at us, and even suggested we complain, because it was so obvious that we were being overlooked. I had to ask for our pizza 3 times before anyone bothered to send us an appetizer. Probably because I was very polite the first 2 times and only decided to be visibly frustrated the last time. \\n\\nBecause I like the pizza, I really want DeSano to work on their operations to improve the experience for others.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My trip to Atlanta had to start off by trying some BBQ. I had several places bookmarked. I chose Fox Bros because my friend liked what he saw from the pictures. It was raining when we got there which was a bummer because they have a decent size outside dining area which was of no use. So the wait for a table was going to be even longer because inside dining was the only option. We decided to place a to-go order. We got Texas Fries, The Everything Plate, and for dessert, the banana pudding. \\n\\nWe waited outside on the benches under a canopy thing. In the middle of waiting I tell my friend I need to go and tell the order taker to put various sauces on the side. He tells me just ask for it when they bring the order out. Big mistake ugh lol.\\n\\nSo after waiting, our to-go order is brought to us. I ask the employee is their sauces on the side for our food. He says, yes. I'm thinking ok great. After he repeats our order, I ask him one last time and he says their ARE sauces in the bag. It was raining and cold and I just wanted to get in the car so I didn't bother to double check the bag. We get back to the hotel and of course to my luck there is no sauces on the side. Anyone who knows me knows I love condiments, salsas, dips, sauces; all that stuff it enhances the food greatly to me. Imagine how pissed I was. \\n\\nThe Texas Fries were probably the best part of the meal. OMG these were so good. The fries were big enough to share. We got it with brisket meat. At times the cheese made it difficult to eat with a fork but I didn't care I scarfed those fries down. \\n\\nWhere I needed my sauces was for the meat in the Everything plate. We got ribs, chicken, and brisket. Sides were Jalapeno cornbread and collard greens The ribs were a little dry and did not taste good enough to be eaten plain. It also wasn't smoky enough for me. I was upset because I love ribs and I was looking forward to this the most. The cornbread was good and I'm glad they remembered to add a side of butter cause it made it better The brisket was ok, but it tasted better when it was in the Texas fries. I didn't eat the chicken.\\n\\nThe Banana pudding was a highlight. So rich& creamy and tasted homemade. The cinnamon whipped cream I had on the side made a nice addition to this dessert. Overall,my meal was average with a couple of highlights. I don't know when the next time I will be in at Atlanta, but whenever that is I may give Fox Bros another shot and update my review accordingly."},{"name":"The Greenery Creamery","address":"420 E Church St, Unit 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Gotta love the ice cream here.

The okra was delicious and even if you didn't like okra you would eat this one BUT the star was the pork belly appetizer.  uhm.... I was speechless because I wanted to eat every single bite of this thing - it was accompanied by a slaw made of apples and cranberries which made it over the top and beyond perfect. \\n\\nFor entree we shared the fried chicken and the mac n cheese.  I am speechless.  The chicken is cooked to perfection.  The batter was crisp and perfect and the chicken was tender and juicy inside.  The collard greens were on point, the mashed potatoes were buttery and melts in your mouth and the mac n cheese... don't even get me started with it.  First of, I don't really crave or like mac n cheese all that much BUT this mac n cheese - I crave, even as we speak.  It is baked so the cheese on top is a bt crunchy and burnt in a wonderful way and the inside is a cheesy goodness.  The pasta is cooked not al dente but not soggy soft.  Just perfect for mac n cheese.  \\n\\nWe loved this place so much we were tempted to come back the next day to eat brunch but we really wanted to try different places so we opted not to.

From what I've read here and from what I've heard from my friends about Franklin's BBQ, I expected it to be a damn near sexual experience when I finally rolled up to the front of the line 3 hours later (on a Wednesday, mind you). Just to be clear, it wasn't, but that don't mean it wasn't damn good either. \\n\\nThe moneymaker in Texas is brisket, so we'll start there. Franklin's brisket is damnnnnnn good. It pretty much falls apart in your mouth, and when you combine it with their coffee-based BBQ sauce (my personal favorite) and balance it out with a sliced pickle, they've really got something going. You've got to get the moist brisket though -- don't try to be all healthy and go for lean brisket because you will definitely regret it. The fatty brisket though. My God, the fatty brisket though... Write home about that, y'all.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was really good as well. It's of a much richer and fattier variety when compared against the brisket. As a guy who's had a lot of BBQ in the south (Arkansas, Tennessee), pulled pork is our staple. It's definitely good, but in my opinion, it was a bit too fatty for my tastes. It's great to throw on the bread and have for a sandwich though. Don't skimp on the pickles either.\\n\\nI think the pork ribs are a bit of an understated selection at Franklin's. I heard a lot about their brisket before I went in, but those ribs are excellently done and not to be outshone.The meat falls right off the bone and is incredibly flavorful. Pair it with any of their sauces and you're golden right there.\\n\\nI don't recommend wasting stomach real estate on the sausage. It's a solid selection, but it's not mind blowing. Just a well made frank.\\n\\nAll in all, Franklin's knows how to get it done when it comes to BBQ. All else equal, their BBQ is one of the best I've ever had. However, you definitely need to take into the account that you're going to be waiting around for 3 hours before you can even order. I know a lot of people take chairs out, read, drink beer, and in general shoot the wind while they're in line, but you need to be leaps and bounds above the competition to make me wait 3 hours in line. At the end of the day, Franklin's isn't 3 hours of wait better than other joints like Saltlick's and J.Mueller's. It's definitely an experience you should try out if you're in Austin. But unless you're a BBQ puritan, you probably won't be able to tell the difference anyway.\\n\\nP.S. Get the fatty brisket."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I get it, this place is only a month old, but it's an experienced restaurateur and they still don't have the fundamentals right. Arrived here for our 8:30 reservation at 8:28 and are promptly told our table will not be ready for another 15 minutes. WTF is the point of having a reservation even??? Fine, we go hang out by the bar and order a couple of hurricanes (this will surely soothe my annoyance). Pay for the hurricanes and the bartender tells me it'll just be a couple of minutes. 5 minutes have no elapsed (not 15) and the hostess is looking to seat us. Tell her we're still waiting on the drinks we ordered. \\n\\n5 more minutes go by and still no hurricanes. So now there's a storm brewing inside of me. Same bartender approaches me. \\"How are you doing tonight? What can I get you to drink?\\" Me: \\"I ordered two hurricanes.\\" Him: \\"Two hurricanes coming right up!\\" Me: \\"No, I ordered them 10 minutes ago and paid you for them but never received them.\\" Him (with a look of confusion): \\"Oh they come from a different bar. A service bar. They never made it to you?\\" Me (suppressing the category four storm now raging inside of me): \\"No.\\" Him: \\"Well it will just be a few more minutes. Me: \\"We have a table waiting for us.\\" Him (bewildered): \\"Well I'll find you when they come up.\\" \\n\\nWe're seated. 10 more minutes go by, no waitress and no drinks. Finally the bartender comes into the restaurant side with our drinks and shortly thereafter the waitress arrives. She explains the place two us (it's tapas) suggests we ordered a couple of things to share and takes our initial order of biscuits. The hurricanes were actually amazing. You could tell they were plenty strong, but still tasted like fruit. We get our biscuits and start eating. They were heavenly. Warm and soft and all around delicious. Especially with the butter and the pimento cheese spread. The biscuit to spread ratio, however, was all out of whack. Too many biscuits to too little spread. \\n\\nWe ordered the short rib boudin croquettes , the fried pickles, and the fried chicken sliders. Croquettes were pretty bland. I love short ribs and you couldn't taste that distinct short rib flavor at all. It was like they took corned beef hash, floured it, and deep fried it. The \\"Baconaise\\" couldn't even save it. Next the sliders arrived. The fried chicken was good, but nothing spectacular. It was decent, nothing remarkable. Next came the fried pickles. They got these right. Lightly fried, pickles still firm, and the buttermilk-cayenne-ranch dipping sauce was a nice compliment. During all of this we tried to order a couple of grenades, but were told it needed 10 more minutes to freeze properly.\\n\\nThe heads up was much appreciated. The waitress did a fantastic job and was probably the only service highlight of the night.We ordered some beignets and waited for our grenades. They arrived around the 10 minute mark as promised, but tasted terrible. Way too much midori. Beignets arrived pipping hot and they were truly excellent. The mascarpone for dipping was a perfect balance of sweet and tart. At least they ended on a high note? \\n\\nWell not so fast, dear reader. Despite closing at midnight we were one of the few remaining tables at 9:45 and the table busing staff was clearly anxious to get us out. We were picking at our beignets and sipping on our grenades and they kept hoovering to see if they could take our plates. Finally we just gave up and told them to take them. (We had already paid the bill at this point). Other than the waitress, the service was atrocious. The food was mediocre.

I don't even really know how to say that.\\n2) They had a neat little salsa bar with four different choices. Each of them had very distinct flavors and were of different hotness levels.

I had been looking forward to trying this place for months & I finally had a chance to the other day. Indeed, they do have a bunch of unique flavors & the store is really cute, but that doesn't mean they have a good product. I tried a number of both the vegan & regular flavors and all were very icy and lacked that creamy, fatty mouthfeel that I love about a premium ice cream. The flavors themselves were interesting, but also didn't last very long in your mouth. You taste them very shortly, and then it's gone-- super strange. I even saw one employee making ice cream & saw it coming out of the machine-- it didn't have a creamy, smooth consistency. It was icy and looked hard.\\n\\nOn top of this, the employee serving me seemed annoyed that I was asking for a couple of samples-- and there was no one else in the store!

I had booked a table for two for 12:00, but she said my reservation was for 5:00pm. That's wrong, because I even had my reservation email saying it was for noon. Whatever. We still got a table by the window because it wasn't packed. \\n\\nWe ordered from a prix fixe brunch menu which came with a starter parfait, first course (spinach salad for my boyfriend and shrimp and grits for me), main entree (eggs Benedict for him and I ), and dessert (flan and red velvet cupcake). \\n\\nThe parfait was awful-it seemed as if the kitchen threw things into it without trying to get the fruits and nuts to complement the yogurt. The maple syrup didn't belong. Honey would have been a better choice. \\nThen came the first course - my shrimp and grits was flavorful and good. Only complaint was that it was very small. I finished it in 2 spoonfuls. My boyfriend's spinach salad was pitiful. It looked and tasted as if it came from a bag, and they tossed in a flavorless dressing and 2 other toppings. \\nWe were not impressed, but we were here for the view and thought perhaps the entrees would make up for the very disappointing parfaits and first courses. Nope. We waited 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive. In that time, the kitchen staff brought us our desserts TWICE - to which we had to send back TWICE because we haven't even had our main courses yet! I felt bad for our server because he was very apologetic. I don't know whether the kitchen was short staff due to the holiday or what, but what a major fail. The restaurant was only half full as is!\\n\\nAs for the entrees, when it finally did arrive, it was only mediocre. The eggs benedict were flavorless and placed on top of a piece of toasted baguette which shouldn't have belonged there. The baguette made it difficult to eat because it would fall apart. The hardness of the bread just didn't work with a dish like eggs benedict. Who is in charge of the kitchen? He or she needs to be replaced. Simply awful for a pricey restaurant. \\n\\nAfter our entrees, we had to wait about just as long for our desserts. We were about to just throw down some bills and skip out on the dessert, but it finally came out. Glad we didn't leave, because the desserts were the ONLY good thing about our meal. The flan was delicious. The cupcake was not as good, but it was much better than our entrees. \\nOur waiter knew we were upset, which was why he didn't make eye contact with us while we were waiting for our food. He knew better than to ask how everything was. I'm glad he didn't, because I would have demanded to speak to the manager. My boyfriend and I tried to make the best of it since it was the first day of a New Year, and we didn't want to start it off on a bad note, but there was nothing that could have saved our brunch.

In terms of service, we had a 6:30pm reservation on a Saturday night, so service was subpar. Word to the wise: don't book a reservation on a Saturday night. It took 20 minutes for our server to come get our order. And what's up with not providing forks?! We got knives but no forks, so we had to flag down another server for forks (ours was running around doing God knows what). Anyway. Busy night. Try to shoot for a different day to experience it all--good food, good service, and good ambiance. Tonight just didn't cut it, but at the very least, the pork belly was divine.

I felt that I should write this more for the owners of Andina so they fix some of the problems we encountered.  We arrived thirty minutes early for our reservation, so we checked in and sat in the bar for a cocktail before dinner.  We ordered the PISCO SOUR \\"KUONG TONG\\" and the A√áA√çPIRINHA, they were excellent drinks, they were so well balanced and elegant, they are some of the best cocktails I have had in a long time.  The bartender was very attentive and checked in to see how the drinks were, very good service.  The only downside was that we were sitting close to the service bar and witnessed the bartender and a server yelling at each other and the server throwing a napkin in the bartenders face, this was all in Spanish, but you can never assume that there are not spanish speakers present to understand the conversation.  My husband speaks spanish and understood the argument, which was not appropriate to be saying in front of customers.  The hostess came to get us for dinner and carried our drink to our table for us and was great.  But when we got to the table I realized we got the worst table in the house.  The two top was really close to the bathroom, so directly behind me was the bathroom door, which was my husbands view, and then next to my head inches away, was the back of a womens head waiting for a table on the other side of the half wall.  In addition, I heard all the conversations of the people waiting for their tables because they were sitting so close to me.  Besides, the awful table and the fight we witnessed, we were still having a good time, we were excited for dinner.  The service we encountered in the dining room from our server was very disappointing, not the support staff, the server.  I have worked as a server in fine dining for years and I know all the steps of service so i am generally picky when I see people not giving a certain level of service when I spend $200 on my dinner.  But the service we had was like eating at a busy breakfast place, where someone just comes up and asks what you want to eat and does the bare minimum.  We ordered the oysters, which were of course amazing because they were the tillamook oysters which I absolutely love, the jamon  serrano, the scallop app, octopus, and the tuna nikei.  The apps were great, except for the tuna.  I just felt so bad for that beautiful yellowfin ahi tuna that was bathed in lime and onion.  The only thing I tasted with each bite was lime juice and onion with a hint of ahi.  My husband is a chef and I know what the point of this dish was but it was not executed well.  It also bugged me that when we asked how the ahi was prepared, if it was marinated in the lime juice like normal ceviche and he said it was made to order, so I figured that the tuna should barely be \\"cooked\\" by the lime if it is made to order, but it was way more cooked than being made to order and I don't believe that it hadn't been marinated for a while.  We finished our apps and were waiting for the server to come over and when he did he poured water and I had to ask if we could order our entrees (I think he forgot we never ordered them), being that he knew we were interested in the lamb and I am sure it takes time for that to cook. so I wanted to get it started so we weren't there forever.  I don't know if he was slammed yesterday or not, but he was very disinterested in our table and did not seem like he wanted to be there.  Our entrees came and I got the tuna, it was AMAZING.  It was cooked perfectly MR and everything on the plate just complemented each other, I was very happy.  My husband on the other hand was between the lamb shank and the rack and when asked the server recommended the shank, we have heard great things about both from friends too.  He got the shank and by this point with such crappy ambiance, service, and the disappointing ahi app, my husband was expecting the evening to be redeemed by the entree.  He thought the lamb was good but nothing amazing like he had heard and expected.  He said the lamb was overpowered by the sauce and he has had much better shank.  All in all, we were mostly disappointed in the service, it had the most impact on our night.  The drinks were amazing (bartender was great) and my ahi entree was amazing.  The rest  of the food was definitely good,  I have heard consistent rave reviews about Andina for years from my friends and I was excited to go somewhere with consistency, because I wanted a guaranteed good experience overall and it wasn't consistent for us. If you make a reservation here, to be on the safe side, request NOT to sit near the bathroom."},{"name":"New India Buffet","address":"901 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"yummmy!

It is very rare that when I travel for business that I visit the same restaurant twice during that trip but my first time there was so great that I left with a big wow to the point I came back two days later.\\n\\nOn my first visit, I made a reservation through Open Table (love getting those points) for a 5:30 pm reservation and parked my rental in their small parking lot next to the restaurant.Prior to arriving, I had reviewed the menu items and had decided on the buttermilk coated chicken breasts served with Mac n Cheese.\\n\\nSince I was dining alone, I was greeted by a cheerful Host who I later learned on my second visit that he was very good friends with \\"Poor Calvin\\" who I learned from my server bartender that the name of the restaurant came from the owner/Chef who was always working so many hours that the staff would always say \\"Poor Calvin.\\" - Hence the uniqueness of this place.\\n\\nI ended up asking if I could sit at their small bar which after perusing the dining area decided that I would be most comfortable there.  Jen the bartender who recently started working there definitely fit the quirkiness and uniqueness of this theme and after exchanging pleasantries guided me on the libations that were offered as well as the dinner items and specials.\\n\\nMy mind was already set as there were so many positive reviews on Calvin's signature dish of chicken with mac n cheese and I definitely was not disappointed. The two pieces of chicken were pre-coated in buttermilk accompanied with his mac n cheese, haricot vert, broccolini, and oven roasted kale as a garnish along with  a couple of housemade potato chips. \\"Heaven\\" can best describe this dish along with the lychee martini that I paired with this libation. \\n\\nNow for the desserts. Prior to dining, I saw the small dessert case next to the kitchen and was amazed at the size (think Cheescake Factory or Claim Jumper) and you get that visual idea. When I asked about the desserts, I was even more shocked that for this tiny restaurant, they were not store bought and were not made by a Pastry Chef at the restaurant but by Poor Calvin himself. Now, I don't know many restaurants of that size  where the chef makes both the entrees and desserts.\\n\\nIn closing, I went back two days later and ordered the same entr√©e (yes it was that good) and just as consistent as my earlier visit.\\n\\nAs an added bonus, it was raining heavily on my second visit and read on social media th if you are staying in the downtown area, they will take care of your transportation through Uber.

It took quite some time to have someone take our order. And when my husband asked for mustard, they forgot and so we had to remind them again. For whatever reason, service was just slow that night.\\n\\nAs for the food, my husband ordered a burger and I ordered the tuna tartare and a bowl of clam chowder.

There. I said it.  \\n\\nI love indian food and have literally eaten it all over the world (except India, bummer).  I had heard that this place was decent for Bangladeshi food, so on a night when my friend and I were craving spicy food, we decided to give it a shot.  \\n\\nWe rolled in around 6:30 on Friday and were immediately seated.   There were 3 other groups in the dining room that was relatively small with really cheap chairs and mirrors hanging on the wall.  If the food is good, I don't have to pay for nice decor, but I point this out because of the following: shortly after sitting down the waiter/host who sat us placed the napkins in out laps.  It was just a little bizarre for a place that I would *maybe* describe as a step above a hole in the wall.  The waiter also asked us if we had ever been there before.  We responded \\"no\\" and got a scripted speech from our waiter about when they are open including hours, how they really want you to make a reservation on the weekends, and how they don't have a liquor license.  It was like they were selling a brand, but I already had decided that I wanted to try their brand out.  Like I said, weird.\\n\\nWe began to peruse the menu and were given enough time to decide what we wanted to eat.\\n\\nWaiter #2 came over and immediately asked us if we had been there before.  \\nMe: \\"No\\"\\nWaiter 2: \\"How did you hear about us\\"\\nMe: \\"My Brother used to come here when he lived in Atlanta\\"\\nWaiter 2: \\"Oh really, what was his FULL name?\\"\\nMe: \\"Adam LastName\\"\\nWaiter 2: \\"Oh, I don't think I know him.  I bet I would recognize him\\"\\nMe: *awkwardly* \\"Oh?\\"\\nWaiter 2 went on to give us the same EXACT speech we had gotten before.  This time they really drove home the \\"we take and encourage reservations.\\"  They pushed it to the point that if I was obnoxious I would have asked if they would prefer us to go to the parking lot and call for a reservation for 10 minutes from now.  Oh and they told us to put their number which was listed on their menu (as our waiter pointed it out) into our cell phones so we could call in advance.  It really came off as \\"we don't want you here unless you let us know you are coming.\\" \\nHe finally got around to taking our order, but apparently not having been there before meant \\"neither of us has ever had food like this before.\\"  \\nHe recommended we try their Halim Soup.  I typically order Mulligatawny soup, so I asked if their Halim was better.  He assured me that it was better.  We both decided to have a cup.\\nHe then asked us what meats we were each eating.  I had decided on lamb and my friend was going to get something with beef.  He recommended a beef and sweet potatoes dish for my friend and then something that I would never order for me.  I declined and decided to try their Vindaloo explaining that I love spice (it came up more than once in our conversation).  He then told us to get some naan.  We decided to go for it, thinking we would be sharing a single order.  He ended up putting in an order for each of us (waaaaayyyyyy too much for two people).  He then tried to push more food on us, but by that point we were fine.\\n\\nAs we were waiting for our food we heard the waiters continue to give other patrons who missed the reservation memo the same speech we were given.  Oddly, after that over attentive start to the night, the service declined dramatically after our soups arrived.\\n\\nThe soups were wonderful.  Definitely the highlight of our meal and the only thing that we ordered that I would get again.  I would have given a much lower score if this soup hadn't been so good.\\n\\nThe Vindaloo was just okay.  The flavor was a bit dull and definitely lacking for the amount that I indicated that I love spicy food.\\n\\nMy friend's dish was a little better than mine but also just okay.\\n\\nIt took forever for the waitstaff to realize that we were finished and when they finally did it took them an exceedingly long time to run our cards. I would estimate that we sat waiting for a solid 25 minutes after we were finished and there were people waiting to be seated. \\n\\nI think if I am to return, I will be ordering takeout or coming in for the buffet.

I must have asked for 3 extra servings of it and they happily gave it to me with no extra charge. I can't say enough good things about the service.... Our server Diana was so sweet and attentive. Always with a smile on her face and always so happy to see us when we arrive. All the servers there are from Colombia and although English is not their first language, they communicate beautifully and make every effort to explain the menu to you.

Immediately upon walking in to the restaurant we were impressed with its beauty and the large size of the space. The extremely high ceilings also give it an immense feeling but the bar area has lowered wood bearings to make it feel intimate. The front room was hosting a rehearsal dinner which I thought was a cool space. \\n\\nWe ordered one of their cocktails with our appetizers and were disappointed to hear that it was premixed. I feel that it compromised the quality of the drink, making it not worth $11. We also ordered the baked oysters and pork belly - the oysters were mediocre but the pork belly was really good. We ordered the scallops with risotto and flank steak as our entrees- the scallops were cooked perfectly but the steak was extremely under cooked. \\n\\nI would not necessarily recommend this restaurant for those that have a gluten sensitivity. We asked for a GF menu and were just given a regular menu marked up with a pen. We initially had ordered the mussels since they were marked as GF but luckily the waiter checked with the chef because they ended up having beer in them. I spoke to the manager and apparently their menu changes frequently so it's hard for them to make a proper GF menu.

This is a cool hang out spot.  I was told this had amazing pizza by couple of the locals. Got the following pizzas:\\n\\n*Bianco: Arugula, mozzarella, ricotta, pecorino romano.  Where's the arugula?!?!?  It was missing.  Sorry the taste on this pizza didn't make it unless you like a bit of tang to it.\\n*Fennel sausage - mozzarella, roasted peppers, 15 garlic - The sausage was over cooked and dry but had a good flavor.\\n*Pepperoni americano - picante salame, tomato, mozzarella, basil. - Nothing special.\\n\\nI like to eat the crust.  I know lots of people just eat the center and toss the crust to the side.  No, no, no...  I tear off a piece of the crust and check it out for the flavor and texture.  The dough didn't taste good.  I don't know what kind of flour they use but it's definitely not San Felice flour.  Are you even using Caputo flour?!?!?  If you are, you're not cooking it properly to get the full flavor of it.\\n\\nThey need to turn down the heat of the oven, rotate the pizza throughout the oven, use different flour or something.  Noticed all the pictures of the pizza.... there are big burnt bubbles and very light spots on the crust.  The dough was tooooo chewy.  Is it suppose to be like this or is the dough not fully cooked and the outside is cooked too fast.  Take a look at Tonys Pizza Napoletana in Yelp in SF.  Yes there are burnt edges, but they're tiny burnt, not big bubble of burnt.  \\n\\nI thought the price of the pizza was expensive for the quantity and quality.  Maybe there aren't too many wood fire pizza places in Austin so everyone thinks it's good.  Go try the places in the Bay Area in California and there are several of them which are waaay better.  The prices in the Bay Area maybe about 2 dollars more, but you get a medium/large vs the small/medium sized pizza.\\n\\n1 star for the atmosphere."},{"name":"Killa Wasi","address":"3913 Todd Ln, Ste 607","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was pretty good!

As the host called my name we proceeded to our waiting table. The atmosphere was very nice, relaxed with a rustic but modern feel. We had not even a minute to look at the 3 menus before the host rushed us to make a decision on what we wanted. He was so unwelcoming and had an attitude which for me didn't suit the tone of the place. We  quickly settled on the trout hash which I have to say was on of the most delicious dishes I had tasted in a while. So having waited 1 hour to be seated, we had finished what we thought would be our first round of food in under 15 minutes... Within that time, the host never offered us a top up of our coffee or anything but instead proceeded to hastily put the bill down on the table. I didn't think anything of it at first until we decided it would be a good idea to finish the brunch with some pancakes, coffee cake and a cup of coffee. When we called the host over to place our other order, he abruptly told my husband and I that he was needing the table as there were other customers waiting!?!?! I then calmly explained to him that we weren't aware that we needed to order everything at once and actually we missed alot of the menu in the first place as we were initially rushed through our order!

I hear Ghazal is closing sometime soon.  Where can the enterprising JP yuppie get Indian food that is of similar quality?\\n\\nA. Tikki Masala has you covered!  You need no longer subject yourself to the tyranny of Ghazal's horrible delivery, or Bukhara's on-again-off-again relationship with flavor in its curries.\\n\\nQ.  Delivery, you say?  Is delivery from here as much of an adventure as from every other place in JP, which will either dispatch your food via cage-free grassfed bicycle courier, or in a '89 Civic that makes twelve stops before getting to your house?\\n\\nA. First of all, I will not hear a word spoken against bike delivery of food in our fair town, even if it takes an obscene amount of time, because the dude who bikes up my giant hill is always a good sport about it, and has a glorious mustache.  But no, this is not your typical delivery schedule.  Last time we ordered, I timed it.  Total time elapsed from ordering on the internet to the doorbell ringing: 28 minutes.  I've waited that long for food IN THE DINING ROOM OF GHAZAL.\\n\\nQ. What's good here?\\n\\nA. I have yet to be disappointed, and that is after I recently ordered the weirdest-looking things on the menu to see if they were as good at preparing low-throughput dishes.  Result: yes they are.  The chicken is moist, the goat is flavorful, and the shrimp... well, I'm still trying to figure out how they got a shrimp dish to my front door that was too hot (temperature) to eat immediately, without overcooking the shrimp.  My shrimp overcook if I crank the thermostat up past 72.\\n\\nQ. I ordered $35 worth of food, and I get either a free dessert thingy or a free appetizer.  Which should I get?\\n\\nA. The badami kheer has been the only negative part of our orders here.  Get the tikki.\\n\\nQ. On a scale of one to ten, how obsessed is your household with Tikki Masala?\\n\\nA.  My wife ordered from them three times between last Monday and Thursday.  Today, I found myself scouring the internet for proof that the one-star reviews are hired goons working for Big Curry.  (I'm looking at you, VivekSagar K from Miami Beach) My two-year-old daughter can't pronounce \\"tomato\\", but can clearly articulate \\"chicken tikka masala.\\"  \\n\\nQ.

It wasn't enough to ruin the dish by any means, but considering this is the 3rd or 4th time I've seen this complaint in reviews, it's clear it needs to be addressed.\\n\\n2. The food took too long to come out IMO. I know they just have one small oven, but by the time we came in, to the time we got our pizza, it was over 45 minutes. This might not bother some people, especially if you plan on coming with a group of friends and getting some appetizers and wine, but for a typical dinner where you come in hungry, waiting 45 minutes for a pizza that takes 5 minutes to cook was a little frustrating.

The large, open cafe is decked out with French artwork, \\"Paris\\" signage, mismatched tables & chairs, non-traditional chandeliers (my favorite one is made of pots!)- but everything comes together in a charming and whimsy way.  This location is a spawn off from the original location in Charlotte, NC. Owners Jimbo and Emily bring the absolute best of both southern charm and homey cafe to the table, with an incredible staff to boot. \\n\\nOutside what I listed in my first sentence, there are a whole bunch of other reasons you need to try Amelie's. How about the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had... EVER. Or the most delicious caffeinated drink: the dirty iced chai, your standard iced chai late + shots of espresso. Mmmm tastes like Fall. Or the no-hassle free wifi. And free, closeby parking. And the friendly faces behind the counter. \\n\\nAmelie's is a dream for foodies like me. So far I've had the breakfast sandwich on a croissant, the strawberry & cream cheese croissant, and the almond twice-baked croissant. I can't wait to try all the other amazing-looking items in their display case, particularly the mini-tarts. I'm not a french bakery expert, but I've tried a bunch of other bakeries in ATL (including Doceur de France) and my opinion is that Amelie's blows them all out of the water.\\n\\nIf I were looking for a working space, here are some things I would LOVE about Amelie's: they have a great variety of seating arrangements: from couches, to 6-8 person tables, to tiny single tables. And when the semester gets back in full swing they plan on going back to being open 24hrs all the time. Delicious treats. Iced coffee gets 1 free refill, yeah! \\n\\nThe only downsides: when it's full it can get loud (bring headphones), there aren't a whole lot of outlets (bring a strip if you think you'll need it), WiFi was acceptable but not incredibly fast (don't come to watch Netflix). \\n\\nTo give you an idea, Amelie's is everything Octane is not. Well-lit, plenty of space, and oh yeah, friendly. So if you've tried Octane and you're not feeling it, try Amelie's. If Amelie's isn't a good fit- try my other favorite in the area, Urban Grind. \\n\\nI'm so glad to see another fantastic, food-and-service driven business open up near my neighborhood.

I only had one good piece of picanha during my whole dinner. All other pieces and meats were not too good. Im very disappointed. \\nThe reason I am giving one star is because I asked for the bill without even being full. I am sad that this place is failing, as I see all the potential here.

Researched a couple of Best Of lists to see what they suggested, and we found Townsman.  Looked at the menu and figured we'd give it a shot.  Luckily they were able to fit us in last minute.  It was a Monday night though, so maybe that's why.\\n\\nTownsman has a great atmosphere.  Very trendy design, colorful and new.  I think out of all the great places we'd eaten while on our trip, Townman wins the prize.  It was more casual than the others, but the food was anything but.  Everyone at our table really enjoyed the whole experience.\\n\\nStarted off with a few appetizers.  I bypassed the oysters, but the others said they were very good and super fresh.  I opted for the fried dumplings, which were stuffed with cabbage and raisins with a maple flavor.  Very flavorful bite.  We also shared the American Ham charcuterie which had two different kinds of ham along with some cheese, honey and pickles.  It's always fun to share a charcuterie with the table.  The meats on this board were very good.\\n\\nIt's very rare - almost nonexistent - to find monkfish on a menu where we are from.  My husband was ecstatic about seeing a Pan Roasted Monkfish available here.  Sitting in a green curry broth with potatoes and clams, he was in heaven and didn't hear much out of him for a good 15 minutes.\\n\\nMy entr√©e selection was the Ricotta Gnochetti.  Served with a vegetable Bolognese that was hearty and delicious.  Pasta was hand made, which gets bonus points from me.  I got so much of it though that I left zero room for dessert, and that makes me very sad.\\n\\nOne thing to say about dessert though.  My husband got this chocolate/peanut butter thing - two of his top two flavors of all time.  When he got it, it had flamb√©ed bananas on top of it with something else banana.  My husband is petrified of bananas (I say that jokingly, but it's kind of true) ... He told the server he couldn't eat it and they remade him another with zero banana without blinking an eye.  So that was nice.  However, we did suggest maybe mentioning the banana thing in the description on the menu because it wasn't listed anywhere.  It was a pretty major part of the dessert, not just a garnish.\\n\\nOverall, fantastic meal and excellent service.  Everything was awesome, right down to the butter spread on the end of a tin can (cute!).

Great trendy casual atmosphere, never had an issue with service and I'll just make a note of saying that I do enjoy their use of re-usable water bottles for service. Thank you, for doing that. The price is really what you make it. A pizza alone is somewhere between 13 and 19 I think, depending on what kind you get. A side note on that, you COULD share it with another, rational person. I always tell people when we have plans to go there \\"Don't eat anything, because you're going to eat your own pizza and trust me, you don't want to take it home.\\" I've gone all out there and it was maybe 200 for 4 people or you can go low key and spend less.

HILARIOUS.\\n\\nI like the fact that this restaurant does not charge a corking fee and it's of course, BYOB.  Our waiter was nice enough to offer to chill our wine during dinner.  This is definitely a super cute date spot but also fun for groups of 4 as their tables are preset.  Our waiter coincidentally was the owner's son so his level of customer service was superb!\\n\\nWe had the this chicken and tomato sauce dish, along with this lamb/gravy dish.  I'm not a huge fan of white rice but enjoyed the buttered jasmine rice with green peas.  My favorite is the onion naan bread that was stuffed with onions and cilantro.  It was soft and fluffy and really brought the flavor out of the main entrees.  \\n\\nThe appetizer was nothing I've ever seen before. It's this fluffy pita bread that deflates when you tap it with a fork.  Then you choose your stuffing (we had the one with spiced chicken and onions) and roll it up into a burrito type roll.  Super fun to do and since it was my first time, our waiter walked me through it.\\n\\nThe dessert was this interesting cheese custard that was firm and served in a large shot glass type dish.  Enough for two people to share after going through the appetizer, 2 entrees, the flavored naan, & rice platter.  (See attached photos.)\\n\\n\\nI walked away stuffed and thoroughly enjoyed the wait staff, ambiance, my company and of course, the cuisine.\\n\\n\\n#Yelp 365 - 8/365"},{"name":"NaraDeva Thai Restaurant","address":"4696 Millenia Plz Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Solid Thai restaurant.

There was a cashier of some sort who directed us to a hostess. Though there was no one ahead of us in line, she told us it would be a 20-30 minutes wait and to sit at the bar. I asked if it was okay if my 18 year old sister sits at the bar, since in our hometown, that's illegal. She told me to just get her a Coke. Duh. After 10 minutes at the bar, where the staff just seemed confused, our name was called. I paid for my beer and the hostess rushed me to get upstairs to get my table. The second hostess upstairs, pushed us off on someone else. It took us a solid fifteen minutes of sitting before the waitress came over and left when she saw we already had drinks. The whole meal, the waitress wasn't overly friendly or nice.\\n\\nThe choice was limited. I knew there was going to be seafood, but I didn't know that was the only thing they sold; neither my sister or I are big fans. But, we got soup (awesome chowder) to start and had seafood platters and fried shrimp between us. The portions were good and the food's not bad, but I know my sister would've enjoyed a burger more. Guess we should have asked for a menu before we sat! The waitress did give us a free lemonade since my sister's Sprite was flat twice, which was nice of her.\\n\\nHonestly, I think the only reason this place stays in business is because of it's historical claim to fame.

We were 15 minutes late -- mostly because it's so freakin' hard to find this place -- and I have been here multiple times! It's located back behind some postal buildings and warehouses and there is no sign out by the road to direct you to the restaurant. Despite being late for our reservation, we were seated right away. Our small table was right next to the giant wall of windows at the back of the restaurant and had a great view of some of the Atlanta skyline. Next time, I will request to be seated outside because it looked so nice out there! The restaurant is definitely loud, but it's got a fun atmosphere and yummy food. \\n\\nThey have special drinks called \\"infusions\\" that they change mostly every day, which is what they do with their menu as well. I chose the Big Ass Burger, and the name is right on. It was so big and juicy, I could only eat about a quarter of it. I substituted the onion rings for their amazingly cheesy mac-n-cheese. We started with the cheese fritters, which were tiny and spicy and pretty good. I also had a salad of arugula, cranberries, walnuts, cheese and a good fruity dressing - I ate every bite. No wonder I couldn't finish even half of my burger... We were told by the waitress that the tuna is her favorite on the menu, and the girl next to us was raving about it as well. My boyfriend chose the scallops and said they were some of the best he has had. Surprising coming from a restaurant not known seafood. Needless to say, we had not one bit of room left for dessert, so we skipped it this time around. Their cupcakes and ice cream are pretty tasty, though. \\n\\nMy least favorite part of dining there was the valet. The area where you pick up and drop off your cars is not set up very well, as there is only one ramp in and out.

Fish & chips dinner for me and roast beef for my brother.  The menu, which I got 1 week ago, clearly states the fish is FRESH haddock.  Menu also says dish comes with tartar sauce.  Right away upon opening the container you could tell something was seriously wrong.  The fish smelled extremely fishy and was as flat as a pancake.  Breading was soggy and fish was completely dried out...like you would expect from freezer burned frozen fish.  I could only take two bites before spitting it out and feeling queasy (I do not have a weak stomach at all).  It tasted like old frozen fish that was then not cooked correctly.  You know, I'm not expecting a grand meal from a roast beef shop.  However, I expect to 1. Not be lied to on the menu and 2. At least get edible food.  This fish was atrocious.  Worst I've ever had and I've had my fair share of fish & chips.  My brother's roast beef was good.  He also tried a bite of the fish and had to spit it out and wash out his mouth. That's how disgusting it was.  Also, no tartar sauce included, which again is stated on the menu as coming with the meal....not that I could have eaten it any way. So, this order was delivered and I was so upset by the quality of this food and wasting $12 of my money that I drove to the restaurant to personally return it.  The girl at the counter looked to another girl who appeared to maybe be a manager, who told her to give me my money back. I told her that it smelled and tasted fishy and was definitely frozen.  Now here's the best part of this whole nightmare....she says, \\"Yeah, all the fish is frozen.  We use frozen fillets.  We tell people if they ask.\\". Why would I ever think to ask this if their newly printed menus clearly state it is FRESH fish being used?!?!  I told her the menu says it's fresh.  She had no response...just walked away to make more horrible misrepresented food I guess.  Also, no apology for the the food or me having to drive there to return it.  And no thank you for me trying to help them not do a disservice and lie to their customers. Never again!!!

You would think that as time progressed that they would adapt to accepting checks as well as credit or debit. So what's stopping them?\\n\\nAs you wait in line, you may find yourselves harassed by street characters who will ask you for money. I was once standing in line and this one homeless guy berated the whole crowd because nobody would give him a quarter. One of Old Town's problems is the homeless population which is quite neglected by the City of Portland. There's also a strong police presence in Old Town, so it'd be both nice and convenient if they could send more patrols to pass by Voodoo and through Ankeny Alley. That way patrons could feel a little less bothered.\\n\\nTo top it all off, the donuts are not really all that good. I mean, they're not bad, but they're not all that great either. They're more colorful and creative than they are delicious. I'll still give Voodoo props for being original and helping to put Portland on the map, but that is about it.\\n\\nI go into Old Town quite a bit and actually pass by this donut shop a lot, but ironically, in the past several years I've only been to this shop three times. I'm still willing to give them a chance because they are an unquestionable slice of Portland, but I wish they would make some serious improvements. I mean already they've made their sidewalk much more pedestrian-friendly and added a whole outdoor eating area.

I don't think so).  The combo is any four items from the a la carte menu for $11.95.  \\n\\nI loved the combo, although it did disappoint me that my least favorite item turned out to be the sausages.  They were \\"off\\" somehow, not quite to the point where I wondered \\"is this safe to eat\\", but more along the lines of \\"is there liver in this?\\"  It was not remotely like any breakfast sausage I've ever had.  Another disappointment was the waiter, who told me that the corn pudding was sweet.  It wasn't.  It was purely savory.  \\n\\nIt may seem surprising that I am giving them 5 stars despite my imperfect first brunch, but I've been a couple of times before for dinner, and I've always loved it.  I have tended to stick to the lower-priced, regular hot-dog items on the menu ($3.50), and they've all been great.  Their cocktails are also inventive and well-made, although they are more expensive (but still in line with every other restaurant downtown--nice cocktails are just expensive these days).

In the case of the Hot BBQ, it was pretty tasty, but the hot garlic tasted kind of weird, and the hot peach habanero was just flat out not good. There's a lot of different flavor mixing going on here, much like you can do at Rooster's, but I just wasn't a fan. Also, as you can see in my picture, your wings will swim in the sauces, so if you don't mind that, you might like the place.\\n\\nI've also had the onion rings, and they aren't bad but not great, and the potato wedges are way overpriced for the handful that they give you.

Many were having New England seafood for the first time.  The service was good and they accommodated my large group even though I made the reservation that afternoon.  The food however, was another story.  We shared many items and nothing was as good as I get at any of the seafood restaurants I frequent on Cape Cod.  The raw oysters came with a plastic container of nearly frozen cocktail sauce and another of horseradish.  The oysters were still attached to the shell, unlike the ones that just slide off everywhere else.  The fried whole belly clams were mushy and half were left uneaten.  The lobster casserole consisted of only claw tips.  There was not a shred of tail meat and so we sent it back.  The mussels and steamers were good although they forgot the garlic bread with the mussels.  The Oysters Rockefeller and Grilled Oysters were very similar and both were bland but not bad.  The clam chowder was good but bland and needed pepper.  We had to ask for the oyster crackers.  One of my party of 27 did get food poisoning a few hours later and another one of our party sent back their dish because it had a hair in it.  The decor of the restaurant was nice but the small room we were in reverberated noise and it was virtually impossible to talk to anyone at our table besides the person next to you.  Not even the person across from you.  (There was one other very loud party in the room and their noise filled the room.)

While they technically don't reserve table seats, they told me they'd make note of it and would try their best.  When we arrived that evening, we checked in and they mentioned we might have to wait a bit for a window table.  Totally fine, we'll just sit in the lounge area and sip on some wine.  About 20 minutes go by, and the hostess comes over to tell us that our table is ready.  She proceeds to bring us to the far back corner of the restaurant where a rectangular table was rotated obscurely to fit by the window and alarmingly close to the table next to us.  We all look at each other and say, \\"Isn't there an ACTUAL window table that we can wait for, without us being ridiculously uncomfortable?\\"  The hostess responded, \\"Oh yes, I just didn't think you would want to wait any longer.\\"  Um, here's a thought: you could ASK!  I just thought it was really sneaky that they tried to stick us at a makeshift table without even asking us if we minded waiting a little bit more.  Hmph.\\nSo we went back to the lounge area and enjoyed the jazz music and gorgeous view of such a gorgeous city.  After another 10 minutes, we were taken to a completely adequate window table and the hostess apologized to us profusely.  Our waiter greeted us and answered any questions we had about the menu and gave recommendations as well.  There was nothing on the menu that stood out for me; it seemed there was always one ingredient in the dishes that I found unappealing.  I ended up getting the spinach salad and the pork chop.  Both were okay, but nothing spectacular.  \\nAt this point we're all extremely full and not even thinking about dessert when the hostess comes back over with a huge plate of delicious smelling cookies and puts it right in the center of our table.  She apologizes again for the misunderstanding before and we all decide that we now love her.  The cookies were soft and moist and totally made up for our pre-meal malady.  \\nSo it ended up being a decent meal, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant, as I think there's much finer places to eat in Boston.

Anyhow, it was my first time ever trying French Onion Soup and I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. My boyfriend thought it wasn't cheesy enough and his old workplace does a better rendition of it. The Truffled Poutine was not bad, I like the crispiness of the fries, the cheese were stringy and squeaky but there wasn't enough gravy :( Finally, the Suckling Pig. It comes with homemade sauerkraut, schupfnudel, a German noodle, and hot mustard on the side. It was good for what it was; the pig was moist, the sauerkraut was sauerkraut, and the schupfnudel had an interesting doughy texture. The Spaetzle had a similar texture to it except it was topped and baked with cheese. \\n\\nFor dessert we shared the Creme Br√ªl√©e, the top caramel was thicker than I'm used to and the custard was really creamy and eggy.

The karamiso (spicy miso) ramen broth has a deep red color, but its more color than kick. The pork cheeks that come with your ramen are superb - soft, flavorful and fatty. Toppings come artfully arranged, and the presentation is a nice touch with each bowl coming with a cute tray and a long spoon.\\n\\nFor me, the noodles were a really big disappointment - especially with how well the broth was done. They were a bit on the thin side, and slightly curly. Overall, it just felt like the noodles didn't really hold their own in the broth, and came off as pretty bland. \\n\\nIt's on the pricey side (bowls range from 11-15$ and portions are on the small side), but nothing obscene given the other ramen offerings in the area. The extra $2 for the egg seems a bit skimpy, but their egg was well done with a nice, soft yolk so I guess we can let that slide.\\n\\nI would say 3 stars for the food, but the service was super nice and attentive, and the broth, meat and presentation would bump it up to a 3.5 or 4 for me.

Clean interior with nice settings, and service staff dressed in black/white.

I had a stuffed baked lobster, it was just too rich, and the lobster meat was tough from being baked. Wished I'd just had a steamed lobster instead. The fried clams were good though! And the clam chowder was the best that either of us had ever had. \\n\\nI did have a couple of complaints - when I made the reservation about a month before we'd be there, I'd asked to be seated in the JFK booth. That didn't happen, and I can't believe that booth is booked up for a month in advance, but maybe it is. I think they just didn't bother to make note of my request. We actually stopped in the next day for lunch, and the JFK booth was empty, so I asked to sit there. The hostess said she'd check for us and sat us in the booth across. Well she never came back, and no one sat in the JFK booth while we were there. It was not that big of a deal so we dropped it.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's meant to be.\\n\\nTo start, service here is very attentive and you are greeted right away, if the place is full, they will put your name on the waitlist and you can wait in the front area outside the restaurant. They provide you with a menu to look at while you wait and even offer to bring you beverages while you wait; they have a small beer selection. Being a ramen shop, the turnaround is quick and service here is definitely very efficient.\\n\\nNow to the food, I ordered Tan Tan ramen because it's a pretty unique offering and I read good things about it. Total disappointment - I'm not sure if it's because I'm familiar to traditional Chinese Dan Dan noodles but this was a weird combination of flavors like they couldn't nail the balance of sesame sauce with spices and other seasonings. Secondly, the 'spicy' part was lacking and that is CRITICAL in my opinion to anything you're going to label 'Tan Tan'. Thirdly, there was an almost non-existent amount of ground pork in my dish which is kind of annoying because in a typical ramen you get 2-3 slices of sliced pork which is usually the premier ramen meat so one should not be skimpy with ground pork. I really had to DIG in my bowl to find just a few measly bits of pork. Just enough so you can't say there wasn't any at all in your bowl.\\n\\n$14 for this was very disappointing.

It's located in a cute little neighborhood off Division and it's a pretty small venue situated in a row of several other bars/restaurants/shops. \\n\\nOn a Sunday morning, parking was surprisingly easy. I was about an hour early to meet the friend I was going to be dining with, so I killed some time at the K&F Clinton Street Coffee house across the street. As is standard with these tiny Portland breakfast spots, there is going to be a wait. I started to see people waiting outside so with about 30 minutes left before my friend was supposed to meet me, I walked over and put our names on the list. \\n\\nIf I was going to give this place three stars, this would be why: You actually put your name on a sign-up sheet at the bar next door, and there is no hostess there to tell you how long the wait is going to be (for some people or on some occasions, the time of the wait determines your plans. If it's a few minutes fine, but if it's going to be a while you might go elsewhere - or head across the street for a cup of coffee or go browse the other shops around to kill time). There was about four parties in front of me, so I figured by the time my friend showed up, we would be close to being seated - or I would have just gotten the table. \\n\\nBut here is what was not good: the waiter is coming out to check off names and seat people and starts asking 'if all your party is here.' For me, she wasn't so I said she was on her way. I get why they do this as they don't want someone sitting down an hour early to get a table while other people have to wait. BUT, I was there, had been waiting about 30 minutes, put my name in like everyone else and my friend was almost there. However, since our full party wasn't there, he began seating people on the list AFTER me. About three minutes later my friend shows up and we had to wait another 15 minutes as I was not seated in order. That's not really good service but whatever. We let is slide. \\n\\nWe got two seats at the bar and the waitstaff was extremely friendly - which is sometimes hard to find in the hipster-super cool spots. We ordered two mimosa's, the Danish pancakes and the open-faced breakfast sandwich to share. Then we watched as the cook made the food in front of us, which was pretty entertaining. \\n\\nAs for the food/service: waitstaff was friendly and prompt. Other reviews have stated they had to wait a long time or never got condiments that they asked for, but we didn't have that problem. We asked for some hot sauce and the waiter opened a cupboard up and asked us what we preferred from three or four bottles of hot sauces they had. Our silverware was delivered without asking and the waiter checked several times to see if we wanted anything else - (this might seem standard but in cities like Portland, getting the waiter to even acknowledge you can see like five-star service). \\n\\nDanish pancakes were soft and fresh and chewy and the lemon curd and jelly was just the right amount of sweet. The breakfast sandwich was good, however I can see perhaps it being a little bland for some. The breakfast cheese doesn't have a lot of taste, but I also think it is authentic... so it just is what it is. There was a little bit of sauce on the sandwich as well, but a little extra hot sauce did the trick. I can easily see some palates preferring a little extra salt and pepper. Mimosa's were standard in taste and price. \\n\\nAll in all, $35 for two cocktails and two entrees, split between two people seems like a fair price for what we got. I would definitely go back for a second try."},{"name":"Coconut Cafe","address":"759 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"I think this is a staple of thai food in Newton.

Serving a high quality beef product ought to merit a better quality roll, its that simple. \\n My burger was overcooked and salty, and the vegetarian choice (chic pea burger) had nice flavor but was like eating mashed potatoes in between bread, would not hold together at all and was next to impossible to eat without a fork. The french fries are extra, good, but four bucks.  I agree with other reviewers that for the totals that you end up paying for your dinner, the plastic dinner ware and cups is sort of odd.

Mostly because the offerings have awesome names.  I mean where can you get items called Bambi vs. Godzilla or Notorious P.I.G?  Anyways... 2 hot dogs ended up coming out to be $19!!!\\n\\nWell, nonetheless I had to try the B v. G and Notorious P.I.G dogs... they just looked so unique.\\n\\nThis hot doggery serves up EXTREMELY gourmet dogs in a bar-casual eatery type setting, and the main appeal is definitely the fine touch done on the dogs.  Not that you can even get close by simply calling them hot dogs...  These sausages are hand crafted, and daily specials are centered around them.\\n\\nThe Bambi Vs. Godzilla was a kobe beef, venison, pork sausage served with lemon goat cheese, pickled okra, tomatoes, and onion.  Sure all of these components were unique, but when it came right down to it, $8.75 couldn't justify the serving.  With a somewhat light seasoning, it ultimately tasted of: sweet and gamey sausage; mild, runny goat cheese; sour okra; and veggies.  Disappointing in flavors, but good in character.\\n\\nThe Notorious P.I.G was another fun attempt that fell short.  A nice porky sausage with serrano peppers, bacon, and ham sat on barbeque sauce and under macaroni in cheese.  Again, the base flavors came out so it ended up being: spicy sausage, sweet sauce, bland macaroni noodles with a bit of cheddar.  Nowhere near $9.25 of quality.\\n\\nI really wanted to enjoy this place, but the execution of the really crazy food was not perfect.  No matter how good the hot dog, I wouldn't go with the expensive daily specials.  Stick with their basics and it should be affordable.  No one should be paying $20 for 2 sausages on buns."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice atmosphere although I found the decor very generic....you'll find places that look this in every city you might travel.

When the waitress brought it to our table we were told that, the kitchen staff had made the wrong pizza and had to remake it.  After we started to eat our pizza we realized that the cook had basically added toppings to an overcooked previously made cheese pizza, then reheated the entire pizza to make it look like it'd been freshly made.

Decided to go shortly after they opened to beat the rush. They've been slammed every day since opening- and it doesn't look like it's going to slow down.\\n\\nReview should be taken with a giant grain of salt since this was my first hamburger in over 15 years. I've been going back to meat in a slow fashion and have been avoiding the burger thing since it was a really awful burger that put me on the road to vegetarianism 18 years ago. So my knowledge of the modern day burger is, admittedly, limited.\\n\\nWith that noted: I thought it was pretty fabulous. I decided to go big- had the bacon cheeseburger with egg on top. It was messy and juicy and kinda awesome. Onion rings were okay, a little greasy for my taste. Friend went with a bunless burger w/ avocado and really enjoyed it (she's healthier than I am). And we shared some beet fries, which will be why I continue to go back to GF. Sweet potato fries are for suckers- beets are where it's at.\\n\\nMany of the reviews seem to be missing the point. It's a fancy-ass burger joint with high grade product. You aren't going to pay $5.00 for a burger. As a point of comparison, I just looked up prices at Red Robin (my dining partner's preferred fast food burger joint). The same burger I ate (burger, cheese, bacon, egg) runs $9.99 at Red Robin. I paid $10.25 at Grass Fed. And I'm pretty sure the beef quality at Red Robin can't even compare to the happy cow stuff being used by GF. (Not to mention the fact that it's all locally sourced- the buns are made by the dude who runs Blue Frog  bakery down the street- how awesome is that?)\\n\\nAnd size? I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a dainty girl, but I couldn't finish my burger- thought it was plenty big. Dining partner (another dainty girl) and I decided that next time we'd split a burger and get a large order of beet fries and we'd be more than happy and set (throw in a milk shake and we'd probably be hurting).\\n\\nThe non essentials: I like the ambience- clean, bright, modern. No tables, it's all bar-type seating, which doesn't bother me as I don't really think they are aiming for the \\"let large groups linger over their burger\\" crowd. It's definitely fast food. I really hate reviews where people slam a place for it not being what they envisioned the restaurant to be. Judge it for what it is, not what you think it should be. It's not trying to be a sit down restaurant so why would I take off points because it isn't one?\\n\\nAnyway- I thought GF was plenty awesome and will definitely return; I need to give the veggie option a spin and try out some milkshakes."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is a must-see when visiting Portland.

Wow, their bartender can make a good Old-Fashioned. \\n\\nWe each split deserts and the chocolate cake was trademark lava cake w/ vanilla ice cream, which was great.  A DOWNSIDE, though is that the waitress came by to ask how everything was... while I was still waiting for my espresso to arrive after the deserts had arrived.\\n\\nThe Espresso arrived just in time for my wife & I to finish the small lava cake & scoop of ice cream. My friend hat to get the waitresses attention again, so i could get some sugar.\\n \\nMy wife didn't finish HALF of her entree, which she really enjoyed - she asked them to box it up for her. We got home this evening & only her sandwich was in there. She is not happy to say the least.\\n\\nI'm curious what they did with her sweet potato fries & cup of pickles??? \\nThey serve the pickles in cups - maybe they just recycle them to the next customer - EWWW!\\n\\nDid they toss those fries?\\n\\nDid the \\"new guy\\" not understand, \\"I'd like to take this home\\"?\\n\\nLONG story short: Good food, mediocre service. Trying to be elegant dining, but treating me like I'm at a Friendly's. \\n\\nNo Thank You.  \\nI'LL spend my money elsewhere, which is sad, since you make such a nice old-fashioned."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's ordinary tasting doughnuts but presented in a very creative way.

Done and done.  That and a Caesar salad for $3 and a few beers made for a pretty good meal.  Plus the portions here aren't your normal small happy hour portion.  The salad was pretty damn big.  Not huge big, but big big.  The burger was fine for $5.  Not the best you'll get here in town, but a good deal at happy hour.\\n\\nThe place is Ok.  It was better when we got there and it was quiet.  Ultimately the crowds came and it had that frat boy vibe to it (backwards baseball caps, sunglass wearing indoors).  They have one of those machines with the punching bag that you punch once with all of your might and get your score.

The overhead is really low, especially when you're selling it out of a trailer instead of an actual restaurant. In a place like Austin you can (obviously) get away with selling small pizza's for around $14, but I always feel like a bit of a sucker for buying it.

Balsamic and vinegar has a tendency to have that effect on my face, especially when confronted with SOOO much of it. \\nNeither of us could finish our salads. In fact, we took only one bite. Our waiter (who's name was Miguel and was fantastic) took them back to the kitchen and then returned to inform us that the chef said, 'that's how they do it Italy and that's how he does it.' Ok, I can appreciate staying authentic to 'how they do it in Italy' but a lot of the dishes on the menu stray from traditional. And not to mention, is it not important to taste ALL the flavors? Not just those in the dressing?\\nAnyway, if you order salad and you don't like tasting nothing but dressing, then have them put in on the side.\\nAnd moving on. Enough of the salad. As you can guess, I didn't like it very much.\\n\\nThe decor was nice. And so you know, when I use the word 'nice', it's more like a notch above 'ok' with a hint of sarcasm. \\nI think the name sorta is decieving a little bit. I guess I kinda imagined a more homey, yet elegant Italian kitchen feel. Not so modern and sleek (basically boring and predicatable) It's almost like decorators and interior designers in the Orlando area are afraid to take chances.\\n\\nBack to the food. It's great. Everything tasted wonderful (except, let me say it again, the salad) and the wait staff was very attentive. That's why it is deserving of the four stars.\\nI would return here again someday. But with so many new and wonderful places yet to discover...it will be some time. I'm sure they'll still be around though!\\nUntil next time, eat, drink and be merry!\\nTiphanie"},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I had the sushi salad and crab cake slider during their happy hour costing less than $10 total.

The donuts were good, but not awesome that I would want to stand in a long line again."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for lunch during my visit to Austin.

My friend and I decided to order 3 small plates and split them. We both love mussels and they were amazing!!! aromatic with garlic, sweet and nutty! The crostini served with them? OMG. Then we ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese! HELLO? Lobster? And Mac and Cheese? I fancy myself a Mac and Cheese Officianoto so I know what I'm talking about here! THEN the Finale! The pineapple shrimp fried rice! Sweet and savory in an amazing pineapple shell! GEEZE! And let's top this off with my Plum Wine. They put a tiny infused plum in my plum wine! It tasted as if Jesus himself stuck His toe in my wine! And the bartender today was just a complete treasure. AND I found out one of the waiters did the graphic designs for the signs and styled the d√©cor! Man... this place. Even the patrons are FUN and interesting! I love this place. I will be back over and over and over and over...."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"A must stop...

Almost everything we've had here has been amazing.  Great sashimi with strong wasabi, fantastic grilled salmon entree, even the green tea unusually good.  Great service, atmosphere, presentation - 5 stars!"},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by my boyfriend's boss and I must say, we were not disappointed! We made it for the end of the lunch hour so it wasn't very busy. Everything from the atmosphere to the service to the food was stupendous. The restaurant has a rustic nautical look to it with a very open dining area and an oyster bar. We got great service from our waitress Christin who was very helpful in answering our questions about the food. Everything we tried was good but my two favorite dishes were the mussels in a thai coconut curry sauce and the fries with chowder and bacon. Who knew potatoes and chowder went so well together (being from the west coast I could be missing something big here). And the coconut curry sauce was one of the best I've ever had. Definitely will recommend this place to anyone living in or visiting Atlanta."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Team Oh ready for eating, was only met halfway. Our fault.\\n\\nDO go get the pancakes, they are some of the best in Boston.\\n\\nDO NOT get an eggs, hashbrowns and toast breakfast, we accidentally make better food than that.\\n\\nWe love this place, we really do. The way they do breakfast is just different enough to make it interesting while still making it work. Cafeteria style serving, wait in line, order our food and by the time you are ready to pay it's done and you can chow down because someone has just left their seat.\\n\\nOn a side note, if you order the Crab Cake BLT right when they do the changeover from breakfast to lunch, you will be happy.\\n\\n-oh"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Save yourself money, calories, and time - this place is a tourist trap with long lines known for their ridiculous names and crazy concoctions.

Pull up to the order screen...and wait 6 minutes for our order to be taken. At this point I started timing carefully. FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER we're 3rd in line to the window, and trapped by the curb - no escape possible unless I get the cars behind me to all back up. 5 minutes later (now it's been 26 minutes) an employee takes payment from the front car. 6 minutes after that they get their drink. Then it's a full 11 minutes till they get their food and pull away. Repeat service for next car. Now we're next in line if the poor soul in front of us ever gets served. We've already given up, just waiting to escape, and while we wait I go commiserate with the 3 cars behind, telling them to above all, \\"DO NOT give any payment until you see food - they will take your $ hostage and make you wait 15-20 minutes!\\" I tell the manager \\"Get your resume out - I'm contacting the franchise owner tomorrow to get you fired!\\" Which I didn't do, at wife's request, gotta show mercy towards anyone who tries to manage a bunch of lazy ignorant no-call-no-show losers. A better part of an hour, wasted in anger. We stopped up at Ingles on Glade road (love Ingles) and got a great deli sammich. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ARBYS."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"1253 Caroline St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I love Five Guys! It's a little pricey but the food is always exactly what you need it to be. I particularly like the cajun fries. I'm so happy they've added a small/little fry option because you get a lot. The burgers are ordered by the patty and you can fix them up with several toppings. The bun is soft and flavorful as well. If you're a peanut lover, you can scoop you some as you wait. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and it's a good spot to people watch. The customer service is not always great but overall good for the most part. Parking can be annoying but you have several options: street, lot, garage. Just depends on your luck on that particular day."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service, great food, awesome vibe.

Because of that, the wait here is atrocious if you don't get there early.  You wait in line and the cooks take your order.  By the time you get out of line there is sure a place for you sit.  I had the two eggs special and blueberry pancakes.  The blueberry pancakes were good as they use fresh blueberries but pricey.  The eggs and home fries were just average.
