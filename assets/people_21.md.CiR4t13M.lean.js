Before I start - this is my 100th review! Now that we have that out of the way, let me get down to business. So restaurant week is on, and my friend and I were wondering which ones we should try out. I don't usually go out to expensive restaurants outside of this oh-so-special week. We narrowed down to this one for lunch. My friend is a steak w***e. Also, bubble tea, cheesecake.. Let's leave her on that note.\\n\\nAs you enter, you check in your coat while your server will take you to the table. We were seated downstairs which is a little dim compared to the upstairs. But I like it that way. The initial bread and butter was usual though their bread is served warm unlike some places I know of. One big star just for that Ruth's Chris! Here's the rest of what we ordered -\\n\\nSTARTERS - Steak House Salad and Louisiana Seafood Gumbo. I have nothing much to say about the salad. It was as expected. The veggies were fresh and the dressing was just enough to give it a light taste.\\n\\nFOOD - Petite Filet (medium rare) and Marinated Chicken. Delicious! Both the thingies were perfect to taste. They serve the food on hot plates blah blah. Everyone already mentioned that in their review. The food comes out sizzling and stays warm so you enjoy your meal to the last bite. Needless to say, you can request your steak your way and they will do it for you.\\n\\nSIDES - Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Spinach. The potatoes are very rich in taste and therefore end up being heavy. The spinach tastes very good and is perfect with the chicken. We didn't end up finishing both of them because of the rich taste. Not because they were bad, just heavy for two average sized girls (fine, women).\\n\\nALCOHOL - Beer. They serve bottled beer. I'm too average to order wine :) Nah, we wanted to enjoy just the food and beer was what we felt like. The glass they served it in remained chilled for the longest time..\\n\\nDESSERT - My favorite part of the meal, always.. Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. Omg! I think this was the best thing they served. I really really really liked it. I liked it so much, I wanted to get a room with it. I'm not kiddin'.\\n\\nService is good, fast and they don't push you. I should mention - we went in for lunch so we weren't too dressy. I think dinner is when you should dress it up a bit. We were in comfortable jeans and some nice shirts with a jacket thrown in, if that helps anyone. Just don't wear a t-shirt and old sneakers.. That's it. Go try it, you'll love it.

I heard about this place quite a while ago but never made it there til now.  I think because of all the hype, I was definitely disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place, but I wouldn't have given it more than 4 stars on a typical trip.  \\n\\nThe good points:  the fish is friggin' fresh!  Some of the freshest seafood I've had in a while.  I wanted to ask them who their supplier was, cuz the quality of the product was excellent.  \\n\\nSo why the 3 stars \\"A-Ok\\" status?  Well, for me, at a Japanese sushi restaurant, it's also  about the preparation and presentation as well.  Although the ingredients were fantastic, the preparation of the fish, as evidenced by the cuts and manipulation of the rice and other ingredients, was lacking.  Sadly, the preparation looked like it was from a 2-star quantity-over-quality style of restaurant.  I think I've been to AYCE Japanese restaurants with a similar level of skill in sushi preparation.  It almost looked like a hipster-ironic joke.  \\n\\nAnother bone to pick was that I felt like the recipes were made without much care and attention to detail.  The clam miso soup tasted like miso soup mix with fresh clams dropped in.  The clams were delicious, but the soup was rather bland, not much flavor.  Hardly any tofu or fresh green onions.  They gave me what I ordered, but there was no pride or heart in what they gave me.  It was an industrialized product made by a private chain of restaurants.  \\n\\nI think the reputation of this restaurant is high because it's been around for so long.  Kind of like how Sun Sui Wah has an amazing reputation, although their food is (to me) just so-so, especially for the price.  \\n\\nI personally would have rather gone to the chic Mega Sushi up the road on Moncton (Location #2), or even over to Village Sushi Bar at the tip of No. 2 Road, where the seafood is just as fresh, but the food tastes real."},{"name":"Linn City Pub","address":"19389 Willamette Dr","city":"West Linn","stars":"4","text":"Usually this place is super reliable.

Right from the start I was blown away by the calamari. It was fried to perfection, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. There was also fried peppers as part of the calamari appetizer that gave a savory, spicy kick on the side. The linguini didn't disappoint either. There was no shortage of mussels and clams, and the Fra Diavolo sauce was magnificent.\\n\\nGiacomo's is cash only, but provided that I am back in Boston again I will come back time and time again for the calamari and to try their abundance of other dishes and specials on their menu.\\n\\nAdded picture!"},{"name":"1921 Mount Dora","address":"142 E 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"This place is cheffed by the legendary Norman van Aken, the only Floridian chef to be inducted into the prestigious James Beard list of \\"Who's Who in American Food and Beverage\\" and voted best chef.

An old friend & I journeyed down to the Landing on a cold Friday night around 6:30 expecting a wait but happy to find several empty tables awaiting our arrival.  Our very adept waiter, Trevor, appeared within seconds offering to take out drink orders. I quickly decided on a G-Louis Cab Sav @ $9.00/glass & my companion followed with the same.  Trevor returned within minutes with our requested wines.  It took one whiff from me (a bone-fide wine snob) to know this wine had been open back in the stone age & was oxidized. When I offered said glass to Trevor to validate my observation, he agreed & almost immediately returned with 2 fresh glasses of a newly opened bottle. Nice!\\nAs I'm a bit of a spice freak, I was intrigued by the evening's special offering of a spicy calamari in tomato sauce. When I asked if it came over pasta, Trevor said it did not, but I could order a side of penne for $4.00 (FOUR DOLLARS!!!) Seriously?  However, because of the wine faux-pas, he said there would be no charge.  Good thing because when I got my calamari, the side plate of penne was countable to the tune of 20 pieces! Had I have had to pay for this paltry plate, I would have been irate!  \\nGoing forward, the calamari was, as advertised, spicy (yum) & tender (more yum) and even the meager portion of penne were cooked al dente. The tomato sauce was well executed and, I might be going out on a limb here, made with good San Marzano tomatoes.  Loaded with pepperoncini to provide the requisite spice, it was all-in all a good dish but @ $15, it was a good thing Trevor threw in the penne @ no charge.  \\nMy dining companion had the mushroom & bacon pizza which was very good.  I dipped the thin  crust into the brodo  of my calamari and it was so good.  \\nDishes coming out to the left & right of us looked and smelled great, albeit some of the fried entrees looked a bit dark. When we inquired to our seated neighbors how they liked their food, all had a thumbs up.  \\nService tonight looked like they had 3 waiters on and all were appropriately attentive.\\nUpon arrival of our check, we were given a $5.00 off coupon for a breakfast for 2 to be consumed before 2/28. Certainly an enticement to return as if our most pleasant & attentive waiter Trevor wasn't enough!\\nA little work in the wine department -- don't serve oxidized reds-- and serving food just a little hotter would rate a 5 star next visit which I am sure to make!"},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm not a fan of tomato sauce...and my friend totally did not know this and decided to take me here..

The Salt Lick is ridiculously awesome.  The drive from Austin is scenic, littered with wildflowers in springtime and coming upon the enormous bbq compound is like finding the Unicorn Treasure.  Manpanion and I shared the lunch combo plate for $9.95, which was 3/4ths a pound of meat, brisket, smoked turkey & pork ribs.  All were outstandingly tender and delicious.  Being a mayonnaise-hater, I have little interest in BBQ eatery's sides of potato salad and coleslaw, however, Salt Lick meat candy is accompanied by delicious mayo-free slaw and pot-salad!  Incredible!  The slaw was asian-influenced, with sesame seeds and was a terrific, crunchy palate-cleanser after a bite of melty-tangy brisket.  The bbq sauce is a mustard-based tangy delight, with little cane sugar and no icky corn syrup, leaving no weird corn-syrupy aftertaste, another thrill! The potato salad is also mustard-ee, a creamy, cool nibble after a mouthful of fall-off-the-bone rib!  The eatery is located in a huge pioneer-lodge-for-giants, and the tables are enormous wooden slabs, with wooden benches.  The plates are melmac-ish, divided in sections, which is perfect for a dipping pool of extra bbq sauce.  Many people go for the all-you-can-eat for $14.95 lunch, $18.95 dinner.  A shared lunch combo, which also came with 2 tender rolls and pickles, left us room for a generous wedge of totally delicious & homemade pecan pie; which was like caramel custard/pudding/gooey-yumyum.

That said, tonight a large group of my friends decided to try it out and here are some initial impressions.  The atmosphere is definitely in a diner motif but it feels intimate, not sterile.  The menu is large offering a wide variety of sandwiches, burgers, salads and other comfort foods in addition to a full breakfast menu which is available anytime.  Our group was impressed by the variety and everyone ended up picking something different.  I had a caesar salad with a side of onion rings (I can never resist those).  The salad was a generous portion but otherwise very average.  It was served luke warm and the chicken was simply grilled with no seasoning.  The croutons were also just simply hard pieces of bread.  Overall, it looked better than it tasted.  The onion rings likewise were served luke warm and while generous in size, lacked any real kick.  They needed some salt or dipping sauce to give them some interest.\\n\\nThe rest of my group ordered a wide variety of entrees including various burgers, the turkey club, meatloaf, fish and chips and pot pie.  Everyone's response was the same, it was \\"ok.\\"  The biggest compliment came from the fries which everyone seemed to enjoy.  Otherwise people felt most of the entrees were just a little off.  For example the meatloaf came with a mustard style gravy which nobody seemed to care for.  One person ordered the Garbage Plate which was basically a burger, macaroni salad and fries all piled together.  They felt the macaroni salad was too sweet and cold and didn't go together with the rest.\\n\\nService was slow as is often the case with a new restaurant.  Our meal took about 2 hours from when we arrived until we finally checked out simply because the food too so long in the kitchen.  I'm sure this will improve over time.  Prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly.\\n\\nI'm sure I'll go back to try out their breakfast menu but I'm not sure I'll be back for the main menu.  Don't get me wrong, nobody thought it was bad and in general, the menu had great possibilities.  What was missing was the translation of those possibilities into tasty realities.

And when I found out that there was a bookstore similar to Kramer's in Boston, I had to go take a look.\\n\\nSo yesterday evening, after a quick stop at Urban Outfitters across the street, I hopped over to Trident for a quick bite and a little magazine catchup before heading home. \\n\\nI step in and am immediately greeted by the magazine rack. First magazines I see: Nylon and Giant Robot, nearest to the door. Perfect. I grab both and head to the bar, five steps away.\\n\\nI sit down, and look around. Everything is nice and cozy, just as a bookstore should be, especially when it's a local business such as Trident, and I couldn't be happier. Happy people, happy reading, happy drinking (coffee).\\n\\nI'm caught up in people watching, but after a few minutes, I realize something. Noone came by to ask me if I wanted a menu. I look around to see if they're extra busy, but they're not. I'm one of 4 people at the bar, out of maybe 15 empty seats. Slightly annoyed by this sudden realization, I call after a waiter for a menu, the one who had been standing in front of me chatting, who quickly apologizes for the oversight. All is good.\\n\\nI order a fresh squeezed orange juice and the special of the day - risotto with gouda, spinach, and tomatoes. Sounds delicious. The waiter confirms that it is. In fact, he prefers it over the other special of the day - ziti with chicken, broccoli, and cream sauce. Darn, because that also sounded pretty satisfying on a cold night.\\n\\nTo my surprise, the juice arrived almost immediately. Nice. But upon tasting it, I had myself another surprise. This was not fresh squeezed orange juice. This was sour, store-bought orange juice with artificial flavoring and a speckle of pulp to emulate the \\"fresh squeezed\\" in the title. Incredible. I am so taken aback by how misled I was that I laugh out loud. Laughter soothes the soul, they say.\\n\\nOne Nylon issue later, the waiter brings me silverware along with a purple mat with a scalloped edge for the dish. Cute. Soon enough, the risotto arrives in all of its glory. A yellow mound of mushy, overcooked goop in a deep dish, mixed with spinach, tomatoes, and melting pieces of gouda. I pick at it with a fork, and already, there is a skin forming atop the risotto. It's been sitting out too long.\\n\\nI take my first bite and it tastes as it looks. Nothing exciting. But at the very least, it's filling and the gouda gives it a necessary kick. The spinach and tomatoes lighten it up a bit, but they don't do much to save the dish.\\n\\nI eat only half.

There are wonderful things on the menu that you just won't find anywhere else, and the red chili sauce is legendary.  When Terry and Larry (the owners) take a day off now and then, many of us go into a severe decline until they return and we can get back to wolfing down the green chile stew, or fresh crab enchiladas, or...well, I could go on and on.  The other nice thing:  you can go crazy and have a wonderful extravaganza of indulgent treats (chili cheese fries come to mind), or you can select a lighter or vegetarian option and you'll still feel like you had something special.

Seasoning is minimal (if my suspicions prove correct, there is probably no seasoning in the patty, just sirloin).

Always: lettuce, tomato, raw onion, mustard, mayo.  That's it.  Try it one day.  If you like it and want to go back, ruin it with a turducken on top or whatever.

Perhaps the eXtreme slowness is not their fault, although there is sometimes a we've-got-all-day attitude which does not help. The salt in the wounds is the following: (a) they are the only business left in the US I think which makes you sign paper credit card receipts, so after you've waited for your coffee so long you forgot what day it is, here they make you wait just a little bit more for no good reason, twisting the knife, for you to scribble an 'X' on a credit card reciept, and (b) they absolutely-insist-no-exceptions on obtaining your last initial in addition to your first name before taking your order, no matter how unusual your first name or how crowded the place, so you've got all these kids taking eons to prepare your order, wandering around in some kind of haze as if Taylorism had never happened, then insisting randomly on this pointless piece of protocol, as if their only service problem was people with the same first name getting mixed up about their order.

So that's what kept me in line.\\n\\nWhen a table opened up, we were shuffled in briskly by the no-nonsense hostess/waitress/part-owner of the restaurant. She's the type to hold a poker face, yet turned out to be the sweetest lady ever. We had about 1 minute to review the menu before we were asked to order. I felt the pressure. Even though this was a sit-down restaurant, it was more like \\"fast-food, sit down and eat as fast as you can to make room for the dozens of others standing outside in line and waiting for a table to open up\\".  I chose to get the salmon in lobster sauce fettucine dish, and it definitely didn't disappoint. \\n\\nOur food came promptly and was delicious as ever. I liked that we could actually see our food being made (and probably not by choice, but just because the restaurant was super small). TWe scarved down ourhe portions were immense. Two can totally share one dish, or one is guaranteed to have leftovers to savor the next day. \\n\\nFrom the time of sitting down to finishing our meal, it probably took a total of 30 minutes (super fast for restaurant standards, in my opinion). \\n\\nAlthough not an Italian fan, I would probably come back to this place.

It was a dangerous (but delicious!) ride home - I was actually wishing for red lights along the way.  \\n\\nLike everyone's said, the pizza is fantastic - superb flavor and texture.  The crust is probably my favorite part of the pizza - it might be the best thin pizza crust I have tasted.  It was pretty chewy and not cracker-y which is how I like thin crust.  The sauce on the margherita is great - it's just a simple, fresh sauce made from quality tomatoes like it should be.  The cheese is tasty and the garlic and basil definitely step it up.  I had my pizza drizzled with a bit of olive oil which was a nice touch as well.  One minor nitpick would be that the pizza I got was slightly undercooked - it was just a bit too soft right in the center and some of the cheese could have melted more.  \\n\\nEveryone's talked about how great the pizza is but the pastries here are a force to be reckoned with as well and shouldn't be passed up.  I had a sfogliatella and 2 cannoli (1 nuts/1 sprinkles).  The cannoli were very good - the ricotta filling was solid and the shells were nice and crisp with a hint of (cinnamon?) to them.  I had never had sfogliatelle before but was always curious about them when seeing them so it didn't take much convincing from Luca.  And he was right - these are amazing.  Lots of great textures (flaky, crunchy, chewy, slightly gooey?) and flavors (ricotta, orange, nut) going on in that pastry.  It was a great combination and the balance of flavors was fantastic - all the flavors worked subtly together and the whole thing wasn't too sweet.  I'm hooked.     \\n\\nAnyway, I was totally satisfied despite my high expectations.  It is definitely a couple notches above Varasano's and a notch above Fritti in my book.  I'm definitely going to be back soon.  \\n\\nForza Napoli!\\n\\n5"},{"name":"Dog Town Food Cart","address":"2880 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This weekend, I really wanted to try Dog Town Food Cart located at the Tidbit Food Farm and Garden in south east Portland. I've eaten plenty of hot dogs in my lifetime, but it will be the first time I've eat hot dog at a place where they've handcrafted their own hot dog, baked their own buns and cooked all the condiments and toppings from scratch! I really wanted to try their hot dog called the \\"Sonoran\\" which is a hot dog wrapped in bacon, refried beans and topped with salsa but I was disappointed to find they had already sold out even though I had arrived only about 30 minutes after opening (which is 5 PM). I decided I would try a dog named \\"Return of the Mac\\" which is a hot dog topped with homemade mac and cheese, bread crumbs and bacon bits. The homemade mac and cheese was made with a very mild cheddar or American cheese and would have made a delicious meal all on its own served in a bowl. Served on top of a hot dog it was really decadent and put it over the top! I really would have liked to have tried that \\"Sonoran\\", though so I will be back.

Because there were far more positives than negatives.\\n\\nWe looked at a fairly small menu and immediately it came to my notice that just about any cocktail is going to run you about double what a cocktail should cost. Straight up - it was in the $10.00 range for a cocktail. So we skipped that and went for straight tap water for free.\\n\\nThe menu had items on it for $13.95, and they sounded good, but a bit rich for our blood. We opted to go for the soup, half-sandwich and salad combos which had a nice bit of variety of choice.\\n\\nA very lovely and friendly waitress served us, we got the specials twice, once from her and once from the drink server who filled our water glasses. Very friendly staff.\\n\\nMy wife got the potato-watercress soup and half Shrimp Po'Boy sandwich with chipotle dressing.\\n\\nI got the Onion soup (it is redundant to call it \\"French Onion Soup\\" in a French restaurant) and the Croque monsieur sandwich which was basically a grilled-cheese and ham sandwich with dijon mustard.\\n\\nOk, I like shrimp, but I find it not the most flavourful of seafoods. But this sandwich was the tastiest and nicest shrimp dish I've had in some time. And the potato-watercress soup was heavenly. My wife immediately began deconstructing it so she could reconstruct it at home - she is a bit of a soup expert.\\n\\nMy own was the Onion soup - which I have had in hundreds of restaurants, and while this one was not an amazingly large step above others, it was a good onion soup. Totally fine. The simple sandwich, though, was quite another story. For such a simple thing one might expect a fairly bland deal. No sir. This was quite good. I loved every delectable bite. The dijon added to it more than I expected.\\n\\nMy wife thought the salad dressing on these fresh greens was a bit salty, but to me it was just about right, and the greens were a delight.\\n\\nThen it was cappuccinos and dessert. I had the cr√®me brul√©e with brandy-soaked cherries, and my wife had the chocolate mousse.\\n\\nI love cr√®me brul√©e and even enjoy making it from time to time - it gives me the chance to get out the blowtorch for a reason - and I have to say that this was excellent. I normally don't like cherries, but they added something to the dessert. It was delectable. My wife's chocolate mousse was too decadent - between the two of us, we could not finish it, and I usually do NOT normally leave anything chocolate on the table.\\n\\nThe coffee was also good.\\n\\nI even liked the music. We had Sinatra playing, some old standards, and for a while there, I really was transported to 1950s France.\\n\\nUntil I glanced towards the bars.\\n\\nOk, mini-rant coming up:\\n\\nThis IS Boston. I understand that. Home of the Patriots. Home of the Bruins. Home of the Red Sox. Home of the Revolution. Dammit, it's the home of some of the best sports teams in the world.\\n\\nBut can't you Bostonians leave your sports outside FOR AN HOUR??? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!?!?!\\n\\nStaring up at two HD TVs of Boston Bruins with what had otherwise until that moment amounted to very authentic French ambiance was like getting hit in the face with a cold, salted halibut!\\n\\nWHY??? Just shut off the damned TVs, Aquitaine!\\n\\nThe only other negative was the price.\\n\\nWhen I told some friends about our experience they asked about lunch prices on weekdays, and I can't speak to that, I'm not aware of what weekday lunch prices are. But if you go on a Saturday at lunch or for dinner, I say this: \\n\\nInject your wallet until it is bursting with wads of cash first, because let me be clear - this place is not cheap. For two of us for lunch where we had the soup-n-half-sandwich option, a normally economical lunch choice - and dessert and coffee, we paid as much as we normally pay for a dinner for us both AND our daughter.\\n\\nThe Yelp price range puts this at about 2 $s based on their guidelines, but be clear - it should be at least 3 $s, because this WAS lunch, not dinner we're talking about here.\\n\\nOur tab came out to be around $56.00. For lunch. A good lunch sure, but lunch. And of course we're healthy tippers, so it was nearly $70...\\n\\nOh... also, we were promised bread before the meal and no one brought any..."},{"name":"Westbury Farms Family Restaurant","address":"997 Boston Provdnce Tpke","city":"Norwood","stars":"3","text":"This is part of our 12 days of Second Breakfast and Westbury Farms also is filled with people over the age of 50 looking for a solid low-cost breakfast and lunch option.

I must say that this is my favorite place for wings in the whole freakin' world. This place puts B-Dubs and Hooters in the bottom of Awesome chain for sure. \\n\\nI came here between 3PM and 5PM with my family during a family vacation since I heard wings cost $.39 each which is a GREAT deal. It was located a street away from my hotel so getting there was easy. Upon arrival, we were brought to our booth promptly by the hostess. After being seated for a while and looking at the wing menu, our waitress came to take our orders. \\n\\nShe would be the reason for my review of this place being 5 stars if I reviewed this restaurant after my first time. However, my second time here made my overall review drop by one star which I will mention later in the review. \\n\\nOur waitress recommended which dry wings are great since I told her I preferred dry wings over wet wings. This is the ONLY restaurant I've been to that has a selection of dry wings and I told her this was the best restaurant since it accommodated my taste buds. After hearing that she high-fived me (if you are reading this missus waitress I really appreciate your service once again). When it came to ordering drinks I decided I'd have a pitcher of something good so asked her what was available on tap since it's not written on the menu. She said every beer that was available and we decided to other two pitchers throughout the night. \\n\\nThe wings were deep fried nice and brown while having a great crunch to it. The seasonings on the dry wings were great and tasty. The wet wings were covered in sauce nicely as well which you don't get at Hooters and B-Dubs most of the times since they seem to be stingy with their sauce. After doing our first initial order and eating it all we decided to order a few more and the second order was on the house! \\n\\nNow I will write about my less amazing experience here.. Since we decided to stay in Vancouver for a few days we decided to go back to Wings since we had an awesome stay the first time. Getting a table took a while even though no one was in front of us. I believe our waiter this time was the owner's son since he wore a dress shirt? It seemed like he didn't want to take his time to list the beers they had since I forgot what they offered. The wings were awesome as usual. However, the service wasn't great since he barely checked on the table and didn't fill up our water cups which would have been a nice touch... Too bad our previous waitress wasn't there the second time. \\n\\nThe 2-5PM deal is great for a light snack or early dinner so if you are free then come here!"},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"lesson 1 of the North End - get off Hanover Street ASAP\\nlesson 2 of the North End - weekday lunch is harder to find than you'd think\\nlesson 3 of the North End - Antico Forno\\nlesson 4 of the North End - lesson cancelled, teacher is having a post-food nap.\\n\\nAntico Forno lived up to expectations nicely.

Second, many of the dishes we ordered were really not good.  The calamari, both times, was super salty.  The ribbolita tastes like it came out of a can, and the bread in the soup looked like the tiny croutons you buy at the supermarket.  The risotto dish tasted metallic and was inedible.  And to boot, the prices aren't so inexpensive anymore.  The house wine is a mediocre $5 bottle of wine they sell for $27!  They have a good location and a good look, and it is working for them.

In fact it went above and beyond what I had remembered.  You know the story, no calling ahead, waiting in line outside.  Looking through the windows trying to see what meals looked good and who was almost done with their meal.  Making small talk to the people in line with us.  Table for 2?  Yes please.  Sit down.  Really nice waitress comes over, tells us without telling us that their calamari is the shit and we should probably get it.  Small order please and a bottle of red wine.   The wine list?  Oh the wine list is phenomenal.  One of every kind of wine.  All priced at 15.99.  My goal was to drink 2 bottles between the two of us.  We'll see how that turns out.  Order dinner, I got Scallops and Shrimp with Giacomo sauce, Sarah got Clams and Mussels with Giacomo sauce.  The specials looked really good, and next time I will be getting one of those, but they do seafood and I wanted seafood so I ordered seafood.  \\n\\nCalamari comes, wow it is good.  Best I've had in a long time.  Can we get extra marinara?  Of course!  When you go, just get the calamari.  don't play the whole 'trying to watch what I eat' game.  You'll be sending me comments to thank me.\\n\\nCalamari is gone, pasta's come quickly.  How much cheese do you want?  One scoop (for rookies), Two scoops (for the ladies) or three scoops for a man like me.  Dominated the pasta.  Actually couldn't finish is all but finished all the shrimps and scallops.  The second bottle of wine was nonsense.  What was I thinking.  Instead we said thank you, tipped big for being awesome, and walked off one of the best meals I've had in a while.\\n\\nIf you haven't been, you should probably go, it's one of those places with a lot of charm and FAN-TASTIC food\\n\\n5 stars!"},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was amazing with breakfast served all day!

The calamari was delivered very quickly and it tasted really good. However, it took FOREVER to get our entrees! I mean, we were well done with our appetizer and we still waited a good 20-25 min. to get our entree. My chicken picatta was terrible! Did not taste good at all. It was super bland and cold. I've definitely had better. My sister's chicken parm was good though. When it was time to pay I gave her my atlanta restaurant passport book and they automatically charged me 20% tip on the whole bill (before the discounted entree)- I know you're suppose to tip on the full bill. Our waitress was never around, in fact, the other waitress was the one giving us refills. So, it got me very very upset when they charged the 20% tip automatically just because I had the passport book. I usually leave 20% on full bill even if the service is bad because I know that's how they make their living but for them to impose on me how much I should leave as a tip? That's just NOT OK and RUDE! If the whole point on them being advertised on the atlanta restaurant passport book is to get more business, well they just lost mine.\\nNever going back.

We went early, to try and beat any rush and got to the restaurant shortly before it was scheduled to open.  The staff let us in those few minutes early because it was so bitterly cold outside, which we DEEPLY appreciated, and that only started off the great service we received.  \\n\\nFortunately, the early hour and cold meant that the restaurant wasn't very busy at the outset (though it was starting to get busy by the time we left), so I can't judge how it would all be during a rush, but our food was well made and delicious, the service was fast and attentive and enthusiastic (the waitstaff either really believe in the restaurant or they fake it well).  \\n\\nMy husband, who isn't a breakfast person, ordered the chicken strips, which he then took home for later. My dad and I had the Comfort Zone, an enormous, house-made biscuit, with \\"3 pigs\\" gravy, two eggs however you like them and bacon AND fried potatoes.  My stepfather had a collection of sides: eggs, bacon and the cheesy grits.  We also ordered beignets. \\n\\nThe biscuits on the Comfort Zone were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, but dense enough to hold up to the thickness of the gravy. I wasn't as impressed with the gravy as I wanted to be (it was VERY good, but it didn't taste especially different for having bacon, sausage and ham) but it was still delicious and eggs and bacon are hard to mess up.  They were cooked just as I wanted them and the whole glorious mess was delicious and filling.  The fried potatoes were fried potatoes and, though good, went mostly uneaten while I attacked the other stuff.  I thought the cheesy grits were a little runnier than *I* like it, but it was exactly as my stepfather likes them; he thought they were \\"too cheesy\\", I don't even understand what those words mean.  \\n\\nThe beignets tasted almost exactly as they should (which is like my mother's, thank you), but they were all fried shell, no doughy inside, which was weird...but delicious and just about perfect as a finish to the heavy breakfast I'd just had.  \\n\\nI ended up eating my husband's chicken strips the next day; they were still moist and tasty (if a little soggy after sweating it out in the styrofoam take out carrier) and the BBQ sauce that came with them was CRAZY good.

The waitress delivered another straw but failed to make any apology for the straw with the lipstick.  \\n\\nThe food was then delivered and it was average. When the bill arrived we were taken back by the price - the margarita was $12.  OMG - did we eat in El Tapatio or in the Ritz.  A Cadillac margarita at El Tapatio costs $12.  What happened?

It's like putting A-1 on a big thick ribeye steak or something.  It's really an insult to the cook.  \\n\\nThis place brings out their barbecue on a big plate and they put ribs, sausage and brisket- then they smother it with sauce! Before you even get to taste the meat or decide whether or not you want sauce on your meat, they force it upon you.  So it would seem they already know what they're serving you.  And they'd be right.  I am a bit of a barbecue-ologist or a grill master myself so I know what hard work and precision it takes to pull off some good food.  \\n\\nThe sausage was regular sausage, smoked and sliced.  The ribs had a thick crust on them.  The crust you get from basting it too much and then over cooking it.  A rib should have a nice thin char or crust and then juicy meat that falls off the bone. This was not a good rib.  None of them that we were served were good.  The brisket had a decent char to  it. It was flavorful on the outside, but the actual meat was a little tougher than it should have been.  The sides were lack luster.  Not even worth talking too much about.  \\n\\nBottom liine is that you have to drive way too far to get some overcooked meat that they try to pass off as barbecue...You want real texas barbecue, give me a hollar.

I thought the sauce could have used a little more kick and although the shrimp were very well cooked, they were a bit fishy and could have been fresher. My favorite part of the meal was actually the sides. My new love is moros and christianos. Never have black beans and rice tasted so good. Smoky, savory, porky heaven. Just try them and you will understand. The maduros (fried ripe plantains), tostones (fried green plantains) and yuca frita (fried yuca pronounced Yoo-ka) are all a great alternative to fries and I found myself eating mine, as well as my neighbors (what?

Although the salad bar price has gone up (from $10 to $12), it is still every bit worth its weight in gold.  Salad bar has too many toppings to name and a selection of steak, chicken or jumbo shrimp to include after your toppings.  Most of the toppings are consistently the same; however, from time to time, they do get switched up.  As you cruise through to the end of the salad bar, a dessert bar along with your choice of cornbread or rolls is set up.  Depending on the day of the week, the choice of dessert can be anything from peach cobbler to chocolate mousse.  You just can't beat this price for all all that you get.  In Midown?  This is unheard of!  I have to also mention that Jamarcus and Pete are two of the best waiters.

I've taken a couple of my friends here, and we've all enjoyed the smoothies ($5.75). The Moberi, Turtle Power, Uncle Jesse, and the DeLorean are all delicious. I find it hard to just narrow it down to one personal favorite. It honestly would depend on what I craved on that particular day.\\n\\nBut finally, I tackle the protein shakes! Each is $6 for a 16 oz. serving. Considering there's a gym next to the Rose City Food Park, it's a perfect spot for people to come by before or after a workout.

It's a green protein shake, pretty much the \\"Turtle Power\\" with hemp protein and apple juice added in.\\n\\nThe \\"Peanut Butter Cup\\" is also popular because, heck, it's got peanut butter and organic chocolate in there! Add a banana and some whey protein. Win.\\n\\nThe spicy panda prefers the \\"One Night in Bangkok.\\" Ryan admits it's a more adventurous option, but to me, it's a winning combination. Whey protein, peanut butter, banana, coconut milk, sesame oil, and sriracha. Yup, you read those last two ingredients correctly. You'll taste the peanut butter first, with the sesame oil and the spice of the sriracha hitting on the back end. It's an awesome combination, should you like the spicy and Thai flavors.\\n\\nThis protein shake got Ryan and I thinking about a possible spicy food video I could attempt. Basically, no one else should attempt what I do because I love testing insane heat levels and bizarre combinations.

While you're at it, check out the acai bowls and $2 shots. Ginger shot, anyone?\\n\\nPersonally, the protein shake earns this cart an elite rating.

Rarely one to question trusted palates in the cities I visit it was in fact the Beard Award (and particularly who he beat out) that forced me to reconsider my decision and after a week or so of watching the restaurant's social media feed I decided to give it a go.\\n\\nWith the room mostly heavy woods and brick plus some off white wallpaper juxtaposing the white tablecloths and quality service ware I actually liked the feel of Craigie save for one thing - the music which when combined with the open kitchen and room full of graduates, families, and parties was one of the loudest I've ever experienced.   \\n\\nSeated for approximately 5 minutes before Joseph, my captain for the evening, would arrive my water was filled (and kept nearly filled to the brim throughout) and a menu was delivered by a young woman.  With the menu divided into a la carte options, a six course, and a ten course I asked a few questions (largely to make sure that the main course was not beef and that a copy could be provided) and Joseph explained to me that the way the ten course worked was he would ask if there was anything I really liked and/or didn't want and the chef would craft it from there; thinking this sounded ideal and noting my likes and dislikes I opted for the ten course and things were underway.  With the two-top next to me notably requesting the six course (hard not to eavesdrop when everyone is yelling over the din of the room) and the table of six to my left opting for the ten course I will note that although the restaurant was busy service was quite good throughout and descriptions of each dish were detailed - but save for a couple of items it really didn't seem like the tasting was tailored at all.\\n\\nWith the room still loud but starting to fade as the hour approached 9:30 the check was delivered along with two small macarons described as \\"Chocolate Almond Tobacco\\" and although their dry texture was not ideal the flavor was certainly intriguing.  Also delivered with the check was a comment card, something I always take the time to fill out whether good or bad but especially in this case as it came with check-boxes a long note from Chef Maws requesting feedback.  Of course, since Joseph had also forgotten to pass along word of my desire for a printed menu I had a good fifteen minutes to fill out the card and as such became rather wordy - mostly praise but also noting that while some dishes shined others disappointed, especially in the setting of a \\"ten course menu\\" when four courses could have been served as amuses or palate cleansers rather than proper courses.\\n\\nHaving now been up for nearly twenty hours I settled my bill and with menu in hand I made my way to the door where my bags were gathered and within moments I found myself in a cab en route for the South End.  Having spent a good portion of the day eating I most certainly was not hungry, but at the same time I also wasn't terribly satisfied with my visit to Craigie on Main either.  Sure some of the courses were good - as a matter of fact, some were excellent - but for $150+ I tend to expect more from a Beard Award winning chef...and when I returned home to Ohio perhaps I found out just what I should have expected and received in the form of an apology and offer from Marjorie Maws stating \\"...of course we're upset that you weren't blown away by our food. Here's a possible explanation (but definitely not an excuse.). You came in at a time when there are lots of out of town visitors who are here for one of the many graduations in the area. We learned a few years ago that many of these diners were not as adventurous as our local crowd and so we made the menu a little more \\"normal\\" for a couple of weeks.

Inside, the decor is kind of like sitting in a retro kitchen, but with windows allowing diners to be a voyeur to the financiers parading by along Dartmouth en route to their mothership, Clery's -- overall, it's a casual vibe and a mixed crowd -- not rowdy or bro-ey, which gives it points in my book, given that I'm 80 at heart. Nevertheless, from what I've seen, you can expect to wait on a weekend night. \\n\\nPrices are reasonable -- I think cheeses are around $6-9 -- cocktails are $10 -- and meats are $7ish -- I'd say you can get out of here pretty full for $30ish/pp if you're not heavily boozing. \\n\\nUnless you're a committed pig enthusiast, perhaps not worth making a special trip over -- but, it's a nice casual spot with a friendly (and kind of adorable) bartender and tasty bites -- I'd hit it again."},{"name":"Umeda Japanese Cuisine","address":"1157 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I was excited to see a new sushi restaurant downtown and since we were too tired to keep walking in the rain, we decided to eat here.\\n\\nThe restaurant is fairly clean and new looking.

The servers weren't quick to help you and they kept forgetting things, but overall very friendly.\\n\\nWe ordered sushi rolls and the dinner for 2.  The sushi is average, but the cooked food wasn't very good.  The fried udon was too oily, didn't have enough taste and soggy.  The chicken karage was fried too long, and tasteless.  The tempera was edible and crispy except for the pumpkin piece.  The pumpkin needed to be cooked longer or at least wait for the vegetable to be more ripe before using.  My last issue was the ice cream that the dinner set came with.  It was mint and chocolate chip which by the way is my absolute least favorite flavor.  The ice cream tasted old because it had that powdery taste.  I asked for another flavor, but they said they ran out of everything.  I wish they would tell me before I ordered, but it's not a big deal.  (I walked down the street for dessert)\\n\\nThe prices are extremely well priced and it only cost $16 per person for 3 people.

Last visit, I didn't plan accordingly and was gobsmacked by the huge line for a table. I highly recommend trying to dine here earlier on a weeknight; on a Monday the throngs of tourists were noticeably absent and the wait for a table was only about 10 minutes. \\n\\nGiacomo's reminds me of a cross between two of my favorite Italian places back home; one a no-frills cash-only place with a chalkboard menu that specializes in the Italian staples, the other a tiny little space with amazing food and a selection of more creative dishes. \\n\\nPersonally, I would not recommend this place for a group of larger than 4-6 people. There are maybe 10 tables and everything is close quarters; the chef's table (for 2) is even wedged in corner at the bar. I also think you'll be disappointed if you come here for a romantic date or long lingering meal; they're always busy and turn the tables quite fast. I was in and out in no more than 40 minutes. \\n\\nMy server reminded me a lot of my late aunt; a no nonsense little Italian firecracker. Any question I asked her, she answered quickly and definitively like no other option existed. Fortunately, she didn't steer me wrong once. If you go in expecting your server to provide small talk and pleasantries, you may find the service curt or cold; not being one for idle chit chat, I liked it. For a place that's so busy, service is fast, efficient and attentive; everything runs like a well-oiled machine. \\n\\nIn hindsight, my only misstep was ordering the house salad; compared to the other starter options available, this is skippable. The dressing was good, but the big hunks of iceberg killed it for me. On the upside, the bread was quite good and useful for sopping some of the house dressing up off my plate. \\n\\nFor my meal, I ordered the linguine with mussels and clams in the Giacomo sauce, a lobster-based tomato sauce with a touch of bechamel. My meal was fabulous, I was so glad I was steered toward the Giacomo sauce over the fra diavolo. I received a mountain of linguine with a healthy portion of mussels and clams. Since I didn't have a way to store or reheat leftovers, I cleaned my plate; though there was a genuine concern that I might pop a button or bust a zipper - it totally would have been worth it. \\n\\nGiacomo's offers not only great food, but great value for the money. My tab was $25 for a glass of wine, salad and entree. The next time I'm back in Boston, this is on my short list of places I need to return. \\n\\n*That's what happens when your job regularly sends you to hotspots like Fort Wayne, IN. \\n\\nTIP: Try the Fra-Como sauce - it's amazing!\\n\\nTIP: There's an ATM directly across from the restaurant."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The place is ok.

My parents have spent significant portions of their life living in Korea, and I fell in love with KoreanBBQ after many gorgings in Koreatown, LA.  So when we passed this whilst looking for parking in Coolidge corner scouring the addresses for a highly recommended Thai place, we opted in. \\n\\nFeaturing a decor that exists in countless Japanese / Korean restaurants across the globe (light woods, rice paper paintings and screens) the restaurant sits beneath a plain blue awning on the corner of Beacon and Centre just west of Coolidge Corner. \\n\\nYasu wasn't exactly what I remembered Korean BBQ to be, but was none the less good. \\n\\nFor the novice, Korean BBQ consists of a platter of meats and veggies being dumped onto a built-in electric griddle in the middle of the table. I found the rectangular grills at Yasu small compared to some of the large, circular grills I have seen before, but this size was perfect for four people. The BBQ combination, an assortment of spiced pork, chicken and Bulgoki (lean steak) as well as mushrooms, onions and peppers are arranged on the grill by a server. You are also provided with assorted Korean sides, many of them being pickled vegetables, the most note worthy of which is outstanding Kim chi (chili pickled cabbage), and white rice.\\n\\nWhile everything was good, I was expecting more kick from the marinated meats;  Korean meats often have a rich garlicky, gingery, scalliony flavor that these lacked. Also, the sides were so small and slow in being replenished and they are critical to the success of the Korean 'Q experience. \\n\\nAt a price point of $25/per person, this is hardly cheap but is fair given the portions, and although I enjoyed the experience, I think Ill give another Korean BBQ place a shot before returning here."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Being a huge fan of Italian food, I can honestly say that Giacomo's is the best in town.

Skip the long, narrow dining room and ask for a seat on the enclosed patio.

He's only my friend though, no big deal. *eye roll* Needless to say it was hard to enjoy my meal with him pacing behind me, I wanted him to be able to sit down and not be sweating to death due to the fire-breathing pizza ovens 10 feet away but whatever, this is Antico and we are all just supposed to be thankful to be eating this food, right? Sure... Needless to say it's loud in there, too.\\n\\nI think that Ammazza is just as good as they have noticeable air conditioning and better drink selections and 2 locations in O4W and Edgewood (I like O4W's space better myself). Save your money, people, unless you just *have* to find out how hot it is in Antico for yourself, and go to Ammazza instead. Oh yeah, and parking is obnoxious for Antico and there was an Atlanta police officer out front in the middle of Hemphill directing traffic around the joint because it was so damn busy at 8p on a Friday. So yeah, have fun with that.

The hostess said it would probably be a bit of a wait, but when I told her we just wanted a quick drink she found a table for us (the table had a later reservation which is why she didn't want to give it to us if we were going to have a full dinner).

I came here this week on a Wednesday night to catch up with an old friend. The overall experience was good but I had expected more. I will list out everything that we ordered and will explain in detail.\\n\\nAhi Tuna Tower - excellent.. delicious and exactly what I expected.\\n\\nOnion pancake - the pancake was crispy and flakey but a little too greasy. Also the sauce was too sweet. I'm used to the basic soy sauce or picked jalape√±o and not a super sweet sauce.\\n\\nBerkshire pork belly buns - they were good but a little too sweet and super salty\\n\\nSzechuan Cold Noodles - it was good but not what I expected. It has a peanut sauce and after mixing the noddles, they started to taste very gummy and starchy. Also the server couldn't explain to us what was in the noodles so we were playing roulette here. \\n\\nPork Dumplings (steamed) - I was really disappointed in this dish. I don't know if the wrapper was over cooked but as soon as we picked them up with our chopsticks, the filling immediately fell out and was left eating the peel and filling separately. \\n\\nWe ordered the jellyfish salad but they were out. Also ordered stir-fried Chinese broccoli but the waitress brought us bok choy. When asked about the vegetable, she argued that the chef said it was chinese broccoli but then later admitted she had no idea of the difference. Instead of arguing what she had brought to the table, she could have handled it by taking it away and asking the chef in the back what kind of vegetable it was. We ended up not ordering any veggies as it would have been another gamble of what would come out.\\n\\nOverall the experience was ok. I've traveled numerous times to Asia (Korean, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand) and had their authentic street food so I was super excited to try this place out but they missed the mark. The staff was extremely friendly and had no issues with our server. I just wish the food was more authentic and less geared towards an American pallet.\\n\\nIt was also confusing to find the place. When I drove up, I saw the Chinatown name on the side of the building but my GPS told me I was at Street. When you walk to the front, it says Street so that was very confusing. Even when we walked in, they asked \\"Are you here for Street or Chinatown?\\" With confused looks on our face, we had to ask them the difference. I noticed that happened a lot with other customers walking in. I think if they had asked if we had  been here before, answer no, then tell them there are two restaurants and which one were they here for. Obviously, after your first visit you understand there are two restaurants in one building and an explanation is not needed if they answer yes. \\n\\nI would try this place out again but stick to their sushi."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but because of the hostess with the nasty, nasty, nasty attitude, this rating is just 3 stars.

I was told that this place had excellent BBQ and had places for my kids to roam and explore.  We ended up going on Father's Day to check it out.  I can't really comment on the business of the place and lack of seating because this will happen no matter where you go.  What was nice was that they had fresh lemonade to buy and other things while you wait if you needed a small bite.  There was even live music and I bought the band's CD but unfortunately, none of the music they played was on the CD.  So that's great.  Still, not judging SL for that.\\n\\nWe were able to get a table fairly fast for  the wait.  I want to say we waited 45 min which can be the wait for even a Sunday lunch some place.  The options were to either buy a plate of unlimited limited bbq or buy a single plate of some sort.  So, since we have little kids, I decided to buy the unlimited limited plate, as I call it because I didn't want to get my own plate and my kids raid it and I'm left with nothing.  I really wanted pork ribs, being more tender that beef ribs but that wasn't an option.  I ended up with just sausage, brisket and maybe 2 beef ribs.  The waitress was excellent, she kept our glasses full and when she wasn't around, she had others drop off our plates.  No problem there.  When my kids got bored, my husband was able to take them right outside where I could see them through the ceiling to floor windows.  I was really just disappointed in the flavor.  THERE IS NO SEASONING.  I mean, seriously, none.  Basically, they threw mean in the smoker, probably relied on some wood to flavor it and then served it.  The most flavor I got was the desserts.  Those were good.  I love a berry pie and you get lots of it but sheesh.  If you're going to run a bbq joint, add seasoning.  It's like visiting an old friend and they invite you over and boast about having this amazing food people ask for often and once you take a bite, you are let down because the hype was so big.  Fortunately, they have a house full of toys like a pool table, darts and bounce house for kids but you're still hating it.  \\n\\nMy guess is that people go here because it's a large restaurant with acreage and places for the kids to play.  It's perfect for corporate parties and gives you the big Texas bbq feel but lets you down.\\n\\nThough Rudy's is small and doesn't offer more than a table to sit at, they have amazing flavor on their meats and a good sauce.  Also, my husband got food poisoning at the Salt Lick at the airport and so did a friend who went on a different day.  They seem to not know how to do breakfast.  \\n\\nGo back?  Nah!  They can keep it.  For the price, you get lots of food but if I'm going to get lots of food, it better amaze my taste buds and this did not.  It lacketh good flavor and the ability to produce breakfast without food poisoning.

I was pleasantly surprised to find Salt Lick all grown up, but still sporting the wooden fence posts and dirt parking lot from my childhood.\\n\\nAnyway, enough self-indulgent drivel. The pit is glorious, the 'Q is head and shoulders above most BBQ joints in TX.

Order the Baby Backs (Sunday only), Pork ribs, and sausage, in that order.\\n\\nThe Pork ribs almost went toe-to-toe with Black's, but lacked that intensely smokey flavor, instead relying on a surprisingly good vinegar based sauce. Sausage was delicious without being overly greasy, it had that just right \\"pop\\" of the sausage casing as you bite in. Yum! Things went off the rails when the brisket came out, unfortunately. Despite a smoke ring thicker than most Biggest Loser contestants, the brisket was almost as tasteless as the show. \\n\\nWe finished up with the cobbler, which probably dragged the review down a bit. Though it looked heavenly, the cobbler lacked any sort of crust, and thus, any sort of texture. As the ice cream began to melt in the 80 degree heat, our cobbler quickly devolved into a soupy sugar bomb mess. Like a real American hero, I ate it anyway, though I was quite displeased at the $6 price tag.\\n\\nSalt Lick is one of those Austin institutions that has matured gracefully. The real BBQ pedigree keeps it from becoming an \\"out-of-towner, once a year\\" affair, and elevates it as a genuine BBQ competitor.

I feel like it is my duty, as a San Francisco dining professional, to let everyone know what Thai food is supposed to taste like. :]\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed the bold flavors and textures of the Thai dishes that I ordered from Lime Leaf. The Lime Leaf Triangle appetizer is a new dish that I've never tried at any Thai restaurant before, and it is a MUST-TRY if you love fried things, as I shamelessly do. The filling was succulent and, overall, it was light, non-greasy, and put Gyoza (potstickers) to shame! I also loved the Tom Khar coconut soup. Mmmm... what a comforting treat to sip slowly on a cold, winter's day. It seriously made me question why I ever hated coconut when I was a kid. Clearly, I was deluded.\\n\\nOnto the main course: my boyfriend and I received a generous serving of Thai Fried Rice, with many big pieces of shrimp and chicken, and my new favorite, Crispy Chicken Basil! No words can describe how much I enjoyed the Crispy Chicken Basil-- JUST ORDER IT. I normally just eat until I am no longer hungry, but on that particular evening, I ate until I had difficulty breathing. It was that good. Of course, I had to order the Fried Ice Cream because, well... it's fried. Duh. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Lime Leaf doesn't serve the panko-breaded tempura fried ice cream that they typically serve in Japanese restaurants. This one consisted of coconut ice cream lovingly engulfed by a mysteriously rich, spherical shell of fried, hot dough, drizzled with chocolate syrup and topped with whipped cream, a cherry, and rainbow sprinkles. The fatty in me was crying to order more, but I firmly shut her up. It was for our own good.\\n\\nLiving in JP won't stop me from happily driving back to Weymouth over and over again for some more Lime Leaf goodness.\\n\\nAnd you definitely should, too.\\n\\n\\n(Oh, yeah, and the service was courteous, prompt, and attentive.)  Lime Leaf is fully awesome."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Not always worth the wait, and extremely noisy.

Alas, I was greeted by another person who then took me to a rustic picnic bench type table. As I sat looking around the room at other patrons, I noticed that all the plates looked all the same. Homogenized, almost plastic and reminded me of my time in Japan where there are silicone plastic models of what your food is going to look like - replicas of the restaurant's actual food.  \\n\\nTHE SELECTION \\nI ordered beef brisket and ribs with beans, potato salad, and bread on the plate. My mouth was watering with the anticipation that I would receive some amazing food. After all, the reviews on here and in travel guides seem to make Salt Lick food amazing. \\n\\nPRESENTATION\\nWhen my food came out, it looked exactly like all of the other plates around - very homogenized as if it came from an assembly line. The potato salad was a lump of white stuff that looked like a baby iceberg, the beans (swimming in juice) were strangely red in color, and the ribs and brisket looked dull - absolutely no shine or sheen at all. Where were the succulent juices that were supposed to be oozing from the meat??? Not on my plate.\\n\\nFOOD AND TASTE (ROUND ONE)\\n\\nBEANS - cold in temperature and tasted like Ranch Style Brand beans in a can - the exact taste to be exact. It is as if a can of beans were opened and dumped directly on my plate. \\n\\nPOTATO SALAD - room temperature and had an interesting flavor. I've not ever tasted potato salad like this before . . . not sure if it is a bad thing or a good thing. \\n\\nRIBS - lukewarm and a little tough. I felt like I was eating yesterday's ribs that had been reheated in a microwave, as they were a bit tough and chewy. There were no juices and the meat was hard to get off the bone.\\n\\nBRISKET - cold and tasteless. Eating my shoe would have provided more flavor than this crap. I can now understand why the waitress offered sauce to go with the brisket. Blech.\\n\\nBREAD - warm and soft but not homemade. \\n\\nI've never been one to complain to a waitress about food before; however, I simply could not choke down this horrible food. I complained twice - when I begin to eat the ribs and when I was eating the brisket. The waitress was cool with me and brought out fresh meat.\\n\\nFOOD AND TASTE (ROUND TWO)\\n\\nRIBS - these hit the mark, spot on! These ribs were piping hot and so tender that they were falling off the bone. I wished my first had have tasted so good!\\n\\nBRISKET - perfecto! The brisket was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it and the flavor was succulent and juicy.\\n\\n\\nA couple of other things happened that warranted the two stars. A male employee with a ponytail stopped by to ask how my visit was and I tactfully told him about my experience. He said that my experience never normally happens but didn't show a huge concern in making it right. While I was eating, I overheard another patron complain to her waiter that the food was burnt. Seems as though Ponytail Man was wrong, a bad dining experience happened twice in the same day and in the same hour. Perhaps most people don't bother complaining, rather they eat what is put in front of them out of complacency. The second thing that happened was paying for the bill - this place doesn't accept credit cards. Cash only. It would have been nice if there was a sign somewhere that said so.\\n\\nAfter speaking with the waitress, she expressed her concerns and stated that after the Food Network came to visit, the barbecue was never consistent, that it was hit-or-miss and everything has become an assembly line. She further stated that most people that come into the restaurant are only there because they saw it on TV.\\n\\nOverall, my dining experience at Salt Lick lacked that wow factor and I will definitely NOT be recommending this place. There are better places in Texas - heck, Rudy's is better than this place!"},{"name":"Food Truck Village","address":"901-963 SW Alder St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food truck Village is a great experience.

We shared both of the entr√©es and they were amazing.\\n\\nThe pineapple fried rice was the best I've ever had I think the name of the truck was NAMU and the waffle came from the Smwaffler. Service was fast, friendly, easy to maneuver around the court. They had tables and awning set up to keep you out of the shade and or rain.

My friend and I tried the small Fried Calamari app, Butternut Squash Ravioli, and 1/2 lobster, mussels & clams over linguini with giacomo sauce.  The calamari was one of the best I've had with exceptional tenderness and just the right about of batter.  The linguini and seafood tasted fresh and perfectly-cooked (it's actually pretty amazing how easily Italian restaurants can overcook pasta...).  As for their renowned ravioli, it was delicious and the sweet finish to each piece was a great change of pace from the usual cheese and/or meat ravioli.\\n\\nThe interior was surprisingly tiny in person even after seeing all the reviews noting the small space.  The staff make the most of the limited square footage though and our server did a very nice job providing a quick run-down of the wall menus, taking orders, refilling water, and helping to arrange the entrees/providing extra plates for easy sharing.

When I saw that the old Houlihan's location was being renovated and a new Miller's Ale House was moving in, it made my day. So when I was recently doing some Christmas shopping, I had to to stop in for lunch.\\nThe layout of the dining area and lounge appears to have more room than the previous Houlihan's. As much as I liked the former establishment at this location, the dining area and lounge seemed rather cramped. Miller's Ale House has more room to it, and is also well lit. Not as dark as was Houlihan's, due to the soft lighting throughout. There is also a patio with table service and full bar, which makes it nice to sit out on a cool evening. There are televisions throughout, so it is difficult to miss any of the sports action being televised.\\nI was greeted immediately, and chose to sit at the bar. The bartenders, Holly and Val, greeted me and went over any specials they had for the day. Although both bartenders were busy, both served their guests in a friendly and timely manner. While I was waiting for my meal, I spoke to a hostess who was also quite courteous and recommended the special for the day, a Chicken Parmesan sandwich. It sounds like it would be a great sandwich, but I always order the Big Red sandwich. That is a deep fried chicken breast covered in buffalo wing sauce and mozzarella cheese. Served with french fries ($8.99) My order came out in good time, and both the sandwich and fries were hot. Maybe next time I will take her up on that Chicken Parmesan.\\nThe beer selection is a great one! There must be at least 25-30 different beers on draft. Having arrived during Happy Hour, pints of Bud Light were $2.50. I also tried a pint of Tomoka Oceanside IPA, which is brewed in Ormond Beach, Florida, by Tomoka Brewing. If you like a good IPA, this one is worth trying. And as I mentioned, a full liquor bar is available.\\nLike all of the Miller Ale House locations, their menu offers the same fare. Including those Zingers, the chicken tenders covered in sauce that a friend of mine is crazy about! And if you are of fan of chicken wings, Miller's has several sauces and levels of heat to choose from.\\nLocated in the Colonial Plaza Marketplace on Colonial Drive and Bumby, this makes for a great place to go if you are shopping here or at Fashion Square Mall. If you are a sports fan, most likely your game is televised here. And if you are not, it's a great place to go for good food and drink in a casual setting.\\nPlus it is convenient to the residents in the Colonialtown and Dover Shores neighborhoods. And driving here for me is no problem. As much as I love the Miller's Ale House on Semoran Blvd., driving on State Road 436 is not something I love to do. Any time I am driving on Semoran Blvd., I feel like I am a stunt driver in a action movie. No worries driving to this new location! \\nShortly after writing this review, I stopped in here on Saturday afternoon to catch up some on some college football bowl games and have lunch. I ordered the build your own burger cooked medium with provolone cheese, lettuce, and tomato ($8.79). The cheeseburger, which is a one-half pound hamburger pattie, was cooked just the way I like it. And both my cheeseburger and french fries were served immediately from the kitchen. No cold food here! And a shout out to Carlos and Chelly! Both greeted me as I entered, and both provided great service during my visit. They are two reasons why I will most likely be back again."},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The salmon I ordered was very good.

I asked for avacado to be added and that helped, but the dish really lacked any depth. Cilantro would have been nice or even a mild pepper for a little heat. Also disappointing, was the fact that there was no shrimp in the shrimp sauce.\\nMy sis had the Maple grilled salmon salad with field greens, sweet potato chips and a Key lime vinaigrette. So so boring. Again, it was like there was a layer of missing flavor. It tasted quite like one of those \\"gourmet\\" salads you end up grabbing on the run at the airport. \\nI did, however, enjoy the soup de jour, which was a roasted pepper bisque. It was creamy and full of flavor. My sister had the chicken tortilla soup, which had a great broth, but the chunks of chicken were a little too big making it a very hands on soup. \\nI won't say I won't return as the patio seating and wine list make it a great spot for summer sipping.

The sides are solid, and if you go family style (and who doesn't?) it's all-you-can-eat, which is what my out-of-town friends want when they can get their annual BBQ fix. Even better, there's the nice yard area with live music while you wait, it's BYOB, and you can sit outside and bring the dog.

The 5 of us arrived around 8:30pm on Saturday night. We ordered drinks: 2 of the 5 beers were not available and the drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive. Ok, we'll let that slide. \\n\\nWhen ordering food we were told they were out of ALL 3 of the salads on the menu. At 9pm on a Saturday night?? Ok, fine. So we ordered 3 appetizers and 4 entrees. \\nThe first of the appetizers arrived 30 minutes later and our entrees arrived OVER AN HOUR later. The wait was absurd especially considering there were open tables in the restaurant. My boyfriend took a look in the kitchen at one point and said it looked like a bomb was dropped and only one guy was cooking.\\n\\n(This might also be a good time to mention that one of the bathroom toilets was overflowing. It was worse than I've seen in the dirtiest dive bar. Gross).\\n\\nI understand if the place is understaffed but the waitresses made zero attempt to explain what was going on and when we complained after an hour passed that we hadn't seen our food there was no apologies or any real response as to why it was taking so long.\\n\\nWhen the food did arrive the skewers of filet mignon were terribly overcooked and there were only 4 small pieces of meat with about 8 yucca fries sprinkled on top. That's for $16, by the way. This should not be an entree; it should be a $10 appetizer.\\n\\nThe Mafe did not have enough lamb in it but the Yassa Guinaar\\n(marinated grilled chicken with jasmine rice) was decent. Since there are no vegetables in any of these dishes one would like to have a salad with them, but as I mentioned before, there were no salads to be had. We were still so hungry after eating our food we ordered a large pizza from Laz Cafe next door. I am not kidding.\\n\\nOh and one more thing, we were seated by the door of the restaurant which does not close properly. My boyfriend and guy friend had to lean over and shut the door fully every time people walked in and out of the restaurant (maybe 20 times throughout the meal). The waitresses were very aware of this but did not seem to care. We were laughing about it for the first 30 min but after waiting so long for mediocre food it started to seem less funny.\\n\\nDespite my one star rating, I'd be willing to try this place again if Teranga can get its act together.

My eggs were served exactly as I ordered them which has been proven difficult at a lot of restaurants: scrambled hard. The only thing I can think of that I didn't like as much as everything else was the bacon. It tasted like bacon, but there was an undertone of flavor. It was a little like some sort of rubber.

The last few months the quality has gone down A LOT. Their bread is always rock hard, 2 of the male drivers I get forget parts of my order half of the time, and it takes way longer than it should most times to go a few blocks. I dealt with all that as it delivered and not much in Tigard delivers, however they are now charging a delivery fee on top of price and tip. I always give me drivers at least 1 20% tip on the online order and if they get to me fast I give them a few extra dollars cash. With the added delivery fee this makes it one of the more expensive sandwich places in the area now. I can get Firehouse Subs for $4-5 less and better sandwiches. With the added cost I can get grubhub or postmates for close to the same price as JJ's now. Or for around the same price get Panera delivered.  Our office used to order from here several times a week. Now we rarely do, with the added delivery fee I don't think anyone will. Today one person took sandwich orders for the staff and went to grab them at Firehouse. There are so many sandwich shops near here for mediocre food I don't know who would drive there and with as expensive as delivery is now it lost it's one saving grace. If I want a sandwich I guess it will be Firehouse, Subway, Togos, Potbelly, Elephants, Jersey Mike's, Beaverton Sub Station, Which Which, or Big Town Hero as all of them are a 5-10 min drive from the mall area with better food.

Stiff, cheap drinks; free pool; friendly bartenders; great patrons; good music - it had it all. It still has a lot of these things.\\n\\nBut there seems to be a new kind of crowd coming in nowadays for various shows and such. I don't know if these shows were always happening and I just never noticed or if they're a newer thing - either way, made the mistake of showing up for a casual, low-key night of hanging out at one of my favorite bars on the same night as one of these shows. It's not that the band was bad - they were alright. But they pushed back the pool tables to make room for the band so no one could play anymore, they closed off one of the doors and had people walk around the side, thereby also making it near impossible to play foosball since it meant you would partially block that walkway, and the place got more crowded than I've ever seen it - great for business I'm sure, but not so great for a regular. We waited 20 minutes just to close our tab. It was horrible.\\n\\nSo, my advice? Go there, it's great, you'll really enjoy it. But if you're like me, and you prefer a more casual atmosphere where you can actually talk to the people you're with and hear them talking to you, and if you want to be able to play pool - just don't go when there's a show. In fact, the weekends in general are a time to avoid. Except Sunday nights, which are awesomely low-key. \\n\\nTwo last things.

I wish I could remember his name! They have been running a special for unlimited pasta bowls, which is what my husband and I both got. Their garlic parmesan sauce is really good! And as always, their salads, soup, and breadsticks were good as well.\\nI know we'll be back - Olive garden is one of my favorite restaurants.

The atmosphere of the place is immediately cool, and the smell of the smoke was incredible.  We came on a Tuesday night, and there was no wait to get in.  Upon being seated, my friend recommended the Beef Ribs.  They were pricey at about $24, but I figured my friend probably knew what he was talking about.  \\n\\nI then noticed some wording on the menu that caught my attention....\\"cash only.\\"  HUH?  In 2015, cash only?  So we were naturally worried as neither one of us brought cash.  Thankfully, there is an ATM on premise.  \\nWe also asked for our check to be split and the waitress informed us that she couldn't split checks.  Once again, huh???\\n\\nAnyways, back to the meal.......the meat was absolutely incredible.  Tender......smokey.....nice bits of char.  The meal came with sides of baked beans and potato salad.  I am not a huge fan of potato salad, but this stuff was pretty good.  The baked beans were very thin and lackluster.  But the incredible flavor of the beef ribs made up for the sides.  All and all an awesome BBQ joint.  The quality and flavor of the meat certainly blew away the stuff I'm used to getting in Memphis....even though we have some damn fine bbq here as well!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Nice decor, great service and yummy food.

Love all the dishes here. I've probably tried around 10 dishes, but I've kind of forgotten the names :( But I do have my main go to dishes. \\n\\nParking - Uhh.... yeah, 1 major con for Little Bangkok. Parking really sucks. There are VERY few parking spots out front. But after 6PM you can park in lots across from them. There are directions as to where. I forgot what the shops' names were. \\n\\nSpace - I would say medium. There are several booths & tables, but beware: during lunch/dinner rush, you will be waiting. The waiting area is TINY. So yep, come early or come late. \\n\\nService - I've never had bad service here. Been here like 10x and I honestly can't remember a single bad time. The servers here are super fast & get stuff done ASAP. Other servers check in as well when they can tell a table is wanting to order, done with their dishes, or want the check. \\n\\nEnvironment - Buzzing. A louder crowd for sure. But definitely a good thing. :) \\n\\nFood - \\nI've always gotten rice on the side... not sure if it's complimentary? My bf and I usually order a Fried Rice & noodle/chicken dish...Not complaining about the side rice though!! \\n\\nTheir coconut soup is pretty good. It's also given in a nice sized bowl. Not THE best coconut soup, but one of the best ones I've had in Atlanta. I get this as an app every time :D A great remedy for a cold night. So delicious. \\n\\nFried Spring Rolls - Whoa, they are huge. If you're with 4 people, order this as an app and cut the 2 rolls into 4. Love the rolls here! Usually it's just me and my bf, so.... we get a little full after eating them. The taste and crunchiness are solid. \\n\\nPad Thai - So I personally love their Pad Thai here. Done perfectly for me. Maybe I got it on the days the chef had a good day? I recommend getting this if you enjoy Pad Thai in general. Other thai places I've gone to can't compare to Little Bangkok's. This is shareable.  \\n\\nPenang Curry - the are SO many greens in this dish. Not enough chicken, BUT I'll eat sauced greens over chicken any day of the week. Nom Nom. The sauce is also tasty & compliments the chicken and greens. The portions are nice too. \\n\\nPS their Chili Hot Sauce will set your mouth on fire.

But here in Atlanta, we don't have many, so the few that can make a taco with a corn tortilla get noticed. \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you'll be impressed with the environment. Sunny and industrial, it hits all of the right notes for hipness. It's on Highland, which is cool for people watching -- although when we went it was dominated by office types and high school kids. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good. Servers were friendly and had a hip edge.  They sell Coronas and Jarritos and look to have a decent bar. Salsa was good and the chips were excellent. So how can you go wrong?\\n\\nIt's like the food here is scared to be what it should. It's as if they know what flavors should be in the tacos and have decided to hide them from their patrons for fear that they will find them to be too much. And so they hold back on the flavors and Americanize the food. In so doing, they de-elevate it and swerve towards Applebees in a way that the cool hip ambience and staff don't help you predict.\\n\\nI ordered two Carne Asada tacos. First, that duo cost $10. So already that's a shock. The same things regularly sell for $2 top -- and even that's pushing it. The corn tortilla is meh nothing special. They've got this steak inside which was charred a bit, but tasted exactly like steak, except that if you have Carne Asada in mind, you are not going to want Applebee's fajita strip steak diced up inside a corn tortilla. Add that to the Spartan use of cilantro and onion and we have a taco that doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste great. You won't leave there angry, but you won't leave there super excited about telling others -- particularly those in the know -- about your find.  \\n\\nSo if you're looking for a spot that probably has a fun bar and serves some Mexican food, this isn't bad.

That was the first part of the experience. Top down, rolling ranches, and sundown. When we arrived, the location took my breath away. It was something out of a Nicholas Sparks southern movie. While we waited for our table, we sat outside near a fire pit and drank wine that we brought with us (that's a huge plus, this place is BYOB..and if you didn't know or forgot, they have a place where you can buy). \\n\\nAfter about 20 minutes we were called to our table inside, where a lovely waiter explained our menu to us. We were a party of 10, and about half of us got the \\"all you can eat\\" option for 25 dollars. It was very nice that they allowed for only five of us to do that, because I've been to restaurants that require every person in the party to participate in \\"all you can eat\\" deals (in fear of people trying to cheat the system). But this waiter was very accommodating and understanding. This was perfect because those of us with a smaller appetite could order a small dish, but still try a piece or two off of the plates of the guys that ordered \\"all you could eat\\".\\n\\nThe food itself was hands down the BEST BBQ I have ever had. The chicken was moist and sweet, and the sausage was absolutely to die for. It was served with beans, potato and cole slaw...all cooked and spiced perfectly. One of the best parts of the meal may have been the potato bread that came along with it (so you could make sandwiches). We refilled our plates about 5 times each and left in nothing short of a food coma. No regrets.\\n\\nThe only two things to really be aware of: 1) the wait outside can get chilly at night, so bring a jacket and 2) this place is CASH ONLY and DOES NOT SPLIT CHECKS.

This is a tragic, but increasing common disorder in which an establishment simultaneously possesses more than one personality.\\nIn the case of Trident, it cannot quite figure out if it wants to be a restaurant or a bookstore. As such, it doesn't really do a very good job at being either.\\n\\nBeginning with the bookstore personality, the first thing you'll notice is that it is incredibly small. This wouldn't be a problem if they specialized in a particular subject or if they stocked rare books that you cannot find anywhere else, but unfortunately they do not. Trident is more akin to one of those Huntington News stands you find in the airport than a big-box bookstore like Barns & Noble. It is filled with magazines and pop-literature that everyone will forget about 3 weeks from now.\\n\\nThe cafe personality is little better. When I met some friends for breakfast, we waited an hour and a half, most of the time outside, just to sit down. The place was very busy, which is partially due to their lack of seating (pesky bookshelves get in the way). Thankfully, the meals were delivered promptly, but my friend's order was slightly off. Our waitress paid little attention to us, which was not really her fault considering the number of tables she was waiting on, but nevertheless was frustrating. Finally, as soon as we were finished, we were quickly ushered out the door to make room for the next patrons.\\n\\nNow, I understand the pressure small businesses like Trident feel when trying to compete with large corporations like B&N and Amazon.com, but the answer is to get smaller, not bigger. Simply offering more \\"stuff\\" makes them more similar to their competition and less attractive to consumers. If you want to be a great cafe, reduce the number of bookshelves/magazine stands, increase the seating and hire more waitstaff. If you want to be a great bookstore, get a better book selection (stock \\"Shades Of Gray\\", not \\"50 Shades Of Gray\\"), maybe stop offering full meal service, and restrict the amount of seating (outdoor only maybe?).\\n\\nThat is all I have to say."},{"name":"Super Burrito Express","address":"10506 SE 42nd Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"3.5","text":"great food been coming here for years hast changed since then always a satisfied customer"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Make the trip out to driftwood.

The drinks and food are very flavorful and complex and each bite is an explosion of herbs!  The owner and waitress were exceptionally nice and friendly and the ambiance unique and soothing.\\n\\nThe bouye drink is a must!!  It's made from the fruit of the baobab tree and tastes like a light lassi.  I think it has cream in it, but it's certainly a worthwhile indulgence!!  The drink was so interesting and unique that I followed it up with the Ginger juice, which was equally amazing (and lighter)!.\\n\\nThe appetizer portions are relatively small but shareable as most orders come with 3 pieces.  I recommend the accara (like a friend dough but made with black eyed peas), fataya (almost like a samosa), and nems (spring rolls due to the Vietnamese influence in Dakar), and the sauce that comes with them is delectable.    \\n\\nFor entrees, I had the Dibi - grilled lamb shoulder chop with pickled onions slathered in mustard sauce.  Oh my goodness - the seasoning was just perfect.  Full of flavor yet not too overbearing.  The onions added just the right amount of tanginess and mustardy taste that offset the salt in the lamb.  The sweet potato fries that came on the side were the right balance of crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\\n\\nMy friend had the Michoui, which was also spectacular.  You could practically see the lamb hanging onto the bone by a thread.  Another friend ordered the Mafe, which was also stewed to perfection.\\n\\nAll in all, a terrific place!  We even got some cake at the end as the owner was celebrating an event with the staff.

(Though just to put it out there first, the service is fantastic. They treated us wonderfully. This is a review of the food and the environment.)\\n\\nThere are about three different ways I can think to review Craigie.  \\n\\n1. Is it worth 350 dollars for a dinner for two?    -- Maybe\\n2. Is it the best restaurant to spend 350 dollars for dinner for two?  -- Probably not, I think there are better ones. But its worth it for novelties sake.\\n3. How does it compare to other restaurants I've been to:   It's one of the best in Boston but have no desire to go back.\\n\\nCompared to the average Boston restaurant, Craigie on Main is much better, much different. But the whole appeal which you are paying for is for it to be better and different than your average Boston restaurant. So its a low bar, which they and about 30 other restaurants easily clear.\\n\\nThe other thing that makes it hard is that the experience of Craigie is very different depending on where you sit. We asked to be sat at the bar that looks into the open kitchen to see all the meals being prepared.  Which I would recommend, though would caution that if you are someone that gets anxious for other people, your entire dinner is side-lined by the fact that you are hoping that that one cook that dropped the four nearly done haddock doesn't get fired  because as instant replay would have totally shown that the oven has pretty serious design flaws or that the fresh out of culinary school chef that prepares the little appetizers will get more confidence and guidance throughout the show.  Because basically if you are sitting at the table you are enjoying a show, The food you eat isn't really enough to tear you away from it.   If you don't sit at the open table, you are probably just going to hear dropped pans and people screaming, but miss all the aggressive comments muttered under breath, all the panic. \\n\\nWe did the tasting menu, the 8 courser.  Which with the number of small addons they give you is actually an 11 courser. And its a gut puncher. You are going to need to walk home.  For me, the dessert, a three course service disguised as the final course became anxiety-provoking. How rude is it to just say I am sure so much care went into this intricately prepared chocolate roll but if I eat it I might throw up? \\n\\nThe main damning critique for the restaurant, is that none of the meals were especially memorable. When counting up/down the courses we couldn't  really remember them all. There were only two that really stuck with us, the polenta and fried egg, and the plum soup soda, as these were the gustatorially surprising and fun, interrupting what felt more like a conveyor belt of high quality but not especially interesting courses."},{"name":"Revelry","address":"210 SE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Loving it.

When me and my two friend arrived he was in the back and the pizza cook said he would be with us momentarily.  No big deal.

I'd really like to give them 4 1/2 stars, but that's not an option, so I'm giving them a boost to 5 stars.  As a note, they have recently hired a new head chef, and from our experiences, he is fantastic.  There was live music in the front, which we are usually not a fan of (my wife is a classical musician with perfect pitch), but this was done tastefully.  Not too loud, and instrumental only.\\n\\nMy first experience was dinner on a Saturday evening.  Everything was fantastic.  My wife and I brought a nice 2001 Super Tuscan and paid the $20 corkage fee to have it with dinner, which is a reasonable fee.  Our waiter, Dino, decanted the bottle nicely and was very attentive all evening, without being intrusive.  We had one of the \\"romantic booth\\" tables in the back and enjoyed the ambiance greatly.\\n\\nWe started our evening with the Beef Carpaccio, which was divine.  Tender slices of beef, topped with jullianed Asian Pear, fried capers, micro greens, and a panko-crusted soft egg yolk that broke when you cut into it.  The skill / technique on the egg yolk was nothing short of outstanding.  My wife and I both had the Mediterranean Salads, with artisnal feta, and they were also excellent.  For our mains, I had a blackened Black Grouper over Marscapone  Polenta, and my wife had a Delmonico with braised Chard and Butternut Squash puree.  The entrees were well prepared and delicious.  We finished the evening with a blood orange semi-fredo and some champagne before heading upstairs to the dance club.  All in all, one of the best meals I've ever had.  It falls short of my experiences at Picasso in the Bellagio and Craftsteak, but for a non-acclaimed restaurant, one of the best meals I've ever had.  \\n\\nThe dance club was pretty dead at 10:00, but by 11:15 was hopping.  DJ kept the dance floor busy, and there was a nice mix of 20-somethings, 30-somethings, and some 40-somethings dancing.\\n\\nOur second experience was the next day for Father's Day Brunch (yes, we were so impressed we went back for brunch the next day).  Another great meal, although I'd probably only rate this one 4 stars (hence my desire for a 4 1/2 star rating).  I had a tasty Baked Potato soup, a trio of Egg Benedicts, and Beignets for desert. My only knock is that the spinach on the Benedicts was over salted for my palate, but I'm very sensitive to salt and no one else in our party had that complaint.  Service was again fantastic (waitress was Chris this time around), polite and prompt, without being intrusive.\\n\\nThe only thing wrong with Circa is that is was relatively empty, but hopefully that will start to change.  I think they've got multiple bad reviews on Yelp from a single party with a bad experience and that is dragging their rating down.  Give them a try, you certainly wont be disappointed with the food.  We'll be going back, you can count on that.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I can say about this meal was that the restaurant was so empty."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here for drinks only.

However, I left with a bitter taste in my mouth. \\n\\nI was in Boston for 3 days. On my second day here, I end up chatting it up with a local and she highly recommended this place. I promptly looked it up on yelp and the reviews look fantastic! So I stopped by early the next day, filled with excitement to try this place out. Waited in line, no problem, that's to be expected. Promptly seated, excellent.

Then, he said to me, \\"put your phone away and eat your supper!!\\" \\n\\nI was sort of caught off guard and a little embarrassed. Since it is a small restaurant, almost everyone turned around and was staring at me. I shrugged my shoulder and laughed it off thinking maybe he was just trying to be funny and promptly thanked him and put my phone away.

I was okay being talked down to like an 8 year old, I have thick skin, it didn't bother me all that much. But when you start to mess with people's food without even asking, now that is crossing the line. To be honest, the food was probably pretty good, but I was so fumed I didn't even enjoy it. If I pay $30+ for a meal, I expect at least the meal would be the way I wanted it and a little bit of courtesy and respect. By having great food doesn't mean you can mistreat your customers.

Lets start with a quick listing of the items we ordered.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n\\nGrilled Spanish Octopus $18\\ncipollini onions, fresh hearts of palm, chorizo sauce\\n\\nAssiette of Three Terrines: Quatre Foies, Fromage de Tete, Lamb Rillettes  $15\\ntraditional accompaniments\\n\\nSalad of Hiramasa Sashimi $17\\npine nut-mango salsa, avocado, whitefish roe, shiso\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nOrganic Hangar Steak √† la Po√™le $36\\nbone marrow, smoked beef tongue, shiitake mushrooms, Camargue red rice, walnut-foie gras pur√©e\\n\\nGrilled Vermont Organic Pork Belly two ways $36\\nwalnut-foies gras pur√©e, crispy shallots\\n\\nWine:\\n\\n2003 Rosso di Maremma, Tuscany $109\\nMassa Vecchia\\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nMarket Fruits Crisp $10\\nchampagne mango and rhubarb, macadamia nut topping, tarragon ice cream*\\n\\nTotal tab without tips was around $260.\\n\\nBy Boston standards, the food was above average.  The ingredients were first rate, execution and technique above average, while the level of imagination with the ingredients was merely average.   With regards to the wine list, I thought it was narrow, limiting and not particularly well edited.  The entire list was devoid of any fine US wines.  It was heavily Franco centric with a smattering of Italian vintages.  \\n\\nOf the three appetizers, the best of the lot was the Salad of Hiramasa Sashimi.  The sashimi was well sliced and nicely paired with pine nut-mango salsa and avocado serves at the perfect  temparture.  At restaurants, you very often get sashimi that is ice cold because it was just taken out of the freezer. The grilled octopus was a bit under seasoned, but otherwise it was nicely grilled without being rubbery.  The charcuterie plate was just ok... nothing exceptional.\\n\\nThe hanger steak was well marinated and grilled to perfection, but the smokey marinade completed obliterated the accompaniment of bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, shiitake mushrooms, Camargue red rice, and walnut-foie gras pur√©e.  It was a shame.  My wife had the pork and it was again very good, but not memorable.\\n\\nThe dessert was a real disappointment.  The fruit crisp was luke warm with the filling of champagne mango and rhubarb indistinguishable from each other.  A fine dinning restaurant should not serve such a \\"peasant\\" desert at $10.  Its time that this place invest in a real pastry chef.\\n\\nLastly, the wine list needs some attention as discussed earlier.  Again with the price points of the entrees, a knowledgeable sommelier would be helpful.\\n\\nSo you ask why it is only three stars if its above average.  Because the rating are based upon food not just in Boston, but around the world.  The rub here is that the price point at Craigie is pretty much at the top end of the Boston market and there are a number of places that offer a superior overall experience.  They include Clio, Dante, Carmen and 51 Lincoln.\\n\\nLooks like Maws has a few more things to learn from Oringer.\\n\\nThis will not be a place we will frequent."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Was in Boston forthe weekend and this was dinner just by walking around the streets in Cambridge.What a find!Roof top dining a must!

I didn't know what to expect from The Onion as I have only been in Austin for 4 days.  I hope I lose no credit in the hood as pizza is pizza.  As I walked up to the place I am trying to take it all in. I can't stop thinking about The Onion satire paper.  Are they fans?  Do they just love the taste of onions?   As we walked in we were greeted as if we were walking into my best friend's house for a party.  You are quick to notice it's a two man show and they aren't trying to be the prettiest or fanciest place in town. They are two guys making an honest pizza.  Now I am not one for reheated slices unless its 2am and drunk to the point where everything sounds like a great idea.  So we skipped the slices and waited it out for a whole pie.  While waiting for our pie, I couldn't help but notice the people coming in and out and how the guys treated everyone.  They had a pretty busy lunch with the local workers coming in for a quick slice to go.  I noticed they never ran out of pizza and no slice sat too long, again 2 guys answering phones, taking orders, greeting people, getting slices, making more pizzas and hey even delivering on a crotch rocket.  It was pretty great to see.  So after about 10 mins our pizza is ready,  I can't wait to try some Austin pizza and get to work on things.  First thing I notice is that the pizza looks great.  Now I don't like to eat pizza super fucking hot out of the oven so I had to wait for the lava to cool off.  Once a little cooler,  I dove right in.  Mozzarella with a hint of cheddar and some pepperoni, an honest mans pizza, a pizza that if you can't do that right, then there is no hope for you.  I was pleasantly surprised when I ate the first slice. Not that it was anything amazing or new, but when I go into a place my expectations are in the gutter.  I have no hope anyone can make a good pizza anymore, so if it is a step above Gatti 's pizza I can deal with it.  I am not into spicy sauce (reminds me of pizza hut) but The Onion's pie was not the worst thing I have had in my mouth.  The cheese was pretty good, the pepperoni was good also, but I felt like the whole thing was to just mask the dull cardboard flavor of the crust and dough.  I think good pizza should flow.  I think the crust should taste good, which makes the sauce taste good, which makes the cheese taste good.  Again, at 2 am when I am drunk and downtown and want pizza, that's the place I will go, but it was noon and I was not hung over so it was just a decent pizza. Not great, not amazing but I think that's why they call it \\"The best pizza you'll never remember\\" because it is not out to break records or wow people.  It's a good pie when you're drunk or hung over and that's about it"},{"name":"Buddha Thai Cuisine","address":"2719 Iris Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"We love this place!!

Best breakfast I have had in a long while--and I eat a lot of good breakfasts. Yesterday I had the tortilla a la Romana, which was also very good--but not as good as the Pisto Manchego. Service is good, and speedy.

How can you go wrong with fig-infused vodka with a side of blue cheese crumbles for a chaser?  Delish!  We started off with the tartar and seared tuna appetizers, a round of muscles and some orders of fries.  You have to do the fries here.  They are fried in beef drippings (vegetarians beware!), and they are OH-SO-GOOD.  Maybe the best fries I've had.  The appetizers were both interesting and delicious, but the muscles were a little disappointing.  They didn't seem as fresh as they should be and the sauce was just okay in my opinion.  It wasn't bad, just not drop-dead great like everything else was.  If I were going to do it all over again, I would go for the fries, maybe one appetizer, a beer or cocktail and then head straight for the main courses.  Each of the six women at the table actually wound up getting a different main course and I cannot express how amazing each dish was.  We were all pretty full before the mains even came, but somehow they all disappeared.  We did a sampling around the table because each dish was fantastic.  I picked the lamb and I've never had better.  Perfect blend of spices and meat literally just crumbling off the bone with just my fork.  Beautiful couscous with eggplant to go with it.  I wanted to get a doggy-bag just for gravy that was still on the plate at the end.    We didn't have time for dessert unfortunately (too long with the cocktails and we had another thing to get to), but I have to say this restaurant I would make the trip back to Vancouver just to eat there again.

I say rice as it really was more rice than risotto.   \\n\\nFor dessert my husband got a cannoli that was really good.   I chose the ricotta cheesecake which was good but not what I expected as a) the waiter said it had chocolate chips in in when in fact it had strawberry glaze on the top instead and b) it really tasted more like regular cheesecake than ricotta.      \\n\\nWhen we got the bill we noticed the waiter had forgotten to add our second bottle of wine so we flagged him down to get that corrected.     Stega is not cheap and if our friend's sharp eyes had not noticed the wine was missing, we wouldn't have noticed as the total was steep enough to make one thing it was in there!

Parking is directed by off-duty members of the sheriff's department, and they don't appreciate you slowing down and backing up traffic.  Unless you want to experience some authentic Texas Justice, just move along.\\n\\nSecond, bring your own alcohol, in a cooler.  Driftwood is in a dry county, so they don't serve any.  This is better anyways, who wouldn't rather provide their own booze at a lower price?\\n\\nThird, pack some waters in that cooler.  Although Salt Lick provides water, it's not what connoisseurs would call \\"good tasting.\\"  They would probably be more inclined to call it \\"dumpster runoff.\\"\\n\\nFourth, get the family style.  It's totally worth it, even if you can't eat much, to try everything on the menu.\\n\\nFifth, bring CASH.  They don't accept credit cards.  An ATM/Debit card will do just fine, as they have an ATM on-site.\\n\\nThat's it.  Enjoy the best BBQ you'll find on either side of the Mason-Dixon.

The lobby can get a little crowded since it is basically non-existant, but who cares, right? We showed up after camping for three days and had a ton of gear that needed to be stored because check in was a few hours off still. A friendly kid took all of our stuff and tagged it and waited while we changed in a downstairs bathroom and then he stored everything. The rooms are funkily decorated and the whole place has a rock theme with different songs for the rooms. We had Blondie \\"Heart of Glass,\\" which is not my first or tenth choice, but it was still awesomely entertaining (and not a bad tune just not exactly my personal style versus some of the classic rockers and blues tunes). Anyhow, the shared bathroom thing is NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL. You get in with your room key to a bathroom with a shower and a toilet and a sink...in other words, you aren't sharing it with anyone when you use it. There are four of them on each floor and we never had a problem finding an open one. In fact, I went to the same one each time. You have your own towels, foot mat, robes, shampoo, etc., in your room and your room has a vanity with sink so you really just cruise down, shower and cruise back to get ready in your room. Awesome. For the price difference it's a no brainer. You CAN get a king room with it's own bathroom, but I see no reason to shy away from the queen rooms (bring some cheap-o flippy floppies if you're feeling uptight).

My favorites are the tom ka soup, the pad thai, and the massaman curry. The soup is a lot richer than what you'll find at most Thai places, and they're also not afraid to kick up the spiciness. There's nothing particularly distinctive about the pad thai (maybe a bit more sauce than normal) or the curry, but both are just made really well, with a good balance of flavors.\\n\\nThe portions are also generous, and the prices are fantastic."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This gotta be the best restaurant I went to since I've been back to US.

Don't let the potoato wedges fool you into thinking it's just another potato wedges because it's a delicacy in its own right.

What often happens at kbbq places, Yasu included, that I've experienced is that they tend to let your meat overcook.\\n\\nOh, and their ban chan oh my god!

We also ordered the clams app- that was amazing, however again 5 small clams for $18. Entrees were very small portions, but flavorful.

Arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday with no chance at a table without a reservation (people like good food I guess - who knew?), but we snagged the corner seats and the bar which were some of the most comfortable bar seats I've ever experienced (I hate bar seats...I'm short).\\n\\nTom, the head of the bar, is a very nice guy!  It may have helped that my friend I was with was buddy buddy with him, but he knew what he was doing and was very friendly and knowledgeable, even with the patrons around us.  \\n\\nThey take care of you here - gourmet service all the way, even at the bar.  We decided to do the $75 prix fixe menu, because it seemed that everything we wanted was on there anyways.  They have a different and seemingly fantastic bar menu as well - I wish I could have eaten 3 dinners at once.  For the Amuse Bouche course I can't remember what my friend had, but I had pork belly and oh.  my.  god.  It was like the best tastes of prosciutto and bacon in one, mixed with some shaved crispy pear. Gah.  I commented to my friend that I don't understand why the most delicious food has to sound so unappealing.  Pork belly?  Really?  Yes.  Really.  F'in get it. (and that was just two bites of food!)\\n\\nFor the App course we each got the asparagus soup with pork jowl croutons (again...why?).  I think it takes some serious skill to do a soup exceedingly well and Tony Maws, my friends, has some serious skizills.  And those croutons?  WTF?!  Delicious little nuggets of salty heaven.\\n\\nThe entree choice was easy - my friend got Lamb 3 ways, and I got the dayboat scallops.  Good GOD those scallops were good.  If you like seafood, and seafood done well, I highly recommend them.  I'm a cute-atarian (don't eat cute things - sure, go ahead and laugh), so I don't \\"eat\\" lamb persay, but I tried my friend's and wow.  Kinda makes me want to eat cute sheepies on a regular basis.\\n\\nWe were given a palette cleanser before dessert of infused panna cotta (mine with rooibos, his with jasmine) and this alcoholic drink called milk punch I think?  I don't think that's exactly right, but it was clear and amazingly interesting.  I'd never even dreamed of either dish and they were really inventive and a great experience.\\n\\nDessert was a peanut butter parfait for me (pb mousse between two rectangular cookie-biscuits with some kind of grape foam on top) and an Olive Oil and Tazzo chocolate mousse for my friend.  Mine was more interesting than awesome (though it was pretty good), and his was drool-inducing.\\n\\nSo - long story short (too late) - it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience with excellent food in a fun atmosphere that was upscale and casual at the same time.

You could tell that it has been slow braised for a while. Soft, tender, and really moist. The richness was complemented by the pickled carrots and radishes. For something so rich, you really needed the right amount of acid to cut through and those pickles did their job. The Korean Fried Chicken was just as delicious.

I was a little bit disappointed but I'd be interested in coming back.\\n\\nWe went for a friend's birthday, so there were 10 of us eating dinner. We had a reservation for 9:30pm, so we loaded up on tequila and guacamole at Papagayo before then. Good thing we ate something, because we weren't seated until 10:45 or so. I know it's hard to seat a large party and you can't kick folks out if they're not leaving, but sitting down over an hour after our reservation was a little bit of a bummer. They did offer us a few free shrimp sliders, so that helped tide us over a little bit.\\n\\nThe plus side of waiting around so long for our table was that we all got to try some beers off their FANTASTIC beer list. They have Trillium beer, which is good because they're right next door, along with tons of other really great and interesting options. One of the best lists I've seen at a new restaurant in a while, so huge points for that.\\n\\nWe started with some oysters for the table, which were all delicious. No surprise there. Their special Row 34 oysters, which are apparently raised right next to Island Creek oysters but are elevated off the ocean floor, were quite tasty.\\n\\nIt was frigid outside, so for dinner I decided I wanted some soup. I ordered the clam chowder and a Caesar salad to come out together as my main course. The clam chowder was WAY, WAY too salty. Which is a huge bummer, because the ingredients were all pretty good. The soup itself was just a little bit too heavy for me -- you could see the butter floating on the top and it had a bit too much cream -- but usually I'm fine with that. But it was just so hard to taste anything else because it tasted like an entire salt shaker was dumped into my soup. The kitchen was supposed to close at 11, and it was now far past that, so perhaps the kitchen was in a rush, but it was still a pretty big let down. The Caesar salad was okay, but I wish the dressing had been tossed in with the greens to evenly coat it. Most of the dressing was down at the bottom. There was a nice anchovy flavor in the dressing, but it also tasted like there was a bit too much mayo in there. And I hate mayo.\\n\\nMy fiancee got the Monkfish special, which was cooked to perfection. Really, really tasty. She also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts, which were god awful. I don't remember exactly what the menu said they were flavored with (and the website looks like it's down at the moment), but the flavor combination was all wrong. There was a hint of orange zest in there, but also garlic and other spices and they just did not mix well at ALL.

First, I should remark how impressed I was that within hours of posting my first review (on a Sunday, no less), I was contacted by Jeffrey Gates, an owner of the restaurant, with an apology for our bad experience and the very generous invitation to come back and try Aquitaine again.  We did, on a quieter evening midweek, and I'm happy to say that I fully believe that our first meal at Aquitaine was the exception.  It appears their commitment to customer service and excellent food are well intact.\\n\\nWe returned on a Monday evening.  We had made a reservation, and were greeted and led to our table immediately.  I noticed that the table we had been seated at the last time had been removed entirely - a very good move in my opinion.  We decided to skip an appetizer so as to leave room for dessert.  I got a very nice glass of pino grigio and the bread (and those little roasted garlic cloves, YUM) was delicious.  I don't know if they make the bread on-site, but to be fair I should say that I've rarely found bread that good on this side of the Atlantic.\\n\\nI wanted to go with a different dish, but another bistro classic, so I chose the sole meuniere.  My husband initially ordered the same steak I had gotten last time, but when he specified that he wanted it 'well-done', our excellent waiter thoughtfully suggested that if he wanted a well-done steak, he might go with a different cut because the bar steak is better cut to consume more rare.  Interesting!  Perhaps this same information from our server the last time would have changed my decision too - anyway, our waiter also told us that we could have all the accoutrements of the bar steak but with a cut that was more like a hangar steak which would stand up to more cooking.  My husband decided to go with that and claimed it one of the best steaks he's ever eaten.  I tasted it too, and had to agree.  Perfectly cooked this time, and very tender.  Also, the carmelized shallots and mustard cream that topped the steak were delicious.  I kept stealing bites.  My sole meuniere was excellent too, the fish was perfectly cooked, covered in a light yet rich lemon-butter sauce and resting on a bed of silky mashed potatoes and thinly sliced snap peas that added just the right amount of crunch. \\n\\nAlthough we barely had room for dessert (portions were quite generous) we had to give it a try, so my husband ordered the creme brulee and I chose the molten chocolate pudding cake.  True enough, I've never met a molten chocolate cake I didn't like, but this one was very good indeed.  The creme brulee also easily met everyone's standards.  \\n\\nThroughout the evening, the staff was solicitous and I especially have to give a shout-out to our waiter, who was obviously an expert on both service and the food.  We SO appreciated his extra effort in guiding our menu choices and thought he maintained the perfect 'vibe' with us throughout the night - efficient, friendly and knowledgeable, we felt neither ignored nor smothered, he knew just when to pop in and check on us.  Five stars for him.\\n\\nNow we may just have to come back to Aquitaine for brunch.

I ordered a stout from the area, a tart, citrusy wheat ale from athens and their special bottle pour of a Porter from Massachusetts. All three were great, but I knew what I was getting into. Although I didn't plan on eating here, the hostess and the couple next to me did a great job of selling the locally sourced, made in house every day menu. I quickly realized I couldn't leave without eating less the locals quickly take their pitchforks to my tourist heart.\\n\\nI got their cheddar bacon burger with a side of mac and cheese, served with a homemade sweet and spicy pickle and house \\"slutty\\" sauce (some horseradish mayo concoction). The pickle was awesome. Most places dint have good pickles these days. The burger was juicy, cooked exactly medium and loaded with fresh cheddar and bacon. The sauce was also a good addition to the bigger, adding some zest and tang.\\n\\nThe real star, despite being a side, was the mac and cheese. One of the best I've ever eaten. It was large macaroni noodles (the only acceptable noodle for true mac and cheese) with a gooey mix of god's best cheeses that didn't gum up my mouth or leave me wanting something more satisfying. Topped with another layer of melted cheese and a crunchy crumble, the texture blended perfectly with the taste.

I pretty much hate to do anything on Mondays. I called them up and as it turns out they're not open on Mondays. Meh, whatever. Everyone needs a day off.\\n\\nThey slip my mind for months. The orange awning occasionally reminded me of their presence but never at the right time. We were always just ships in the night, Lime Leaf and I.\\n\\nSo one day I finally get around to trying it out. Holy crap, this joint knows its product. The people were all very kind (I came in like 5 minutes before close) and accommodating.  I panicked because I didn't want to keep them late and just ordered Yellow River off the noodle section and a few apps. Wow, dude. That's what I have to say.\\n\\nThe mussels were HUGE. Not giant, tough mussels but just big and soft and full of flavor. The scallops were perfect. Everything was perfect actually. I'm one of those people who picks out the things I don't like or I'd like less of and I found myself trying to scrape the last few drops of sauce and egg out of the bottom of the container. It crushed Sweet Lemons and Little Duck like a dragon crushes a gnat.\\n\\nSo considering that this place is about a 3 minute drive from my house and I would drive to Framingham for Thai this good, I'd say I'm quite pleased. Now I can make the easy Stop & Shop, Curtis, Lime Leaf trip in a few minutes and not have to leave my house for the whole weekend."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Giacomo's (pronounced jockamos by the staff) is wonderful.

I had a difficult time choosing what to order, but I'm so happy with my choice of the biscuit and gravy with chicken sausage, scrambled eggs, and cheese grits. Everything was perfect, and the first bite of the biscuit smothered in gravy was pure heaven. A single pancake made for the best \\"dessert\\". I kept the pancake simple with no toppings, and it was worth the extra $1.50 to my check. If you want a sweet finish to your meal, I'd recommend trying the pancake, but it also looked like they had a few baked goods in the front.\\n\\nSERVICE: I was happy with the service. The place was relatively empty when I arrived (Sunday at around 10:15 am), so I was seated quickly, and the food arrived soon after I ordered. I have no complaints.\\n\\nAREA: I love this part of Atlanta. I went for a long morning run through the Oakland Cemetery, Cabbagetown and the Beltline, and it was great!

Showed up at 6pm, thinking we were going to have to wait..but lo and behold, they went to seat us right away! We were downstairs in one of those chamber rooms. Kinda eery... I think there were 6 tables all together, all spaced next to the wall, so no one was really close to me, maybe behind one of us, but not next door. They had these lamps that were lit by real fire light aka a candle. I wonder what woulda happened if I had pushed it over because I thought it was a light bulb... the room was very dimly lit...so it kind of casted a sad/depressed mood over me, and it was horrendous for my camera since no flash means you couldn't see anything, but with flash everything is too bright!\\n\\nAnyways, they came to take our order pretty quick, so I requested more time to look over the menu. I ordered the steak house salad with House Vinaigrette and then the Filet as my main entree with a side of sauteed mushrooms and the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake as dessert.\\n\\nMy sorority sister got pretty much the same thing but instead of salad got the Crab & Corn Chowder and instead of the cheesecake got the regular cheesecake at $10 extra.

Okay, guess it was just the name. It was great, I really enjoyed it that i ate everything but the onions because im not a big onion fan, the dressing was superb.\\n\\nfilet- i ordered RARE. I saw a lot of reviews saying it was too buttery.. I do not see it. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS WAS THE MOST AMAZING STEAK I'VE HAD next to morton's where i got the filet mignon. The plate is heated 500 degrees so it can still cook after you cut up your steak and js lay it there, but do it early, because the plate will get cold and you will eat rare meat. haha, it was amazing, soo delicious, it was like i don't even need to chew!!! okay, maybe that was a bit exaggerated but it was soo good. Perfection.\\n\\nsauteed mushrooms- they give you like 6-8 but i felt it had a very strong mushroom smell so i rather eat my steak instead. It was okay\\n\\nChocolate Mousse Cheesecake- very moussy. Very good, perfect size. LOVE that there was whipped cream, my fave, and the garnish made a great presentation. it wasn't too sweet, js perfect\\n\\nregular cheesecake- this is what their famous for right?! It was pretty big, Very cheesy. I liked it, the crust was a good crispness so it was good. \\n\\nService- good, my water never went under 1/3 full before it was filled, which is very important. Though...they did bring out the check when i didn't ask...and wanted to take it away WHILE i was like not even half way into my dessert. Stop trying to shooo me out!

For a bar, they offer a good variety of food as the chef here used to work at the defunct Seeger's in Buckhead.  On the front of the menu, you'll find the specials page.  This is where all the fun is at.  The rest of the menu features typical pub grub with many of the items using fresh ingredients and/or having a \\"gourmet\\" twist.\\n\\nExamples of some specials I've tried include the Japanese pork ramen and the chicken liver pate.  One of the last things I'd expect to find at The Porter is a bowl of ramen, complete with thin slices of pork and scallion on top.  It was even served in a traditional Japanese bowl with a small wooden ladle!  The broth was thin, but overall, the dish turned out OK.\\n\\nThe chicken liver pate was served in a jar with slices of French bread and pickled vegetables such as carrots and cauliflower.  It was very good, though the pate was not very thick and quite runny.  When we ran out of bread, our server brought us more.\\n\\nThe food I think is the best here is the salt and vinegar popcorn.  Juichia C. introduced this app to me and said in one of her reviews that it is addicting.  I can't agree more.  They toss the popcorn in salt and powdered vinegar and serve it in a metal bowl.  It's really delicious and you can't stop eating until it's all gone.  Kudos to The Porter for producing some of the best popcorn I've ever had.\\n\\nI've also tried The Porter's half pound cheeseburger.  The beef patty was thick, but too tough for a burger.  The toppings were fresh and included unique items like cucumber and housemade pickles and pickled red onion.  I'm not sure what type of bread was used (it tasted like and resembled some sort of cheese bread), but it was not very good.  The bun was cold and soggy.  These factors plus the near $12 price tag made this burger disappointing.\\n\\nA good beer I've had here is the Delirium Tremens (Belgian pale ale).  I'm told it's one of The Porter's more popular beers and commonly referred to as the beer with the pink elephants.\\n\\nI like the atmosphere here.  The bar has character and it's a cool place to hang out.  Late at night, on the weekends, it's mostly twenty and thirty-somethings.  The service could be better.

Granted, your interaction with a host(ess) is fleeting, but they set the tone of your experience since they're the first person you interact with.

Our server, on the other hand, was friendly & attentive throughout the whole time we were there. \\n\\nWe ordered the bruschetta & the prosciutto sandwich; both were beyond disappointing. The bruschetta was some of the worst I'd ever had - akin to something made by Stouffer's in the freezer aisle, or those english muffin pizzas you made when you were a kid (only this is the adult version with chopped tomatos.) No flavor (tomatos marinated in what? water?), way too much bread that was barely toasted, & I don't even know what they were going for with all the cheese. The sandwich wasn't much better - the bottom of the baguette was soaked through with the 'balsamic glaze,' which I think was poured onto the sandwich to disguise the sorry fact that the prosciutto & tomatos had zero flavor. I really don't understand how a restaurant, in the middle of fresh, yummy tomato season, can have such bland vegetables. We suffered through a few bites each, & then just ate the fries that came with it - which, fortunately, were pretty good.\\n\\nOur drinks weren't much better. I had whatever summer cocktail they offered that was a variation on vodka & cucumber, & the dude had a gin & tonic. The gin & tonic came as a glass of gin, with a little bottle of tonic water - I guess so that you can mix it yourself. I can't decide if I really like that move, or really don't. Regardless, my cocktail was uninspired, & I didn't finish it.\\n\\n(As an aside: the dude commented on the name of the place & wondered if they'd have an Icarus burger or cocktail or something. Nope.

Earlier this evening I called in an order for pick up. I ordered a Number 7 Combo (sesame chicken, fried rice, an egg roll) and pot stickers. What that translated to was chicken nuggets with a side of ketchup, dry rice with no flavor, a flimsy sad little log that semi resembled an egg roll, and fried plastic. \\n\\nSesame chicken is usually served in some sort of sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds. This restaurants version, I suppose, is fried little pieces of chicken which have no sesame flavor whatsoever. If I wanted chicken nuggets I would have gone to McDonalds...where I could have ordered basically the same thing quality wise but would have gotten 20 for $5. To make matters worse, this chicken wasn't even accompanied by a special dipping sauce. Instead, we received a little plastic container of ketchup. The rice was dry, not properly cooked and tasted like air. Usually fried rice is also jazzed up a bit with some other ingredients; onions, peas, carrots just to name a few. All of these were absent. An egg did make it to the party, however, and by that I mean one little piece of scrambled egg that was the size of my thumb nail. The egg roll was mushy and had not crispy aspect to it as egg rolls should. And the pot stickers? Well if you're a fan of gnawing on plastic than this is the dish for you. The only thing that made it semi better was the little cup of dipping cause it came with, which when I think about it, was pretty much just an overload of salt flavor wise. This restaurant has it all wrong. Disclaimer: I wasn't expecting the world, but I know what basic Americanized Chinese food is, and when I order sesame chicken I expect sesame chicken, not \\"sesame\\" chicken nuggets.

I was also hesitant about eating a buffet cuz I start thinking about cleanliness and then I get reminded of the low quality buffet food in Vegas. But I found myself craving it so I had to do it. So here's the scoop:\\nGheymeh really good,\\nChicken Brest kabob very salty, bademjoon not that great, saladovieh pretty good but overly fattening (normal), my favorite rice was the one with carrots.\\nWhat I really liked was that the owner came by to check on everything, he checked the buffet tables and noted they needed more rice.  And I really liked how the workers all seemed to really like their job. I was asked if I wanted more soda plenty of times thankfully cuz that really annoys me when no one comes around for refills but the really tall guy with longish hair was on top of it!

Unfortunately, at 9:30am, Flour Bakery & Cafe had already sold out their batch for the day.  Perhaps the complexity as to why more of these \\"infamous\\" Sticky Cinnamon Buns are not produced is beyond my comprehension.  Everyone comes for the Sticky Buns, but everyone is also left to accept their second choice offerings.  Nevertheless, walking all the way from Old City Hall it would be irresponsible to leave without sampling some of Flour Bakery + Cafe's offerings.\\n\\nThe Setting:  Upbeat and lively are two terms that best describe the atmosphere at Flour.  Ranging from the perfectly positioned spot lighting to pine stained Formica table tops, the ambiance at Flour is observed as being laid back and relaxing.  Most of the seating at the establishment is first come / first serve and seats anywhere from 25 to 30 patrons at any given time.  Patrons waiting for their orders can view the array of baked offerings available at the display counter for which orders are placed.\\n\\nThe Food...\\n\\nChocolate Fudge Brownie:  Perhaps this should be renamed the \\"Chocolate Fudge BAR\\".  Subtle in its visual appeal, weighty in its compositional structure, the Chocolate Fudge Brownie appeared to be more of a dense chocolate fudge bar rather than a brownie.  At first bite, patrons will find that the medium to heavy firmness of the brownie allows one to question the proportions of flour in the construction of this application.  The dense nature of the brownie made it slightly difficult to chew, thus hindering any potency in flavor of the application.  From what was observed, the intense flavors of the chocolate brownie were evident.  Unfortunately, the common representation of a moist and delicate brownie was not to be had with Flour's rendition.  What should be praised about Flour's rendition is the ability to produce subtle and harmonious flavors without having the chocolate portion of the application overpower all other structural components.  Sadly, additional consumption will render only that of a heavy dense chocolate block.  Still, in moderation, the Chocolate Fudge Brownie should be praised for its execution.  Sadly, excessive consumption will leave the jaw tiring and desperately seeking a glass of skim milk.\\n\\nBoston Creme Pie:  Delicate, fluffy & subtly sweet!  Needless to said, perfection is presented in Flour's rendition of the classic edible.  Initial consumption will reveal a slightly delicate sweetness derived from the cream, which is amplified by the fluffy composition of the pastry.  What is most commendable about Flour's application is the subtle / delicate flavors introduced in this application.  The Boston Creme Pie itself was not excessively sweet, thus helping to introduce the hearty flavors of the dark chocolate.  Further consumption will reveal an escalation in the subtle sweetness and perfectly produced texture of the application.  Needless to say, there were no leftovers.\\n\\nPersonal note to self...  When going to Flour Bakery + Cafe during the next venture, be sure to arrive at 7:30am to ensure the receipt of the Sticky Cinnamon Bun.  Of course, I am still perplexed as to why Flour doesn't just produce more?"},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I used to live down at German Villiage... this was my favorite hangout in the afternoon... after spending a day at the book loft.

Outrageous prices,  and their Monday \\"any burrito\\" deal does not include steak, though their advertising makes no mention of this.  You will be charged extra, and the cashier is blissfully unaware of this.  She was friendly, but initially told me it came to a higher amount because of taxes, but then realized it was more because it was steak. What is this? Taco-bell?   A steak burrito is pretty squarely in the normal realm of \\"any burrito\\" the last time I checked.  I notified the manager (aka the creepy sallow faced man who stands behind the cashiers and barks orders) that it was deceptive.  He did not even respond to me. \\n\\nThe food was decidedly mediocre.  No real flavor to the beans or rice.  The sour cream looked like melted marshmallow, not displaying a healthy consistency, perhaps watered down.  The steak that they charged extra for was barely present in this burrito, and the pieces I did encounter were tough and sinewy.\\n\\nCongratulations Moe's, you gave me an awful enough experience where I actually wrote a Yelp review.  I've never pulled the trigger and reviewed here, but your poor quality food, poor management, deceptive pricing combined with the overall airport-level cheesiness of your menu (naming everything after Seinfeld characters and themes how many years after the show is off the air) have caused me to overcome my online review writing agoraphobia and present my experience to the public.\\n\\nAlso worth noting is that when I asked for re-fried beans, they slopped pinto beans on the burrito.  The servers were friendly, but I think they should know what re-fried beans are...\\n\\nSo to to to make this review more helpful, and if you are in the camp of people who just see this as a convenient location, look around Waltham, pretty much anything is a better option.  Try Carl's just down the street for an awesome burrito, or go to one of the many mom and pop Mexican restaurants in the area.

Since the 3 is more recent, that's what the rating is.  Let's start with the good:\\n\\nThe first time I came here I ordered a plate of calamari, a Friacomo (mixed Fra Diavolo and Giacamo) fettucini with shrimp and scallops, and the butternut squash ravioli.  The food was simply AMAZING.  I used to think calamari could not really undo other calamaris...but boy was I wrong.  The little peppers and the perfectly fried rings were freaking delicious.  The Friacomo was also out of this world - although the scallops tasted somewhat...metallic?  The butternut squash was super rich and unique and I was definitely glad I had that as well.\\n\\nNow for the worse experience:\\n\\nThe second time I ordered (why change what was great before right?) a plate of calamari, the Friacomo fettucini with shrimp and scallops, and a salmon in lobster based cream sauce.  The new dish was great...glad I was able to try it and might even order it again.   The rest however were disappointing.  The calamari whipped out of the kitchen in about 2 minutes...but it didn't seem nearly as great as that first time.  Perhaps the batter was slightly off or they didn't add in enough jalapenos.  The bigger disappointment was the Friacomo.  First, it came with linguini which I'm not a fan of.  When we questioned the waitress, she said that's not what she heard....but then again she was in such a hurry who knows what she heard.  Also, it was a lot more liquidy this time.  I had assumed they used the same ratio everytime they mixed their Friacomo - but maybe it was more subjective than that and this time we didn't get a good mix.  Or maybe the linguini didn't soak up the liquid well, which the fettucini did, which is why we liked it so much the first time.\\n\\nAll in all, I would have waited 2 hours for that first meal I had there (even though I didn't have to).  However, for the second meal I waited 1 hour and I probably wouldn't have waited more than 10 minutes for that quality.  I'm surprised they didn't even acknowledge their mistake in the ordering.  Seriously, I'm not a compulsive liar trying to trick you into wasting food as I laugh evilly when u make a second batch.  They might not have though the difference of noodles was too big a deal - but that mistake combined with my bitterness of the mediocre calamari and sauce made for a unsatisfactory experience.\\n\\nWith all of the other good restaurants in the area, I'll at least try out another local spot for Italian next time!  This restaurant had 5-star+++ taste the first time, but if it's not consistent, what's the point?"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"worth a wait, and finger lickin' tasty."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Came here for lunch and wow the pizza was delicious!

It was a Thursday night and we were told the wait was roughly 30 minutes. We both had our respective places to be in 2 hours, which was still plenty of time. I put down my name and phone number, and the host said I would receive a text message when the table was ready -- so far so good.\\n\\nAbout 40 minutes later, no text message. I called the place, gave them my name, and they said they'd have our table ready very soon. When we arrived, they couldn't find us on the waiting list, and the table they had prepared was actually for a different guest (his name was Jake, not James). The staff apologized for their mistake but made no effort to expedite the process in any way, and they said we'd have to wait another 20 minutes for a table. In fact, when they finally did put us on the waiting list, they found my name and phone number in their database! Yes, the one that I just gave them 45 minutes earlier when I tried to get a table. (I've never been here before, and the phone number was actually my girlfriend's, so it's not one of those databases shared between restaurants.)\\n\\nAfter waiting 35 more minutes in the rain, the table was still not ready. I understand that the restaurant is busy, but after already failing to put my name in the system, I would at least hope to be seated at the next available table because I've been waiting longer than all the other parties. The entire time, the hosts seemed clueless, unresponsive, and unable to help. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and stressed after wasting so much there, so I refused to give them my business.\\n\\nI knew this night would be an important one, so I put my faith in an upscale restaurant like The Salty Pig, expecting at least decent service and organization.

I usually get the American (ham and turkey). \\n\\nOne time I wanted to try something different, so I asked the owner, Claudio, for his recommendation. He suggested the Chicken Salad and I was definitely not disappointed. It's not your average chicken salad. It's chunks of chicken breast perfectly seasoned with no celery or other added veggies.

They have a variety of breads to choose from and a whole, large chalkboard dedicated to their toppings.

The worst part was that the only time she interacted with us was to order our drinks. There were 2 tables that were seated way after we came. This lady refilled their drinks several times, updated them on the status of their food, and apologized for the wait. They got their food before us. BOTH TABLES! There were only 3 of us, and my 2 friends ordered fajitas and I ordered nachos. Nothing complicated. I had to calm my friend down several times, but eventually after waiting 2 and a half hours and the other table got their check and started to leave, we called over another waitress to have her give us a bill for our drinks (lemonades). She tells our waitress who is standing behind her that we needed a bill. She doesn't even turn around, she just goes \\"hold on and wait a minute\\". She walks off into the kitchen and literally brings out another tables food. These people came WAAAAY after us. I got up and asked for the manager very politely and quietly. I went back to my seat to wait. The manager comes over (AJ) and was very apologetic. He offered to give us our meal for free and said to ask for him when we came back and he will take care of us. My friends and I were too upset to eat, we thanked him and said we just wanted to go and to let our waitress know that she needs to treat everyone the same. She literally avoided us, we were the only black people in her section and it was very strange we were the only ones getting neglected. I don't even know her name, but she was very young with blonde hair. Horrible experience. If anyone has been discriminated against, you know exactly how it feels. Like CRAP! We went to the chilis on limbergh and had excellent service. It looked nicer and cleaner too. It was much busier over there and it only took an hour for us to get our food.

Didn't get any of that sour spicy funk that I'm familiar with. Same went with the other two bao. I couldn't help but feel like it's like 80% there. A little tweak and adjustment in the toppings would help balance the flavors a little. Oh and all the buns couldn't hold up and split.

The open faced ravioli with sea scallops was definitely the hit of the night. (I see someone posted a photo of it here! It is the large, single ravioli with the orange sauce.) The sauce was light and flavorful and everyone agreed the dish was perfectly executed/very unique. The roasted pork tenderloin was a close second; the meat was tender and the taste was excellent. Again, a wonderful sauce in that dish - not at all overwhelming. The risotto was also delicious and light - very fresh tasting, not too salty... not as much flavor as the open faced ravioli, however. \\n\\nIn terms of price, it is pretty fair for a higher-quality Italian restaurant in the north end...about $25+ per dish for our group. The only thing I would be aware of for future visits is that the restaurant is SO LOUD! It must have poor acoustics or something. We found that the sound amplified in the dining area and made it very hard to hear the people at our table.\\n\\nAlso note: no dessert or coffee at this restaurant.

It went through a few other concepts before Jax moved in and it appears they're doing well.  The downside is it feels a bit cavernous.  Huge bar though.\\n\\nWe found a place at the bar and perused the beer list.  It's huge and I think they have over 40 drafts.

The crowd was very young and I assume local.  We looked over the menu which is dominated by sandwiches and each made a selection.  I ordered the wings, my wife the cajun chicken pita pizza.\\n\\nNow for the food section.  The pita pizza came out fresh and crispy and easily worth the price charged.  The wings were a bad disappointment.  They were supposed to be the hottest flavor but weren't much hotter than black pepper.  They were also barely warm and tough.  The bartender by now was busier and it took some time for her to notice I wasn't eating them.  In the meantime I grazed off the pizza.  Once she noticed she was extremely apologetic and ordered me my own pita pizza which again came out perfectly.  \\n\\nIt was late now and time to go and the bartender surprised us by comping our last round of drinks to make up for her delay.  We didn't think she was that slow but it was a very welcome gesture.  As we were getting up a couple had their burgers delivered and I have to say they looked awesome.  Next time I'll try a burger or one of the other pita pizzas.\\n\\nAll in all a nice visit.  The wings were bad but the staff fixed it quickly and the other food made up for that shortcoming.

So when we stumbled upon this place, it seems like salted meat heaven.  When you walk in, you feel like you're sitting in a modern kitchen, with hanging meats and a gas fired oven behind the bar.  The tables look like you're sitting at a kitchen table and the chalkboards are interesting to look at.  In short, it's a visually different and nice place.\\n\\nNow for the food:\\nThey have a wide selection of different meats, cheeses, and additions (such as jalapeno jelly, fig jam, pickles, etc)  They have 4 boards that come with a set amount of meats and cheeses as well as a small amount of salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  We got the Salty Pig board, Spinach Salad with added pork belly, and the Beef Short Rib sandwich.  The SP board came with delicious, perfectly cooked bread (crunchy outside, soft inside), prosciutto, bacon wrapped pate, straciatella cheese, homemade pickles and olives.  The pickles were awesome.  They started off tasting like wet cucumber and then got sweet.  The prosciutto was tasty and not gamey in the least bit.  The pate wasn't really flavorful, but there was a lot of it compared to most places.  And the spicy mustard that came with it was deeeeeelish.\\nAs for the entrees, the spinach salad was basic and the crispy pork belly added to it was flavorless.  Just tasted like fried fat, nothing else.  As for my sandwich, I will say this.  The portion was MUCH bigger than I thought it would be for this type of place.  About a 10-12 inch sandwich on that awesome bread, the short ribs were cooked perfectly with pickled veggies and a sweet sauce.  It was a very, very good sandwich.  Overall, above average meal.\\n\\nWould I go here again.  If I was in the area, yes I would.  But this isn't the type of restaurant that I need to go out of my way to show off to people.  It was great, but not amazing.  Also, they offer various meats and cheeses a la carte if you don't want one of the boards, but they were pricey.  Something like $8 per meat.  I would have liked to have tried other meats, but not at that price, especially when I know what the portion would be.\\n\\nBut still, if you love charcuterie and a different atmosphere, this is a great place to go."},{"name":"Jimmy Hula's","address":"11556 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I always enjoy coming here.

Not too shabby. When my steak came out sizzling on a plate of hot butter, I was a bit wary at first, afraid of my meat swimming in butter. But the butter added a nice sear to the steak.

It was really a thin curry with few not well cooked vegetables and a ton of sambar masala. The dosa was OK but again there was nothing Mysore about it. The masala that came with it was OK.

If the manager hadn't comped our meal as soon as someone brought us coffee (a totally unexpected silver lining) and if the server wasn't a suburban waitress superstar, we would have left after the 15 minutes we waited for said coffee.\\n\\nThe two stars are for the people who work there. That is all. The food bombed, the decor was attempting old school Parisian grandeur  (and failing) and the patrons OH MY SWEET JESUS, the PATRONS. I can't even go there, and still feel good about myself, but let's just say that I'll never need to worry about that again. \\n\\nAs a side note, I hear the South End location is great."},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Love Love Love this place!

Described as \\"coffee ice cream, espresso, and chocolate milk\\" was more of a version of an icee - those three things blended with ice.  Made in a big blender that was already mixed/made in the fridge and then some ice thrown in and blended.  It was watery, ice chipped, and kinda gross.  My super server (he was a trooper - I'm certainly demanding) re-made it for me without ice and it was amazing.  While he was doing that, the girl that originally made it proceeded to complain that it's how it is always made, and then continued to bitch to another girl  behind that counter about it as if I just stabbed her puppy and she had to plot revenge.  I was in awe that she did this right in front of me.  Shortly after, she (and two others) accosted my poor server demanding to know why I had returned the milkshake while he was remaking it.  Really?  Was this so much the end of the world?\\n\\nThe apple and brie omelette was good, as was the challah (sp?) french toast that my friend had and her mocha had cute little hearts on the top.  Homefries do not come with the omelette (and for the price of the stuff there - they should), and $3.50 gets you a tiny plate of them (which were ICE cold the first time we ordered them).\\n\\nOverall, the food was good, the place was cute, but the experience kinda sucked.  If I wasn't spending the day with my friend - which automatically puts me in an awesome mood - I could have come out of there much bitchier.\\n\\nI may try it again sometime - maybe sitting at a table where you don't have to see how bothered everyone who works behind the counter seems to be is the way to go."},{"name":"Dim Sum Heaven","address":"5203 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Its nice to have a dim sum place where the food is made to order.

This location definitely caters to students, more so than your single location bars around campus, which try to reign in the alum crowd as well. What this means is basically that service is going to be pretty minimal, although acceptable, and the general cleanliness and order of the place goes by the wayside. Throngs of 18 to 22 year olds keep this place busy during game times, but if you want to check it out simply for what it is, the most basic recommendation I can give is avoid going within 48 hours of a Texas football game, and that time extends with an epic win or lose, as people go to drown their sorrows or fuel their fandom with cheap Lonestar pitchers and giant pieces of greasy, delicious pizza. Which brings me to the saving grace of this and all Austin's pizza locations: the pie is good. It's damn good, I'd say. However, it's overpriced. If I've got some money to burn and I'm already right there, I'll throw down for some Austin's, but if there is any deliberation going into it, there are several other locales that I would rather hit up for my money, even if they aren't so close to campus."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"What a great spot!

When dropping off new copies of the magazine at, say, Brookline Booksmith, the business took less than three minutes. At Trident, I stood around for about fifteen minutes, waiting, signing things, waiting, then given a check that was for less than the invoice called for, which did not make our senior editor too pleased.\\n\\nAnyway, I went here last night for food with Jenne K. She had chicken strips that looked pretty good and not too greasy. I got the prosciutto and brie sandwich. Let's break it down a bit.\\n\\nProsciutto is the Italian word for \\"ham.\\" But in English, prosciutto to me connotes a very delicate meat, both in cut and flavor. A dry-cured ham which has not been cooked and is usually paper-thin. Instead, this sandwich had relatively thick slices of ham that were cooked and very, very salty. Don't get me wrong, I like salt and I like thick chunks of ham, but that's not what prosciutto is. There was nothing delicate (or special, really) about this ham.\\n\\nThen there was the brie. Or the lack thereof. Brie is one of my favorite cheeses, so I was expecting a decent amount of brie. Not only was there barely any at all when I opened the sandwich, but it was so melted that what little there was was almost invisible. The brie was kind of the selling point of the sandwich, the reason I ordered it, and its nonexistence saddened me. Plus, the salty ham took over the flavor to the point that I could barely detect any brie in any given bite, even if I only took a tiny bit of the ham.\\n\\nIt was a good sandwich overall. The pesto mixture inside was pretty tasty. And the also tasty French roll was a good balance between soft and crunchy. The sandwich just was not what I thought I was ordering.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice and friendly, but slow, and we waited for quite a while to get water refills and our check. She said they were busier than they usually were, but it still felt like there was a lot of downtime with nothing happening at any of the tables.\\n\\nIn closing, I actually would go again, but not anytime soon, and now I know not to trust the menu descriptions.\\n\\n(Last but not least: A $12 dinner sandwich that comes with Ruffles? Really? At least the tomatoes and onions were fresh.)"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I cant even begin to describe!

We followed with individual good-size portion of the spinach frittata, and three delicious scoops: zucchini and corn ( I think it was the guests favorite as little was left.) My favorites are the refreshing lacinato and kale and celery root. We also had bite-size savories of the yummy pretzel braids and cheddar biscuits. Finally, deserts of scrumptious chocolate almond bon bon and lemon cornmeal cake added a lovely finish.

It was early evening, 5:30ish after a football game at Boston College.  We were seated promptly and began our journey with Heath (one of the best server experiences I've had in a very long time, by the way, ask for him - he gets it.  He knows about food, about Row 34, about drinks, beer pairings, it was like he was telling us a story throughout our meal) We sampled many items from the menu.  We started with oysters from the raw bar (they are shucking as you are ordering) they have an oyster farm, thus the name of the restaurant and their own oyster, row 34.  A must.  Our favorite.  and please, don't try to empty the liquid from the shell, eat, drink and enjoy the amazing flavors of this oyster.  We tried Island Creek and Aunt Dotty's - they were great as well, fresh and flavorful.  We also sampled a smoked and cured board - amazing, however, I will say, I was not prepared for the sea urchin.  The texture and the flavor - very soft, almost melts in your mouth while seems rather soft and squishy.  Try it.  small amount and go slow.  but try it.  the rest of the board was great! We also tried the ceviche.  Oh, my.  A MUST, just like a row 34 oyster.  And then we tried the lobster roll.  $27 dollars of butter lobster deliciousiness.  OMG.  I've not eaten many lobster rolls in my life, but they make their own brioche bread, which is jammed with butter.  The lobster is buttered.  I can't tell you in words how delicious the lobster roll is.  They are rather small, but they pack a mighty punch, full of flavor.  Oh, my gosh, another must.  Against our better judgement we also sampled some dessert.  I had the butterscotch pudding with crispy rice on top.  Holy smoke, as full as I was, I wanted to lick the glass jar.  Heath told us a great story about the pudding and its history with one of the owners.  Great family story about how the family thought the aunt's recipe was top secret, when she passed away, turns out, the pudding came from the box.  They have taken the pudding to a whole new level.  Another must.  They have a great beer selection and a full bar.  By the time we left, the restaurant was packed inside and out and there was a line.  we loved it so much, we went back on Sunday night for dinner.  Very different experience.  We ate more row 34 oysters, more ceviche, more pudding.  I tried the fish and chips (might skip next time.  Lots of batter, which I removed and ate the fish.  Fries were skinny and delicious.

Depending on your budget it can be a little pricey, but it's well worth what you'll spend. They have an extensive wine list and cocktails including the best red sangria we've had to date. There are a variety of tapas to choose from. We ordered the Grilled Hanger Steak and Chorizo + Sweet-Sour Fig and they were amazing. For our main course we had the Mariscos Paella, which will take a while to make - roughly 45 minutes - because they make it in house but we were rewarded with deliciousness because it was definitely worth the wait.\\n\\nHighly recommend this restaurant~\\n\\n\\nFULL REVIEW:\\nI took my boyfriend out to celebrate his move to this city and we couldn't have been happier celebrating it at Barcelona Wine & Restaurant. \\n\\nWe made reservations and were promptly greeted and seated. I was hoping to be seated inside but was seated outside instead. To my surprise, they had nice cozy blankets at each table for their guest to use to keep warm, along with also having heaters everywhere they could possibly put one without making it look too tacky. So that didn't make it so bad. It gave the dining experience a different feel. \\n\\nImmediately to follow, we were greeted by one of the managers, Sean, who was carrying yet another blanket with him and offered it to us. He introduced himself and welcomed us to the city.\\n\\nWe started off the night with freshly made bread and olive oil and a pitcher of the Red Traditional Sangria, which was probably the best sangria we've ever had so far. Perfectly blended with pineapple juice, rum, brandy, and orange liqueur with their traditional house made syrup crafted with citrus, fresh fruits, and sugar.\\n\\nNext we ordered two tapas:\\nGrilled Hanger Steak\\nDrizzled with Black Truffle Vinaigrette, the steak was cooked perfectly and cut ready to eat. The sauce complemented the steak really well. \\n\\nChorizo + Sweet-Sour Fig\\nA rare combination but surprisingly very good. The first bite was interesting but I found myself really enjoying this dish. It had a unique blend of sour and sweet that didn't overpower each other out. I would highly recommend new customers try it out just to let your taste bud experience something new.\\n\\nFinally the main course: Mariscos Paella.\\nPaella is a popular dish in Spain and it usually consist of rice, herbs, and meats and vegetables of your choice. In our case, we ordered the seafood combination - pawns, mussels, calamari, and clams- without bell peppers - allergies - substituting the clams with chorizo. It took about 45 minutes to make which the server did warn us about because they make it all in house and it's a lengthy process. If you have the time to spare and enjoy your company, I would highly recommend waiting for this meal. \\n\\nIt was beautifully presented and came out really hot, which was perfect because we were sitting outside. It tasted amazing. You could taste all of the flavors burst in your mouth. Unfortunately, they left out the chorizo so we didn't get to try that with it. The server was kind enough to offer to bring some out for us, but we really just enjoyed it as is and didn't need to bother her for some. My only critique of this meal is that the mussels was really small. They were barely there to be eaten. So the next time I go, I would probably substitute that out for something else as well.\\n\\nOverall, it was a great dining experience. The environment was cozy and mixed with a home-like warm feeling. It's a great place for family and friends to eat and have a good time. Service was excellent and super friendly.

It's all very \\"showy.\\"  The manager(?) greets you at the door, a tall leggy brunette takes you to your table, an uber charming waiter goes into all the detail you need about the menu, a baby grand piano and old italian films are conspicuously placed as decor.  The people at adjoining tables who were either: BFFs with the management, shareholders in Strega, or wannabe \\"ballers\\" were giving mad patsies on everyone's backs who seemed important, and there was even the token older man with two young bombshells flanking him at a booth nearby.  I find myself getting a bit uncomfortable with the whole \\"scene\\" that goes along with this kind of bravado, but it was a fun spot to eat.  The food was honestly delicious.  The calamari al fruiti (?) was damn tasty, and my risotto dinner was really good.  The olives and bread were a great touch (and really freaking good ... I'd carb load at this place anyday), and the cannoli at the end of the night was probably the best cannoli I've ever had anywhere.  Hands down.  The only downer, which sort of confirmed/soured my taste of the place, was this little incident we witnessed at the end of the evening.  A busboy / assistant to our waiter was handing over our bag of packed-up-food (portions are huge here!) and we asked him if he could show us a dessert menu.  He turned to our supremely confident waiter and asked if he could bring over a dessert menu, and the waiter basically humiliated him well within earshot.  Essentially, I've got it, do your job, don't get in the way, don't tell me what to do ... to a college kid who was trying to be helpful.  Not classy, and makes a big statement by how everyone treats their fellow staffers.

First visit for me, repeat for everyone else.  Why am I always behind the trends?  Because I'm just not trendy.\\n\\nAnyway, LBB was fine, if uninspiring.  The decor is sparse and clean, but a little lacking in any character for my taste.  They do need to upsize their hood, as it wasn't that busy and yet there was plenty of grease smoke wafting into the dining area.  I was concerned about seating 8 of us, but at 5:15, we were all able to sit together at the bar.\\n\\nBurgers were tasty but a little small for a grown man.  I kept having to supplement with more fries to feel somewhat sated.  That said, the fries were nice and crunchy and I didn't see one insipid, undercooked one in the bag.  And that portion is plentiful.\\n\\nGreat selection of canned beer from around the globe.  Didn't know Stella came in a can.  \\n\\nOne thing I find odd is the menu.  Truffle fries aren't listed, although it's on the window.  $3.75 for a little burger is a little high for a little burger, but is that because the beef is special?  Or the bun organic?  I feel justified spending a little more at Burgerville than BK knowing the beef comes from Oregon Country Beef.  That would be true at LBB, but didn't see that info anywhere.  Cool that there is no garbage though, just compost and can cans.

There are two parks:\\nUniversal Studios\\nand\\nIslands of Adventure\\n\\nI can't really tell what differentiates one park from the other.  But, to get the full experience you really need to buy the ticket to both.  This puts the price well above that of Disney.  (At least at Disney, each park has a well-defined theme and they are very much different parks.)  I suspect they split this into two parks so they can still advertise themselves as cheaper than Disney.  In reality, they are quite a bit more expensive.\\n\\nThere are some fun attractions here.  The Minion ride (Despicable Me) was very good.  The one Harry Potter Ride was very good.  Spider man was \\"OK\\", but the fact that you were in a cartoon (as opposed to live action) took a little away from it for me. I also enjoyed the Terminator 2 show.  Avoid twister.  It looks like very little effort was put into putting it together.\\n\\nFor lunch: We ate at the Classic Monster's Cafe.  The food was actually better than I expected, and I love these old B-movie themed places.  (Disney's Hollywood studio has a similar venue)\\n\\nAt the end of the day my kids were disappointed with the park.  It'll probably be a few years before we return here.\\n\\nThat said: If you can stay on-site, do it!  If you are visiting the parks, then you get a free \\"line jumper\\" pass.  But there is also a ton to do on-site, but outside the park.  Lots of restaurants (Hard Rock, NASCAR Cafe, Margaritaville), lots of shows (Hard Rock Live, Blue Man Group) and shopping.

Cool, dim atmosphere. Bartenders who knew your face, knew your drink, and sometimes knew your dinner selection. You could hold a conversation with the staff and feel \\"at home.\\" It wasn't a pretentious setting at all. But myyyyy how that has changed!\\n\\nFirst, it took way too long for them to reopen. I understand things don't go as planned, but, frankly, it was frustrating how obscenely long it took. Once they did reopen, I was bummed with the changes I found.\\n\\nThere are now \\"games\\" in the back room and on the front patio for young, preppy just-turned-legal-drinking-age-year-olds...you know...the annoying people you go to dive bars to avoid. The bar doesn't offer much. Trivia is no more, there are just two TVs in the main bar (not sure about the back part because that's where the college sophomores hang out), uncomfortable bar stools (way too high for the bar, so you're hunched over most of the time), the bar tables do that awkward cushioned bench on one side and no-back-barstool thing on the other (again, not comfortable at all).\\n\\nThe back hallway leading to the bathrooms has improved immensely. But the bathrooms? Ugh. The stall doors are too wide, so if you use the regular-sized stall, you literally have to squeeze your body next to the toilet to open the door. If your legs aren't covered, plan on getting some nastiness all over your calf. Gross, I know, but their design, not mine.\\n\\nI will say, the food is good, though the selection is very limited (which is nothing new for this location).

Go to Sotto Sotto instead."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Craigie on Main is a stone's throw away from another excellent French-informed restaurant, Hungry Mother, but the feel is very different here. The decor is classy and upscale without being imposing, and will leave you with an impression of the color white, and of course of the stainless steel of the kitchen which is planted firmly in the dining area. Humorously, France stars prominently in the Men's room decor of both restaurants, and it's clear that the chef/owner here thinks that all things masculine and delicious have emanated from that country's hallowed soil.\\n\\n  The cocktail menu deserves special mention: these are some seriously tasty and creative drinks. Barring encyclopedic knowledge of alcohols and spirits, you will not recognize the names of the drinks ingredients, but you can play a game called 'identify the noun' as you browse through a slew of foreign and impossible sounding alcohol names. Rest assured that all of the drinks are delicious, and most will teach you something interesting about spirits that you didn't know before.\\n\\n  Although it's a verbal item only, if the burger is available you should seriously, seriously consider dropping all other plans that you had for ordering off of the menu and eat the burger instead. Try to go early in the night to maximize your chances of being able to eat one of these things. On a scale of \\"mmmmm\\" to \\"my brain has melted\\" the burger hovers somewhere around \\"sexual\\".\\n\\n  The menu changes often. This is a first-rate, James Beard blessed establishment, so most of the time the appetizers are exciting and the entrees are indulgent and delicious. However, they are experimenting back there in the kitchen, and the prices make a dud on the menu all the more painful. I had the smelts, and for $18 dollars it was a plate of expertly fried fish - no more, no less. It could be that it was plated incorrectly, as the small amount of garnish added an important flavor to the dish. However, the mushroom ragout was very nicely done. Just...be ready... If something does not wow you and if you're vocal, but courteous, in expressing your opinion, they may allow you to order something else at no charge.\\n\\n  The servers and runners are numerous and efficient, as is to be expected in a French style gang. The restaurant also understands that servers need to be able to eat the food to know what the hell is going on with the menu, and they allow the servers to bring guests for a meal that is steeply discounted. This is necessary, as any good server will tell you: Henry Ford was right, workers need to be able to buy the products they are helping to produce.\\n\\n  Do not come here with someone who doesn't know or appreciate food. They will complain of small portions. They will harass you about the writing on the menu. They will gawk at the prices and make comments about the blue light special meat deals at the local Stop N' Shop. If your partner is someone who likes to have their food's weight listed right on the menu (16 oz steak!), wait until they are out of town and come here by yourself, checkbook balanced and ready for the hit.\\n\\n  If you're going with a friend, I recommend that you sit at the bar: the full menu is available and you can ask many more questions of the bartender than you will be able to of your server (not that the servers are inattentive, it's just that bartenders are conveniently imprisoned). Also, the diners at the bar are usually of the open and interesting variety and it is a great place to strike up a conversation with a new set of people while enjoying great drinks and a great meal."},{"name":"In a Pickle Breakfast & Lunch","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"One word...awesome.  had their route 66 omelet which was delicious and my wife had their nutella stuffed french toast with strawberries...I had a taste and it was out of this world.

So I'm perhaps a bit harsh because I was expecting more.\\n\\nWe went to Aquitaine during Restaurant Week, Winter 2014.  We arrived around 6:00 PM on a Sunday night and were promptly seated.  We had a reservation, but it didn't look like we needed one.  The restaurant is large, but still cozy and warm.  The service was prompt and very good throughout the entire evening, even after the restaurant filled with guests.\\n\\nThe fresh bread was excellent and tied us over until our three course meal arrived.  We ordered the parmesan and winter herb polenta frites and the salmon tartare for our appetizers.  The polenta frites came out as five thick and large fried rectangles (quite a large appetizer).  It was served with green goddess dressing (a miss, if you ask me... had they served it with a creamy and spicy sauce or dressing, it would have been 10x better).  The salmon tartare was sitting on smoked red onion cr√®me fra√Æche, which was good but didn't give the salmon the flavor it needed.  The pickled cucumbers and lemon emulsion were good and the toast points were fine... the entire dish just needed something more.  More spice, more sour, more bitter... just something.\\n\\nWe both ordered the flat iron steak with the burgundy jus, kona potatoes, garlic spinach and shaved regiano.  Though we both asked for medium rare, one of us got a steak cooked to medium and the other got a steak that was medium rare.  The burgundy jus was fine, the potatoes were good, but the spinach was over-salted and contained quite a bit of garlic.  Beware if you're on a first date!\\n\\nDessert was the best part of the meal.  The buttermilk panna cotta with macerated blueberries was delicious, light, fluffy, and creamy.  It reminded me of the texture of a creme br√ªl√©e but tasted drastically different.  In contrast to that light dessert, we also got the warm almond pound cake with candied orange and burnt sugar ice cream.  The pound cake was incredibly good and the pairing with the ice cream was fantastic.  If you want a classic feel-good dessert and enjoy the taste of almonds, this one was for you.  If you want a lighter but more decadent and sophisticated dessert, go with the panna cotta.\\n\\nOverall, our experience at this Aquitaine was pretty good.  I was unimpressed with the appetizers and entrees but wowed by the desserts, service, and ambiance.  Though I'd never go as far as saying that the food was bad, I will say that it was disappointing.

But it makes the dishes more of an authenticity.\\n\\nAll the food is made completely from scratch.  This, to me, is a plus.  However, it can also be a minus in that it takes a very long time to get the food out to you -- and sometimes it doesn't all come at the same time, since some things take a little longer to make or are made differently.  \\n\\nThe staff is great.  When we were there, we met the chef.  He is actually from Gambia, but the food in West Africa is all pretty similar, so he knows what he's doing.  Actually, the food in Gambia is slightly spicier.

We were all excited to try it because of what people have been saying.  We got to Pok Pok around 8:30pm and was told there would be a 2 hour wait for a party of 6.  So we were told we can order drinks at the bar and some shrimp chips.  My friend sat at the bar to order her drink and the bartender (guy with ponytail) was so rude to her.  He was saying she couldn't sit there and that our table will be setup for us.  Basically, we weren't allowed to sit at the bar, but the way the bartender explained it to us, he was really rude.  The ONLY reason why we stayed was because my friend wanted to eat there so bad and we canceled all our other reservations just to eat there and we would have been screwed if we had to leave and fall in line for other places to eat.\\n\\nWe asked the host for our shrimp chips and it came out like 30 minutes later and for $4.25 with like 6 pieces, I thought this place was a ripoff.  We finally got our drinks.  It wasn't bad.  I ordered the Pok Pok Colada.\\n\\nMy friend was in such disbelief that it would take us 2 hours to get seated, she asked the host if we can be divided to get seated earlier and she said it would be 45 minutes.  Hmmmm...  So an hour later, we finally get seated and we were all together.  This guy comes to our table and asks us what our drink orders were and since we were ready to order, we asked if we can order our food also and he agreed.  While he was entering our order on the computer, the rude/awkward bartender comes out of nowhere and interrupts in the middle of us ordering and cuts that guy off.  So not only did we not finish placing our order, we didn't get our food in the order we wanted because all we were able to order were the wings.  \\n\\nThe wings are so overrated and so salty.  Very disappointed.  We also ordered the pork belly, flank steak (salty), sticky rice, chicken coconut curry with egg noodles (needed salt), eggplant salad and I can't remember what the other girls ordered.

Terramia let me down hard. Of all the places I booked for Restaurant Week, Terramia probably had the best-sounding menu, and with all the glowing reviews on Yelp, how could I go wrong? Hopefully RW Terramia is not representative of regular week Terramia. I am almost sure that it is not, at least in regard to portion size, but I can only review the experience I had, and that one was truly disappointing.\\n\\nI went with a group of friends for dinner yesterday at 8. We were seated promptly and left to look over the RW menu which I had more or less already memorized. Between the four of us we ordered just about every dish on the menu, and they ranged from ok to decent to downright mediocre (nothing was inedible, thankfully). Three of us started with the insalata di mare because the description on the menu, \\"chilled scallops, calamari & shrimp, Sardinian cous cous salad, and guacamole to dip,\\" sounded so interesting. It certainly was interesting, but that is about all I can say about it. Individual components of the dish, such as the  perfectly cooked shrimp and cous cous, worked, but the dish as a whole didn't quite jive. The squid was tough, and the scallop (singular) contained sand, so that certainly didn't help. My boyfriend had the burrata caprese which was completely unremarkable in every way, so let's move on, shall we?\\n\\nOur pasta course was probably the most satisfying of the antipasti, primi, secondi set (does that not confuse anyone else?), but nothing really stood out there either. I had the eggplant raviloli covered in a mint and basil pesto, topped with potato chips (yes, potato chips) and string beans. I love eggplant, but I really couldn't taste it in the ravioli as it was completely overpowered by the pesto. Luckily I like pesto, but I can see someone who is expecting eggplant flavor to be turned off by this dish. The chips were such an odd touch. I'm guessing they were added to provide a bit of crunch to the dish, but why potato chips? To top it off they were soggy, but that is neither here nor there. I got to try the other two pasta options as well, and neither impressed me very much. Of the three, I would probably recommend the bombolotti amatriciana, but that is certainly not an endorsement.\\n\\nAs underwhelming as those other dishes were, nothing could prepare me for the disappointment of my entree. I got the ossobuco d'estate, and it was probably one of the saddest pieces of meat I have ever seen. It was a circle approximately 5 inches in diameter with a two-inch-wide bone inside. I finished the whole thing in less than five bites. It tasted alright, but the meat was a little stringy. At the end of our meal I simply had to ask the waiter if these were the normal-sized dinner portions, and he reluctantly said no. Downsizing dishes during RW is fine, I guess, as long as the dish is good to start with. This one, sadly, was not.\\n\\nFor those of you who've made it all the way through this review (thanks for reading!), I should say that our service was uniformly solid, and the restaurant was great about accommodating my friend who has a severe lactose allergy. He had the trout for dinner, and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We moved onto the Shima Aji Carpaccio, a thinly sliced striped laurel dressed with house made white soy sauce, which was so delicious! the white soy sauce was good enough just to eat by itself. We ordered some Nigiri, I was disappointed with the octopus, kind of stiff. No one does Octopus like Sushi House Hayakawa. We ordered the Jalape√±o roll. don't worry, it's not spicy at all. My favorite part of the evening had to be the plum wine and the raw oysters in Ponzu sauce. Absolutely the most delightful thing ever! I actually give Nakato 4.5 stars, they would have received 5 had the octopus been better."},{"name":"Circa 1926","address":"358 N Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"Came in for lunch, and had a great meatloaf sandwich and simple little steak wtih fries\\nAll was excellent and service was great!\\nWill be coming back for more!!\\nThanks for the great little interlude with my wife\\nDave"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"There was a lineup before it opened!

Very unprofessional. We ordered 2 of the speciality drinks and a Shirley temple. The Shirley temple was so disgusting like how do you mess up on the most simplest drink. Come to find out when I told the waitress she said the sprite was flat & the bartenders knew it was flat.. how do you serve flat soda to customers. Then the bartender made our drinks 1 by 1 when they should have been made together. We waited at least 30 mins until we got our drinks which is crazy when it was barely anybody in the restaurant. A friend of the bartender came in and she got her drink in less than 5 mins. The drinks were ok could have been better. We watched the bartender make our drinks and she put a straw in our drinks to taste the drink then throw the straw away very unprofessional if you ask me. Then we got our food the calamari was very good then my grandma got the crab cakes they were horrible it was way to mushy it looked like tuna that's how mushy it was. Then the bartender came from behind the bar & was smoking hookah with her friend & was on instagram & Snapchat with her friend like really you are on the clock. Oh I forgot to mention the tables are very small big parties cannot fit & the chairs were plastic very cheap plastic like it looked like you will break it if you sat on it.

They make their pizza using Italian-style fire ovens. The Diavola and margherita with pepperoni are two of my favorite pies. The pizza is thin yet rich, everything from the cheese, dough, and other toppings. It's hard to find any flaws when it comes to the food. I would however advise against the Capricciosa. \\n\\nAlthough each pizza costs around $20, the high quality justifies the price, and the pizza comes out in a jiffy. In the main dining room, there are also a ton of ingredients including their signature red peppers. Another element of Antico that keeps me going back is the BYOB portion. What else is better than beer, wine, and yummy pizza?\\n\\nThe final element that can be a hit or miss is the overall layout of the restaurant. When you go during busy hours, expect to hover over tables like hungry vultures. I once almost got into a confrontation over trying to get a table. It's literally a free for all. The fun doesn't stop there. The tables are also communal so it is common to bump elbows with a random stranger while trying to concentrate on the food and your company.

Bothe meals were good but not outstanding. The lobster meat in both dishes was pretty tough and not sweet. Almost like it was not fresh. As others have noted this place is small, you are sitting elbows to elbows with others and the waiters are constantly squeezing behind you and jostling you. The place is noisy and you get the feeling that you are being rushed. Our appetizer came out before the wine was served.

That being said, the dumplings and cashew nut chicken were well prepared and presented. It certainly wasn't the best Thai food available in Atlanta, but it's about what I expected for the location and price.\\n\\nService: I likely would have given this place only 3 stars if it weren't for the excellent service. Our waiter was clearly seasoned and seemed to know what we wanted before we even had to ask. It also appeared that the waiter to table ratio was fairly low, which is certainly a welcomed deviation from the current restaurant norm.   \\n\\nAtmosphere: While passing by, I always thought that there was only one dining room of this restaurant; however, there is actually another separate dining room in the back which they appeared to be using for overflow once the main room had filled. I personally found the tables in the main dining room to be somewhat cramped, with the booths offering a bit more space to spread out. The clientele is typical for the area and comprised of everything from older couples to families with children.\\n\\nPrice: Inexpensive for the quantity and quality of the food. Most Thai entrees are in the $10 range, which includes white rice.\\n\\nOther: I knew Harry & Sons was owned by the same company as nearby Surin of Thailand, but I wasn't expecting the Thai portion of the menus to be exactly same, word for word.

I knew this was gonna be good.\\nThe fresh ingredients cooked in those imported ovens imparted some kind of magic that exceeded my high expectations.  Watching the guys toss the crust I just heard \\"Iiiiiiii neeeeeed yooooourrrr loooooove...  God speeeeed yooooooour looooove...\\" \\nOnly downer... limited beverage choices.  But after I started eating that pizza, I did not care."},{"name":"Chilli Duck Thai Cuisine","address":"829 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is historically important for me: it was the first Bostonian restaurant I've ever eaten in. The evening I moved into Boston for my studies, tired and jetlagged from my transatlantic flight, I was looking for a place to eat close to where I crashed in Back Bay. I needed something quick and tasty that could cheer me up. Chilli Duck was the perfect place for that. The place doesn't look great from outside, granted, and once you go down the little stairs into the dark room it still does not look that welcoming. The ambiance is clearly not a strong minus; probably don't bring your date there.\\nThe food however is great! There are all the Thai dishes you would expect, and a few from other Asian countries as well. And they make it as spicy (or mild) as you like it. My personal favorites are the red curry and the fried rices (they're all good). Last but not least, prices are very reasonable. A great choice!"},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"487 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"I am so obsessed with this place. It is absolutely delicious and healthy, and the environment and staff are so warm and inviting! Please stay open forever- I'm walking-distance!"},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Really inspired innovative menu. The food was exemplary we are from out of town and were so impressed by this restaurant. We were a table of eight and everyone had amazing food, I had the halibut which was superb, my partner had the lamb shank which is the chefs signature dish. Amazing proclaimed by all and apparently the beef was fantastic. The desserts and the wine list was also great. And the sommelier listened attentively to ur host and served us well."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I really want to like this place, the roof deck is glorious in the summer and we've even come in the autumn, where the aft tables have heat lamps.\\n\\nMy first few experiences were similar to the review, ok food, ok booze, service on the crappier side.\\n\\nThe last several times we've tried to come here the service has been beyond horrible.  \\n\\nExperience 1: It was a beautiful day outside and we wanted to enjoy the weather.  We called 5 hours ahead to make a reservation, they seat us upstairs despite wanting to wait for a roof deck, we ask if we can sit and put our names down to sit outside, they say no, we ask if we can get drinks and wait to seat outside, they say no because we've already sat down.  The A/C was up so high everyone in our party was freezing, we ask to move downstairs where it was warmer.  We ask to be seated by the window, figuring it wasn't a problem due to the large number of open tables, they say no and seat us as far away as possible.  On top of it, we were told by the end there was no space on the roof deck for the rest of the night, but as we leave we overhear another group get quoted a time of 30 minutes.  We are not rude, or loud clients.  Customer \\"service\\" here is laughable.\\n\\n2nd Experience: My girlfriend tried to go with a few of her friends, they are told that the roofdeck won't be open until 1030 and they consent to wait.  As they are requesting seating, the hostess tells them they can only sit outside if everyone is eating.  Half the party has already eaten dinner and the other half is starving.  The waitress has to go check with a manager and then they finally consent to seating everyone outside.  Once they get outside, most of the roofdeck is empty.\\n\\nMixed drinks here are slightly above average, beer selection is average, food is subpar to average.\\n\\nPlenty of other restaurants in boston with outdoor seating, maybe not a roofdeck, but lots of patios, with better food, better service and better drinks.  You're better off spending your money with a restaurant that appreciates you for spending your hard earned money."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Been by here many times. The pizza is a must try! Many ingredients are imported from Italy, which is really unique. \\n\\nI had the cheese... just trying to keep it classy, no need to go crazy all the time! You know, sometimes I go crazy but when I come here it's just cheese.\\n\\nIt's so fresh, and baked just right when you go to the place. Family owned too, which is always refreshing. It reminds me of a kind of restaurant you would find in Chicago or New York because of the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend!"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best view in Austin from a coffee shop. They have the best outdoor seating with the best view. Drip coffee is expensive because they charge you for a bottomless though. A ton of excellent pastries & desserts!"},{"name":"Liquid Art House","address":"100 Arlington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to agree with Jill S in that you are totally paying for the location and ambiance of this spot....and not much else.  I recently had my going away party here and we did have a sit down dinner.  We had a group of about 20 and that seemed to totally overwhelm the staff to the point where things were so mixed up that our entire meal ended up being comped.  To be clear, this actually had absolutely nothing to do with our waiter, Bobbi Murphy- he was PHENOMENAL.  So, if you're going to go to LAH, MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR Bobbi as your waiter, especially if you have a large party.  He doesn't take his job lightly and really felt bad about the mix up with the orders that he worked the remainder of the night to ensure our experience was good.\\n\\nBest item on the menu is the mussels.  Your best bet is to go with that and a side of fries.  I also love their cauliflower!"},{"name":"Nando's Metrotown","address":"4820 Kingsway, Unit 340, Metropolis at Metrotown","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Yum! I had the Spicy Cajun sandwich today, and I was not disappointed. The artisanal bun was soft and really, really fresh. The tomato slices were juicy, and the lettuce was nice and crispy. I also really enjoyed the Cajun flavour (although it wasn't even close to being spicy, at least not by my Chillihead standards). I probably would have given this place five stars, if they had just given me more meat on my sandwich. Having larger portions of chicken would have gone a long way to making the sandwich more satisfying. Which brings me to my next point.\\n\\nThe sandwhich was definitely on the smaller side. I'm only 5'2 and it didn't fill me up (gonna have to go grab another meal after this since my stomach is still rumbling). All things considered, I'd buy this sandwich again. Yes, the sandwich is on the pricy side, but honestly? I don't care. It just tasted so damn good. There's something about fresh, good quality ingredients that a Subway sandwhich can't replicate (and I love Subway, don't get me wrong). If you skipped a meal and need something to fill you up, skip this place. If you need a perfect afternoon snack, then this place won't disappoint."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function D(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(O,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-2f2b6e2e"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/21.md","filePath":"people/21.md"}'),G={name:"people/21.md"},V=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
