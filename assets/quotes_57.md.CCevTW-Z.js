We were in town for a wedding that happened to be the day before our anniversary, so we decided to go out for a nice dinner the day we got into town to celebrate early. His friend suggested PCG and I verified it had great Yelp reviews (duh) and we were decided. I made a reservation through Yelp, it was super easy and I got a confirmation email quickly.\\n\\nFirst off, it's pretty cool to me at least going to a restaurant on the 30th floor of a high-rise. And no, I'm not from Nebraska. I live in Phoenix and for the most part, the only high-rises here house offices for giant companies (laaame). We got to the 30th floor, the hostess immediately found our reservation and we were taken back to our table. Just walking to the table, I was already in love with the views. Our reservation was at 8:30 in July, so of course the sun was still up and you could see EVERYTHING. (This turned out to be the PERFECT time to go, because we took our time eating and got to see daylight, the AMAZING sunset, and the city lights when the sun went down.)\\n\\nWe ordered drinks and clam chowder (which was prepared differently than I am used to, but was delicious!), and after that there were so many good options that I was having a hard time deciding. Our server, Ed, was just wonderful. He was so sweet and so very helpful - I have to give him a huge shoutout! He helped me by suggesting the crab cakes, which I had been eyeing on the menu. My boyfriend ordered sirloin. Our food was absolutely delicious! I loved the marbled potatoes, and the green beans with my boyfriend's steak were crisp and so good. We had planned on going to Voodoo Donuts afterwards for something sweet, but Ed asked if we would like to see the dessert menu and we could not resist the S'Mores Tart. It was excellent. After our meal, Ed boxed up our leftovers and offered to validate our parking for us. He was so attentive!\\n\\nOverall, I was really impressed with Portland City Grill. It was definitely a highlight of our trip to Portland!"},{"name":"Crazy Buffet","address":"7038 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I just had dinner yesterdayfrom this restaurant, after comming back home, i had a really bad stomachache, I ate 3 oysters plus all the cooked items, not able to sleep all night because of the stomachache,  very disappointed."},{"name":"Thai Pasta Cuisine","address":"11461 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"A full service place to the food cart, great food, but the pricing is higher than nearby.

Maybe they are just working out the newbie kinks.\\n\\n1st visit: I walk in and there was only one other person in there in line and one barista. I stood there for nearly 60 seconds without any acknowledgement or greeting from the employee. I stood there feeling a little uncomfortable, wondering if they actually wanted me there when they finally said Hello. I then had to wait another 40 seconds for any other interaction.  \\nMaybe they were new at this, so I let it go.\\nOrdered the small latte. Paid, then realized I was charged for a larger size.  I figured I'd just enjoy a little more coffee that day so I did not say anything. \\nReceived my drink and headed out - when I took a sip, it was kind of warm but definitely not hot like coffee should be and I could barely taste any coffee flavor. Due to my lack of time (they were very very slow), I just drank my lukewarm milk and headed to work. *sigh*\\n\\n2nd visit:  Thought I'd give them another try. This time there was one customer being served, one sitting at a table and three employees behind the counter.  \\nAgain, I felt like I had to draw their attention to me to notice I was there, but once they greeted me they were very polite. \\nOrdered a medium sized latte and a pastry..  \\nPaid and then saw one of the barista use his bare finger to distribute my coffee in the portafilter instead of using a leveling too.  This might be okay if one is making coffee at home, but not in a place a business. Blech.\\nLatte arrived more timely than my first visit, but sadly, again...lukewarm milk with barely any coffee aroma or smell. SAD FACE.\\n\\nI wonder if they just make their lattes with very little coffee or if the two baristas just didn't know how to make them properly.  \\n\\nI want them to do well.

It's painfully annoying. I came with a group of seven one Friday night and had a table with two pots. They should do a good job of bringing the correct portions, especially for the first order when people are hungry. But when we order noodles and they keep bringing out one dish at a time, it's ridiculous. We have seven people. Or how about when we put down a bunch of vegetables, yet they only bring one small portion of watercress? They should be happy to bring veggies and noodles over so we fill ourselves up with that instead of the more expensive meat. Oddly enough, they kept asking us if we'd like to order more, which was surprising. If only they gave us the correct portions. At $30 bucks after tax and tip per person, it's a bit pricey and they won't even bring you everything.\\n\\nAs an aside, the overhead fan at our table was not working.

That being said, the renovation of this restaurants interior, menu, and exterior are really nice. It's very classy inside and an enjoyable respite from a busy day of shopping at Disney Springs in the heat. Our server, and hostess were very friendly, attentive and helpful. \\nWe ordered the crab fries for our appetizer and seriously, could have stopped right there and not needed anything else. They were excellent! Fries were perfectly done, smothered just right with a tasty sauce that had a bit of bite. Horseradish perhaps? The crab that the fries were topped off with was so delicious. I kept eating even though I was full, it tasted so good. Definitely enough on the platter for 4 people or more to enjoy. \\nFor our meals we ordered the following: \\nBurger - The burger was wonderful. Great flavor combination with the cheese and toppings, and the burger was cooked \\"well\\" to order without being dry. \\nFried Clam Roll - maybe I just don't like clams... but it was chewy and fatty and I thought the breaded coating was quite bland and uninteresting. Maybe the sandwich would have made a different impression on me had I taken a bite that had a bit of the fried clam, sauce, toppings and bread all together in the mouth, but alas, after tasting a small piece of the breaded clam I was so turned off I couldn't attempt to try more. \\nThankfully the waitress questioned my dissatisfaction, as I don't like to complain. She took notes as to what I didn't like about it, (I assume to share with the kitchen), removed it from our bill, and asked if I'd like to order something else. Luckily, the appetizer was so filling and I was able to have a bit of my daughters burger so replacing it was not necessary. \\nI have one suggestion for the establishment, and that is to rope off all the entrances that are not open or unlocked to the public. When we first walked up to the boat we entered the first entrance we found, and found the doors locked. So we then took the steps upstairs to the deck and still found those doors locked. After finding someone on the deck on a break on his phone we asked if the restaurant was even open. He then told us how to enter. So basically we toured the whole dang boat before getting inside. Once we got to the main entrance it was obvious it WAS the main entrance, but unless you walk from that end of the boat first, you do not see it and enter the first obvious entryway. It was so hot and we were weary by the time we got seated. We weren't the only people to make this mistake, as I saw others doing the same thing. \\nAnyway, we enjoyed our meal for the most part and enjoyed the relaxed ambiance and great service."},{"name":"Hararu Hibachi & Sushi","address":"1577 Holt Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Sushi is fantastic!

I got the hot lobster roll, and I was probably full for the remainder of the day. It was filled to the brim with lobster with butter EVERYWHERE. It felt like they dunked the roll in butter and then held the hinge part of the roll in the butter for an extra few seconds, making it well-saturated. My sandwich fell apart towards the end, but nothing a fork can't handle. On the side was a huge pile of fries - just a heads up, these fries aren't crispy, in fact they're a little soft, but that's ok because I ate them anyway. My waitress recommended the Tr√∂egs Hopback (beer), which was a slightly bitter (or should I say BUTTER in this case) and complimented the sweetness of the lobster.\\n\\nOverall, 4.5 because my lobster roll was swimming in butter, but I guess a little extra butter never hurt anyone."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely love going for happy hour.

Okay, fine, I guess. My major problem was with the side of pulled chicken, which looked (and tasted, I imagine) like fancy chunky cat food, which is to say... pretty gross. It was also a tiny portion for the price. I don't know what went wrong here, because I used to LOVE their pulled chicken.

We had intended to have brunch here, but it didn't work out.  Alan called this evening and was advised that they don't take reservations, but to come down and expect a 45 minute to an hour and a half wait.  We left around 6:15PM and parked a block or so away, arriving about 6:30.  We walked over and put our name on the list and were told it would be a 45 minute wait.  No problem.  We went outside and saw there was an empty table and asked the server who was out there if we could sit while we were waiting.  He said we could, temporarily, but shortly after that the woman who was maintaining the list came out and explained that she was going to be seating that table so we got up.  Next thing we know, the man we'd been talking to asked if we'd like to sit at the newly vacated outside table next to where we'd been sitting.  Would we?!  It was a lovely night, cooling down after a warm day, but still comfortably warm.\\n\\nThe man who became our server oriented us to the menu and to how they serve the dishes family style, to be shared.  We started w/ the small plates and ordered bread and butter, grilled Spanish octopus and Low Country hush puppies to share.  I ordered an apple brined pork chop and Alan ordered fish tacos made w/ halibut.  We ordered a side of rainbow chard and kale cooked w/ shallots and pine nuts.  The bread and butter came out first, then the hush puppies and the octopus.  The bread was excellent and the hush puppies were fabulous, large and hot from the fryer, served w/ jalapeno butter.  There were 3 of them, so we each took one and split the third.  Alan cut up the octopus.  He took a few bites and found it a little salty, probably from the olives it had been cooked w/.  Not too salty for most people, but for him it was, so I ate the rest.  It was tender and flavorful.\\n\\nThe pork chop came out first, plated atop a pancake-like corn cake.  Both were tasty, the corn cake a pleasant surprise, as it hadn't been mentioned on the menu.  The side of chard and kale was brought out at the same time.  We split that and it was very good.  I gave Alan a couple of bites of the pork chop and several of the corn cake.  He liked the corn cake a bunch and found the pork chop a tad salty.  His tacos came out and looked gorgeous.  He really enjoyed them.

We ordered a special roll, sushi boat, chop scallop roll and a tuna tantaki salad. The salad came on the table with sesame seeds in the dressing so i requested to have the dressing changed. They didn't have much to choose from so i gave the spicy one a try. Wasn't so happy with that. The special roll also had sesame seed on it too. By then I had no more patience to wait for them to change the order for me so my bf just ate it for me. \\n\\nWe spent about 80.00 that night and felt it wasn't so worth it.

So much for making an impression huh?!?! I thought it would be nice to check out the view and from reading the yelp reviews and seeing my fellow yelpers pics I was excited. \\n\\nGot on open table and booked a table requested a booth with a view. From what I saw it seems they only have tables by the windows and the booths away from the views. The restaurant was very dimly lit to start. Hostess greeted us with a smile we were a tad early. I asked her for a table with a nice view which she failed to notice from the open table reservation notes. I then told her we had no problem waiting in the bat for a good table the opens up with a nice view.  She said ok and the told us to hang out, so we went to the bar. \\n\\nSpent about 10mins standing and waiting at the bar top and nobody helped us, they walked by us like five times not as much as a smile or a \\"I will be with you in a second.\\" NADA... POS BAR!!! \\n\\nSo the hostess finds us at the bar empty handed and says I got your table ready for you, it's got a nice view too.... She guides us through the restaurant parading us pass all these wonderful tables looking over Portland and stops us two tables short of the kitchen... WTF LADY!!\\n\\nWe spent all day hiking and a 9 mi bike ride was tired, so f it no time to complain I was hungry and agitated. \\n\\nFirst thing I ordered was two shots or don Julio reposado they had casadorez and a dirty martini xtra dirty, also orders the kung pao calamari. \\n\\nCalamari was slamming, it had the right amount of spice and was fried but not all the way, just enough crispy was and the sweat heat I loved it and would order it again, but it did leave a real fishy taste in my mouth about half way through which made me quit eating it, this appetizer was definitely the right portion and way more than the two of us could finish. It's definitely ideal for a party of four. \\n\\nNext is the inspiration of me writing this review I ordered a rack of lamb, I don't remember what it came with as I was extremely disappointed with it. I asked for it well done, I know you can eat this to taste but I like my meat cooked and diarrhea free if you catch my drift. \\n\\nAnyhow my lamb came out pinker than a baboons behind. I should have through a fit and sent it back right then and there and got up and walked out. \\n\\nNot only did I have to sit and this caca of a table right next to the kitchen; table 11, and listen to all the waiters whine about their lack of tips and what they did last night and what was going on that night after work and heard a bunch of cursing not that I minded as I'm pretty foul mouthed my self, but you get the gist of it oh!!!! and there was another annoying woman/manager I assume because  she was in a nice gray mini as opposed to a uniform like the others but God her voice was so loud and nerve wrecking like my god STFU I'm trying to eat lady and enjoy my expensive ass dinner and I don't care that Paco owes you a favor because your running food for him... You a manager that's what you do help, and why your pissed because your day off request didn't get honored... Who cares besides you woman!!!\\n\\nAny how back to my pink lamb.... Which on the edges was ok juicy and tasted somewhat ok but less that a third of an inch deep the pink set in to almost bloody red, and that lamb after taste when raw is horrid to me, I can taste the ferrous content in the meat the dang thing was probably a minute away from being rare. I don't know how you can mess up well done and I was so looking forward to this till I tasted the thing. \\n\\nBottom line Portland city grill is over rated and not worth the price... It's ok to go get a drink, mind you that there is a noticeable odor you can smell walking from table 10 or 11 along the windows and into the bar area, just for the views and to snap a selfie or two  but other than that.... F it, just got to tasty and sons....

We waited about 20-30 minutes, but we planned for that, so for those short on time, this wouldn't be a good place. You enter and order at the register before finding a table. The seating is free for all once you've ordered, so depending on how busy it is you may end up waiting for a table. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, and heating for the outdoor seats.\\n\\nBeing the first time, I went with what they're known for: the Reggie Deluxe. Fresh homemade biscuit, fried chicken, thick cut bacon, cheese, fried egg and gravy. I went with four other dudes and we split an order of the hash with steak. The chicken had a great flavor and was pretty tender and moist. The gravy was rich and flavorful, and the biscuit was nice and fluffy. I ate using fork and knife as the whole biscuit is quite a mouthful to try eat like a sandwich. Altogether, a great and filing biscuit full of flavor. The hash with steak was just enough to round out a delicious brunch. Topped it off with Stumptown coffee."},{"name":"Cork & Fork","address":"5180 S Conway Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I never write reviews like this, because I hate overhyping, but here goes. IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 10 STARS I WOULD!! My wife and I were looking for a dog-friendly Sunday brunch and found this place. I had the Eggs Shakshuka and she had the Brunch Burger. Both were INCREDIBLE! The Eggs Shakshuka is a fascinating combination of poached eggs, Israeli zucchini polenta, and sausage. The brunch burger was cooked to perfection with a unique, spicy bacon jam. I cannot adequately express in words how delicious everything was! And no, we were not high.\\n\\nWe went back a week later on a Saturday and had the calamari as an app, I had the Cali BLT and she had a fancy salad. Again it was all unbelievably delectable. The calamari was unlike any calamari I've ever had. It still had an essence of the sea in it, and when I asked the owner about it, he explained that it is fresh, never frozen. Everything they serve is fresh (never frozen) and locally sourced. As an aside, the owner is a very friendly (and obviously gifted) restaurateur. \\n\\nAnyway, like I said I never rave about any place in my reviews, but I have to make an exception here.

I wasted a LOT of time and paid to park in the garage across the street from the place and they put aside a tiny slice of cake. It blew my mind after the conversation I had earlier in the morning that this was confused and they thought I meant to put a tiny sliver of cake aside for me.

Not much of a surprise since TOP FLR has the same parking deal - but I always was able to find a space (Maybe because most people dont know its there).

I went with my best foodie buddy and we arrived around 8:30 and sat at the bar.  This place is NOT where you want to go if you desire a full meal since its just small plates - just my opinion.  It's different from TOP FLR because its menu is more about the Cocktails, and boy are they good!  The waiters are very patient, knowledgeable, professional and attentive.  I recommend the Horse Neck, La Paloma and the Jersey Devil.\\n\\nWe went on a Wednesday night and the place was jumping by 9:30pm - they had a Live Band that went on around 10pm and the people continued to come in.

For an appetizer, we were able to pick three small bites (a great deal for only $9) so we got the procuitto and melon, steak bites, and beet salad.  While all three items came looking beautifully assembled and looking mouthwatering, all were lacking in taste to some extent or another (the beef was too salty, the beets were smothered in blue cheese, and the procuitto and melon were completely tasteless....no idea how).  Our entrees weren't much better with my fiancee's obviously pre-made lasagna severely lacking in sauce and looking very greasy; my fish was very fresh and beautifully plated but again, severely lacking in any flavor (I had to ask for a lemon slice to add a hint of it myself).  For dessert we had the mascarpone cheesecake which was a no-bake version concocted of what tasted like cream cheese, mascarpone, and honey thown in a ramkin and refrigerated until solid.\\n\\nHonestly this is a very beautiful restaurant.  The service was excellent and its clear that someone was making an effort in the kitchen with the plating of the food.

One of those two is probably true. Started with drinks and apps in the bar, everything on happy hour menu is reasonably priced for sure. The Kung Pao Calimari was cooked well but could've used some citrus or an additional flavor, as the Kung Pao sauce was not too different from something you'd find in any cheap Chinese restaurant.

My girlfriend ordered the wagyu sirloin medium-rare, but it was a purple rare (edible, just not quite right).

When you enter to your left you will see a reach in freezer where you can help yourselves to a pint of their flavors to take home and enjoy later -- very nice, plus if you return the container they discount the next purchase...there is a sign on the freezer door explaining this program.  Just to your right you will see the counter.  Abover the counter are a list of flavors.  On the counter there are a couple signs offering sauces - rice mellow, chocolate/hot fudge and there are also dishes with other toppings - sprinkles, mochi, etc....  They offer tastings of any flavor - which is nice, one because you don't have to commit too quickly to a flavor, and the staff is very friendly and helpful - which is a positive.  I tasted the dark and stormy - nice ginger flavor and I also tasted the thai peanut  - mildly spicy and has peanut pieces - was explained that much less mild peanut flavor than the peanut butter option.  \\nI ended up selecting the salted caramel, based on a friends recommendation, and to switch things up I opted for Cardamom-Pistachio.  Salty caramel was very soft and silky smooth.  The Cardamom-Pistachio was much firmer with chunks of pistachios -- would have liked a much stronger pistachio flavor... I love chai and similar spices so I was hoping for an upfront cardamom.  \\nThey have several dozen flavors - so there are lots to sample and lots of reason to return and try to find a new favorite.  If you really like it you can purchase a pint - i really like that they have pre-packed pints - easy and convenient. \\n\\nI also knew before going that they sell a vegan donut - by sabertooth bakery, a one person operation based in JP who sells their baked goods via special order or at a few retail locations.

It really couldn't have come together any better. We started off the day knowing that we only had limited time in Boston before our flight, so we figured we'd eat an early dinner. We were determined to eat at a great seafood place. That morning, for no good reason, we declared the day to be the \\"Day of Lobster\\". It started off with a lobster omelet at the hotel and went from there. Neptune was to top it off.\\n\\nNot knowing anything about Boston and having no leads, we turned to Yelp, which in turn pointed us to Neptune. We did some touristy things to kill some time and then made our way to the restaurant around 3:30. When we got there we were surprised to find a line out the door already. Yikes. We put in our name and she said the wait would be around an hour and 45 minutes. Yikes again. But we were determined. We walked around what seemed to be Boston's Little Italy, had some food from Mike's Pastries (which also had a huge line), played in a children's playground... and realized that it only killed about an hour. We went back to see where we stood, and it didn't look great. We explained our flight situation and she told us to hang around and she'd absolutely have us seated within a half hour. Totally accommodating. \\n\\nThirty minutes later, we got a call and we were sitting in Neptune. The place is really small, which is the reason why the waits are so outrageous. The entire left side of the place is a bar and the right side is about 7 tables. It seems a bit cramped, but you can deal with it because it's all very clean and pretty. Our waitress, Kristin, also doubled as the hostess. She was very busy, but our service never suffered. First we ordered some oysters because it seemed like it would be a crime not to, and of course we ordered the lobster cocktail to continue with the theme of the day. The lobster was good. I'm not big on oysters, but the two I had were alright. I liked being able to order different varieties and compare them all.\\n\\nFor entr√©es , we were all looking at lobster. Most of us were eying the lobster roll, however, and that seemed like a wasted opportunity since there were plenty of other interesting dishes on the menu. We told our waitress about our Day of Lobster idea and she suggested 3 lobster entr√©es and an oyster appetizer for all of us to share. We ended up with a lobster salad, the grilled lobster, a lobster roll and the Neptunes on piggyback. She also helped us order a bottle of wine that goes well with lobster.\\n\\nEverything we had was delicious, but the lobster roll was everyone favorite. The flavors are very simple and traditional, but damn is it good. I could eat that roll soaked in butter and lobster juice alone everyday. I don't have grilled lobster all that often, so that was a nice change of pace and the salad was fresh and was a nice element. Overall, everything was great and it all came together nicely. All of us were incredibly happy with how the meal turned out."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I liked it.

If the place was busy i would understand but the place was completely dead inside. Got the cheese curd appetizer and halfway through eating it discovered mold on some of the cheese shredded on top and sent it back. An employee came over and assured us that it was a piece of bleu cheese that fell on the plate but im pretty sure that was an excuse because the molded cheese was shredded.

The dishes here range from Taiwanese (i.e. oyster pancakes) to Shanghainese (drunken chicken) to Thai (green curry) to Cantonese (dim sum) to Malay (Roti Canai) and the list probably goes on. If you don't have a clue what type of \\"Asian\\" you'd like and you're in Chinatown, this is a safe bet. Their menu is GINORMOUS!!!\\n\\nWe were here for dim sum on a Saturday morning around 11:30. Hardly any customers at the time and seating was immediate. We ordered off the main menu and the dim sum menu. \\n\\nI can tell you as someone who grew up in Hong Kong eating dimsum that the vast majority of dimsum we ordered came frozen...not home made, not fresh, but probably freshly steamed. The shrimp dumplings had a gummy chewy skin, but the shrimp inside had good flavor. The shiu mai was small and unmemorable. The shrimp wrapped in rice sheets were good, though again the rice sheets were sticky and gummy. The chicken feet tasted authentic, but needed another 2 hours in the steamer. \\n\\nThe vegetable green curry was tasty and filled with vegetables, but the sauce itself was watery at best (and rice is additional!) The Malay special stir-fried veggies (Ong choy) were delicious though! A little spicy, very flavorful...yum! We also ordered a fabulous fried noodle topped with shrimp and vegetable gravy that was delicious. \\n\\nI might have given it just 2 stars if I just tasted the dimsum, but the other dishes we ordered were great, so 3 is fair.

I sat by the window and had a nice view of a drug dealer doing his business.\\n\\nWe arrived about 7:45pm and this place was quite busy. We noticed everyone in the place was drinking. Service was pretty slow but it was busy, our server was nice but seemed like the only one working.\\n\\nI wanted to try the brisket but my guest didn't like that so we decided to order the fried chicken and a full rack of ribs with a couple of sides. I enjoyed a beer while we waited.\\n\\nAfter almost an hour, the food made it to our table. The ribs were lukewarm, the chicken was hot.  \\n\\nFirst the chicken, it was done in something like a beer batter and it was deboned. I liked the chicken and the gravy, the gravy had something like curcumin in it which I liked, but my guest didn't.\\n\\nI was  looking forward to trying the ribs but they were probably the worst restaurant ribs I had ever had. We had decided on a full rack which did not seem to be all that much food. The portions seem small here. I would say half of the rack was edible. The other half was way too dry and quite burnt.\\nIn other words,  we got a half rack. The ok pieces were placed on top of the burnt dry pieces. We were disappointed especially sine a full rack was $25.\\n\\nOur server only came to our table twice after getting our order, one to serve drinks and next to serve the food. Never came back to check on how our food was going.\\n\\nAnyways, after such a long wait we really didn't want to hang around for more drinks. When she came to see if we were done, I told her the ribs were not very good and dry. I pointed out the really dry burnt portions and she said \\"of course the ends would be dry\\". Really? We had left 1/2 of the rack,  she asks if we would like to have it packed. We replied no. She told us she would take it to show the kitchen but never told us what their comments were. To be honest, I would not have served ribs like that to my friends.\\n\\nWe were there to check the place out as a friend's birthday was next week, we were thinking to go there, but not after our experience. If you are intent to go there, don't order the ribs!

We had a blast, well I did anyways!  \\n\\nIt was definitely clearing 100 degrees outside as one of my closest gal pals finally trekked up to the doors of Splash, opening it from complete brightness outside to pretty much complete darkness.  It definitely took a moment to adjust to the lighting difference, but the cool air was a nice welcoming.  \\n\\nI mentioned my name and a pretty girl brought us upstairs to the roof top area where there was a spot designated for me and my guests.  We sat and our waitress brought us drink menus.  I got the Tangy one (I forget the full name) and the Fruit of the Loom.  The Fruit of the Loom was better! And then stuck with Coronas for the remainder of the evening, classy I know.  The drinks menu was expensive but to be expected at a Boston club, beer price was average.  The mixed drinks were $12, but very good and I want to say that bottled beer was $6? Not 100% on that one.\\n\\nAs my friends trickled upstairs to the area I had, we sort of questioned their buffet and asked the waitress.  She mentioned it was back downstairs and we were welcome to it.  The buffet was complimentary with the party, so we had to ask of course!  Our waitress even offered to head downstairs for us and bring us up some items from it.  Score!\\n\\nSo, we sat up there, enjoyed the shade in the heat; it wasn't too bad at all.  We were sort of in a corner with not much of a view except for some other tables and their little 'splash' pool they had which was maybe 6 inches deep.  No one was in it, I don't think people go in it though, that might be weird.\\n\\nOh, more about the food; so we were sitting there and then the buffet really started!  A guy was bringing us plates upon plates of just amazing things to eat, holy moly.  So there was two fish appetizers; tuna and sea bass (which was amazing), pork (eh), a caprese dish, steak tips (my favorite), then there was the buffalo chicken wings beforehand with the jalapeno poppers and mozzarella and mini meatballs. All of it was pretty much really good, and I would love to go back and get more steak tips.\\n\\nThe overall atmosphere outside was alright.  Not much to look at, the SE expressway and some buildings but it was simple and along with the company of friends and some people watching, I didn't mind the lack of actual view.  The brick for the building was nice, I like exposed brick inside places so outside was nice.  There were just a bunch of tents set up along the wall and then the 'splash' pool in the middle with the bar along one corner with a TV that had on NESN once the Sox started.  There was another tent in the other corner.\\n\\nThe bathroom, waaaay too small to be a ladies restroom and their toilets are weird.  Really weird.  I could see that this bathroom would cause major issues on a busy night.  They have like water sprayers and heating on that thing it was like a space ship and I was honestly afraid to go near it never mind hover to pee.  Yeah, lady like but hey ladies, that's something to be aware of when you have to go.\\n\\nWhen we came back down to exit, there were some people at the bar and scattered among the tables.  There were also people in the other room area they had off to the right of the stairs where the DJ seemed to be.  It looked cool, from what I recall; decent music.  I like that house/top 40 kind of stuff, so pretty much anywhere has good tunes to me.\\n\\nOutside, there was a pack of guys; they looked like a European soccer team, I'll take it.  Too bad we were leaving!

The restaurant was busy due to the bruins playing but we were sat within ten minutes. I ordered a blue raspberry hooteraid and two of my friends ordered a pitcher of beer. When their drinks came out and the rest of the drinks arrived I still did not have my hooteraid. Our waitress did not take our food order till after 35 minutes and by that time I still did not have my drink! We tried to get her attention several times but she refused to make eye contact with us. When we finally were able to place our food orders I asked if she knew when my drink would be ready and she said \\" oh right. What did you want again?\\" So she clearly had never put it in.  When I did final get my drink it had almost no alcohol. If I'm paying for a $8 drink it better have a decent amount of alcohol in it otherwise what's the point? Another thirty -forty minutes later we get our food. Four of the people I am with were doing endless wing night, and they all agreed their wings sucked and were much smaller than the last time they had had them. They had freezer burn on them but were hard and disappointing. Another friend got an $8 plate of wings and after eating just half of one she couldn't stomach the rest. Our waitress completely avoided our table to the point where I was stacking all of our dirty plates and other waitresses were coming by to get them. We never got water refills, and every time we would search for our waitress she would be at the table across from us talking to the guys at that table. Because the wings were so bad  and not filling at all someone in my party ordered a burger. He ordered it medium but when it came out it was black and burnt to a crisp. Sides of ranch were never brought over to our table, and when we were finally given silverware ( over an hour into sitting there) it was disgustingly dirty. A pipe above us was leaking so every five minutes we would get dripped on by god knows what. Our visit to hooters should have been 1  1/2 hours tops, Not 3. But the end we were all so fed up with our service and the quality of our food that we called over a manager. The only reason I'm even giving hooters one star is because the manager listened to what we had to say and gave us  1/2 off our bill. Needless to say none of us will ever be going back to hooters.  t was overpriced for freezer burned small portions and very shitty drinks. \\n*also after talking to my friends three people went home and were sick after eating here.

I usually order skinny margaritas whenever we are at a Mexican restaurant, but Garridos' regular margaritas seems to be already skinny :)  However, the food was not good.... first, it took forever for it to come out, and second it was not tastey at all.  I had a cup of tortilla soup and it tasted like it came out of a can with some hot sauce and chicken added to it.  I ordered the oyster and fish BLT taco plate.  The fish taco was alright, but the oyster taco tasted very fishy and that's about the only taste/flavor on that taco plate.  I was excited to see that the rice was green, thinking it was cilantro-lime flavored, but it was absolutely tasteless!  As were the beans.

People rave about this place. I think it is overrated. \\n\\nLet me start by saying that I'm allergic to bivalves, so I cannot eat most items on the menu. But my wife loves seafood, and this restaurant, so we waited to go until Wednesday, when Neptune offers a fish and chips special.\\n\\nI've had fish and chips just about everywhere. The fries were delicious, some of the best I've had anywhere. But the fish, while cooked perfectly, was so chewy and stringy that I could not finish most of it. Literally, I could not chew it to bits enough so I could swallow it. I later learned that they use skate wing for the fish and chips. There is a reason every other restaurant uses a basic flaky white fish, like haddock or cod, and the skate ruined the meal.\\n\\nI encouraged my wife to try something other than the lobster roll (she usually gets the lobster roll), which I understand to be quite good, but which is certainly not worth the $27 price tag. She tried and loved the vitello tonnato sandwich. Pulled veal and raw tuna created a great, unique sandwich. She also loved the oysters she tried. \\n\\nDespite any thoughts about the food, I just do not understand the fuss. We went on a Wednesday night, there was a 45 minute wait for 2 people, they ask you to leave the restaurant because it is so small you can't wait, and after we were finally seated, we were packed into a space for one at the bar, and right next to the door.

I made reservations, which was a great idea, because it was packed when we walked in.  At first, the hostess wanted to seat us in the bar, at a high-top table.  Nope.  That won't work for me.  I made reservations so I wouldn't have to do that!  Fortunately, there was a table available in the dining room, and she seated us there.  (The patio looked fantastic, and she did offer us a table out there, but at 107 degrees, even with ample misters, that just didn't sound appealing.) So points for seating us immediately when we walked in.\\n\\nBut then we just sat.  And sat.  And waited for our server.  After about 10 minutes, she finally made an appearance.  She didn't even apologize for her delay.  Hmm...not looking so good.  We ordered our first round of drinks, as well as guacamole and the shrimp tostadas.  My margarita was very refreshing, and husband's beer was well-chilled.  The food came out quickly.  The guacamole was definitely nothing to write home about.  Just a dollop of very smooth avocado, with a bit of pico on the top.  I like my guac a little bit chunkier.  Shrimp tostadas were not what I expected, but yummy nevertheless.  Don't order for a meal!  You will still be hungry!  4 small round chips, each one with one shrimp and the rest of the fixins'.  \\n\\nWe like to try out a lot of things at new restaurants, so we ordered our next round:  the roasted pork quesadillas.  Also, husband decided to check in on Facebook, and found that there was a \\"deal\\", so he showed it to our server, and we got a small free queso.  The queso was just \\"meh\\".  I wouldn't pay for it. The pork quesadillas showed up, and they looked like they were just swimming in grease.  Ugh.  Or so I thought.  Appearances can be deceiving.  They were amazing.  In spite of, or maybe even because of, the grease!  Best thing we had all night!\\n\\nNext, we decided to try out the tacos.  Husband ordered a pork carnitas, and the snapper BLT.  The server said the coffee-marinated steak was her favorite, so I decided to give that a try.  I didn't try the snapper, but husband said the fish was a little dry, and didn't give it rave reviews.  He liked the idea, but not the execution.  The steak taco was pretty good, though the steak was just a bit chewy.  Again, the pork was awesome.  I had one bite, and decided we needed another to share, so ordered up one more.  Garrido's does a great job with pork.  I really wanted to try the enchiladas with the habanero cream sauce, but since they don't come a la carte, that will have to be saved for the next visit.  \\n\\nOverall, the service was disappointing.  And the prices were a little high for what we got.  But they do have some high rent to cover, and it was a great atmosphere, so I'll forgive them the high prices. The high notes were definitely the pork quesadillas, and the pork carnitas tacos. I would have given them an additional star if the service weren't so poor."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The red sauce will light your mouth on fire.

In fact, as a dining experience, I much prefer Little Bird's casual nature. And actually, a few of the dishes as well.\\n\\nOn my first go, I got the snail tortellini. If you're into escargot, this is a must order. I also did the bone marrow with chorizo and calamari, which was served on a squid ink flatbread, and the instructions were to scrape everything onto the bread and eat it like a pizza. Impressively unique in presentation and in flavor, and how often do you really use the word \\"unique\\" to describe food anymore?\\n\\nFor round two, I came craving a burger during late night happy hour. And...what I'm about to say might be sacrilege, so stop reading if you're sensitive: I didn't like it. I kind of actually hated it. It was a little overcooked (medium instead of medium rare), but a medium burger should still be somewhat juicy. This was dry as the Gobi Desert. Combined with a super-dry ciabatta bun and very little toppings, it didn't work.\\n\\nHowever, the saving grace was twofold: the fries, which were completely addictive. And the charcuterie board, which was one of the best I've had in my life. It was a large portion with a huge, balanced variety of meats. Not only that, but there were a couple very unique items on that board: caramelized pork belly, a soft scotch egg...and my favorite of the night, foie gras brulee with apricot jam. Ridiculously decadent. For the size of the board, $20 seemed like a steal. I love that they don't shrink it down for happy hour!\\n\\nSummary: Don't get the burger, do get everything else.

It was sweet to be able to go check out the brewery and then grab a lobster roll. The picnic area was busy but enough room for everyone to sit and share a table! A bonus was there were tents outside for shade. We came at night but it was still nice knowing it was there for the day time. I had never had a lobster roll before so decided to go for the Connecticut roll. (Aka: hot buttery orgasmical delightfulness). They had a special going on where the first roll was $12 and the second was $9 (sweeeet!) My friend was carrying the food to our table and tripped over a block of wood (for a fan to sit on) and her lobster roll went flying. Devastating for 1) #lobsterrolltragedy and for 2) having to go re-order and pay again. (Obviously no fault of Garbo's). The workers were so awesome that when my friend went to pay they told her it was on the house. The customer service in itself will have me be a repeat customer. They didn't have to do that but went out of their way to make sure everyone went home happy. My only regret was how quickly I ate it....yummmm. Will be back again!

For the one-off cupcake after lunch they're great, but I don't think I'd place a large order again. I ordered five dozen cupcakes, each dozen being a different flavor & icing combination. One dozen had the wrong icing, and the flavor for one of the dozens was replaced with a different flavor. We also ordered a special item and provided photos to illustrate what we were looking for. The delivered product was edible but not pretty, and not at all what we were hoping for. In the end I think they should have admitted defeat and communicated that to us so that we could alter our order.

What a place appropriate for Austin!\\n\\nTheir menu covers waffles, coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, tacos, and salads.  Seriously, all breakfast places should have a sampler dish available!  Their waffles looked pretty good so I ordered an Original Leige Waffle with chocolate chips mixed in and topped with bananas and strawberries.  Their online menu has a list of different waffles, but you really just make your own.  First impression when it came out was that it looks kind of small.  Don't worry, it isn't.  I definitely had to work my way through to the end and the fruit tasted fresh.  The waffle was a bit dense for me, so I might consider having the bananas mixed in or topped with a sauce the next time I get it.  The sandwiches also looked pretty good too, and you also get $2 off a breakfast sandwich when you check in!  Missed out on their Gelato Pops too, so another excuse to come back.\\n\\nThere's only one or two cooks, so the food will take a while to come out.  Make sure you're not in a rush.

We requested they take it back and provide a bottle of the other, by-the-glass wine.  The service manage came over and did take it off the bill but did so begrudgingly and after a lecture.  It was really undrinkable and even though when you order a bottle, you are accepting the risk, that wine was not as represented.

The bread with it was perfect as were the fries that came with it. I also tried some of the oysters and the shrimp cocktail. All were delicious.\\nMy coworker arrived late that evening and the following day I told her about Neptune Oyster and she got so jealous that we had to go that night. So I went two nights in a row!! We started with oysters and shrimp cocktail. Then for mains she had the scallops and I had the Cioppino. Both were amazing!\\nThe space is charming. A small gem with good service and amazing food.

I felt bad having to ask a million questions but at least the guy behind the line could answer them and was personable.  When I told him I don't eat beef, he said that limited my options greatly (which surprised me, because most italian sausages I have had are pork based).  It left me with two choices, a pork sandwich and a chicken philly.  I went for the Philly ATW with Cheeze wiz.  It was a pretty good sandwich.  I would say a fair serving of meat, and the veggies well cooked.  It had the kind of flavor I would expect.  Nothing absolutely amazing, but nothing I wouldn't have again.  Probably the only real negative was that I thought the bun was not quite right.  I dont know why, but the hoagie roll they used seemed more suited for a deli sandwich than a hot sandwich.  \\n\\nI also tried the  fried cheese curds, a deluxe side.  I have to say, I was rather disappointed in them.  When described to me, I had an expectation of something that would taste fresh and different.  I'm pretty sure they were just a food service product.  They were way too garlicy and more breading then they were cheese.  Not feeling satisfied by them I went back and ordered one of the cucumber salads.  It was probably the most unique flavor I had there, but not what I would call a cucumber salad.  It was cool and crisp, but a little overly sweet, because it had a large amount of sweet pickle chips in it.  I don't know if my expectations of what a CucSalad should be are different because it was a favorite dish of a favorite restaurant back home, but this wasn't it.  \\n\\nEven though the food was a-ok two things quickly brought it down, pricing and service.  $7 for a good hearty Philly is not a bad buy at all, even though at that price, this one could have used a little more meat or at least a side.  The thing that killed me was that on top of the $7 philly sides had to be purchased in a combo, or were more expensive.  To create a combo with my cheese curds was an extra $3, and would have been the same price for fries or even chili cheese fries.  This also included a drink.  Ordinarily I would not blink at that, but since the place was fully attached to a bar, I wanted a DRINK which the combo didn't include (understandably).  If I wanted to order JUST the side, it would have been $4.  Their strategy is just a little off.  \\n\\nThe thing that got me though was when I wanted to order the cucumber salad, the bar was holding my card.  I told the waitress that I was going to go over to order one (she had asked if I wanted another drink and I told her after I got back from ordering the salad, to which she said OK and walked away).  I went to order, and was told because I was only ordering the Cucumber salad it would only be $3.00 (on the menu it appears to be non-premium, it would have been $2 if I had bought it as a combo, again, kind of backwards strategy).  When I realized my card was being held on the other side, I asked if I could run and get it and found out I could order on that side, so I did (slightly irked at the fact it could have saved me time and having to reboot my laptop since I was working and not going to leave it unattended).  When I went to get rung out, low and I was charged $4 for it.  When I pointed it out all I got was a \\"Sorry\\" with no attempt to fix it.  I've gotten past the point of wasting time arguing over $1.  I have found it more worth my time to just not go back.

Looking forward to a nice bowl of Pho, and then to be surprised with the smell of tears and desperation. I will be explaining my story in chapters.\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 \\"false hope\\":\\n           The scene in the restaurant looked like something out of a horror film, as the manager failed to control his employees(who all looked to be younger than 15). As you walk toward the hostess table your hope is manipulated like Kevin in Home Alone. Waiting for a staff member to give me some sense of recognition I could feel the hairs on my head turn gray. Twenty minutes go by with multiple attempts at getting someone's attention, all failed. Soon a line had formed and people were waiting outside in 20 degree weather. Finally, after 40 minutes a hostess had finally seated us, and about half of the line that was there before had left the restaurant. Once seated I had known that my mistake had just begun. \\n\\nCHAPTER 2 \\"Mans not hot\\"\\nOnce seated I was about to let go of my troubled past, but was soon treated by the clown form the movie IT. This man who to my belief should have been in a K POP video was serving me Pho. Of course I may have been judging a book by its cover, but as soon as we order I knew that all of my observation had been true. As our waited had not studied the menu and we needed to repeat our order four times until he finally decide to write it down. But let's not be to harsh he did bring us our beers...warm.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 \\"Pho is dish best served cold\\":\\nThe title of this Chapter pays tribute to all those who got stomach poisoning that night. Finally as orders were in and our long awaited food had finally been served we were starving. As you put your face close to the soup you believe that the soups hot steam will calm you down after a long cold day. Unfortunately like everything else leading up to this point, the Pho was harsh and cold. Also won't forget to mention the fact that the soup smelt like a Vietnamese whore house. As our K POP waiter assured to us that the soup was made seconds ago, I decided to dig in(knowing that I was to lazy to redo this process at another restaurant near by). Little did I know that the Pho would keep me up all night in the bathroom. \\n\\nCHAPTER 4 \\"Reflection\\":\\nAs I lay here on the toilet(where I've been for the last 2 hours) the weight of my misfortune now lays in the Boston sewage system.

The \\"magic\\" of this place clearly exceeded the reality of the experience. At least for me. We had 1 entre, 3 appetizers, 2 drinks and a salad for almost $160. Between the 2 of us THAT is what it took to fill  us up. We even tried sharing appetizers and the entre in order to keep cost down. Yeah that didn't work. The food wasn't bad, don't get me wrong but it was nothing to get excited about. However, the staff was prompt and friendly and that is why I'm rating this a 3 star instead of a 1 or 2. You're paying for the \\"view\\" here. Let's just be honest.\\n\\nUpdate: \\nDarby from PCG contacted me quickly and was extremely helpful and understanding towards our situation and I changed this review to 4 stars because of his exceptional customer service. He really cares about the business and it's customers. I will share this experience with everyone I know.

Not completely let down, but also not over the moon with the dim sum experience. We came here to have dim sum for dinner - but unless you explicitly ask they won't give you the dim sum menu! \\n\\nTo break it down by dish: \\n\\nPorridge with preserved egg and pork (2/5): this fragrant dish is one of my favorite porridges, but I was quite disappointed with Bubor Cha Cha's version. It had a subtle preserved egg taste, but I wish it was stronger. There really is almost no preserved egg or pork in the dish, which made it less worthwhile. Would not order again. \\n\\nShrimp dumplings (4/5): one of my favorite dim sum dishes, and I was very happy with the tender and flavorful shrimp here! The shrimp dumplings were made very well. Would order again. \\n\\nSteamed bun with BBQ pork (4/5): wow, another great dish! Do note that the sauce makes the pork very sweet, but I personally found the combination of sweet and savory to be just right. Would highly recommend. \\n\\nTofu skin rolls with pork in brown sauce (1/5): unfortunately, this wasn't the dish for me. The tofu skin was decent, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the pork. Overall, the dish was very greasy and too filling (not really in a good way). \\n\\nSteamed beef rice noodles (2/5): I love rice noodles, but this really isn't my favorite. The dish was drenched in vinegar and soy sauce, and to be honest I couldn't exactly identify the meat as beef. This is a hard dish to make well and I've had better. \\n\\nMolten salted egg custard bun (5/5): YUM! This was by far my favorite of the night, and the reason I would come back. The buns are steamed perfectly - the bread has a very lightly sweetened flavor, and the egg custard was a beautiful liquid with the perfect egg taste and texture. Absolutely loved this, I consider it a must order! \\n\\nWould I come here again? Yes, I would. The dim sum wasn't extravagantly pricey, and there are some good options. That said, there weren't a lot of options for dim sum, especially as some were sold out by dinnertime (understandable). The service was not outstanding, but not terrible - it took some movement on our end to get the servers to notice us, but it wasn't a hassle. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated in a very typical Chinese manner, and there is a wide variety of seating for every type of group.

I stopped in to purchase the Mustafar yesterday, expecting to pay $22.00 yes but also to get a overly large pie I could perhaps eat for a few days, however, I paid the same price and found on my way out the door that the location has downsized their pizza sizes and yet sneakily kept their prices the same.

The menu is thoroughly modern, but the beautiful red-brick building and plush little patio evoke a nostalgia that is perfect for the neighborhood. Over a springtime lunch of Spanish tapas, I got to know and love this stylish lounge.\\n\\nAs a Dine Originals destination, it was worth more than my ten dollars. We were a two-top on a Tuesday morning, no reservation needed, and we chose our own seats. Our (very) comfortable booth lined one wall and played double-duty by complimenting diners with attractive recessed uplights. Everything was stylish and chic, even the flat-screens played only vintage movies or Julia Child.\\n\\nMy date and I split our sandwiches and sides, and ordered a salad as well. The ensalada verde was fresh and dramatic, with bites of dried figs and creamy goat cheese in a savory bacon vinaigrette. I'll admit I passed the spiced almonds to my husband (he loved them) but it was delightful. My sopa de tomate was sweet, but didn't really compare to my husband's patatas bravas or the addictive house-made sourdough. His twice-fried potatoes were just perfection, and the spicy aioli was as pretty on the plate as it was on the palette.\\n\\nHere's where the moral comes in: men, trust your lady's instincts! My husband wanted the jamon serrano, but knowing him well, I suggested the chorizo link and ordered it myself. Cooked to tasty perfection with caramelized onions, peppers, and melty manchego, it was a much more savory option than the upscale ham and cheese served cold with greens and vinaigrette. When we split our baguette sandwiches in half to share, not only did he have to admit that he preferred the chorizo, but he also found a piece of plastic wrap with his jamon. It's a simple mistake with that kind of ham, and my husband shrugged it off. Our waiter was very attentive throughout the meal and did more than apologize for the oversight: he replaced the sandwich in a to-go box, AND removed his entire lunch from the bill. We devoured the rest of mine with relish, and tipped him generously, and later the baguette made a great midnight snack.\\n\\nThe excellent customer service continued this week when I received an e-mail from the manager thanking me for my feedback. Professional, with an appropriate dash of panache.

In my earlier years it used to be Nino's but they have gone downhill over the last 10 years. I am happy to say I am so excited to have found the flavors of home and yet another Italian option. My boyfriend and I have been dying to try this place for a couple months but never been able to get in during prime dining hours. Hey they are always packed..that should be the first sign that they are good.  \\n\\nI must say the location in Buckhead is a bit confusing as it is in the bottom of a condo building and upon entering we thought we should have left a trail of bread crumbs to find our way out.  We had reservations in the courtyard at 8:30 and were immediately seated. We looked around at the crowd and noticed everyone was dressed nicely and it looked like an older crowd...we seemed to be the youngest people in there and trust me...we are not young. The service was pleasant, gracious quick and efficient. \\n\\nThe wine list is monumental and I could have sat there all night looking at the impressive options of wine. However, we settled on two glasses of Ruffino Chianti which was our only option of Chianti by the glass.  The waiter brought our wine and made several recommendations for us but I wanted garlic and pasta in the worst way. I selected the Cappellini con Pancetta, Gamberetti, Olive Nere, Aglio, Pomodoro Fresco e Mascarpone and my boyfriend had the Filetto di Manzo al Barolo along with the gazpacho.  The gazpacho had an interesting flavor but I am just not a fan of cold tomato with shrimp. My dish was excellent and not too filling. The taste of garlic was everything I had been craving. Even though it is a few days later I am still excited about the taste of that meal. It was simply memorable. The presentation of my boyfriend's filet was like something out of a New York restaurant. I appreciate good service and presentation which most restaurants in the south could care less about. For dessert our waiter suggested the peaches with Gran Marnier and though I am a chocolate girl I went along with his suggestion and was not disappointed. The peaches were lightly sweet and the Gran Marnier did not over power the peaches at all. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. We love the patio, the ambience and the old world charm of this restaurant and will definitely be back."},{"name":"Phatt Wraps","address":"10 E 12th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Super cool small place on 12th!

Tasty sauces are also in squeeze bottles. i liked the spicy Peruvian sauce. My kids loved  this place (he made quesadillas special for them). I also like the ginger/pear infused water (free).

Noise reverberates in the room, though, so I don't know if that's such a good feature if they don't try to mute the din - we had to raise our voices sometimes to carry over the ambient noise and we were at a corner of the restaurant - at least 4 or 5 tables away from anyone else. \\n\\nWe started out with some cocktails, which were very tasty. Good relaxation after the hoopla of Metrotown mall. Then my friend had some yam fries (decent, nothing to write home about) and a sandwich whilst I had a bowl of cream of tomato soup (which was hearty and had a good lively basil flavor, which speaks a little to its freshness). The service seemed a little surprised when they asked if I wanted bread and I said no. \\n\\nNo dessert, but they didn't press us on it, which I thought was good. They were slow to serve our soup and sandwich, at least 15-20 minutes from the drinks, which I think was a bit much, but the food was still hot at least. Maybe it really did take that long to prepare.\\n\\nTotal bill was $34 before tax and tip, which was pretty fair. \\n\\nI like this place, but would be more enamored if the noise was better managed and if they were quicker at turning out food.

I dress my breakfast sandwich with tabasco sauce and a little pepper.  They also have crepes, waffles, smoothies, fresh juices like orange and carrot.  They also have sandwiches -- haven't been here for lunch yet, but plan to go some weekend.  \\n\\nPeople seem to bury themselves in their books and laptops here, while others seem to just pop in for a hot cup of coffee to go.

My level of trust with her ability (and Yelp's) to find a great spot is pretty high.  Having her research spots was a safe option and something that she finds fun, almost like a treasure hunt.  So she gave me some choices, and I was thinking since we were going out for Asian that night, let's pick a more American type place.  Lebowski's sounded delightful, so we mapped it and the gps app took us in the most roundabout crazy method of getting there ever.  No big deal, the journey is part of adventure and we did avoid any traffic on I35 after leaving it in Georgetown.  It was just funny to go towards Houston first, then cut back on 45 past I35, down mopac to finally get to 183 at 35.  \\n\\nWe get to the address and are slightly confused because it is a bowling alley.  We are both like WTF?!  Many yelpers would have figured this out by digging into the reviews a bit, but my wife likes to make somewhat rash decisions while on vacation.  (hey she married me in similar fashion)  So I'm thinking this must be it?  We were expecting some charming little house or maybe a strip center spot.  The front entrance of the place was lined with smokers...gross but a good sign that they are non-smoking on the inside.  So we say what the hell, let's try it.   60+ reviews and it is 5star rated, nothing to fear except our prejudices.  We walk in past the shoe rental counter and take a left looking for the diner.  Well it isn't a restaurant like that, it is a counter that is at most 15' long.  Thankfully open mindedness prevailed, and boy let me tell you was I glad we were not scared to give this place a try.\\n\\nI asked the server/counterman for ordering advice, something that 90% of the time results in great things, especially if you give them some direction on what you like/prefer.  He pointed us towards their philly sandwiches or burgers.  I got the cheesesteak, my wife tried the chicken bacon.  We headed over to the lounge and sat at counter with our drinks.  About 10minutes later two of the most amazing sandwiches I've eaten arrived.  Fresh baked bread, perfectly grilled meat and cheese.  They were huge.  The fries were insane, well seasoned, cooked perfectly and they give you huge portions.  I did not realize (because I didn't read menu) that my sandwich had jalape√±os in it, which I would not normally order since I'm a bit of a puss when it comes to heat, but they were great addition to the meal.\\n\\nThe co-owner came by to check on us and give us some backstory.  He says that Yelp has recently discovered them and they are getting a lot of walk-in (non bowler) business.  He hooked us up with refills and a treat and was genuinely interested in how we liked meal and even gave us some ideas for other places in Austin that he personally loves to eat at.  So impressed with what an amazing spot this is and what cool people work there, we will for sure be back on next trip to ATX.  I've got my eyes and stomach set on trying their burgers next.

This place is phenomenal as a breakfast/lunch spot. \\n\\nI arrived to TnA a little after 11:00am on a Monday, and the place was about 3/4 full to my surprise. I was warmly greeted at the door by a server and given the option to sit at the well stocked, extravagant bar or to occupy a table. I picked the bar. The bartenders were equally friendly, and incredibly helpful with deciding on an Oregon made craft brew. The Occidental pilsner was suggested, and I must say it was indeed superb. \\n\\nThe menu itself had just about the perfect amount of options, not too many nor too few. Given the fact that it was 11:00am, and I already was enjoying an excellent Portland brew I decided on a neutral ground brunch: The Cowboy Breakfast; Steak, a fried egg, hashbrowns, and baked beans with shredded pork mixed in. The plating was artfully constructed, and the flavors blended well together. Everything about this meal was perfect; so much so that when it came time to leave I was actually almost sad to go. This establishment in my honest opinion truly reflects the essence of Portland. \\n\\nI gave Tasty N Alder a PERFECT 5/5.

I can tell you with certainty that 8pm on a Saturday evening is a *prime* time to visit Alberta PSB.  4 of the tables were occupied, and there was exactly nobody sitting directly at the counter when I walked in.  There was a relaxed, subdued vibe in there that I really appreciated, and of course this counters the chaotic breakfast and brunch crowds.\\n\\nSo a Reggie Deluxe and an Arnold Palmer it was.  I'm not going to be able to describe this sandwich and provide any more insight than has already been given.  It's just... a whole bunch of \\"s\\" words:\\n\\nSavory\\nSalty\\nSweet\\nSinful\\nSexy\\n\\n... yep, sexy.  I effectively made love to the Reggie Deluxe last Saturday evening.  It truly was an \\"event\\".  It was such a perfect cure to a typical soggy early spring Portland evening that I really don't know how else to describe it.\\n\\nSome people may think my next sentence is blasphemy, but now that I've recovered from bliss and been able to adjust my hindsight, I have an observation.  I'm not convinced that the addition of the egg (the \\"Deluxe\\" in Reggie Deluxe) does anything to seriously enhance the sandwich.  For ME, the stars of the show of the Reggie are, in order, the biscuit, the chicken, the gravy, the cheese and finally the bacon.  The first 3 ingredients are critical, while the rest is there in a supporting role.\\n\\nI find myself looking at the Mcisley or Chatfield and wonder if I can scrounge up the intestinal fortitude to cheat on my beloved Reggie.  Thus far, I have not been able to, and I'm okay with that.

I bought a $20 for $40 LivingSocial coupon and decided to come back. When I read the reviews I was very suprised because I very much enjoyed my first visit here.\\n\\nAMBIANCE:\\nScoozi is a \\"hip\\" little Italian place that's a part of the BU campus across from the school of management. Its something in between a Comella's type restaurant and a fancy North End affair. They have some rustic Italian dishes, but also have student specials some nights like $2 PBRs and Sangria and wing specials. If I lived in the Kenmore area, I would definitely frequent this place more often\\n\\nThis was a rainy Monday evening. We had a party of 5 coming, one of my friends went early to grab a table and I got there shortly after that. The waitress seated me promptly and pour water quickly. Off to a good start!\\n\\nThe two of us ordered garlic bread with bruschetta while we waited (there were about 4 different kinds to choose from). It came out pretty quick and was very good- it was layered under a light salad and the tomatoes were very fresh. This cost $5.95 and they only served us 3 pieces so I was pretty disappointed with that.\\n\\nFinally, the rest of the crew shows up and we order. The food comes in about 15 minutes. 2 of my friends ordered calzones so that was to be expected. They ordered Tuscano calzones, which had cheese, mozzarrella, arugula, and chicken sausage. From across the table it looked delicious and both of them agreed that for $10.95 it was well worth it.\\n\\nAnother got a spaghetti with tomatoes, basil and Parmesan. She asked the waitress if she could layer some extra Parmesan on top to make it resemble something like a baked ziti.  For 10.95, this was a very decent portion (she brought some home.) Although I usually like to be a bit more adventurous when I eat out, she said it was a very traditional dish that tasted the part. The basil smelled so fresh! I was surprised they put they much extra cheese on without charging her extra- a happy customer indeed!\\n\\nAnother ordered a Mesculun salad with grileld chicken. Now when I go out I go out to EAT, so you will probably never hear about me ordering a salad. Again, they topped the salad with plenty of chicken cut into long strips and was filled with candied walnuts and goat cheese on top. \\n\\nFinally me- the last time I came I ordered the Prosciutto panini. I kind of had low hopes considering this isn't exactly the most \\"authentic\\" Italian experience, but it came and was absolutely delicious. Fresh mozzarella, thicker prosciutto slices but still thin enough not to get too tough when you bite in, and of course pesto and balsamic vinigiarette. For $8.50 well worth it. And it came with an bag of chips! (albeit, probably the smallest bag of chips I've ever seen)\\n\\nLast night, I liked that first panani so much I opted to give it another chance, but I went with an Italian chicken salad this time, which is diced chicken marinated in balsamic vinaigrette, roasted red peppers, and provolone. This sandwich did not fail- definitely a pleaser. Bread was fresh and there was just enough peppers chopped in to not overpower the rest of the sandwich. While I think I liked the Prosciutto better, this was not a far second.\\n\\nAlso, the waitress was quick to clear all the plates and refill glasses. \\n\\nWe didn't order any drinks (just water), so the bill came out to $56.40, less the $40 from the LivingSocial coupon made it just under $17. We could not believe it because we felt like we had ate like kings. We gave the waitress a nice tip, and everyone ended up paying around $7 all together. Well, well worth it\\n\\nI would not say that the service was PHENOMENAL, but if I had not gone in expecting the worst I would have thought it was fine. In fact, it was fine.

We both agreed that the restaurant had the look and feel of a cozy chateau in the countryside of France.\\nAlthough we had heard it was a farm-to-table restaurant with local fresh ingredients, we didn't really know what type of cooking style it was going to be, but it turned out to seem mostly a French style, in that there were many small courses, all very artistically presented. I happen to like small portions. Some people who like larger portions would really enjoy the bread they served before the appetizers. There were three types of bread that they freshly baked right there. The ma√Ætre-de had a thick accent, so I can't remember what spices were in the breads, but they were quite delicious.\\nWe ordered the fixed tasting menu for two people which included some appetizers, dinner and desert.

They sat us at one of only two booths in the entire place and were quite comfortable.  The cheese and herb breadsticks were thrown on the table (interesting way of serving) and were accompanied by a lovely garlic/pine nut/green puree - I cannot remember what it was made of right now.  For appetizers we had the seared scallops, which were pretty good but not very creative.  I did like the portobello mushroom cap underneath.\\n\\nThe lamb special sounded amazing but since both of the guys ordered it, I decided on the pork chop and my cousin had the lobster.  Mine was by far the least delicious - it really is hard to do a good pork chop.  The lobster was poached in butter and was decadent on the tongue; the lamb special had various cuts and all were superb.  We had two bottles of wine - Pinot Noir and Malbec, both of which were excellent.  We were too full for dessert so opted to walk around Beacon Hill instead.\\n\\nI didn't see the final bill but I am guessing it was close to $100/person due to the wine.

More by the service and prices, than by the quality of the food itself. I was there with a group of seven for a dinner in honor of a friend who is getting married. The martinis, although expensive, seemed worth the splurge. I ordered the s'mores martini which sounded excellent. When the drinks came, the pop-rock martini and the East Meets West were the most well liked. One girls had to send her drink back because it was nothing like described and mine did not have marshmallows it in. When I inquired about the marshmallows the waitress said they didn't have any (it would have been nice to know about that before ordering my $12 drink). \\n\\nI wasn't all that hungry, so I ordered the spinach, goat cheese, and apple salad. Everyone received their food except the bride. We kept waiting and waiting while the waitress walked by and finally caught her attention. The bride asked where her dinner was and the waitresses stated that the chef had dropped her meal and that she forgot to tell us that! The bride insisted we eat. My salad alright, although nothing special and incredibly tiny for the price! I did try a bite of the mac & cheese which was really good and actually a very good portion size for a \\"side\\". Others enjoyed their burgers and the pizza one girl ordered was just so-so.

But sometimes your hands are forced. My friend and I wanted to eat some good wings so we decided to go where they say the wings are the best. I don't think it needs to be said, but this claim is untrue. The wings I had (bacon wrapped in Daytona sauce) were alright to say the best is an over statement. I also ordered the chili cheese fries and this was a mistake. The cheese taste like gas station nacho cheese. It had a dusty taste to it and was just not edible. The chili itself wasn't bad at all but between that and the chicken one of them mad me sick almost immediately after leaving Hooters. My friend didn't even touch his order after eating one of the fried shrimp on his plate and one of the boneless chicken pieces. This is rare because this dude eats almost anything, He too wasn't a fan of the chili cheese fries and that happens to be one of his favorite dishes. \\n\\nNow for the service:\\nWhen you walk in it is self seating only there is no sign that tells you that so for 5mins we sat at the door waiting to be greated. Then a waitress walked by and ignored us until I caught her attention and asked to be seated. She told me that we could sit anywhere. So when we sat down I noticed an employee casually sitting at a table with two other gentleman and thought it must be someone on their break nope she was our server and she was just sitting there chatting it up. Comfortably sitting, Oh Sasha, Sasha, Sasha. I dont know how things work at Hooters but if that were my establishment that would not be an option. This continued on for the 2 hours I was there. I needed stuff and she was busy just hanging out. At one point I had to stare over there and hope she looked at me. She brought the check and it sat at my table for 15mins before I asked another employee that was walking by to run it for me. We sat without refilled drinks or requests for quite sometime because all her attention was given to the 2 gentleman across from us. I kept thinking where is the management in that facility or if they even cared. That is the worst 50$ I spent. We didn't even eat any of the items we got. Well I had 3 of the 6 wings I ordered. Took the reordered chilli cheese fries home and no one there wanted it either. Safe to say I will no longer visit this location again or possibly another Hooters.

Magnolia Grill has no idea about cross contamination.  I'm celiac and have been since my very early twenties, so I know when I've been glutened. If you get their \\"gluten-free menu\\", they will offer you tacos cooked on a common grill--that was the first time I got glutened in the last month; then I got a plate of veggies, and the expediter put flour tortilas on top in a wet wrapper, right after they gave me a dinner salad with crackers on it, after I made my usual point of asking for the gluten-free menu and asking how the salad dressing was made.\\n\\nThis time, I told the waitress, and a line cook came over to talk to me. The line cook said, \\"I know someone who is celiac. I understand this is serious.\\"  While I appreciate the sentiment, offers to \\"redo the meal\\" when my long-suffering boyfriend would have to wait and the staff basically ruined the meal by preparing unsafe food isn't really worth it.  They have also never bothered to discount or comp an unsafe meal.  I made a point of passively aggressively eating the half of the plate not cross contaminated--and the server just said, \\"Oh, no box. You can't eat that.\\"  The staff at Magnolia gets it, but I don't think they care if they make someone who can't have wheat or gluten sick.\\n\\nIf you have to eat at Magnolia, try the enchiladas and the Martian Landscape. Magnolia does o.k. with things that go in the oven that can't touch shared grills or have gluten added to them.

It honestly just tasted like a more crispier version of Chick-Fil-A's chicken sandwich. To enhance the flavor, I asked for mayo and ketchup, but my mayo never came so I just had it with ketchup. It was not bad but it wasn't worth 15 dollars for a sandwich. I also tried their sides. Mac n Cheese wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be. Their green beans were good though. \\n\\nI to-goed their key lime pie (their key lime pie was really good! I'd go back for their pie).

There was one guy at the register and several people standing around, not actually in line. One man was in front of me, sort of. After about 5 minutes of listening to the kid at the register answer the phone and take orders without so much as acknowledge there were real live people standing in front of him, one of the harried looking kitchen staff shouted to me, \\"Are you picking up or ordering?\\" Kid at register, whose job I assume this other person was now doing, continued to ignore us.\\n\\nI shouted my name, loudly enough for everyone in the place to look over at me, which sent aforementioned harried looking kitchen person rummaging through the warming cabinet. Then a conference with another kitchen staff person. At this point she says something unintelligible to me, which I assume translated to, \\"We screwed up your order and will have to make it over. It's going to be about half an hour.\\"\\n\\nOK, I was perturbed, but that happens. After about 45 minutes, my patience was wearing thin and it bust have showed, because another guy wearing a baby approached and mentioned the look on my face might indicate I wasn't especially happy. He explained he and his wife had called in an order to eat in, and since they had an infant time was of the essence. Seems they'd been standing around for close to an hour too. Overhearing the conversation, two guys who were behind me in line and were now seated across from me chimed in they too had ordered online, and had even called to check it was ready before driving to pick up, and had been waiting close to 30 minutes. \\n\\nLook. Maybe the ordering system was gimped. Maybe somebody accidentally deleted everyone's orders. I don't know. But throughout the entire wait no one explained what was happening or offered any sort of apology. OK, the guy who FINALLY gave me my pizza threw in a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon, which I could get any given week in Community Impact Newspaper. All I'm asking for is a little customer service. I've worked in some high pressure retail and food service in my time, and you ALWAYS make time to help the customer who's standing right there, especially when they have a look of bewilderment leading to anger.\\n\\nMaybe we'll come back, but honestly, we'll probably just order from Mangieri's."},{"name":"Imperial Fez","address":"2285 Peahtree Rd NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I was incredibly surprised to read the reviews that weren't very nice.

The flavors we ok but it wasn't a seafood risotto. It had a strong bacon and beef taste to it. I ate about half of it and was done.  The servers are very nice and were good about not charging us for her dish. The atmosphere is really great. My thought is that if a dish is going to cost you $20-$27 it should be right.

Buttery biscuits over fried chicken with bacon and if you want eggs, all smother in gravy? (3) You're in Alberta, an area I like drinking, and open fairly late, because quite counter-intuitively, when I want breakfast foods most is when it's late, I'm drunk, and I want something to eat before bed. (4) Service is always super friendly and you tolerate said drunkeness. Sorry I forgot to bus my plate that one time, I tried to make up for it later with a generous tip. (5) You serve drinks and great bloody marys. Also great when it's late and I'm drunk and preemptively fighting the hangover, or the morning after too. (6) Uh.. just because I'm such a positive person. (7) I just want to hit an even 10. (8) Diets are overrated. (9) Alton Brown stopped by and approved! Well I'm not sure which location exactly.

I find that each BBQ joint I eat at is compared in my mind to Dinosaur.  Now, don't get me wrong, I've had BBQ since Syracuse in other places and have enjoyed it...for instance Firefly's in Framingham was quite tasty, as well as some little place in NYC I visited with a friend.  Unfortunately, for all the hype I heard about Redbones, it just didn't do it for me.\\n\\nI'll give Redbones an A for rib joint atmosphere...though still not up to Dinosaur standards, it had that nice lived in feeling, and I had high hopes after waiting at the bar sampling from their ample selection of beers on tap.  I must say that a favorite BBQ dish of mine has always been the pulled pork.  So I figured that I would sample that.  My first tip off should have been when we realized that the sauce selections at redbones would clearly not be on our sandwiches because the samples didn't come until after we got them.  OK, that's fine.  But then the cardinal sin was comitted...one of the two sides I ordered was the black beans they had that night.  My sandwich came to me on a very small plate, crammed on top of the two sides, and with the bun now sufficiently soaked in black bean sauce.  WE HATE SOGGY BUNS!!  Please, Redbones, separate the sides!  A good mess BBQ meal clearly requires plates with cordoned off sections of the plate!  Also, the mashed potatoes I got, though quite tasty, ended up dry due to the lack of gravy.\\n\\nThe sandwich itself was the largest disappointment...aside from the soggy roll, I was not a huge fan of any of the sauces presented before us.  Where was the traditional sweet BBQ sauce?  The pork was definitely on the fatty side, and the bun was disintegrating by the time it even touched my lips.\\n\\nPerhaps if I had tried their ribs or another dish,t hings would have turned out better, but how can you mess up pulled pork?  I will in the future most likely abstain from Redbones, unless presented with a free meal...and I shall continue my search for some good BBQ in Boston...or keep begging Dinosaur to open up a restaurant for all us poor alumni here in NE."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We only did appetizers and they were all tasty.

I've lived in Austin since '85 and have eaten everywhere, high end, low end, with friends, family, coworkers, I've done it all here in town.  Up until tonight I, for some reason, haven't tried out Zoot.  The double sided menu had a full 4-5 course option and an al'carte side as well.  If you're vegetarian, one of the full course options looked pretty good.  First of all I got to say the hostess and servers were cordial, the following, I'm sure is a management issue.  Anyway, I need to get to the point of why I'm even bothering to write this: CORKAGE FEES!  Give me a freaking break, $25 per bottle is over the top.  I don't mind seeing fourteen dollar appetizers and nine dollar salads or thirty something dollar entrees but when you're invited to bring in your own bottles of favorite wine and then later charged $25 for each bottle to pop the cork, that's just unacceptable!  Understood, corkage fees vary widely, but we're in Austin and even in NYC $25/per is too much.  Okay, so you're a restaurateur and you've traveled the world to bring the best mix of wines to serve your patrons, great,  than say \\"no we don't offer a corkage service\\", don't spring a $50 corkage fee on a table, talk about sticker shock!  Our objections were heard and a minor reduction was offered but damage was done.  I don't foresee that I'll be going back.  There are too many other fine dining opportunities in Austin where I can avoid the awkward experience I had a Zoot.    You may not be planning on bringing in your own wine but there may be some other circumstance that arise and then you hear the dreaded, words \\"sorry but that's our policy\\"."},{"name":"RAM Restaurant and Brewery","address":"6632 Longshore St","city":"Dublin","stars":"3","text":"My friend & I went on a Friday night.

Decided to sit at the bar, and there's a lower seating area (as opposed to the high stools) that's perfect for my height, and making it perfect for taking great photos. Very dark in the small restaurant, lit mostly by small candles at the table. The bartender didn't provide as much attention to each group at the bar table as she could have. It took a long while for me to even receive a menu, and it took a long while to put in my order. Moreover, it took forever for the food to arrive. Granted, the presentation and quality are incredible, but if this was Hell's Kitchen, the chefs would never hear the end of it from Gordon Ramsay for not getting the food out in a reasonable amount of time.\\n\\nAlright, let's get to the food. The Pan Roasted Duck Breast (with pommes aligot, fontina, duck egg, and figs), $30, is absolutely gorgeous. Paired it with a glass of Rose wine, $8. The drink was a little strong and seemed to make it more difficult to finish my rich meal. The duck is juicy and does not have too much fat or skin. The duck egg is sunny side up and almost melts into the creamy, slightly cheesy mashed potato. The figs are a little on the soggy/mushy side, but I usually refuse to eat figs, so the fact that I finished them is a big thumbs-up from me. Absolutely divine. The colors, the flavors, the portion. Wow.\\n\\nI was definitely beyond full from the main course alone, but I really wanted dessert also. I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e (with honey meringue and lavender crackers), $9, thinking it would be small. HAHAHA Oh how wrong I was!! It's HUGE. Possibly spans the diameter of my hand with my fingers spread apart. Beautiful. I usually don't like the hard layer of caramel over the custard, and my opinion did not change with this dessert. However, I was impressed with both the beautiful zigzags and fluffiness of the meringue and the richness of the dark chocolate. Didn't like the crackers though. I nearly couldn't finish my dessert. The richness of the entire meal (entree and dessert) made it tough beyond belief, even for me!\\n\\nLast but not least, instead of fortune cookies, this place provides mini, bite-size macaroons (different flavors daily). According to the waitress, I sampled their Tangerine macaroons, which were labeled as Orange Olive Oil in the kitchen area (open to the public through a glass window next door). Unique, but not a fan.\\n\\nAmazing food, but the night would have been even better if the menu and food were served more promptly.

I have been several times at different times throughout the week, and I have always been impressed. There are a few tables and a counter for patrons to eat inside, and when the weather is nice, there are tables and chairs set up outside. If you eat there, the doughnuts come on a cute little metal tray.\\n\\nWhen you arrive, you will be greeted with a display case or many different styles and kinds of doughnuts. There are some kinds like the buttermilk and salted caramel that I have seen (and eaten) each time I go, which are really yummy dipped in milk! There are also seasonal doughnuts that are inspired by different holidays and other things that are going on around town, such as the gingerbread and the cinnabun doughnuts. My favorites are the salted caramel bacon and the crodoughs. There are vegan, yeast, and cake styles, which all have a unique taste. They also have some savory doughnuts with ham and cheese, which I really like too.\\n\\nI really love the drip coffee here, which is self-serve, but they have a variety of other coffee drinks as well. I have not tried them, however.\\n\\nThis place is kid friendly because what kid does not like doughnuts! They have a little kitchen for the kids to play with while they wait or to take a break between yummy doughnut bites.

I've heard many people rave about this place so I decided I should finally give this place a try.\\n\\nThe overall experience was excellent!\\n\\nFood was great, we just had to check off the items we wanted and they would bring enough for the number of people at your table, unlike some places that will deliberately cut down on portions even when you ask for extra. Chubby Lamb's method works well for portion control too because it actually gives you a chance to try different items, then re-order your favourites the second/third/fourth time around! Their selection of hot pot items was great, and everything came out quite quickly.\\n\\nMy favourite item actually wasn't a hot pot item though. Their green onion pancake is TO DIE FOR! I think our table of 8 people ordered 6 orders of green onion pancake and the dish was gone as soon as it came out! Cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and soft and tender/chewy on the inside, I would go back time and time again just for this item!\\n\\nIn addition to great food, their service was also top notch. The waitresses were always friendly and attentive, and brought what we asked for in a very timely manner, be it more food items, extra cutlery, more dipping sauces, tea, drinks. They even came by a few times to change out our plates so we always had a clean plate to eat out of!\\n\\nAnother unique aspect of this joint that I haven't seen at other places, is that you can add unlimited, all-you-can-drink pop to your all-you-can-eat meal. It's not the cheap, watered down fountain drink stuff, either -- they bring you the whole can, as many cans as you want with your meal!\\n\\nThe only disappointment of the night was realizing that I should have checked out this place a lot sooner!\\n\\nTwo thumbs up for sure, and definitely my new favourite hot pot joint! :)"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"When visiting Portland a few weekends ago, my best friend and I came here based on a recommendation from one of my friends who is a local.

Luckily, when we got here we just avoided the line. There was one open table to seat us and after that I kept hearing the waiter say \\"45min-1hr wait\\" for the people who came right after us.\\n\\nSo we ordered a bunch of different types of oysters and clams as well as the Hot Lobster Roll. Surprisingly, our raw stuff took so long to come out.... It took about 30 minutes for the oysters and clams to get to our table. Raw food shouldn't take this long to be served!!! Our waiter probably saw our frustrated and hungry faces and noticed that our raw bar food had yet to be served. He quickly gave us a free appetizer. It was Hamachi Sashimi served with avocado spread. It was delicious and made me hungrier!\\n\\nThe raw items were FINALLY served to us and were quickly devoured. Clams were meaty, juicy, and sweet and oysters were sweet and creamy. They were super fresh! Definitely worth trying even though they are super expensive.\\n\\nThe hot lobster rolls were amazing. I did NOT expect SO MUCH LOBSTER. Usually, places skim on the lobster when making a roll by mixing it with a bunch of mayo and completely chopping the lobsters until you cannot tell whether or not its lobster that you're eating. Not this place! There was big ass lobster chunks perfectly placed in between a slightly grilled bun.

There's a cozy coffee shop a few doors down that you can wait at. The restaurant itself has a bit of an at the docks feel decorated with posters of various kinds of fish. \\n\\nOysters: first place I tasted oysters and now hooked. The raw bar has both local and those from father afield. Sitting at the bar you can watch them shuck the oysters and watch passerbys peer into the restaurant to stare at them. Fresh and served with lemon and a cocktail sauce topped with a bit of garlic in truffle oil--yum.\\n\\nNeptune on Piggyback: fried oysters topping pork belly. The whole meal was so not kosher, but so, so delicious. \\n\\nScallops: delicious scallops-perfectly seared on the outside. They come on a base of potato puree topped with a bed of brussels sprouts, chanterelles, and some more pork belly. \\n\\nLobster Roll: get it hot with butter--it practically melts in your mouth. This is the lobster roll to measure others by. \\n\\nThe previous time I went, we had the clams as well, brought on accident, which they comped. Also, delicious. \\n\\nOnly negatives: no dessert (sad) and longish wait times (the 36 hours in Boston NYTimes article may have made it worse, but I did get seated immediately last time--at 6:30 on Monday night).\\n\\nOtherwise, when in Boston, grab your besties, order a glass of prosecco and dig into some phenomenal seafood."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is great and worth the wait.

BBQ that was open.  It has a walk-up counter that most of the vendors have in Krog Market.  It was apparently one of their first days open because there were four people behind the counter that didn't seem to know what was going on that day.  I'm not going to give these guys hell for service, i'm sure that will improve.\\n\\nThe food: I'm very partial to pulled pork and based on what I had today I was very disappointed - I've had better.  It had a faint smokey flavor, but was also very bland which required their Carolina BBQ sauce for flavor.  I had the 1/2 pound which came with two large pieces of bread.  Although they don't offer a BBQ sandwich option, with the large two pieces you can easily make a sandwich. It also seems they are set up great for take out but if you plan on eating within Krog Market, bring along someone to share your meal - the servings are huge.  I made the mistake of ordering Potato Salad as a side, it was ginormous.  It's the size of the Potato Salad you pick up at the Publix Deli, it was very good, but I was disappointed they didn't have a smaller size at that time. \\n\\nOne other problem is that they don't have an ice machine, so if you want some of their sweet tea, you are limited to a half gallon container - it's $2 which is fair, but if you dine in it's very inconvenient to carry to your table to eat and tea without ice?  Clearly they didn't plan on folks eating there in Krog Market, especially one person.  This is something I'm sure they will address in the future because many of their customers will be dropping by for a quick lunch.   Those of us who eat solo wouldn't want all of the inconveniences of their current format - I hope they will address this., it would make a huge difference.\\n\\nThere are several great BBQ joints on this side of town - Daddy Ds and Fox Brothers - G.C.'s has alot to live up to with their pulled pork,  I will be back to try their Ribs and Brisket, but I'll bring along someone along to share a 1/2 gallon of tea with no ice, and the huge container of potato salad."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"We had the Shrimp and Andouille cheddar grits and the Chicken Pontchartrain (lots of artichoke hearts) - they were both delicious!

OK, I didn't trip and fall mouth first into a plate of grilled chicken but when I'd meant to get a salad at Soup Garden, my hands turned right when they should've turned left.  I found myself driving in the wrong direction so rather than attempt an ill-advised U-Turn on Cobb Parkway, I continued in the direction I was traveling.  This took me to Yakitori Jinbei.\\n\\nYakitori Jinbei is everything that RuSan's isn't.  RuSan's plays either elevator techno or a happy happy joy joy mix of 80s one-hit wonders while Yakitori Jinbei's soundtrack are nothing but soothing acoustic guitar covers of old standards, songs I recognized entirely as the pre-programmed self-play selections from my parents' old Yamaha keyboard.  Apparently the Japanese have a thing for \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" and the song \\"More.\\"\\n\\nSpeaking of Japanese, you'd be hard pressed to find any at RuSan's.  Here, however, almost the entire staff is Japanese.  While I found this comforting in a Japanese restaurant, it made the name of the free Japanese publication \\"Axis Atlanta\\" placed next to the stack of Creative Loafing most unfortunate.\\n\\nDespite its historical inappropriateness, Yakitori is both utilitarian and hospitable.  OK, so most of the signage is in Japanese and the default utensil are chop sticks, it's still far from intimidating.  I've enjoyed my visits here, even though today I was subjected to a 40 minute monologue by some put-upon office worker sitting next to me detailing the atrocities committed upon him by his company.  The bigger injustice here is his poor lunchmate whose responses were limited entirely to \\"Uh-huh\\" and \\"Wow.\\" \\n\\nBut other than being sat next to unfunny Dilbert, the meal went splendidly.  For the uninitiated, yakitori are basically Japanese shish kebobs, but the meat is cut much smaller and thinner and grilled at a very high temperature.  As good as they are, I ordered the ramen soup instead, a large bowl of ramen noodles and broth, topped with roast pork and seaweed.  The noodles have the bite of those freshly made; it's pleasantly disconcerting considering where my ramen is normally sourced.\\n\\nSo what did I learn today?  First, ramen is best eaten when it's not bought six for a dollar.  Second, sometimes you have to trust your auto-pilot even when it steers you in the wrong direction.  Finally, and perhaps most important to at least one guy in the city of Smyrna,  work sucks and Kevin in Accounts Receivable is a real big dick."},{"name":"One Taco","address":"520 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Today i went by this little truck to try the tacos.

Family restaurant in strip mall, trailer, fast-food-like counter service - these are the hallmarks of the typical taco place in Austin. So what would happen if you served up tacos in a fancy shmancy, designer-decorated, trendy downtown location?  You'd have Garrido's.\\n\\nGarrido's is basically a taco place in a Uchi-like setting.  It's a bit odd, and I'm not sure it really works.  But if Frank's can make a go of it selling hot dogs in the old Starlite location, then Garrido's has a shot too.\\n\\nThe food at Garrido's is on par with the many other better taco places around, but what makes it stand out are a few unique tacos types available nowhere else, like oyster and ahi tuna.  I had both these tacos, and they were great - oysters were lightly battered and huge, ahi tuna was juicy, but could have been rarer.  The aiolis that came with each taco were very flavorful and tangy.  Ask for the aioli on the side if you don't want your taco overly sweet.\\n\\nThe sides left something to be desired.  Both the refried black beans and the borracho beans were humdrum, and the verde rice was nothing special.  \\n\\nThe interior design was just plain weird - like 3 different designers each got to do different parts of the room, and they all hated each other and wanted to do something as unlike the others as possible.  Also, what's up with the light blonde wood, medium brown wood, and dark brown woods all mixed up willy nilly together?  The whole place looks mismatched.  It's not bad - I actually kind of liked it - but it was weird.  If you are female, definitely check out left-hand stall in the bathroom.  Nothing like using the toilet located inches away from a floor-to-ceiling window.\\n\\nPrice-wise, you are definitely paying $2 more per taco for ambiance and location over the going rate for similar tacos in town.  Whether you think that is worth it is up to you.  \\n\\nDespite my mixed feelings about Garrido's, I still find myself thinking about that great oyster taco, and how I'd like another one. Mmm.  Oyster taco good.

Like Granpa's diner it has some really good American staples like pancakes, eggs, bacon, burgers, fries, pattymelts..but it also has a great selection of other goodies too where they try to stretch their wings into more diverse cuisine. They seem to have a loyal local following. My sample was of the Love Migas which was an interesting dish and I had it with some queso and also some salsa.The queso was AWESOME but on the salsa: CANT YOU MAKE YOUR OWN SALSA FRESH? The garlic in the dish was tasty but clearly undercooked which led to a late night haunting and re-visitation which was not quite as bad as the Amityville Horror..but a nonetheless a milder, irritating but still scary poltergeist moving furniture and slamming cabinet doors. My companion had the turkey rueben and fries which was DELICIOUS. I only rate this place 3 stars but I WOULD STILL GO BACK again and try some other things on the menu if it were late at night and was in the area. I would take this place over a fast food chain late at night any day.  If I had a fourth star to give here it would be for the effort and sincerity of service they bring.

The remoulade sauce just didn't do anything for me at all. The tart taste was not there and it didn't work well with either dish.

Now you haven't had eggs until you've tried these they're light, fluffy and cheesy as can be.

At first, I thought that they were bursting because they were getting stuck to the paper or to their neighbors. But, I was extremely careful and handled the last couple very delicately, and they still popped. I blame an inconsistent membrane for their volatility. Much like how a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link, a Bao membrane is only as strong as it's weakest spot. As soon as I attempted to pick one up, the juice evacuated via the weakest point in the membrane. And, before you accuse me of being ham-fisted, I burst 4/5 and my wife went 3/4.  Neither one of us was successful in handling these Xiao Long Baos. The one Bao that survived long enough to transport its payload to my mouth proved to be a disappointment because it did not contain much juice/soup and the taste was lacking. \\n\\nThe Chicken Chow Mein, fortunately, was a better experience.  Noodles were the appropriate firmness, and there were enough chicken chunks to almost guarantee one with every bite. \\n\\nHowever, the Beef Noodle Soup was another disappointment.  First, this place did not offer a hot/spicy variant so the soup base tasted very one-dimensional. Even a dash of salt would have made a big difference. The noodles were also a letdown. Just like how spaghetti should be al dente, noodles need to have an appropriate firmness. Our noodles were not only NOT firm, but some seemed to be on the verge of disintegrating. Perhaps they had been sitting around in liquid too long, but their mushy consistency ruined the dish despite there being a good amount of beef and tendons. \\n\\nWe initially planned on going to Wang's Shanghai Cuisine across the street but we did not realize that they were closed on Wednesday.

As someone who usually just 'wings it' with what sounds good at the time, this was something of an adjustment for me.  On the plus side, I now sometimes 'forget' that I ordered something delicious and have a pleasant surprise when the delivery shows up so there's always a flipside.  (I have it delivered to my office but you do need to remember to put a cooler out if you're having it delivered to your home when you're not there)\\n\\nAnyway, I suggest you just pull up their site, pick out the yummiest sounding item, and schedule a pickup or delivery for yourself to  understand and appreciate the whole experience.  So far my favorites include the lentil soup, tomato basil soup, new england clam chowder, penne with vodka sauce and this week what prompted by review is some very delicious pasta with bolognese sauce.

He asked me what I was in the mood for... I said curry.  He suggested Coco Hut Singapore.  \\n\\nSituated in a Chinese strip mall this place is tiny. I would say at most this restaurant can seat 30 people.  I believe this is a family run restaurant. They only had one waiter to look after maybe 6 or 7 tables. Still the guy was really motoring and we were serviced well. \\n\\nCoco Hut kind of serves the same type of food as Mamalees (one of my all time faves).  But Coco Hut's menu is a bit more extensive. My friend and I shared a bunch of dishes. We has the roti, beef and chicken skewers, curry beef brisket, and Hainanese Chicken with rice. \\n\\nThe roti was ok, but a bit dense. Certainly not as light and flakey as Mamalees. The skewers were ok too. But the beef skewer was on the tough side. Next the curry beef brisket was good. Not too spicy but sorry I like the Mui Garden beef brisket more!  The Hainanese Chicken... again ok but compared to Mamalees Coco Hut's chicken is a bit overbearing. The pieces of chicken at Mamalees are delicately sliced. The customer has the feeling that every piece of chicken on his plate was personally selected and dissected for him. The Coco Hut chicken are just big slabs cut out and placed on the plate. \\n\\nI may be a bit too critical of the Coco Hut. Comparing this restaurant to my other favourites is a bit like comparing one old gf with another. I should really just be happy and judge this restaurant on its own merits. \\n\\nOverall, Coco Hut is pretty darn good!  I would come back!

If you come to Pho Pasteur as hungry as I was when I stopped by, you don't want to be slurping soup. You want to be stuffing your face full of really tasty fried rice, fried eggs, and meat as fast as you possibly can.\\n\\nSo yeah. I was hungry. No... I was ravenous. I ordered a rice plate with BBQ pork chops. I substituted fried rice for two bucks extra, and added two fried eggs for another $1.50. Totally, totally worth it, especially if your motto is the same as mine: The more fried food on your plate, the better!\\n\\nThe rice plate came with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, all of which were crisp and very fresh. Now, with all that glorious fried food and meat in front of me, you'd think I'd have no interest in veggies. But they were really quite refreshing, and tasted amazing when dabbled with a little hot sauce!\\n\\nService was lousy, but they were really busy, and I didn't come here expecting a fine dining experience (duh), so it's okay. My bill came to about twelve dollars, and I left with my belly full. That's all that matters."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Worth the 3 1/2 hour wait!  Put your name on the list and kick around the neighborhood.  You're near Paul Revere's house, the Old North Church, and the shops at Fanueil Hall.  Or, wander across the street to Vito's for a beer.  \\n\\nSo, back to Neptune... The oysters are so fresh you taste the ocean.  Absolutely spectacular.  My husband and I shared two dozen, then a bowl of fresh, made to order clam chowder, and split a hot lobster roll.  I thought the lobster roll could've been more toasted, my husband loved it, I just have thing about mushy bread.\\n\\nExcellent wine list!\\n\\nThey don't do dessert.\\n\\nGreat service.

Chandeliers, red velvet booths, and low lighting.  A suit of knight's armor greets you at the front door.  \\n\\nThe first visit, we both had the 8 oz rib eye steaks with baked potatoes and broccoli.  The steaks were perfectly cooked medium and delicious.\\n\\nThe second visit was not so good.  The prime rib lover in our party tried the signature dish.  The prime rib ordered medium was served rare.  Even trying to cut it with a steak knife was an ordeal.  It was tough and not at all acceptable.  The restaurant claims that the prime rib is carved at the table.  Although we saw the silver cart, it was parked tonight.  No carving table side.\\n\\nThe halibut fish and chips was fairly disappointing.  The fish itself was good, but the execution was greasy.  \\n\\nThe blackened salmon was served with the skin on and was fishy.  \\n\\nThe \\"seasonal\\" vegetables appear to always be broccoli.  No exceptions.  No substitutions.\\n\\nAlthough their menu online lists the 8 oz rib eye steak for $20, it was not listed on the menu we were given on my second visit.  Our server could not explain to us why it was not offered.\\n\\nThe reviews I've read seemed to be mixed.  My advice would be:  if you order prime rib and it's tough, send it back!  We should have done that.  Some people have liked it, so they must be capable of serving a decent prime rib.  DO NOT order any type of fish.  If you want a smaller cut of rib eye, share a larger order."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Admittedly, I'm a fan of Ken's Artisan Pizza, but I'm always hoping there will be another venue for wood fired pies in Portland that competes. The verdict on Lovely's new Mississippi storefront, fittingly, is fifty/fifty. We tried four pies and tried to stay as close to Ken's menu as possible to compare apples to apples: A margherita with calabrian chiles ($14), spicy sopressata with oregano ($15), chanterelle mushroom with gremolata ($17), and rapini and fennel sausage with calabrian chiles ($17). \\n\\nWe had hoped to pile on the arugula, but at $4 for this addition, it would have been cheaper to sneak a box of Fred Meyer arugula in under our jackets [maybe next time].\\n\\nWe received the pies not in one fell swoop, but pie by pie. This was fine as we were sharing, but in a table of non-sharers, this would have been problematic. The standout was the rapini and fennel sausage, which paired singed bitterness of the rapini leaves with a decadent earthy sausage, a perfect taste blend. The disappointment was the spicy sopressata with oregano. This is a standout pie at Ken's, but here, we had to send it back to the kitchen. Not a person at the table could stomach the sopressata, which had turned gamey and oily upon cooking. It ruined the palate.\\n\\nWe were not dissuaded from trying their ice creams, despite the reject pie. And we are so glad we didn't. This was the gem of the restaurant! The valrhona chocolate and mint  stracciatella ice creams were exceptional. Worth a solo dessert visit. If only they had an ice cream bar/counter to take advantage of this.\\n\\nStandouts: Rapini and Fennel Sausage Pizza, Valrhona chocolate or mint stracciatella ice cream\\nRejects: Spicy Sopressata with Oregano Pizza"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"(June 11, 2011)\\n\\nRight away the eccentricity is apparent. It looked like a restaurant that Elvis Presley and Janice Joplin would have opened had they not gone into music, got married, and learned how to cook really good food.\\n\\nFrom the neon sign which reads \\"Sorry, We're Open\\", to the fascinating murals painted on the walls and ceiling, it's apparent this establishment is aimed squarely at the non-foodie who wants to eat good.\\n\\nAnd what good food it is!\\n\\nTouted on their website as fresh food cooked with a passion, \\"kind of like your favorite aunt's giant kitchen, if she had one\\", their menu boasts such intriguing entries as; \\"voodoo chicken\\" and \\"voodoo burgers\\" which are basically blackened spices, and available bison burgers.\\n\\nBreakfast, which is served 24/7, includes standard breakfast fare with a southwestern flair, lox and bagels, and healthy options such as egg white omelets, granola and fruit, and your choice of buttermilk, whole wheat, gingerbread or cornmeal pancakes.\\n\\nFor lunch diners can chose between a number of salads, soups, sandwiches and entrees. Since the wait looked to be about 45 minutes, we went next door to the Prima Dora, a quaint little shop full of equally eccentric items right next door. Evidently the owners of both establishments were in cahoots--diners waiting for tables are paged over the PA system, which covers both buildings. This gave us time to peruse the wares until our table was ready.\\n\\nOnce seated, we chose the Neptunian Landscape ($4.95) for appetizer. It is a strange yet delicious take on the traditional potato skins appetizer you see at most bar & grille establishments. Only this one is a concoction of chunks of seasoned-grilled potato, avocado, green onion, verde and lemon sour cream and jack cheese. In a word, it was \\"yummy!\\"\\n\\nFor lunch, I went with the chicken fajitas ($8.95), which included grilled seasoned chicken breast, pico de gallo, BBQ sauce and black beans, all topped with queso and chipotle. Dawn chose the Chicken Enchiladas ($7.50); Ancho chicken with cheddar and jack cheese in a corn tortilla.\\n\\nThe combination of flavors in both dishes were like good wine--surprising initial, satisfying and full-body flavors, and a wonderful follow. No flavor over-rode the other... it was as if a classically trained conductor wrote a culinary symphony just for us. I happily give Magnolia Caf√© the 9.5 it deserves.\\n\\nWe shared the meals, finished our iced tea, and headed back to Prima Dora to buy a couple of books we had our eyes on. One title of mine included \\"James Dean Died Here: Locations of America's Pop Culture Landmarks\\" by Chris Epting, which I'm sure will turn out to be a great read.\\n\\nAnd if I had my way, I'd ask Epting to add Magnolia Caf√© to his list.\\n\\nMy best advice to the owners; figure out some better parking. Then again, you'd need to expand that dining room.  Okay, keep it as it is."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Seating can be a bit tricky depending on the time of day you visit. Food is reasonably priced and the flavors are subtle. Maybe even a little too subtle, where it risk being labeled as bland. The self-seating and self-bus aspect of the restaurant is great, if all the patrons respect it. The wait time for food can be timely if the kitchen isn't moving efficiently.

While I usually like to open with a brief description of the place for usefulness to readers, this is particularly important to note. It is a BBQ restaurant, not an old comedian (that's Red Skelton) nor Captain America's arch-nemesis (that's Red Skull). These are very important distinctions to make because if you ask Red Skull for BBQ he will kill you and I don't think it'd be right if anyone attacked Red Skelton's tomb believing him to be a threat to democracy worldwide from the grave. \\n\\nOnto the actual place: The food is awesome!!!!......um...sometimes. This is what vexes me most about Redbones, where Red Skull is consistently evil, and Red Skelton was consistently funny (probably, I wasn't alive in 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's so I wouldn't really know but my grandparents loved the guy) Redbones is inconsistent in its food. Some days it is like bathe me in this sauce and meat and come back 2 days later to make sure I'm still breathing good, and other times it's \\"meh.\\" Why? I DON'T KNOW! \\n\\nThe place is always jam packed. Upstairs is reminiscent of some strange mix of nostalgia and what you might expect from a southern hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint (Formica tables, etc.) while downstairs is more like a hip bar/restaurant. I prefer downstairs better, even though the wall murals make me feel like I've dropped acid despite never having actually done so in my life. Seriously, there's like one eyed aliens using skeletons (not red though...strange) as surfboards on waves of magma or something like that. I don't know. Maybe none of it exists and it's just something in the sauce that trips me out. \\n\\nThey've got an extensive beer list which I've found quite good, though I'm not sure on how reasonably priced they are (one of the problems with drinking exotic craft brews at a restaurant- \\"Oh that sounds great for $8!\\" then flash-forward a week later and you see the same stuff in a sixer at a store for $9 or something). \\n\\nThe best things I've had there though usually involve fried catfish, but they had some lunch special that was like $9 and a melange of mystery BBQ meats and that was fan-frickin-tastic! \\n\\nAlas, though my gut tells me to give Redbones a 4-star rating, my taste buds tell me 3-stars is the way to go.

The brunch guests oohed and ahhed and chose their flavors, each sampling several (I got almost all the flavors).  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  I don't understand how people rave about these when they are so unbelievably dense and heavy.  It actually took force to get my knife through them.  Through a doughnut!  Aren't doughnuts supposed to be light and tender?  The flavors were okay, but the weight, texture, and density were very disappointing.  Like lead bombs of sugar, with a tough crumb.  And I don't understand why they make some of their cream-filled doughnuts like whoopie pies-cutting them open and spreading the filling instead of injecting it inside, containing it.  As tough as the doughnuts are, the filling squeezes out all over the place when you try to bite into it.  \\nNeedless to say I was so excited to have them for my hubbie's birthday, and was just embarrassed and irritated that I dropped $25 on a dozen doughnuts.\\n\\nThe coffee, though, was REALLY good.

I figured if it was even half as good as Toro Bravo it'd be an awesome brunch. Sadly it was a very mediocre meal. \\n\\nSeeing as it was just me for brunch I was able to grab a seat at the bar and avoided what looked to be a substantial wait. The bartender, while far from friendly, was efficient and fast. I ordered a bloody mary and made it \\"Midwestern\\" by adding a beer for $1. While touted as being spicy, I thought the bloody mary was really lacking in flavor. \\n\\nAfter seeing one of their amazing, huge biscuits at a table close to me I decided on ordering one of the biscuit sandwiches. I chose one with a fried egg, fried chicken, and cheddar. It came out really quick which I found to be a bit suspicious. After the first bite I realized everything was rather cold. Almost as if they had fried chicken and a fried egg already prepared and just threw it together. Sometimes a simple fried chicken can be the best. No need for crazy spices and flavors, but this was taking simple a bit too far. I thought the breading was pretty bland and could really use some more salt. Since the chicken was far from freshly fried it also had a really tough texture. The egg, also cold, was cooked to oblivion and pretty rubbery. There was a huge slice of cheddar. I like cheese but I actually thought the portion was too big. It wasn't proportionate with the other ingredients and really overwhelmed the biscuit. The biscuit itself was the only thing I liked about the meal. It was light, flaky, tender, buttery and one of the best biscuits I've ever had. \\n\\nRight before leaving I asked the bartender for a piece of coffeecake to go. He was really accommodating and I appreciated the order. Doesn't seem like the type of establishment with very many to-go orders. The coffeecake was pretty underwhelming as well and I thought a bit pricey at $6 for a teeny, tiny slice. Although I didn't mind the small size, as after a bite or two it went into the trash. \\n\\nI'd very gladly go back to Toro Bravo and would still check out Tasty n Sons but it's doubtful I'd come back to Tasty N Alder. Portland has so many good restaurants to go back to a mediocre one."},{"name":"Chef Orlando's Bistro","address":"1473 Schrock Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"I loved this restaurant until last night.  It was the worst customer service experience I have EVER received in a restaurant.  There is so many things that went wrong but I'll try to summarize it quickly.  \\n\\nOrdering:\\n\\nWe asked if they had wings, she had to go back and check and there weren't any.  We asked if they had a certain potato dish, she had to go back and check and there weren't.  They were out of most desserts.  It appears they never have anything in stock and the waitress did not know what was available.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 pizzas and 4 dishes which comes with 8 sides and 1 large side... what do we receive: 2 pizzas 6 dishes, 12 sides and 1 large side of something we didn't even order.  I think we were very clear on what we wanted and she never repeated back our order.  The funny thing is we didn't even argue this point because everyone was loving the food which took a good amount of time to make but thats fine, the food was great. \\n\\nThe worst part of the experience was getting into a 5-10 minute argument with the chef.  The young lady asked if I had a groupon and bring it up on my phone and click on redeem.  She takes my phone to the register then comes back only to tell me she can't accepted it because its no longer displaying on the screen.  Groupon has now changed their app to where once you click on redeem and switch screens, you cannot go back to the bar code to take down the numbers.  \\n\\nThe young lady mistakenly switched screens.  The chef and I get into an argument and I stated that on my phone it says USED on Jan 4, 2013.  We kept going back and forth and I kept having to explain that she saw me click on redeem and had to go through a play by play telling them how she took my phone after it was clicked.  Finally after 5-10 minutes I said the young lady saw me click REDEEM and she acknowledge this fact and the chef and his assistant say we are ok and there is no issue, as long as REDEEM was clicked and she say, we are good.  Unfortunately she never spoke up until I went through the play by play... \\n\\nLike I said the food is amazing but I would call ahead of time to order, make sure they read your order back to you , take screen shots of your groupon bar code, be ready to wait longer than expected for your food.\\n\\nAlso if you eat there, keep your jackets on...

This place robbed us. The servers were very nice. My in particular was a gentleman. He deserved a good tip which we did not give because of the food service. They charged us regular lunch price ($21.75) which comparing with other asians buffets is expensive already. But I feel like the management of this restaurant is disrespectful with it's customers. They never changed the food at the buffet. Whatever was there stayed there until the time I left (at 3pm). The chocolate fountain was off. The sushi was old you could see it. The rice was all old and dry. There was no crab and the crab plate was empty and when I asked for it they went inside and putted to pieces on the plate. I understand that the place was not busy and the busy lunch time was over but just think about it 2:00pm is still a regular lunch time. I paid the same a person that went at 12pm paid, the difference is that, that person ate fresh and I ate old food. I think they should let the customers know that they were not changing any food on the buffet. At least I would eat on my own risk. Im never going back there EVER. This is so disrespectful.

However, we came for the infamous lobster roll. The fries that is comes with were good, but it seemed like they dumped half of the salt shaker on them. The lobster was chewy and not enough butter to my liking. The roll neither added or subtracted to the dish. The one bright spot was that this lobster roll contained the most lobster - for $29 it better. The scallops were cooked mid rare and seared on 1 side.

Better Jody Adams experiences elsewhere.\\n\\nAtmosphere/Ambiance: Modern meets boston colonial touches. Fairly clean/sleek and warm, comforting at the same time which is hard to do. Respect. The mood of the restaurant was foodie and business dinner.\\n\\nService: Fairly disappointing. It was unclear who our waiter/waitress was between the two people servicing us. The second person seemed to come by, perhaps, because we sat looking for someone to take our order and remove our plates throughout so much of the meal. Of the four staff who came by to remove plates, no a single person asked how any of our dishes was or the meal overall--not even when the check landed. Zipped in and out, my wife barely able to get a word out to order something else by the time someone whisked away a plate. Odd as some of the waiters and waitresses were quite chatty with others around us -- including our one/two. We got there around 6:30 and left around 8, sitting during both busy times and when the restaurant was half-empty.\\n\\nFood: The bolognese -- pasta was very good, the meat and its sauce was a little sweet for some tastes and less sauce and more meat crumble. The portion, as others have noted, was quaint for a full order entree. The scallops were well done (figuratively, not cooking-wise), well salted and crisped on the top and bottom, and the beet puree was a great accompaniment. The passionfruit pavlova was to die for -- gobbled it up in seconds. The shrimp was surprisingly good and the burrata pretty good. The arancini and cauliflower were meh. The artichoke was pretty unappetizing -- they were small artichokes, very little heart, and the outer leaves tough and unpleasantly sharp, not caramelized well. \\n\\nDrinks: I had a nice glass of greek red and delightfully sour raspberry ale. Didn't delve into the cocktail menu.\\n\\nPrice: Besides service, the other disappointment. The price of the pasta portion felt like a gouge at $28. This contrasted with the meze platter which was $28 but about 2' by 4' seemed odd. The mediterranean meze/tapas really added up, too, leaving with what was good food and some highlights but not outstanding like many of Jody Adam's other restaurants. \\n\\nTake-away: Frankly you'd get better Jody Adams food, service, and value at Saloniki than Porto. The 3 for $10 Saloniki deal puts the meze platter here to shame.

I have been dining at this establishment since it was a smokehouse, then the tex mex and now American craft. The beer is selection is tremendous which is why I give one star. (Sweaty Betty was my favorite.) Other than the beer, there is not to much else to compliment. I have had raw food every time I have eaten here. The menu is heavy so I usually order one of my staple favorites, a fish sandwich. I keep thinking my experience is a fluke but now I have to say raw fried fish is the standard deal. I have had the fish sandwich 3 times. I think it used to be a halibut sandwich and now it is cod. Every time is was raw, clear and gelatinous inside.....ewwww completely gross. We also ordered the cornmeal oysters for an app. They also arrived raw, clear, soggy and gelatinous. Yuck. Other menu items I have tried are the Pea risotto, also undercooked with crunchy rice, and the tomato soup which was semi tasty but after a few spoonfuls it tasted like pasta sauce to me. The hamburgers and chive fries are allegedly very good but I have not personally tasted either. Although the service is slow and aloof, they have been very nice when I report my food is not cooked. Because of the frequency of undercooked fried items, I would recommend this venue for beer not food."},{"name":"OAK Long Bar + Kitchen","address":"138 St. James Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I like coming here.

However, when two spots opened up at the bar, the other guests made sure that they beat us to the seats at the bar. We told our waitress that we wanted to wait for seats, but she didn't inquire about it after the other guests rudely skipped ahead of us. The area in the bar is small, and I felt like the bartenders saw us too, as we were standing there for some time. Besides, who would want to stand the whole time when there were perfectly good tables in the regular area of the restaurant? Anyway, I just felt like the staff could have taken better care of us in the area.\\n\\nThe actual dining experience was just fine. The staff were attentive after the earlier fiasco, and we got food off the happy hour menu. My friend got the rice bowl thing, which she thought was too sweet, but otherwise fine.

I have also had the cucumber salad, which is cool and fresh, but needs some lemon juice or vinegar as it's a bit bland.  \\n\\nThe variation in the menu are the sauces.  My favorites are the Cajun BBQ and Ginger Teriyaki sauces.  The Chinese mayo is de-li-cious.  It's probably just mayo with some Chinese five spice, but I like using it as a dip for the sweet potato fries.  I'm not a fan of the sauces with the Chipotle Cilantro schnitzel; again, too bland for me.  \\n\\nThey also have specials, but I have as yet to try one, so be on the lookout for those written on a chalkboard next to the register.

The fries were good, but I didn't love the seasoning they used on them; for whatever reason, I got a slight aftertaste that was not super appealing. The cole slaw was not too heavy and yet very tasty, and just the right portion. Margarita was also quite yummy- I only got one but I would've had a couple more if I had time haha! (by the way I could really taste the green tea flavor in the marg, so that was a nice surprise!) \\n\\nLast but not least, the service was great. Our food came out quick, the restaurant staff was super nice, and the restaurant was fairly clean overall.

I arrived shortly after 5:30pm and snagged the last seat at the bar (I should note that the restaurant's dinner service starts at 5:30). \\n\\nThe meal that i had was tasty and their cocktail program was great (tasty, balanced). The salmon, although locally sourced, i'm sure, and definitely fresh, was quite literal (salmon on a plank of cedar wood). It was simply seasoned and definitely shined as an ingredient. That being said, for close to $30, you're not going to get filled by that so I'd suggest you get a side or a starter to offset your stomach's yearnings. For my meal I got the corn cake and chocolate potato donut with my salmon. The corn cake's flavor was amazing -- it highlighted the corn but the texture wasn't like a typical corn bread; I'd recommend this. The donut is great too. \\n\\nIf there was one thing that I'd want to improve my experience, I'd say is the expediency in which they service patrons. I went a bit of time between when I asked for something and when it arrived (i.e. drinks), a person a couple seats down didn't receive their food in an appropriate amount of time (the bartender did offer a dish on the house to apologize for the delay) and the person sitting immediately next to me didn't receive his corn cake. That being said, no one was particularly upset and the flavors made up for any delay. \\n\\nTL;DR: -- have a night to spare? Check this place out. Flavorful food, superb drinks but come here casually with time to spare."},{"name":"Jake n JOES Sports Grille - Waltham","address":"70 Market Place Dr","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"This is a great place with excellent service.

How have I been coming to Portland all these years and never once been here?! It is a very good question indeed. Well, my lovely friend who lives here found it on Yelp and we made a mad dash here at the opening bell. It was her mother's birthday and we were going to get a window seat if it killed us. There were about 16-20 other people also waiting at the elevator as soon as the clock struck 5pm. As everyone rushed out of the elevator my friend, who is vertically challenged, was ignored as people hurried to get an open spot. This was a bit dangerous as the restaurant is not well lit. With the bright summer sun pouring in through the windows it can be quite hard to see inside the space. Fortunately most of the groups were larger parties and our little group of 3 managed to find the very last table at the edge of the bar. This was perfect for us as it meant it wasn't quite as loud. We were able to sip our libations, take photos with the view, and enjoy each other's company without being rushed out. \\n\\nIf this review was solely about our server, it would be a 5-star review. She was PHENOMENAL. I wish I remembered her name. In a restaurant where there were probably 40 servers buzzing about, she was a real gem. We were so impressed with her service, we would return for a regular dinner on the other side of the restaurant if she was working over there that day.\\n\\nThe food was excellent, but we all agreed we could have forgone the little dishes and just gone whole hog with the fresh salmon, one for each of us. Instead we shared a little of everything since two of us hadn't been there before. The birthday mom was surprised at the end of the meal with a delicious chocolate dessert with a candle in it.

Since it was relatively new and it the interior looked nice, we thought we would give it a shot . And this is why teachers always tell kids never judge a book by its' cover. The service was absolutely atrocious for such an upscale place. Our waiter was rude and it took AGES for the waiter to even take our order. We waited around 20 minutes for our order to be taken. Our waiter wasn't very friendly to begin with but we ignored it because the guy could be having a busy day. Ironically he was serving the table next to us, a party of 3 caucasian women and he was SUPER nice and perky to them. Maybe he could get more tip from a party of 3? Or maybe perhaps my fiance and I were minorities? Who knows....Then it took another 25 minutes to actually get our food. When it came time to pay, it took ANOTHER 25 minutes just pay for our bill. In fact when I was trying to pay for the bill, the waiter gave us crap about using groupon. I had used the official iphone \\"groupon\\" app to show the waiter my intent to use it. He gives me this bull$hit about requiring a printed copy. I politely told him that this is the official application and that the website said I could present the coupon in this form. In fact I have never had a problem in any other restaurant (and I use a lot of groupons). So he goes and talks to the manager and 20 minutes later he comes back and hands me the bill. Throws it on our table and tells ME to write the groupon number down on the receipt in a condescending tone. I find his attitude simply rude and in retrospect, the 15% tip I gave him only encourage this type of conduct.\\n\\nOur thoughts on the food.\\n\\nMy fiance got the shrimp masala and it was good. The dish was well prepared and both of enjoyed it very much. The shrimp itself was soft and the curry complemented it well.\\n\\nI got the swordfish masala because it sounded exotic. However, it taste average and frankly I would save 3 bucks and just stick with the chicken tiki masala. The fish was tender and the sauce was average.\\n\\nWe were curious about the pizza na'an so we got it. To our disappointment it tastes like bad cheese pizza with LOTS of onions. In fact the cheese and onion overwhelms the dish and it tasted bad. Not worth the money IMO. Our meal costed 60 bucks total.\\n\\nAll in all, the food was ok but the service is crappy and this falls in line with the other reviews. It is safe to say that I would never come here again for food. Why come here when you can get BETTER food at a LOWER price at Mela half a mile away? Get their dinner for two combo and your set.

There are things about this place that I'd rate higher, and things that I'd rate lower... so I'm going to break it down piece by piece.\\n\\nRoof Deck: 3.5-4 stars -- this is awesome that they have a roof deck, it's decent sized, they've got a limited bar that's still fairly well stocked, some fun fountains, comfy seats, etc. The downside - this closes at 11pm and as of 10:45pm they stopped serving drinks up there. Why does this close so early? I have no idea. The other downside, which is just more circumstantial than anything else... no view - or rather, the view is of a building and a highway.\\n\\nUltra Lounge: 3.5 stars -- Nothing very special about this area. It's dark, it's crowded, and I don't spend much (if any) time in this section.\\n\\nBilliards room: 4 stars -- both times I've been here my friends and I have had no problem getting onto the pool table, and then getting to keep it for the rest of the night. I don't know if people are more interested in \\"seeing and being seen\\" but hey, no complaints... more pool table access for me.\\n\\nGirls bathrooms: 3.5 stars -- Generally very clean, and in the bathroom next tot he pool table, they have seat covers that are heated. Seriously? I find this very interesting for a club... but rarely do I ever see bathrooms so clean in an establishment that is in the drink slinging business.\\n\\nPatrons: 1.5 stars -- I felt like 98% of the people that were here belonged on the Jersey Shore. Blowouts, fake tans, steroid juiced guys with shirts with things written on the back that they didn't even know what it said. Seriously, I couldn't read the font on this one guy's shirt so I say \\"What does the back of your shirt say? The King... what?\\" - \\"I dunno\\" - \\"You don't know what your shirt says?\\" - \\"Nah, I didn't care to read it, it's blah blah brand so I know it's good.\\" - \\"I don't know that brand, what if it said something bad?\\" --- this continued and basically he said that he didn't need to read the shirt b/c he trusted the brand and he kept trying to turn and flex his muscles to straighten out the shirt so I could read it, but it was a weird pattern shirt, Old English font, and I already had a few drinks in me.... so I gave up. I will say that although there were lots of \\"ya dudes\\" in attendance, that I didn't feel the testosterone in the room like I normally do when surrounded by these meat heads... like a fight could break out at any time. The girl patrons... skanky. Truly, just dressed with little self worth. I know that when you go out to a club you \\"slut it up a bit\\" and try to channel Pamela Anderson's sex appeal, but no. No no no, keep T and A inside clothing please girls.\\n\\nBartenders: 2.5 stars -- Slow. Need to move a bit quicker to be able to cater to the crowd. Drinks were made fairly strong, and at $10+ a pop I am expecting to get my money's worth with the potency, and there was a nice balance between being strong, but not undrinkable.\\n\\nOutside bouncer staff: 1 stars -- I understand it's your job to keep people in line outside, and make sure that things don't get out of control, but you don't need to be a D-bag about it. Case and point-- someone drank too much, got sick, and needed to leave. I went outside, spoke with a few of the staff (Todd was a gem and he gets 4 stars) about getting her a cab. I go back inside, get the girl from the bathroom, we leave out the side exit, put her in a cab, and a male friend and I are going back in to the rest of the group. Now, I've already been outside once and explained the situation and on the way back in the staff starts yelling (not talking, yelling) at us telling us we can't go back in, blah blah. I explain that we were just bringing someone who needed assistance out to a a cab. They say no again, and start to get a mean mug on, but then I see Todd and he tells them to let us go in and re-explains the situation to them.\\n\\nMusic: 2 stars -- I like that it's not loud, but it's not the style of music that I prefer. They play predominantly techno/house and I would prefer hip hop or at least more of the top 40 music... something with a beat I could dance to vs. pounding my fist and beating up the beat.\\n\\nPhone staff: 1 star -- When I call and ask you about the cost of cover, you should tell me guest list only & give me info to get on it then, not when I find out via a 3rd party & have to call back. I woulda been LIVID had I arrived & got turned away b/c of this.\\n\\nNow... all of this being said the reason I have a good time here is because I'm the type of person that so long as no one is starting stuff with me or getting in my face, I can ignore the crowd and zone in on my friends. The atmosphere of the roof deck, ultra lounge, and billiards area in one place and still being more upscale than you find other places is what I like.

We waited over an hour to get seated just because the only way they were willing to accommodate our group of 10 is in one of the two booths. They were busy, I get it, but there were many tables that can be put together for a big group. The hostess and the waiters ignored the waiting crowd completely. Which, while again, sort of understandable during a busy busy Saturday morning, was also a let down when an hour later the hunger really started to set in and everyone was growing impatient. We did go through our fair share of coffee while waiting too. It may not be a bad idea to run across the street to Grand Central Bakery for a little appetizer if you plan to arrive with more than two people. \\n\\nThat \\"complaint\\" aside, the food was as prompt as possible and as delicious as usual. For small appetites the egg sandwiches are delicious and just enough to give your belly a good feeling, though they're nothing special, and you could probably make 6 of them at home for the same $6. All the other food was tasty and rich, and will still keep me coming back. Many good things are to be said about the lemon ricotta pancakes. Even after Jam expanded the food quality is still as great as I remember when it was just a little tiny corner cafe (which is still there, of course)\\n\\nThe thing of note though are the breakfast cocktails! Yummm! Do ask for the full beverage menu, and enjoy what a full bar has to offer even if it's 10 am.

As we all know, this is a yummy condiment in small quantities, but when blobbed on a sandwich by the quart, one can only think it was done in a passive-aggressive way for asking an hourly employee to do the job they were in fact hired for. The making of the sandwich was like watching a marathon is slow motion -- how hard is it to put sliced vegetables, cheese, and sauce between two pieces of bread? Apparently it's pretty challenging. The sandwich was almost inedible due to the mustard, but thankfully the napkin dispenser was more friendly than the employees, and let me take a handful of napkins to scrape off the mustard without waiting a billion years. \\n\\nThird, most of the employees weren't doing anything other than waltzing around behind the counter, avoiding eye contact with the customers and making grunting noises when spoken with. WTF? I KNOW these kids didn't learn these manners from their parents, and I KNOW that if the proprietor was there, the employees would be buzzing around like happy bees, making delicious sandwiches with their little wings beating to the tune of  \\"It's a Small World\\".\\n\\nFinally, the cashier was incredibly mismatched to her skill set.

Don't get me wrong, the chicken was good, some of the items had good flavor, like the guac. But some stuff, like the lentils, the T sauce, I've had better elsewhere. \\n\\nBeyond that, the downside of this place really is the smell afterwards. That's a big deal for us. We walked out and stunk of JJ's Fusion for the rest of the day. It has to be the way they cook, as their is a just an open flame burner, without a vent hood. This makes for that unpleasant 'smell like what you eat' and with a girl with hair, that's bad. \\n\\nAlso, we were terribly sick the next day. It just did not sit well at all in our tummies and we've head Mediterreanean food plenty of times as well as spanish/mexican.

The menu looks good but I'm not a huge meat eater so it may be awhile before I care enough to try it. \\n\\nDespite the usual wait to get seated, the service has usually been pretty friendly and efficient. My only complaint is that they try to be all Portlandia 'hipper than your regular place' with the salt and pepper, leaving it on the table in tiny bowls to pinch and drop on your food. This would be fine if they were mine individually, and not for everyone at the table, and whoever had the table prior, to stick their dirty fingers and pinch S+P out before me.

The tacos were very skimp on the fish in comparison to usual, tasted more like a mouthful of batter rather than a fish taco. I gave the feedback to the server and she told me the owners were in the restaurant this night and so the chef was adjusting the size of the fish fillet to meet the required serving for the dish (at the request of the owners). I visited the Local again today, they have changed their menu and the fish tacos are now $15 for two fish tacos. I ordered these as I thought if the price has increased, the quality of the dish must have improved. This wasn't the case. The two fish tacos had even less fish than my previous visit - the majority of the taco was filled with salad and mayonnaise.

The place was packed. You line up at the counter (and out onto the sidewalk) and place your order with a very friendly wait person. The line moves fast, but getting your food is not quick (do not mistake this place for fast food).  We waited so long we could have made the biscuits ourselves.  While we waited we could observe the place--there is a long counter filled with eaters that overlooks the grill and the kitchen. Here you can watch the fresh biscuits come out on big trays and get wiped with butter, the corn dogs get freshly dipped and fried and the sandwiches get assembled. This is a busy place and the guys work quickly but it still takes a VERY long time. There are several crowded indoor tables and a small outdoor patio. We got our food to go.\\nOur order was influenced by the fact that we were taking it to go. I asked the waiter one, what was most popular (the reggie--see a picture on their website), and what was good for eating on the run (the Mcisley and a corn dog).  Everything was good, quite good really, especialy when hot. However, if you wait the food kind of gets gelatinous and isn't as good.  The Reggie is very good but the chicken is so tasty that all that other stuff is over kill. I didn' teven remember there was bacon on it until I read th eother reviews.  And the gravy just does battle with it (order biscuits with gravy if you want gravy).  The McIsley is chicken with pickles and mustard and its less messy but you don't really taste the mustard.  Chicken is crispy and pepper and very good.\\nAt the other Pine State we had biscuits and gravy, biscuits and strawberries and whipped cream (fantastic) and the hash browns with onion and mushrooms and lots of other yummy stuff. That was my favorite thing. I could have eaten several of those.  Again, everything was great immediately, but it suffered over time.

Good variety and quality, awesome for sushi lovers like us (not the best sushi in the world but it is an all you can eat!), the price is amazing for the quality, the ambience is nice and the staff are friendly.\\nBeing five we could eat a lot without spending a lot. If i went to Orlando again i would definately visit this place more than once, being the best quality price balance we could find.\\nBesides eating all the sushi and sashimi you can i would recommend you tried the fried frog legs and mac and cheese they are amazing!"},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"FORGET CHIPOLTE! This place is the real deal. Owner is a healthy guy who uses his moms recipes to open a healthy but delicious alternative to fast food chains for the masses. He has a blend of Mexican and Mediterranean food. You can order a Mexican bowl like CHIPOLTE  but it is so much better. The pork is flavor-able and has a subtle complexity. Tastes amazing! The chicken is flavored with lime and other spices. You can chose three rices. I chose the Spanish version which is spicy good!!!! You can get the other rices which I bet are tasty but not spicy. The guacamole is homemade and fresh and light! I topped  my bowl off with a homemade chimichurri bursting with cilantro!    If you like tabouli, he makes a simple recipe that is light, healthy and again fresh fresh fresh!!! The hummus is not made with tahini for you traditionalists and is not pur√©ed. But you can really taste the chickpeas and is still extremely good! You must try it."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Being a big fan of Lobster rolls - I would have thought a 5 star for this place would have been guaranteed. Sadly not.\\n\\nWe came here around 7pm on Saturday night and was told that they were not longer taking customers for the night as their \\"wait list\\" was too long. Was a bummer but on Sunday morning we were determined to come back. We came around 11am (place opens at 11.30am) and there were already around 30 people waiting in line. The first 20 got seats and the rest of us put our names down and was told they will call us when its ready (an hour to an hour and a half wait). We were called back by 12.30am and was seated promptly. \\n\\nStaff: Everyone was knowledgeable and friendly. Made sure our water was never empty and our experience did not feel \\"rushed\\".  \\n\\nFood: We ordered some oysters and shared a lobster roll platter (lobster roll + french fries). Coming from NYC - the head to head comparison of this place will be Luke's lobster. And the winner was Luke's lobster. Although his place had better french fries, the lobster was just not as sweet or soft as Luke's. Also, Luke's bun was 100x better."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],L={key:0},G={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",G,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const D=c(N,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-08e76548"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/57.md","filePath":"quotes/57.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/57.md"},V=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(D)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
