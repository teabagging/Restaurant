As far as I'm concerned, vegan-friendly barbecue is just as egregious as non-alcoholic beer or sugar-free chocolate. Let's stop the insanity, folks.\\n\\nFood: Burnt Fork offers a decent selection of traditional southern barbecue fare such as beef brisket and brunswick stew, but they also offer more novel options such as Korean barbecue tacos and Yucatan-style Barbacoa. Sauces include vinegar-based Carolina, sweet Memphis, and smoky Kansas City options. During my visit, I opted for the traditional offerings so that I would have a means of comparison with other local barbecue restaurants. That being said, the offerings at Burnt Fork were largely unimpressive. I started with the brisket nachos, which were overly greasy, meagerly portioned, and completely devoid of flavor. For an entree, I opted for the rib combo plate (quarter rib + quarter chicken) with fries and mac n' cheese. Although I did enjoy the mac n' cheese, which included a nice hint of gouda, the remainder of the plate was perfectly edible, but mostly forgettable.\\n\\nService: I have been in prisons with better service. Although our waitress was certainly friendly, it was more than apparent that she had little, if any, past experience serving tables. Aside from being glacially slow, she was unfamiliar with the menu, left us to find our own silverware, and delivered the checks without first clearing the table. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Casual with little frills. The front entrance of the restaurant is equipped for take-out orders, while a large side room is available for dine-in service. The clientele during my visit was mixed, but included a decent number of families with small children. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced. Starters are $3.50-$7.50, sandwiches (1 side) are $9-$10, plates (2 sides) are $13-$16, and individual sides are $3-$4.\\n\\nOther: Although many would consider it an unwise business practice to include the term \\"burnt\\" in the name of a restaurant, there is a reasonable explanation. The name refers to Burnt Fork Creek, which originates in Tucker and once served as a major water source for the city of Decatur."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!!

I had a great brunch there with two friends on a recent Saturday.  We pulled up around 10 am and there was no wait.  They typically wait until everyone has arrived before they seat the group.  \\n\\nThe space is adorable.  It looks like an old garage turned into a restaurant. You can see the old remnants of equipment especially if you look at the ceiling. There are antique signs hanging everywhere, tons of natural light and a darling lunch counter.  The only odd thing is if you sit in the front there is an interior window to the rest of the restaurant.  People can sit an a quasi bar facing that window i.e. looking directly at you.  This made me feel a little weird, but I got over it. \\n\\nMy meal was fantastic. I order an omelette with caramelized onions, spinach and Swiss cheese.  It comes with a side of corn grits or hashbrowns as well as white, wheat or gluten free toast that can be substituted for a biscuit. The omelette was cooked perfectly and so flavorful.  They have a ton of filling options for the build your own omelette. The grits were also really good and had actual pieces of corn in them.  The toast was standard and came served with a choice of strawberry, blackberry or peach jam that tasted very homemade. The biscuit I tasted was also excellent, but it tasted more like cornbread.\\n\\nWhite Folk Art is very affordable, I do think the pricing on the menu is a little confusing especially in the egg breakfast and omelette sections.  We figured it out, but had to ask a few questions.  Our waitress was really friendly and accommodating. Parking is simple and free in the huge lot behind and to the left of the restaurant.

When I walked in I was hankering for a cheesy omelette, but I got sidetracked with the special of Stuffed Challah French Toast.  It promised me fresh peaches which I'm a sucker for, so I abandoned my original desire for bacon.  Always a bad call to forgo bacon, clearly.  It also listed fresh blueberries and strawberries (I think, really I was only thinking of tart peaches).  After walking out and seeing a different special listed outside (of course with cheese and bacon, grr), I was already second guessing my switched to-go choice, but I told myself that fruit is good too.  Had it actually been recognizable fruit instead of sickeningly sugared compote, I wouldn't be reviewing this right now.  Instead, it was swimming with gelatinous purple cubes which I can only assume at one point were poor massacred peaches.  There was definitely no third fruit, either.  Also missing from the dish was any amount of flavor, but it could have been drowned in the effing compote.  The container was leaking everywhere with the crap which has already put a thick film on my teeth.  Side note, they also put the butter in the box with the mess, it was so slimy and sticky I could hardly open it.  Hate it when places do that... if you're going to put the silverware and napkins in the bag, put the rest of the side stuff there too, not on top of my food!!\\n\\nI've been there once or twice in the past and only remember walking away with a similar of feeling of not quite getting what I hoped for and spending just a little more than I wanted to.  Sadly, this is one of the only places I can walk to from work and get late breakfast takeout on a Sunday in the West End.\\n\\nNow I'm going to be cranky all day about not having bacon, for shame.\\nWhat a soggy waste of challah bread... and $9 :(\\n\\n***Editing this to respond to the Owner Comment that they don't serve fruit from a can.  Fresh implies to me that you cut up the fruit minutes ago and put it in my food.  Not soaked in \\"compolte\\" as it clearly was- I generally think of peaches being orange in color instead of purple as you can see from my picture.  The third listed fruit was still missing and this wasn't a regular menu item that needed to be taken off, it was a special that I walked in and saw on the board.  Plus, I work off of New Chardon St which is a pretty quick walk for the complexity to have become so soggy. \\n\\nHowever, thank you for actually responding and thanks even more for having an eclectic menu and being open on Sundays for take out, it's a hard area to find a quick lunch I can run back to work with.  Maybe I'll come back and try a burger some weekend, but I found a breakfast fix that fits my time constraints."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The service here was lovely and I wish I could do better but the entire appetizer and main course had strong flavors.

I decided I needed a re-do for my birthday this year.  As someone who grew up about 45 minutes from Boston, it seemed overdue to go to Top of the Hub.\\n\\nI should let you Yelpers know that Atlanta has a restaurant called Sundial that features a glass elevator ride to the top and is 72 stories up, plus has a rotating dining room, so our standards might be a bit high having gone there a year or so ago\\n\\nMy husband and I got up to Top of the Hub after an ear-popping elevator (not a complaint!  I think that's kind of cool!) ride around 6:00PM on a Thursday night.  We warmly greeted the hostess and asked for a seat in the lounge.  She essentially said, \\"Hi, we have a minimum of $24 per person in the lounge\\".  I let her know that wasn't posted anywhere and she responded, \\"We've changed the policy\\".  Well, five days later, their website still states \\"Q: Does the lounge/jazz music have a cover charge? A: No, but after 8pm the lounge tables do have a minimum spending requirement of $24 per person for food and beverage.\\"  Again, this was 6:00PM.\\n\\nBut whatever, it's my birthday week.  No biggie.  We weren't doing food anyway and I think I misunderstood what the lounge was anyway.  She let us know we could sit on a couch (there were a whopping two -- both taken) or at the bar.  So we sat at the bar, were addressed by some put-out-seeming bartenders, and ordered our drinks.  The drink selection was relatively uninviting -- one or two local beers in a small pond of mass-produced junk beer, wine ranging from semi-reasonable to absurd, a few cocktails.  Again, birthday week and I'm stubborn, so my husband ordered the least-lousy beer option, I grabbed a glass of bubbly, and we decided to walk around checking out the view rather than dealing with the attitude from the bartender.  I can't speak for the food, at all, other than to say the offerings did not excite me.\\n\\nThe view *is* lovely.  And despite this fairly negative review, I'm glad I went.

I ordered the Florida frog legs, which were tender and flavorful. Really does taste like chicken... The garnishes were pretty yummy, too. My entree was a swordfish steak, which paired well with my Chenin Blanc. The fish was almost like a chicken breast in texture because of it's meatiness and density. At times it got a little dry, but the sauce always sopped it up. The short rib was random but a nice touch to the dish. The server came back periodically to check up on us, even brought us extra bread at some point at our request.\\nMy tab came out to be about $55 including wine, my appetizer, and entree, which isn't all that bad for what it was. I'll definitely have to make it out here again one day to try the oysters!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"5* for donuts, 1* for crazy waits.

For my entree I had the fried chicken with a side of fried green tomatoes and Mac and cheese. The fried chicken was very on point. The meat was moist, tender and juicy however the taste of the skin was a little on the heavy side. The fried green tomatoes were actually good especially when dipped in the white sauce they give you.

When we finally got inside, it felt dirty and we were overwhelmed with choices (none of which looked good to me, but I'm not big on donuts). My son could hardly contain himself. Rather than stress over all the options, I just ordered a Voodoo Dozen for $15. Beware, they take CASH ONLY. The chick took my money then went to the back to select my dozen. I had to remind her to give me my change when she came back. I grabbed my pink box and went back to the car where we would \\"see what we got.\\" \\n\\nNow, I always thought that a dozen equals 12. I have heard of a \\"baker's dozen\\", which is 13. But I had no idea that a \\"Voodoo Dozen\\" equals 8 (eight). I don't know if this is normal, or if our cashier didn't know how to count, but I wasn't going back in to correct it (most of them went in the trash anyway). \\n\\nMy son took a huge donut with fruit loops on top, he only eats sugar willingly, so this was right up his alley. He ate about 2/3 of it. My daughter got a chocolate donut with pink frosting and marshmallows on top, this was her first donut and she was happy and ate about half of it. My boyfriend got a huge donut with peanut butter, which he said was too sweet (but he still ate it). I got what I thought would be the safest choice, a donut with white icing and shimmery purple sprinkles. It was so sweet, I took a few bites then threw the rest away. \\n\\nWe closed the box up, and the next day the donuts were stale so into the compost they went. \\n\\nSo, we came, we saw, we won't come back.

Some people like that but if you don't be prepared. Jazz music gives a slightly more upscale feel than what it is, which is firmly in the fast casual category. As a result the service reflects that. An interesting part is the random yelling of Japanese phrases from the waitstaff echoed by others around the restaurant before everyone's heads quickly duck down again and resume slurping. Many individual diners on the larger communal tables, but also larger groups on separate tables. No alcohol, which is a bummer.

I definitely recommend getting here no later than 5:45 if you don't want to have to wait. \\n\\nWe ordered a lot of different plates to split and they were all pretty incredible. First off, we had the fried oysters. The breading on them was crunchy and perfectly spiced and they weren't greasy or heavy at all.  \\n\\nNext, my friend and I split the crab toast and the soft egg toast. Soft egg toast definitely won. It was beautifully plated and tasted just as good as it looked. The egg was cooked perfectly. The crab toast was good too, but I feel like the other stuff on the toast kind of overpowered the crab. \\n\\nMy other friend ordered the roasted parsnips and broccolini and they were incredible. I was blown away. I LOVE vegetables and these were prepared so amazingly well. I wish i could eat them every day.\\n\\nFor my entree, I got the hanger steak which was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The sauce on it was awesome ( I believe it was chimichurri). My friend got the charred octopus which was heaven.. but the portion was a little small for the price. I'm not a huge octopus fan because it can be tough and chewy if it isn't prepared correctly, but this one was perfect and beautiful to look at. \\n\\nWe ordered 4 desserts (don't judge us)\\nBirthday cake ice cream sandwich- I don't like cake, but I loved these! \\nCoconut ice cream with chocolate chunks ( my vegan friend got this one and it was amazing) \\nChocolate and Rye - freaking delicious\\nHazlenut Layer cake - this one wasn't my favorite.. it just had too much going on for me and it just wasn't balanced\\n\\n\\nOur waiter was not the most friendly/helpful and  he definitely judged us for ordering 4 desserts (RUDE) because he made a comment about it that we didn't appreciate.

This already sparked my curiosity because for one, I love donuts, and second, because a donut shop appeared as a destination that I should attend. \\n\\nI stumbled upon this place on accident with my mom when we were in Chinatown. One of the owners in one of the shops said that we should go and try out their donuts, and so that is what we intended to do. When we got to the shop, the line was busting out of the door and onto the street. I was shocked at the length of the line, but at the same time, when you see a long line of people, there is a reason for the line. I ended up waiting in line for about 30-45 minutes I would say and the menu is very intimidating and overwhelming at first if you have never been there before, so take a look at the pictures of the menu because the items on the menu are very unconventional. \\n\\nWhen I got to the front with my mom, they had a convenient revolving case of the donuts they had, so if a description on the menu doesn't do you justice, the look of the actual donut will (well, taking a bite of the actual donut will really be the thing to do the look of the donut justice, but that's the next best thing at that point.) I was using the menu based on the description, and my mom was using the revolving case. My personal favorite was the Memphis Mafia, but that will set you back about $4.25. From want I remember, that was the fritter covered in chocolate glaze with Oreos, peanut butter, and chocolate chips covering it. That was definitely something you can't find at a normal donut shop. They also have a maple bacon bar donut people like, and I enjoyed that as well. They also have various donuts with cereals covering the donuts and I have only heard of a handful of places doing that before. I just suggest going to the front, look at the menu, and look at the revolving case, it's a whole different ball game when you actually get there. \\n\\nI recommend visiting this donut shop if you are a donut fanatic like I am, or if you just want to try something new out in Portland on your spare time. If you happen to go on a Saturday or Sunday, you'll catch the Saturday Market as well, but that's a different review for a different day."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is probably 3.5 if you consider launderette outside of Austin, but within Austin (and I assume Texas in general) it is a bright shining star for new American/ California cuisine. \\n\\nWe were recommended to go here by a friend who used lived here, and from our uber drivers reaction it is known as one of the nicer restaurants in the city. \\n\\nI called ahead to try and make a res, but of course they could not accommodate. They recommended we come anyway as they had an outdoor space for cocktails etc while you wait. This whole no reservation thing ended up working well since we didn't end up arriving until about 9:30 pm and there was tons of space. \\n\\nSpeaking of space, the outdoor seating is beautiful. Really this is what caused me to round up star wise. The wood bench which runs the length of the patio was perfect for a warm austin night, and I could see returning for that alone. It was so quiet and beautiful since the restaurant is off the beaten path and almost in a neighborhood, we got essentially zero foot traffic. It just felt like a romantic culinary oasis ;)\\n\\nFinally, to the food. It was all very good (picky details below) but the cocktails were super (really interesting), I had some sort of ginger lemon gin drink (akin to a bees knees) and my boyfriend had a mezcal negroni which he seemed to thoroughly enjoy. \\n\\nCarpaccio - overly spicy, although we were warned about this and not cut thinly as with traditional carpaccios, it was cubed, so it felt closer to a ceviche or poke \\n\\nBurrata - good but the sauce it was sitting in, I found to be too much as well as slightly too sweet, but that's a matter of preference\\n\\nChicken thighs - spice rubbed, very small (came with two stacked in the bowl) overall just nothing special and def not worth the $20 price, most disappointing item. \\n\\nBrussels and Zucchini - both very good, no complaints. I would highly recommend going big on the vege section and apps/ possibly skipping the \\"mains\\" although the chicken def was not a main in my book. \\n\\nThis brings me to dessert. Their desserts all seemed very interesting, but we saw the birthday cake ice cream sandwich and decided to go with that (whimsical right?) anyway, my boyfriend couldn't stop comparing it to a chipwich and to be honest I was pretty disappointed. The ice cream within was very salty, and it did feel like something that could come in a plastic wrapper. I think the other desserts could have been lovely, so I do wish maybe the waitress would have prefaced what we were going to get so we might have changed course. \\n\\nOverall launderette is a great stop if you're in Austin and looking for new american set in a hipster space (which I always am)."},{"name":"Sun Tong Luck Asian Cuisine","address":"2500 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"As seems to be the trend with my wife and I when we go out to try a new place for lunch each week that we're off together; We found ourselves in the Carrige Place vicinity pushing the late lunch early dinner time frame by the time we got done with our chores/errands (we both work predominantly second shift hours any way so we're used to eating later than most). It was between Bollywood Bistro and Sun Tong Luck and we weren't really feeling indian food. So we gave Sun Tong Luck a whirl.\\n\\nI have to admit I rolled my eyes a little after looking at the menu posted on the door that was complete with questionable use of english (kinda like my reviews) and a typed up paper sign below it claiming their General Tso's and Sesame Chicken were the best in the city. We almost turned around and walked down to Bollywood Bistro. I am very glad we didn't.\\n\\nWhen you go inside it looks just like any one of hundreds of other chinese take out places in Columbus. It's got a small dining area with a mix match of different style tables laid out in front of a counter that leads directly back into a small kitchen. Above the counter is the typical menu board with pictures of popular items printed out on computer paper. It's no Hunan Lion when it comes to dining room ambience. When it comes to the food it's more.\\n\\nWhat sets this place apart is what's going on in that small kitchen behind the counter. The food is excellently prepared and very fresh. As the owner enthusiastically put it when I went back to the counter to compliment her on how great my meal was: \\"We take no shortcuts!\\" If that doesn't seem like a big deal to you then you're probably one of the people who assume (wrongly) that most places you eat (except for fast food) are preparing most things from scratch. They aren't. The chef as well as ownership of this place are not only very friendly, but they also clearly have a passion for what they are doing that shows in their food.\\n\\nEven though I didn't really take it seriously at first I was still pretty much taunted into ordering the General Tso's by the sign on the door. The sign is not false advertising. It is the best in the city that this Chef has had. The chicken is hand cut and battered chicken, not the processed pre-battered chunks most places use. It fries up to a nice and thin but crispy shell on the tender pieces of chicken. Given the thin nature of the batter I'm not sure how well it would hold up if taken for take out, but it'd still probably be better than most. The sauce was delicious as well, not as spicy as I'd like, but thats an easy fix. It didn't taste like the corn-syrupy pre-made brown sauce based sauces that many places use.\\n\\nThis (and the last review I did for Taste of Bali) are a reminder to heed the old saying; \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\". A restaurant may look like a cookie cutter strip mall joint, and if it does, it probably is, but it never hurts to try it out anyway.

What I find interesting is many of the doughnuts have been updated with some of your other favorite breakfast items (Bacon, Tang, Cereal, etc), so you can have your doughnut and eat it too.  I had the Bacon Maple Bar - which looked better than it tasted - I'm a big fan of the Maple Bar, but the bacon was a little hard and didn't bring out the taste against the maple very much.

When I asked about it, they told me corporate had literally changed it that day. I don't like it. Minus 2 stars. It tastes really limey and sits differently in your stomach.\\n\\nI haven't tasted the other bowls since the change, so I dont know if it was only the Spicy Miso that was changed or if they all got a revamp. Personally, the Spicy Miso is what set this place apart for me. Couldn't find that flavor anywhere else, and now I can't find it at all. :(\\n\\nI used to be able to justify the $13 spent on it because it was amazing, but for what I got today, not worth it. Minus a star for price point and a star for the bowl itself. \\n\\n\\n9/9/2016 Okay, so preface. I'm from Southern California and I just moved here 3 months ago and the boyfriend and I were looking for something that compared to the delicious ramen you can get on almost any block of Sawtelle in LA. We came across Jinya after trying a few other places in ATL.\\n\\nThe first time we went, I got the Premium White Tonkatsu, which left something to be desired and my boyfriend got the Cha Cha Cha ramen, which was tasty but still not my speed. \\n\\nBUT, the next time I came and ordered to go, I got the Spicy Umami Miso and let me tell you, that shit is amazing. I absolutely love the thick noodles in that rich broth. It's not overly spicy which is great because a lot of ramen places will skimp on flavor if they can just drown you in spices and heat. When I get home I sometimes add a dab of chili oil, and it doesn't bother the complex flavors at all. Always always always add that delicious tamago. I don't think I've ever had a ramen place consistently make the perfect marinated soft boiled eggs EVERY DAMN TIME. Hats off to whatever employee is in charge of that. I could legitimately go in and order like 10 of just the eggs. It's just enough bean sprouts without them getting annoying and the Bok choy is always clean. \\nThe ground pork in the spicy miso is just as, if not more flavorful than the soup itself! I got some on my lunch break and my coworker didn't understand why I spent 14$ on ramen when it's 25cents at Publix and I had him taste it and I changed his life. Seriously, he'll never question me again. \\n\\nI think one of the girls in the front knows me by name. I go at least once a week. If you get a call for a spicy miso with egg and extra noodles, there's a fair chance that my name will be on the bag!\\n\\nGo get it, don't play your tastebuds."},{"name":"Merrill & Co.","address":"1 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The hipster dark diner look doesn't really jive with the menu, which itself is a bit all over the place from raw bar to southern friend stuff to BBQ.

She ended up bringing me \\"more salad\\" \\n\\nI don't know why I asked her that simple question because she was completely confused as to why I wanted to change my wilted onion side salad they gave me for French fries instead. The salad was terrible and looked dated. After all the confusion I just made things simpler by keeping the gross salad and ordering a side order of fries. \\n\\nThe manager however came over and after asking me what my issue was and me explaining and showing him what the issue was he proceeded to say \\"you seem angry\\" and \\"why was I insulting his salad\\" ... angry? and insulting a salad, really??? \\nConsidering the fact that I was completely calm, not yelling, not anything just explaining what the issue was as he asked.  \\n\\nAfter him being the one that was actually \\"angry\\" and verbally aggressive going back and forth with me as to why I was \\"insulting a salad\\" that was terribly prepared, I literally had to take a deep breath and calmly ask for an entire refund because it was obvious where this situation was headed and I wanted NO parts of it, I just wanted my refund so I could get the heck out of there. I'm quite sure he would've sat there and argued and continued to be verbally aggressive completely disregarding the fact that I had done nothing wrong and I am a paying customer whom frequents a lot. \\n\\nAfter the manager stated that he just \\"cancelled\\" my card so I wouldn't be charged was completely false. I exited the building and checked my bank statement and sure enough there were two charges on my card one for $12.46 and the other for $3.26 and neither were credited back or \\"cancelled\\" as he said they would be. I had to call my bank to reassure those charges would not go through. \\n\\nThe $12.46 was eventually credited and the $3.26 was not. The manager's customer service was terrible and the way he spoke to me as a paying customer whom frequents the restaurant often was completely unacceptable and unprofessional !! \\n\\nBottom line is this: if your food isn't presentable or even eatable don't sell it and certainly don't cop an attitude with a customer about something that was in your staffs control and refund monies owed to a customer for food that was not taken. \\n\\nI hope you used the $3.26 for a tip and hopefully you'll have better customer service with others. The sad part about it is: absolutely nothing will be done about it and business will run as usual with the manager being temperamental and possessing a horrible customer service attitude with whomever he chooses with zero consequence because it is evident this isn't his first rodeo after reading several other reviews in regards to the \\"manager\\" being rude. \\n\\nThe great part is not only will we take our business elsewhere we will also tell others to do the same eventually word of mouth goes a long way and in no way is this intended as an attempt to try and hurt your business because that is nearly impossible.

My noodles were truly al dente, a lot firmer than most places serve their pasta, but I appreciated the fact that they were cooked properly. I'm a pasta connoisseur, but it felt right if that makes any sense. The pasta flavours were also very good. My favourite item was the meatballs, but as you may or may not know, I've got a thing for meatballs. The pork belly, although tasty, I felt like I could have done without having it.

I got a Dublin Dr. Pepper and my son got a beer. The beer was a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  He liked it. We also got waffle fries.  The dogs were good but would have bee better if they were warm, they came out cold and the bun was not even toasted or steamed.  Strangely enough the waffle fries were good when I dipped them in ketchup.  The cole slaw on the dogs was fine but I like slaw more like normal slaw. I know what normal slaw is. Think about it.\\n\\nWe got the chocolate-covered bacon and the ice cream cookie sandwich with Mexican vanilla ice cream for dessert.

We had steam clams, crispy pork, and vegetables with truffle oil and oyster sauce, and pork buns. I liked 3 out of 4 of the dishes. \\n\\nCrispy pork skin was way too salty for my taste. It was also sitting in a pool of oil which I didn't like. I love crispy pork but I am accustom to those that are served with a little bit of pork meat, not all skin and fat. Too fatty, too oily, too salty (albeit it was very crispy). \\n\\nSteam clams were mediocre. It had a lot of raw garlic in it so I wouldn't recommend it for those on a date! Lol. It was a pleasant surprise that it came with a bowl of white rice which is great with the clam broth. In my personal opinion, it had too much garlic and not enough taste of everything else. Probably won't order it again. \\n\\nMy favourite dishes were the pork buns and the vegetable with truffle oil and oyster sauce. Yummy! Buns were lightly fried but still soft enough on the inside, and the pulled pork was tender and delicious. They give you pickled cherries to clean your palate with the pork buns. A nice touch. As for the vegetables, I'm a sucker for truffle oil so loved it from the get go. Doesn't seem too complex a dish to make but hey, I do love the combination of flavours. Also, the oyster sauce was served on the side so that is perfect for those with different salty needs! :) All in all, I'd go back for the two dishes I liked but similar to other reviews, pricing is a little steep for what you get.

I would totally come back here just for that. \\nserved up with a sugar rim and a cilantro leaf garnish\\nI was so excited to see beef hearts on the menu so we had to get that. It was super delicious!! Cooked perfectly! \\nThe filet mignon tartare was way better than I expected because usually I like it in the French style with the mustard. It was super soft and not chewy. The quail egg that was poured on top gave it a nice creaminess to it.\\nI had the diver scallops and it was very fresh and cooked perfectly. Scallops I've had before at other places are usually salty and too rubbery, but this place does it right.\\nI tried my friends duck leg and it was really juicy too, great flavors. \\nFor desserts we had something like cannolis with mango-lemongrass sorbet and that sorbet was like eating candy, it was soooooo damn tasty! We actually asked our waiter where they get it, and he said they hand make it everyday!! Our friend who lives in Portland got the manager to give her their number so they can pre make it so she can take some home. It's that good! \\nThe fried ice cream with goat cheese was so tasty too. To me anything with goat cheese is good. It does sounds weird, but it always seems to go well, if paired right. \\n\\nThis place is pricey and only worth it if it's a special occasion.

I have, however, eaten many a pizza pie at many a places, including Chicago. I love pizza, who doesn't?\\n\\nThis place is settled off of Austin's SoCo area, nestled in next to their take-out only establishment, and a cupcake food truck. At first glance it doesn't look like it's going to be much, and once you get inside you may at first continue to think that, until you get a whiff of their pizza. This pizza is some of the best pizza I've personally ever had, and they are consistently that good. I've been here a few times now, and each time it's been fantastic. This is not a pizza place for those who are trying to watch their carbs and fat intake though, you can see the grease drip off a slice when you pick it up to put it in your eager face. Let's be realistic though, if you are trying to lose weight or dieting for a competition, you won't be eating pizza from anywhere!\\n\\nThis place also has great salads and appetizers, like their garlic knots, to tide you over until that pizza gets to your table. I can also tell you that their NY Cheesecake, is 100% authentic NY Cheesecake. It's like these guys send a delivery driver to pick some up every weekend or something, it is absolutely the best cheesecake (if you like real cheesecake that flakes and crumbles like cheese is supposed to when you put your fork to it...). I haven't tried everything on the menu, but give it some more time...\\n\\nThe only negative about this place is that there is usually a wait, no matter if it's lunch or dinner. Notice I'm still giving it 5 stars? Some places are worth the wait, and Home Slice is one of them. It might actually be part of their business model to make you wait a little longer so that by the time you sit down, you want to stuff your face... okay, no, it's just a really good popular spot, so more people come here!

For the main course I had the 4 piece fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, sweet potato stroufle, a side of cheese grits and a sweet lemonade and all of it was complimented by a basket of searing hot cinnamon and yeast rolls! First off, the fried chicken was absolutely delicious! It was so tender and juicy. The chicken breast (which is usually the most dry) was bursting with flavor and the seasoning was just right. It was all fried just right!\\n\\nThe macaroni and cheese was the perfect blend of cheesy too and held a sort of creamy/milky texture that wasn't too sharp in taste but wasn't too bland either. Overall, pretty good. The sweet potatoes were just right. The cheese grits were a big disappointment however. I'm thinking instead of white cheese (which to me can be flavorless sometimes) they should have used a sharp cheddar or a combination of both. FYI: I ate the whole basket of cinnamon and yeast rolls if that's any consolation.

We waited around a little while for a table, and had to put up with screaming little brats (one even had a mullet! ::gasp::) but I was going to do anything I had to to get one of those bacon drinks.  It was like Chuck-e-Cheese in there!  Do kids eat free or something?  I couldn't figure out why there were so many rugrats (at separate tables, it's not like it was one big group).  Who brings a baby to a bar?\\n\\nAnywho...we were seated and the waitress finally sauntered over to our table ten minutes later.  My friends gave their drink orders, and then I eagerly placed mine.  All I kept saying during the fifteen minutes that we waited was, \\"Wow, I'm so excited to try this bacon drink!\\".  The waitress came back with two drinks and neither of them was red or had bacon or cheese sticking out of it.  Wait...a...minute.  She turned to me and regretfully said, \\"I'm sorry, we're out of bacon vodka...we're pretty much out of most of our bacon-infused liquors.\\"  WHAT?  How dare you, Frank!  This is what you are known for!  Shame on you.  The waitress asked what else I wanted, and I shook my head and said that nothing would compare to a bacon drink, so just bring me a water.  My friends were laughing at me for pouting and for the fact that every time the waitress came by our table, I couldn't even look her in the eye, like she had seriously wronged me or something.\\n\\nYour Chicago dog was pretty good and colorful, but I'm still bitter.

I called about the burger and was told that the burger would be replaced free of charge next time I visited. Keep in mind that I did not ask for anything free, it was offered. That was nice, so I figured I would give them another shot. \\n\\nFast forward to today, I called in another order. Same thing, wings and a burger. I advised the person on the phone that Jacob offered me the burger for free a month ago. I was advised to bring my receipt and everything would be fine.

She further lectured me that they would replace the burger this time, but once again that I should have asked for management instead of speaking with \\"Jacob.\\" She was snobbish and made the situation seem as if I was asking for free food and that I went around management by speaking with whomever answered the phone.

I digress. Let us talk a moment about an under-hyped Buckhead mainstay. Located behind Pharr Road on quiet Grandview Ave. Located in a small house with an extensive covered porch, Anis is a quaint location that serves lunch and dinner from a small neighborhood location. Even when busy, it never seems to loud providing a wonderful outdoor dining experience, weather permitting. As with any place. Anis does not have the city's most diverse and deep menu however I often find this is the trademark of any serious kitchen. Do a handful of dishes and do them extremely well.\\n\\nMy most recent visit found me at Anis' for dinner, so this review is going to limited to the dinner menu. I started things off with an arugula and artichoke salad, very light fare. I am a much bigger fan of the tomato tartare salad which when delivered resembles a fish tartare or steak tartare but prepared obviously with tomatoes and a heathy slice of mozzarella to top. With the exception of Anis' mussels, the tomato tartare is arguably their signature appetizer. While we are on the topic of the mussels however, this might be the best in Atlanta. Always fresh and always a generous portion, not too rich and just enough garlic. The coup de gr√¢ce is the pommes frites, undeniably the best I've ever had. Flip Burger Botique, and Five Seasons, I still love your take on fries... very very much, but these are something you have to try to fully appreciate.\\n\\nIn terms of entree I decided to do something different; ordinarily I am a hard sell off of Anis' steak au poive but as I had a long night ahead of me and needed to feign staying awake for another 4 or 5 hours after a regular work day I opted for lighter fare with the trout, which I have had numerous times but not recently. Fresh, perfectly golden trout topped with leafy greens and more artichokes provided an elegant balance of flavors without a surplus of bones or oil to detract from the enjoyment or flavor. Barely able to finish the plethora of food before me I did not have a chance to sample any of the dessert options at Anis' this visit.

My husband was not very hungry and ordered a lobster roll. It was a big disappointment - just a bun and too cold, tasteless lobster. I felt that it was definitely missing some flavor and it was not worth the $28 at all. We also ordered tarte tatin for a dessert and it was good, nothing special, but not bad.\\nIf not the lobster roll, I would have given 5 stars.

On the menu, it states in au jus....maybe I should have known, they were going to cut it, to get the au jus out.  But, I hated it.  I wanted to send it back, but didn't want to be that person.  it was also not hot when I got it.  It was warm and tougher than I expected.  I expected it to be tender, succulent, and full of flavor, but it wasn't.  It wasn't good at all.  Maybe this just isn't the restaurant where you purchase a steak.  It isn't a steak house.

Both were tasty, but I was surprised the fries were served with regular ketchup. Just kind of boring. For dinner we got Fettuccine Bolognese and Braised Pork Shoulder. Both were good, but the Fettuccine was incredibly greasy and the bread tasted very much like gas so I couldn't eat it. Also, the proportions were really off.

The little veggie root chip basket is a nice starter. The chips don't taste like root veggies but they are tasty and come with three totally different dipping sauces. For empanadas go with the acelgas. The sugar on the meat empanada is a little weird. The chicken anti cuchos are amazing and even more so with the red pepper sauce. I wish there was a meat option but just chicken, octopus and chicken hearts (no thanks). The octopus is tender and not fishy. Quite good. The purple potato causa with chicken is to die for. Want to go back and try more maybe a full dish to see how they cook meat and fish. I'm sure it will be amazing. So a few little things - wine by the glass, the choices are meh.

They were ahead of the times. Now, every major U.S. and European city has a Peruvian restaurant. What makes Andina stand out is the emphasis on fresh, high quality, local ingredients. They took a page from the culinary playbook of Gaston Acurio and made their menu a \\"new\\" Peruvian experience. To this I mean - the dishes at Andina are just as much fusion food as high-end gourmet.\\n\\nWhat Andina is not is a traditional Peruvian restaurant. I travel to Peru about every-other-month. I have been traveling to Peru for over 20-years. Andina's menu is not traditional Peruvian fare - and this is not a bad thing. It just means that dinners need to know that they are getting a spin on traditional dishes as viewed through the lens of the owners and the master chefs in the kitchen.\\n\\nThe long and short of my review - I adore Andina. The owners, the expert staff, the amazing kitchen, the beautiful apportioned dinning space - everything comes together to create a wonderful evening (or lunch) out. \\n\\nIn a restaurant city like Portland it is really hard to stand out; and, Andina does just that - with class and a wonderful array for flavors.

We had a great time and talked about a wide variety of things like music, growing up on the east coast, our crazy families, and how freakin' good the pizza in NY is.  Needless to say, when I woke up the next morning I had to get me some pizza.  My first thought?  Home Slice!\\n\\nI cruise up S. Congress and saunter into Home Slice.  It's lunch time.  It's crowded.  Fortunately, there are always seats at the counter, which is my absolute favorite place to sit.  Sometimes being a party of one has its advantages.  I sit at the counter and am greeted by a super friendly server, as I always am at Home Slice.  I place my usual order - a slice of Margherita Pizza (fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic and basil) and a 1/2 salad.  As I sit and wait for my food to arrive, I watch the action behind the counter.  I don't know why watching people make pizza is so entertaining, but it is.  I am mesmerized by the sight of pizza dough flying though the air.  As I'm watching the pies being made, my order arrives and is delicious as always.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere in this place is awesome.  They tend to play decent music (although it can get a little \\"clubby\\" at times), the service is fantastic, and everyone seems to be having a good time.  I always end up having random conversations with people at the counter when I'm in here.  Not only are the servers friendly, but the patrons are too.  \\n\\nAlthough it may not be authentic enough for some, and maybe a bit pricier than the slices you can get on the streets of NYC, Home Slice is still an amazing place to go when you're craving a little NY.

To confuse the issue further, the places where you write the food orders doesn't really match the way the menu is laid out either, but it's not a final exam, so good enough.\\n\\nThe sweet breads laid out on the table were very breakfast-ish: sticky rolls, some buttery flat rolls that were almost like a danish, and some dry little cornbready muffinettes.\\nThe size of the entrees seemed small to me for the price, but some of the food I got was excellent.  The small bowl of chicken and dumplings was delicious, and I had never had tomato pie before.  If you haven't, imagine someone making stuffing out of veggie lasagna. Decadent!\\nThe fried green tomatoes were overbreaded and tasteless, and the fried okra... well, I can't complain about that, it was no more and no less bland than any other fried okra.\\n\\nWe didn't have dessert, so maybe we missed out on one of their strong points, but all in all it just seemed overpriced and undervalue.

The citrus marinade paired with the various seafood was amazing. We also had the picadillo ascebichado (Peruvian tartare, with a cute little quail egg), empanadas de carne (beef empanada, a nice blend of sweet and savory) and rounded it out with the tabule de quinua (the most beautiful quinoa I have ever eaten) and morada (purple potato with shredded chicken, nice texture).\\n\\nEven though we ate all these delicious flavorful dishes, the fare is lighter than most restaurants so we didn't feel full to the point of self loathing.

My friend and I ordered about 5 small plates, a dozen oysters, and an entree. Every dish was SALTY SALTY SALTY and OVER-SAUCED.  Octopus leg? Not impressed. Curly Kale? Not impressed. Beets? how is it pink rather than red? tasted like potato wedges. Mushrooms? Grilled and salty. Scallop entree? came out lukewarm and scallps were overcooked and salty. \\n\\nChefs in this restaurants must have no tastebuds. They just mask the dish with hella salt and not much flavor. Perhaps they're trying to mask the not-so-fresh seafood taste. I was excited about this place after reading the reviews but every dish was a disappointment. \\n\\nWhat was more frustrating was that for some reason, there were 2 servers to our table and they took turns every 5 minutes to come by and bother us about whether we were finished with our dishes. My conversation got interrupted literally every five minutes with 2 servers alternating and coming by the table and pointing at the dishes that still had food left in it asking \\"are you finished with that & may i take that out of your way?\\"......dude, if i still have half the food sitting on the plate, we are probably still working on it.  \\n\\nThe question of whether they can take a dish away was soooooooooooooooooo freakin often (literally every 5 minutes) that i was beginning to wonder if they were running out of dishes in the kitchen and perhaps they needed to get the dishes from the table back to the kitchen fast.  I had no clue why they were being this way. It was super bothersome and after about 20th time of 2 servers coming by the table to take our plates away that still had food on them, I just gave up, mentally threw my hands in the air in disbelief and said \\"yes, we are finished with everything\\" when we still had 3 plates of food that we were still munching on occasionally while conversing. \\n\\nWhat the fuck was up with these servers?  There is a fine line between good service and straight up annoyance with too many interruptions by servers. I've never had to be bothered so much by the servers before and this place just went way beyond over the top. Buy some more plates or stop having 2 servers man the table with just party of 2! It was beyond ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nOverpriced, overhyped, no good food, creepy servers who try to take your plate away every 5 minutes, valet guys who don't even open the car door for a lady while taking hefty tips, men coming out of women's restroom with piss all over the seat and unflushed toilet.

She had told us \\"please make it Chinese food\\", and I thought this restaurant is close, seems to get good reviews, we have wanted to try it, and now had our reason to do so.  \\n\\nIt's a small place (6-8 differently-sized tables), tucked in the back of a very small plaza, a block+ from Burquitlam Plaza.  I got a good feeling about the decision to try it when we arrived, and even more so when entered -- local neighbourhood setting, small, 'mom & pop' type place, clean and tidy, quiet, and nothing even bordering on fancy.  We arrived shortly after it opened at 11 am, picked a table, I then walked over to the service counter to catch copies of the menu (while a pick-up order was being attended to), shortly after, our server came to our table with cups and a pot of tea, and then allowed us time to fully ponder the quite extensive menu.  I returned to the service counter at one point, asking for some clarification re: a dish I had seen posted in an online review, but could not recall the name.  The chef came out from the kitchen to help me - after a minute of me trying to describe what I wanted to order, he returned to the kitchen and came back with what was the initial makings of the dish - yea, that's it, and told him it would be on our order.  I also asked him if the pork hock/shoulder was 'good to go' at this time of day, and was told it was - yea, that'll be on our order as well.  Personal service, and right from the kitchen, I was impressed.             \\n\\nSo here's what we ordered:  I've arranged the dishes by item numbers as listed in the eat-in menu.  \\n\\n-  cold appetizer:  #2 - sliced pork in chili and garlic sauce -- I had seen pictures of this dish online, and figured going in, that it was a must try.  Yum! it was definitely as good tasting, as it looked in those pictures, and now in-person.  It was a cold dish, with the chili and garlic sauce adding the only 'heat' - and it sure did so, but just enough to bring the taste buds to attention, and not overly so.  Very tasty.    \\n\\n-  beef:  #20 - beef w/ginger and green onion -- lots of very tender and moist chunks of beef, with slivers and slices of onion, and some other 'greens'.  The fresh ginger flavour was there, but not overly prominent.  A well-prepared dish, and a big hit with the three of us.  \\n\\n-  pork:  #59 - braised pork hock/shoulder -- Wow! was the word that came from us when our server brought this dish to our table - had never thought the serving would be this big!  A sight to see, and so tender and flavourfully prepared.  It's a dish we would definitely not order every time (they're kinda 'rich'), but this was a special occasion, and the dish was certainly something special.  Much-enjoyed there, with some leftovers to enjoy here at home.      \\n\\n-  veggie:  #68 - spicy string beans Szechuan style -- a fine preparation - the beans were young, tender, hot, and spicy.  Much-enjoyed.  \\n\\n-  rice:  #89 - shrimp and BBQ pork fried rice -- a flavourful and tasty preparation, and not 'fried'.\\n\\nWe sure enjoyed our dining experience at the New Szechuan Restaurant -- good food preparations, generous portions, and helpful, personal service.

The first time I was ever here I didn't have a smartphone to check what kind of donuts they have to choose from, and I didn't like how we were rushed to make a decision (although I kind of ubderstand that they want the long line to move faster)...

This place is not in the game by comparison and falls short. But, it's stiff competition with two of Atlanta's best around the corner. I will try it again at some point, but both Community Q and Fox Bros sandwiches and sides are much larger. Further, I wouldn't recommend serving a first-time customer room-temperature pork. I know you have to pull it and it cannot get over 200 degrees before drying out, but Community and Fox Bros seem to manage this concept. I'm sounding mean, but this place is good.

I'm still a little new to eating out in the US so maybe this is a thing but first I had to watch a couple who arrived after us get seated after I'd been waiting 10 minutes. The guy didn't even call their name, he just went up to them and said hey follow me I'll seat you. After I'd been waiting 25 mins a group of 3 arrived and were seated right away. After I'd been waiting 35 minutes another group of 3 arrived and were seated right away. I'm sorry, but if you have a table for 2 it should go to the first couple in line, and if you have 2 tables for 3 then you can definitely seat the couple ahead of them in the queue.

For the entree, I went with the Tonkatsu black ramen. It was good but nothing special. The prices here were very fair so I would recommend it for that if you need a ramen fix.

While the place did fill up, it took over an hour to get our food, the waitress was pretty much non-existent, and when a co-worker complained that her taco had almost no fish in it, the waitress just said \\"What? There's fish in there\\".  There was a tiny 2\\" piece of fish that looked like it had been scraped off the grill under a huge pile of cabbage, but the waitress failed to see the problem with that.\\n\\nWhen we were finally able to flag down a different waitress later to ask for our check, the manager brought it and to make it simple, we asked the tab to be split up evenly between 8 of us, rather than separate, itemized tabs for each of us.  Somehow my card was charged twice, for two different amounts. I went to the store to complain, and it turns out they used my card for both mine and one of my coworker's meals. Fine, I can see how that could happen,  BUT, get this, the totals from both his receipt and mine were for $17 and $15.23 respectively, but I was charged $19 and $18.75 from my checking account. So, they overcharged me, despite the amount clearly indicated on the signed receipts. The manager, Tony, was nice enough when I asked him about it and said that he would credit my coworker's total (the $19) back to my account...which never happened. \\n\\nI worked in restaurants for 15 years, I understand how crazy an unexpected rush can be and how quickly you can get in the weeds, but to overcharge customers and then fail to make it right is just flat out unacceptable. \\n\\nMy team has now crossed Hooters off the list as a lunch option."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Decent breakfast at a decent price.

We were greeted and seated cheerfully and promptly, we noticed that the line to wait for a table grew very long soon after we arrived, so good timing. The menu wowed us! So many choices for folks who are vegan and or gluten free. We ordered a mimosa, a creative sake drink with ginger and basil , breakfast tacos and split the Farmers Plate. The drinks were tasty, the tacos were delicious and the tamales okay. Our waitress was laid back and not overly attentive, but we needed nothing so we were fine with that. I'd definitely go back to try some of their other offerings.

We've never been great fans, and so Pei Wei has been near the bottom of our list for some time.\\n\\nHowever, this evening, in desperation for some variety, I suggested we try once again.  I had not had lunch nor breakfast this day, so was pretty hungry, and most anything would have looked pretty appealing to me... but not this sad excuse for Asian food.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was without any sophisticated taste other than MSG and a hint of pepper.  Okay, I could live with that if it hadn't been for the sadly overcooked EVERYTHING... vegetables, rice, meat.. all cooked to within (or beyond) an inch of its life.  Honestly, the chicken in one dish had the taste of soggy McNuggets, and the vegetables were barely recognizable as such.\\n\\nI can honestly say that this is hands-down the absolute worst Asian-style food I have ever eaten, and I've certainly had my share of greasy Chinese joints in my life. \\n\\nApparently Pei Wei is an off-spring of P.F.

The shop itself is famous for its weird flavor options so opt for those because the usual, standard ones are super lackluster like the Bacon Maple Bar where the bacon was rock hard and near impossible to chew while the maple bar was a maple bar. Now, the Dirty Bastard was extremely fun, like a deconstructed Reese's, and is exactly what I would have done as a kid on a lonely afternoon for a pre-dinner snack. The Mango Tango took the crown though with its mango jam filling and a touch of Tang on top that really rounded the overall sweetness perfectly.\\n\\nPricing: Very ridiculous, but instead of thinking about buying normal doughnuts, remember that nowhere else is going to make a doughnut as novel and unique as diabetes on fried dough.\\n\\nService: We only had interaction when we were paying, and it boiled down to the cashier telling us that the Mango Tango was his favorite, which was actually very good so thank you cashier!\\n\\nAmbiance: At a corner with bright neon lights and an obnoxious paint job obviously meant to draw eyes with the same paint job inside on walls covered with merchandise and random clutter meant to break conventional aesthetic norms.

It was also listed on Eater as one of the top 38 spots. \\n\\nMy first interaction over the phone was pleasant, I did not have reservations and they allowed me to walk in with a ten minute notice for a Tuesday night dinner. The hostess was very friendly and got me a table by the window near the bar very promptly. The decor here is beautiful, amber colored lamps give it a cozy warm glow that is relaxing and will put you to ease. The tables are well separated to give enough intimacy for conversations. The place was packed when I went. The only modification I would recommend is expanding the bar area if there is an opportunity. Half the bar has a glass wall which cuts down on the bar space for diners and folks who may want to hang out for cocktails. \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was with the server. I was greeted by one of the servers who told me my server should be with me in a few minutes but almost 20 minutes passed before someone came by and that was the same server who had greeted me originally. He apologized for my server's delay and at which point I told him to ask my designated server to not bother coming to my table. \\n\\nThe kitchen did recognize the situation, thanks to my server and sent me complimentary what looked and tasted like croquette. I started with rellena and tortilla de patata, both were amazing. The huancaina sauce was very well put crafted and put the yuca rellena as potentially the best dish here. Next came the Esparragos Peruanos with chimichurri and trio de papas. The asparagus totally missed the mark. They were over cooked and burnt. I had to separate the burnt parts and put them aside to eat the non-burnt parts and was not flavorful. The potatoes were also fairly average. I closed with the Tabule De Quinua. I had seen this on another table and visually was one of the most uniquely put together dishes I had ordered. The quinoa, avocado, cotija cheese, and olives were properly interspersed and were inverted from a cup to give it a creme brule type structure that stayed together as I carved out of it. It is a very fresh and vibrant dish both visually and to the palate. The dessert was a peanut, caramel ice cream which was very good but not exceptional. It was more on the salty side than I appreciate. \\n\\nSo here is my overall assessment. I think Andina is a very ambitious restaurant, the menu is very well composed, the atmosphere is fantastic, and the overall effort is noteworthy. Where they do miss the mark is execution both in the kitchen and on the floor. In order to launch and maintain your stature as one of the best restaurants it is important to remember how close to flawless you have to be.

First off, let me just say that is some really good French Toast. We didn't get the Fancied Up version with Hazelnuts and such, but just the basic was excellent. They serve basic syrup with it (not real maple like a lot of fancier places do these days), but that's okay, it worked with the French Toast quite well.\\n\\nThe Hash was well received, the Chicken Fried Steak I tried a bite of and found delicious.

The portions were quite small, particularly for entrees hovering in the $12 price range and appetizers ranging from $6-$9. \\n\\nI also found that what I ordered did not include the vegetables specified on the menu. In fact, my entree was devoid of vegetables. When I asked my waiter about it, he just looked at me blankly and walked off. \\n\\nI thought a restaurant this lovely in appearance and at this price point would actually care about whether their customers are happy, but in my experience, they did not. And, despite the room being half full, service was very slow.

We understand that it is Restaurant Week and turnover is extremely important, but the restaurant needs to accept that their patrons will (and should) take at least 1.5 hours to enjoy a 3-course meal! Our appetizers came out within 5 minutes after we ordered, BEFORE the server even brought us our bread bowl! We had multiple servers ask us every 10-15 minutes if we were done eating, etc; at times I felt like I had to physically protect my plate from getting swooped away by an over-zealous server. Worst of all, the server actually handed us our dessert plates before the boyf even finished his entr√©e! If we had eaten at the pace the servers were pushing for, we would've whirlwinded-out in under an hour.

The food is also delicious.\\n\\nI haven't been to the Burnet location, but the new spot on South Lamar is spacious, relaxed, and well furnished. It combines all the hip vibes of a local brewery with the good menu selection of a classier pizza establishment. Just off one experience, I can already say it's a great spot to grab a beer or a pie (or preferably both), take a seat, and unwind with friends after a long day or week. There's a cafeteria-style appearance here, with rows of long wooden tables and benches for seats, but this is the inviting, high-quality adult version of the cafeteria that one could only dream of back in the high school lunchroom. Perfect setting for a weekday lunch, and surely dinner must be a lively occasion here.\\n\\nThe drink selection is sizable. There must have been close to 50 beers on tap, all of them good-looking  local or craft varieties, with a full range of IPAs, stouts, and everything along the spectrum. Now I'm no beer connoisseur, but with a name like Pinthouse, it seems like they deliver on the promise of a more elegant drinking experience.\\n\\nThe pizza delivers too. They have a decent selection of specialty pies, or you can do the old-fashioned thing and build your own. There's a short-term \\"off-the-map\\" pie that changes regularly, and the current one sounded ridiculous - it included alfredo sauce and pasta as toppings, among other things. I ordered a Shroomin' Goat, which as the name suggested included crisply-cooked mushrooms and creamy goat cheese, as well as arugula. It was so tasty, although the arugula really didn't add anything. The crust is the real winner, thick and chewy with that fresh-out-of-the-oven flavor. There's a little too much crust compared to amount of actual pizza toppings, but it still tastes super good. Pizza comes in three sizes here, and unless you have a large group, it's best to order a small because it'll fill you up anyway. For me, it was the best personal pizza I've ever had - a sophisticated, artisan version, all for under $10. Yes, price aside I realize that sounds like a very elitist perspective on pizza. \\n\\nAnyway, Pinthouse is awesome and I'm eager to come back.

There isn't a ton of ginger/garlic flavor in the rice and they skimp on the egg.....but it's adequate.  \\n\\nThe teriyaki beef on a stick is a go to here and should be added to any meal you order.  Succulent and always cooked to perfection, rarely dried out.  The soups I am a little disappointed by, the broths are flavorless and no discerning qualities between all of the offerings, meaning they pretty much all taste the same no matter what you buy.   As mentioned before, fried goodies can be hit or miss.  I need to try some of the chef specialties but some of those are almost double the price of the combo plates.\\n\\nThere may be two or three booths here but I've never actually sat, always take out or delivery.  For two people looking to have a quiet, movie night at home can easily walk out of here with a bill less than $20 and about that when tip is included if you had it brought to your door.  Orders are ready in just 10 minutes and delivery has never once been an issue in terms of timeliness and service.  Plus they take credit cards which is a huge bonus in my book.  \\n\\nI know I can't give a place 3.5 stars but that's really what it is and it is a great and quick takeout place in my local hood with pretty easy parking on Salem St. right out front."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Kevin N., Dude, are you serious?

The food is good, but not *that* good, particularly when cheaper and tastier options are just across the street.\\n\\nThe falafel was the standout of the meal.  Extra crispy exterior and extra moist interior, it was flavorful without being greasy.  The Jerusalem salad was a solid rendition, though again, a meager portion (a saucerful) for the $5 pricetag.  The chicken shwarma sandwich was also tasty, stuffed with warm chicken, roasted eggplant, pickles, lots of creamy sauce, and some fresh cucumber cubes thrown on top.  But for the $10 cost, I would expect freshly made pita, not bread from a bag.\\n\\nThere was nothing wrong with any dish I ordered, and I would happily eat every item again.

The portions are huge though! \\n\\nAppetizers: \\n\\nWe got the mussels- Probably the best thing we ate but nothing impressive. Basically white wine, milk or cream, garlic, butter or oil, etc. standard recipe. Nothing special. \\n\\nCharcuterie- This was like whole foods deli meat on a plate with olives, mustards, etc. \\n\\nMain Course- \\n\\nSalmon- basically they are trying to hit your palette with cold and hot at the same time with different textures plus flavoring of sour, salty, and sweet. Not bad. \\n\\nFilet/steak (whatever it was)- The potatoes that came on the side were good. But the steak was charred beyond enjoyable. Just tasted burnt on the outside. And dry. I know some people prefer that way but I prefer it juicy. \\n\\nWhile eating our main courses,  the restaurant was still empty with just 3 other tables besides us. \\n\\nRight then, a table came in and wanted the table right next to us. Prior to their arrival, I did take a chair from the table next to us to put my purse and big winter jacket on since it would not fit on the back of my chair (the chairs here are small) without touching the floor (the floor which is a patio is brick and dirt). I think sanitation should be understandable, especially at a restaurant no? \\n\\nThe guests for the new table coming to sit next to us snarly remarked \\"looks like we lost a chair\\".

Instead, there went my beige/tan color LV bag on the dirt, brick floor. It did end up getting dirty on the floor as I predicted and I had to take it to get cleaned since I couldnt get the stain out myself at home. \\n\\nI wanted to leave that restaurant right away because I was so upset so we skipped dessert, the hostess (I wonder if she is the owners daughter) ignored me on the way out and I had to get my own jacket off the coat rack in the back, and I had to get my own car after waiting a long time for the valet.

So much so that an annual pilgrimage is made to New York City so that the staff can experience firsthand pizza crafted where it was born. The Pizza pie that arrives is thin crusted with tasty sauce and cheese with just a few added items. That's New York style. I recommend the Number six. A sausage, roasted red pepper and ricotta cheese topped number that is tangy, savory and a absolutely fine bite of Italy via New York and South Congress.

Who knew it was Chinese.  And it is a brick building so black better way above the door is hard to spot.\\n\\nWe sat in the bar area at a table. It was ok in that section. we don't mind even sitting at the bar in most cases.  Anyway, someone outside was smoking and when the door opened a waft of smoke came in and lingered.  There needs to be a sign out there saying no smoking within 100 feet of the front door. \\n\\nWe ordered the ribs.  Generous quantity.  The meat fell off the bones.  But it was too saucy for my taste. I usually like wet ribs (as opposed to dry) but this was a little more than I liked.  Maybe some of the sauce should be served on the side?\\n\\nThe crispy chicken was good.  I was surprised at the \\"popcorn\\" size.  It was good but other than the quantity nothing to write home about.  It had five spice so if you don't like five spice...\\n\\nThe shrimp and chorizo in the curry was also good.  There was something with the sauce and my husband got sick. The chorizo was very good. The shrimp would have been really good if it could have been easily peeled.  it was not split and it still had the legs. So you have to bite off the legs, and create an opening in the shell to peel it off. The shrimp was not quite big enough for it to be easy.  And with the loose sauce, got all over my fingers.  A warning would have been nice and so would have some wet naps. The two slices of grilled toast was nice.  I always like grilled bread...\\n\\nThe Zhi Jiang was ok.  There was too  much salt. The pieces of pork were nice but not enough potato or turnip or whatever.  Again, it was too salty.\\n\\nThe beer list was okay.  The taps were not turned on so we had to have bottled beer, which was Meh.  And the drink list was odd. If you are not into mixing savory into your drinks then don't order it.

Don't get me wrong, it's clean, tidy and the staff was pleasant. It just saddens me when all that attention is put into the ambiance and not as much attention goes into the food. Personally, when it comes to Asian food, I'm a no frills and all about flavor type of a guy.  \\n\\nWe came in on 1/20/17, the front lobby area was packed, people were over flowing out the door.  Our wait was about 30 minutes.  You order at the counter where you can order drinks up front and you just wait like every other popular Portland restaurant.  If you are the unlucky table sitting right in the front where people are hovering over you while you eat, I feel for you.  I got some over priced Taiwan beer and tried to think positively about how amazing these Xiao Long Baos were going to be. I was for sure skeptical. We were called about 30 minutes later and we were sat promptly.  We ordered XLBs, Hoisin Duck Bao Zis, Saut√©ed Chinese Greens, and Shanghai Pork & Shrimp Noodles. \\n\\nXLB's, which are obviously their speciality were extremely bland.  What little soup there was inside barely had any taste and the meat was dry.  Dough was OK but I would agree with one of the other reviewers where they said there was way too much up top but that to me isn't as big of a deal.  If you're going to call yourself XLB, you can't mess up the soup and the meat filling, those are fundamentals of an XLB. The filling in the Hoisin Duck Bao Zis was also pretty dry and the duck filling was also not flavorful. It was SO minced up that it didn't even resemble meat, it looked almost like it came from a can. The rice flour breading was actually pretty decent and moist. Saut√©ed Chinese Greens were under salted and very strong in fresh ginger flavor if you like that. I think the only decently made dish was the Shanghai Pork and Shrimp Noodles.  They were tasty but that by itself it's a reason why I would wait 30 minutes in line and go back. \\n\\nMaybe I have been spoiled with being exposed to really great XLBs and Chinese food growing up. Maybe I should be more lenient because it's Portland and the Chinese food here generally isn't as good as other cities. Even if I have that in mindset, there are some good & tasty places, XLB unfortunately isn't one of them."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been told about this place by a number of former Portlanders and my wife felt it was a must.

Afterward since there is no interior seating we trekked to the bus stop and waited till we hit the hotel before partaking. The location is middle of downtown in a very sketchy area of the neighborhood so if you plan on taking a family then you might want to take your own transportation so that you have a quick escape from the area; this was one of the only areas that I truly feared for my own safety. The donuts were just okay. To be honest, they were better than a supermarket donut but not as good as the donuts I get at my local donut shop so I was somewhat disappointed. If you are not a big donut person then this is a perfect tourist trap for you because they have a number of unique and oddball/gimmicky donuts in which to experience and to overpay for.

The spicy tuna wasn't spicy and I could barely  taste the mayo. The salmon in my salmon tempura roll was really dry in the middle - maybe from being overcooked or previously frozen - don't know which it was. The sushi was just okay, nothing to rave about. The udon noodle soup was sub-par: the noodles were fine but the broth was heavy on the mushroom flavor, salty and unusually thick. The onki mushrooms were still stuck together when my friend fished a bit out of her soup. I didn't enjoy much of the food to say the least. One positive was that there was 8 healthy sized pieces of the spicy tuna and 6 huge pieces of the salmon tempura which left me full.\\n\\nI also went to use their restroom and it had this foul smell to it.

I grew up with Southern cooking from my grandma so I certainly had plenty to compare MM's to.  I had the pot roast and thought it was fantastic.  The meat was oh so tender and the flavor was spot on. I felt like the serving size was just on this side of too small, but most of my dinner mates couldn't finish their meals.  I think what holds me back from five stars are the sides.  While they have plenty of them, they weren't overpowering.  I got mac n cheese and Hoppin John. The mac and cheese was average but not superb.  The Hoppin John was all rice and peas. I couldn't detect any onions or bacon in there. Maybe my thoughts on those two dishes are off, but I think bland is a fair description.  The mixed drinks we got, \\"Harnold Palmers\\" were decent. Mine could have used another shot of bourbon but I could certainly taste alcohol in it.  Our server, Marion, was spot on. She was friendly, engaging and paid attention to our very large table.  I saw a recent post that mentioned racial tension because the restaurant owner is white, the staff is primarily black and because you write your orders down.  Let's not overthink this, folks!  My trip to Atlanta was great because everywhere I went there were black people and white people and people of all other walks of life getting on with their days and ways and each other.  You simply don't see society so integrated - and nonchalant about it - on the west coast like you do in the south.  I never once felt like I was time warping to the 1850's.  As far as writing the orders down, I found it useful. We screwed up and when something didn't come out as we thought it was supposed to, it was quite easy for us to see we never wrote it down. The ambiance is very cool too. I felt like I was eating at my grandma's or something.  I almost felt bad about wearing shorts instead of long pants.\\n\\nI'll go back here next time I'm in town.

While nothing on the menu stuns or reveals, you can expect to find simple, tasty breakfast fare for relatively cheap.  Everything is made to order before your eyes as you move with tolerable speed through the snaking line.  The food comes out hot and fresh off the griddle.\\n\\nThe three of us partook in a spinach feta tomato omelette, French toast with fruit, a side of pork sausage, and the breakfast special, a $5 plate of eggs, toast, and home fries ($6 with a cup of coffee).  Everything was on point, with the exception of the fruit, which was a little bit sad.  The French toast was nice and eggy, the omelette well-textured and flavorful, and the sausage was delicious, with a tight snappy casing.  The breakfast special was a great deal and though it was very basic, it would've made a solid meal on its own.\\n\\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, as most of the menu is easy to replicate and available elsewhere, but The Paramount is a wonderful neighborhood place with a lively but casual atmosphere and great food.

I thought Top of the Hub would be the perfect Boston spot for our last outting. \\nThe five us headed up and planned to sit in the lounge. However, because of some poor service and inflexibility, we never got that chance.\\n\\nThree of us in our group live in Boston and have been to TOH several times with guests. Always a good if-not-great experience (hence, the second star). However, last night was not the case. \\n\\nWe arrived around 9:30pm and stood at the host stand for a minute or two without anyone acknowledging our presence. There was a host on the phone and he appeared to be making a phone reservation. This is fine (didn't expect him to hang up), but he could have given us a simple head nod or mouthed \\"hello\\" to welcome us.  A few minutes later a hostess arrived. I told her we just wanted to sit in the lounge area for some drinks and dessert. Rather than giving us a genuine welcome or seating us, she immediately barked \\"it's a $24 minimum! Is he 21?\\"  We were abit taken aback and told her that he (the youngest member of our party) was only 18. \\"Well then it's a $12 minimum for him\\" she replied.  We paused for a minute to think. \\"Do you want to sit?\\" she asked again.  We decided to leave.\\n\\nI understand the purpose of a minimum and I'm sure it is necessary at a place like TOH, where people come for the view and may only order a soda, but on a slow night with only one lounge table full, I would think that there would be some flexibility.  If there was a line or reservations waiting, I would absolutely understand this policy, but you would think that a restaurant would welcome business on a Monday holiday - especially given the current economy. Granted we were dressed casually and probably screamed \\"tourist\\", but the reality is we  would have ordered very close to the minimum had we been seated and not treated so rudely. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we were all very disappointed.

I have had Carolina Pork It, the Notorious P.I.G., the buffalo sausage, and some others.\\n\\n  Though the fresh made beef & game products are good and the things that pull everyone here, I will spend a moment to tell you about the real things that compliment these dogs & artisan sausages: the carmalized onions & dipping sauces.\\n\\n  I am not sure what  secret recipe or age seasoned grill that they use, but the way they cook the onions and add-ons for these dogs are amazing. Next time you are in, have a great meal.. during your mastication of pleasure.. open your mind to comprehend what your taste buds are telling you about the onions, peppers, or other choice you have selected to be on your best of a dog. You will be happy with what you hear your taste buds say.\\n  As to the sauces, for the fries or the dogs.. my favorites are the Horseradish and the spicy Dr Pepper sauce. They are all good, these are just my faves. The sauces may cost you .25 cents, trust me pay for them.. if you are tight on money.. I will give you a dollar to buy four.. they are worth the charity donation.\\n\\n  I enjoy Frank.

Although it is indicative of the low standards at Scales 925, it was still shocking--classless and ghetto. I should have known what I was in store for the moment I pulled up in my car. There was no valet, and when I entered the parking garage, I had to pay in advance in cash... THIS was my first and last experience, and it was AWFUL. I truly wanted to support the restaurant for various reasons. However, I was disappointed in the food--my waitress was great. My food lacked flavor--a poor attempt at soul food. I ordered the salmon croquette with grits, and a mimosa. My croquette was soggy, and lackluster. It fell apart with every bite, and had no flavor.

The reason/excuse that I was granted for the soggy croquette was that it was made from \\"fresh fish.\\" However, I'm a foodie, and I have a friend that owns a huge chain of 5-star Asian restaurants throughout the country. Being that my visit to Scales 925 was on a Sunday, I know for a fact that \\"fresh fish\\" is not delivered on Sundays--there are NO fresh meat deliveries on Sunday. Thus, my salmon croquette was hardly fresh. To add insult to injury, the mimosa was the worst mimosa I had ever drank.

In addition to the staff typically ignoring my table for any kind of refills, as well as others around me, the staff makes me feel very uncomfortable. Almost every time I visit here, I have a story about these crazy acting employees!\\n\\nFirst off lets start out with the managers. There is only 1 friendly, helpful, and nice manager that works here. I'm sure the owner can easily figure that one out if they care at all. He's consistently nice and doesn't have inappropriate conversation. However there is one guy who I would swear is high on drugs literally every time he works, and another manager who has zero personality and barely speaks to customers, and makes you feel a bit uneasy. The manager who I suspect is on drugs is friendly, but pays no attention to customer needs whatsoever. He's on Planet Coconut and it's a big party when he's on staff.\\n\\nIn addition to the managers, there are a couple of girls who work there who are very moody and act quite nuts at times. Again I'm not basing this off one visit. One time I watched one of the girls banging the tip jar on the counter for a group of 3 customers who were buying their food near closing time. They even made a comment about it to me how weird and uncomfortable it was. I've never seen such a thing. It's funny any employee there would bang a tip jar like that because 90% of the time, you have to walk up to the counter to get a drink or chip refill. Not sure what you're tipping for? Maybe it's the side show they put on while you try to eat?\\n\\nThe other night, the manager who acts high all the time, along with two other girl employees who acted like they were on something as well, dance and sing and whistle loudly and have inappropriate conversation that is easily audible from the dining room. All while ignoring my table which needed chip, sauce, and drink refills. They weren't even busy! Glad I left that tip in the jar! It made me want to walk up and yank it out while staring them right in the face. But I didn't...\\n\\nI suspect that this location is allowing this meth head manager to hire his meth head friends. These people are definitely on something and I'm sure the owner would know exactly who I'm talking about.. because they twitch and make awkward comments all the time!

It's making you look bad and you're losing customers every day with this type of staff.\\n\\nI won't be going to this location anymore even though the food is typically good.

He was not as apologetic as I would have expected for this type of issue; I commented that there are issues to work through as a new establishment and he commented 'no we got this one its one of our best plates'... not the best response.  They comped the entree, we paid for the drinks and apps.  \\nThe running of Food / drink  and seat / table recognition is very obvious issue as servers and managers were walking around with plates and drinks hitting a few tables before they get to the correct home.  \\nI have a pet peeve about not receiving appetizer plates when you have ordered an appetizer same goes for having to ask for silverware. The runner could not find either stocked behind the bar and ran off visibly  frustrated to find these essentials for us. \\nThe bar music choice was hip hop (not sure if thats playing in the entire restaurant)  does not suit the establishment.  \\nThe bathrooms were new and clean. The baby changing table in the ladies room was off the wall - storing it in the stall probably could be avoided. \\nI have been in their shoes, new place...working the kinks out etc. I tend to see things others may miss.

My husband is from North Carolina/Tennessee, and I have lived in Kansas City and Texas.  We enjoy all kinds of BBQ, and we are always looking for a new place to eat around the Boston area.\\n\\nWe came here last Friday night, craving some wings and ribs.  \\n\\nI can't tell you how underwhelmed we were.  But I'll try.\\n\\nThe ribs were almost burnt on the outside.  There was hardly any depth of flavor.  The red ring that properly cooked ribs are supposed to have around the bone?  Didn't exist.  When you took a bite, they were tough enough that way too much meat pulled off of the bone.  It was obvious that they were hardly trimmed before they were tossed in the smoker, if they were even trimmed at all.  I don't know what kind of smoker they use there, but I'm thinking they probably cooked those poor ribs a little too long and a little too hot.  They weren't sauced properly.  And the sauce wasn't anything to write home about.\\n\\nThe chicken wings?  Wow.  Where do we start.  We got the boneless chicken wings, at the request of my husband who wanted to be able to feed them to our one year old without worrying about bones.  I don't know where in the world these would actually pass as wings!  They looked like McDonald's chicken fingers, and they were served with equally underwhelming and totally boring mustard sauce.  They were edible and decent... but they just weren't... chicken wings.\\n\\nWe also got sweet potato fries, which even though they were just regular run of the mill sweet potato fries, were probably the best part of the meal.  They were actually what we expected, unlike the ribs or the wings.\\n\\nI do have to say that the server was very nice and attentive, and our food came out promptly.  The busser was very helpful, even offering me a plastic bag for our to-go containers (yes, we took it to go, even though it wasn't awesome.  We still paid for it!)  The restaurant was clean and not too noisy.  The high chair they gave us was clean and stable.  I do appreciate all of these things, and that's why this place gets 2 stars.  Food alone, I'd have a hard time giving it more than 1 star.  All said and done, this night out cost us $50.  It was maybe worth $15.  Bummer.\\n\\nBottom line: If you're looking for solid BBQ, make the trek to West Newton for Blue Ribbon BBQ.  It's just really not worth the price or your time.  I've had better BBQ at an Applebee's or a Cheesecake Factory.  If you're looking for a fun bar with nice TV's for a game, a few beers and a mediocre BBQ experience, this place would probably do just fine for you."},{"name":"Burrard Bridge Marine Bar & Grill","address":"1012 Beach Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Let me start with saying this place has a fantastic patio and it great for a pint.

It has all these beautiful plants and a cute portico that makes it seem like a sanctuary. It's very tranquil. \\n\\nThe Waitstaff: the waitstaff are laid back and friendly in that Austin way.\\n\\nThe Food: I have several favorite items.  I really like the roast beef tartine. It's so yummy. And, even though the sandwich doesn't seem like it is a lot of food, it actually is. Plus, the sandwich comes w/ a salad. So there's always more than enough to fill you up. Also, I usually go with a friend that likes one of the things that used to be on their menu and no longer is. But, they are always willing to make it for her. They're very sweet. \\n\\nMy other favorite item is the buffalo mozzarella, basil, and tomato salad. The mozzarella is so delicious. It has just the right amount of salt. It also comes with a delicious pesto. I don't know if they make the pesto in house or purchase it somewhere, but wherever they get it, it's phenomenal. \\n\\nThe ambiance: I mentioned the ambiance of the patio is nice, but the inside is nice too. It's very romantic. This is actually one of my favorite things about the restaurant.

I had the Cowboy Burger, because I am in love with ground cow covered in cheese, bacon, an onion ring, and BBQ sauce. Mmm. Tasty, tasty murder. I also had a pint of Sweetwater 420 to wash my burger and sweet potato fries down. SW was the clear choice, seeing as the brewery is hardly even a 9-iron away from the bar.

Host had no idea what he was doing. 4 people behind us left because they didn't want to wait for a table, which was available but not where the host wanted to place them since they were \\"swamped\\". No coke products. The appetizer came cold with no dipping sauce after waiting way too long. Asked the server three times for water. Which came while finishing dinner. The server said the lamb comes medium rare. It came well done. When telling server he asked if that was ok, my wife hesitantly said, \\"I guess so\\". So the server moved on. I asked for BBQ sauce for my steak burger and not until I was over half way done with it did they inform me there was none. Every action the server made felt awkward and like you were stupid for asking certain things. When he got something wrong like the 24$ lamb being super tuff and well done he wasn't apologetic or anything. After he came back thinking he messed up with not taking the lamb back he offered us a free dessert. We accepted. He left without letting us know what there was and after long periods of time coming back and getting what we want, then placing it, then bring it, then getting passed off from his manager to give it to us for free, then getting us our bill which had the dessert on it, then going back again for a long time to fix it. After coming back I hand him some cash. Then yet again he makes things awkward and asks if I need change. Then asks how much. Then continues to pull out a handful of coins and drops them one at a time on the table in front of me. Everything was super awkward. You think if you were paying 64$ before tip for two people that you should at least get some good food and good service. This failed horribly and you got mediocre food at a fancy restaurant price. If it weren't for the gift cards that lead me to this place in the first place I'm highly positive that I would have been super upset to the point where I would have walked out and not paid for anything after getting my wife's lamb and the server acting like he didn't want to take the lamb back and make it right.

The reservation was done online without any issues, and we received a confirmation call the day of.  Let's start off with:\\n\\nThe food- so good. For restaurant week, they had a $25 and a $35 menu. You chose an appetizer and a main course and then it was chef's selection of dessert. We ordered the fried calamari and lobster mac n cheese to start. The calamari was well cooked (not overdone like in many other places) and battered just enough. The lobster mac and cheese was on point- so creamy and awesome. It came out sizzling and good. The only critique I have is for it being called lobster mac and cheese, I would have expected there to be more and larger chunks of lobster. Onto the main course- we got the crispy beef and the stir fry tiger shrimp and scallops. Both were delicious, following suit for the appetizers. I would probably order the stir fry sans pineapple next time though. It was a touch sweet for me. For dessert, it was coconut cake and cheesecake. They were good but small notes in comparison to the previous 2 courses. \\n\\nThe drinks- I ordered a glass of the Saracco Moscato, which is one of personal favorites, and my boyfriend had the Georgia Gentleman, which had green tea rye whiskey and Aquavit. The cocktail was good but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nThe atmosphere- it's a cool interior that feels modern but not snobby. The space is a bit smaller than I thought, but they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. \\n\\nThe service- I cannot say enough how much the staff made our dining experience awesome. Our waiter Griffin was attentive, friendly, and had some really great suggestions. The host staff were courteous and prompt with our reservation. And for the cherry on top... We asked a bartender to take our picture (it was our 2 year celebration and we brought our 1 year picture to take a picture with)... And he was so excited about the picture that he actually had us restage the picture to look like last year's. \\n\\nMisc- there isn't a private parking lot or immediate street parking. There is a valet service available, but we just used a public lot a few blocks away. It was $3/5 for 12 hours. \\n\\nOverall- had a great experience and would definitely recommend if you're looking for a chill environment with good food and great service."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Finally got around to trying this place after hearing about my friends rave about it. There's usually a wait, but you can just leave your number and they will text you when the table is ready. I waited 45 minutes the first time I came, and 15 the other, both during dinner hours. \\n\\nThe ramen comes with the standard toppings like scallion, bamboo shoots, wood ear mushrooms, and of course meat. The pork wasn't meat, not just fatty like how some places serves it. I'm not a fan of their bamboo shoots though because it has a really weird taste imo. The noodles itself were really good and similar to what I had in Japan. The broth is really good as well, not too oily. My friend loved it so much that she drank all the broth before even eating much of her ramen. \\n\\nIt's +$1 for large and -$1 for a smaller size.

As a vegetarian, it's quite simply one of the best options in Orlando.\\n\\nWhat you'll find is mostly Chinese food much like you'd find at any Chinese restaurant, except all the proteins have been replaced with vegetarian options. Some of the are soy, or TVP type protein replacements, others are creative use of vegetables to replace. They even use noodles to replace shrimp. Sounds odd, but it works.\\n\\nThe food, for me, is mostly good with a couple misses. While I loved the Orange Beef, the Egg Drop soup tasted a bit odd. The dumplings we ordered as an app were perfectly cooked, crispy fried on the bottom, perfectly steamed on the top. Packed full of flavor. Most dishes will send you home with leftovers, so it's a good value for your money too.\\n\\nThe place is relatively clean, although it doesn't look like they really spent much time or effort on the interior, but that's not what this place is about. Good quality freshly cooked vegetarian Chinese food. It's delicious, the service is quick and friendly. \\n\\nThe one big drawback for me is location.

We thought the temperature issue was because the door was right next to the valet area and it was being opened frequently.\\n\\nWe had reservations for 8:30 and everyone arrived on time, but alas, we were told that they were \\"really busy and it would be 15-20 minutes\\".  When we tried to go to the bar to get a drink while we were waiting, we were completely ignored by the 4 bartenders.  They wouldn't even raise their eye gaze to make eye contact.  We gave up and asked the hostess for a glass of water.  When we finally were paged for our table, I asked the hostess if the air conditioning was broken.  She told me that they don't have a/c.  WHAT?  Atlanta in July, folks.   We were subjected to a oscillating fan which turned off several times during our meal, but luckily I had saved my menu to fan myself and others in my party.  It was so uncomfortable that a diner at another table came over and confronted us about \\"hogging the fan\\".  If patrons are getting agitated with each other because of the temperature of the room, something is seriously wrong.  Let's put it this way...the ice in my drink melted before I was able to finish it.\\n\\nThe music was so loud that we couldn't hear anything the server was saying, even when we asked him to repeat himself.  I'm not against loud music at a club, but this is a restaurant and it was impossible for us to even hear each other talk.\\n\\nWhen our salads and appetizers were served, we sat for over 5 minutes before someone else in our party had to finally ask for flatware.  Did they expect us to eat the salad with our hands?  The main entrees were served to our party of six in stages, two plates here, one plate there, and so on.  Those running the food seemed to be auctioning the plates as if they had no idea who ordered what.  Not my idea of good customer service.\\n\\nThe mixed green salad was swimming in the green goddess dressing - so much that I couldn't recognize the flavor of any of the ingredients.  It seemed to be a good salad, just way too much dressing.\\n\\nI was shocked to see my plate of three lonely bronzed scallops compared to the volume of food on everyone else's plates.  My husband got the roasted chicken, which was a generous 1/2 chicken and was very tender.\\n\\nI did notice that NONE of the entrees came with a vegetable.  This would have complimented each of the meals nicely.  Very surprising.\\n\\nI felt the total value of the meal and experience was not worth it.  I have had much better experiences at comparably priced establishments.\\n\\nThe taste of the food was very good, which is why I gave the two star rating.  However, I would never return."},{"name":"New India Buffet","address":"901 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"As far as Indian buffets go, this place makes the mark.

The restaurant is very good looking and would be appropriate for anything from a nice lunch to a date to business meeting to a bunch of guys at a bachelor party (we were the last group).  \\n\\nThe food is pretty solid.  You'll start off with some popovers in lieu of a traditional basket of bread...and you'll be glad you did.  My goodness those things were good.  Over our group we had a bunch of different food and the only thing that was slightly underwhelming was a piece of overcooked rabbit.  The \\"King\\" was a bit pricey for what you get but an impressive sight.  Everything else was priced very well and considering the atmosphere and clientele, perhaps low.

The cured olives however overpowered the tuna and the pickled beans did not provide much of a textural contrast.  \\n\\nWhile the food would have justified three stars, the service was a one.

I had a crab and lobster salad, which was not overdressed and had lovely flavor, and my dining partner enjoyed his salad (again, not overdressed). My main course was a rabbit with cauliflower puree, which I would definitely go back and eat again and again. I've had rabbit at some well-regarded Columbus restaurants where it was overcooked, or dry, or stringy, but the rabbit at De Novo was cooked perfectly, and was well complemented by the puree. My dining partner commented more than once that the steak he had was not his usual choice of cut of meat, but that it was just out of this world. They have an excellent cheese plate (hard to find), which they brought out after the meal (again, kind of hard to find restaurants that will do this in Columbus), and a nice wine and beer selection.\\nThe four stars instead of five come from decor that was a little off-putting in a few areas (murals of dead actresses), and a short post-dinner drink menu.

If you have their coupons you can order 3 subs for $12.00 (I suggest substituting vegetable \\"veggie\\" subs), they are VERY good.  LOTS of cheese, and vegetables.  \\n\\nThey deliver to the North side, or you can place a carry out order.  They have no dinning area so you can only carry our or have it delivered.

Not just ours, but the other people in the restaurant. I swear, they must have killed the animals and grew the veggies for each dish, then cooked it completely by itself. Even where people ordered the same dish, they still didn't come out at the same time.

As for the food itself, i ordered lemongrass tofu with rice... The rice was dry and bland and not good. The food itself was pretty bad. The lemongrass sauce was a sticky, sweet sauce, which is not how that should be at all. I couldn't really eat it, and it gave me a tummy ache.

They were pretty outstanding all around and after thinking about it for a while, I can honestly say that this place does everything right.\\n\\nThe menu itself isn't huge but definitely has a good, diverse selection of dishes. Want breakfast? They have you covered with delicious omelettes ($7-$8.50) which have all kinds of toppings, French toast ($7-$7.50), pancakes ($6-$6.50) and even sides like hot oatmeal and fruit salad. They also have salads, sandwiches, burritos and specialty entrees which include various Peruvian-inspired dishes which range from $8.50 to $15. They also have all kinds of drinks including natural juices - my favorite of theirs is the Surtido ($4) which has bananas, papaya, pineapple, strawberries, beets and honey - it's absolutely delicious.\\n\\nThe place isn't all that big and probably seats around 20 people at most but they do a good job at quickly serving out food - Personally, I've never had to wait and the service is some of the friendliest I've ever had.

Without me even asking, the host came over and named EVERY ITEM and gave suggestions! \\n\\nThe roof top seating is limited, but it is so cute and perfect for summer evenings! For my appetizer, I had the stuffed artichokes, which were vegetarian. Very tender and very savory. For my entree I had the mussels, which were on special for 1/2 off! The broth was rich and savory and vibrant. After I finished, I sopped every bit of it up with the focaccia it came with. It was just that good. Yum! My friend who is vegetarian had the involtini, and ate every morsel. On my way out, I grabbed a slice of the homemade key lime pie. DIVINE! SMOOTH! CREAMY! Everything was AMAZING. So fresh, so flavorful, so vibrant! Though I am seeing a bit of inconsistency when I compare my photos to other reviewers (yikes!)- out food was beautifully plated. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable!

How about 10? \\n\\nThis is certainly my favorite overall restaurant in Atlanta, and lies in the top 10 nationwide. Ambience is fantastic. Elevated ceilings with an industrial warehouse feel, floor-to-ceiling rotisserie and open wood-fire grill behind a glass wall in the center and art of interest covering the entire main wall lay the perfect scene to allude to their menu. \\n\\nDrinks. To die for. The wine barrel program (26 foot wall with 42 barrels) brought me in at first, but I couldn't look past the cocktail menu. A friend and I ordered two each, and shared them all because we couldn't decide which was best. Superb. I even ordered a mezcal... just to test them. It was the best of all.\\n\\nFood. This place isn't for picky eaters, but there are staples if you like your meat and potatoes no matter where you go. I had the duck seared with kale and andouille sausage, and was happily pleased. \\n\\nSeating. We sat outside, and if the weather permits I suggest you do too. Great views (the sun was setting so we witnessed clear blues translate into spectacular pinks and deep purples through the course of our meal) only enhance the already enjoyable outdoor area. The tables are lower and seating on couches, so this can be a bit awkward if you're having a more formal dinner, but is feasible for casual circumstances. \\n\\nI will be back here every time I visit Atlanta."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"SO after wondering around the Pru Mall, finding the elevator, and getting our IDs checked, we started the long ride up to the sky!\\n\\nOnce there, we checked our coats (free coat check is always nice), surveyed the crowd (it was quite busy, 8 on a Saturday night), and waited to be sat.. which took about 5 minutes.\\n\\nWe got to a nice little table right along the window looking out over the Hancock building and down Boylston/Newbury/Comm/etc. Obviously, the view is spectacular - and lit up at night, seeing the christmas lights down the Commonwealth mall and into the common and gardens just made it that much better. I seriously think that this time of the year made the view that much better!\\n\\nI had looked at the menu before, and chose what we would be having before, with out telling my friend with me.

You have to be comfortable, and dining often means enjoying the setting and environment, not just the food. \\n\\nBut the food.. wow... Crab Louie for App, Pan sears scallops, the most delicious tender filet, a Beet salad, then gingerbread ice cream and chocolate cake.. wow!\\n\\nThe food was rich, perfectly prepared, tasty, and had all the right size servings. It wasnt to much, but not to little. Probably more calories than I wanted.. but hey, it was a special night. I didnt think of it! ha\\n\\nAll in all, it was a great experience. I can see why some people would not agree, or have different expectations. Where I was in a suit and my friend in a cocktail dress, the couple across us was in jeans and sweaters. Were their expectations different, perhaps? were they treated differently? I hope not.. but a lot of people (from what I observed, and have read in these reviews), seem to go for the view, without a full understanding of the dining...\\n\\nIf you want to go for drinks, nice and casual, enjoy the live Jazz... do it. if you want to go for dining, do it right. make a reservation, prepare yourself, and joy and get spoiled.. the staff will help you do just that!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I am only writing out of one single visit.

We appreciate that, especially at that price point.\\nWe started with the dumplings, ham board, chicken leg, and gougeres. \\nThe ham board was great, everything else was  not. The chicken leg with beans came with beans that were terribly undercooked and hard. Yes I know beans are typically overcooked at most places, but these were too firm. \\nThe gougeres listed sweet potato as an ingredient, but it did not explain that they were stuffed with sweet potatoes. We would not have ordered them had that been listed. The mushy centers were barely warm and it was not a good mix. \\nThe dumplings were ok, but the stuffing was not very flavorful- it tasted like a frozen treat from trader joes.\\nFor entrees we had scallops, that could have used another minute of cooking, beef tartar, very good with home made chips, pork shank, another great dish. The only improvement I would suggest it not serving it with oats. Yes it was unusual, and creamy, but it left an earthy note and while mashed potatoes are not nouveaux, it would have been exceptional with this dish. The big fail came with the hangar steak. Three nuggets of something came out. Too tough to cut, flavorless and chewey. It was inedible. \\nDessert was fine, but nothing that really stood out.\\nIf you are planning a trip, stick to their charcuterie boards and crudo. This is where they shine and put the love.

I don't need 20 types of ramen if the 3 -5 options you have are badass (and they are).

They don't serve hot tea... You read that right, I've never been to a place Japanese or any other Asian theme without hot tea on the menu, really most places you don't even have to ask for it. They offer you the bottled tea like from the Japanese market, not cute.\\n\\nWhat I suggest: They need a cute hostess smiling, I'm just saying if you're going to make people wait, get the cute girl in the front to do it and nobody will be grumpy. They need faster bussing of tables, we saw 2 tables empty before we got seated, that was time we could have bailed if we hadn't really wanted to give them a chance. For the love of all that is good in the world, serve tea! It's not even that expensive if you buy a lot of it (really good quality Japanese) and just boil a lot of water. It's Brookline so people have the money to pay for tea! I almost forgot but it matters: Put a sign up and advertise!! It's in a hole in the wall \\"mall\\" that really looks like nothing from outside. If I hadn't been with a Japanese who knew it was there I'd never have heard of it.

Casual fine authentic ethnic dining without having to go west of Boundary. Saw all the good reviews of this place on Yelp and though I would try since we're only about 10 minutes away. \\n\\nHad no idea it was a part of Dineout Vancouver 2015 and went for the Dineout set menu. Went with the Dineout menu because how often have you seen this sort of menu at a Vietnamese restaurant? Adventurous types, this is certainly a welcome of traditional viet ingredients mixed with dishes you would find at fine dining establishments.\\n\\nOrdered the beef tongue banh mi bao to start and the 48-hour short rib as the main. Hint of beef tongue taste with the addition of the standard banh mi vegetables in a lightly sweetened bao was certainly refreshing. This is the sort of a beef pocket that I would find with Taiwanese food, and it was refreshing to sample the fusion of styles. Similarly, 48-hour short rib was a welcomed dish. Short rib was cooked to perfection, closer to the rare side of medium and damn was it juicy tender goodness. Coupled that with a red wine reduction and spread with a bit of the curried kabocha puree made this hearty dish feel comfortable and right for the winter season. \\n\\nMy finance went for the standard pho. Tasty broth, and noted that it wasn't heavily tainted with an over-use of fish sauce or MSG. Pretty straight forward pho, but with a tasty broth that you can tell has layers of herbs and asian spices.\\n\\nPrices very reasonable - thanks for the location.

The Fez is pretty gigantic for the South End- they have a bar area that can hold quite a few, the have a indoor dining area with a few very large tables, and the outside patio when weather permits.  \\n\\nBut the a-number-one reason to go to the Fez?  The muhammara. Oh my god, it is soooo good.  I get cravings for the stuff.  Unfortunately, the falafel leaves a little something to be desired, but it could be worse.

Like his other joints, King + Duke has the power of presence with a \\"come as you are\\" vibe which is unique to this area of Atlanta. The staff won't look down on you for wearing jeans, or shun you for only ordering water to drink. It's all about Southern hospitality. \\n\\nFor those of y'all who've been to the prime real estate at the corner of West Paces Ferry and Peachtree, you wouldn't recognize it from when the space was formerly Nava. The Southwestern earthy colors have been replaced by a cool palette of grays, blues, steel, reclaimed wood, and a massive 24-ft. hearth cooking up savory wood-fired cuisine. King + Duke's interior dining room is filled with cushy banquettes and small tables perfect for conversation and cocktails.\\n\\nThe patio at King + Duke will certainly draw a crowd. The design team constructed an awning over the majority of the deck, then swathed the archways in fabric and tinkling lights. Gentlemen, take note: you can impress a lady by bringing her here for the architectural elements alone. But the food can stand on its own.\\n\\nMy friend and I came here for lunch. We started with the aged gouda served with pickled plums (in a jam/jelly type form) and grilled bread. It was perfect for sharing, but between two people we couldn't finish all the cheese. For entrees, she had the turkey sandwich and I had the grilled cheese, followed by the phenomenal \\"Dates & Ale\\" which is a toffee bread pudding served piping hot and swimming in a Sweetwater IPA cream sauce. If it wasn't for the mug of coffee (yes, a mug, not some dainty little cup) then I would've been in a food coma going back to work. \\n\\nIn total, lunch plus tax & tip was ~$25. But it was so worth it, because like Ford's other restaurants, the service is top notch. Our server, Jess, was lovely. Our water glasses were always full, and she took the time to explain the details about the restaurant. King + Duke's name comes from \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" (re: \\"these liars warn't no kings nor dukes\\") and it's wonderful to see the restaurant keep the literary theme through several elements. For example, the cocktail list is bound in a book featuring quotes from famous writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Edith Wharton, plus the cocktails' names pay homage to Tom Sawyer and other significant fictional characters. At the end of the meal, our check was presented in a small leather case branded with the words: \\"In Memory of Pleasant Hours\\". \\n\\nFord Fry has proved that not only is he a remarkable restauranteur but also an aesthete. That's one of those words I finally get to use from my collegiate days as an English minor (who would've thought that would come in handy!) Ford's appreciation of art and beauty translated into all the aesthetic elements which truly make King + Duke a 5-star offering. Who knows? Maybe one day Ford Fry will be just as famous as Mark Twain himself."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The hype surrounding Home Slice started months before the first time I ever set foot in Austin.

Different flavor profiles from savory to spicy to sweet with the Brussels sprouts, which were my personal favorite! They had apples, pancetta, a jammy syrup...so great!

When I gave the Beacon St. location a try soon after it opened, they gave me a free pizza that had been called in to the wrong location.

Whoa.  We sat at the bar, they let us, and watched while the chef made tiny pancakes in cast iron molds, grilled my apple fritters, prepared a variety of eggs also in cast iron small skillets, then to the hot oven.  Watching was interesting and hot.  The ovens and grills and skillets are ablaze in the tiny space, and next time we will opt for a table as we are hot by nature.  By the end of the meal, the heat in there was getting to me, but think of the CHEF!!!  He is in there slaving over that area for hours and hours.  He must be used to it but I give him props all the way.  \\n\\nSo here it comes; two crispy, apple-ey fritters, not greasy but with a good butter flavor in the batter, nothing lazy here - fullness and richness of the fritter puts donuts by the same name to shame.  These were the real thing, with good body and delicate apple flavor with creme freche on the side and syrup too.  The sausage that was standard with this dish was outstanding, hubby agreed.  Fresh flavor, perfect for breakfast, no gristle.  \\n\\nHubby had the potato latke (please don't quote me, I'm not sure that's right) and it was surrounded by tiny fresh tomatoes cut in half and other lusciousness on the plate - he'll do a review under separate cover no doubt.  Coffee was great, with a little tiny pitcher of cream and the welcome silver spoon to catch up the real sugar cubes you never see anymore.  The staff is gracious and professional, friendly and knowledgeable.  They all are serious about what they are doing and you can tell.  One funny final story:  We got there early because we knew they have five stars and were popular, and so 10 minutes to 9 we were there.  There were already 2 ahead of us.  Before long, a group of 3 more joined the two ahead of us, and then another group of three more joined that same group.  The place only holds about 20 people total, so we were in dire straits for seats - hence the bar. So word of caution - GET THERE EARLY.  Or call and ask what the wait time is.  \\n\\nBroder also serves beautiful fired cocktails - watch the extraordinary wait staff make some fired off drinks carefully and with finesse.  Gorgeous.  Five stars, no holds barred.  Bravo.  I'll not only be back, I'll be back next weekend.  You can bet on it.

We were a little disappointed by the decor of the room we were brought into--it was 70's-80's tiny pictures and a wine bottle picture from like Walmart.

The first time at the ponce location it had a crowd. My party and I only seen our server 3 times the whole night.  We eventually started going to the bar for our drinks. The neighboring server whose section was next to us constantly rub her body and hands on my company making them, as well as everyone in my party feel uncomfortable to the point we just decided to leave.  The second vist seemed worst. Since I work near the location and I really enjoy their wings I decided to bring one of my coworkers who has never been there and my boyfriend.  My coworker and I walked to the location after we got off work. It was not busy at all and had no more than 4 tables with customers in the whole establishment. My coworker and I sat there for 2 minutes waiting on the server Bebee. She didn't introduce herself she just slammed the menus down and said she will be back. It took her 10 min to get back. Since I have been to Dugans before I already new what I wanted,  but my coworker needed more time.  Instead of Bebee helping my coworker find something good on the menu she took my order and walked away. She did not come back to the table until 20 mins. By that time my food was done abs my boyfriend had arrived. She finally  took my coworker 's  order and our drink order, rushing us the whole time by walking away as we were talking to her.  And we still had to wait for her to decide to come to the table 10 minutes later. When my boyfriend tried to order, she cut him off saying \\" ummm hey how are you doing? Im bebee and you just dont start saying your order you have to speak.\\" Being the gentelmen he is, he apologized and continued to order his food. By this time I am furious  and my coworker is saying how rude she is. She complains about my boyfriend not speaking when she did the same thing to us. If her name wasn't on the back of her shirt we would not have known her name. My boyfriend order wings togo with blue cheese. His food was not brought out in a to go container and she brought out ranch. We asked Bebee if there was any drink specials; she said with an attitude no. When we open the drink menu it said $3 house shots. I ordered 2 house tequilas. Eventually getting 5 altogether. We asked for the check and the drinks rung up $5 dollars a piece. When I told her that it suppose to be $3 she said with an attitude and getting loud. \\"No that ain't what you said. You asked for well tequila.\\"  I said, \\"no I didn't I asked for $3 shots of tequila, and asked her what the difference is.\\" She said, \\"the house tequilas have juice in it and you wouldn't be satisfied with that tequila.\\" Right then and there I knew she put in the wrong drinks thinking we was not going to know the difference in price. Me being a sever I know the difference between well and top shelf. I had ordered two more shots to come out with the checks and when she caught an attitude I told her we didn't want the shots and to take them back and bring us the $3 shots that we asked for. She got mad and slammed the Togo containers on the table. Seeing my face and knowing I was about to say something,  my boyfriend said we will keep the shots and he will pay for all the drinks. Being a server I know you work for your tip. And Bebee, which is the worst sever ever, didn't earn a tip. Being generous we gave her $2. And we were really contemplating about giving her that. Because of her attitude and her poor ass customer service skills we will not be back. You guys have lost out on 2 returning customers and a new customer. I was so embarrassed at the service provided to us. Bebee needs to be fired. She is disrespectful and she doesnt know her job. She put Dugans in a very bad light. If that is how you guys want your servers to treat your customers we will not be back and we will not tell no one else to go there any longer."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"You should only go here for one thing...the oysters!!

I loved the combination of edamame, yellow pepper, and gardein beef. It was interesting and delightful. \\n\\nThe meal ended with the Chocolate Budino. This was perhaps one of the most delicious deserts I've ever had. I have tried to make chia pudding before and it does not even begin to compare with the deliciousness of this item. I'm not sure what they did here, but this chia soaked in pomegranate paired with chocolate budino and toasted almonds was TO DIE FOR.

It is the oldest restaurant in the US, and it is famous because the Kennedys have eaten there.\\nSo we arrived with great expectations.  We were seated by an \\nunfriendly hostess  in the Historic Room and it was both interesting and inviting.\\nWe understood the clam chowder is highly regarded, but since I am\\nnot able to eat wheat products because of allergic reaction, I asked if the chowder is thickened with white flour.  Our waitress said yes, so we did not order it.  Frankly, I have Nova Scotia/New England heritage and authentic clam chowder is never made with white flour to thicken it.  In fact, it is made with a lot of fresh clams. They are heated in a pot until they open\\nand the meat and juice can be used. A little onion for flavor, butter and cream. Authentic clam chowder is thickened with cream, not white flour.  That is also true in New England.  Since most people not know this, and the chowder tastes good to them, so be it.\\nOn to our waitress.  This was our experience with her:\\nWhen she served my husband a bottled beer, he had to ask fora glass.\\nWhen she served the fried squid - we had to ask for two plates and lemon.  It tasted o.k., but not memorable at all.\\n\\nMy husband ordered French Onion Soup which was very good\\nin fact the best tasting item we had ordered.\\n\\nWhen she served our fish cakes, we had to ask for lemon.\\nOur entrees were their famous fish cakes with baked beans.\\nAfter a few bites of overly salted fish cakes, I determined they\\nwere filled with MSG as my tongue began to feel coated, and I \\nbegan to develop a headache and became very thirsty.\\nWhen she served the Baked Beans, we had to ask her for\\na spoon to be able to serve them on our plates.\\nThe Baked Bean - straight out of a can.\\nThe coleslaw - was good.\\nWe also order their Fish and Chips to experience it.\\nWe were served two small pieces of fried fish - little flavor\\nand some fries--both unmemorable.\\nThe Corn Bread was good. Served one piece each and\\none pat of butter.\\n\\nOur waitress became scarce and we needed more water from\\nthe reaction to the horrible fish cakes.    We had to flag\\nher down twice to get any attention.\\nNot good customer service.\\nPerhaps there are better choices on their menu, but one would thing fish and chips and fish cakes would be somewhat of their signature\\ndishes along with their clam chowder, and they would be excellent.\\nI imagine the Union Street Oyster House is riding their earlier reputation of good food and ambiance.  The ambiance is very good with all the historic decor, but their food, at least what we sampled, was \\ngood, so-so and  not good at all.\\nOur waitress was poor and needs more training.\\n\\nStill it was the Famous Union Street Oyster House, the longest\\nrunning restaurant in the US and with great decor and Kennedy\\nhistory, so it was a good to fair visit, but also somewhat disappointing; especially the food we ordered.  I imagine it is a great place to go after work, or on a Saturday and sit at the long bar, to watch sport events and eat general pub food and drink interesting beer.\\nMaybe we will give it a second try and order something beside\\nsea food and fish.

So I went with high expectations for amazing food to be surrounded by shellfish, which I'm highly allergic to, and only able to eat a side salad, basil roll, and a vegan dish that I couldn't even eat the tofu with because they fry it in the same oil as all their other food.

I also enjoyed the additions of bamboo and wood ear mushroom that came in the bowl. And though the cha-shu or fatty pork itself was more tender than previous places I've tried, it wasn't the melt-in-your-mouth level that I've been seeking. In addition, the ajitama (soft-boiled egg) I ordered as another topping was a little bit too cooked for my liking and lacked the custard-like consistency expected. However, the noodles were perfect  (firm and not too soggy) and plentiful, and I couldn't even finish the large portion (which says a lot because I can usually shovel it away when I'm famished). \\n\\nService was friendly and prompt, and I liked how the water bottle was left on table to help me drown out the massive sodium consumption.

We strive to offer all of our guests the highest quality of food, hospitality, and service while dining in beautiful surroundings.  I am truly sorry that your expectations were not met.\\n \\nThe patronage of a guest such as yourself is very important to us.  I can assure you that we take all comments, whether they are compliments or constructive criticism, very seriously and do everything possible to utilize these comments to improve on all aspects of our business.  \\n \\nOur chef decided to do a special prix fixe menu for all of last weekend due to Valentine's.

I consistently ordered my meals that wknd w sides of greens and mac & cheese to see whose I'd like best, and I think Mary Mac's took the prize. Not to mention the portion was huge! I'm not a leftovers type of gal, but best believe I had it for some late night munchies. Only downside is that I'd also read that Mary Mac's had the best peach cobbler. Maybe it's just the way I like cobblers, but I was not a fan. Like, at all. I wasn't able to try anyone else's cobbler while in Atlanta, so I don't have much to compare to in that area. Minus 1 star for parking. Until we meet again, Mary Mac."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was finally able to try this place.

Don't fall into the trap, I did."},{"name":"Townsman","address":"120 Kingston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Not worth the price tag.\\n\\nI work in the area and walk by Townsman often. Every time I pass by I notice how inviting the interior looks - great layout, open bar set-up, fun seating areas, a decently sized patio. I've been wanting to try it for some time.\\n\\nFirstly, if you're planning on making a reservation on OpenTable be aware that when you give your credit card to hold the reservation, you agree to being charged $30 per person if you cancel less than 24 hours prior to your reservation time. This wasn't a problem for us, since we had no need to cancel our reservation, but this fine print wasn't listed until after I made the reservation. That isn't even legal.\\n\\nOnwards to the dining experience. The woman who seated us was very friendly and the service was quick. Everything else was below average. The food left us unsatisfied and with a big check. We had wanted to order a few apps to share. We ordered the first two, and were considering the third while they put our first ones in. After we ate the first two apps (the seared scallops and squash pierogis) we told them we were actually just going to get the bill. The scallops were slightly cold, as was the sauce they were soaked in (even though the pan they were served in was hot), and the pierogis were mostly batter. Neither dish was horrible (we finished both) but they were not any better than something we could have made at home. We could have actually made much better scallops and pierogis at home. If these apps were 8 bucks a pop, I wouldn't have been too upset but they were $15-18! And for small portions too.\\n\\nIn terms of drinks, the wine was okay but the mixed drink I got (Summer Spritz) was disgusting. It was a mix of vodka, pineapple, a piece of watermelon, and another ingredient I'm forgetting. From the description, I was expecting a summery, fruity cocktail. I can't exactly say what ingredient it was that ruined the drink, but whatever the reason, I couldn't drink it. For a $12 cocktail, I was very upset to leave it almost untouched.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a disappointing dining experience. We ended up leaving and going to Roche Bros to pick up some hot food for dinner. Most restaurants that have crummy food but great ambiance can at the very least lend themselves to a meet up spot after work for drinks. The fact that my cocktail tasted like rubbing alcohol and a splash of pineapple juice, I won't even be coming back here for drinks.

The food, however, was very mediocre.  Our party of 4 ate in the lounge area last Saturday night.   The wait for a table was about 40 minutes as the bar/lounge area was busy.  \\n\\nThe hits:  the service was attentive and professional.  Very nice!  The decor/vibe was also attractive and sophisticated.  There were some items we got that were good - the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp but a bit over-dressed.  The warm bread they served was also really good.  The coffee was also really good!  \\n\\nThe misses: all of the other food and drinks were meh, which was surprising.  The Blood Orange Sangria sounded delicious but lacked any sort of flavor.  It tasted extremely watered down and there was no orange tarty goodness.  So sad.  Someone else in our party had Pink Grapefruit Vodka on the rocks.  That was delicious but it was not a mixed drink - it came straight out of the bottle and into the glass, so the Bancroft does not get any points for this!  Beyond the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp as mentioned above, the rest of us ordered cheeseburgers and fries, and we all shared a dessert - warm chocolate cake with ice cream.  Sadly, all misses!  The burgers were well-done, instead of medium rare as we had ordered them and they were tough (almost like they had been pre-cooked and then slapped on the grill to warm up).  The burger buns (Brioche, it said) were stale and dry, not the pillowy buttery brioche we expected, so instead of a juicy burger on a soft bun, we got tough and dry.  Poor, poor us.  ;)  We ate the burgers because we were starving by this point but we opted to send back the fries, as they arrived cold.  When we got a new batch, they were hot and crispy but over-salted so as to be inedible (and we love salt).  The warm chocolate cake and ice cream should have been a easy hit, but alas, no such luck.  The cake was bland and the ice cream was icy, not creamy, which made it taste watered down.  \\n\\nOne final complaint - the tables in the lounge have large iron bases that leave no room to put your feet, so sitting was uncomfortable.  The cushioned seating was nice but unless you had your feet up on the banquette, it was awkward to sit.

My choice was the Create Your Own Big Burger. It was a good size, flattened out(hence the name, Smashburger, I guess) maybe a third of a pound, I'm not sure. I added Swiss cheese, grilled onions and tomato with a large side of French fries. The fries were of the shoestring variety, not my favorite cut, but were tasty and without a trace of grease. As for the burger, a word of warning: It was MESSY! As soon as I picked it up it started to slide out of the bun. I managed to take a bite and immediately no longer cared about how messy it was. It was a very good burger, definitely on par with Five Guys, with a similar flavor. Wiping my mouth after every bite was a mandatory activity but so what. The bill came to about $22 with a soda. Pretty comparable to their competitors. We decided we would certainly be back the next time we find ourselves in the area.

My friend (and occasional Yelper) Tracy L and her boyfriend invited me to meet them here. I loaded my dogs in the car, and headed all the way from my Lake Creek/183 suburban enclave down to *gasp* SOUTH AUSTIN...  No biggie now, but when I was brand new in town, it was like Magellan sailing down to Tierra Del Fuego.  So when I arrived, I thought the place had a really warm, casual vibe. The waitress was very friendly and cool, and she brought me an iced tea, and some kind of rosemary/grilled cheese sandwich-y kinda thing. It was delicious! I remember it to this day!  My friends and I had a great time, and I still think about about Bouldin Creek. I guess I love it so much,  because this is the first place I visited that really said \\"Austin\\" to me. It wasn't a fast food place, or a Chili's, or some non-descript mediocre piece of generica.

They've parked a pink Cadillac behind a glass barrier at the back of the restaurant. It's like one of those ships in a bottle. How did they get it in there? Did they build the restaurant around a real, functioning Cadillac, or did they build a Cadillac replica behind that glass? And what's the glass doing there anyway? Are they really afraid that someone's going to jump into the driver's seat and take the thing for a spin? \\"Excuse me, sir? Sir? Please step out of the vehicle. This is a family restaurant.\\" \\n\\nAnyway, the food is good, but not exciting enough that I'm ever really thinking, \\"Oh boy, oh boy, I wanna go to the Cadillac!\\" Still, they serve heaping portions of great breakfast food, and I'm always delighted by the experience there. I typically go with the Albert's Eggless -- with eggs. It's basically a hash heap about chest high with the option of a couple of fried eggs on top. Glorious. My significant is partial to the French Toast, which is plenty worthy of the fame it's garnered here on yelp. Big, fat slabs of eggy, sweet toast. Don't make any big plans the day you go, because you're probably going to want to take a good, long nap after eating there.\\n\\nLunch is adequate, but, like I said, not terribly inspired. Decent mac and cheese, interesting salmon fish & chips, and a bunch of pretty boring-looking sandwiches. But you know what, those are just there for show -- the Cadillac is all about breakfast.

I was just walking by and saw it had rave reviews.  Lets just say: those reviews were very right!\\n\\nI'll start with the downside, since there was only 1.  It was kind of loud. I wasn't really there to chat, so I didn't mind.  But the area I was in was the wrong place to try and have a quiet conversation.  I arrived early and by the time I left things were in full swing and even louder.  If a guy took me here for a date I'd be pleased with his taste in food, but annoyed that I'd probably have to yell our conversation for the evening. \\n\\nNow the positives.  The food was fantastic!!  I had the scallops, which were by far the best scallops I have had in my life.  They were large, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and sitting on top of a bed of spinach and potatoes.  But that's not all, there was some kind of delicious sauce that was a perfect compliment. \\n\\nUsually when I get scallops at at restaurant I feel kind of cheated.  Tiny scallops, I'm still hungry, and my god did I just pay that much for this tiny plate?  Nope, that didn't happen here.  The price and quality were both excellent. \\n\\nDessert was fried ice cream (ice cream covered in quinoa and peanuts) with figs and a goat Chantilly cream.  It sounded a little odd on the menu, but my waiter recommended it.  \\n\\nIt. was. AMAZING.   \\n\\nThe tangy cream, the sweet (but not too sweet) figs, the decadent ice cream and the crunchy, nutty quinoa/peanuts all worked together like some flavor-tastic symphony of amazingness. \\n\\nI'm picky.  I've worked as a pastry chef.  I have friends who are chefs.  This place was good.  AND it had a menu for people who are gluten free or vegan.  Love that they can accommodate that. \\n\\nWill be visiting this place again!"},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"I joined 10 of my colleagues here to celebrate the last day of school!

They serve many of the cocktail classics and some very unique additions, like lavender and eggs (go see for yourself)!  Even the bar items are locally sourced and seasonal too, it doesn't get much better that that!

Five stars for novelty. Three stars for actual taste. Three stars for price.\\n\\nBlueberry, bubblegum (with bubblegum in wax paper attached), voodoo doll, raspberry filled, Portland creme, plain sugar, tang orange dipped and dusted. Total cost for seven doughnuts? Over $15 dollars. Not to say that's expensive but in comparison to every other doughnut shop from boring to boutique, that's on the high end of price spectrum.\\n\\nEnjoyed these in the morning with a tall dark coffee with an extra espresso shot. The voodoo was great for novelty, raspberry for blood, the pretzel stick for a dagger through the heart. But the problem is the novelty wears off and you have to actually eat the doughnut sponge bread. That was the problem. Of course, the plain glazed classic is the defacto basic comparison, where the breading is evaluated. It tastes like it should but is dry and waxy, and the texture is like wonder bread that has gone stale. This is where a standard glazed from Krispy Kreme rules over all other doughnuts and the reason it does. \\n\\nThe best of the bunch was the blueberry, which had a crunchy sugar glazed exterior (like an old fashioned) and a gooey soft interior with blueberries - it looked totally different than the rest of the doughnuts breading. The second best was the Portland creme which is chocolate coated, custard filled, with 2 dots of white frosting. The orange tang with 3 marshmallows on top and gum flavored glazed were strictly novelty and were not eaten after the first tasting bite. The plain glazed was awful and worse in every way than your generic 35 cent local grocery store offering.\\n\\nCASH ONLY at their shop, keep that in mind. Loud boombox makes it hard to order food but is quite fitting to the eclectic interior, doughnut selection and staff.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the novelty and experience and effort to make doughnuts appealing through novelty earns Voodoo Doughnuts a must-see while in Portland. \\n\\n3/5 stars: A-OK!"},{"name":"Magic Wok Restaurant","address":"6700 Conroy Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Fabulous fresh Chinese food - which is nearly impossible to find in ORLANDO!

Let me start by saying initially I thought the new ownership under Adam Owen was going to be great. They created what seemed to be a deal that was best in town (depending on where you live) with rounds of golf and range time included in the fee and the fee is reasonable. Man was I wrong, not only did the course take a beating but they are also very greedy as their spacing is terrible (try to get to many players out at once). Rounds went from 4.5 hours to 5.5-6 hours so fee reasonable yes but worth it no. furthermore to make up for the reasonable fee they increased beverage and food costs and the service diminished because of the sheer volume of players. I actually continued to pay may monthly fee and continued to dump money in. Then when it came time to cancel because my work schedule picked up and I did not play there for 6-7 months \\"They could never get my written notice\\". I finally got them to accept my email as the written notices were not working and they still continue to charge me.

Our CC company has sent us an updated list of our clients that are being billed and you are not on the list so I have no explanation\\" - Adam Owen (Good ownership).

Being an event planner, I'm always looking for unique places to refer clients.  ‚ÄãWriting this review as I stand here waiting for them to get to our reservation which was at 10pm‚ÄãÔøΩ? It is currently 1043pm. The check-in process...wait, what check-in process. This is a joke. 6 people are standing at the hostess desk...for what? Waiters are bringing food in between us on the wall and the desk. Do you know how many people are breathing and coughing over this food...let alone all the ‚Äãpeople they are pushing themselves through.

The complimentary valet was a good bonus. \\n\\nOh wait....it's an hour later and they just called us. I'll finish this later.\\n\\nOk....still unimpressed. Although I love the decor, everything else is sub-par. They sat us a small table (although there were empty booths, they were kept for larger parties. Ok, that's fine). Why is my chair wobbly though? This place shouldn't have wobbly chairs.  Not a huge selection of entrees, but that's not a problem. I don't eat pork or beef, but there was 1 chicken selection, and I believe 3 seafood selections. We went with the scallops and the mahi mahi. My food came out cold. Like, really cold--the bottom of the plate wasn't even warm. The sauce on my fish was even cold....but my fries were warm. I hate sending food back, but after waiting to get seated and waiting to order, I was hungry. I crossed my fingers. They didn't give me any fuss about sending it back. I thought they would probably microwave it, but they actually brought out a new plate...and it was hot. Big difference. The fish was pretty good. I would have preferred a vegetable over fries, but that's just personal preference. The only other thing I was disappointed in was the glasses they brought my drinks out in. We ordered red wine and prosecco. They were brought out in these small cocktail glasses. Huh? Did they run out? I tried to entertain in, but I just couldn't. I asked the waitress for real glasses and she questioned me like I wasn't sure, but she end up bringing them out and pouring them in the new glasses. \\nThis place has the potential to be great. It just needs some some help here and there. Not sure if any of these things are the reason they were shut down before...but I think if they revamp it, it would be a great place to go more than once. I don't think I would be returning anytime soon. Too many places in Atlanta that have better service.

And you'd promptly lay down your credit card, like it was totally cool that you'd just wasted that much money on food AND drinks you coulda made yourself from better ingredients, better liquor, at half the price? Well, that's how I feel when I think about dinner at La Hacienda Real.\\nHubsy and I met another couple for dinner here on a Saturday in June, at 7:30 PM. The dining areas that I could see were MAYBE half full, which was surprising to me, when it's a weekend in the suburbs and this place used to be a Chilis. It didn't really bother me - just like it better when the atmosphere has a buzz. \\nWe ordered beers at $4-5 each (Corona Lights) and our friends had a margarita and sangria. The menu had so many items, it was really hard to decide what to order. Having earlier in the day been to a kiddie birthday party where we shoved our faces full of so much sugar, WE needed a timeout, hubsy & I decided to share a plate. Our friends ordered separate things. Our friends had a buy one get one free entrees coupon, and one for us as well, but since we were stuffed, we decided that we'd order one of the \\"big\\" plates on the back of the menu, w/o a price indicated.\\nI'm not super picky when it comes to Mexican food, and when the plate arrived, everything on it was good enough. Nothing to write home about. It should be noted - as many others have also done - that the bean stuff they bring with the warm chips is SUPER delish. And it's a nice touch, beyond just salsa. Our friends devoured their meals, and so did we, and while no one had any complaints on their run-of-the-mill Mexican food, I couldn't help but remember the far more superior Mexican food we rather often make for ourselves and our friends at home. Slow cooked steak/chicken, all the fixins, fresh tortillas... margaritas made from fresh juice and good tequila... all for waaaay less.\\nWhen the bill arrived, although we hadn't had the cocktails, and we had shared a plate, our tab was so much higher, because as it turned out, the one giant plate cost $22, which it wasn't worth. In combination with the half-empty restaurant, kinda slow service, and the chips liner paper that was left from the Chillis days (why this bothers me, who knows)... meh. The whole thing made me wish we had saved our money. Not just that night, but like 10 years ago when we'd constantly roll to every stupid, mediocre restaurant, and spend like we didn't have kids and a mortgage. Cuz we didn't.

I will have to say that the atmosphere is what makes this place, not the food or the service. Upon seating, we were introduced by 2 servers at 2 separate times. The first server got our drink order, and the second server then came asked for our drink order. While the second server was at the table, he asked if we had any questions. I did. I asked about the tuna entre. I wanted to know if it was served rare. He said it was, and the chef recommended medium rare. The first server came back to take our food order. Then, the second server came to take our food order. Really? This is confusing and annoying. We ordered the artichoke to start as our appetizer. I ordered the tuna for my entree, and my husband ordered the flat iron steak medium rare. The artichoke was fine; it was served with an interesting aioli. However, I will have to say Houston's artichoke is hard to beat, and this artichoke was lacking salt and flavor. When the entrees arrived, my husband was delighted that his steak was cooked perfectly, and instead of green beans, he ordered extra mushrooms. He was thrilled with his dish. Unfortunately, my tuna was cooked well done. I explained to the server that took our order that didn't answer our questions, that the tuna was well done. He asked if I specifically asked for medium rare. Um, did you ask?...was what I was thinking.  I did not because I was not asked how I wanted it cooked when I ordered. I assumed that it would be served the way the chef recommends. I asked for it to be replaced with ahi tuna starter. At this point, we were finished with our drinks, and we were never asked for another round. I had to flag down the server to get a second glass of wine. My ahi tuna finally arrived, and my husband was finished eating his dinner.  I was almost finished with my ahi when my second glass of wine finally came to the table. I will have to say the ahi tuna is more of a cold ramen dish and shy on the tuna. Not impressed at all.

Anyone familiar with Indian food would find most of the offerings familiar - naan and chicken with sauce with tikka massala, chicken cooked to a bright red color, and plenty of offerings featuring flavored rice, cauliflower, chick peas, eggplant and potatoes.  And the familiar bright yellow of turmeric.   After the amazing soup, everything was kind of blur - I liked it all a lot, but couldn't wait to get more soup.  Nothing was really extremely seasoned, and the buffet format allows lots of experimenting.  Be absolutely sure to let the cashier know if this is your first visit - they have some great discounts waiting for you to use on your next visit.  My recommendation?

No refill offered on hot green tea. She was busy listening to her earbuds, folding silverware and facing the wall, so we had to ask the hostess, the bus boy , then the MGR to please produce a side plate of noodles. When she finally got around to us with a check and a to go container. She plopped the empty on the table and walked away. One of her earbuds had just fallen out of her head scarf, so she had priorities. The ramen bowl is much wider than the container so it takes some skill to pour it into a to go cup. 90% chance that you will spill some on the table. Why not just do it for us? So easy if it is your job. The noodles themselves were undercooked. Both times. You now only get half of a boiled egg , not a whole.

Never at a restaurant have I been challenged like this, any restaurant manager worth his salt would have just immediately said I'm sorry and gotten a damn order of fries...I tell him again we ordered this and I'll be glad to pay him direct but I refuse to stand in line again and the girls with us are hungry!  He leaves.  He brings back the fries.  He returns again, only this time he brings the receipt and says I just wanted to show you the receipt that doesn't have any fries on it...this guy is clearly in over his head at his job...I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FREAKING TICKET DUDE! Your order taker screwed up, make me happy! WTF? He obviously doesn't care if people never come back to his restaurant does he?\\n\\nSo on to the food.  Drivel and slop. The burgers only come in medium and well done which in my opinion is a travesty to destroy angus meat so completely...they might as well use the worst grade beef available. I reluctantly selected medium. The burger came more than well done, it was worthless in taste. Toppings were decent enough. Burger was small and sloppily put together, I've seen Big Macs on the side of the road in a prettier state. The fries (after fighting to get them) were actually good. The sweet potato chips were stale. The shake was nice and thick but the coffee taste and alcohol combo just ruined it.  I shoulda went with the banana cream one but now I'll never know because this is one place permanently scratched off my ATL foodie list.\\n\\n$36 for two tiny burgers that left us hungry, a beer, a shake, and chips (no fries!)...I absolutely made sure all my friends who like to eat out knew about this experience as well."},{"name":"It's Italian Cucina","address":"1500 South Lamar Blvd, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Didn't start here, but glad we ended up here!

The hostess was another story.  We went in to put our name on the list.  The hostess said we'd have a two hour wait.  I saw a few open tables and assumed that she was sandbagging to discourage people, something that isn't too uncommon at very popular places.  The restaurant was moderately busy so I figured the tables were just in the process of being cleaned and folks would be seated shortly.  In any event, I suspected our wait would be far shorter than two hours.  We took our spot outside and waited only about fifteen minutes for a table.  During that time I saw several other folks drive up and run in and then out of the restaurant to drive away.  I can only imagine they were told the same thing, a two hour wait.

The smell and flavor are bright, with just the right amount of coconut milk, sour lime, spicy peppers, exotic galangal and lemongrass.  Watch out, some of the aromatics are still in the soup, biting down on a piece of woody galangal would be terrible.\\n\\nPad Thai with chicken - Very good with a nice amount of sauce and lovely crunch from the bean sprounts and shredded carrot.  The noodles are firm but chewy and the chicken is perfectly seasoned.  I think a Thai restaurant that can't make a good pad thai should be avoided.\\n\\nThe spring rolls - they are my son's favorite.  I'm not a big fan, but they are better than what I've eaten at other places in Portland.  \\n\\nChicken Satay - the chicken is yellowish in color, like it was marinated in curry prior to being grilled, these are so so good and the peanut dip they come with is bowl licking tasty.  Sadly, they hardly ever have these, so call ahead if you are planning to come in for these.\\n\\nKee Mao - I liked this but one one else did, the sauce had a slightly sweet flavor and my guys were not fans.  The wide noodles were too alien to them and so I ate it over the course of two days lunches, delightful leftovers.\\n\\nCashew dish with Chicken - My husband liked this, but I didn't.
