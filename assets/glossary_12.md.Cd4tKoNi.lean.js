The wait time without a reservation is a minimum of 20 minutes, and you'll have to wait outside because the cafe is very small and cramped. Even with a reservation, I've often ended up waiting for 10 minutes until a table opens up. \\n\\nThe cafe is very small and cozy. Tables are right next to each other and they'll often move tables so that people can squeeze into the inside chairs. Avoid coming here with large groups. Seating is limited so it's best to come with one other person. There's not much privacy so you can often hear the conversation at the next table, though the entire cafe is pretty loud. There are also crayons so you can decorate the table cover to pass the time. \\n\\nThe service is extremely friendly! You can always ask the staff about ingredient substitutions or additions. However, the chef in the kitchen won't always allow it (unless it's a dietary restriction). I also found issue with the cleanliness of this cafe after finding a hair in the home fries with jalapeno cheese sauce. After I pointed it out to the wait staff, I got an apology and they quickly took the plate away. However, they did not replace the dish or offer a refund for it.  I expected better service because it took away my companion and my appetite that day and from then on, we scrutinize our plates before we dig in. \\n\\nThe food here is DELICIOUS. I have yet to find a better brunch and I often insist on splitting 3 entrees between two people. I always order the home fries with jalapeno cheese sauce. It contrasts greatly with all the sweet items on the menu. I highly recommend the Lobster Eggs Benedict or their Steak and Lobster BLT Benedict. Both are equally delicious and I always make sure either my companion or I order it. The Fresh Berry Stuffed French Toast is very sweet and will satisfy any sweet tooth. I've also tried the Lobster & Avocado Omelet but I much prefer the Benedict. \\n\\nMake a reservation if you're coming in for weekend brunch, be prepared to be close to utter strangers as you dig into the most amazing brunch ever (but make sure to check your food before you dig in!), and order the Lobster Eggs Benedict!"},{"name":"Crepes a La Cart","address":"2018 Broadway St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is phenomenal - if the service was faster, I would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately when they're crowded  it takes a long time to get your food, so;...4 stars.\\n\\nI discovered this place a few weeks ago and have been back 3 times.

The pasta was $8.95 which was a good deal for the portion. I liked the meatballs and the buffalo mozz salad was perfect (such a shame though- that so many innocent buffalo's had to die). The angry bf's only complaint was that they used a bit too much oregano on the bread, pasta and (meat) balls  and though it kills me to agree with his critical antics: He's right.

I went there daily for months, and it seemed like they did not even recognize me.  The owner, Neil, is nice though.  The atmosphere at Brewin is strange.  It seems like you are in a closet.  The chairs are very flimsy.  The tables are too small, but that is only because of the limited space.  Whenever I sit down, I feel like I am being rushed out.  They make it obvious that they do not want you to eat there.\\nI do like the social aspect of Brewin.  There are always kids there, so I can almost assume that I'll see someone I know.\\nThe only reason why I still stop by from time to time is their breakfast sandwiches.  They are very cheap and delicious.  I recommend the Egg, Pepper, and Provolone on an Everything Bagel.  It is fantastic.

It was slightly more expensive than some other sushi/asian buffets in the area, but WELL worth it. \\n\\nI will say that once the place filled up a bit, the area around the buffet got a bit crowded but I think it was just a bit of an opening rush.  I would definitely reccomend this place but as an experienced tip - get there just before opening for dinner to really give you the prime experience."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Yummy sandwiches and soups but it took forever to get our check.

Simple, there is always something to get at one besides coffee.\\n\\nI came here for the first time a couple of months ago with Leighann and Daniel M. I liked it immediately. It had a homey look. It looked upper-class without making me feel under-dressed.  It is a little less expensive than Starbucks, but without that cold corporate feel most chains have. In fact it wasn't until I came across another 2 locations that I realized it was a chain at all.\\n\\nWhile I am not an overly-decisive person, I love having a lot of choices. And this place offers a lot of choices.  First off - they have 23 kinds of coffee.. Hello!! But wait, I don't like coffee.  Can i get something to drink?\\n\\nYES!!! Want some tea? Sure we have over 12 varieties. Or would you like some hot cider?  Maybe a hot chocolate. Wanna give your hot chocolate a kick? try one of the flavor shots. Choose from     \\n    * Chocolate Raspberry\\n    * Cinnamon\\n    * Cinnamon Hazelnut\\n    * Coconut Creme\\n    * Creme Brulee\\n    * French Vanilla\\n    * Hazelnut\\n    * Pumpkin Pie\\n    * Swiss Chocolate Almond\\n\\nHmm.... a little famished? Try something to nibble on with that. We have choices of all kinds of pastries ranging from cannoli to fruit tarts, and don't forget MUFFIN TOPS!!!! But if you need something a little more filling, they have a few paninis to check out as well.\\n\\nSo, while you may not favor reviews that are from non-coffee drinkers, I know I sure enjoyed this place.

I scooped some rice and then some chigae - soooo good.  It was pretty close to my favorite place back home and that made me happy.  We quickly devoured our portions and were content.

Imagine the most velvety and buttery oyster entering your mouth. Clean. Sweet. Savory. Yes, my friends, this is the Island Creek Oyster and it is superior to any oyster you'll find in the west coast. \\n\\nThe Island Creek Oyster was bigger in size compared to the Shigoku, Misty Point, and Rocky Nook oysters we tasted, which were decent, but still paled in comparison. With an ultrasweet finish, I've concluded that these oysters thrive in cold water. The taste of an oyster is affected by temperature and its environment.\\n\\nThe other dishes we tried were solid minus the clam chowder which was a bit on the salty side, but still tasty thanks to the clam juice and chunks of clam distributed throughout the chowder. The lobster roe pasta was another favorite - the noodles were cooked al dente, the dish had a generous amount of lobster and the flavors were satisfying enough for me to wish I had the dish all to myself. The cold lobster roll was also packed with lobster, but it was slightly heavy on mayo and I normally prefer my lobster rolls hot.\\n\\nIf I lived in Boston, I would come here for some ME time during happy hour and enjoy a dozen Island Creek Oysters all to myself while contemplating my place in this world. After all, the world is your oyster. So eat a lot of oysters in this life time, and make sure they're Island Creek Oysters.\\n\\n4 stars for the restaurant, 5 stars for the oysters."},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Really nice coffee shop.

I was dubious, since I have not been impressed with other Emory Point restaurants for food value for $$, but I ordered the lasagna, upgraded w/side Greek salad, coffee (requested lots of cream), & water w/lemon.  My dad ordered the Chicken gyro sandwich, upgraded w/Greek salad as his side.  There is a $2 upgrade charge for both.  Although I pointed out to the waitress afterward that she should have flagged the upcharge (you could have figured there would be one, by looking at the menu...but I hadn't realized), I would have definitely paid anyway & they were worth it. Have to say, I was very pleased. The \\"side\\" salads were pretty big for a side, and for the first time in awhile a side Greek salad actually had a good bit of Feta cheese in it!  And not too much dressing!  And we got automatically some excellent garlic bread...toasted w/parmesan cheese.  Got extra for n/c, & it was so good. The waitress was very helpful & conscientious. She brought me my coffee with 2 little creamer \\"pots\\" to start, which is not always the case in my experience, even when I warn servers I want \\"lots\\" of milk/cream.  Coffee was fresh (I can tell if it's been sitting more than 10 minutes or so) & decent...she came  by multiple times to give me the refills I wanted (needed, really!).  My dad & I both enjoyed the good-sized side salad & bread, and although he ate his whole gyro there (which looked a good size) and said he really liked it, I was only able to eat a small portion of my lasagna, since I was pretty full.  When I left & needed \\"to go\\" options, the waitress was very nice about my request for not only boxes but also aluminum foil to line the lasagna Styrofoam box. Now, I always get lasagna at a new Italian restaurant, it is my \\"test\\", since I love lasagna. It has to be better than what I can get from Stouffers! And at least as good as I can make myself. It passed w/flying colors! plenty of meat, a nice \\"bright\\" tomato sauce, decent amount of cheese (I like a bit more ricotta, but this was fine), decent portion size.  Not over-salted, either (I expect the gyro was also not over-salted, since my dad added salt...he likes things very salty.  I don't.)Now, I understand that the lunch menu during the week has the same thing for less $ (E.g. I paid $15 plus $2 for Greek instead of  house salad for the lasagna meal), but I was quite satisfied.  Only 4 stars since I haven't yet tasted the tiramisu I took to go (looks okay but...we'll see) and I haven't tried any of their other pasta dishes, which I was told are made w/fresh, home-made pasta.

I don't appreciate poorly trained staff acting as if they're doing patrons a favor when they're straightening out in-house problems that really have nothing to do with us. \\n\\nOur waiter was average and went through the motions of doing an adequate job.

You could also just veg it up with some of their yummy sides, as well done concoctions like the hush puppies and collard greens take me back to the delights of granny's kitchen.

I was in town for LASIK eye surgery and needless to say I needed a very chill place o recover.  \\nThe JW Marriott staff went so far out of their way to assist me. The rooms were able to pitch dark even in the bright of day. True to Orlando form, this hotel is awesum for kids with activities, pools  and a lazy river.  But its stellar for adults with a sprawling weight room which includes a Smith machine if you're serious about training, and on property Starbucks, Primo, a full service Italian restaurant for an excellent dining experience, large rooms and close proximity to the airport, downtown Orlando, Kissimmee, St Cloud and Universal City Walk.  Its true that you can come to Orlando and have a terrific experience without ever stepping foot in the parks.  \\nEvery hotel experience depends on what you wanna get out of it.  What I needed was a quiet, chill place to recover from a complicated surgery and for me the JW Marriott of Orlando was the perfect place. Its a sprawling, quiet, calming refuge with all the amenities you'd need in order to never have to leave the hotel property.  Kudos to a very helpful staff. \\n\\n- Arik Katzenberg"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had heard about Pok Pok from (is this shameful to admit?) the Food Network's show, \\"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\\"  I'm sorry, I like that show.  It amuses me.  And if it showcases something in Northern Oregon, it gives me great ideas.\\n\\nSo we went there.  Aware that the seating area is small and there could be a wait, I wanted to go on a weekday.  We still hit it right at dinner hour.  Parking is all street-side, and we had to park about a block down.  I was concerned because the signs fluctuate between 1 hour parking, 1/2 hour parking, no parking, and nothing at all.   I didn't get a ticket, so I guess I figured it out alright.\\n\\nThe seating area really -is- small, but we were seated right away.  Unfortunately, we were seated right next to their short, five-stool bar.  Because of this \\"cozy\\" seating arrangement, the bar stools were maybe five inches away from our table.   It wouldn't have been too bad, to start, when no one was sitting at the bar next to us, but about twenty minutes after our arrival, a man and a woman arrived, obviously on a date, and chose to sit at the bar right next to us.\\n\\nSo I am in a seat at normal seat height.  A young, fairly attractive woman is sitting on a bar stool, where her arse was right at my eye level.  \\n\\nHonestly, do you know how hard it is to have a nice dinner with your wife in a good restaurant and not awkwardly stare at her, when you have a stranger's butt less than half a foot away from your face?  It was rather strange, I'll admit.\\n\\n...if you're interested, she was wearing black tights and had a pink thong.  I know this because I do.\\n\\nAnyways, scenery aside, the experience was incredibly enjoyably.  I highly suggest drinking the water provided on the table.  The pandanus leaf they flavour the water with is absolutely delicious.  We drank two carafes of that on top of our ordered drinks. \\n\\nWhich, incidentally, were drinking vinegars.  I had strawberry and the wife had passion fruit.  We absolutely loved them.  They were crisp and tart, not sweet at all, but not sour.  I was definitely outside of my comfort zone as I tried these.  I wanted more immediately after drinking mine.\\n\\nAs for food, Pok Pok sort of specializes in street food done right.  It's smaller portion sizes of which you should order several.  They recommend three dishes for two people, but the urge to experiment and experience different things is great.  We tried four dishes and found two of them amazing, one good, and one a good thing to try but nothing we'd order again.\\n\\nMy wife's favorite was Kung Op Wun Sen, which came in a clay pot to the table.  It was four very large prawns (which had to be de-legged, de-eyed, and de-skinned, be forewarned.  But definitely not pre-packaged, frozen, reconstituted prawns) in the pot with some small pieces of pork belly for flavour, noodles, and a bunch of spices and what-not.  I literally thought she was going to moan for an hour as she ate it; to her it was heaven.  She rarely uses the word \\"delicious\\" when talking about food...that's her highest compliment ever.  She said it at least four times, to four different staff members that came by our table.    I did not eat this, as I do not like seafood.\\n\\nSo we also got Muu Paa Kham Waam, which is boar collar, rubbed with ginger and garlic and things like that, and then glazed, brought out with some amazingly beautiful mustard greens, all iced down with great chunks of ice (the presentation was fabulous!) and some sauces.  We ate this with sticky rice and it was wonderful!  Spicy, great texture, and very, very delectable with a bite of mustard greens right after the hot, spicy boar.   Definitely something we would order again.\\n\\nMy \\"safe\\" dish was Sii Khrong Muu Yaang.  It was basically a huge plate full of short ribs, with a hard glaze over them.  These were very lean ribs that, on first bite, were rather pedestrian.  Then I tried the dipping sauces they came with and I loved it.  The sauces absolutely made the whole thing.    The portion for this was very large, and I ended up taking over half of the ribs home, since I couldn't eat all of them.\\n\\nOur last dish was an experiment, which was the Yam Wun Sen.  This was a \\"salad\\" that was mostly noodles, with some house-made pork sausage, and a lot of different types of vegetables.   It was very sour and tart, which I understand is the point, but we found it a bit off.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't to either of our tastes.  And with the boar collar being shared equally by us (i.e. whoever got to it first, won), her with her prawns, and I with my sauce-dipped ribs, we had more than enough.\\n\\nDesert was wonderful, a coconut ice-cream and a custard on salty-rice, and the bill was...reasonable for what we got in the location that it was in.\\n\\nMy wife was already making plans on coming back before we even left.   Absolutely a keeper!"},{"name":"Pepper Lunch","address":"5951 No 3 Road, Unit 150","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"I found the food here to be pretty mediocre.

So, here I am.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:  Whether your goal is to hunker down and study or people watch, this place has the right seating and views for you. BCCC offers big, comfy, leather couches mixed in with hightop tables and chairs as well as tables looking right out into the street.\\n\\nThough there have been a few times where I've come here to work and found my ears inundated with loud chit-chatters, most of the regulars here are pretty respectful of their own noise levels. The music isn't half bad either. Sure, there are some nights when Alanis Morissette and Dave Matthews are played (on repeat) but for the most part, you'll hear Elliott Smith, Radiohead (very often played), Passion Pit, and Spoon.  \\n\\nWhat impresses me about this place is that they're not trying all that hard to be anything other than a nice little coffee shop. They're not hip nor are they trying to be. A college student belongs here just as much as her grandparents.\\n\\nCOFFEE:  Truth be told, the coffee isn't mind blowing but it's not mind-numbing either. If you're from out of town (or perhaps a Bostonian who doesn't live in the downtown area), you don't need to come to try this stuff. \\n\\nIf you are a downtowner and need a break from corporate chains, give this place a shot. I'd recommend the latte (better than the drip which is inconsistent in quality) or the ice coffee (which has never been bad). If you need suggestions, the staff is quite knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions.\\n\\nFOOD:  I've never had anything I haven't liked. If you can't decide, the pressed panini's are the thing to get. The eggplant pressed panini (Salam Panini) is solid. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. I would recommend that the dressing for the mix green salad side be put on the side. (They smothered my salad with dressing.) The three-bean side salad isn't bad either. \\n\\nSERVICE:  Excellent!! The baristas here are reliably friendly, knowledgeable, and good at their job. I couldn't ask for more.\\n\\nOVERALL:  In any other part of town (say, Cambridge), this place would be a solid 3 stars.

Once I got my pizza they forgot the sauces(I prefer mine with sauce so I had to wait 20 min for the driver to come back to eat my pizza) mistakes happen but this is not the first time. Now on to the pizza... The toppings on the ham pepperoni half were eh okish but for 5$ please get the ham on the whole half not just tossed in the middle. My $3 feta was basically non existent not only could you barely taste it but there were no chunks it was like the dust at the bottom of the jar of feta. And also only on mostly the two middle pieces.as for the crust it was horribly soggy till mid slice and had to be sliced off to eat it without dripping. 2 stars cause the guy did go back and get my sauces but then again I did pay for them. I will be getting pizza elsewhere for the 30$ i paid this pizza should have been epic. I got the same thing from pizza extreme on I drive for $20.00 including all toppings and it was the best pizza I ever had."},{"name":"Sushi Sakura","address":"506 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Mmm...kaiten sushi.

This review is for you. We were greeted immediately by a sever offering to seat us. We asked to see a menu to find out if this place is was what we were looking for first. As soon as we got the menu, the manager came barrelling out from the kitchen and asked to seat us. We explained again we wanted to look at the menu first. Honestly, we were feeling the place out because there were several other restaurants nearby that also looked interesting. Ultimately, it smelled good and we were hungry so we asked to be seated. We tried to sit at a table in the corner but were shuffled to a higher traffic table in the middle of the dining area. The ambiance is bland and sterile for an Italian restaurant. Nothing warm or romantic about it. By the way, we realized we couldn't sit at the table we wanted to because the servers were going to roll silverware at it, right beside us. Ok. Next, the waiter brought over the menus and on his journey to us, promptly dropped them onto the floor, directly next to the garbage can, no less, picked them up and put them on our table. Is it too much to ask for good health practices in restaurants? Menus are laminated, and they should've been cleaned. Server should've washed his hands. Server takes our drink order. We asked to start with waters with lemons and server returned to tell us that he is not allowed to give lemons with the waters because the lemons are for the kitchen only. Ok. We tell server we need more time and he literally does not come back for 20 minutes. Didn't need that long... Next we order directly from the menu and the first thing we order, server tells us, \\"we don't sell the ravioli here\\". Mind you, I'm pointing to the item on the menu, \\"you mean you no longer sell it?\\" I inquire. Very confusing. We finish ordering and the calamari comes out first. Well-carmelized and tasty. I could take or leave the sauce that comes with it. Mostly leave it. Manager asks us how the appetizer is and we complement it. We ask if he is of a specific ethnicity (one that is known to be very good at seafood and calamari preparation, mind you) and he rolls his eyes and let's us know that he's Italian, and obviously offended. Let me take this opportunity to tell you that every instance of the owners\` presence was overwhelming and obnoxious. I witnessed both of the owners micromanage their staff, overdo the interaction with guests, and generally just make the vibe awkward. During the brief visit, we heard the life story of every staff member in there because they speak loudly out in the public space and there is no music to drowned it out. I'm all about a family atmosphere, but it just seemed that the timing and appropriateness of the staff was off. A guest dropped silverware and none of the staff got up from the nearby table they were occupying, as they chatted, to pick it up and replace it. We got our own drink refills a few times because staff was noticeably either oppressively nearby or nonexistent.. Now that the tone is accurately set for you, the food arrives... The delicious: the pasta, which the server says was homemade, the foccacia bread, polenta, the mushroom marinara sauce, the lemon torte... the good: most of the meatballs were good including the lamb and the traditional, the cannolis... The ok: the buffalo meatball, and the spicy pork meatball, the salad, the super smash sandwich, the pizza appetizer... The bad: none of the food was truly bad (hence 2 stars) but the lack of sanitary practices, poor service, and ambiance could ruin this place. My suggestion: get the owners off the floor, don't be presumptuous with customers--most just want to eat and enjoy their own family, not hear about the server's back problems, sorry.  Also, take a National Restaurant Association course or two, and get rid of the sterile diner feel... or better yet, just order take-out and decide what you think for yourself!"},{"name":"Wings Over Somerville","address":"519 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"So, I'm going to be one of those people who signs up just to write a review because of bad quality.\\n\\nWe just ordered a Skymaster, half cajun blackend and half honey mustard.

Moonshine beat out Ranch 616 and Koriente from the menu and yelp reviews. Plus I hoped we might run into Jenna Bush, or even better the young Barbara. She just does it for me, I dunno why. \\nI heard they hang out there when in town. \\n\\nAnyways, we arrived early on a Saturday night just before the crowds hit. Our waitress whole heartily recommended the Molasses & Chile Cured Pork Chop with Bourbon Apple Sauce ($17.95).  I was headed toward the Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Charred Pineapple and Green Chile Salsa($14.95) But her recommendation seemed so genuine I changed my mind.  \\n\\nAfter-wards, I heard her make the same recommendation verbatim to about 10 other tables.  Not that I should get an exclusive recommendation or anything, it is just it seemed a little practiced after I heard it 10 times. \\n\\nLulu (my wife) was thinking about the Eggplant Parmesan, but decided on the Crunchy Coated Snapper with Mango Relish, Crab Mat & Basil Pesto. ($19.95)\\n\\nFor drinks she had a glass of Malbec, ($7.00) which is the new Shiraz for those of you who aren't in the \\"know.\\"  I had a a Whiskey Sour. We ordered the Moonshine \\"Corn Dog\\" Shrimp with Honey Mustard and Blueberry Swirl ($8.95) for an appetizer. \\n\\nWe had heard the Corn Dog shrimp was great, and also I had heard they mix a nice cocktail.  Both of these rumors were true. Best whiskey sour I've had in a long time, and the Corn Dog shrimp were great. The batter was just perfect. Lulu loved 'em, I thought it would have been better if there was a little hot dog in there instead of shrimp. But hey, that is just me. \\n\\nUnfortunately, after the cocktail and the appetizer the meal....well it didn't really go downhill, it just never went uphill. Pretty much the appetizer and the cocktail were the highlight of the meal. \\n\\nWhen you order a dinner entree at Moonshine you get a choice of a side, and seasonal vegetables.  Our seasonal vegetables were a huge disappointment.  They were red cabbage and carrots. A fine selection for me, but the cabbage was swimming in grease, wholly inedible and the carrots were way over done. Not inedible, but not good either.  How a chef put either of those on a plate and served it is beyond me. \\n\\nMy pork chop had wonderful flavor, but it was a really tough cut of meat. It was sort of like very well flavored pork jerky. Once I learned to cut it in very thin strips and soak it in the sauce it was still pretty damn good.   I had the baked Macaroni as a side. It was good, but nothing too special. Just good. \\n\\nLulu said the Crunchy Coated Snapper had great flavor but it was a little over done, and the basil pesto didn't really go with the Mango relish or the Sesame based breading.  She had the Griddled Polenta as a side. The polenta was good, but the marinara sauce over the top didn't add much to it. \\n\\nAdmittedly, when I walked in and the Bush twins were not dancing half naked on the bar-top I was already disappointed.  But after shelling out $84.00 with tip I was a little let down.  The meal was good, not great. Maybe the problem with going out and getting southern comfort food for me is that ,in general my wife makes it better.  \\n\\nWe really like the service, and ambiance of Moonshine, I adored the front porch.  I don't think we will go back for a dinner, but we might try the brunch sometime.

The pals from LA have since told me that there is NO place in LA like Sam's, that they are jealous of me being so close and being able to eat. I told them I'd mail them a pastrami sandwich. LOL.

They had honey for dipping, it was an interesting combo.  Again I would have wanted the breading to have some bite to make the dish salty/sweet and not just plain/sweet.  Still good nonetheless.\\n\\nPargo con Pimientos - Good, a bit small so if you order it really is about 3 bites of fish.\\n\\nCalamares Fritos - Calamari, no more - no less.  Very good though. \\n\\nWe accompanied it all with a pitcher of Sangria.  Next time I will get a nice bottle of red wine, the Sangria was too sweet.\\n\\nNOW the BEST part of it was the absolutely AMAZING Almendrado for dessert. It was a Croissant with Marzipan and honest to goodness Vanilla Ice Cream on top.  The ice cream was a light brown color, and when you looked at it up close it was because you could see the ground Vanilla beans, it was absolutely FANTASTIC.

I went inside briefly to use the dirty bathroom and could see the inside is also a far cry from its former glory. The food was ok but not what it used to be. All in all a very disappointing experience from a former \\"go to\\", we won't go back."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm very shocked at the reviews for this place. Not sure who you people are but you haven't eaten good italian food in Portland. I can name at least a dozen Italian restaurants in Portland that are waaaaaay way way waaaaaay better than this place. And I have no connections with any of them. I just like to eat out. So, yes the manager is very friendly and sings to some of the patrons but the food was really bad. The noodles were all stuck together in one big glob, hardly any meat in the dish and not enough sauce. Dry... very dry. Looked like it sat around for a few hours. Yuck. There were about 4-5 different people that came to our table and I wasn't sure who the main server was. The bread was good and they were very accomodating with my son since he wanted a simple mushroom and pasta dish but it tasted terrible. I definitely won't go back.

Honestly, we had gone out with the intention of getting corned beef hash so this was a huge let down. We settled for a reuben instead, but alas when we went to order that the waitress said, we're out of corned beef hash, so we can't make the reuben.

We looked to the biscuits and gravy, another favorite of ours, and were genuinely shocked by the sticker price. $8.99!!!!! I cannot fathom how biscuits (albeit homemade) and gravy could be more expensive than some of their sandwiches. On certain items you could add a side of the gravy for $1.49 so the pricing just doesn't add up. I'd say it's fair to assume that the biscuits and gravy are a popular item of theirs and so they've hiked up the price on them; can't really come up with another explanation for why they'd charge almost 10 dollars for something that it typically $3-5 at every other location we've had them at.

We ordered a glass of prosecco to start and it was delicious and served promptly.  My appetizer, the fried artichokes, was perfect.  The batter was light enough not to overpower the artichokes and the aioli was a perfect compliment.  My husband's barbajuans were also delicious but I preferred the artichokes.  Our server was very attentive and there was always someone right there to bring the next plate or remove the old one.  Then came our entrees.  My husband had the pork special with a piece of pork presented in an artful way and some pork belly to accompany it.  I didn't taste it since I don't eat pork, but he enjoyed it immensely.  He particularly liked the pork belly.  I had the Beef Daube with Mashed Potatoes and we shared a side of the Broccoli with Garlic.  My beef was perfectly cooked, it was fork tender and the mashed potatoes were an excellent pairing with the meat and the sauce.  The broccoli was done perfectly and the most delicious broccoli I have tasted.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I do like my mashed potatoes with a bit more oomph, these were very light and thin and I prefer mine to be more solid.  The taste was very good, however.  We did not taste the desserts because we had birthday cake waiting at home, but we will be back for another special occasion and before that for the bar menu and to sample the desserts.

As an excellent server, I can't condone Ali's behavior but I COMPLETELY understand it.\\n\\nYelp!\\n\\nBaraka is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston.  Go back in a party of two or four (MAX), cozy up, share some dishes and a pitcher of cherbat, and go with the sultry flow.  That's its vibe, thats what its capable of, I don't recommend going against that flow or you'll be gypped of all they have to offer.  That's what I think."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Coming from NYC, this is like the Strand on crack.

One of the best meals I had in Portland.\\n\\nWe came in on Sunday around dinner time, and luckily there was no wait! \\n\\nFOOD - We ordered the fish sauce wings, neua naam tok (flank steak salad), and chicken khao soi (curry noodles) + an order of rice, sticky rice, and two thai teas.\\n\\nTheir famous fish sauce wings are delicious, but very very salty! I was expecting a savory yet sweet flavor, but it was only savory. However, they did pair nicely with the pickled veggies that came alongside and the rice we ordered. If you want more pickled veggies, they're an additional charge (about $2.50).\\n\\nThe flank steak salad was delish! The portion was a bit small, but it was really tasty with the sticky rice. The salad was a nice way to cut the saltiness and heaviness of the other two dishes we ordered.\\n\\nLast dish was the khao soi, which was my least favorite. I would've went with the claypot shrimp, but it was sold out. The khao soi was nicely portioned, but was very bland, yet heavy from the coconut milk.\\n\\nDRINKS - The thai teas were bottled, but they were so good! I'd recommend drinking them from the bottle vs. over ice (as served), for a stronger thai tea flavor. I would definitely buy these to-go, but IMO, they're not worth $4.50 per bottle.\\n\\nSERVICE - Our waitress was so friendly and helpful when it came to deciding what to order. I don't recall her name, but she definitely made our dining experience memorable!  \\n\\nOur food runner, on the other hand, was really impatient when it came to delivering the food. She complained that our phones (which were on the edges of the table) were taking up too much room. Like, is it our fault your tables are so small?! \\n\\nOverall, would for sure come back the next time I'm in Portland!"},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I went to Guantanamera because he loves Cuban food and was hoping it was as good as a restaurant in Miami.  Overall our food was good but not great, read further if you want more details.\\n\\nFor a starter we ordered the yuca con mojo and he had the chicken empanada and me the eggplant and mushroom empanada.  The yuca was not good.  He said his empanada was okay but he had better. My empanada was amazing, I loved it.  My empanada had a great flavor, I didn't taste mushrooms but it was still delicious. The crust was really good. \\n\\nAs for the main course I had the Tilapia frita and he had the Cuban churrasco, as our side we both chose maduro.  The maduro was described as a carmalized sweetened plaintain.  In actuality it was fried plaintain which is good but not what I expected.  I was disappointed because the description we received and what we actually had on our plate did not coincide. I'm Jamaican so fried plantain is something I commonly eat, I wanted something different. \\n\\nThe Tilapia frita dish came with no sauce, so the fish was very plain. When we ordered our entrees, the waitress asked if we wanted white rice, brown rice, or the black beans and rice mix (congri) .  My bf asked for the white rice and she asked him what kind of beans and he said black. I went for the congri.  When we got our orders his beans was mixed with his rice, so either they did not give him the correct side or they mix the beans in regardless (I am uncertain).  The congri was good but not phenomenal, the rice was slightly overcooked yet dry as if it were stale. Also, I think I bit into a small bite of meat once. Not good considering I'm pesco vegetarian. My boyfriend said his dish was just okay and the restaurant in Miami is better.  I asked for the chimichurro sauce for my fish. The sauce had a very strong garlic and lime flavor.  The sauce helped tremendously with eating my dish.\\n\\nSo aside from the small details here and there what else did I not like? The food left my stomach hurting and bloated (I suspect the rice). So even though I didn't hate the food I cannot eat there again. \\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, we went on a Friday night around 9pm. The location had several tables available so there was no wait.  The restaurant was very cold but even colder by the restrooms.  There is only one stall per gender btw. The server was attentive and nice. Parking was adequate.

Sadly my wife and I were in on a very hot day and we were totally underwhelmed. There is no sign at the door telling you to wait to be seated so we sat ourselves in the tiny dining room. I counted heads and there were 24 of us patrons- one waiter and a bartender. Shortly after sitting down I put my arms on the table whilst chatting with my wife. I felt like I placed them in greasy, oil or butter. I immediately busted out a napkin I had in my pocket and wiped vigorously. The table had not been properly cleaned before it was set- strike one.\\n\\nThe bartender came over and asked us for our drink orders- we chose the light lager and the blonde ale. Both were superb- they do good beer here! Plus one for the beer. The bartender was stressed it looked like and the one waiter came over to ask for our order. He was tired and emotionless and blandly asked for our order. My wife ordered the risotto and I ordered the chicken mufaletta. The waiter retreated with our order.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our food we noticed along with the other patrons that the AC wasn't on, internal temp of the restaurant must have been around 80 degrees. Needless to say I drank my beer and our order arrived. I wasn't offered another beer and didn't order one because I was waiting to see if it got picked up on that my glass was empty. Nope. Well another star docked for the lack of AC. I started in on my sandwich- it was overly salty and the balsamic dressing that was on it was the primary culprit but I was too hungry to care and ate it. My wife's risotto came with a little flower and red cabbage that was burned. The plate smelled rather gross not like risotto I've had prior but she took a bite.\\n\\nThe goat cheese was excellent according to her but the sauce they put on it was burned and sweet. I took a bite to verify and it tasted like ultra sweet burnt molasses that didn't go with the dish at all. She took three more bites and stopped. All the while not one person came by to check on us about our meal. Minus one star for food and one for service. We waited patiently while the waiter walked past us several times seating new customers...wait they seat people here!? Why weren't we seated and had to choose our own table? Got the check, paid and left. \\n\\nTo the owner: please train your staff better. I am not a negative nelly but I worked in restaurants as a sever, and cook for 6 years so I know what goes on in a kitchen. Also when it's hot- turn the AC on. Please; guests were sweltering- that takes away from the appeal. I would maybe go back for a beer- but I know my wife won't go back with me. I hope this place shapes up a bit- it would be a good addition to Concord."},{"name":"Mitchell's Steakhouse","address":"45 N 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow!  Fabulous dinner.

The fried calamari was good but not anymore than other places. Two of the entrees were amazing. I would come back here for those again. Now, the black pasta...there was this strange smell and with the super thick and heavy Alfredo sauce, I was only able to take a few(literally, no more than 5) bites of it. \\n\\nWe left the restaurant with our wallets about $60 lighter per person, but probably 5 lbs heavier in weight.

I'll further admit my hypocrisy in giving this a 2-star review on what I recognize could have been one-off circumstances when I routinely criticize others for doing the same.  That being said, Yelp's description of two stars as \\"Meh, I've experienced better\\" is spot on, so I'm going for it.  Carrying on.....\\n\\nAs noted, The Mark is a restaurant in the Shiloh Inn in SW Portland/Beaverton.  Loved the atmosphere; it's old school, and reminds me of the old \\"nice\\" restaurants my grandparents would take me to growing up.  I don't mean that as a criticism at all.  It's seriously a very comforting atmosphere that they should continue to embrace.\\n\\nWe went there for Sunday brunch*, and the food was very tasty, and for the most part reasonably priced (more on that in a sec).  I sampled most of what the table had, which included the Country Scramble and the Shilo Skillet, and would order it all.  Portions were generous.  My complaint: I was indecisive, and the server pushed me pretty hard towards the Chicken and Waffles, the most expensive item on the reasonably-priced menu (other than Dungeness crab something) at $13.00.  The fried chicken was good, but was limited to a single, relatively small breast, and the waffle was something I could whip up at home with store bought batter.  I know not every restaurant can be Screen Door, but at Screen Door you get 3 or 4 pieces of fried chicken for the same price.  I was way underwhelmed.  \\n\\nNow to the service. Again, I understand that service issues can be simply someone having a bad day.  However, it was bad enough that it really tainted the experience, so I'm bringing it up.  There were six of us for brunch, and we were a little nervous when our very nice but seemingly rushed server took our order (which included a few custom requests) without writing anything down.  Our nerves were justified, as noted when she came back shortly after the order having completely forgotten one of our orders and confusing another.  When the food came, the order that had requested both no cheese and no gravy had both cheese and gravy.  Another order was also without the requested change, but that was minor enough to let be.  The \\"quick fix\\" on the cheese and gravy of course was not, and led to the awkward picking at food slowly while we waited.  The server comped the $2 hot chocolate \\"for feeling bad,\\" which almost seemed worse than her not comping anything.  Topping it off, when she dropped off the check she noted the comment card and suggested we \\"let corporate know they need more help.\\"  The restaurant wasn't very crowded, and the only \\"more help\\" our server needed to make our experience 10 times better was a note pad.    \\n\\n*Note that others have mentioned a \\"brunch buffet.\\"  My wife's recollection of a brunch buffet is actually why we went, but there wasn't a buffet nor any indication that there has been one in some time.

The lobster bisque should have be called a bowl of melted butter with a few pieces of lobster, very few. As for the clam chowder... I get there are many ways to prepare clam chowder from New England (my fav) to Manhattan (my least fav). This was of the former recipe and unfortunately for this ICOB and this review, I have  a very high standard. If they were trying to do something maybe a little more authentic with the broth being really, really watery... I could possibly get over that if the flavor was there. It was not. To make matters worse the clams were barely edible and by barley I should really say it was like chewing on a piece of sinew.\\n\\nIn the end, I wanted to love this place.

We checked out the website and confirmed that, lo and behold, you can make reservations for brunch!  So we called ahead and were told to be there in an hour.  We arrived about five minutes early but only had to wait a couple of minutes before the friendliest host ever seated us (really, just a great guy!).  We had been ogling the menu while we were waiting for the table, but still had no idea what to get...so after a few more minutes of hard decisions, my partner in crime and I settled on splitting belgian waffles and a fig/goat cheese/prosciutto omelet, with some biscuits and bellinis.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the food (which came out quite quickly, I must add), there was no time to get bored--not with a cup of crayons and a paper covering on the table!  I suppose it could be seen as childish, but I'm leaning more to charming.\\n\\nThe waffles were fantastic--two large waffles fresh berries, mascarpone and whipped cream. The omelet was also really good, though I felt like it could have used some more figs and goat cheese.  We got it with home fries, which were also delicious.  The biscuits were amazing too, served with honey butter. yum.  And really, if you take nothing else out of this review: raspberry bellinis. SO GOOD.\\n\\nBeyond the food being delicious, I really appreciated the service.  When were about to leave, the rainstorm turned into a thunderstorm, and since we were in no rush to leave, we asked if we could stay for another drink.  One turned into two, and we eventually had to move because a jazz duo was setting up!  Everyone was really sweet and apologetic for asking us to move (not really a big deal, since we had been there for probably at least 3 hours at that point).

Too many times have I been recommended to go somewhere that does not serve anything other than tacos, fried food, and a menu chock full of nothing but meat meals turned veg. If you have any allergies, this is by far the place to go. The salt-free, gluten-free, oil-free, and soy-free options are impressive. My favorite and most inspiring pro of this restaurant is that the owner (Sue) is the one cooking, preparing, and creating everything. I don't know her whole daily specials and writing of the menu process, but I can taste her signature style in everything I eat, even if someone else is putting it together. I think this is the most important factor in an establishment like this. She doesn't just write a schedule, train people, and just peace out.. She really cares for every single plate sent out the window. The staff is always friendly, personable, and timely. I've never seen a single person standing at the door with a confused look on their face. The patio is beautiful and surrounded by plants. The inside decor is very well suited for a place with as equally beautiful food. Brunch is remarkable! Mimosas and specials. Awesome week day happy hour (with local beer and 1/2 off appetizers!!!!). Hearty meals that leave you feeling full and taken care of.

I moved, came back with friends, and were surprised to see no line during prime time dinner on a wknd, in a place that used to be packed.  That should have been a hint!  Soon after we learned why...\\n\\n1.  SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  There were few clients, so not that much rush.  20 Minutes after waiting, they *forgot* our order, and started from scratch.  Took 20 more minutes.  Further, they weren't even apologetic about it, nor did they compensate us.\\n\\n2.  WHERE'S THE MEAT???  I ordered my favorite dish (Bolognese) precisely because it used to be very good and plentiful.  I was utterly shocked to barely find any meat pieces in the whole container!  So, if you want to spend $11 on a whole pound of pasta and no sauce or meat... then this is your dish.  Otherwise, just buy a box of pasta, boil it, and add any generic tomato sauce, and it'll be much, uch better than this.

This isn't vietnamese, it shouldn't taste like this .\\n\\nMy friend got her pad thai and I got the drunken noodles, both of which we thought was just mediocre.

I hardly ever eat papaya salad but this salad has bold fish sauce flavor with spice and super fresh, crunchy and had a lot of roasted peanuts which I love. Muu paa kham waan was spicer (really really hot if you don't eat spicy food regularly but soooo good), so spicy it comes with mustard green under ice to cool your mouth down.

Central Square, Cambridge and some of the walk to the restaurant is not ideal if you're alone at night, but take a group to Baraka and you're in for a treat.  It feels like you're in the warm, homey, living room of a family.  Seats are covered in authentic North African fabric cushions.  Serving platters have a rustic, well-loved look.  The single best thing about the restaurant is the lemonade.  It's real, definitely had roses and ginger in it, but it's a special recipe.  Order the pitcher.  You won't regret it.  The plates are small and a bit pricey (I'm a college student), but bring a group and try lots of different dishes.  Pilaf seems to be a central ingredient.  Many good options for your vegetarian friends, but they have to be willing to try exotic (the eggplant is surprisingly good!).

It hasn't disppointed me yet!\\n\\nThe first time I came was for restaurant week in March 2012 and all 3 of us highly enjoyed our meal. What I loved is how Bistro du Midi offered a meal that was up to par with their regular menu. There's nothing more disappointing than going to a reputable restaurant during restaurant week and being met with a sub-par menu that looks much less appetizing than their regular menu. \\n\\nAll of us started with the mussels. It was a generous portion and the amazing bread basket helped us soak up the wonderful broth. For the entree, we got to taste both - the lamb neck ravioli and the hake. The raviolis were wonderful, especially with presentation in the cast iron pan, but the winner was definitely the pan-seared hake. Wow - the fish had this beautiful, but delicate crust and broth was excellent. For dessert, we had the gianduja palette w/ hazelnut ice cream and the blueberry clafoutis. Everyone enjoyed their desserts. \\n\\nThe next visit was for my birthday and once again, nothing disappointed. From the excellent service to the bread sticks, everything was as wonderful as I remembered. We started with the barbajuans - delicious! For $6, it was a great started and highly recommended. Next was the lamb tartare and fluke crudo. I love lamb and I love tartare. However, I felt the lamb taste wasn't quite there. Although it didn't taste quite like steak tartare, it also didn't scream lamb to me. The fluke crudo was excellent with lots of flavors (even the foam) and the rice puff added great texture. For our entrees, we had the sea bass and pork chop. The pork chop was the hands down winner. So juicy, tender, and perfectly brined. So stuffed, no room for dessert this time. \\n\\nBistro du Midi, I will be back!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"OK, so I had one drink at Moonshine, walked the length of the place and then left.

There's plenty of street parking. You just got to be patient to find one. I've heard about their Spicy Wings. Luckily we just missed the lunch crowd. We were seated within 10 minutes. We ordered their papaya salad ($9.00). It was flavorful. Everyone should try their spicy wings if they are here. Unfortunately, it wasn't spicy to me but gave a good taste to it. The hot sauce on the side was a perfect match. I felt it was a little bit pricey for the Spicy Wings, which was $15.00. We ordered their ribs. It was pretty small portion and the ribs was not as meaty as I had hoped for since it cost $15.50. We also had their Kaeng Dawk Kalam ($14.50) which is a Thai soup/curry with cauliflower and 2 party wings chicken. It tasted like som tum soup. Nothing fancy. Kung Op ($16.50) which is the wild gulf prawns baked in a clay pot with pork belly. Overall, I was a little disappointed with the dishes because they were small portions. The pork ribs was too salty. I asked for napkins and our server forgot. Didn't come back for a long time with my hands pretty sticky from the chicken wings and ribs. It really wasn't that busy.

When I moved back to Atlanta recently, I was excited to find that one had just opened in my 'hood. \\n\\nI started to give MF a 4-star review, but decided to revise it because I don't think it was really their fault that it was complete deadsville at Sunday lunch. Gave it a little of a boring, blah atmosphere. But I have a feeling that people just go for other options for Sunday brunch, so I decided not to let that take away from the excellent food. I would highly recommend going there for a weekend lunch due to the great lunch special they have. They have it on weekdays too, but a lot of places don't do their lunch special on the weekend so that's pretty cool. \\n\\nThe lunch special is a good deal considering the prices on their sushi (which I think, for the most part, truly do represent the quality of their ingredients). A bowl of miso soup, a really large house salad that has much more to it than any tiger salads I've had at other sushi spots, and 3 rolls. They should just leave the cucumber roll off. It's kind of dumb and adds nothing. Still worth the price  (~$16) even without it.

And might i add in that the food there also happens to be pretty delicious. \\nNow let me digress as i usually do and tell you about my most recent visit to the Cask n Flagon- Saturday night- Final Four night to be more specific walking up Landsdowne street to my left Bleacher Bar- LINE. I keep on walking my left again, people already camping out for tickets...i blurt out to them as i walk by \\" You are crazy, but i commend you\\" Next up on the walk, Game On - LINE, let me remind you that it is only 8:30... and to my right the Cask no line and i don't know why. My friend and I walk right in the front bar is pretty crowded but the back barrio sweet hidden gem of the cask... wide open the games are up on the projectors, one of the few remaining Samuel Adams White Ale taps left are flowing and a nice red bull high top table with my name on it right in the middle for perfect viewing. The crowd was awesome people laughing and just plain old having a great time. But at 10pm the sound to the game stops being brodcasted...whats this music comes on instead. What could this be...80's night, that's right 80's night. And what an 80's night it was. There was singing, there was dancing, and there was also a reenactment of the Dirty Dancing when Baby leaps into the arms of Swayze and is lifted high among the crowd, that's how intense this 80's night was. \\nI strongly advise you to check this bad boy out.\\nFinal thought in homage to 80's night- The cask n flagon you are, Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery, Just like a dream, you are not what you seem, Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there!\\nDoug out"},{"name":"Casa Arandinas","address":"9001 Brodie Ln, Ste A3","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I went with a large group for dinner recently.

Perhaps the food will make the wait in excess of two hour bearable. However, the service from a rude hostess to seating a party of 30 ahead of us when they walked in the door after we had waited 1.5 hours is inexcusable. How did that happen when you can't make reservations on Saturday night? According to the hostess, it helps when you're friends with the owner.  We knew that we were in for a wait and enjoyed a few rounds of drinks, but hostesses, please don't under-estimate the wait when we could have gone somewhere else two hour ago. The outcome, disappointed visitors from San Francisco who will NOT be recommending your place, friends who are burning money on a babysitter for nothing, missing our friends at a concert, and probably 6 bad Yelp reviews.\\n\\n=====\\n\\nUpdated after dinner.  I went from a one star rating to two stars.  The manager did the right thing and took care of our group.  Despite one rude hostess, another stepped in and actually had a clue about customer service.  The food was great.  Worth a 2.5 hour wait -- probably not.  That said, we loved the appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  The beer battered asparagus was the favorite and fondue was good as well.  Not a word was spoken when the mains were served.  Everyone was too hungry (right, after 2.5 hours) and the dishes that really stood out were... everything from the steaks, to chop, to fish.  No one shared and not a drop remained.  Somehow we still had room for dessert.  Our waitress, who was awesome!, recommended the brownie and peanut butter pie, and she was spot on.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, while I'm still peeved about the wait, the food makes Moonshine worth a visit.  A note to the owner, take reservations on Saturday.  WTF, it's not that hard!  You clearly do it for your friends.  A note to everyone else, go on a night when they take reservations."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Simply awesome...the food, the service and the scene are all top rate.

I recommend the fried calamari as an appetizer and the lobster fra diavolo as the main dish. The calamari is crisped to perfection, yet soft to chew on... squeeze that lemon on it and no doubt that it'll be devoured within a couple of minutes. The lobster fra diavolo has a kick to it (my asian family didn't know fra diavolo = spicy lol) and is a mix of lobster, shrimp, mussels, clam, and other seafood. SUPER FLAVORFUL AND DELICIOUSSS, although I wish the seafood to pasta ratio was more even. The three times I've been there was always left over pasta, while the seafood is gone. The sauce itself is also good to dip your bread in. \\n\\nI've also tried the alfredo and black ink pasta but it was not for me. The people I was with enjoyed it, but I found the calamari and lobster fra diavolo to be tastier so I would just stick to those two.

It's good.  The attitude is also good. I'll visit again."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've been going to Pho Basil consistently since moving to the neighborhood a couple of years ago.  It is my go-to place for delicious Vietnamese or Thai food.  And it's about time to finally review this place and refute some of the negative or incorrect criticism:\\n\\nFirst off: This is not, I repeat, NOT, a fusion place.  Pho Basil serves both authentic Vietnamese food and authentic Thai food. They they do not make any hybrid type dishes that would merit calling this a fusion place.\\n\\nSecond: Viet-Thai restaurants really aren't that rare. When I used to live in Vancouver and Toronto where there is a large Asian population, Viet-Thai restaurants are abundant.  And if you think about it, it's not that weird. After all, the two countries are side by side, so it's not so far fetched to think a chef/cook would know how to cook the cuisine of neighboring countries.\\n\\nThird: While I haven't had everything on the menu, there are several stand-outs. And these recommendations come from someone who has grown up on the West Coast where good Asian food is abundant.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED DISHES:\\n*Pad Thai with crispy chicken\\nThis is solid, and arguably one of the best pad thai's I've ever had. It's not soaked in too much sauce, not too sweet, not too dry, but just right. This dish tastes fresh, with the customary fixins.  And yes, it contains peanuts (contrary to another reviewer's complaint that this dish lacked peanuts).\\n\\n*Bun Thit (Vermicelli bowl) with grilled pork\\nI adore all the tastes and senses this dish evokes. Imagine a bowl of soft vermicelli noodles counter-balanced with the fresh crispness of shredded lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers and cilantro. Throw on top of that the smokiness of grilled pork which has been marinated in all kinds of goodness, a sprinkle of peanuts for crunch, and you got yourself an amazing, authentic, and well executed Vietnamese dish.\\n\\n*Crispy Spring Rolls\\nSmall bite-sized goodness that honestly rivals the ones my mom makes. \\n\\n*Massamun Curry\\nWhen this is on the menu, you MUST MUST MUST order it. Massamun is my favorite type of Thai curry dish, and Pho Basil does it well when it's on the menu.  Apparently whatever spices they use in the curry are only in season a certain time of the year. Whatever. I say everyone ask for this regardless and maybe they'll make it \\n\\n*Honorable mention goes to the roti with curry dip.  I could be wrong, but I think this is more of a Malaysian dish.\\n\\nFinally, the bowls of pho are good. Admittedly, I've had better. I wish they'd put more meat in them. However, I'm will to forgive them because of the great service and clean, new-ish restaurant. \\n\\nBottom line: Pho Basil has some misses on their menu (like any restaurant) but has far more hits.  And their hits beat all the other similar places in Boston in terms of taste, value, authenticity."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome ... came first night for fried green tomatoes appetizer.. it was amazing.

He asked what the occasion was and recommended us a table that we both enjoyed. Our reservations were at 6 on a Saturday and upon arrival, it was already quite busy.

My boyfriend, who hates celery, really enjoyed it. For appetizers, we shared the wagyu tartare and the market greens which were both fresh and tasty. They were served with breadsticks and olive oil. For our entree, we ordered the chicken for two with a side of fries. We were told beforehand that it would take about an hour to make but we were okay with that. \\n\\nAfter our appetizer, we were given another complementary dish. Foie gras!

(Its okay, though, because we ended up eating the leftovers in our hotel room at 2 in the morning.) For dessert, we got the chocolate kahlua custard which was the perfect end to our dinner. \\n\\nIn addition to a great meal, the service was also pretty amazing.

The menu is divided  into meal, appetizer, sides, and vegetables, all of which are ordered a la carte. This is fine in principle, but none of the items are innovative, flavorful, or plentiful enough to warrant their high prices. All the meal items are over $22 and come with nothing else. Examples include a small number of scallops or half of a (small) chicken or duck, all seasoned mildly, and none of which have enough protein to sate a healthy adult. The largest meal dishes I saw were whole ocean fish fried in a light batter. These look very impressive when brought out, but there is a limit to how flavorful you can make fish with this method. The $9 vegetable sides, the waiter told us, were meant to be shared by two people, but most were not enough even for that. Examples include two lightly seasoned corn-on-the-cob, completely unseasoned steamed broccoli, or fried potato wedges whose only distinct feature was being cooked in duck fat (they don't taste that different from other fried potatos). The cocktail menu was ok, and had some interesting original and classic cocktails, and were priced similiarly to other places in the area (e.i. $10). Certain cocktails were filled with ice in order to look taller than they were, which watered them down considerable as they were sipped. \\n\\nMy party was seated at a narrow picnic table on the patio with hard wooden benches with no back support. This is really unacceptable for a restaurant in this price range, patio or not. The inside walls and part of the patio fence are decorated with wooden cargo palletes. Maybe this looks interesting and \\"authentic\\" to people who have never worked a blue collar job, but to most people it's just ugly. The rough cloth napkins that leave lint all over clothing are another pseudo-rustic annoyance.

I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because for authentic Korean BBQ in Atlanta, it is simply the best. I can understand other reviewers' complaints about it's location and the decor, and if those things are most important to you, then you'll be very disappointed here. Yes, it is in a strip mall next to a shady strip club, and yes, it is very plain inside, but what do you expect from Buford Hwy?

If you're going to order just one type of meat, you can't go wrong with the short ribs. I've had their bulgogi beef and spicy chicken as well, but they're definitely not as flavorful. \\n2. For appetizers, I always go for their Pa jun (seafood pancake) or the fried dumplings. \\n3. For those times when not in the mood for something as heavy as BBQ, their other entrees are equally as good. Some of my favorites are their Bibimbop (spicy meat & vegetable rice bowl), Nakji Bokum (spicy octopus stir-fry), and Mool Naeng Myun (cold buckwheat noodle in broth). \\n\\nI know some people have complained about their prices and I too have noticed the price hike the last time I was there. Blame it on the economy, I guess, but having dined at numerous famous Korean restaurants in NY, LA and in DC, I can assure you that their prices are very reasonable.  As for their service, I've never had any problem here nor have I witnessed any rudeness to other customers.

The menu is a la cart, so vegetables and sides will run you $10 each.  Protein is between $20-30, so by the time you add a side and a veggie you are talking $40+ a person.  While Commonwealth encourages you to share the sides / veggies, the portions aren't very large.\\n\\nWe had the scallop ceviche, grilled squid app, short rib entree, and a hot fudge brownie sundae.

They are known for their Tater tots (as a dish or a side with toppings) and their FISHBOWLS!\\n\\nThe FISHBOWLS are amazing!!! Definitely try one! Yes, they are $30 but you can certainly split it with 3 or more people. As a matter of fact, to avoid getting sick, you should definitely split any fishbowl here. They have many fishbowl flavors to choose from. The server comes out to your table with your fishbowl filled with mixed juices or sodas and a pint of liquor in the other hand. Then the server pours the pint of liquor in the fishbowl and stirs it a bit for you and it's all yours to enjoy! YUM! \\n\\nIt's in a great location right across the street from Piedmont Park and has indoor and outdoor seating with heaters. All seats are pretty close to a TV no matter if you are sitting indoors or outdoors. The Nook is also great for large groups but beware they only have 2 bathrooms which are both unisex so there might be a line.

Their creamed corn is fresh and at first i thought i didnt like it and even contemplated not putting it in my to go box... while contemplating i ended up finishing it so i guess i did like it! \\n\\nAs for the sauce... i agree- the ones on the table need help. I was able to make a delicious sauce out of them though. \\nThe Alabama style white is too heavy and needs more vinegar. So i took the red sauce with pepper flakes in it (not the dark bbq sauce) and added a dash of the white and some hot sauce... AMAZING sauce. I recommend they work a little on the sauces available but trust me just do this mix and you will have a winner. \\n\\nThe manager came to check on us several times while we were eating which i appreciated.

They are still working out some kinks, as I can see the official opening date listed on a piece of stuck paper is March 14... but they are practically fully running and once we stepped in there was a lineup just to get seats. This place is like cafeteria service, lineup to wait for your seat, and order your food, pay for your meal, then sit (gets rid of the dine and dash!) eat... and get out. I like the concept, as I've been to many like this in other cities around the world. As mentioned, this place isn't that big, around 40 seats max, and we were even asked if it was ok if we were to share seating with others, which to us was fine.\\n\\nThere is quite a variety to choose, including stuff like chicken, pork and salmon steaks, curry rices, and of course... beef. Luckily there was a lineup to wait for a spot, cause to just order getting in here would be a tough call, unless you know what you are ordering. I went for the picture I saw on their wall, the signature Beef Pepper Rice, with extra beef, my brother also followed suit. We paid, we were sat, we waited! Eventually our order was coming, one by one (these trays are big, unless you want to see some aerobatics of them carrying multiples.) and smoking hot with the sort of sizzle sound effects you would expect from a hot iron plate with raw meat on top!\\n\\nI wasn't really sure what to do with my meal, as I saw a nice molded middle of rice with corn and onions on top, and the meat circling this rice like sharks circling humans before the kill. Warning, you will smell like what you ate, as the smoke/steam was coming right for me whiile putting my head above the heat. I saw the two bottles of sauce on the table and proceeded to try - garlic soy sauce, honey brown sauce. I think a tip for people who are coming in here is to show the promotional video they have on their website, as I didn't understand the teppan concept of mixing everything up while cooking, and it's really not DIY as everything is practically cooked up. I did enjoy all the flavours and the temperature at which the food was served! Hot, hot, hot... we had to flag down someone for glasses of water during our visit, compared to the other tables.. hmmm... it was busy, but we were asked many times how our meal was.\\n\\nI liked the mixture of the peppers, corn and onions with the rice and sauce, like comfort food, maybe I added a little too much sauce as I didn't get the crispy rice feel that I like. When we finished, we left, and there was quite a line-up at the door around 8 pm trying the newest thing. Outside I was fine, until the drive back to my brothers place, like a night out at the bar, the MSG (I know it was in there!) hit like a bus, dizzying effects, dry mouth, feeling out of it, worse than a dim sum coma! And then I knew.... the flavours I was tasting was enhanced, I'll give a fair shake to this place as they are still starting out and hope that the next time I come it will be better.\\n\\nWait till the hype monster dies down, as this is Richmond's brand new baby.. and everyone wants to see the baby in it's youth! The line-ups, and crowds in the front, if you are sitting anywhere near the front is a little uncomfortable. Just know that this is the same concept teppan style cooking as Teppan Kitchen in Aberdeen Centre, except you are paying a little more for an actual restaurant.

The reviews had it zooming by some of my favorites so I had high hopes for a tasty lunch. I arrived a little after noon on a weekday.  There was no one in line and no one eating at the tables.  I had read the reviews about the very nice woman running the stand, so I cheerfully told her I had never been before and asked what she'd recommend.  I got a distracted \\"Oh, it's all good\\" response and realized I was on my own.  I went with the Yelp reviews and placed an order for the small kale caesar salad and decided to try the day's special, a jackfruit teriyaki sandwich.  I'd also wanted to try a donut hole for dessert, but they had macaroons. Macaroons!  I couldn't decide, so I got one of each.  I'm just that kind of girl.   The legendarily nice lady seemed to be having an off day, bluntly informing me that it would take about five minutes and slamming the window shut without even a smile, but whatever, I'm all about the food.  When it arrived, I tore into the salad and it was *divine*.  That dressing must be made of tears of angels.  The sandwich was a disappointment.   It tasted like the sort of thing the uber-healthy friend proudly brings to a potluck and no one has the heart to tell them that it only tastes good to them because they forgot what delicious is.  The flavor wasn't offensive, but it wasn't good.  I had a few bites and called it a loss, tossing about 3/4 of the sandwich.  Both the donut hole and macaroon were fine.  But...just fine.  Certainly nothing special.  All in all, I'd only recommend the kale caesar and will likely go back for a full-sized version...and soon.   It was the only 5-star part of an otherwise 2-star meal.

Visiting Pok Pok in Portland, OR finally became a reality! \\n\\nThe family and I took a detour for lunch yesterday 4/19/15. It was a good sign since I ended up with free parking right outside the front main entrance and got seated immediately at one of the outdoor tables. Good strategy that we showed up ~11:30am since we didn't have prior reservations and shortly thereafter the line grew along the adjacent sidewalk. Thankfully, the wait staff do not hurry you along in order to turn the tables over faster. There's indoor, outdoor, and counter seating. Plus there's a takeout window available to dine elsewhere, especially on such a sunny Sunday. \\n\\nSipping refreshing pandan infused water (plus kiddo had an RC cola, $2) while perusing the detailed filled menu - goodness, what to order since one of each obviously wasn't an option! Not a problem, since the extremely personable and knowledgeable wait staff can steer you in the right direction. \\n\\nThis is what we ended up ordering for a most enjoyable shared lunch:\\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (6 whole, $14.50) marinated with fish sauce and sugar, deep fried and tossed in caramelized fish sauce and minced garlic. \\nForget KFC - these are truly finger licking good! So good that you're given a pile of napkins and WetNaps. I now totally understand why these are the wings of notoriety. \\n\\nSunny's Yam Wun Sen Chao Wong ($15) are a flavorful combo of spicy and sour glass noodles tossed with name sausage, ground pork, mussels, dried shrimp, Chinese celery, pickled garlic, Thai chilies, shallots, carrot, lime, fish sauce, and garlic oil. Balanced and lively flavors!\\n\\nKaeng Hang Leh ($15) is a Northern Thai style entr√©e with tender, sweet bits of pork belly and pork shoulder cooked in a curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric, tamarind, Burmese curry powder, and pickled garlic. This was noted as a Chiang Mai classic with Burmese origins. I enjoyed this especially with the shared jasmine rice ($2.50).\\n\\nMuu Paa Kham Waan ($15) were slices of grilled lean boar collar meat rubbed with garlic, coriander root, black pepper, soy sauce, and sugar. The slices were topped with a spicy chili, lime, and garlic sauce. This was served with mustard greens on crushed ice to help soothe the considerable burn that sneaks up on you. Literally a flavor bomb in your mouth! \\n\\nTo wrap up a memorable lunch, we shared two desserts:\\n\\nKhao Niaw Mamuang ($8.50) was sliced, nicely ripened yellow ataulfo mango with pandan scented sweet sticky rice, salted coconut cream and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Reminder me of a slightly al dente rice pudding with mango. I liked the restraint of sweetness, definitely not cloying. \\n\\nPok Pok Affogato ($7.50) was two scoops of condensed milk ice cream with a shot of Vietnamese coffee poured table side. This was accompanied with patangko, Thai style savory crullers. Now I'm going to look at cans of Borden brand condensed milk in a different light. The crullers were light and not greasy.

Then again, perhaps I simply failed to ask using the correct language (see above pox v. pok for built-in language difficulties).\\n\\nPok Pok's catfish entries were superb. Complex seasonings and garnish! Also loved the cornish game hen dishes i've enjoyed there, but this is one area I desperately wish \\"When in Rome, do as the Romans\\" still applied-- you don't HAVE to chop up a bird w/a cleaver, in big, blocky, easy-to-suffocate-upon chunks of meat with equally big bones still ensconced within!\\n\\nThe place was busy, even though late whenever I've been there.

I made a reservation for a nice mother daughter date on OpenTable, and despite our early arrival, they had no issues accommodating us.\\n\\nThey've done an excellent job redoing the interior. Pink scallop shell-shaped booths anchor the lower dining room and there's a beautiful bar covered in wooden scales. It's a nice room ideal for a romantic date or special occasion (especially when taking into account their price points).\\n\\nWe made it in time for the tail end of happy hour, and ordered a half dozen of the Shigoku oysters to share. These were delicious - smaller in size but very crisp and sweet, and great value during happy hour at half off (usually $3.75 ea). I also got a glass of the house white ($6), which was nice and dry and complemented the shellfish well.\\n\\nMost of the menu is designed to be shared, so we went ahead and did just that with the small seafood platter ($60), burrata ($17), and geoduck crudo ($16). The platter features differ by the day, but we got another half dozen oysters, ceviche, tuna tataki, hamachi crudo, king crab legs and prawn cocktail on ours. Highlights here were definitely the marinated fish. The added seaweed oil on the tataki was absolutely delicious and the Thai take on the hamachi was so refreshing. I was, however, disappointed by the prawn cocktail. They were pretty shrimpy (haha) and weren't springy at all, so I'd probably avoid ordering this in the future.\\n\\nI love burrata, and Coquille's take on it was absolutely delicious. It came with white anchovies and caponata for acidity, and was served with a side of grilled sourdough. This was a good filler item before we finished off our meal with the geoduck crudo. The thinly sliced geoduck was paired simply with some shaved kohlrabi and lemon, and was a nice, light end to our meal. \\n\\nService was very consistent and we were pleasantly surprised at the lack of errors despite it being very new. I do find their price points a little high (probably won't be ordering the $50 crab and artichoke dip anytime soon), but it's nice to have a modern fine dining option for seafood in Vancouver. With that being said, I do hope they stop serving the oyster accompaniments in little paper cups - it doesn't seem to fit the calibre the restaurant is going for."},{"name":"Jerusalem Cafe","address":"516 SE Chkalov Dr, Ste 45","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Used to come here a lot.

The patio is adorned with plenty of tables and chairs, a couch area, cigar trays, and a relaxing view of the Beltline and other restaurants behind Kevin Rathbun Steak. The hostess grabbed our group and led us to our table pretty quickly, almost exactly at the time of our reservation. Inside, the restaurant is dark, loud, and packed with business men and women. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant and as expected, greeted immediately.\\n\\nI tried the Equinox as my beverage, and this is mighty delicious if you're looking for a light, fruity drink that packs a punch. I ordered from the restaurant week as follows: Appetizer- New England Clam Chowder: Absinthe Butter, Chive; Entr√©e- 2 Bone in Beef Filets (12oz) with Gouda Cheese Whipped Potatoes and Sherry Jus, Dessert- Strawberry Shortcake. We also enjoyed a side of their best-selling side, the jalapeno creamed corn.\\n\\nThe clam chowder here is very, very good; probably one of the top three clam chowders I've ever had. The chowder has a smooth, creamy texture with light hints of bacon, clam, and potato with all three working in sync and not overwhelming. The chive also adds a subtle flavor and overall, everything comes together very well. I was truly impressed with the quality of this chowder, so much so that I even tipped my cup to finish every last drop! Definitely worth ordering.\\n\\nMore impressive than the clam chowder is the entr√©e of 2 bone-in beef filets. When we were glancing at the menu, the server commented he didn't know how the restaurant is able to serve this as one of the $35 options considering that's quite a bit of meat. Upon arrival at the table, the entr√©e is beautiful--gorgeous presentation of the two filets atop of a stark contrast in color, the whipped potatoes. One bite into the steak and I was in heaven--juicy, soft, tender, with a hint of seasoning that wasn't overpowering and really allowed you to enjoy this delicious piece of meat. I cannot emphasis how great this steak made me feel! The potatoes were a bit too salty for my liking, but it in no way ruined the dish.\\n\\nLess stellar than the clam chowder and filets were the jalapeno creamed corn and the strawberry shortcake. I felt the jalapeno creamed corn, although delicious, was nothing too spectacular and pretty heavy--probably not the best complement to a large piece of steak. The strawberry shortcake, perhaps timed poorly, arrived at our table still party frozen, with strawberry pieces that were extremely hard. I didn't finish the dessert and I wasn't a fan, but that shortcoming didn't take away from the rest of the meal.

Such was my experience at Clementine. It was like I was the dweeby new kid at school who so stupidly bee-bopped up to the new kids table and received steely glares in return for my goofy grin. \\n\\nI ordered an iced cappuccino.

I couldn't see a lot of what was going on, but by the looks of things, I can tell you what was NOT going on: cleaning. There were chips, bread crumbs, and various rubbish scattered all over the floor and especially the counter. The baked goods in the window looked...good, but from what I could tell, most of the muffins had met their end in a rough game of hackysack. \\n\\nI will say, though, that I doubt a java bar has its best employees at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

I was extremely disappointed with my lunch from Thai Sky today.  It has been over 2 years since last eating at Thai Sky after a questionable plate of Pad Thai.  I had forgotten why I didn't return until I had handed over my 5 bucks.  The food is kept in warming trays with monster heat lamps right next to the window.  The noodles are limp, over cooked, and the chicken was all the awkward dark cuts and overly dry.  I can handle dark chicken meat, but at least allow it to keep some moisture.  As I watched the server scoop my helping of Pad Thai, I promptly called an audible.  I needed something else as the nightmare of Pad Thai past returned to me.  I asked to try some of the curry, settling on the peanut curry with chicken.  It looked ok from the outside, but once I put the first bite to my mouth, my understanding of why I hadn't returned was cemented.  The veggies (carrots, broccoli, bell peppers) were all over cooked, flavorless, and tasted like something you would feed a baby.  The chicken was the same darkish, dry flavorless chunks, and the peanut curry was overly watered down and lacked the punch I like from normal curry dishes.  I was so disappointed that midway through my meal I had to stop.  I was still hungry, but I couldn't make myself eat anymore.  I was done.  And unlike the Terminator, I don't think I'll be back.  \\n\\nFor their own sake, I hope that their tofu dishes are better, my fear is that their veggies will suffer the same problems as all the other dishes as they sit under the heat lamp.

The rye bread was incredibly soft and almost tasted like it was freshly baked that same day (not sure if this is the case, but still!). The meat melted like butter in my mouth and the coleslaw was ridiculous (in a good way). I usually don't like coleslaw, but it was on point.

A real chain from Japan, Kukai is a much needed newcomer to the area and has a pretty extensive menu, which may be its main weakness. Typically ramen joints focus on one or two broth types and making those exceptional- at Kukai you can choose from shio, miso, shoyu, tonkotsu, yuzu-shio, tori... kind of like they're trying to be the \\"ramen museum\\" of the US. There are low sodium options available, but the standard miso broth I ordered needed some more punch. The yuzu shio was quite good and refreshing as expected from a more clear broth. Need to come back and try the other broths as well. Chicken kara-age was good as a side dish, but come on now- not everything needs to come with spicy mayo in America.

You're far away enough from the chefs so it's not awkward but you can still kind of see what they're doing. \\n\\nAs usual, we ordered several rolls to share. I don't remember the exact rolls we ordered but they were all pretty good. Prices are average for a typical sushi place so expect to pay around $7-9 for regular rolls and $12-15 for special rolls. Basically, just read the ingredients for each roll and order accordingly.\\n\\nWe happen to dine here on a Wednesday and the rolls were all half-off. Not sure if they still run that special but if they do, it's a great deal and allows you to try a lot without breaking the bank. \\n\\nThe service was also really friendly, smiles everywhere and we didn't feel rushed at all, despite sitting at the bar for almost 3 hours. The waitress even charged my phone while we dined as my battery was dying. \\n\\nOverall, a great place for sushi in Buckhead.

I couldn't be any more excited to visit the restaurant while on my very first trip to Portland.  I convinced all 8 of us to try this fantastic Thai place.  My friends were all excited because 1) I am Thai and 2) I am a foodie. They always trust me with my restaurant selections.  Anyway, we made reservation to dine on Sunday night.  My first impression of the place was that it was mimicking a food shack back home down to the buddhist shrine which I feel is a little disrespecting if it's only there as a prop.  I think all of the decoration there to trick you into believe this place is legit haha So we were seated and ordered the infamous chicken wings..wah wah wah..the MOST SALTY chicken wings I have ever eaten in my entire life!!! It was sooooo bad I can't believe this is THE WING everyone's been raving about!! so then came the papaya salad..are you joking me with this mediocre overpriced version of so called papaya salad!!! and the Nueu Nam Tok was so dry and SALTY.  We also ordered Goong Ob Woonsen, Kaeng Hung Leh, and Sai Uaw which all of them are surprise surprise SALTY!  The only saving grace was Gai Yang which came out well seasoned.  The portion of all the food was super small for the price so we ordered two of everything.  Besides, the server has literally no clue how to pronounce any of the food name lol If you want to have the food on your menu in Thai, you should train your servers how to pronounce it!!

I'm always happy and excited to see places like pop up around the US. I frequent places like \\"Williams and Graham\\" and \\"Green Russell\\", and this place follows suit in almost every way. They have that New York speakeasy style of atmosphere mixed with new-age attitude. Makes me feel like they take their drinks seriously, but really the goal of it all is to have fun doing it. While I was a little underwhelmed with the \\"Island Old Fashioned\\" I received, all the elements where there and it was better then 80% of them I have had at other places. After that I had the \\"Left Eye\\" this was a fantastic drink and I'm quite glad I ordered it. The only thing I wish it had was a tiny bit of bite (slice of jalape√±o). That would really make it a great drink. \\n\\nIn addition, I ordered the \\"Chorizo Stuffed Calamari\\" which was quite tasty and went along well with my drinks. \\n\\nRight before I left, Fidel (I'm sorry of that is wrong, I am terrible with names) offered his take on a Fireball. He had mixed in his own amount of cinnamon and let peppers, which his friend grew, soak in the liqueur. This was his second attempt at it, and I must say that It was a lot better than I expected. This is the reason I love places like this, the bartenders take pride in what they do and they want to show their customers that fact.\\n\\nSo, as a little advice, if you are looking to go out, take it easy, and have a nice talk with good company, this is the place. Its quiet enough that you can hear the people you are sitting with and enjoy sipping on your drinks.\\n\\nFor the people that claimed poor service and other issues with the staff, I did not experience that. Either way, expect slower service. This is a proper cocktail lounge, not some college bar were you have to shout to get drinks. Good drinks take longer than 5 seconds to make.

If I'm passing near-ish the area during the day, I always contemplate popping in.

I don't want \\"fluffy\\" pancakes, fruit, home fries, thin \\"crispy\\" bacon, bleh, bleh, bleh. I want serious pancakes, serious bacon, eggs done simply and right, and endless coffee. In lieu of a flight to Minnesota, the Allston Diner is a perfectly adequate substitute. I especially dig their high-caloric chicken and waffle with the optional side of sausage gravy -- while chicken and waffle dishes are showing up on more and more menus, some rather tasty, when I'm really craving one, this place always comes to mind first. Biscuits and gravy with a side of sausage also works for me. And when I finally worked up my nerve to assemble a Midwest-style breakfast -- a short stack of pancakes with sides of eggs and bacon -- I was very, very pleased with the result, especially the pancakes: thin-ish, crispy-ish, with very nice flavor (if you need to add fruit to your pancakes, it's likely they are not very good pancakes.) It wasn't that cheap ordering it this way, but it sure beats the price of a plane ticket. And yes, getting one cup of coffee gets you an endless supply. And their specials have been genuinely special,  from a bacon pancake to a breakfast quesadilla.\\n\\nSome people might consider all this to sound suspiciously unhealthy, but...you'll likely see beefier folk at the more frou-frou, fruit-fruit places (but they do vegan here rather well, so word on the Interwebs has it....)\\n\\nOne bit of caution: they can't handle large groups -- four is the limit for seating."},{"name":"Pho Hong","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite plate to order is the shrimp vermicelli with the spring rolls, which the peanut sauce is really good!

Its kinda hidden next to Hotel Commonwealth and has an understated entrance. Nonetheless, as soon as you walk in you know its a more upscale sort of place due to the modern interpretation of a \\"seafood place decor.\\" I really enjoyed the atmosphere but I did feel a tad under dressed.

On a side note, I am definitely going back and trying to sit at the bar; it looked like a fantastic time. But for this review, we'll stick to floor service.\\n\\nThe Service was fantastic. We were immediately greeted by Tara and poured water. She did a great job recommending beer for my dad, I forgot my ID so I couldn't try the cocktails, but they looked fantastic. She steered us through the menu, actually picking all the food for dad, not telling him what he was getting, just bringing it. Tara was always there refilling our water and making sure we were okay. When a party of 20 or so was sat, the rest of the staff (including a nice piece of eye candy from Wisconsin) made sure we were not ignored. \\n\\nOnto the food.\\n\\nThe bread and cayenne/honey butter they bring to your table is awesome. Kinda want to steal the butter recipe. But moving on, we started with the bay scallop appetizer (Tara's pick) which was to die for. Unbelievable flavor, superb quality scallops, and overall fantastic presentation. If this was offered as a full size meal I would get it every time.   I also ordered the arugula salad which had an amazing balance of tartness, nuttiness and sweetness. I had it prepared sans beets and was still in love. The portions were a little large for appetizers but not quite large enough for entrees; which is slightly unfortunate because the entrees left a bit to be desired. I chose the baked cod over beans, carrots, celery puree, and chorizo. The meal was cooked very well and with quality ingredients but the overall flavor was not as quality as I expected, ESPECIALLY after such amazing appetizers. The breading on the cod was bland and the chorizo overpowered the fish. Cod is such a light fish and the dish just wasn't balanced. I'd take all the ingredients separately (as long as the fish lost the breading.) Tara brought my dad the fish and chips. The fries were unbelievable. A little soggy but the flavor was SPOT on. The fish itself was okay. The batter was a bit flavorless. Again the fish was great quality but just couldn't stand up to the appetizers. I've had better fish and chips (try the Reginas in Allston when its on special!) but it wasn't bad. The malt vinegar aioli was great though! Dip the fries in it! Oh, and the chowder our server brought us? Epic.\\n\\nI don't eat oysters but the oyster bar was spectacular and the table next to us couldn't stop raving about them. You'll have to ask other reviewers about them! \\n\\nOverall I enjoyed the experience, the appetizers, and the great service but for the price, I was disappointed in the entrees.

Lamar, I dumped Din Ho and started going up there for Chinese BBQ. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one, and it got pretty crowded, and they'd consistently run out of ducks, or chickens, other tasty animals. After a few times of coming home empty handed, and hungry, I thought I'd give Din Ho another chance. To my surprise, the place wasn't like I remembered it. They were friendly, and they had all the deliciousness I could want. So I've been back with them for about a year. Unfortunately, my last few meals there have been super bland.

Before half way through our meal, we realized that we might need to order more food, so we turned to the only server (an old lady with glasses) and asked for 1 additional appetizer and pasta. Well first she ignored us, then after we asked her a second time, she gave us a dirty look and said \\"I don't know if we can do this for you, there are a lot of people waiting in line\\". (To be exact, there are only two tables waiting, and about two tables paying their bills at the same time). She ended up placing the order for us, but what she did killed everyone's mood. What she said was so pointless because there was no one in line after we left with plenty of empty tables around.\\nYes, I understand that every restaurant wants to turn over its tables faster to make more money, but I have never been to one that discourages customers from ordering more in such a nasty way.

We came around 6:30 on a Thursday and it was. A busy night. Called ahead but they don't take reservations so it's first come first serve. We were to wait about 45 mins. per the hostess. So we went to the bar to wait and get our moonshine on. I tried the strawberry moonshine (delish) and my friend had the prickly pear (very strong and tastes like tequila). About 25 mins later or so our table was ready and we went to eat outside in what felt kind of like an opened up cabin area. \\n\\nWe started with whole garlic with bread (basically garlic butter which I've made before and it was magical). We ordered fried green tomatoes and they were out-of-this-world. Unfortunately my friend doesn't like seafood so he wasn't excited that there was shrimp on top of them (more for me!) and typically won't eat anything that even touches seafood. But after trying a bite of a \\"non-contaminated\\" one, he had no prob eating a few more that I carefully ensured had no seafood on it or scent. Those were hands down my fave fried green tomatoes ever in life (only had once before, but I mean if you tried it you'd understand). The batter they use on it is amazing and would probably make a boot taste good. The aioli type sauce on the bottom had a little heat and went absolutely perfect with the tomaters. Just trust me when I say if you don't have any food restrictions, you must get the fried green tomatoes.\\n\\nOur entees included a trout dish with a side of green chile grits and a chicken almondine with grits. Both were absolutely yummers and I'd definitely come back here again.

I was curious as to what was drawing in the huge line. I waited for the line to die down and took a stab to see what this food vendor was all about. Low and behold...Top Food Vendor at this regatta. You know its a great spot when other food vendors at the race were coming to eat here.\\n\\nThey were selling a dozen oysters for a $12 and most of their other food items(ex. Oyster Sliders)on the menu were also cheap, probably due not having to pay for wait staff and they worked the tent like a Hole-in-the-wall joint. Despite good prices, they did not skimp on quality and was definitely their selling point for me to try out their restaurant. I was looking forward to my next visit to Boston.\\n\\nA few months later, I'm back in Beantown and craving something that has been out of arms reach. I went there on a Saturday night and went without a reservation and tried to get a seating for two...3 hour wait. I don't think anything is worth that amount time for a meal, so I bailed a went somewhere else close by. However, determined to eat here, I assumed they would not have a crowd in the afternoon on a Sunday and my intuition was right. I got a seat when I walked in the door. \\n\\nI had the Island Creek Oysters, the Oyster Sliders, and The Lobster Roll. The oysters were fantastic. Im usually a fan of Kumamoto but these are slowly becoming my favorite. It's always a plus when you are the source for the oysters. I remember having 6 sliders when I was at the regatta but I resisted and only bought two since I wanted to try something else on the menu. After longing to eat these again, I was still blown away by these little bites.  Not over done and simple. Finally I got to the main dish I ordered and got my chance to sink my teeth into their lobster roll. I don't have much of a base for comparison for other rolls but this was still a well made dish. The chips were made from scratch, not bagged and the sandwich itself was just great. It wasn't killed with mayo and lobster meat wasn't skimped on. \\n\\nOverall, this place does the one thing that a restaurant is supposed to do...make the food shine.

The wings had a nice crisp to it but it was way too salty for everyone.\\n\\nWe also ordered some short ribs that came with two sauces - one tasted like sweet chili sauce and the other was sort of like fish sauce. The ribs were tender and flavorful but also once again, very salty even with rice. This place was ~$16 for 4 ribs :(\\n\\nBack at home, when I order Vietnamese iced coffee, it comes in a regular cup size. At this location, it appeared my coffee was shaken up in a cocktail mixer with ice then poured out. It filled up only half of a to-go cup so I was disappointed that I paid $5 for so little coffee!! It wasn't as strong as I had hoped either (I thought the coffee would be strong since they gave me so little but I was wrong).\\n\\nYou're supposed to get what you pay for and I don't believe my family and I got the flavor and satisfaction from our meals for that. Service was okay.. \\n\\nI also think it's unsanitary that a part of their kitchen is right where you wait for the restrooms!! So if 3-4 wait around the area, it's a traffic jam because you have servers coming through with dirty dishes or servers coming through with someone's order.

I sat outside for lunch on a beautiful September afternoon on my day off from work and ordered a Chardonnay.  The wine came and it either tasted like a pinot gris or the glass still had soap in it from the dishwasher.  Either way I drank about 1/2 of it and then asked the waiter if it was really a Chardonnay.  Of course he said yes but I knew he had poured whatever white wine they had open.  Probably because he was too lazy to open a bottle of what I had actually ordered.  The food was good as usual but the waiter was obnoxious.....long curly hair with a mustache that curled up on the sides.  Yuck!!!  When I inquired whether the wine was a Chardonnay or something else he said \\"I'll show you the bottle\\", like that would make a difference.  Then he brought me a taste of something I \\"should have ordered\\" in his opinion and tasted exactly the same.

I had a greek side salad and a falafel wrap.  My friend had a chicken salad.\\n\\nWhat a disappointment.  As mentioned in another review, the toppings were very skimpy.  The falafel balls themselves were freshly made and tasty.  The whole wrap seemed skimpy and lifeless.  The greek salad was a handful of lettuce, 6-8 small chunks of each tomato, cucumber and some purple onion.  A little feta cheese and dressing topped it off.  The volume of lettuce dominated the salad with any other ingredient hitting your palate as an occasional treat.  The overall quantity of salad was really little in light of the composition and the hefty price.\\n\\nMy friend didn't enjoy his salad.  His primary complaint was that the chicken was tasteless.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen behind the counter were pleasant albeit a bit slow.

You know the mother that tortures her kids by demanding they finish all the food on their plate.  Kiku is the Mommy Dearest of restaurants, the demanding creature that insists you be a member of the \\"Clean Your Plate Club,\\" ensuring you become an overweight adult.\\n\\nYikes!  Kiku actually insisted I eat all the rice balls under my sushi selections.  It would be one thing if Kiku's sushi rice was flavorful and moist and quite another if I selected in total more than 8 or 10 sushi pieces that day.  Yet both are not true.  Kiku said they would charge me for each rice ball left over.  Really - how much?  I'm trying to low carb it and did not prefer the taste, so I said \\"Charge away.\\"\\n\\nWhat if I had gotten a sampling of something on my plate I did not enjoy?  Would Kiku have insisted I eat that as well?  That is what our table sign requested of each guest.  \\"Eat our Food.\\"  Are they going to sit by and watch, ensuring.  What a hoot!  Unbelieveable.\\n\\nIt would be a different story if anyone at our 12 top table was wasting food.  But we were all very considerate buffeters.  I am an incredible adventuous eater, yet how dare you tell me what to eat and worst demand I eat something.\\n\\nAnd speaking of tables, while I too enjoyed the decor of this tiny spot the typical vibrant red, aisan lettering littering the drapes, etc. our table was too close to the wall and door frame and everytime any one needed to get up and well this is buffet, it is what you do, I had to move to give way for passage.  Ridiculous.\\n\\nBut worst of all were the after effects.  Kiku's food is laiden with MSG (i.e. preservatives, toxins).  Being of light hair, light skin and light eyes (i.e. an English/Irish/German Mut American), I suffer from many allergies and have with intention created an intolerable immune system to food addiitives.  I am a 15 year and counting naturalist.\\n\\nWhy would I avoid prepackaged foods advertising food addiditives/toxins like a she devil, only to be seduced by freshly prepared foods and come on - raw fish laiden with a gut retching blanket of MSG.  While full, I was sick the rest of the day as said toxins crept through my system.  Throbing headache, gut ache and gas, nauseus and irritible.  Great!\\n\\nIf you have an iron gut and no concerns with regard to toxins, highlights were the sliced oranges, fried sugar dough balls, red snapper sushi and fried cod with a delicious sauce.  All of the \\"real\\" sushi selections could have had more flavor/been more luscious perhaps fresh.  They too were dry.  Kiku could be improved by altering their sushi rice and offering a sashimi alternative.

I'm from the southwest, and every other Mexican place I've been to out in Las Vegas served the chile relleno as a big poblano pepper stuffed with cheese, with a little cheese on the outside, and they're usually phenomenal-you cannot screw this dish up. Unfortunately, Monterrey did. They placed a deflated pepper at the bottom of the plate, layered with beef and cheese on top. Bleh. \\n\\nThe enchilada was ok, and so was the guacamole, but false advertising makes me sad. It boasted authentic Monterrey food, which I really feel I didn't get.  If they're attempting to cater to the non-latino population in Smyrna, they're probably spot on.

So it was with great anticipation that we recently met friends for dinner at Ray's.  The transformation was impressive.  The clean, modern decor made for an inviting evening and is such an improvement over the previous Pasta House.  The tables were not crowded together, so even while our table seemed to be a bit small when trying to hold large, awkward menus and 4 X 4 sets of glasses, I found it to be comfortable.  Unfortunately, the beautiful bare floors, walls, and windows made the main dining room impossible in which to converse.  What started as a low din increased with each new arriving customer and by the time we left, my throat was irritated from trying to yell across the table.  As for the food, our friends shared the blistered shishito peppers with cauliflower and said it was very good.  I ordered 2 shrimp from the raw bar.  My husband ordered 2 different kinds of oysters which the server could not tell him anything about until she checked with someone in the kitchen.  He told me the oysters were \\"fine\\" but not something he'd want to return for.  My shrimp were just that...shrimpy.  However, when it came to our entrees the four of us were very pleased.  My friend and I ordered their crispy redfish and I have to say it was delicious!  However, the white bean puree that came with it was a disappointment as the whole beans were undercooked, hard and cold.  The pairing of it with the fish was a great thought but not appetizing because of it's temperature and texture.  The wine selection was acceptable.  Our server seemed to be nervous and new to the job.  I expected sketchy service since the restaurant is still within their \\"soft opening\\" stage.  She was very nice and eager to please but made mistakes and interrupted our conversation (which was already annoying because of the room noise.)  She was polite, however, so we left her a nice tip.  Our spouses enjoyed their osso bucco very much.  We skipped dessert.  In summary, we will return to Ray's.  My husband and I prefer to sit at the bar and their bar certainly looked beautiful and busy.  We will definitely try it the next time.

I got a little confused when I got there, but it made sense.\\n\\n They had a special for june where you get an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 desserts for 30 bucks. The girlfriend and I got their appetizer special which was a crab cake ball, it came in a creamy citrus sauce that was plate licking good. We followed that up with the traditional spaghetti spaghetti and meatballs which was everything you would expect with a side salad and foccachia bread. For the second entree we wanted to do something different so we got the sausage meatball in spicy pork sauce over white bean ragu. That was my favorite, it was different and the combination was interesting. My gf preferred the traditional spaghetti and meatball. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the 2 desserts they offered. The cannoli had a pretty look to it, by making the marscapone into a flower. The lemon sfogliatelli was a star. It's served nice and warm and should be eaten right away with your hands. The pastry was crispy on the outside and the recotta cheese was so smooth.\\n\\nWhile we were dining a gentleman came in and wanted to buy meatballs for father's day Sunday but was planning on reheating on sunday.

Friends going, raving about it. Just an overall buzz that it was the best burger in town....top of the list, and close to everyone's heart. My neighbourhood burger place (The Red Onion, two blocks away) closed for good, and I was looking for a new place to go for a burger. I eat very little meat these days and a burger, for me, is a special treat, once every couple of months and so, being special, it has to be the best. Again I asked friends, and again I heard back, overwhelmingly, MODERNE!!! We went tonight, and it was outstanding. Beyond the highest recommendations I'd heard. We were immediately made to feel relaxed, welcomed and right at home. Pete took our orders, and not only answered our typical \\"newbie\\" questions, but had so much useful info to impart about the burgers, the size of them, whether we should order double patties or not, the shakes and floats and malts. Just incredible service, right out of the gate and we weren't let down through to the final laughs and handshake at the till. The burger tasted so fresh and pure....if that sounds like a weird way to describe a burger, so be it. Unadulterated. Big, but not \\"unhinge your jaw\\" big; more like \\"full size of the bun\\" big. Perfect, perfect combination of sauces, lettuce, onion and tomato. And the Coke Float was superlative; our wait staff brought a glass of Coke and left it on the table, so I could refill my float. I mentioned to Pete that we used to make them with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla....and he said \\"Let me bring you a scoop of chocolate!\\" I declined. At first I was wondering why Moderne didn't have desserts on their menu; at the end of our meal, I understood why, completely. This is the full meal deal, folks. Completely fulfilling in every way. No dessert needed, nor wanted. Moderne. Check it out. Excellent, fresh food. Quick, friendly, courteous and top-notch service. I will be back. Probably soon. Likely quite often.

Unfortunately all they have for take-out lunch is a list of 4 sandwiches. They are all between 9 and 10 dollars which is somewhat typical for the area. So I dove right in and ordered the steak and cheese. I was shocked when they handed it to me to see that my 10 bucks got me about a 5\\" sub. I was even more shocked when I got back to the office and it was cold. \\nStep up your game commonwealth... you have so much potential. To get a cold steak and cheese, it is obviously pre-cooked in the morning or something. You cant claim local and fresh and then pre-make your food.

This place is just simply amazing. \\n\\nIn kind of a weird location, between a couple of hotels and upscale shopping locations on Boylston Street, Bistro du Midi is nestled in a difficult-to-notice spot, so difficult, in fact, that in the many years I have been living in Boston, I had never noticed it before. I walk along this stretch of shops many times a week, yet have never stopped in. Such a shame, too, for it is one of the best restaurants in all of Boston.\\n\\nDog-tired after carrying my best friend's 35 pound two year old all across Boston for Disney Princesses on Ice (so cute, but so tiring!), my fiance had to drag me out to dinner. We couldn't decide where to go, so we figured we would try this place, having just noticed it for the first time. \\n\\nWe sat down in Bistro du Midi's bar area, which is first come first serve, for at 7pm on a Saturday, the place was packed upstairs in the main dining room. We immediately grabbed a table by the window, overlooking the gardens, with the twinkling holiday lights outside. Quite romantic for a spur of the moment meal decision.\\n\\nWe started with cocktails and yummy oysters. My fiance had a Sazerac which many bartenders do not know how to make, but this one made a killer drink for my man. And the oysters. Oh yes, the oysters. Briny Virginian and Sweet Nova Scotian. Yum. The vinaigrette the chef made was very herbal, and the vinegar was quite thick. A great pairing to the oysters. \\n\\nNext, my fiance had a beet salad with goat cheese and a lemon vinaigrette. Now, many places do a beet salad. I love 'em. But this one is special. Up until now, my favorite had been Thomas Keller's Bouchon in Vegas. Bistro du Midi's is better. The creamy goat cheese, the greens, and the beets are perfectly paired. No single ingredient outweighs another. And, the vinaigrette is tangy, sweet, and simply yummy. \\n\\nI started with the crispy pork belly with ratatouille. So freaking good. The sauce was rich and complemented the pork so nicely. And the veggy ratatouille was amazing. The care in chopping each of the veggy pieces so perfectly and consistently did not fall on blind eyes. The dish just looked beautiful.\\n\\nNext, my fiance had the Beef Daube. Man, oh man, after marinating these hunks of meaty goodness for days upon days in red wine, this was a carnivore's dream. Fall-apart goodness in a bowl of redwine glaze that made you want to lick the bowl clean. Even with my sweet 89-year-old British Nana's voice in my head reminding me of my manners, it was hard not to lick this stuff up. And the mashed potatoes were creamy and garlicy, a perfect pair to the beef.\\n\\nBut my main was the real winner (if you can even compare the dishes). I had the Coral Infused Chitarra Pasta with Main Lobster, Sea Beans, and Lobster Jus. I love lobster. But this takes lobster to a whole other level. The pasta is handmade, pink, and delicious. The lobster chunks were plentiful. And the sauce. Oh, the sauce! Thick, creamy lobster sauce that is just incredibly rich and balanced. The sea beans add an extra salty crunch to the dish. Yum.\\n\\nFor dessert, my man had the Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Cake with Salted Ice Cream, which he said satisfied all of those cravings-- sweet, salty, crunchy, smooth-- in a single bite.  I had the lavender beignets with chocolate sauce. Oh boy, these things were filled with a lavender cream that tasted oh so good. And the chocolate sauce just blew the beignets out of the water. \\n\\nWhile our meal was exquisite, what sets this place even further over the top is the service. We had two excellent servers, one at the beginning of the night, who gave us excellent app and entree suggestions, and one who took our table over after he and my fiance hit it off talking about cocktails. He ended up pairing every one of our dishes with a different wine, and surprised my fiance with an excellent special after-dinner drink at the end of our meal. He was so knowledgeable, and we were so impressed by his attentiveness. The meal was special to begin with, but the quality of the staff is impeccable.

Service was excellent, as was the ambiance. I ended up ordering the Pissaladi√®re for an appetizer. It was cooked perfectly, with flaky crust and a generous helping of anchovies. I ordered the Steak Frites, and although the fries were excellent, the steak itself was rather tough. To make matters worse, I had ordered it medium rare, but was served slices of steak that still had a pulse. The steak was also rather tough (due in no small part to the rareness). In fairness, my idea of medium rare might lean more towards medium, and I also did not raise the issue with my waiter (who was excellent), so this shouldn't count against Bistro du Midi too much. My other small gripe was over the price they charge for a Kronenbourg draft. While I have no complaints about the beer itself, Kronenbourg is more of a mass-market beer in Europe (slightly better than a Bud in my opinion). I know restaurants in general add crazy markups to booze in general (and beer and wine in particular), but $9 for a pint of Kronenbourg is pretty high. If they started offering something of a higher quality (anything Belgian like Chimay or Duvel), I would gladly shell out $9 (or more). I plan on checking out Bistro du Midi's dinner offerings in the future, so my review may end up being higher. Until then this place is still a solid choice, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably order the croque madame (which looked excellent)."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"A very unassuming location and restaurant.

I've had Maxine's (in Indianapolis).  Now, I've had Allston Diner's (doesn't quite have the same ring).  You know what I'm talking about, the beloved and much sought after: Chicken and Waffles.  \\n\\nAs Allston goes, my first impression: Hipster.  If ever there was a brunch place that deserved \\"hipster ambiance\\", it's this place.  Teal and black theme, scantily clad walls, servers required to have strange tattoos, and patrons too I think... The only way to describe I would say is \\"Hipster South\\".  Anyway, it was pretty busy on a Saturday morning and we had to wait.  Apparently, Allston Diner won't take parties of more than 4, there was only 2 of us (thank God).  They also don't really have any waiting room, so be prepared to stand in line outside during peak hours.  While we waited, I took notes for my stomach.\\n\\nDef getting the biscuits and def getting the chicken and waffles.  That's not enough for this groupon--also getting an omelete wrap (aka breakfast burrito).  Now, from worst to best:\\n\\nBreakfast burrito: Meh.  Kinda disappointed. Potatoes were awesome, but the wrap was drippy and tasteless.  However, made me feel less guilty than my other food choices (see below).  It also made me realized that when it comes to food: as guilt increases, deliciousness also increases. \\n\\nChicken and Waffles: So good. Three huge fried chicken wings. Corn-breadish type waffle (if it wasn't in the description I wouldn't have known is was corn bread), and unfortunately not real maple syrup.  Give me real maple and I will give you five stars. \\n\\nBiscuits and the Water of Heaven (aka gravy): this biscuits and gravy was the pinacle of our Allston Diner experience.   I love biscuits and gravy, but THIS biscuits and gravy is in a league of it's own.  I think Jesus returned and is the back of Allston Diner making the gravy--IT IS UNREAL. I want to be BAPTIZED in this gravy.  I'll never look at biscuits and gravy the same ever again, and now, neither will you.  \\n\\nWas this the best Chicken and Waffles I've ever had?  No.  Was it the best chicken and waffles I've ever had in New England?  Hell yes.  Was it the most memorable gravy I have ever eaten? Sweet Jesus! Mary! Joseph! Amen! Yes."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"It may be the best oyster bar in Boston. It is most certainly the best oyster bar I've ever been to, anywhere. The setting is grand and statedly masculine with its swooping ceilings, wood and metal furnishings, a tactile wall constructed of oyster shells, a mammoth, hanging light fixture that feels more work lamp than chandelier, and the vaguely apocalyptic mural that steals focus along the bar's back wall. But there are soft touches too, like cushy banquette seating, a smiling hostess eager to please, and the warm glow of dim light. Which is to say nothing of the first-rate oysters or the rest of Chef Jeremy Sewall's seafood-centric menu that expertly blends classic and contemporary New England cuisine. As far as I can tell, Island Creek Oyster Bar is in a league of their own.\\n\\nI came late to oysters. It took a good 24 years before I could stare down a bivale and slurp it up. My boyfriend has been tossing them back since he was four, so he's got two decades on me and a deeper appreciation for mollusks from every maritime. Truth be told, until our first outing at Island Creek, I claimed not to enjoy East Coast oysters at all. They tend to be bigger, brinier and are harder for me to get down. West Coast oysters on the other hand, have always held more of an allure in my mind; small, supple and smooth, I was convinced I would entertain a future of Kumamotos and Shigokus without every venturing into Atlantic waters again.\\n\\nSo it was with baited caution on my first visit to ICOB that I set upon ordering their provincial Island Creek oysters. And boy, am I glad I did. I loved them. They were clean, silken creatures with a subtle saline bite, wetting my palate and setting the stage for the multi-course meal that was to follow.\\n\\nThe menu changes regularly at ICOB, but if you're lucky enough to catch them while in season, may I recommend the fried, sweet Maine shrimp, the playful twist on lox made with Arctic char, the lobster roe noodles accompanied by grilled lobster and braised short ribs and the local clam chowder seasoned with house-cured bacon and a floating buttermilk biscuit-bar none, the best chowda' I've ever tasted. Less successful dishes included the lobster risotto (bland and gummy) and the crab carbonara (lacking lusciousness). While the place isn't perfect, the wine list, spirits menu and savory-sweet desserts are rather spot-on. Opt for hard to find bottles of white like the Jacques Puffeney Arbois Chardonnay from the Jura region of France, paired alongside a key lime parfait sandwiched between layers of chantilly cream...an utterly crave-able combination.\\n\\nIsland Creek Oyster Bar elevates the everyday oyster shack. I've been to ICOB twice, both times for a special occasion. Most recently, I celebrated my birthday there with my two best girlfriends. As perfectly apropos for a night out on the town with my ladies as it is for a romantic dinner for two, I needn't wait for my next celebratory excuse as a reason to return."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"You will not be disappointed with Nori Nori.

That being said, I got the distinct impression that brunch here is pretty much an after-thought and if you're willing to half-ass your brunch I'm not interested in coming here for your dinner no matter how good it may be. \\n\\nWe had oyster sliders. They were ok. Too much brioche to oyster ratio in my opinion. One oyster per slider? It was a tasty oyster and it was dressed nicely but the portion was stingy. \\n\\nWe had the island creek oysters as well which were fantastic. But that was no surprise. I've had more than enough island creek oysters at other places to know they can do a raw oyster like nobody's business. Big deal. I was hoping to be impressed by more than the raw oysters. \\n\\nWe had a decent salad with beets and pistachios among other things. But again it's not hard to make a nice salad. \\n\\nWe also had a couple of lobster rolls and this is where the true disappointment set in. It definitely seemed as though the salad was mixed the day before (or earlier). It didn't have that magnificent freshly made taste that Neptune has. There was a large portion of lobster which was nice but the whole thing lacked flavor and excitement. \\n\\nAnd the house made potato chips that came with it could have been outstanding but they weren't. They were cold and soggy. If they were hot and crispy I'm sure they would have been delightful, but they weren't.\\n\\nEven the bloody Mary was less than memorable. \\n\\nIt was a bday celebration so we wanted dessert. The only thing that sounded appealing was key lime pie, but they were all out. We skipped dessert. \\n\\nI'm sure I didn't give them a chance to wow me with their cooking and some day I probably will but its going to take a while for me to give them another shot.

T\\n\\nThe I.C. Oyster slider was a phenomenal lil treat the spicy chili ailoli complemented the cool leaf and tomato with the warm brioche roll and hot fried oyster was great. \\n\\nI tried the harpoon barrel 100 which was an oyster stout and it wasn't bad a cold type of non heavy Guinness. \\n\\nWe were totally WOWED by the entrees. My better half got the lobster roe noodles and it was a $27 bowl of heaven for a seafood place this dish had pieces of braises short rib that was better cooked than a steak house the peas were so fresh they popped when you bit into them. \\n\\nI had the best fish dish I've had in a long time, and I'll say second all time to the Macadamian Crusted Ahi at the Lahania Fish Company in Maui. I had line caught cod served over rice artichoke hearts, and chorizo with four Island Creek Clams, it was culinary perfection.

Judging by the first couple days of opening by Managing Director Leigh Angman, brother Todd (Relish) and Steve Duyzer, (formerly GM at Stanley Park's Fish House and Exec. sous chef), they have already managed to blow their competition right out of the water! \\n\\nJust after 24 hours of opening, we decided to check it out and it did not disappoint. From the time we entered until departure, our service by Ben and surrounding waitstaff was warm, friendly and welcoming. I would definitely return (as a local) and recommend to tourists, too. (And if you know me, I don't recommend anywhere on Granville Island.)  Finally, a place that has found its sea legs! \\n\\nOrder: decent wine list; my favoured Sandhill Viognier was not offered by the glass but they made an exception. I was starting to like this place already and I hadn't even tried the food! The wine selection seemed pretty decent by the glass, but was better by the bottle. \\n\\nSmoked Trout Dip- smoked to order lake trout, zucchini & spinach, pickled vegetables, fry bread -$16.99 Although the fry bread did not match the amount of dip (don't you hate that?) for an extra $3.99 we ordered more. This was one of our favourite dishes. Upon our server's recommendation, we chopped up the trout to mix in with the dip. Delicious! It would have been nice had there been enough fry bread to begin with however. Bread is cheap; come on guys! As good as it was, a bit overpriced, all things considered.\\n\\nGreen Goddess Salad- sweet West Coast greens, roasted tomatoes, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, goddess dressing- pretty standard, but also quite tasty and nicely presented. \\n\\nSmoked Salmon Sockeye lox, dill cream sauce, mozzarella, provolone, pickled red onion, capers $17.99 - We were hyped up for the pizza after trying the fry bread. While there was an adequate amount of salmon which can be sparse on this type of pizza, nary a caper was to be found which was a bit disappointing. I found myself longing for a small lemon slice, too, as this is a dish that I often make at home, and a bit of acid to offset the fishiness goes a long way.\\n\\nTrio of fish: salmon, ahi tuna and arctic char, this was also beautifully presented and did not disappoint. Next time, I would just order the salmon as that was the definite hit. The potatoes and few pieces of asparagus and carrots accompanied well, but if only there had been a few more. These things are inexpensive, so why not add on just a few extra?\\n\\nMaple Creme Brulee with Peanut Brittle and a Maple Chocolate- the brulee did not taste as fresh as it could have been and was just okay, but the brittle and the chocolates were the hit here. Not a bad finish to the meal, however.\\n\\nSo, all of this for three people at roughly $60 per person with a 20% tip and we were not disappointed. While a bit pricey for what you get, like most places on the \\"island\\" you do pay for the view, but finally we could dine at a place with some brains to match the braun.

Granted this was not a trip where I did extensive research on restaurants since the food scene wasn't my main concern.  That being said, my friend and I strolled up and down Hanover looking for a place to eat Saturday night.  Because it was late we hurried into the first restaurant that would seat us, \\"Dolce Vita,\\" the worst find on the trip.

The tiny kitchen intertwined with the handful of dining tables was fantastic.  We got to eat there the next day for lunch.  First of all, I hate expectations; you get your hopes up and are rarely met.  This was one of the few occasions where they were met.  The black pasta was fresh and tender and did not needed much to it.  The calamari (small) was portioned perfectly, lightly fried so you could really taste how fresh the octopus is and again did not needed much to it but a little bit of lemon. The first hint that calamari would be a good appetizer was that octopus is spread out through out the menu, calamari balls, the Aglio Olio, so stick with an octopus dish, at least on your first visit, its not to be missed.  \\n\\nTo top it off the chef was great.  Friendly, definitely not overly friendly, something that tends to be a pet peeve of fine, and he took our order from inside the kitchen, which I think is great.

I love their char-broiled Chicken vermicelli with egg rolls (#37).\\n\\nWhat I love about it, is the vermicelli is not soupy, but is al dente. The vegetables are fresh, the chicken is glazed with a subtle (very tasty - not over powering) teriyaki, and the fish sauce is light, sweet, and balanced in flavor. I would love to get the recipe, so I could make it at home.\\n\\nUnless you're not a fan of egg rolls, you've got to try their egg rolls! They are flavorful, hearty, and have crispy outer edges.  \\n\\nThe tea is excellent. It is served loose leaf, not in a tea bag. An added bonus is that it is served steeping in a tea pot. So, you can enjoy your tea throughout your meal or share it with friends. \\n\\nThe service is friendly. You are seated promptly and the food is served quickly. The busiest time seems to be during the lunch hour. It's OK for groups (except during lunch hour). Pho Hoang is very affordable -- $5.75 to $6.50 for vermicelli & egg rolls. They also have carry out. Every time I've stopped in for a take-out order, my food is ready in about 5 minutes. The down side is that they are cash only. But, they've got you covered... they've got an ATM on site. \\n\\nI've brought friends there as well... and they've enjoyed it just as much!   This place is definitely on my top five.

Being from hawaii and half vietnamese I know what this food should taste like.  But it is the mainland so i wasnt expecting much.  \\n\\nTo start off our server was rude and didnt answer our questions directly so we were left in the dark when it came to the menu.  Next came the water, it tasted as if they recycled the water they use to clean the rice and serve it as perfectly normal drinking water.  It looks alright, but taste very odd.  We finally ordered and had no idea what to expect to come out of the kitchen. First came the curry soup, immediately my friend noticed a hair, that clearly didnt belong to her, laying on the noodles and she pulled it out and was quiet about it. Not only was there a hair in it but the entire dish lacked flavor and was not worth the money we spent. I had ordered the \\"pok pok special\\" and i thought it would be a safe bet.  I started eating their version of a green papaya salad.  It tasted nothing like a normal green papaya salad.  They added string beans and tomatoes to it which didnt fit with the dish.  They used the small dried shrimp instead of regular whole shrimp and were missing the pork.  I moved onto my chicken which really wasnt that bad at all until i fished up a hair out of the sauce.  I notified a server and she said she'll grab the manager.  Our original server came back and said he will bring out a new dish and jokingly asking for the hair as proof  and said he'll \\"find the culprit\\". They brought out the new dish and i just did not want to eat it so i just waited for everyone else to finish their food.  \\n\\nOverall  it was one of the worst experiences ever and all their food was bland or too spicy to have flavor.

You know that part that starts with DQ, passes through Thomas Haas up to Moderne. However, for me, sometimes being healthy includes indulging in the pleasures of life like those Thomas Haas chocolates and cakes, DQ ice cream, Salt's wine and cheese collection, and of course Moderne's delicious steak burger, large serving of fries, vanilla milk shakes with garnished whip cream and cherry on top and those sodas with crushed ice. Those things may not keep my body healthy but it keeps my mind happy and healthy. \\n\\nI consider the steak burger of Moderne Burger one of Vancouver's best tasting burgers. Haven't had burgers that tasted this good since Daniel Boulud left Vancouver a year after the Winter Olympics. Even MB's thick Salmon Burger which my friend had was quite good. And yes, the serving of fries is really for two people. Plus, the milk shakes are awesome. I get the vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry to go with my burger on my cheat days as in diet-wise. \\n\\nThis place turns back the clock, Johnny Hates Jazz-style,  to the \\" Grease \\" Frankie Valli era. Actually this is the best place to bring your friends for pre-show dinner of the \\" Grease \\" Broadway Musical if they're on the road in Vancouver since its already close post-show. I know they do close early and also on Sundays and Holidays but the vibe of this place and the service is really super when the owners are there. They make sure that you have a wonderful experience upon entering the Grease era. Even grease will drop once you bite your steak burger. \\n\\nThey seem to have a good following in the neighborhood but another thing going for them is their early closing times as well.

Here's why:  \\n\\n1) ICOB has arguably the best cocktails and bartenders in town. They can execute the classics flawlessly, showcase inventive and complex drinks on the menu, and can improvise and experiment off-menu like few others. Even insufferable cocktail snobs will find ICOB beyond reproach.   \\n\\n2) They commit equal dedication to the food.  The raw bar is diverse and expertly prepared. The bread & butter, often overlooked other places if you ask me, is awesome - I forget exactly but it's honey chipotle butter or something wild. The entrees we've had have all showcased the quality seafood front-and-center, yet aren't afraid to bring bold and intricate preparations. I also highly recommend the bar menu food. One time we got the lobster roll sliders and I can't imagine anyone not being a fan.  \\n\\n3) I really like the atmosphere and staff.  This is a seriously nice place but it's the polar opposite of old, stuffy New England. The design is crisp and modern without trying desperately hard to be cool. I also like the TV policy where if there's a huge game they'll put it on but otherwise it's tucked away behind a cabinet.  I'll also note here that ICOB is a much better space to enjoy cocktails than Eastern Standard. I can't count the number of times I've seen great drinks spilled at ES due to the comically narrow bar area.  Here, you don't have to be on high alert for people hip checking you while desperately trying to steady your aviation. \\n\\nIn short, I had really high hopes for ICOB when it opened and for once a place delivered and exceeded the hype."},{"name":"Toichi Ichiban Japanese Cuisine","address":"5 Kendall St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"New japanese-Korean restaurant in Brookline.

It has also grown so much over the past year and a half. \\n2. The salon is NICE. I have had several dramatic experiences with salons - I had one salon tell me, no, they couldn't do a wash and blow dry if my hair wasn't permed, true story - and I would usually end up in awful places in sketchy neighborhoods. Blessing's salon is a breath of fresh air, nicely decorated, pretty, and incredibly relaxing. \\n3. She is always prompt, and I've never had to wait around waiting to get my hair shampooed, or waiting between a shampoo and style. I really respect the fact that she does not double-book because it would be so easy for her to do this. \\n4. Finally, Blessing is amazing. She is a great person inside and out, and she takes a genuine interest in her clients as people. \\n\\nI tried to hide the \\"Blessing\\" so I could keep her all to myself, but then she got featured for Best Weave in Boston - so the secret is out. I already can't get same or next day appointments anymore, and with more Yelp reviews so I likely won't be able to get same week appointments either. But that's okay - she deserves it, and I'm just going to have to be more organized in the New Year and plan longer ahead."},{"name":"Casa B Tapas and Cocktail & Rum Bar","address":"253 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I can't even deal with how good this place is. the tapas are creative and delicious. so many wonderful and interesting flavors. there were 2 of us and we did well with 4 plates between us. bread pudding for dessert.

I am generally not a fan of cake donuts, but these are so fresh and moist, subtly spiced and topped with gooey, melty icing, they're just too hard to refuse! They are better than Pips I think. Best cake donuts in town to my knowledge. \\n\\nTheir coffee is by no means anything special but their chai latte a notable contender. WiFi isn't the best either.

Yes it's small and a bit overpriced but wow, it's got some awesome taste and texture to it.  I'd highly recommend it.\\n\\nAlso, don't forget to try their spicy cheese if you like spicy food.  Unlike most fast food it's actually a bit hot which makes it a nice change of pace.  And don't be afraid to pull some cheese off the hot dog or spaghetti if it really makes your arteries clog just looking at it.

It is a light fluffy bun with braised pork belly, peanuts, cilantro, pickled relish and a chili sauce. That pork belly was so tender it just melted in my mouth. The salt and pepper chicken reminded you of chicken nuggets Texas style with all of those slices of Jalapenos. They were so good I just ignored the fact that Jalapenos always upset my stomach. Some things are worth the pain. \\n\\nTheir version of hot and sour soup was more like a version of ginger lemongrass soup. I thought it was one of the best soups I have tried but it was not hot and sour at all. The Mi Fen Cho or Taiwanese noodles with shredded pork, was delicious. The mushrooms, fungi combination they used really set it off nicely and I really enjoyed the flavor of the cilantro.

When reading the description, I knew right away what kind of flavors I would be expecting as it sounded extremely familiar to kapoon. This dish is the same concept as kapoon with beef as an option. However, the noodles are different. I personally prefer the vermicelli noodles than the noodles they serve the dish with. The chicken wings had a good kick to them. A bit salty, but that's why it has fish sauce as part of it's name because fish sauce is salty. I definitely recommend eating these with rice. The chicken wings and soup were $15.50 each. \\n\\nOverall, I thought both dishes were great in flavors, but for the Khao Soi, I thought it was a bit overpriced.

The bread at flying Falafel is a wider style of bread that left too much bread on the side portion (I don't know if this makes sense or not) with all the filling close to the edge. \\n\\nCame with three perfectly fried oysters, mayo, ketchup, and lettuce."},{"name":"Golden Lotus Chinese Restaurant","address":"8365 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Êç¢Âé®Â∏àÂ•ΩÈïøÊó∂Èó¥Ôºå‰ª•ÂâçÊòØÊàë‰ª¨ÂæàÂñúÊ¨¢ÂéªÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÁé∞Âú®ÁöÑËèúÂÖ®ÈÉΩÂèòÂæóÂæàÈöæÂêÉÔºåÂ∏åÊúõËÄÅÊùøËÉΩÊÑèËØÜÂà∞Âç±Êú∫ÔºÅËøôÂπ≤ÁÇíÁâõÊ≤≥ÁÆÄÁõ¥Êó†Ê≥ïÂÖ•Âè£‰ª•ÂâçÂÅöÁöÑÂ§öÂ•ΩÂïäÔºåËøòÊúâËøôËæ£Ê§íÊ≤π‰ª•ÂâçÁöÑÂæàÂ•ΩÂæàÊñ∞ÔøΩ?Áé∞Âú®ÂèòÊàê‰∫ÜËæ£Ê§íÊ≥•ÔºåÂ§±ÊúõÔºÅ"},{"name":"Suzette Creperie","address":"3342 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Looking for a place to have lunch while my cat was undergoing a procedure at the nearby vet's.\\n\\nDriving along Belmont, I noticed Suzette and its charming facade \\"spoke\\" to me.\\n\\nWell worth the visit.  \\n\\nThe crepes are buckwheat flour just like main course ones in France, and their size is similar to the French ones, too.

The kale salad was so good you forget how healthy it is. \\n\\nMy date got the garden scramble and was nice enough to give me a bite of what she called \\"veggie deliciousness\\". She was right. To top it all off the banana almond smoothie I got was the best smoothie I have ever had. All this goodness and afterwards you feel energized and like patting yourself on the back for living such a healthy lifestyle. 5 stars."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If I rate by the authenticity of Basic Ramen, It is an average.  It is not bad, but not too good either.  Over all ramen restaurants in Portland taste all \\"modified\\" to their own ways from the very basic ramen, and this is one of those place.

Pokin' awesome. My second visit here and it was better than the first. We were smart to show up for Sunday lunch as it was easy to get in without a wait. The chicken wings, roasted chicken, porkbelly curry, shrimp vermicelli and beef curry noodle soup were all spectacular.  (I'm giving American terminology here as I wouldn't be able to remember the actual dish's native name on the menu!) ask your waiter to order you the top items and you'll be fine.

Service was friendly, though clearly staff are still figuring things out. Manager brought our food and went back for forgotten fries. Generally a happy setting. The buns are baked on the premises, and they make sure the fresh bread oven exhaust wafts that pleasant scent right across the entryway. \\n\\nThe turkey burger has that overly-ground sandy texture that's unpleasant and frankly makes me wonder why they pulverize it so much. They also use the Morningstar black bean patties for the veggie burger, and they always fall apart where the standard patty from MS does not. We can't speak about the cow burgers, and honestly doubt I'll return to find out. The potato fries were merely adequate.\\n\\nNothing is marketed as natural or local. They store window says \\"locally operated\\" but this is meaningless except for restaurants where everyone is bussed in for the day. In other words it's not even \\"locally owned\\". \\n\\nWith if you have a choice when you're in a burger mood, try B.

To this place with veggies means peas that looked like raisins and carrots obviously canned.  Fried rice was pale and didn't taste fried.  Came out first with rubbery old chicken and something that had the texture of tuna.  Wife had Ramen delivered much later with much better chicken tasted freshly grilled.  Sauce containers so grimy I didn't want to touch them and water glass was greasy.  Pot stickers had dry pieces.  If we were not really really hungry wouldn't have  even tried to choke it down.

I spent a week in Atlanta last month, and was definitely exited to get some good southern barbeque once again. This is something that Denver just doesn't do well. So, when lunchtime rolled around I pulled out my phone and checked out nearby places on my trusty Yelp app... and Yelpers, you didn't let me down! \\n\\nOur group of eight was seated quickly (though even at lunch they asked if we had a reservation), and began pouring over that menu. First, don't rule this place out if you've got a vegetarian in your group. The vegetarian options were plentiful, and many looked great even by a carnivore's standards. But, I'm here for the meat. \\n\\nI opted for the rib sandwich, and holy crap... it was one of the best BBQ sandwiches I've ever had. For my side, I went with the creamed corn which was also very good. \\n\\nTo top it all off, our server split our checks with no problem and got us on our way quickly.
