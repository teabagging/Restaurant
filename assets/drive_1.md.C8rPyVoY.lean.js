I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat.

They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \\n\\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\\n\\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\\n\\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\\n\\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly.

You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\\n\\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\\n\\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\\n\\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\\n\\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\\n\\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.

My party of four did the tasting menu which consisted of 1. Sunchoke caramelized egg the egg was not to dry or wet but rather cooked to perfection. The  carmel was a nice compliment to the creaminess  of the egg.  2. Pig skin noodles with shrimp hot sauce though the sauce was not too hot which I loved. 3. Shiitake pasta with scrambled eggs and grilled broccoli, I generally do not like mushrooms but this was good as the whole dish   complemented one another in that the mushroom state was subtle. 4. Poached red snapper with koji butter and brussels sprouts again i normally dislike Brussels sprouts but the butter made it sweet and savory all in one bite. The fish was perfectly cooked. 5. Parsley croissant with bone marrow. the crust was perfectly  flaked and you could drink the marrow by itself it was so good. 6. Blackened Octopus, pork fired rice and cabbage yogurt. It was a beautiful char but the cabbage taste was a bit over whelming it took away from the seared taste and rice. 7. Fried Chicken smoked fish and caramelized pickles. Good mix of sweet and sour the breading on the chicken held in the state for a lasting after taste the lingered on the tongue. 8. Duck with salt roasted roots. A little to fatty and salty. 9 Cider vinegar pie apple, way to bitter. 9. Sunchoke crusted sunflower with meyer lemon. This was okay a bit sour. 10. A box of four homemade  chocolates perfection in a box. We forwent the paring and yet in the end spent just as much so I'd suggest the paring.

The waitresses were nice, though.  \\n\\nI had the special: apple-walnut crunchy french toast with a side of sausage.  That French toast was out-of-this-world yummy.  The crunch came from what looked like granola mixed with crushed corn flakes.  They were finished with fried apples and walnuts and powdered sugar.  I thought the powdered sugar was completely unnecessary and was disappointed when I discovered that this delicious French toast had been deep fried (by the dead giveaway of a fry hidden underneath one of the slices).  However, the taste more than made up for its shortcomings in execution--I'm salivating thinking about it right now.  It was sweet, crunchy, and perfectly seasoned.  The sausages were also great--big, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  The bf had a corned beef hash plate with eggs and homefries.  He enjoyed his breakfast, but wasn't raving.  He thought my French toast was good, but too sweet for him.  I stole some of his homefries and thought they were good but not great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order them.  The bill was around $20, which I think is kinda high for a diner, but certainly not absurd.\\n\\nSo, if I'm in the neighborhood and I don't have to battle hungover undergrads for a seat, I would totally come back for that French toast.  Otherwise, I don't find this place very worthy of the hype."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I shall give 3.5 stars.

But then I heard that they were shutting down for a few to redecorate. So is it worth it to review it, to describe the characteristics of a business when it may come out as something different? Probably not. But I will anyways, lets call this a before-and-after, a kind of Yelpers caf√© version of This Old House but with a catch--I'm skeptical that the new version will be better than the old; I fear that they will do away with what makes the place charming for the ephemeral gloss of sterile corporatism. \\n\\nThis Cup Of Joe shares an affinity with the Clintonville version in that it is in a old building that jives with its vintage d√©cor. The outer fa√ßade is almost neo-classic, with its foo-roman columns and stucco paint. Inside the furniture has a classic 1930s feel, the chairs are comfortable to sit. It is the perfect place to read, and that makes it a soulmate to its neighbor, the Bookloft. It has plenty of space and has more sofas than a Starbucks usually has, Near the bar, there is a nicely toned bookshelf with some interesting selections of local concern. COJ always has a huge selection of free newspaper available: Alive, neighborhood rags, LGBT themed circulars, and art monthlies fill its fixtures. For those now addicted to Ipads, COJ has free Wi-Fi. \\n\\nAs with the Clintonville COJ, this one has a very cool, fun, and open clientele. I have met many friend from joining conversation here, have made a few dates, and have enjoyed countless more conversations that span from high philosophic ideas to low, laughable humor. Those memories and the people I've met here makes this place endearing. \\n\\nCup of Joe can serves a fine latte. The coffee is bought from Grandview's Staufs and is fresh and aromatic. Although, and this is the same at all COJ, you don't always get a quality drink. Consistency is lacking IMHO. Although I'd say that most of the time their Mocha (the latte I order the most) is good, once in awhile I do get a watered down drink. This is probably the biggest mark against what is otherwise a nice Caf√©. \\n\\nNow my fear is that they plan to turn this special, classic place into more like the Short North COJ/Mojo Lounge--which I feel doesn't have the charm of the GVs, where the lounge is separated from the Caf√©.  I hope not. I will return after renovations are complete and do a re-review. I hope they retain some of that classic feel. I hope they don't make it like the Short North store.

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\\n\\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\\n\\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\\n\\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\\n\\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\\n\\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.

After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.  \\n\\nIt started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door.  Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  That's right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didn't offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.\\n\\nWhen our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, \\"oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  I'm looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.\\"   I said, \\"well, that's unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?\\"  She said, \\"I'll see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?\\"  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?\\n\\nWe ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.\\n\\nWe ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but we're not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato souffl√© (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. \\n\\nWhen the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, \\"everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, \\"No.  Can you tell me what's on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?\\" Her response was, \\"It's a sweet potato souffl√©, I can get you whipped cream.\\"  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didn't ask if she could get me anything else and didn't ask if we would like anything else to drink.\\n\\nThe food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.

Their brand- it's evident in the charming truck itself, well dressed vintage-themed staff, creative names for cupcakes, etc. that thought is put into each detail of this business. Kudos to Yum Yum for attention to detail, despite the mass they serve! \\n\\n2. The cupcakes themselves- OUTSTANDING is an understatement. Each flavor takes on a unique personality. The cake is always moist, and but never heavy. The cupcakes are always fresh, and it's clear that they weren't frozen. I love the surprises inside- for example, tonight, the banana slice inside the cupcake, on top of the graham cracker bottom, or the Oreo baked into the bottom of the cookies 'n cream cupcake- again, never lacking on detail. The \\"Pastry Chef\\" who posted must be a competitor or have bad taste... because I've never had a bad experience! I can also vouche for them because I've picked up orders from their SoDo bakery, taken a tour, and not seen a single box/mix for their cakes! \\n\\n3. The customer service- not to harp, but I've been a fan for about a year. Since then, I've hosted parties serving their product, and they always (no matter what day/time) accommodate the order. They do a great job of keeping their lines go quickly, and go as far to hand out menus to expidite the process at bigger food truck events. I'll go on to say that I'm usually pretty cheap about what I spend money on, however, I can justify getting what I'm paying for with their quality and excellent service. I see them at many events, and all of their staff maintain a high level of standards. \\n\\nSo, I'm a Yum Yum super-fan. And they've earned my business! My personal favorite picks are Dom Berrignon (moist strawberry cake, champagne buttercream), smores (graham cracker crust, rich choc cake, perfect marshmellow cream-- amazing textures!), and Cookies Got Creamed (like I said, Oreo baked at the bottom... fab!). \\n\\nDon't miss out on Yum Yum.

Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check.

I believe that every restaurant (at least in Orlando) should have convenient parking or at least a valet attendant. \\n\\nThat wait was not too long (~30 min), but that's not saying much since the food wasn't great. I did not find the wait time to be worth the price of the meal. I guess I had higher expectations based on the all the rave and stellar reviews that I read online. Moreover, I did not think John Rivers, owner of the successful 4R Smokehouse, would launch such a less than mediocre restaurant. I loved the atmosphere and \\"southern affair\\" theme. The establishment was clean and orderly (as every new restaurant should be) and the employees were courteous and helpful with menu suggestions. \\n\\nI went during lunchtime and ordered the \\"Giant Chicken Tenders -- 2 pc. Generous Plate\\" with three fixings. For my fixings, I ordered the coleslaw, macaroni & cheese, and fried okra. I guess they threw in what they call their \\"cornbread\\" on the side (see #5 below). \\n\\nJust like at 4R, I love the convenience of washing my hands at the sink near the soda fountain and tea just before I eat my meal; however, there were a few problems. For one, they did NOT have soap available because their soap dispenser supposedly broke. When I asked the employee where I could find soap (with my hands already drenched), the individual not only looked at me as if she had never heard of washing your hands with soap, but she was not able to locate soap for me to wash my hands. Secondly, there were no paper towels in sight to dry my hands. Need I state the conspicuous implications of public health concerns or unsanitary practices? \\n\\nThoughts on individual menu items:\\n\\n1. The \\"giant\\" tenders were anything but giant. They were 2 petite pieces of lukewarm, soggy chicken tenders that I did not finish eating. Had the chicken tenders been temperature hot and crispy, I believe they would have been good because they were dredged in a peppery batter (I love pepper!). \\n\\n2. The coleslaw wasn't bad, but nothing really remarkable. It was your conventional coleslaw that you can pretty much find anywhere. \\n\\n3. The fried okra was barely battered, and also cold. I greatly prefer the fried okra that is served at 4R (it's delicious). \\n\\n4. The white cheddar macaroni and cheese was my favorite item that I consumed that afternoon. It wasn't temperature hot either, but it was good nonetheless. I loved the fried onion crisps on top! I would recommend the macaroni to those of you wanting to try something different. \\n\\n5. Last but not least, the \\"cornbread\\". I place this menu item in quotations because what they serve is NOT cornbread. Although John Rivers doesn't have the best cornbread reputation (the 4R's rendition isn't great), this abysmal piece of bread should be discontinued and removed from the menu entirely. Furthermore, I suggest if they would like to serve cornbread, they should consult with Boston Market and seek out recipe advice (or divine intervention).  \\n\\n6. For my beverage I got freshly brewed iced tea. I love the tea that is brewed at both 4Rivers and The Coop (I presume it is the same tea). It's delicious and I love their ice! Drinking tea with my meals is a ritual and I consider myself a tea connoisseur. \\n\\n7. For dessert I ordered the fried hand pie (apple). This was good, but it wasn't great. I think the pies would be acceptable if they were at least served warm.\\n\\nOverall, my experience was lackluster and mediocre at best. I think that the place has a lot of potential and I hope that John Rivers can assimilate the constructive feedback and make the appropriate changes. As per the quality and value of the food, the place is reminiscent of my high school cafeteria food and did not appease my palette.  I will not be running back to The Coop.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I recommend you try the place for yourself and form your own personal opinions."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"5043 Tuttle Crossing Blvd, Ste 205","city":"Dublin","stars":"3","text":"The positive: large restaurant right in the Tuttle Crossing mall.

Appetizer was delivered and still no order was taken. We had to wait an additional 5 minutes to eat our appetizer because she never even brought us napkins or silverware. We had to flag down a different server and ask her to get our server so we could get utensils. \\nWhen she finally brought them she took our food order. \\nThen we waited...and waited.... and waited.... 45 minutes before our food arrived.

Today I went to Hooters for lunch.  There were at least 15-20 people of Mexican decent that walked in to be seated.  I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat/serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn't get a good tip because they were Mexicans.  The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,.

I no longer eat here."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A friend of mine gave me the \\"newbie's tour\\" of Desta last night.  Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I've killed a lot of brain cells since then.\\n\\nMy friend recommended the Beef (Tenderloin) Tibs with Shiro and the Vegetarian Combo.  She also explained to me that while a lot of Ethiopian food is very heavy on the sauce, Desta uses a lighter amount of sauce.  They say that the reason for that is that they're proud of their ingredients.  I can see why, because everything was very good.\\n\\nIf you ask to share your food between the members of your party, all the food will come out on one huge plate together.  This allows you to eat \\"family style\\" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach isn't so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you're eating with your hands and sharing food.\\n\\nThe Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I'm a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what \\"perfect\\" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it's unlikely that I'd ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. \\n\\nThe Vegetarian Platter was great, too.  I wasn't sure of exactly what items I was eating, so I came home and looked at the menu.  After I looked at the menu, I'm still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that aren't listed on the menu and vice versa.  (Not that I mind not knowing what I'm eating, because I eat Korean food pretty often now that I live out in BFE and I usually only know what about 30% of the banchan items are.)\\n\\nAnyway, everything on the veggie plate was good (except that my friend and I did not try the halved fresh jalapeno with tomatoes because neither of us wanted that much fresh jalapeno).  Some items I remember trying were the collard green stew, the split pea stew, more shiro, a beet and potato salad, and a yellow-tinted cabbage dish.  \\n\\nThere was also a salad of lettuce and tomatoes and a red paste which I loved and think it might have been vegetarian fir fir.  Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  \\n\\nMy favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I didn't like.  All of the items were served over more injera.  I guess I should have read the review earlier that mentioned that you are supposed to eat that injera too because it's yummy and has soaked up all the flavors.  Oops.\\n\\n(Yeah, in retrospect that seems like common sense.  But my friend was minimizing her bread consumption and my week at work has been rough.  I don't think my brain is functioning at full capacity anymore.)\\n\\nWith all the food we ordered, our total check only came to around 24 bucks.  Not too bad for the opportunity to try a million and one items (well, maybe more like 10 items).  I let satiated but not stuffed, and looking forward to trying some more things the next time I eat at an Ethiopian restaurant.\\n\\nMy experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I'm not giving a full five stars is that I don't feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.\\n\\nOh, and on our way out of the restaurant, we noticed that Desta has a drive thru.  Drive-thru Ethiopian cuisine?  Win."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty darn good brisket!

When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \\n\\nPros:\\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.

Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\\n\\nCons:\\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.

Everyone's favorite WeatherMan/Yelp Reviewer  has come out of retirement.\\n\\nEnough about me, lets talk about the Coop!\\n\\nIf you are familiar with the Coop, please proceed to skip to the next paragraph.  For those new or visiting the area, the Coop restaurant is all about Southern fare.   The Coop is the second concept restaurant created by local BBQ chef, John Rivers.  If you have never been to 4 Rivers (4R), then please stop reading (no don't) and head over there as well! \\n\\nBefore I talk about the food, lets discuss some important details...\\n\\n1.) Location - The Coop is nestled in the heart of Winter Park.  A few blocks down you will find Park Ave that is a great place to take a leisurely stroll after consuming some goodness at the Coop.\\n\\n2.) Decor & Interior - Close your eyes and try to imagine what your grandmother's kitchen would look like if she lived in the south.  Yup the Coop is like that but bigger.  For those that struggled with this exercise, the interior has a decent dining area filled with antique (and mismatching) furniture to give it that southern feel.  Outside they have a patio area that has your standard park benches.  However, the Christmas style lighting sets the mood if you are ever dining at night\\n\\n3.) Ordering Your Food - Unlike most sit down restaurants, the Coop will whisk you back to your elementary school days with its cafeteria style setup.  As soon as you walk in, pick up a menu and drool over what you will order once it is your turn in line.  If you are eating breakfast, your meals are made and brought to your table.  Lunch & dinner is served to you cafeteria style. \\n\\n4.) Random Thoughts - Don't be discouraged by the crowds.  The lines usually move quickly.  Can't find a spot in their lot? Check out the extra parking they have across the street.  Check out their merch!  I bought one of their t-shirts with the squawking chicken on it. \\n\\nAnd now the moment you have all been waiting for.... my review of the food! \\n\\nDinner....\\n\\nBawk bawk bawk... The Coop's staple is their fried chicken.  So when in Rome right?  The chicken was good.  Don't get me wrong, I am spoiled because I  grew up in a family that made some killer fried chicken.  The sides were fantastic!  You can definitely see the 4 Rivers influence in their sides.   I am particularly fond of their mac n' cheese, biscuits, and the corn!  My first dinner experience at the Coop was delicious and is worth trying on your own.  I do have the itch to go back and try their meatloaf!\\n\\nBreakfast....\\n\\nOh me. Oh my!  These are the first words that come to mind when I think about the Coop's breakfast.  This is truly a breakfast gem in the Winter Park area.  I have experienced their breakfast menu twice in a matter of two weeks.  My first experience consisted of your basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, and potatoes.  I also threw in an order of their brioche french toast.  My meal was amazing.  They have some bangin' (do the kids still say that?) breakfast potatoes and french toast.  My second experience, I made my own omelet and complimented it with a biscuit, breakfast potatoes, and grits.  My mouth went to breakfast heaven!  Next time I go, you can bet on me ordering some of their cinnamon roll french toast and their bananas foster pancakes.\\n\\nWeatherMan Predicts: 95% chance of precipitation (or drool).  90% chance that you are not sitting in the same chair as your companions. 50% chance of not having enough syrup on the table for your mouthwatering pancakes or french toast.  30% chance that you will buy their awesome merchandise.  5% chance of you leaving still hungry! 100% chance of enjoying the southern hospitality at the Coop!"},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I hate it when people rate places based on their experiences with a competitor or like business.

A brief history is important.  When the restaurant first opened, it had a variety of reasonably priced comfort food items on the menu.  (My favorite was the salmon with bowtie pasta and vodka sauce.)  And it had a really nice wine by the glass list. And, it played soft selections of Sinatra and other pieces of the kind you hear on the \\"Singers and Standards\\" channel on the cable.  A little later, they built out the back into a patio, and successfully screened it from the Kroger loading dock next door so that it made for a delightful outside experience on summer nights. (That grocery store closed long ago, so no more problems there.)  It was a perfect spot for the Brookhaven/Club neighborhood around it.  Then two bad things happened, and then a third.  First, the restaurant got too full of itself and it's wine selection, and kept upping the wine selection until a glass of wine was in the $18 to $25 range -- really a non-starter for a restaurant that by that time had seats in the booths that were beginning to fail.  Then they changed chefs (I presume) because the food quality went down.  And later, worst of all, they changed the music to loud, contemporary vocals, which I find extremely annoying during dinner.  \\n\\nSo I stayed away, for several years.  Having just returned -- twice now in the past couple of months, I was pleased with the new menu that contains a nice variety of dishes.  The several I have tried have all been good.  And, equally important, they brought the prices of the wines by the glass back down to a reasonable level.  The music on the inside was still too loud and annoying for my taste, but fortunately on the patio it was quieter and very pleasant.

I half expected a ray of light to shine down from the sky.\\n\\nWe walked in and were greeted by a staff member behind the counter who turned out to be one of the owners. We had a pleasant chat about how the first week had gone and decided on a couple espresso drinks and a slice of apple pie. While we waited, my friend perused some of the local art pieces in their floor displays and ended up getting a print to send to her mother.\\n\\nThe layout has changed a few times, but it's basically a bunch of 2-4 top tables of various types and one large 8-top for larger groups. There are also four lounge chairs around a small table near the back. They kept the beams and part of one original brick wall exposed, and the whole place is open and feels like a relaxed coffee shop should.\\n\\nThe latte I got was as good as I expected from a place like this: better than the chains, not quite as good as local standouts. They avoided the only thing that would really turn me off: oversweetening. After stirring, the flavor of the espresso was still at the fore, and the milk was frothed pretty well (and has gotten better in subsequent visits).\\n\\nThe first thing that struck me about the pie was how big it was. We split it, and I still felt like I got a good late-night dessert. The apple slices were large and had just a little crispness in them. The filling tended more toward cinnamon/sugar than butter and was quite good. The crust wasn't the most flavorful, but since I rarely order dessert at restaurants, I'm a bit spoiled by mostly having homemade versions.\\n\\nI will continue to support this place for providing a locally-owned, badly-needed option for late-night coffee drinkers who also want a sweet snack every once in a while."},{"name":"Matchstick Coffee Roasters","address":"639 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place is uppity hipster heaven.

God forbid I don't walk in there with my moleskin notebook alongside my oak+fort jeans and blundstone boots. \\nFrom the ridiculous amount they charge for any drinks to the rude holier-than-thou attitude every location and its staff emanates, there is little to like about this instagrammer's paradise. \\nI told myself that the second I found a butter croissant to rival that of Paris, I'd never go back and I tell you I'm all the better for it. 1) A better butter croissant does in fact exist here in Van and 2) I will survive without the \\"uggh\\" that follows any request I make from Matchstick staff."},{"name":"PDX Sliders","address":"3111 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"In my opinion this might be the best burger joint in Portland. Now its not necessarily a burger place, but miniature burger place. But the variety is amazing! So instead of filling up on burger, you can have a couple different kinds and have a multi orgasmic mouth experience! Now don't get me wrong, you can also order any normal size burger here too... but then it's like any other place. Nah, go for the sliders!\\n\\nWhen my wife and I visited the other day we ordered The Hawthorn each, she got a Chicken one and I got a Philly. Now the hawthorn was great, weird combo of goat cheese and preserves. Mouth orgasm! Yum. Her chicken one was tastey, but not a good pairing with the hawthorns sweatness. Same with the philly. It was good, but not well paired. Next time we will either get sweet and sweet or savory only. We also shared the fries. I'm really picky about fries. I like them crispy, not soggy. I like them shoe string size and i like them hot. So these fries hit all of my req, they were perfect. Plus they were seasoned with garlic.\\n\\nI am a wheelchair user, and getting into this place is easy, flat and tables are large enough to accommodate me. Also the tables are tall enough to park under. The staff were knowledgeable about the products and pleasant to speak to.\\n\\nThis place does have beer on tap but I didn't try any.

I was seated relatively quickly after, and servers were pleasant.  I went with the Veggie platter and a salad.  Adding the salad was a mistake.  They brought the salad first,  which ended up delaying the main veggie platter especially long.  They even brought the check in between!  I probably had about 50 calories to start, so was a little annoyed.\\n\\nThe veggie platter itself was very good, and different from your usual Ethiopian fare.  I found it a little spicier than usual, which was a plus.  They have some additional cold dishes including beets, which were a strong point.\\n\\nTheir injera is very pleasing to the Ethiopian neophyte, since it is soft and spongey and cut with wheat, so with less teff = less sourness.  That said, the gluten content goes up.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the ambiance, which was large, hipster, and fun.  They're very busy with good reason, the food is delicious an affordably priced.

This isn't really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you can't really have groups come eat here, I'd consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain \\"bros before hoes\\" to your wife before you ditch the bitch?\\n\\nOnce you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. \\nThe shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and you're left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. \\n\\nIf you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.\\n\\nThe fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if you're feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If you're on a budget go to \\nP.

The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. \\nThere is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! \\nWe both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!\\nThey have it decorated nicely and it's very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly.

Wonton shell and spicy mayo/avocado with a little lime was a nice combo. Just NO SEASONING and lacked flavor. I was dying just for a little touch of ponzu or something just to bring everything together.\\n\\nNative Lobster roll - Great lobster with generous portions. Brioche roll was nice. Again, a lack of SEASONING and just a bit bland\\n\\nShaved Prime Steak Sandwich- Nice quality prime rib shavings. Horseradish sauce is more creamy and very mild. Its juicy so it soaks up in the bread. Again, a bit bland like everything else. I noticed their picture puts gravy on the side but I think mine was pour over the sandwich. \\n\\nFritas- Though I complain that everything was under salted and I thought this was OVER salted than most fries. Otherwise, a good lunch frita. Individual ketchup, pretty cool\\n\\nVerdict 2 stars: I wouldn't be so picky if the prices weren't SO HIGH. Maybe the public has a blander palate but I think this is basic execution to properly season dishes.

She offered to call the manager.  We moved to a table after that so I don't know what happen with it.  I definitely  wouldn't come here for dinner.

After we got a table the same blonde again,  asked us to move (without knowing we had permission from the hostess and waitress) on one hand I know she was just doing her job, but I felt like she should have asked her coworkers first, or even us before ordering us to move. It wasn't a big deal or anything, and after we told her she just said ok, so I know she wasn't trying to be rude.

I wanted to really like this place...I REALLY did. I'd been there before at the tail end of a dinner for some wine, but never had the food...so here was my opportunity.\\n\\n*For those who may not know, everything at Navarre is served a la carte, tapas style, blah blah blah. You sit down at your table (a very nice rustic oak? I might add) & are given a menu & a marker. They typically have a theme (It is Austrian right now) & a list of their regular dishes as well. You proceed to check off which dishes you would like to order in either a small plate or large plate. (MOST are available this way)\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: You walk in passing a wall of \\"things\\" pickling in jars into what feels like John Taboada's pantry. The dining rooms has sleek concrete floors, wooden tables, & tableware that has a nice vintagey-euro feel to it. Big windows on the wall facing 28th. Overall, HELLA charming.\\n\\nFOOD: A lot of varying tastes in our group but we ordered: Bread, Grassy Olive Oil, Spanish Cheese Plate, Sweet & Sour Lentils, Mustard Carrots, Crab Cakes, Apple Horseradish Chop, & Beer Stewed Pork. Everything was pretty tasty. The Crab Cakes were a highlight but a little different than what East Coasters might be used to. The chop & pork were super tender & the lentils & carrots had a nice freshness to them. We topped it off with a slice of their red velvet cake which we polished off in no time.\\n\\nSERVICE: This is the part that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. There were about 2 other tables at the time & some gals munching at the bar...yet it seemed like a hassle to even get some water. Ordering dessert was even worse...as I think she forgot about us, but oh...she had just been chatting with her friends at the bar for quite a bit until she finally came over. On the bright side, she did give us good recommendations on what was good for the day, & upon leaving the chef (John?) took a step out & thanked us for coming. Little things like that are always a nice touch IMO.\\n\\nBeing named as \\"Restaurant Of The Year\\" the other year...I wanted to really like this place.

Well, the place wasn't as independent as I was hoping. Still a fair commercial feel going on inside complete with ‚Ñ¢s on the menu. Corporate places can get the theme down and polished but sometimes lack in authenticity once the place is running.\\n\\nThe place is kind of like a cross between Quisnos and Jimmy Johns. The sandwiches are very meat-centric. The feel of the place is like they were trying for a bit of an east coast vibe but the only part they really got to was the random yelling of words by the staff.\\n\\nI get to the line, browse through the quite large bottled beverage selection to see all the typical mass-produced overly sugary selections. Passed on the beverages. Moved passed to order my sandwich. Opted for A Wreck for myself who's ingredients read like an Italian sandwich, and a Hammie for the kiddo. It's ham and cheese.\\n\\nI was a bit impressed with guy1's calm demeanor in a place that's still fairly busy at a peak dinner time. Was preparing the order ahead of me while simultaneously taking my order and writing nothing down or entering anything into an order and he took the order calmly and confidently and didn't make me feel rushed and his demeanor didn't make me feel like he was rushed or over-worked.\\n\\nThe odd part is the yelling. Once I put in my order he yells out my order and the other two yell the order back to suggest that they heard him. This is a cheap gimmick pulled from fish markets and east coast shops. Guy1's like \\"Hey, I'm making a sandwich!\\" and the other two chirp back \\"He's making a sandwich/That guy's making a sandwich!\\"\\n\\nIs this really necessary? Guy2's whole job is to take the meat and cheese bread off the toaster that Guy1 put in place and put your choice of 9 different condiments and vegetables on the sandwich for 8 hours straight. Should he really be so surprised to find a sandwich manifest itself onto his side of the toaster without the guy yelling into the side of his head from 3 feet away? I'd like to see some headsets secret agent style where they whisper into their sleeves that the customer who just walked passed them and the sign on the door that says \\"Potbelly Sandwich Shop\\" is indeed here to order a sandwich and is definitely not lost.\\n\\nI'm such a slacker on receipts. I forget to take them and when they tell me the total of my order they might as well be telling me what they heard on The View last night, because I'm not listening.\\n\\nA Wreck reminded me of a toasted version of The Italian Night Club from Jimmy Johns, but toasted and on ciabatta and smaller, but I think I ordered the smaller one. The hot peppers actually have some spice to them, where Jimmy's are sweet and zesty these have a mild spice that slowly accumulates until the end of the sandwich where it's still tolerable to my sensibilities. The cured meats actually kind of taste like cured meats, which is always a bonus. Sometimes at these shops it just tastes like a slightly more flavorful bologna.\\n\\nI nabbed a bit of the Hammie from the kiddo. (for science). The ham was quite flavorful where many others just taste like muted versions of themselves. Notes of smokiness and well hydrated without tasting like it was reconstituted in it's own juices like the turkey packets you get at the grocery store. It's truly noteworthy that most of the sandwich made it into the kids mouth! You parents know this means something!\\n\\nTo test the practicality of the yelling, I've decided to make this a practice at home when I'm up at 6:30 making breakfast. \\"I'm making Cap'n CrunchÔøΩ?\\" I'll update and let you know how it works in a week.

Yet, somehow, I never managed to visit until last weekend.\\n\\nI was impressed right from the reservation process. They have a chef's choice menu but... actually accommodate pescitarians. That is EXTREMELY rare. Usually it's meat/vegetarian and that's it. Really great.\\n\\nAs I've seen other reviewers comment on, we arrived early and were seated immediately. Again, very impressive. I commonly make reservations and get seated after 20 minutes. I HATE that. That's why reservations exist, folks. This place is small, yet they can get me seated in a more than timely manner? Good job, guys.\\n\\nOnce my partner and I were seated we were given a complimentary champagne of sorts. Very good. Our menu sat in front of us, but I didn't quite understand how it would work- The 13 dishes offered were right there but many included meat.. did that mean I only got 7 courses? Quickly I found out that they catered each dish to my needs.\\n\\nDishes change, so I won't dwell on them too much. Everything was surprising, thought provoking, and... well... confusing. Egg, wasabi ice cream, and mackerel worked in the best of ways. I adored the beet, mushroom, and cookie dish because... I couldn't even tell that was what it was. It's a divine feeling to have something really great that just.. doesn't make sense. I've never felt such a dubious delight.\\n\\nI think it's worth mentioning that some of the dishes made to placate the poor non meat eater were even better than the intended dish. According to my boyfriend, his pig custard came nowhere near the deliciousness of my Serrano custard- one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nThere were some disappointments- The foie gras nutter butter.. was literally a nutter butter, that apparently had foie, which could in no way have been tasted based on the miniscule size. We were also excited by the beer cheese donuts which were just.. fried bread. In my interest of full experience, I ordered the drink tasting as well, which, while good- I would not recommend for the extra $45.\\n\\nI wasn't that impressed with the ambiance. I was extremely impressed with the service. Flawless transitions from each dish to the other and each drink to the other (aside from the awkward guy who kept trying to pour water into my wine, but I aint hatin')\\n\\nI'm overall unsure how to feel, here. It's rare that a meal really makes me think. The flavors were good, but what wowed me was the science behind it. I was impressed by the art rather than the flavor- which is not a bad thing- but I don't think I'd drop $120 again just for one. I don't think I've ever had to contemplate food before and this really intrigues me, but there isn't really a dish that I NEED to have again. As much as I hate to do it, and as unsure as I am- I'm going to have to give 3 stars.

With that said, Barley Swine lived up to my expectations and more!\\n\\nPersonally, I like well-paced meals. I enjoy having the option of savoring a dish at my leisure. The wonderful thing is that Barley more than allows you to do so. Yes, there are days when I am time-pressed and I just want to stuff my face and keep it moving, but eating is an experience meant to be enjoyed. I really appreciate the pacing that is implemented at Barley. At no point did I feel rushed but every time I was ready for something new, it almost miraculously appeared in front of me! My life in general is pretty hectic so I especially enjoy moments where I can unwind. \\n\\nOur server Claire was funny and attentive and she and I even chatted about my new sparkly shoes. Billy was also wonderful and stopped by regularly to see how things were going. I pretty much liked every dish at Barley. In contrast my biggest complaint about Odd Duck was that some of the dishes contained elements that were just not complimentary. There isn't that issue at all at Barley. My favorite dish was probably the Biscuits and Bacon. I love that they used house-cured Bacon and the entire dish was perfectly cohesive. I also loved the Escolar. It was poached in olive oil which made it unbelievably tender. I actually remarked that it cut like a semi-firm tofu. Definitely one of the stars of the night.\\n\\nI can see why Barley Swine is like the parent to Odd Duck. The dishes are more cohesive and there are no jarring elements to distract you from your dining experience. With all that said my only minor gripe is that it is a prix fixe menu. There are times when a dish is more stellar than others and I do like having the option of ordering a second serving of said dish. However, it's not like most people are unaware that Barley has a prix fixe menu, so it kind of just comes with the territory; I just wish I could have had more Escolar. \\n\\nBarley Swine is definitely a wonderful dining experience and I appreciate their adventurous flavor and texture pairings.

The one star is for their horribly rude service. \\n\\nI was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\\n\\nPoint of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM.

Our server tried to take it away once the mussels were gone and we pretty much slapped his hand and just asked for MOAR NAAN.  \\n\\nFor dinner, we all ordered a hodge podge of food and went for it family style.  The mixed grill from the tandoor was probably actually my least favorite, some of the meat was a little chewy, but saying that, it was still pretty good.  The Goan Yellow Curry with shrimp was a surprise standout for me - I'm usually not that much into those coconuty flavors as I just want some spice, but it was a perfect balance.

We also had the dumplings (our favorite dish!), the chicken udon noodles that were a bit spicy but very good, and the chicken wings (good), plus sides of rice.

Our beer and bar drinks arrived and then we waited 40 minutes for the salads and another 25 for the entrees.  It seemed way too long to wait especially since it was not busy or crowded.\\n\\nWhen the entrees came they were ok but cold; the baked potato's butter didn't melt because the potato was too cool.  The fish was heavily breaded but the fries and cole slaw were pretty good.  The steak was cold and tasted old like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for a while.  Chicken tenders with sweet potato fries were good but needed to be hotter in temperature.

I will review my most recent which was this past Saturday night. The place was full and the staff seemed a little in the weeds. There is no host or hostess to greet you, so we stood there for a good 5 minutes before being ushered to our seats. So it's a small room, we *had* to have been seen before then, not to mention that my friends are two of the tallest people I know personally and there's no *way* they weren't spotted! We were a party of 4 with a reservation which we were about 5 minutes late for - oopsie. I'm sure that's somehow my fault. Once seated, it took some time to be approached to give our drink order (another 7 minutes or so), and once we gave that order, it became painfully clear that a hostess was not the only staff member they were missing. There is no bartender there, and one of the waiters? the busboy? made the drinks. Which were quite tasty, but took over 10 minutes to get to us. I was beginning to wish I ordered wine instead of a Pineapple Martini (but I loooooove Skyy Pineapple, so I *had* to). So, we've been here for 20 minutes already and are just getting our drinks. The busboy did serve us water, which I drank right away and was not refilled. Even when asked. \\n\\nThe waiter was apologetic, but seemed to shuffle the blame off onto the busboy, and I'm not certain that everything was that poor kid's fault. In any event, we ordered our food, appetizers came out within a reasonable time (I loved my tomato, gorgonzola salad, and wish I had some right now). My dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs as well. But then there was a huge lag before the entrees. Like more than a half an hour, which goes by even more slowly when the drinks are being made by Slowy McSlowerson. And still no water! They brought more bread though, which I know tickled one of my DCs. \\"You mean the bread started tickling him??\\" No - it's a figure of speech, sheesh! When the food did arrive, the pasta e fagiole I ordered seemed bland (my Mom used to make it with salt pork for a nice meaty, slightly smoky flavor). This one lacked seasoning so I had to put a fair amount of salt and cheese on it to make it palatable. My friend ordered the chicken broccoli and ziti but wanted the homemade fusili instead which they goofed on and forgot. They did realize their mistake, though, and offered a free dessert. My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food (one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu, actually, a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce, and it was gooeyyummydelicious)! \\n\\nThis is not a good place to go to if you're \\"fungry\\" or will get cranky because you haven't eaten all day before showing up. At least not on the weekend. The weeknight experience I had with my favorite DC was quite different as the service wasn't scattered or slow. I'll go back there, because of the value and convenience ($150.00 before tip for 4 people, all of whom drank alcohol and got plenty of food), but perhaps not on a weekend, and perhaps not to order the pasta e fagiole again. They were friendly and I always like to go to a non-chain, small, family-owned place."},{"name":"Matchstick Coffee Roasters","address":"639 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Takes forever, nice clean decor but no character in this place at all, and coffee tastes exactly like every other local coffee place in Vancouver.

It reminded me of Cocoa Pebbles, I mean that in the best way.Chamomile, berries - This was the best dessert that I can recollect. The berries had such intense flavor it was incredible! I ate my husband's too.\\n\\nThe final pairing was Prearis Quadrupel/Belgium.Mesquite bean, chocolate - This play on the churro was very yummy, but I gave mine to the husband after a taste since I wanted to savor the berries from the last dessert.\\n\\nWe were blown away.

The choice of sides that night were fries, onion rings, Caesar salad and a curry type of cauliflower thing.  I really liked the cauliflower, but others at my table didn't.  The Caesar dressing on the salad had no taste.  The buns were the same on all the burgers and they were nothing special about them.  I would have loved a  thinner bun with some toasty/crispiness to it, whereas theirs were pretty fluffy/oily/bready.\\n\\nRichard Blaise, while present behind the bar sporadically, did not speak to any of the diners while I was there, which I thought was pretty rude for a \\"friends and family\\" pre-opening.

They remembered the tiniest details about myself and my partner and info was passed effortlessly from one person to another to ensure that everything went smoothly.  \\n\\nNow our waitress, miss Brandy!

If you go here be sure to ask for her if you can. \\n\\nNow.....the food!   Holy shit haha. This food was insane.  Two highlight dishes for me we're the pasta and the steak. Get them and you will understand why. Having lived in Houston for years and traveled a lot, we consider ourselves foodies with access to some of the best restaurants in the country.  However, even with all Houston has to offer and all we've consumed during our travels, we have never and I mean, NEVER, had a more creative, complex, and good tasting meal anywhere.  This was hands down the best we've had. To the Chef, thank you for having the passion you do and creating an amazing atmosphere where you offer guests the chance to have a 5 star meal.  It was incredible.  \\n\\nOdd Duck, another restaurant owner by the Chef, was also incredible.   \\n\\nAnywho, go here.  Get everything. Eat everything. Laugh. Smile.

If so then it's a total rip. even the happy hour wings is a total rip. the 50 cent Tuesday deal seems more like it, but if the 'happy hour wings' are 6 bucks and you only get 5 then what gives? If the 'regular priced' wings 'if' (and I say if becuase I have no idea) you get more for 9 bucks, then the happy hour price really isnt a happy hour deal then is it? If the regular 9 dollar deal is say 10 wings, then if you get 5 for 6 bucks at happy hour, all they are doing is shorting you the wings!

Many restaurants do not play TV volume, and compensate with their choice in music. Remember when this place had channel selector box's on the table to let you choose what you wanted to hear? She had the Baby back ribs, and I the St. Louis style. They used to come to your table, open a bag for rib bones, explain the sauces, and ask if you were in need of anything extra. This was a drop and run. We opened our own bag and asked another server what the different sauces were. My corn side dish went back right away because it was barely warm. So did my replacement corn. I switched to cole slaw. Next my ribs went back because they were not succulent at all. They were over-smoked to dry. I switched to pulled pork, because I knew it only needed to be plated from a steam table. I wanted to eat with my wife, not watch her while they cooked something else. The mark of a customer service retaurant is one that apolagizes and compensates to make it right. 2 cold sides, and a bad entree resulted in the check being changed to remove the item and add the new. It was dropped on our table with out an offer of dessert. This was all going on while staff huddled nearby dragging together tables, discussing it, and dragging them apart. They did this twice. Trying to decide if it would be too crowded to sit that many people around that small of a table. TWICE.

I had a delicious entree of steamed bass with saffron vegetables.  The fish was tender and flaky with just the right amount of saffron atop a pile of steamed and saffron infused vegetables.  Entrees also make use of that nifty little lazy susan - vegetables of the day (4 in all) are places on geometrically inset plates for sharing among the table.  Ours included a chick pea and cinnamon mix, garlic mashed potatoes, creamed cauliflower, etc.   Our dessert of the marscarpone cheesecake was a bit nontraditional but absolutely delicious:  the warm, sweet cheesy mixture was piled next to a dollop of warm blueberry compote.  Yummy.\\n\\nThe only complaint I had about the experience was our server's lack of training.  He was chatty and well meaning, but couldn't answer much about the wine list or menu.

We waited in line about 30 minutes at 2pm on a Friday. I can't imagine what it's like at noon. My husband has a disability that makes it hard for him to stand, so that was inconvenient. In addition, I then had carry two trays of food across the restaurant and through the back doors to the patio because that's where there were open tables (first world problems, I know).

I ordered them with a side of \\"Hoppin' John\\" (a mixture of various beans and stewed tomatoes), french fries, and hush puppies.  I also added a dessert; the mini banana creme pie.  The pork chop from my entree was HUGE, bone-in and served on a bed of white rice.  I ordered the \\"Generous\\" portion that included the 3 side-items (instead of 2 for the \\"Plenty\\" portion) and cornbread.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We paid and went to sit down in the family-style seating area.  Apparently when really busy it's encouraged to share tables with your neighbors.  I dove right in to the Hoppin' John; it was not what I was expecting... It was bland, with the textures and ingredients I was expecting something different I guess.  Then onto the pork chop - it was \\"smothered\\" in a thick mushroom gravy; the first bite was underwhelming and also unexpectedly un-flavorful.  These dishes lacked the \\"Soul\\" in Soul Food/Southern cuisine.  The french fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The Hush Puppies were in one word - PHENOMENAL.  Arguably the best I've ever had, fried perfectly, freshly made and extremely delicious.  Now onto the cornbread... At first glance it looks good, but once you pick it up and realize how heavy and dense with grease it is; it becomes very unappetizing very quickly.  I could only take one bite before putting it down and never returning for another taste.  It was the size and weight of a yellow grease-soaked hockey puck.

The wine choices were some of the best I've seen. I actually commented to the waitress about that, and she said the chef is really into wine, so that was the reason why. The cheese and charcuterie cart that came around was awesome. The buratta, proscuitto and olives were amazing! \\n\\nFor dinner 2 of us got swordfish and another got the roasted chicken. We were all raving about our meals!  (The three of us are always trying out new restaurants, so we are pretty hard to impress). \\n\\nI heard the restaurant got a bad review from a publication (maybe Boston globe) but I'm happy we tried it regardless.  \\n\\nThe decor was cozy and cool.

It's so rare to have a space like this, and I loved the fact that I was studying under the beautiful blue skies and natural light. (How awesome would it be to read a book while it's drizzling outside in this room?!)\\n\\nFood/drink: I got the double espresso and a bacon & cheese quiche, and both were splendid. The double espresso was pulled perfectly both times I ordered, and with a touch of brown sugar, brought out the bright and tangy flavors (not too much acidity, I love it!). The quiche was not as warm as I would have liked it, but I loved the single portion style of it, with the amazing crunchy crust that holds the whole thing together.\\nService: I think the fact that they bring out your drinks to you is a great touch to the shop.

It only comes in one size, just so you know you don't have to choose between a cup, bowl, jug, whatever. It was pretty textbook. Nothing too far out of the ordinary, weird, complicated, etc. It's just hearty chicken noodle, brosef. \\n\\nThen, the salad plate. Greens, carrots, grapes, tomatoes, and some of the tastiest curry chicken salad I've ever had. The chicken salad is so fine, but still retaining thickness, that it's spreadable. It's creamy, but not in a gross way like some chicken salads are -- AKA they don't go overboard with mayo. To add onto this flavor train, the dressing they give you on the side is rather magical. It's a semi-sweet, ginger dressing. I can't put my finger on the entire flavor profile, but it is perfect. I used it in moderation to not overpower any of the other flavors, but man they do it right. I can see that working on a multitude of dishes. \\n\\nI'm really digging Cafe at Pharr. It's a healthy choice and they do one of my favorite things perfectly. Well done, folks.

I live across the street, which is a MAJOR bonus for any place in my book. The first time I went, a friend and I walked in, sat down, and were promptly waited on. We got our food quickly and mine (the grilled cheese) was delicious and very reasonably priced. I was really pleased and eager to come back. The second time I came, I ordered a grilled cheese to go and again and waited maybe ten minutes and was out the door. Once again the sandwich was good, certainly worth $5! \\n\\nToday, however... I walked in just after 1pm (on a Saturday) to find the place was packed. Good for them! So I waited in line for a few minutes to order, again, a grilled cheese to go. The staff seemed insanely out of whack, they were clearly swamped, confused about whose check went with who, and the woman who took my order didn't even know what I was talking about when I told her what bread I wanted it on and seemed too busy talking to her friends sitting at the bar to pay attention to a restaurant that was basically falling down around her. I sat down to wait and waited thirty minutes - yes, THIRTY MINUTES - for a grilled cheese. In that time, I witnessed multiple people get up and leave before getting their food because the wait was taking so long. When I did get my sandwich, the woman working was nice enough to give me a cupcake on the house for my wait, but then when I got home I discovered that not only had they forgotten to give me chips with my sandwich, but my sandwich didn't have avocado on it, which is one of the main reasons I order it. It was still good, but it wasn't what I wanted and it was definitely not worth the time I waited with a friend sitting at home waiting for me!\\n\\nI think the reality is that they never seem quite prepared for the full-fledged running of this place. What's in the bakery cabinet is good but it's never full, they don't have any fresh bread, and a lot of their food isn't homemade. I would love to see the grilled cheese come with fries or salad or something besides a bag of Lays chips. When my friend ordered a salad it came with a packet of dressing on the side. It just feels lazy, which is frustrating because the food that they do make in house is really good! \\n\\nAt the end of the day, I think they just need to get it together. They never seem quite on top of what they're doing. I realize they're new, but it's not an excuse for bad service.

I had the small chicken and dumplings, my wife had the fish and chips and our friend who lives in the couve but grew up in Louisiana had the fried tomatoes. My chicken and dumplings were a  5/5. The execution was great. As others have said, a little more chicken would be great, but the dumplings were awesome. The fish and chips and fried tomatoes were 4/5. Our friend mentioned that if the tomatoes were more tart it would have been perfect, probably a seasonal thing. They tasted good to me but I didn't grow up in the south The service was great. I opted to rate this 5/5 because in this price range, this is really good food and value. It is clean and pretty nice on the inside and the food, drinks and service are pretty good too.

My gf got a salad that had radicchio in it and was mentioning to me a very normal volume that the salad was mediocre when I asked how it was. The manager, who was apparently eavesdropping on our conversation, proceeded to come over to the table and tell us that he couldn't help but overhear that she didn't like the salad. He explained that radicchio is a \\"acquired taste\\", then came back a second time when we were done with this course and accused my girlfriend of just pushing it around her plate and not eating it. He offered to take it off the bill, which was a nice gesture, though it wasn't the restaurant's fault that we didn't like radicchio and chose poorly.

It's on the left traveling South and is due West from Atlantic Station, as the crow flies. Parking is limited but free - try to visit during slightly off-hours to ensure a space. The interior is modernist with plenty of shiny white surfaces and glass. There's a nice deck out front where you can watch all the idiots get backed-up in the crappy traffic - they like it when you yell at them for no reason, but forego throwing any items at the cars - they don't like that and may pull-over to find out \\"what's your problem\\"... \\n\\nI've now visited this location a few times and I feel that it's the best of the three.I was a bit dismayed at the Buckhead location (mediocre, over-priced food and lackluster service) but the now defunct Highland location and this one have more than made up for my initial opinion. This is one of those \\"fine dining\\" attempts at burgers but don't be put-off - there are a few tricks to ordering that make Flip worthwhile. First, instead of picking one of the signature burgers, go with the sliders - it provides up to three different flavor combinations to keep things interesting. Second, have a cocktail or beer with dinner but leave some room for the delicious milkshakes - I recommend the Marshmallow Nutella unless you're not into that flavor - then go with the Krispy Kreme Donut - both live up to their respective labels.\\n\\nFor a cocktail, try the Southern Gent - it's an interesting fusion of sweet whiskey sour and will remind you of a sweet tea. To get stared, try the pork-belly-on-a-stick with Coca-Cola ketchup and pop-rocks or the smoked brisket empanadas - this latter is quite good.\\n\\nFor those sliders, try the Butcher's Cut and a Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich if they are available (the menu seems to change, or at least has changed during my last two visits) and don't forget the sweet potato tots. Or if you're really feeling it, order the trio of tots, rings and fries - very filling and all quite good as sides.

I was gunna opt for the prime rib, they were out of it at the time. No biggie I had a lobster pie in the on deck circle...So I got it, really rubbery and quite bland. The portion wasnt that great either. Not sure why I got fries with it, but I did. The fries were ok, oversalted thought. We waited another 15m after we were done for the check. When the check came, my GF and I split the bill...For the food and service we got, this place is overpriced...I heard the quality took a dive after they remodeled it, from my GF whos been going there for a while.

I read all the poor reviews to see him go to the point of attacking the patron and accusing them of being at fault for their poor service, never seen anything like it.

I hate sauerkraut and bratwurst and all that stuff. It's too heavy and it's not my thing. So I really wasn't expecting to like Schmidt's and was very pleasantly surprised when I did.\\n\\nIt's tucking away in German village. I'd never actually seen the place before because I don't venture around those parts much. But we were going here with the purpose of trying it out because I've heard so many good things. I wanted to be adventurous. \\n\\nThe place was very busy. It was around 7 on a Thursday night. But I liked the atmosphere. Very German, but not overbearingly so. There were some men in liederhosen and they were the band that was playing German music. They did a few requests and popular songs German style. The Simpsons and Family Theme songs come to mind.\\n\\nWe couldn't come here and not try some of the beers. Some of what they have is from the Elevator's Brewery. I had the Hefeweizen all night. I was disappointed to find that they didn't have any sort of happy hour, but oh well. The beer was excellent and served with a lemon wedge on the glass.\\n\\nWe decided to try the Schmidt's Famous Pretzel Nuggets as an appetizer. But - our server forgot to put the order in and we didn't get them until after we already had our food. That kinda sucked. But they were delicious - they were fried, but no batter so they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sweet honey mustard dipping sauce was addicting.\\n\\nI wasn't too sure what to order since I don't like German and just about everything on the menu was bratwurst and stuff like that. So I went with the Bahama Burger Special. The \\"Bahama Mama\\" is what this place is famous for. It's their specialty brat that's spicy. I wanted to try it, but wasn't sure. This dish comes with it in the form of a burger, so the cut is like a patty and there's no casing, which sounded good to me. It also came on a pretzel bun with tomato, onion and lettuce and swiss cheese. And guess what? I loved it. It was amazing. Not as spicy as I hoped, but I really liked it. I got the potato pancakes with applesauce as my side. They were good, little round cakes that were good dipped in the chunky applesauce. Yummy, but not all that great.\\n\\nJeff got the Bahama Mama platter, which came with cole slaw, potato salad, and was a huge brat on top of sauerkraut. It also came with a big toasted bun. He loved it.\\n\\nFor dessert we knew we had to get cream puffs. They are huge and look delicious - there is a display case filled with them right when you walk in the door. A clever marketing strategy if I ever saw one. It works. We were planning to share one but couldn't agree on one. So we got two, which ended up being insane because there was no way we could eat it all. He ate about half of his and I only managed about 5 or 6 bites of mine. Jeff got the chocolate one. It was a light fluffy sauce that wasn't at all too much chocolate. It was topped with powdered sugar and chocolate drizzle. I got the special buckeye one that was filled with light peanut butter cream and topped with this fudgy chocolate and nuts. Wonderful. I'm not a huge cream puff fan, but these were great.\\n\\nOur server was nice. He gave us one of our cream puffs half off because of the appetizer trouble. I wish we just gave us the pretzels for free, though. At $5.25 per puff, we didn't get much of a discount. And our bill was crazy! About $70 for all this food and beer. I guess it wasn't awful, but still. I wish this place was cheaper, but I did have enough left over for another meal. Jeff didn't, though.\\n\\nI will come back for sure, but I'll know that it can get pricey. But I was really impressed with how much I liked it despite my dislike for German foods.

However this evening I felt I had to unfortunately write this review about my service. \\n\\nI went to Barcelona Wine Bar tonight with a large party (12 people) and when it came time to settle the bill, we divided it by what we ordered. We are all working women and could not split the check evenly because many of us only got drinks (myself included). \\n\\nOur waitress was very put out that we were not hurrying the bill to her to be charged. Granted....we were a large party, and we were her last table...but we were calculating the money to charge per card (we did not ask her to do the math as we knew that would be too much to ask). \\n\\nShe came back to our table at least 5 times to hover over us if we were done. It was uncomfortable and we were hurrying the best we could. She was even put off that we were doing the check this way when we told her. \\n\\nI had only order 1 glass of red sangria and was over charged what I put down (over $10). Needless to say I will not be going back to this establishment.

I stopped in here for lunch last week after a nearby appointment.  While the menu seems very fun and inviting for the adventurous diner, I guess I just wasn't in the mood to spend $19 on a burger and rings.\\n\\nIn all fairness, the food was good, just not outstanding.  I had the lamburger ($12), which was enjoyable, but there was WAY too much going on under the bun.  Let's see...marinated (read 'pickled') vegetables, arugula and pickled onions, citrus goat cheese, tzaziki sauce and, oh yeah, the burger!  IMO, they should scrap everything pickled and stick with the  basics; burger, cheese, arugula and sauce...maybe a mango chutney or something.  They should learn the lesson that simplicity is highly underrated.  The onion rings ($4 for about 10 rings) were also good, but I've had better for less.  Not sure what beer mustard is, but is tasted an awful lot like light honey mustard.  Not offensive, they just expended lots of effort where they could have backed off and let the food speak for itself.\\n\\nThe people couldn't have been nicer, and very attentive.  The place was busy at 2:00pm on a Friday, which says something.  I'm going back at some point for just a regular old burger.

Thus I had the following:\\n\\nAji Amarillo Seafood Chowder - Appetizer\\nChalaco Ceviche\\nBraised Red Deer Venison Neck and Chorizo\\nLomo Saltado\\nCrab and Wild Sockeye Salmon Cakes\\nAji Panca Chili and Orange Glazed Baby Back Ribs\\nChicharron Sliders\\nYucca Bola\\nCausa Verduras\\nPollo Anticuchos\\nTacu Tacu\\nChocolate y Caf√© Enamorados - Dessert\\n\\nThe Aji Amarillo Seafood Chowder came with a mix of mussels and mixed seafood in a chili cream chowder. This had some very chewy mussels and was on the borderline of being classified as a stew. Good balance of flavour and served hot.\\n\\nThe Chalaco Ceviche was a swirl of tuna, salmon, ling cod, prawns, scallops, green tigre de leche citrus, orange, and rocoto chili-dusted fried calamari.There was a ton going on in this plate and each bite was a good mix of seafood (mostly calamari though).\\n\\nThe Braised Red Deer Venison Neck and Chorizo came with slow-braised venison neck and chorizon, Peruvian corn, and grana padano cheese grits. This was one of the better-presented dishes. Compared to other options, this wasn't as exciting, but a safe choice nonetheless.\\n\\nThe Lomo Saltado was probably the highest calorie option entree. This came with medium rare Bavette steak, Kennebec fries, onions, pepers, tomato stir fry, and rich veal demi. The fries were surprisingly crispy and this might be mistaken for a Peruvian version of a poutine. The steak pieces were pretty sparse compared to the amount of fries.\\n\\nThe Crab and Wild Sockeye Salmon Cakes came with Peruvian tartar and pickled cucumber and young coconut meat escabeche salad. This was a beautiful dish and reminded me of a plump and filling falafel ball minus the skin. The crab taste was very present and the cakes mixed well with the tartar.\\n\\nThe Aji Panca Chili and Orange Glazed Baby Back Ribs were served with double-smoked bacon, green bean, and red nugget potato salad. The potatoes were a little hard in this dish but the baby back ribs were very tender. Bonus: There are 5 bones to the ribs so if you have 5 diners this is an easy split.\\n\\nThe Chicharron Sliders came with crispy pork belly, glazed yam, aji Amarillo aioli, and rocoto chili-dusted yam chips. The yam chips weren't too exciting if you got plantain for the appetizer, but the crispy pork belly was the star of this dish. The bread had a doughy taste with a sour zing which was an interesting change but may not be welcome for everyone.\\n\\nThe Yucca Bola was a plate of cassava root croquettes filled with asiago cheese, jalapenos, scallions, sweet rocoto chili house-made jelly, and Peruvian Huancaina sauce. These were delicious. I'm biased for croquettes and these didn't disappoint. The melting cheese made tearing a bite off very satisfying but there could have been more advertised jalapeno taste.\\n\\nThe Causa Verduras was beet root whipped and served with chilled potatoes, lima bean puree, pickled beets, and rocoto chili dusted yam chips. This was a cold entree and I didn't enjoy it. Presentation-wise, this was the coolest out of the 10, but the chilled taste was unfortunately not my type.\\n\\nThe Pollo Anticuchos was a plate of aji Amaillo chili-marinated chicken breast skewers, brown-buttered fingerling potatoes, and a trio of aji sauces. The sauces here were the same used in the plantain chips. The chicken wasn't that tender but they did have a distinctive grilled taste. This was one of the leaner entrees calorie-wise.\\n\\nThe Tacu Tacu was a spicy butternut squash winter stew, crispy lima bean, rice cakes, parmesan, and a fried quail's egg. The quail egg was actually more over easy than fried, the butternut squash wasn't very spicy at all, and this didn't taste as interesting as what its name suggested, in my opinion. \\n\\nLastly, the Chocolate y Caf√© Enamorados. This was a mix of coffee and chocolate pot de cr√®me, spike rocoto chili whipped cream, and canela sugared plantains. I thought the plantains were pretty salty, but sweetness was made up by digging them into the mousse-like rich chocolate which had a smooth and dark taste to it. This was a great sweet finisher for the night."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've only had the buffet at the Clay Pit.

Dunno, really. But my first Hopdoddy experience wasn't the greatest. Had a couple of out of town visitors for the day and we all decided to try Hopdoddy for lunch. The line to get in, which is normally down the block, was fairly short and manageable. My high hopes were lifted even more because of that. The line inside forms right down the middle of the restaurant. Which meant that my guests and I were asked to move out of a servers way many more times than once. Most were nice about it; you can't help being in the way because of how the line is set up. One server, who was apparently having a very bad day, was not so nice about it. He was downright rude, actually. And, no. We were not standing in the areas where signs directed us not to stand. We were merely standing in line waiting to order our food. We finally get to the counter to order. 2 burgers. 1 salad. Order of truffle fries. 2 milkshakes. 1 beer. Over $70 with tax and tip. That's a lot of money for a burger joint. I was also a little taken aback at being asked to tip before any service was given. But I did tip, because I appreciate and respect the work of food service workers. Got our table. Nice young woman brings our order. The truffle fries were amazing. Best part of the whole meal. Milkshakes were good, but not $6 each good. The burgers were the biggest disappointment. The other burger orderer at my table said his was ok, but not nearly as good as he had thought it might be. I took a bite of his. His assessment was correct. It was just a decent burger, nothing special. Mine was grossly undercooked in the middle. Our server never came back to the table to check on us and a very kind young man offered to go find her. She finally showed up after I had eaten the cooked edges of the burger and was no longer in the mood for the rest of it, cooked or not. I didn't really want another burger at that point. I didn't want what was left of the one I had to be cooked some more. Maybe I would have wanted those things 30-40 minutes earlier if she had ever come back to the table. She didn't offer any of those things, anyway, so it was a good thing I didn't want them, I suppose. She apologized that my burger was so undercooked. And left. I was appreciative that I at least got that. Maybe I went to Hopdoddy on a bad day. Maybe another visit would prove more satisfying. Not sure yet, whether I'm willing to give it another try or not. Those truffle fries sure were good, though. But, still."},{"name":"Pintxo Pincho Tapas Bar","address":"385 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here on two occasions now, both times were for an early dinner so we avoided the rush. We arrived at 5pm but by 6pm on a Saturday night there was already a wait for the bar and a table. The bar is on the smaller side but that is where I have usually sat. The sangria is delicious and a must try. Plus like an authentic tapas bar, they give you a little mini-appetizer with your drink. The owner and staff were all friendly if not only a little overwhelmed, which must be a night occurrence here. The food came out of the kitchen at a good pace and I would say between 2 - 4 tapas per person is sufficient. \\n\\nKobe Empanada - Great beef empanadas. Could I tell whether or not Kboe was used? Definitely not, but it sure was still very good and reasonably priced.\\n\\nIberico ham - Do you like prosciutto? Then you will love this. Some of the finest ham Spain has to offer.\\n\\nPan con tomate - Toasted bread with a tomato, simple and delicious.\\n\\nBlue cheese steak - I love blue cheese and steak so I also really enjoyed the flavor profile of this dish.\\n\\nSquid ink pie - One of the more unique items I have tried here. It is served at room temperature was filled with calamari. This item is a little more adventurous but I really enjoyed it and would order it again.\\n\\nCeviche - If you like ceviche then order some because it was delicious\\n\\nOxtail - The slow cooked oxtail was served with mushroom and was very tender. If you like beef then don't be afraid of the oxtail. \\n\\nShrimp in sizzling garlic oil - This item is always a hit and I consider it a must-get item. Dipping some bread in the hot garlic oil is highly recommended.\\n\\nCrab Croquettes - Almost like little fried crab cakes. The crab meat was plentiful and tasted very fresh. \\n\\nAlmond Custard - This was like a creme brulee except without the crunchy top. The bottom was coated with a candied almond type of paste. Similar to what you would find in an almond croissant."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay I'll say this review is long overdue.

Being a good person I figured I should check out Blue Star Donuts. \\n\\nLikes: I'd heard about this place years ago and determined that I was going to visit on this trip to Oregon. I'm glad I did. They have pretty amazing donuts. They aren't your typical greasy, sugar-drenched American creations. They actually follow some French recipes. What you end up with is a lighter donut that shows off the fillings or toppings rather than your taste-buds getting distracted by all the grease. I ordered 3 total and snacked on them throughout the day. The passionfruit chocolate nib was my absolute favorite. It had a sweet yet tangy flavor and I liked the texture of the coarse ground chocolate shavings on top. I wished that the pina colada donut had more flavor but it was ok. The bacon maple donut was great, if you like sweet/salty combos. Their bacon was thick, smoked bacon, not the cheap bacos you get at most bakeries.\\n\\nDislikes: We showed up mid-day for our treats but were turned away. Even though we could clearly see several racks of donuts they told us they had to \\"set up\\" for the afternoon rush. We almost didn't make it back."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"so i came to Boston on a business trip, and after work hours we decided to take a walk and stop by at this bar. so i gave the bouncer my ID card and since in my photo i look darker (i had a tan) and had black hair , which now i died it blonde they did not let me in!!! she was staring at my ID and me for a while and then asked for something that had my name on it, so i gave her my debit card which had the same identical name and still did not let me in. like are u serious???

I might go back again to try other stuff, but the flavors were so muddled, uninspiring and bogged down. My husband and I ordered the pomegranate duck wings. The duck meat itself was very dry and the charring on the skin did not fly with the very sweet/syrupy pomegranate sauce. The pork and chive dumplings were good, but not like amazing or anything. Your local Chinese takeout window has delicious ones you can get for much cheaper. I picked out the wild mushroom lo mein and it was totally different from what I expected. The mushroom flavor basically settled to the very bottom of the dish and I think someone forgot to add the miso paste. I felt like the kitchen sabotaged the dish with soy sauce and black pepper, then fried it a little too long before it was brought to our table. It tasted like a leftover miso spaghetti recipe from Bon Appetit magazine. The Korean sloppy Joe was underwhelming too. It was spicy, which was fun, but still somehow bland and left much to be desired. The sweet potato chips that come with it are so whatever and not even worth adding to a plate in my opinion.\\n\\nGo to Shojo if you want to try Asian Fusion food that's taking risks and actually really fun to eat. I like the atmosphere in this place - everything about the branding is spot on and cohesive - but I wish the food was more thrilling.

We followed the dreaded GPS which played a cruel joke by bringing us to the exact Baby A's we were trying to avoid because of all the bad reviews. Well it lived up to them.  I ordered chicken fajitas because eating somewhere new I dont take chances, and it's virtually impossible to mess up fajitas, but this place did. The chicken meat was as if out of a pressure cooker or a frozen bag, and there were no peppers & onions, and the guacomole was just gross like out of a tub. Two of us were sick after eating the food and our two small kids just picked at their food--thank goodness they didn't eat it. Typically they gobble up Mexican, but their good kiddie senses served them well this time.  We ordered queso as soon as we sat down so we'd get it before our food, but that didn't happen. We kept running out of chips and salsa with our one basket & bowl although our group was large--really you can't give us two?? We didn't have enough flatware for our party and although I asked for it twice, we never got it & ended up sharing.  First I ordered a Midori margarita, and it had a taste of sulfur in it, so either the glass was dirty or the ice isn't filtered? Hard to tell, but I couldn't drink it. So then I ordered a classic top shelf margarita with salt and a GM floater which didn't have any GM in it--not hard to taste--forgot the salt-- & I must say it was the nastiest bitterest margarita I've ever had --tasted like lime juice, silver tequila, and ice without triple sec, just nasty. They are supposed to bring the floater in a shot glass on the side, so classless is also the order of the day here. I asked about the floater & the server argued with me, then showed up later with a shot of GM...really? So...I had also asked for the kids' beans to be sprinkled with some cheese and later in looking at the receipt I see a charge not only for that, but also for the GM floater they forgot.  So they will nickel & dime you to death!  I also had a problem with our server spinning around and rushing off before I'd finished speaking, and even after yelling after them, they'd keep going. Horrible service, horrible food, and WAY over priced.

By the time they opened at 9 the line was at least 50 people long. They had a great rhythm to getting the place opened and sat to make sure the kitchen didn't get totally slammed.\\n\\nOur group of 4 got 2 of the fricassee, a paella and a cassoulet. We also got 2 of the waffles with the salted caramel sauce, 2 Americanos, a mocha and a vanilla latte. \\n\\nAll of the coffees were very good. The waffles with the salted caramel were amazing. Just a small couple of bites and very delicious. You could make a meal out of them but I think it's a nice pre-entr√©e sweet course. Everyone was more than satisfied with their entrees. The fricassee was very tasty, everything cooked correctly (my eggs were a little closer to over hard than over easy but I like them either way so not an issue), the short ribs pieces were moist, plentiful and tasted amazing. There was also balsamic onions, potatoes, applewood smoked cheddar and watercress. The grilled focaccia on the side was tasty but not really necessary. Reviews for the paella were very high although not \\"a traditional paella\\"... the description on the menu covers that it won't be and it was incredible at any rate. The cassoulet also got good reviews but had an incredible amount of beans in it. While our friend was going light on the beans as there was a flight coming in the near future the quantity was way too large regardless of flavor or travel plans :)\\n\\nAll in all it was an amazingly good brunch with some fantastic friends in a place we selected purely from these reviews. 4 specialty coffees, 2 sweet treats before our 4  amazingly flavorful entrees all for right about $80?

The menu is straightforward and easy to understand. \\n\\nWe gave a good look at the menu and decided what we wanted, had to order the chili cheese fries. I got the classic burger with cheese and bacon, he got the Goodnight and two soft drinks. One of the best parts is they serve Maine Root soda, Dublin Dr. Pepper and Coke. On that same bar they also had some typical condiments, dill pickles and some bread and butter pickles. There was also some curry ketchup, honey mustard (I think) and BBQ sauce. \\n\\nThe main dining room was a pretty awesome set up, they were all high top tables with some booths and bar stools. The bar was nice and had a pretty great set up. \\n \\nThe wait was fairly short and our food arrived on trays. The chili cheese fries was a fairly large portion and the cheese came on the side, I personally like that more so that the fries don't get all soggy. \\n\\nNow on to the best part, OMG these burgers were huge. The buns looked excellent, and you could tell they were fresh. The toppings were not over powering. The size of the burger was huge, easily a half-pound, oh I forgot to say that they ask you how you like your burger cooked. Mine was cooked medium and it came out that way, still plenty juicy and yummy. \\n\\nFirst bite was like heaven. I literally thought my boyfriend was going to stand up and dance, he was so happy. He made some crude comment about McDonalds and then nothing else was said as we dug into our awesome burgers and really good fries. Oh and I'll agree with others that the music selection is great, none of that typical thrown together icky stuff, but a good choice. \\n\\nOverall this was an awesome meal and I know we will be back soon.

We were celebrating my dad's birthday and went out to eat a family meal.  My brother ordered the Lobster Mac n Cheese and went with a full order (this cost $24).  One thing you have to understand about my brother is that he is built like a stick, he decided to get the full order because he could bring the leftovers home with him.\\n\\nSo the end of the meal rolls around and both myself and him decided to take the rest of our food back.  I ordered the Pumpkin Risotto and also had a fair amount left on the plate.  We ask the waitress to pack our leftovers and she comes back with a plastic bag containing the leftovers in two boxes.  We never opened the leftovers at the restaurant to check, I mean why would we?  I guess we were naive to assume that the restaurant would give us the food we paid for.\\n\\nWe came home and decided to put the food away in the fridge.  That's when we noticed that the box containing my brothers food was tiny, compared to mine.  This was despite the fact that his portion was much larger and he barely ate a quarter of it.  It was at that point we realized that  either the waiter or the kitchen staff had basically taken my brothers leftovers for themselves and put a skimpy serving in a small take out box.\\n\\nI hope this is clear.  THEY TOOK OUR LEFTOVERS FOR THEMSELVES!

When I walked into the restaurant, the staff was very friendly.  The restauraunt was wide-open and spacious, as if built to handle a massive crowd.  Then I looked for the menus on the wall, and they were placed in awkward spaces -- you had to be in line to really get an idea of what the menu consisted of and what the restaurante offered.  All this aside, I made it to the front (no waiting on this Sunday afternoon) and not wanting to have standard chicken fingers, ordered one piece of their regular chicken, and one piece of their citrus chicken.  For sides I ordered fried plantains and beans.  Their regular chicken was flavorful and very moist, I thought it was definitely a big hit, and that it was better than standard KFC fare.  The citrus chicken was also moist and flavorful, but finished with a very strong salty aftertaste.  So skip the citrus chicken unless you really crave lemon/lime flavors with your chicken and don't mind the accompanying saltiness.  The plantains were fine - fresh and ripe, then perfectly cooked/fried, and with a wonderfully sweet flavor.  But the biggest hit of all (and to me the greatest surprise) were the beans.  The beans were incredibly flavorful, not overpowering, and without overuse of peppers and no hint of cilantro.  This was pure gourmet latin-style flavor and I loved them.  So folks, the BEANS make Pollo Campero worth visiting, and their regular chicken would probably satisfy the most picky eater.  Everything else in this restaurant is not a big deal, although I did not try their bakery corner and may take a look there at some future visit.

Never mind that they gave me the rare patty that my table mate ordered, and gave him my medium.  But not so many restaurants will serve a rare burger in Austin, so they gets points for that.

However, they were all little stubby pieces, and inch or so long.  I don't think that any were over two inches.  They are the thin cut style.  So you have to grab several in you fingers to get a bite.  And then dipping them in ketchup or mustard (they provided a little paper cup of both) is a real problem.  They come scattered on an aluminum tray that is too big for the order.  So they aren't in a warm pile, but rather a cool, thin layer.  Most burger places do better.  I give the fries a D.\\n\\nNow for the chili cheese fries.  Take the above described thin layer of cool, stubby thin fries scattered on an aluminum tray.  And in the center of  the tray plop down a cardboard bowl of room temperature chili with grated yellow cheese sitting firmly on top with zero chance of any melt.  It was a catastrophe!  You have almost no good options.  The fries are too small to dip in the chili which is too cool to be dipped into at any rate.  You're not about to try to glop the chili and grated cheese onto the tray with the fries because it would be just too gross.  And the cheap plastic fork they served them with was just too depressing.  I expect (and can get) better at any 7-Eleven and up.

The chocolate coating was nice and rich and the little cocoa crunch pearls were a nice touch. The hard apple cider fritter was super dense and still a bit doughy in the center, and I didn't get much of an apple taste from it. It also did not have the nice crunch that I like about apple fritters. The blueberry bourbon basil donut, which seems to be one of the more popular choices, was good, but not mind-blowing great. It was your semi-above average soft cake donut, and coated with a sweet blueberry glaze.

I suggest a rich bodied red wine if you will order this dish- you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n   I was able to sample the grilled boneless chicken that is marinated overnight, and although it was good, I think it is a crime not to order a dish prepared in one of their wonderful tasty curry sauces.

Surprisingly they took them off the bill, unnecessary but appreciated.  They were good boneless wings, meaty, in a crispy batter and sweet sauce.  No heat in the sauce, so you'll want to eat the sliced jalapenos they come with, along with some pineapple and crispy house-made chips.  There was a ranch dipping sauce that went well on the chips and, later, with the fries.\\n\\nThe weekly special, Haystack burger was very good: perfectly cooked, decent size patty.  Good bun, good toppings, combining into a very enjoyable burger.  Onion strings, cheese, smoky mayo, etc.  Served in a foil wrap, which made for less messy eating. The fries are fine, big steak fries, but I suggest upgrading or swapping unless you really really like fries.  I didn't finish mine, which makes \\"all you can eat fries\\" pointless.  \\n\\nService was great the whole way through, even though they started to get busy as I left.  Prices are good.  The burger and fries was $7 I think; they have much bigger and more expensive burgers, but that was a heckuva deal for what I got.  Wings were free this time, but prices were reasonable on the menu.

They serve up some really tasty tapas at fairly reasonable prices given the quality, and I just enjoy the fun of picking and trying out new items (especially nice as they seem to switch up the menu often). Here's my thoughts on a few of the dishes/items I've tried here:\\n\\nSangria: Nice and fruity, but too watered-down in my opinion. The glass I got was almost entirely ice, so a bit disappointing on that front.\\n\\nHangar Steak: I really enjoyed this; it's just mini-slices of steak so not the most interesting dish, but the meat was well-cooked and good quality.\\n\\nJamon Bikini: Too greasy for my tastes. It's pretty much a grilled cheese sandwich with some slices of Jamon inside. The truffle oil is a nice touch though.\\n\\nGnocchi: Way overpriced, as you get a tiny portion for $13 (essentially double the price of all the other tapas). The waiter said it was \\"amazing\\" so we were swayed to order it, but honestly it was meh. You could use the money for other items that are I think are tastier and better value.\\n\\nBone marrow: Interesting to try, but difficult to eat / dig out the bone marrow. Also very fatty.\\n\\nPaella: One serving of this ($16 for the vegetarian) is HUGE. Like enough to serve four people comfortably. But the problem was it was completely flavorless, essentially tasting just like fried rice with vegetables. Some salt would also have been nice, because whoever made this seemed to have not added any. They also put this huge scoop of white mayonnaise in the center, which was frankly disgusting. Good quantity, low quality, but maybe the meat version of this is better?\\n\\nQuail: Good, I liked this. \\n\\nPotato Tortilla: I didn't really understand the point of this. It's like a flat bit of mashed potato served with some cream dipping sauce. Meh. \\n\\nAlbondigas: Tasty meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce. Pretty good. \\n\\nGambas al Ajillo: Nice, large shrimp. I liked it. \\n\\nCrepes: Really awesome, I think my favorite of the desserts. It's two crepes filled with cream and caramel and topped with a scoop of ice cream. Worth getting\\n\\nChurros: I like that this comes with a nice chocolate dipping sauce (a nice, slightly spicy and not too sweet Spanish chocolate sauce).

And I'm not really a fan of mustard sauces, but the honey mustard dip that came with my meal was amazing!\\n\\nThe server who brought our food to us was pleasant enough, and as our group got a drink or two in us and we started joking around and teasing him: first about him wanting to turn on the patio heaters on a beautiful warm evening, then about his inability to get them lit.

Let's just say Petrone's is not only a deli...it's a lifestyle. \\nI went to middle/high school in Melrose and the owner, Leo watched me grow from just a saucy bun to buffalo chicken calzone or a chicken caeser salad.  Wow how time flies.   I go to college in San Francisco, so I don't get the luxury of having petrone's whenever I see fit.  I'm not gonna lie,  when I go home if it wasn't for my mom picking me up, I think the Petrone's staff would be the first to people from home I would see.  \\nThe pizza is five stars there, its not too doughy not to stiff.  But I can get pizza any where, what I really ache for when I'm away is the buffalo chicken calzone or the chicken caeser salad with pita bread.\\nOK the buffalo chicken calzone, is the BEST way to eat buffalo style chicken, yes the BEST and it's only at Petrone's.  The calzone is stuffed with mozzarella cheese and Buffalo style chicken, that's it. Dip it in some bleu cheese dressing... and I'm gonna say it.. it's orgasmic. \\nAlright, so for those light dinner nights, the chicken caeser salad is the best pick. The caeser dressing if i remember correctly, Leo gets shipped from somewhere, like far away.  I don't remember where he said, but it's not something to joke around about, it is the best caeser dressing I've ever had.  The grilled chicken that goes on top has the perfect blend of herbs.   The pita bread that is on the side, is fresh out of the oven, they bake a new batch probably every hour.  \\nYou may ask why I know so much...I know because I care...\\nI'm going home in a week and I assure you that Petrone's will be my second meal...that's a promise.

Highlights from the tasting menu included the onsen egg, bathed in an incredible mushroom foam with homemade bacon chunks. The rich umami flavors were balanced out by the light and delicate foam. The first course, carabineros, a deliciously sweet prawn with compressed cucumber, grilled avocado and mango jelly was also noteworthy. The star of the show however was the desert: apple butter cake with brown butter ice cream,burnt toffee cream, and compressed apple slices.

There were so many good-sounding sides that we were a little overwhelmed.  The only thing that was weird was when I ordered my burger medium rare, she proceeded to explain to me what \\"medium rare\\" meant.  Yeah, dude, I know what it means already.  (On the other hand, my burger actually did come out medium rare, which is nice because I find that happens pretty rarely - no pun intended.)\\n\\nWhile I was impressed with my burger (I had the Butcher's Cut), the real hero of our meal was the sides.  I had the Pork Belly Mac 'N Cheese.  This dish is made with Israeli couscous rather than actual macaroni, and it is super rich and comforting.

She said it had too much bleu cheese and that it wasn't evenly distributed.  I am a big bleu cheese fan, and it was fine with me - but if you aren't super into bleu cheese maybe you should pick something else.  My other friend had the Shrimp Po Boyger and said it was great.

The sis and I decided to forego Voodoo's 30-minute long lines and tourist-defining pink boxes in search of a different donut experience. Yelp spoke, as it frequently does to listening ears and eyes, and so we hightailed it here on a Saturday morning. The promise of playing patronesses to such avant-garde donut makers, birthers of such flavor creations as Blueberry Bourbon Basil and (Hard) Apple Cider, was too tempting to pass up. They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day; I am inclined to agree. We needed \\"energy\\" for criss-crossing the rest of PDX in search of other gluttonous delights that day, and so 8AM it was. \\nThe creamy-white, open kitchen allowed one to peep without shame at employees preparing, on-the-spot-made donuts. Unlike the traditional donut shop layout, these donuts were sparsely enthroned behind a glass case, with single donuts proclaiming the wonders of its particular breed to the awe-struck customer. The way it works: one points, the order is taken, the donut is made (or at least, glazed or puffed or adorned). The representative donut stays enthroned upon its little perch to enlighten the world of grownups in search of a donut just for them. \\nBeing a Gen Yer, I knew the choices would be paralyzing. I pre-empted my Gen Yer disposition towards vacillation; I went with the Blueberry Bourbon Basil. Sis chose the traditional buttermilk. We threw in a Key Lime Curd to make it complete. The latter was devoured within half a minute; powdery and custard-filled, literally a puff of key lime pie; one's acute key lime pie craving  may not be sufficiently satisfied by that puff. But it wets the taste buds and so perhaps you could head on over to the likes of Random Order or the Pie Spot or some other specifically pie establishment immediately after, to finish that craving for limey-sweet goodness. \\nThe real test of Blue Star, however,  awaited with my choice of BBB: a bite revealed the triplet flavors of Basil, Bourbon, and Blueberry, in that order, one after the other. Moment of consideration. I like basil on margarita pizza, basil sandwiched by drippy mozzarella cheese and firm tomato slices, basil bits baked into a square of focaccia...and yes, my learning palate hesitates only slightly to declare, basil in a Blueberry Bourbon Basil donut. Unexpected, momentarily shocking, but welcomed. At least for this first visit to Blue Star. The donut itself being airier than your usual, my stomach was perhaps deceived into thinking, \\"YEA, maybe this isn't so unhealthy a breakfast after all!\\" Keep on believing that, patroness of avant-garde donuts, keep on believing. \\nP.S. The buttermilk traditional was scrumptious. \\nP.P.S. The (Hard) Apple Cider Fritter will be mine next time. I do not vacillate.

If there is something on the menu that you would like to absolutely include with your selections, then you can request to have these items put in the queue. Also, eating meats is a good thing if you go to this place. The meats are all made to order and taste great! Anyway, we had a group of 8 and there was plenty of food.

Exposed brick walls, beautiful paintings, candle lit tables; it's classy without feeling fancy or fake. They have a great selection of craft cocktails, beer and wine for reasonable prices. My fiance and I ordered a wonderful bottle of red for dinner that I believe was under $20 (can't quite remember; we finished the thing). \\n\\nThe menu is excellent and offers a variety of classic Italian staples to satisfy your need for traditional fare, as well as new dishes to keep you interested. We struggled with our decisions because everything just sounded so wonderful! We started with the mussels - always a good idea. Delicious buttery white wine broth and perfectly cooked. For the main courses, we ordered the Mushroom Truffle Risotto and Italian Job Pizza. That risotto was by far the creamiest, most luxurious dish I have ever tasted at a restaurant. Forget truffle mac & cheese and mashed potatoes - this is the real deal. The Italian Job pizza was also excellent - rich, flavorful sauce, tasty sausage and big dollops of fresh goat cheese. Oh and the crust (obviously the most important part) is great. Thin and bubbly with brick oven flavor and just a slight bite of dough to keep it from being too crisp. \\n\\nAt this point, we were full (and pretty tipsy) but I had to order the Tiramisu for dessert (such a sucker for that one).

Almost all the dishes they prepared, from the grilled tri-tip, to the crab-cakes, to the mussels were good if not excellent.

The taco was also really good and for $2.50 it's a steal. The food was so good I ordered the plantains... Again OH my gosh. Just amazing and fried to perfection ! They came with this creamy sauce that added so much flavor. I then got another chicken taco, and a fruit skewer from the kids menu. Needless to say my small bite to eat turned into a lot more. \\n\\nI would give BarTaco 5 stars except for the fact that I had to keep reminding the waiter for things I asked for which wasn't a lot (a straw and a kids menu). I had to ask at least 3 people for a straw before I eventually got up went to the bar and got it myself ... There goes that 5th star. But regardless I would definitely be back! \\n\\nPs: the complimentary valet parking is great !"},{"name":"Cafe Paisano","address":"182 W State Rd 434, Ste 1000","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"If you want a great meal , great service this is your place.

The fish fry they do on Friday's and sometimes Saturday's is absolutely the best. They use Haddock and it is cooked perfectly. The meatballs are excellent ,  garlicky and the right mix of meats and homemade. The Fra Diavolo (spicy) red sauce is fantastic, I get it with broccoli and garlic and it is so damn good .

Overall, I'd go back, but there were some service issues that left me giving this a 3 star when it could have been a 4 star review (food was good!).\\n\\nWe had a reservation for 5 people at 9:30pm and were seated at 10. 30 mins late... and the bar was SO crowded that we felt like we were in the way the whole time we waited... No comped drink for the wait. Thank god we had a reservation b/c they were telling people it was a 2.5 hour wait when we showed up! Be forewarned, make a resi. The bar is giant, which is nice for the South End. It was packed, like NYC packed. \\n\\nWe sat, and the tables are nice--not too close to each other, not too cramped. I'd say the majority of people were in their 30s, it wasn't a young crowd which was nice. It was a lively crowd. And it was nice to see a restaurant that wasn't all old white people sitting around with their chardonnay. This was a cool group.\\n\\nWe had 2 waiters, we ordered water and they confirmed that we'd been to a tapas restaurant before. They came back with water and we ordered sangria for the table.\\n\\nThen we ordered food. Here's what we got:\\nShishito peppers-standard, pretty good.\\nGambas al ajillo / Shrimp with garlic-shrimp was slightly overcooked, but the garlic sauce was delicious\\nTruffle salad--one of the highlights of the dishes for me. Really good, slivers of black truffle, sweet apple, a whipped cream that I thought might have been whipped fromage blanc or something super mild, but it was really cream! It was surprisingly delicious.\\nWhipped sheep's cheese--good, but not memorable\\nChorizo with Fig--I didn't have this, but the table LOVED it\\nBrussels sprouts--this was another highlight of the night for me, really delicious with a great spice--maybe harissa? So yummy and crispy. The top thing in my opinion.\\nShort ribs--I didn't have any and didn't notice anyone talking about them\\nMushrooms and herbed goat cheese--this was really good--nice vinegary kick.\\nPaella--we got 1 serving of the seafood and 1 of the meat version. I liked the seafood version, but I think people preferred the meat version. The clams were slightly overcooked, but the crawfish was delicious, the rice was well done and had a bit of char in some places that was good.\\n\\nFor 5 people, we had some leftover paella, but probably could have used another dish. \\n\\nThe main issue was the service--we had 4 plates of food (and finished them) before our sangria arrived. I had to ask the guy filling the water glasses to go check on it for me. (We had the flora version of sangria--it was good, but not the best sangria I've ever had). Someone at the table ordered a coke and it literally came with the paella, which was the last thing to arrive. COME ON. That's ridiculous. They did give us churros to go at the end of the night, but we were all going in different directions, so it was kind of a lost gesture since they were packaged together.\\n\\nThe waiter was loud which was nice is such a loud restaurant, he was nice. But I wish he'd checked on us between taking our order and things arriving. He also implied that we ordered too much for 5 people, when really, we probably could have ordered more and been happy.\\n\\nWhen I go again, I'll get that salad, the brussels sprouts, and the mushrooms, and then change it up and try new things. I'll also definitely make a reservation for the early side, and then call to see if it's looking like it will be later than planned.\\n\\nFor sangria, wine, and the above dishes, it came to about $65 pp. Not too shabby!"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere; unique menu; awesome tasting foods, though a few are hit and miss.\\n\\nTakeaway the Krispy Kreme shake please.  \\n\\nI'd go again if I feel like spending $20 for a decent burger!"},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"12196 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"I so love all the Mod Pizza locations which keep popping up all over.

Disney really did a good job with decorating and creating the ambiance for this restaurant. It is located in Asia in Animal Kingdom, and the vibe this place gave off, was a lodge near Mount Everest. It matched with the decor and style of the area for the standby line on Expedition Everest (best ride I've ever experienced on Disney property!).  There were brown chairs of different styles, some ornately carved, some simple. Lots of browns and red for the color scheme. And in front of us was a huge figure with a bird mask.

It was served on a bed of rice, which I like because I can't live without that. There were some sauteed red peppers, carrots, mushrooms, onions and bokchoy. A bit soggy. They tasted like the frozen veggies you'd get at the store, and they only added bokchoy and fresh cilantro to make it more asian. \\n\\nOverall, this was a decent and filling dish, if not a bit pricey.

You will not be disappointed by the donuts, but you will probably get a bit of a sticker shock on your first visit.\\n\\nHowever, the space is clean and neat. The donuts change constantly.

I called about 15 places in Cambridge and Somerville, all of whom wanted my party to meet a minimum balance and have my guests order off of a fixed price menu.\\n\\nBut when I called Tavern in the Square, the manager on duty talked to the owners and kitchen staff, and said the magic words to me: \\"No problem.\\" I rejoiced that I had found my dream place that would accommodate my crazy request.\\n\\nThe actual party went perfectly. Tavern in the Square had reserved the entire back space for us, so my party of 40 had our own space where things weren't too loud. The manager on duty, Angelo, was available that night and personally kept coming in to check on how things were going. We had three servers all to ourselves, who were prompt, efficient, and friendly. We got to order off of their full and very extensive menu, and everyone I talked to was satisfied with their meals (the fried avocado was a hit!). My sister came and even brought her 3-month-old baby, which the restaurant happily accommodated. Plus, many of my guests got to watch the Bruins game that was on that night.

The building itself is pretty sweet. It has the feel of a log cabin mixed with a micro-home, and I think that's awesome. Some of the tables appeared to be old, crank-operated types that you'd see in the Edwardian period. The food is amazing, like I broke into heaven and devoured the angels themselves.

Country fried steak, gravy, doughnut, and a habanero jam. Finished it off with a Black Betty. It was superb.   \\n\\nThe only things I didn't like....the atmosphere seems confused inside. Rustic cabin bursting at the seams with TVs? Come on, I'm already fat and dying from the food but  now I have to yell over them to make conversation too?

Clearly the laws of physics have not been covered in their high school. I look at my 2 cups and I'm tempted to try and pour the entire contents of my medium cup into my small cup right there at the counter, instead I head over to the cover area and carefully pour my medium into my small cup, stick a lid on it and sip from the remaining contents of my medium cup.

Hands down best breakfast tacos in Austin.  It torches Torchy's and smokes Taco Deli.  The main reasons:  taste, quality of food, and price.  I never have that swollen veins fast food feeling you get with the other Breakfast Taco joints.  My wife and I have sensitive stomachs and can do damage here with no ill effects!  And it's nice that there still is a place in Austin that doesn't charge California prices for outlandishly good tacos.  Very old school South Austin feel to the place, (the one caveat is I suggest calling ahead if you have somewhere to be, otherwise plan to take your time and linger with your taco, it can get busy!)  Dog friendly on the outside patio with the occasional live music, especially on weekends.  They have a great many toppings to play with.  Warning:  your first time in the menu can be a bit daunting with all of the choices.  My favorite tacos:  Egg White w/ white cheese, simple, healthier than your average taco and delicious.  Potato, White Cheese & Guacamole.  Or simple Potato & Egg.  Their black bean & egg is equally good depending on your mood.  And for Migas lovers:  The Migas taco is the real deal.      Their verde sauce is excellent and is the standard red.  You will find yourself craving this place weekly.

I had the pleasure of being a first-time customer on 9/18 when visiting Boston for a long weekend...Amrheins was on the radar for a few reasons (its historic and non-touristness, location near the Westin where I was staying, its unique menu items, and great Yelp reviews).\\n\\nWhen I arrived after a once-in-a-lifetime Fenway Park Red Sox experience (Green Monster seats), I was in bad need of a relaxing sit-down meal and my NFL fix.  Seated in the bar dining room, I got both.  Began with a Caesars salad and jumbo shrimp cocktail, culminated with the signature luscious-decadent lobster pie -- wow is all I can say (funny thing is it looked smallish but it in reality was oh so filling with lump lobster meat and a delicious seasoning).  Ended up with homemade strawberry shortcake dessert, yummy.\\n\\nJenny's patient, friendly, helpful service topped off a wonderful dining experience.  Dinner here was really a treat all the way around as well.  I must say that as I was near the kitchen entrance, everything that came out (from other seafood and meat entrees to appetizers and burgers) looked totally delicious.  I definitely want to come back the next time I visit Boston.\\n\\nTip:  Amrheins, via its delivery driver, does offer shuttle service to nearby hotels.  But you can take the Broadway Red Line to South Station and catch other transportation easily (I did that to Silver Line and was back to the Westin in under 10-15 mins total)."},{"name":"Bridges Cafe & Catering","address":"2716 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Recommendations for this place were high. \\nOn a late Sunday morning, you can expect a little bit of a wait.

Vegetarian/homemade/organic selections.\\n\\nCons: Service was extremely slow and not very friendly. They need to bring on additional waitstaff because you will end up holding your check for about 10-15 minutes and wait even longer to place your order. Don't plan on having your drinks refilled. Potatoes and other dishes that should be served hot were cold and pretty bland. Coffee was really watered down. These are the basics that should be nailed down by most restaurants and Bridges really missed the mark on the simple things.

With a $25 gift card, it still isn't even worth it. I am seriously unimpressed. \\n\\nNote that this spread is stupid as hell if you do not at least get 2 $12 plates, 2 $10 plates, and 1 $7 plate. You save $.10 this way, but swap out any of those others for another $7 plate and you're better off ordering them one by one.\\n\\nThe spreads: I loved the htipiti one, at least I can figure that out from the menu, but the other spreads, I have no idea. The guy who brought them out didn't bother to waste his breath telling us what they were. My guess is one was eggplant and the other was the potato one, which just tasted like hummus. \\n\\nFor the plates\\nzucchini fritters - I liked these, but damn that saffron yogurt was strong. For $7 for some little balls of fried shredded zucchini, you can make your own and not have to pay for the saffron.\\n\\ncalamari - my boyfriend ordered it, I won't touch it. He only ate half. He said it was the worst calamari he ever had. Usually he will eat something even if it's bad. \\n\\nsaganaki - it was okay. I've only had it one other time in my life and don't remember it. \\n\\nlamb pie - this was the only thing I would order if I was forced to come back here. \\n\\nlamb shank - somehow this lamb was awful compared to the lamb in the pie. The accompanying sauce did nothing to help it out.\\n\\nThe service sucked. I am sorry I did not wear my pearls and I don't have enough wrinkles on my face to warrant any attention from the people working here. There were long periods of time when my water glass was empty. The server was not very interested in explaining the menu beyond the fish. It gets really annoying when the people bringing food out play musical chairs with everything on the table and just leave the empty plates. Both tables on either side of us had all sorts of attention on them and there we are in the middle like we rolled in dirt and came in.\\n\\nThe ambiance sucks. While the whole like Hercules movie set looks cool, the closeness of tables does not work with Americans. I do not need to hear about Betty's latest botox session next to me. It really seems like a place to throw money at food and be seen. Not in a million years.\\n\\nAt least the valet guys were nice.

Since I always have a place in my heart for a good sandwich, I had to check it out. \\n\\nThe outdoor seating area is obviously quite popular, as suggested by the sign near the entrance suggesting that anyone who wants to sit indoors does not need to stand in queue. You can't tell from the outside, but there is plenty of seating inside (though mostly for smaller parties) and the place has a somewhat pub-like feel. I took a seat at the bar, contemplated one of their many beers, and decided to ask for a suggestion from the bartender/server on what sandwich to try.\\n\\n\\"Well, it depends on what you're feeling like.\\" And she was right, there is a type of sandwich for almost any type of appetite. Hearty meatloaf? The indulgent daily special of beer-battered, deep-fried mussels? Since I didn't feel like spending the rest of my day fighting a food coma, I settled on the \\"Blue Ginger\\" sandwich (created by Ming Tsai) - a grilled yet perfectly rare (and it is RED inside) tuna steak that is brushed with a teriyaki glaze. The condiments (lettuce, tomato, avocado slices, wasabi mayo) were the right combination, but the wasabi mayo wasn't strong enough to leave an impression or contrast. Overall, it was quite fresh, delicious, and well-seasoned...BUT (always a but w/ me, sorry that's how I roll) I think that focaccia is not structurally appropriate to hold together this surprisingly girthy sandwich. The bread, while perfectly toasted, herbed, and not too oily, inevitably gets weighed down and soggy from the fillings...leaving you with more sandwich on your hands than in your mouth. I took took to eating the rest of this with a fork and knife, which sorta defeats the whole point of it being a sandwich, doncha think?\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Asian slaw served w/ the Blue Ginger was sort of an afterthought. Although it had a nice sesame flavor, there was a missing acidic component, and the square-cut napa cabbage just looked sloppy (a thin julienne would have been much more appetizing to the eye).\\n\\nAfter I was done with my sandwich and fully satisfied, I was already thinking of what I wanted to try the next time I am in town.. But one question lingered: if the concept is to get the best chefs in Boston to create the menu...then why are so many of the sandwiches made by the Parish Cafe chefs???"},{"name":"Otto & Anita's European Restaurant","address":"3025 SW Canby St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious!

The menus have a lot of similarities but 5th Quadrant is much better.  It was quite busy when we went in but we were able to get a seat w/in 10 minutes.  The seat was pretty uncomfortable and we were squished in next to other tables, they could stand to rearrange the place a bit so that it is more comfortable.  We were pretty floored by the stench of body odor that our waitress had.  At first we couldn't figure out who stunk so badly but after a while we figured it out.  I was horrified every time she came over, especially when she brought over our food.  It was seriously pretty gross.  I feel badly saying something about our waitress, she was nice enough but I can't even begin to tell you how bad the stench was.\\n\\nAnyway, the menu was pretty veggie friendly and I love how you can order smaller portions...small salads, cups of soup, stuff like that.  We got the hummus plate and after how delicious the one at 5th Quadrant was I was so excited for it to arrive.  I also got a small salad that had hazelnuts and blue cheese on it and a cup of vegetarian chili.  The hummus plate was OK but all of the veggies were cut way too small to dip into the hummus which was a bummer.  The feta was broken up so small I had a hard time even getting the fork to pick it up to put on the delicious warm pita bread.  The salad was OK too, I forgot to ask for it without dressing which was a bummer because it had way too much dressing on it.  Also, the blue cheese and the hazelnuts were so small they were hard to taste, it seemed to be mostly lettuce.  The vegetarian chili was good, quite spicy actually.  \\n\\nPaul got this chicken sandwich that had applewood smoked bacon, avocado, and a few other veggies along with a cup of clam chowder.  He liked his food but he agreed that the food at 5th Quadrant is much better.  \\n\\nOverall I would say everything was OK.  Not sure if I would be in a rush to go there again but if we ended up back there one day that would be fine.  But, I would probably walk out again if that same waitress was there.

The Yelp Elite Event last evening was a true hit from start to finish.  There was an extensive menu of various types of sushi--cooked and uncooked--as well as tempura options.  They ranged from something delineated specific at the restaurant as the \\"Two-Timer Roll\\" which is cucumber wrapped to the Georgia roll to a Pulled Pork roll to one of the greatest culinary creations I can ever think of known as the Cheeseburger Roll, which was my absolutely favorite and I think is the resident staple of this 11-month old restaurant.  I do wish there was more of the Cheeseburger roll to sample, as it was not really enough of it to go around.  There were all kinds of gourmet burgers to sample, including a scrumptious Turkey Burger smothered in Brie with dried Cranberries which was both savory and sweet, and a Bleu Cheese Burger where the bleu cheese was not particularly overpowering but will be noticed at the very end of the mastication process.  I must say that both were quite good.  The caveat here is that all of these burgers have very fancy and upscale names but I'm more prone to remember them by the specific tastes and ingredients rather than the names provided them by the specific restaurant.  The ambience was cool and enchanting, with what I believe is a full bar.  They created a refreshing little gin- and -lime based cocktail with club-soda to top it off with candied ginger as a garnish which the gin being purchased and incorporated from a local distillery in the Old Fourth Ward, which is Atlanta's only distillery since Prohibition.  I love supporting local and locally-owned establishments.  There were also various chips and dips, with my favorite being a crab-based diet.  There were no dessert dishes which I think may be the only thing missing, and perhaps they can foster a dessert roll which may also be a favored menu item (s).  I had the chance to meet the Sushi Chef, who was both kind, knowledgeable, and endearing.  What a great man! We ended the evening being bedazzled by the guitar and singing skills of the Co-Owner, Marcus, who wrote an original song to commemorate the occasion.  What a truly talented and equally business-savvy gentleman.  Overall, this has the potential to be one of Atlanta's classic and unique spots and I and my family will certain come to sample the delicious food once again.

There's no sign for this outside to alert you to this. The door just says they open at 8am. \\n\\nSo good, we went two days in a row! Although the 2nd visit wasn't quite up to par with the 1st visit. My rating is more of a mash up between the two days. In brief, based on both visits I understand the occasional mixed review in here, but all in all I'll definitely return on my next visit to Vancouver. More details on the Day 1 & 2 experiences below if you're interested. \\n\\nDay 1 - showed up about 8:50am on a weekday - already a huge line! We probably waited 35+minutes, but they managed the line well, and once we got in--wow. Loved our server, amazing and funny, attentive, knew the food very well. I had the Salmon Fume and Chai Latte (and loved it so much I repeated my order the next morning). Most of our group was obsessed with how good their bacon was--thick cuts cooked perfectly, and everyone absolutely loved their food and drinks. Despite the wait it was a 5-star rating. \\n\\nDay 2 - wanted to beat the line, showed up at 7:50am, and we were first in when they opened the doors, but a line rapidly formed behind us. This is the day we realized why there's such a line; people are seated until the tables are full, but since they don't start food orders until 9am, the tables stay filled as people have coffee and waffles until they can then order their brunch at 9am. This particular day they also had a computer system issue that was stressing the staff out upon opening. They weren't attentive and forgot things. There was lots of complaining at the tables about missed food, and several of us witnessed some type of manager telling the staff on the dining floor to encourage people to leave if they were lingering over coffee too long so the crowd would start to clear. Not the most 'welcoming' thing to hear as you are enjoying your meal. The line outside moved very slowly and the food took forever; not living up to Day 1 at all. However, in the end, the computer issue got solved, our same waiter was extremely apologetic and went from frazzled to the awesome personality we had met the day before, and when the food was delivered, the whole table was very satisfied with the food and the remaining service. (Great finish pulled it back up to 3-4 star brunch in the end)."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I ate at Hopdoddy on Congess.

The pizza came 10 minutes before the quoted time and was still hot (free delivery, btw). The delivery guy was nice to me and even called when he got here, since my doorbell is broken. My only complaint is that the mushrooms were obviously canned, but given the facts that everything else was spot-on and the price was incredible (under $14, including a 20% tip), that didn't bother me. I will be ordering here again because I FINALLY found a place with a chewy crust that I like. It's lightly crisp on the edges, and when you bite into it it's nice and chewy (but not so chewy that it gives your jaw a workout!). I also dug that the crust wasn't so flimsy that all my toppings slide off when I pick up a slice. \\n\\nBottom line: I'd say my experience was worlds away from the other reviewers.

We didn't really know where we wanted to eat after spending a half hour perusing various Back Bay menus. We eventually settled in here. My woman is a pseudo vegetarian (no red meat, but likes chicken), so I'm surprised she agreed to eat here since there is pig on every sandwich save one. Our waitress was quite friendly and patient, giving us extra time to decide on our meals. I eventually ordered Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich and a Coke, while my lady friend ordered the Zuni Roll (without bacon) and a Coke. The first thing we loved about our sandwiches was the bread. It was very fresh, different, and delicious. There, however, was not a second thing we loved about our sandwiches. It ended with the bread. I found mine to be very plain, basically just a baked chicken sandwich. My girl could not find the vegetables on her sandwich, although the menu description promised there would be some. The service was good as we were asked if we wanted refills on our Cokes three times, even though our glasses were still half full. I did remark that the Coca-Cola tasted like ass. It was not syrupy enough, no sweetness at all. We finally finished our sandwiches but we didn't want to leave so we each asked for another Coke. They  smiled and salivated, although at the time we didn't know why. Then we got THE BILL. $10.00 for 4 Cokes! WTF! OMG! Are they serious? They charge $2.50 per crappy Coke. I was/am still flabbergasted. I can't even mention the word Coke to my counterpart as she hits me when I do. So after the bill and tip, our \\"cheap\\" sandwich date costs us a whopping $38.00. Unacceptable. I feel that they should warn us unassuming consumers that they are about to rip us off with expensive mediocre liquid confection before they fetch our beverages.

Came here for the Cheap Date Night Prix Fixe menus served on MONDAYS & TUESDAYS only!

I didn't even realize I was already there because you wouldn't expect it to be in this location/building\\n\\nAnyways, review for the date night sets! They have 4 or 5 different ones you can choose from. There were 4 of us, so we got the Hot Date (spicy dishes) and the Pig Out Date (pork dishes)\\n\\nHot Date: dan dan noodles, tofu & veggies, hakka eggplant, garlicky black-coal chicken wings\\nFavorites were DEFINITELY the chicken wings & dan dan noodles\\nThe wings were pretty black but it came with this amazing dipping sauce! I think it had bleu cheese in it, but I couldn't tell until after I found out. Crispy sweet/spicy on the outside with a nice cool salty dipping sauce. Delicious!\\nI was excited for the hakka eggplant, but it didn't turn out like I thought it would.. Not as sweet/spicy as I've had it at other places.. tasted kinda bland to be honest\\n\\nPig Out Date: (we got this mainly because we wanted to try the pork buns) pork belly buns, mama chang's dumplings, triple pork mushu stirfry, brussel sprouts with bacon\\nFavorites: DUMPLINGS! so so good. Fried BEAUTIFULLY on the bottom, nice flavor inside. I wish they came with more in one order! Although I guess it didnt help that there were 4 of us sharing :P\\n\\nI wanna come back here for lunch one day though! At night it's too dark... so I don't think the moms and dads who always want MORE LIGHT at dim restaurants will enjoy this atmosphere.. \\nIt's also so dark, that you can't really see the color of your food, or if there is anything weird in it.. I usually like to see and admire what I'm eating!\\n\\nAnyways, overall a really unique place with good flavors.

Chocolate and raspberry is my guilty pleasure, so when I saw this flavor combination I eagerly purchased one. I took a lick of the frosting, and thought it was just perfect - so I eagerly cut into the cake to take a bite. Dense. Dry. Crumby. I was so disappointed. The filling (explained as a chocolate raspberry ganache) lacked the fruit component and I was overall disappointed. I licked off the remaining frosting, because it was perfection, and tossed the cake. \\n\\nThat night I was chatting with a friend about my experience, and he said that his was absolutely delicious, and I must have had an \\"off\\" cupcake. Well, the next day the truck happened to be back at my workplace, so I thought \\"I will give them another try.\\"  I got a 4 pack to share among friends, and figured that would be the best way to make a solid decision. This time I picked their churro flavor, the cookie dough one, a midnight snack, and cookies got creamed. Once again I found that the frostings were delightful, and in these varieties the fillings were spot on too - but I found the cake to be dense and dry. \\n\\nI'm glad I got to give this truck a try, but I don't think I will be back. From their stellar ratings on Yelp, I'm assuming that the dense cakes do appeal to some, they just aren't my cup of tea.

We have used their online or telephone ordering for curbside service and have been mostly happy. We thought we'd try Red Robin, as we heard their burgers were good. We placed our order between 7:30-7:45p in hopes of having those burgers before it got too late. We figured since it was past traditional dinner rush, it wouldn't be too long a wait to get our order.\\n\\nI arrived at curbside and called the number posted on the sign. The employee told me the order would be right out. After over 10 min, I phoned back to ask if it was indeed out shortly. They asked again who I was, and told me they'd have to check. Again, I was told it'd be right out. After nearly 10 more minutes they brought the order out and I drove home. It took much longer than anticipated, but we were happy to have the order. After arriving home we had completely the wrong order, not one item in the bag matched what we'd ordered. I drove back to the restaurant to simultaneously be met at the counter with a frustrated customer who was informed that I had taken her order. She expressed frustration at me (as though I wanted her burger with pineapple on it. Eww). \\n\\nI spoke with the manager. Yet, after another substantial wait, received the order. I arrived home after 9p and the burgers went right into the refrigerator. It was simply too late, close to bedtime to eat a heavy burger.\\n\\nAs I rewarm the burger today with guacamole that has now browned and lettuce that may have once been not wilted, the description of the burger quality doesn't match what is sitting on my plate. Perhaps they more closely match when you can eat it right after it's prepared. \\n\\nIn summary, we were not happy with the experience and we wouldn't recommend the restaurant for you either.

The food was mediocre at best, the management was arrogant and condescending, but the waiter service was good (she was doing her best given the complete lack of support by her management).\\n\\nJust to be clear through this whole story, the waiter service (I can't remember her name, she was French) was as perfect as it could be given the circumstances.  She did her absolute best even though her management completely unprepared for the evening.\\n\\nWe went during Magical Dining month, so we did expect the restaurant to be busier than usual, so we had reservations for 8.  When we arrived, it was much less busy than expected.  We were seated immediately.  Great!  That's where the fun ended.\\n\\nWe were informed that there was a rehearsal dinner taking place at Hannibal's on the Square (apparently owned by Chez Vincent owners) and that the kitchen was backed up.  Not a big deal I thought, we'll have more drinks, however \\"backed up\\" was the understatement of the night.  It took over an hour after ordering to get our appetizer.  Another hour after that to get our main course.  After my friend and I were fed up, we made our issues known to the manager.  His response was \\"Well, we do have a rehearsal dinner going, but as you can see, this place is very popular\\".  Typed words do no justice to the level of condescension in his voice.\\n\\nI am not concerned with how popular your restaurant is.  You as the manager should have known that you're completely incapable of handling the wedding party and standard dinner service at the same time, but instead you tried to make a few extra bucks.  The lack of experience showed.\\n\\nSo another 30 minutes has past since the main meal (that's 2.5 hours now since we've ordered) while we're waiting for the dessert, and that was enough.  We said, forget it, give us the check.  We're done.  The check was the only thing that was done with any punctuality.\\n\\n\\nBut you're saying, maybe the food makes up for that, right?  No.  No it does not.  It was bland, very boring in both presentation and creativity, and had seemingly very little effort.  I had a pork tenderloin, steamed vegetables, and mashed potatoes.  That's a very simple meal that I didn't expect a world of flavor out of, but it somehow made me think of a frozen meal.  The meat was lukewarm and bland.  The steams veggies were alright, not great. And the mashed potatoes had chunks and was flat out cold.  As in, stuck in the fridge cold.\\n\\nThe summation, I will not be going back, ever.  I brought a group of out of town friends here and it ruined the entire night through the poor service but also since we wasted 3 hours of our night here."},{"name":"Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I had a great celebration dinner at Gusto's.

Still scratching my head on this one.  The biggest issue I had was actually finding \\"The Factory\\". The website and North Cross Mall signage does not reflect that it is now called Wild Chix and Waffles. I spent forever trying to find \\"The Factory\\" even calling to see what stores it was by. I was having a hard time understanding that this Wild Chix place was one in the same. The new name and exterior with orange and yellow awnings and awful flying banners like you see at Camp Gladiator boot camps, totally threw me off. I honestly thought it was a fast food fried chicken place like a Raising Canes, not the adorable place I originally saw online. When researching this establishment for a friend's bday breakfast, the website and pictures gave off a vibe that this was a cute, hip waffle joint. We came upon a family on our way inside, who looked just as confused as we were. They had previously dined here when it was The Factory and raved about the drinks, but ended up going to the breakfast place a few doors down. We almost did too and I imagine a lot of others are as well. When we walked in, we asked what the deal was and the employee there told us there was a branding change. The interior decor looks to be the same as what we saw online, rustic looking with a mixture of random seating from comfy couches, to table sets, arm chairs, and even swings. I honestly don't know the vibe they are going for or who their audience is supposed to be? Is it supposed to have an eclectic coffee shop feel?Is it a craft waffle place? A fried chicken joint? It's like someone from marketing threw up and several different concepts landed under one roof. \\n\\nThat said, their ordering system is a breeze. Select what you want from waffles to drinks on an ipad. The food itself was very good. I had the basic brunch waffle and my friend the soul sista. The serving size was ample and the soul sista came with a ton of golden, crispy chicken on top. I had a bite and it was yummy! Mine was good too, although there was a mystery white cream which I don't remember seeing any sort of description about on the menu. I ate it anyway. The part that was MOST baffling about this whole experience besides the hodge podge decor meets Los Pollos Hermanos, was having a waffle concept WITHOUT syrup. How in the world can you sell waffles, breakfast waffles at that, and not include syrup??! My friend's did come with a teeny tiny amount in a teeny tiny silver container, but mine did not. When we asked for some more, we were charged a $1.63 for an apothecary-like, small, glass bottle. WHAT?! That's like going to a BBQ joint and charging extra for the BBQ sauce. My mind exploded; I'm still baffled by that. \\n\\nOther pros: high chairs available for kids\\n\\nSome suggestions for improvement:\\n1. Go ALL the way with the rebrand. You can't still have a place with mixed signage, it's confusing to new and existing patrons. Case in point, the family who went to eat at First Watch instead. Branding can't be half ass. Change your website and let people know there is a concept re-design and name change. Be consistent with all signage. North Cross Mall signs still had The Factory and there were both names present within your actual restaurant.  \\n\\n2. Include syrup with your breakfast waffles. It's. a. waffle. place. Maybe instead of providing crazy straws, use the money to serve your customer's waffles WITH syrup. I can appreciate that maple syrup is costly and food waste is alive and well in america. If that's the concern, offer regular syrup and mention maple is extra, or provide a tableside dispenser to cut back on containers that may have wasted content."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply amazing.

After posting my previous two star review, I was contacted by Eddie V's management to try to make things right!  That in itself is great kudos for the company.  Anyway, they invited me and my boyfriend back for a couple of entrees on the house.  This time I tried the fillet mignon and the bf got a tuna steak.  Both of them were completely out-of-this-world good.  Granted, they KNEW we'd been in before, wrote a bad review and were coming back for a \\"do-over\\" - I think some things could have been more \\"special\\" because of it - perhaps the service (which was spot-on) - but it seems unlikely that our dishes would be that far and above what the normal output would be for other patrons.  We really liked our food this time and left full and happy, chalking up our first experience to maybe just happening to pick the worst thing on the menu?  We really appreciate that Eddie V's went the extra mile to correct our bad experience.  We will come back again.\\n\\nFIRST EXPERIENCE: I went there with my boyfriend and we got a shrimp cocktail appetizer for $15 that was FOUR shrimp.  We split a swordfish dish and the sauce was way over vinegared and the meat wasn't too tasty.  Was edible but didn't seem like the dish was put together by a chef that knew how flavors were supposed to go together.  We thought it was quite overpriced for mediocre food.  Plus the fact that we had three waiters (in an effort to have better more on the spot service) but none of them were anywhere to be found when we actually needed them.  Would not recommend, there are so many better places to eat in Austin...if you must have steak and seafood, Truluck's beats the pants off of Eddie V's.

My friend and I were both torn between two sandwiches and the waitress gladly offered some suggestions to help us choose.  I ended up going with a special sandwich featured during the summer months only and it was perfect.  Tasty, not too heavy, with lots of complex delicious flavors.\\n\\nWe were in and out in an hour, which is impressive for a popular Back Bay joint during lunch hour on a gorgeous August day.\\n\\nParish wins again in my book!"},{"name":"Saxon Pub","address":"2500 Hwy 71 E","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Horribly rude bartender, no please and thank you.

I eyed her separate empanada menu. Beef. Chicken. Pepperoni and cheese. Just cheese. Ham and cheese. And lots more options, each for 1.50. I went with the beef, chicken, and pepperoni empanadas. But she ignored me and gave me beef, pepperoni, and just cheese. Fine. They were fantastic! I thought they might be homemade, so I asked. And yes they are. She said I had to try their Chilean sandwich and I promised I would next time.\\n\\nIn hindsight, I should have ordered 4 empanadas. So, if you're hungry get 4 instead. That's all I have on La Mamma for now. I'll update my review after I try the Chilean sandwich.\\n\\nUPDATE: I tried the beef chacarero sandwich. Its got a lot going for it: it is made with La Mamma's own bread, it has lots of steak, and interesting toppings like green beans, some kind of garlicky Chilean guacamole, tomatoes, and mayo.

There's lots of delicious eats, from bratwurst with onions and sauerkraut, to chocolate fondue, to caramel popcorn, and more. That being said, I suggest you come here looking to snack, not to eat, as everything is on the pricey side. It's not so expensive that you will ignore the tempting aromas around you and leave hungry, but the cost is steep enough that you will probably grumble with dissatisfaction as you forfeit your shekels.\\n\\nIx-nay on the smoking inside the market, but as busy as it was, I was able to duck in and out several times for puffs with no fuss and no waiting.\\n\\nIt's five dollars at the door, which I think is a little high considering not only the admission prices of other markets, but the asking prices of the vendors.

Nope - she instead took rag/mop they they use to clean up countertop spills and proceeded to wipe my lid off and put it back on the cup.  Is a new, clean lid that much of an inconvenience/expense that they're okay with serving a drink with a dirty lid?  I'm not okay with it and as a paying customer I don't expect to be treated poorly when I ask for what I order or call them on sanitary issues.\\n\\nWe've tried really hard to give Dancing Goats multiple chances.

If you are a true foodie, this is not the place for you...\\n\\nI was distracted by a phone call and my toddler daughter and ended up ordering the wrong breakfast omelet.  Instead of ordering an omelet with sausage and bacon, I ended up getting one with ham and salsa on it.  Normally, I love salsa and thought to myself, maybe it'll be house made salsa.  No, when it arrived the presentation was slightly lacking with a medium round sized amount of obviously jarred salsa on top of the omelet.  Personally, I think it's real skill to know how to cook eggs properly, and I felt hat my omelet was slightly overcooked.  Putting jarred salsa on top of an overcooked omelet is something that I can make myself.  Actually, it's what I do when I have left over salsa in the fridge.  Unfortunately, this breakfast was nothing out of the ordinary to me.  \\n\\nI wanted to substitute the home fries for something else b/c I had made home fries for breakfast yesterday morning, but the waitress said that they don't do that there.  So, I tried to be optimistic and thought that they might be tasty.  Nope.  They were tasteless and didn't taste good at all.  They didn't have a potatoey taste about them, and while they looked crispy, they were actually somewhat soggy.  \\n\\nThe only thing that tasted yummy to me was the scali bread toast which came pre-buttered.  I put on some strawberry jam, and they were tasty, until I found that one side was completely burnt.  How can they serve that to a customer?  I didn't eat that piece.  Research has shown that charred foods are linked to cancer which is why Chinese parents around the world tell their kids not to eat too many barbecued foods.\\n\\nLast, but not least, I noticed that they use Garelick Farms for their orange juice.  I am a big OJ drinker and have tried almost every brand.  I like Garelick Farms the least b/c it has a very sour taste and also happens to be the cheapest brand.  Knowing this fact, it gave me a good information about what kind of place this is.  Originally, I didn't want to order OJ since I get it at home, but the smoothies here are made with a pre-packaged mix, not fresh fruit.   Everything here seems to be pre-made/pre-packaged, nothing notably fresh or unique aside from the 80s theme.\\n\\nService was good.  The servers were quick to get me a high chair.  Although it was somewhat confusing who my waitress was b/c I believe I was helped by a few of the women there, but oddly, they all kind of looked similar to me, slim frames, long dark hair, face jewelry, etc.\\n\\nI really don't know if I would come back again.  Most likely not, unless friends insisted upon it.  I would certainly try other items on the menu.  Overall, this place is more about the theme and not the food, sorry to say...I did enjoy listening to the 80's music in the background though."},{"name":"Boston Super Dog","address":"46 Newmarket Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"DO NOT order the pastrami combo.

We had the paella, a fricasse and a flatiron beef sandwich.  The fricasse was ok, the paella like Daniel L. mentioned below was really salty,  the flatiron beef sandwich was quite good.  We also had the lavender latte and salty caramel latte, both are interestingly good but not to my standard of a good cup of coffee that's full of aroma and flavor (I'm from seattle and now live in the bay area which is full of the 3rd wave roasted coffee).

They didn't have primary political front runners marred by extra-marital affairs, dangerous and contagious diseases, a violent middle east... nothing like that. It's all just peachy keen with your tablets and smart phones.

As the kiddies started to amass, incensed by insults, I settled down before shoveling what was left of my food into my mouth. Still chewing, I stood up and put my studded earring back in (I always take it out when I eat) before giving them all what fer. \\"You see me as you want to see me,\\" I began, eggs falling out of mouth, \\"in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.\\" Everyone was kind of ignoring me at this point so I cut it short. \\"Sincerely yours,\\" I began, lifting my cup to down that last drop of OJ before pointing to the sign.

At some point, we did consider switching place, because there was no way we all sit in the sun in the 95+F weather. About 15 mins later, we were moved into the private dinner room up on the 2nd level in the restaurant with amazing view and A/C. That's when the party started. We probably went through the entire cocktail menu and some of the beer selections, no negative complain at all! Food and drinks were very good.

Pretty disappointing. Formaggio is like half a mile away from this place, for $22 I expected at least something quasi exotic, this charcuterie plate looks like something I could make out of my fridge. We also got half a dozen oysters which tasted fine but whoever is doing the shucking back in the kitchen needs a refresher course. Not having bits of shells in the oyster is shucking 101. Also some of the oysters were destroyed, like in pieces. Moving onto the main course, we got steak frittes, again for $22 but it was honestly what I would expect from ordering steak at TGIF. A little too tough. Not the greatest cut of meat and some garlic parmesan fries that were meh. Also for some reason the steak and the oysters came out at the same time, five minutes after we got the charcuterie plate.

I am quite passionate about my noodle soups and this, by far, has been the most inedible noodle soup I have ever eaten (well, tried to eat).  The ingredients I mentioned above were alright in there own sense, but what made the dish inedible was the soup itself.  The soup had a taste unlike any other.  I am still undecided whether it tasted like the chef forgot what he was cooking or used the soup to wash his feet before serving it.  Anyone that has experienced authentic Asian noodle soup will know that you drink the soup after eating the rest of the contents.  In the beginning, having just received the bowl of noodles, I happily brought up a decent sized clump of noodles and began to slurp it up, then the taste hit me like a bullet train. At that moment, the very idea of drinking that soup was thrown out the window and down into the storm drains to rot forever.  If that doesn't tell you how my experience went...

Also, the mojito is dangerously good. I've had Joshua twice as a server and he's so, so nice and attentive, and the hostess Winn (Wynn?) is extremely friendly and accommodating. Also, I think the decor and overall design vision is charming.

I really really really liked the port wine derby cheese because it combined the deliciousness of a sweet wine with a savory cheese. Mmm. But all 3 cheeses & the sausage were delicious regardless.\\n\\nThen I ordered a side of Brussels sprouts (you knew this was coming).

I only had a few bites (ok an entire slice...and a half) of the flat bread and it smelled and tasted amazing. The flavors were very subtle but mixed well together.

I would say the food is the reason I give Terra three stars instead of four, although I vacillated between the two rankings.

It had been open in one form or another since the late 1800's and was originally two separate establishments; Locke's and Ober's, one a bar and one a restaurant.  This place definitely has an old-school clubby feel, with several private dining rooms, dark wood paneling and the famous silver service in the main dining room.  From what I read, the restaurant was men-only until 1976, which is pretty mind-boggling.  \\nLO was starting to fade away until a few years ago, Lydia Shire bought the place.  The shut the place down, gave the place a hardcore cleaning and touch up without getting rid of the charm.  She also fixed the menu.  The food is still classic New England seafood and steaks, but each dish seems to have a little \\"Lydia twist\\" to them which I think is a great thing, something you do not expect.\\nI always get the sirloin, it is as good as anything in a top steak house.  If you eat fish (I don't), you have to get the JFK stew.  It got the name because JFK used to come in to LO and get the lobster stew so much that they named it after him.\\nThe service is typical high end restaurant, lots of people waiting on you, but they are not snooty or overbearing in any way.\\nFor seating, if you are going there for a date or with one other person, ask for table 121.  It is a table for two at the near end of the dining room in between the two entrances to the dining room.

I have a weird fascination with Fish Tacos even though I've never really had a good set served up to me. The day has come, these Fish Tacos were excellent. Served with Fries is a little odd, but it was still ok. I'll forgive them for not giving me a pickle because that would have been a little weird even if the menu had promised one. Amanda liked her sandwich, and from my perspective it was pretty big, with really thick slices of bread. Not for everyone, but it did look good.\\n\\nThe Summer Shack did not have much of a vegetarian menu, which is a downside if that's who you are bringing with you, but overall a good meal for everyone.

Choosing Desta Ethiopian Kitchen was the quickly scrambled Plan B. \\n\\nWe had never been to an Ethiopian Cuisine restaurant before. We have had a sample of Ethiopian cooking at a friend's place, but that wasn't much to go on to make any level of judgement. There was some doubts as to what the restaurant would have to offer.\\n\\nThis restaurant was decided on based on a 'word of mouth' recommendation from an acquaintance of Ethiopian origin. \\n\\nAs you drive up to the restaurant (Free Off-street parking lot), for 1st timers like us, it did not provide a welcoming feeling. It is very much like a shack. It turned out very much UNLIKE the website. As you enter and wait to be seated, if you take one more step, you'll probably walk out the back!  It has a bar, if you can call it that. Just enough bar stool seating for 4, provided there's no one sitting at the tables just behind. \\n\\nDesta has a very Cafe' like. The small size of the restaurant lends itself to being cosy and comfortable. Perfect environment to enjoy a drink and a meal with friends. Perfect for groups. That said, you will need to allow them time to set up tables if you're in group of 4 or more. \\nThe decor is very basic. Lit on the darker side. Simple square tables joined up as required. \\n\\nBeing a totally new cuisine for us, the Menu has some very interesting items. Not unusual but interesting. We ordered the Foul (pronounced Fool), the Sambuza as appetizers and they went down very well. Fresh and very tasty. \\n\\nMost of us went for the Tibs for entree's. Fish Tibs, Chicken Tibs & Lamb Tibs, on the Non-Vegetarian side and Vegetable Combo and Split-Pea Stew on the Vegetarian side. All orders are served with Injera (spongy flatbread made with Teff flour). I, personally, didn't care much for the Injera. Too soft and spongy for my liking. Others in our group liked it very much. \\n\\nDesta has a decent selection of Beers, Red & White Wines. Ethiopian wine is also offered. Dry or Sweet. Nice wines with a tad unusual taste. Ethiopian Beer was also available which is has a very British name - St George's Beer! \\n\\nThe service was excellent. Food was brought out within reasonable time. The staff were very helpful and ready to help with any questions we had on the menu. \\n\\nThe music played was easy rock / 80s, 90s / top 40 songs. But we hardly noticed the music over the chit-chat and fun we were having. \\n\\nThe quality, the food, the atmosphere are well worth the approx $25 per head for a dinner meal at Desta Ethiopian Kitchen.\\n\\nBest judge of the overall quality of the restaurant is the answer to: \\"Would you come back here\\". A unanimous answer: \\"Absolutely\\" \\n\\nA wonderful evening in excellent company of good friends at a very nice restaurant."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Indian food with a nice, fun atmosphere.

I remember the night when I discovered that it was finally open.  The hubs and I were driving by one evening when I yelled \\"BARLEY SWINE!!!!\\" in the car to his surprise and dismay - he was driving after all.  I knew through the silent language couples have that he was thinking \\"WTF are you talking about\\" and quickly explained that I've been watching this place and we have to try it.  Period.  I immediately got online when we arrived home to find whatever info I could.  That's when I saw that it was from the same creator as Odd Duck and they had a NYE menu...  I called.  They were already booked.  I was mad - \\"How did everyone else already know about this place?!?! Why wasn't I informed of the NYE menu?!?! Arghhh!\\"  I was sad.  The hubs, the smart man that he is, suggested we just go and check it out. \\n\\nI was excited and had HIGH hopes.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is small and it was incredibly busy.  We sat at the bar and ordered beers from a thoughtful drink menu.  We had already eaten dinner earlier, so we only ordered a couple of items: a stuffed pig foot special and sweetbreads (my favorite).  The pig foot was truly delicious AND included an egg with a runny yolk (my weakness).  However, my sweetbreads were disappointing.  They were plated as 4 or so large pieces.  We were only given forks and they were difficult to cut.  The first sweetbread was fine - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and well seasoned.  Unfortunately, the remaining sweetbreads weren't the same.  They were tough and the largest piece wasn't trimmed well - there was a huge vein, or something like it, running through the entire sweetbread that made it chewy and almost inedible.  Overall the flavors were good, but I didn't get the WOW effect I have with Odd Duck.   \\n\\nI agree with Jennie C. that the portions, both drink and food, are on the smaller side + pricey (I had a little sticker shock when we got our receipt), and that the restaurant needs time to work out some kinks.  The service was wonderful and the restaurant has great potential!

However, brunch is awesome. The Babette's Benedict is amazing. I'm not an eggs benedict person, but the addition of filet mignon and sun-dried tomatoes in the hollandaise makes this perfection. They have great french toast and the omelets are the best in Atlanta. I hesitate to order omelets because they are always: 1. too big and 2. overcooked. You know how a lot of places cook your omelet and it is brown? Never at Babette's. I love their goat cheese and fine herbs omelet, which has been replaced with a spinach and feta omelet. The eggs are perfect. I really have nothing negative to say about the food because from the entree to the sides, it's all perfection. Their coffee is good too.  \\n\\nIt's usually crowded, so either get there when they first open (10:30) or make a reservation like I do on OpenTable. \\n\\nI was there at the beginning of February with a group of 7 and we did have an issue with the valet.

There's so much on the menu it's a bit overwhelming. But the good thing about this place, if you are vegetarian, you have a ton of options! WHICH IS GREAT!

We saw people with a ‚Äãreally long plastic bottle of beer like the ones you see while you're on spring break. Gnarly dude. \\n\\nWe got sat down and the waitress came to us. We told her we were ready to order, but she said to give her a minute. She left and after a while she finally came back to us. She asked us what we wanted to drink, we said water and that we wanted to go ahead and order. She said she will be back with our waters and will take our order. She disappeared and we were literally waiting 5 mins. 5 mins may see short but it's not when you're coming back with waters. Then she takes our order. The food takes forever to bring us our food. She did not come back to refill our waters. We had to ask other waiters to give us condiments and extra plates. She never comes to check on us. Then she finally comes when we are done with our food. We asked for our checks. Yet again we are waiting about 10 minutes for her to bring us our checks. She never came, so we ended up going up front and then she finally gave us our checks.  \\nMy friend didn't want me to leave any tip, but I felt bad so I left a little. But she had an attitude when she handed us the check. SHAME SHAME. \\n\\nThe food on the other hand was good. We ordered a side of truffle fries to share. Which was really good! Then my friend ordered a vegetarian chicken bowl and I ordered the entree chicken salad which was pretty good. The only sad thing was there was no chicken to be found... Sad day. There's also the small and large portion. I ordered the small and it was plenty! The price of the food was ok for what you get. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is like your typical sports bar.

Some solidly delicious vegetarian items too, though you'll want to check on the ingredients when you order a particular item.\\n\\nThe rotisserie chicken is also really tasty (and not expensive either) -- I don't usually eat chicken but I like that the chickens are regionally produced, and are fed vegetable feed without antibiotics. L'Epicerie's quiche is fantastic and they usually have a few different kinds on offer (but you'll want to ask them to heat it in the toaster oven instead of the microwave -- give yourself an extra 10 minutes for that since it's sacrilege to ruin a nice quiche in the mic!!). Desserts are excellent too - the tarte tatin is just how it should be (sugary apple goodness), and pain au chocolat is yum. Interesting imported French sodas too.

With a ton of different pubs in Town Brookhaven, it's easy for There to slip through the cracks, but the food is amazing.

We stopped in for a small bite before the 6th Avenue Street Fair. The salad was quite good. The \\"house made\\" tamales much less so. The tamales themselves weren't all that bad. The rice side was meh. The refried beans side was close to disgusting. The sauce on the side was out of a can. And nothing on this plate was hot - closer to luke warm. $7.75 glass of Pinot Noir was fine.\\n\\nAtmosphere is pretty cool (as others have pointed out). Service was fine.

These donuts are a must. Voodoo's got nothing on this. They use some fresh ingredients and are all made fresh. They have an open kitchen, so you can see their whole process. Everything was soft and fresh and delicious. The berry flavors came out really strong. There is plenty of seating inside and Stumptown coffee is ready to go. The guy working on the donuts and the cashier were both really friendly and took their time because I was overwhelmed with the choices.

Do you like moist flavorful turkey? Then, Terry Black's BBQ is for you.  At first, when they were cutting our turkey to order, I was worried that there was no visible dry rub on the outside. It looks like a hunk of naked chicken at first. But, boy oh boy, the turkey was very juicy and oh so tasty! The jalape√±o cheddar and reg sausage were also moist and seasoned well.  The pork rib was fall-off-the-bone tender and had a delicious rub.  The only misstep was the brisket (we got moist) which lacked flavor.\\n\\nAs for sides, I loved the green beans! Still bright green and not that cooked to death color that I see a lot in bbq joints.  The potato salad and coleslaw were excellent. The watery creamed corn was okay (Rudy's is the best in my book). I liked that the condiments bar includes take-home containers and two types of bread (honey wheat and white) for self service. \\n\\nAll in all, I thought it was a great bbq experience.

Due to their popularity, this place does not take reservations and operates like a Japanese Ramen shop, if your party is not complete, then they won't seat you. \\n\\nI enjoyed a lavender latte($3-5), delicate and the 8 oz is just the right size for a not regular coffee drinker like me. We were recommended the Fricasse ($14-17?) dish over the Paella, and looking around, almost all dishes came out presented in a hot cast iron pan, this makes sense to keep the food warm on a crisp wintry day, in additional to a unique presentation. Our Fricasse's short ribs weren't exactly too tender, thus the 4 stars, though the topping of veggies and the perfect sunny side up eggs made it still a very enjoyable dish. Love the slice of thick toast on the side. \\n\\nLastly we enjoyed the waffle ($3.15) + white chocolate sauce ($1 each topping), this is actually my fav part! crispy light waffle, just the touch of sweetness with the sauce, yummy!   =)\\n\\nWill organize some small group outings here in the future!

The medium spiciness that we asked for was mild at best and my chicken tikka tasted of burnt plastic [!!!!!]--not a good taste and made me feel ill after eating it--this was a huge turn off.  We also ordered 2 orders of naan and it was very skimpy--we assumed they forgot one of our orders.  The mango lassi is now served from packaged bottles--we will probably not order them again.  As I was visiting in Boston, I've had much better experiences with Indian food in California and probably would go further down Centre Street to look for something else to eat.  It was basic Indian fare and the others in my party seemed to enjoy the other dishes [the only reason I gave them a second star], but that taste of burnt plastic from the chicken tikka really soured my experience."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best burgers in town, so worth the wait!!

You can only add so much donut to your menu before it's just conspicuously gimmicky.  That being the case, many of the menu selections are tediously heavy and overly sweet due to the needless addition of a donut or two.  If they would focus more on offering a thoughtful artisan menu, separate out the doughnuts, and focus on some more inspiring cocktails, I think they'd be closer to getting it right.  The only other thing that is difficult to deal with, is the outside seating consists of insanely short picnic tables that seat you so low to the ground that your knees are thrust up near your shoulders as if you were sitting on some sort of awkward \\"squatty potty.\\"  This particular yoga pose is not ideal for the comfortable consumption of fried, gladed, iced, and filled confections.
